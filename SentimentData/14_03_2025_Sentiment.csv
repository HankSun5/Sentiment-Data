In a move that has sent ripples through the tech industry, OpenAI is advocating for the U.S. government to consider banning AI models originating from the People’s Republic of China (PRC), specifically naming DeepSeek, a prominent Chinese AI lab. This isn’t just about competition; it’s a serious escalation of concerns around data security, intellectual property, and the very nature of AI development in different geopolitical spheres. For those in the cryptocurrency space, where decentralization and security are paramount, this development raises crucial questions about the future of AI and its potential impact on our digital world. Why is OpenAI Targeting DeepSeek and China AI Models? OpenAI’s proposal, submitted as part of the Trump Administration’s ‘AI Action Plan’ initiative, paints a concerning picture of DeepSeek. They label DeepSeek as ‘state-subsidized’ and ‘state-controlled,’ alleging that this connection poses significant risks. But what are the core arguments behind this dramatic call for bans on China AI ? Data Security Concerns: OpenAI argues that DeepSeek, like other PRC-supported operations, is legally obligated to comply with Chinese government demands for user data. This raises red flags about privacy, especially when these models are used globally. Intellectual Property (IP) Theft Risks: The proposal explicitly mentions the ‘risk of IP theft’ as a consequence of using ‘PRC-produced’ AI models . This suggests OpenAI’s worries extend beyond just data privacy to encompass broader economic and technological espionage concerns. Tier 1 Export Rule Countries: OpenAI recommends extending these bans to all ‘Tier 1’ countries under the Biden Administration’s export rules. This broad stroke aims to create a firewall against potential security vulnerabilities and IP risks across nations considered strategically important. It’s important to note that OpenAI’s accusations are not entirely new. They have previously accused DeepSeek of ‘distilling’ knowledge from OpenAI’s own AI models , violating their terms of service. However, this latest proposal marks a significant escalation, directly challenging the integrity and security implications of DeepSeek’s operations due to its alleged ties to the Chinese state. DeepSeek’s ‘Reasoning’ Model R1 Under Scrutiny One of the specific targets mentioned in OpenAI’s proposal is DeepSeek’s R1 ‘reasoning’ model. OpenAI claims this model, along with others from DeepSeek, is inherently insecure due to the perceived state control. But is this concern justified? Let’s break down what we know: Aspect OpenAI’s Claim Context & Nuance State Control DeepSeek is ‘state-controlled’ and influenced by the PRC government. While DeepSeek’s founder met with Xi Jinping, direct evidence of state control is not explicitly provided. DeepSeek originated as a spin-off from a quantitative hedge fund. Data Access Chinese law compels DeepSeek to provide user data to the government. This is a valid legal concern for any company operating under Chinese jurisdiction. However, the extent and nature of data access in practice remain debated. Model Security DeepSeek’s models are inherently insecure due to potential backdoors or data siphoning. DeepSeek’s open models are hosted on platforms like Microsoft, Amazon, and Perplexity, suggesting they lack built-in mechanisms for direct government data extraction. The ambiguity in OpenAI’s proposal regarding ‘models’ is also noteworthy. Are they referring to DeepSeek’s API, their open-source models, or both? This distinction is crucial because open-source models, by their very nature, are more transparent and less susceptible to hidden backdoors. The fact that major tech companies are hosting DeepSeek’s open AI models suggests a level of scrutiny and trust within the tech community, even amidst these allegations. What are the Broader Implications of Banning ‘PRC-Produced’ AI Models? If the U.S. government were to act on OpenAI’s proposal and implement bans on ‘PRC-produced’ AI models , the ramifications would be far-reaching. Consider these potential impacts: Escalating Tech Cold War: Such bans could further fuel the ongoing tech rivalry between the U.S. and China, potentially leading to a more fragmented global AI ecosystem. Innovation Slowdown?: Restricting access to certain AI models and technologies could hinder innovation, particularly in areas where cross-border collaboration is beneficial. Market Disruption: Businesses and developers relying on ‘PRC-produced’ AI models would need to find alternatives, potentially incurring costs and delays. Setting a Precedent: This move could set a precedent for other nations to impose similar restrictions based on geopolitical considerations, further segmenting the global tech landscape. AI Policy and the Crypto World: A Convergence? For the cryptocurrency community, this OpenAI proposal and the broader debate around AI policy are deeply relevant. Here’s why: Decentralization vs. Centralized Control: The core ethos of crypto often revolves around decentralization and resisting centralized control. OpenAI’s concerns about ‘state-controlled’ AI resonate with these values, highlighting the potential dangers of concentrated power in emerging technologies. Data Privacy and Security: Data privacy and security are paramount in both the crypto and AI domains. The allegations against DeepSeek underscore the importance of robust security measures and transparent data handling practices in AI development, mirroring the crypto community’s focus on these principles. Geopolitical Influence on Tech: The OpenAI proposal demonstrates how geopolitical tensions can directly impact the tech industry, potentially shaping regulations and access to technologies. This is a crucial consideration for the crypto space, which is also navigating evolving regulatory landscapes across different nations. Navigating the Complexities of Global AI Development OpenAI’s call for bans on DeepSeek and other ‘PRC-produced’ AI models is a stark reminder of the complex interplay between technology, security, and geopolitics in the age of artificial intelligence. While concerns about data security and intellectual property are valid and warrant serious consideration, the path forward requires careful deliberation. Unilateral bans could have unintended consequences, potentially stifling innovation and exacerbating international tensions. As the AI landscape continues to evolve at breakneck speed, open dialogue, international cooperation, and a balanced approach to security and innovation are crucial. The cryptocurrency community, with its inherent focus on decentralization and security, has a valuable perspective to contribute to this ongoing conversation.

41615523,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=692637,1741908581,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/41615523.jpeg,Federal judge instructs Trump administration to reinstate fired workers in 6 federal agencies,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/judge-orders-trump-reinstate-fired-workers/,"A federal judge in California has ordered six federal agencies to promptly reinstate thousands of probationary employees fired last month. U.S. District Judge William Alsup said on Thursday that these employees from the departments of Agriculture, Energy, Interior, Treasury, Defense, and Veterans Affairs should be given their positions back immediately, describing their terminations as “sham” proceedings that evaded legal requirements. The ruling directly affects those let go last month who had served less than one year in their positions—or less than two years for those categorized under “excepted service”—but exempts individuals considered “mission critical” at their respective agencies. These workers were informed of their dismissals through a performance-related email, according to the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), which filed the lawsuit on behalf of tens of thousands of affected staff. Although Judge Alsup limited his ruling to six agencies, he left open the possibility of broadening his order in the future to encompass more of the government. Judge Alsup said the administration labeled certain good employees as poor performers Alsup, who was nominated to the bench by former President Bill Clinton, declined to dispute the government’s general authority to lay off employees. Instead, he ruled that the process undertaken by the administration did not adhere to the law. During remarks delivered from the bench, Alsup singled out the administration for labeling certain employees as poor performers when official records showed that they had met or exceeded expectations. “It’s a sad day when the federal government would fire a good employee and say it’s based on performance when they know good and well that’s a lie,” he said. “That should not be done in our country. It was a sham to avoid statutory requirements.” Trump defends his decision to cut the Education Department workforce while in a meeting with the Prime Minister of Ireland on Wednesday. Source: Associated Press The mass firings drew on data from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), which indicated that more than 200,000 federal employees, about 10 percent of the civilian workforce, had held their positions for one year or less at the time of the terminations. This figure can also encompass recently promoted workers, as promotion resets an employee’s probationary clock. AFGE and other challengers allege that rather than following established protocols such as thorough reviews or extended probationary periods, agencies executed an across-the-board termination directive. Justice Department attorneys contend that each agency’s leadership acted within its rights, saying the administration was authorized to remove employees for performance reasons. However, Alsup criticized the government’s behavior throughout the case. He said that he isn’t questioning the government’s authority. However, the firings must done via the proper legal process. White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt blasted the court’s decision, calling it “an absurd and unconstitutional order” and insisting that “a single judge is attempting to unconstitutionally seize the power of hiring and firing from the Executive Branch.” Leavitt added that “the President has the authority to exercise the power of the entire executive branch—singular district court judges cannot abuse the power of the entire judiciary to thwart the President’s agenda.” D.O.G.E’s aggressive staff reduction turned various agencies into legal battlegrounds This clash follows months of staff reduction measures led by the Trump administration, accompanied by cost-cutting plans championed by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Analysts project that DOGE’s directives will either directly or indirectly eliminate around 500,000 federal positions in the coming years. In addition to dismissing probationary workers, the administration is offering a voluntary resignation program and has instructed agencies to craft “reduction in force” proposals, aiming to downsize departments even more. Supporters of these cuts argue that the federal government has grown too large and needs to be streamlined to manage tax dollars more responsibly. Critics assert that abrupt mass firings, coupled with the absence of orderly procedures, could cause chaos in departmental operations and violate workers’ rights. The cutbacks have also turned various agencies into battlegrounds, with legal disputes popping up across the country. One of the newest challenges came on Thursday from a coalition of 20 states, led by Democratic attorneys general, who have sued the administration over plans to slash the staff of the Education Department by nearly half. Attorneys general from Arizona, California, Colorado, New York, Wisconsin, and other states filed the lawsuit in Massachusetts, contending that the proposed downsizing is unconstitutional and would cripple key services for students nationwide. “Firing half of the Department of Education’s workforce will hurt students throughout New York and the nation, especially low-income students and those with disabilities who rely on federal funding,” said New York Attorney General Letitia James. “This outrageous effort to leave students behind and deprive them of a quality education is reckless and illegal.” Education Department spokeswoman Madi Biedermann countered that the Trump administration is acting according to the authority granted by voters. “President Trump was elected with a mandate from the American public to return education authority to the states,” she said. The workforce reduction plan, which includes around 1,950 staff reductions—1,315 of whom are federal workers—is, in the administration’s view, valid under the law and consistent with existing guidelines. Biedermann added that employees working on student-loan servicing, federal student aid, and discretionary grants remain on duty, and civil-rights investigations are continuing. The Education Department employs about 4,500 staff, making it the smallest cabinet-level agency. Nonetheless, the White House is expected to press forward with an executive order aimed at dismantling the department entirely. According to earlier reports by Cryptopolitan , Trump is urging Education Secretary Linda McMahon to coordinate the agency’s closure, despite the fact that no president can unilaterally eliminate a cabinet-level department that Congress has established. Congress must approve any measure to shut down the agency. Skeptics see this effort as part of a broader conservative agenda that has long questioned the federal government’s role in local education decisions. Under the Biden administration, conservatives criticized the Education Department for moves such as loan forgiveness programs and anti-discrimination measures for transgender students. Now, Trump appears eager to fulfill his campaign pledge of scrapping the department altogether. Polls indicate that most Americans oppose eliminating the Department of Education, citing concerns about weakening national education standards and sabotaging students who rely on federal programs. Critics warn that taking an ax to the Education workforce without proper planning could produce ripple effects in districts across the country, especially where local or state support systems are already overstretched.

Per an official release from the Irkutsk Oblast Prosecutor’s Office , officers confiscated 96 mining rigs from a facility in the village of Kazachye, in the Bokhansky District of Irkutsk. Illegal crypto mining appears to be on the rise in Irkutsk , Russia’s first and biggest Bitcoin mining hotspot. Illegal Crypto Mining – Thriving in Siberia? The prosecution service explained that an unnamed Siberian non-profit organization operated the “farm,” and installed the rigs in the orphanage.

However, it is still registered as an educational facility. An Irkutsk-based court ordered bailiffs to disconnect the mining equipment and “stop the misuse of the land.” Prosecutors said the farm operators endangered human life by “violating electricity and fire safety laws.” Officers said the operators “did not carry out preventive maintenance” for the “electrical equipment and wiring” they used. They also failed to install fire alarms and other safety devices, the prosecutor’s office added.

A local landmark in the Bokhansky District of Irkutsk, Russia. (Source: Nipiks & Co [CC BY-SA 4.0]) Is Russia’s Mining Ban Having an Effect? Crypto mining is illegal in many parts of Irkutsk Oblast – including the Bokhansky District – during the winter months. But it remains a draw to both illegal miners and above-board industrial players because of its low electricity rates. The region’s famously cold winters also mean that miners have to spend less on cooling fees. But this has led to massive drains on the power grid in both Irkutsk and neighboring areas. This, in turn, has led the Oblast’s governor to call for a year-round ban on crypto mining in much of Irkutsk until 2031 . However, these is little evidence to suggest that bans are having a deterrent effect on illegal crypto mining in Irkutsk or elsewhere in Russia. Leading Russian media outlets have reported that illegal mining farm operators are installing equipment in apartments, private plots of land, gardening associations, and inside commercial buildings. Energy experts have warned that many of these locations were “not built to cope with such heavy electrical loads.” As a Russia-Ukraine peace deal comes into focus, some investors are eager to do business in Russia again.

Analysts are calling the bottom for the dog-themed coin amid chatter for an ETF approval by the SEC. Dogecoin Price Eyes Fresh Rally As Bottom Is Spotted On-chain analysts say Dogecoin (DOGE) is poised for a massive upward price movement on the back of several positive technicals. According to pseudonymous Trader Tardigrade, Dogecoin is sticking to a macro channel that is indicative of the bottom for the memecoin. The analyst disclosed that while Dogecoin has deviated at the channel’s edge, recent price action predicted movement in the channel. With the bottom confirmed, the analyst says the only direction for Dogecoin price is a surge upwards. “If DOGE remains within the channel without deviation this time, it has already reached the bottom,” said Trader Tardigrade. Onchain analyst Ali Martinez shared sentiments similar to Trader Tardigrade’s projection, which predicted a strong resurgence. Already early signs of a resurgence are clear with Dogecoin rebounding from a key support level as traders eye $3. “Something big could be brewing for Dogecoin,” said Martinez. “A strong rebound may be right around the corner.” A Plethora Of Bullishness For DOGE A raft of experts are pointing to a breakout target of $0.6533 as confirmation of a 318% upswing for Dogecoin price. Analysts are pointing to higher lows on Dogecoin’s charts with Elliot Wave Theory indicating that prices are in a bullish wave. Outside of technicals, on-chain data confirms a 270% surge in active addresses, pointing to increasing ecosystem activity. Experts say rising whale accumulation in the ecosystem is a potential pointer for an impending Dogecoin price rally. For fundamentals, an approval for a Dogecoin ETF by the SEC could send prices soaring by triple-digit percentages. At the moment, the memecoin is trading at $0.1647 while daily trading volumes sit at a decent $1.44 billion.

The tokens were then transferred back to the main address of the World Liberty Foundation (WLF). The Trump family’s relationship with cryptocurrencies marks a significant shift from Donald Trump’s previous stance, which he called Bitcoin a “fraud” as recently as 2021. But he embraced digital assets during his second presidential campaign, vowing to make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the planet” at a Bitcoin conference in Nashville in July 2024. Trump’s proposed policies include reducing regulatory restrictions and advocating government hoarding of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Related News: As the Market Plummets, Giant Altcoin Whales Get Active - Here Are Their Latest Trades Following the Nashville conference, Trump and his sons founded World Liberty, a company that positions itself as a major name in the digital asset space. Despite initially lackluster sales, World Liberty saw a significant increase in token sales following Trump’s presidential election victory. According to data from Dune Analytics, the company has now sold $300 million worth of proprietary tokens.

41615786,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=139989,1741909232,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Update: Flipster Exchange Fortifies Crypto Data Security After Misuse Incident,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/flipster-exchange-data-security/,"In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, trust and security are paramount. Recent news surrounding the Flipster exchange has brought user data protection into sharp focus. Let’s delve into how Flipster is proactively addressing a data misuse incident and reinforcing its commitment to secure crypto trading. Understanding the Flipster Exchange Data Misuse Incident Flipster, a prominent cryptocurrency exchange, recently addressed concerns regarding a data misuse incident. It’s crucial to clarify what happened and what it means for users. According to Flipster’s official communication on Telegram, there was no security breach compromising the exchange’s systems. Instead, the incident involved a former customer support employee who, after leaving the company in January, misused retained customer data. This distinction is important: a misuse of data by an individual is different from a systemic security vulnerability. Key Takeaways from Flipster’s Announcement: No Security Breach: Flipster explicitly stated that their systems were not breached, alleviating concerns about widespread vulnerability. Former Employee Misconduct: The issue stems from the actions of a single former employee, limiting the scope of the incident. Legal Action Underway: Flipster is taking decisive action by pursuing legal measures against the individual involved, demonstrating their commitment to accountability. Financial Stability Reaffirmed: The exchange has reiterated its strong financial position, assuring users of its operational stability amidst the situation. Data Security Commitment: Flipster emphasized its dedication to data security and compliance, highlighting ongoing efforts to protect user information. Strengthening Crypto Data Security: Flipster’s Response In the wake of the data misuse incident, Flipster is taking proactive steps to enhance its crypto data security measures. This is not just about damage control; it’s about reinforcing user trust and setting a higher standard for security within the cryptocurrency exchange industry. What specific actions are they taking? Enhanced Security Measures: Internal Safeguard Review: Flipster is thoroughly reviewing and strengthening its internal safeguards to prevent similar incidents in the future. This likely includes stricter access controls and monitoring of employee activities. Data Protection Protocols: The exchange is likely reinforcing its data protection protocols to minimize the risk of data misuse, even by internal actors. This might involve enhanced data encryption, anonymization techniques, and stricter data retention policies. Compliance Reinforcement: Flipster’s reaffirmation of compliance with labor laws and data protection regulations underscores their commitment to operating within legal and ethical boundaries. Transparency Commitment: By openly addressing the incident and communicating with users via Telegram, Flipster is demonstrating a commitment to transparency, which is crucial for building and maintaining user trust. Why User Data Protection is Crucial for Cryptocurrency Exchanges This incident highlights the critical importance of user data protection in the cryptocurrency space. Exchanges handle sensitive personal and financial information, making them prime targets for both external attacks and internal misuse. For users, knowing their data is secure is non-negotiable. Why is this so vital? The Pillars of User Data Protection in Crypto: Trust and Confidence: Users entrust exchanges with their funds and personal data. Robust data protection builds trust and confidence in the platform. Regulatory Compliance: Increasingly stringent regulations worldwide mandate strong data protection measures for financial institutions, including crypto exchanges. Compliance is not just about avoiding penalties; it’s about responsible operation. Reputation Management: Data breaches and misuse incidents can severely damage an exchange’s reputation, leading to user attrition and loss of business. Proactive data protection is essential for safeguarding reputation. Preventing Financial Loss: Compromised user data can lead to financial losses for users through identity theft, phishing attacks, and account takeovers. Strong data protection mitigates these risks. Ethical Responsibility: Beyond legal and business considerations, there’s an ethical imperative to protect user data. Exchanges have a responsibility to safeguard the information entrusted to them. Navigating Cryptocurrency Security: Actionable Insights for Users While exchanges like Flipster are responsible for implementing robust security measures, users also play a crucial role in safeguarding their cryptocurrency security . What steps can you take to protect yourself in the crypto world? User-Centric Security Best Practices: Strong Passwords: Use strong, unique passwords for your exchange accounts and email addresses. Consider using a password manager. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Enable 2FA on all your exchange accounts. This adds an extra layer of security beyond just a password. Be Phishing Aware: Be cautious of phishing emails and websites that attempt to steal your login credentials. Always verify the website address and sender of emails. Limit Information Sharing: Be mindful of the personal information you share online and with exchanges. Only provide necessary details. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with security news and best practices in the cryptocurrency space. Follow reputable sources and exchange announcements. The Broader Landscape of Cryptocurrency Exchange Security Flipster’s situation is a reminder of the ongoing challenges and evolving landscape of cryptocurrency exchange security . As the crypto industry matures, security remains a top priority for exchanges, regulators, and users alike. What are the key trends and challenges in this area? Evolving Trends in Crypto Exchange Security: Increased Regulatory Scrutiny: Regulators worldwide are paying closer attention to crypto exchange security and data protection, leading to stricter compliance requirements. Advanced Security Technologies: Exchanges are adopting advanced security technologies like multi-party computation (MPC), zero-knowledge proofs, and hardware security modules (HSMs) to enhance security. Cybersecurity Insurance: More exchanges are seeking cybersecurity insurance to protect against potential losses from breaches and attacks. Community and Industry Collaboration: Information sharing and collaboration within the crypto community are becoming increasingly important for identifying and mitigating security threats. Focus on User Education: Exchanges are recognizing the need to educate users about security best practices to empower them to protect themselves. In conclusion, Flipster’s proactive response to the data misuse incident and its commitment to strengthening security measures demonstrate a positive step towards fostering trust and transparency in the cryptocurrency exchange ecosystem. For users, this situation underscores the importance of both choosing secure platforms and practicing personal security hygiene. As the crypto space continues to evolve, a collective focus on security will be paramount for its sustained growth and adoption.

41616243,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=139993,1741909845,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,BREAKING: US Senate Advances Controversial Stablecoin Bill Despite Democratic Resistance,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-senate-stablecoin-regulation/,"The world of cryptocurrency regulation is heating up, and this time, the spotlight is on stablecoins! Are we finally seeing some movement on Capitol Hill? Buckle up, crypto enthusiasts, because the U.S. Senate Banking Committee just took a significant step forward in shaping the future of digital currencies in America. Despite facing strong headwinds from some Democratic members, a bill aimed at regulating stablecoins has advanced. Let’s dive into what this means for the crypto landscape and what hurdles it still needs to clear. What’s the Buzz About the Stablecoin Bill? Dubbed the GENIUS Act, this stablecoin bill is designed to establish a regulatory framework for issuers of stablecoins. Think of stablecoins as cryptocurrencies pegged to a stable asset, like the U.S. dollar, aiming to provide price stability in the often volatile crypto market. The Senate Banking Committee, in a decisive 18-6 vote, gave the green light to this legislation, signaling a potential shift in how the U.S. approaches crypto regulation . Here’s a quick rundown of what’s been happening: Committee Approval: The GENIUS Act successfully passed the Senate Banking Committee with a significant majority. Democratic Amendments Rejected: Attempts by some Democrats to introduce stricter regulatory measures were voted down. Opposition from Senator Warren: Senator Elizabeth Warren voiced strong concerns, framing the bill as a potential national security risk. Next Steps: The bill now moves to the full Senate for consideration and awaits a counterpart vote in the House of Representatives. Democratic Pushback: Why the Resistance? While the bipartisan vote suggests momentum, it wasn’t without friction. Several Democrats on the committee pushed for amendments to strengthen the regulatory oversight of stablecoin issuers. These amendments, however, did not gain enough traction to be included in the approved version of the bill. This highlights a fundamental tension in the ongoing debate around crypto regulation : balancing innovation with consumer protection and financial stability. Senator Elizabeth Warren emerged as a vocal critic, raising alarms about national security implications. Her concerns stem from reports linking former President Donald Trump to a stablecoin project. Warren argued that this connection, among other factors, makes the bill a risky proposition, potentially opening doors to illicit financial activities. Her opposition underscores the deep-seated skepticism some lawmakers hold regarding the crypto industry and its potential risks. GENIUS Act: Decoding the Stablecoin Bill So, what exactly does the GENIUS Act propose? While the full text requires a detailed legal analysis, we can break down some of the likely key components based on general discussions around stablecoin bill frameworks: Aspect Likely Provisions in GENIUS Act Issuer Requirements Likely to establish criteria for entities that can issue stablecoins, potentially including licensing or registration requirements. Reserve Requirements May mandate that stablecoin issuers hold reserves of high-quality liquid assets to back the value of their stablecoins, ensuring 1:1 peg. Regulatory Oversight Specifies which regulatory agencies (e.g., SEC, CFTC, Federal Reserve) will have jurisdiction over stablecoin issuers and their activities. Consumer Protection Could include measures to protect stablecoin holders, such as disclosure requirements, redemption rights, and safeguards against fraud and manipulation. It’s crucial to remember that this is just one step in a long legislative process. The specifics of the GENIUS Act will become clearer as it progresses through the Senate and potentially the House. However, the committee’s approval signifies a growing consensus on the need to bring stablecoins under a regulatory umbrella. Why is Stablecoin Regulation Important? You might be wondering, why all the fuss about crypto regulation , specifically for stablecoins? Here’s why it matters: Financial Stability: Unregulated stablecoins could pose risks to the broader financial system if they become widely adopted and experience instability. A run on a major stablecoin, for example, could have ripple effects. Consumer Protection: Without proper oversight, consumers holding stablecoins are vulnerable to risks like loss of funds due to issuer insolvency, fraud, or lack of transparency about reserves. Combating Illicit Finance: Like other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins can be used for illicit activities. Regulation aims to mitigate these risks and ensure compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) standards. Innovation and Growth: Clear and well-designed regulations can actually foster innovation by providing clarity and legitimacy to the stablecoin market, encouraging responsible development and adoption. What Happens Next for the US Senate and the Stablecoin Bill? With the Senate Banking Committee’s approval, the GENIUS Act now moves to the full Senate for a vote. Its journey doesn’t end there. To become law, it also needs to pass a vote in the House of Representatives and be signed by the President. Given the ongoing debates and differing viewpoints on crypto regulation , the path ahead could still be bumpy. Key things to watch for in the coming weeks and months: Full Senate Vote: The timing and outcome of the vote in the full Senate will be critical indicators of the bill’s momentum. House Counterpart: Whether a similar or compatible bill emerges in the House will be crucial for bipartisan support and eventual passage. Industry Reaction: The cryptocurrency industry’s response and lobbying efforts will likely play a significant role in shaping the final legislation. Potential Amendments: Further amendments could be introduced in both the Senate and the House, potentially altering the bill’s scope and provisions. The Road Ahead for Crypto Regulation The advancement of the stablecoin bill in the Senate is a landmark moment. It suggests that despite internal disagreements and external pressures, there’s a growing recognition in Washington D.C. that the crypto space needs a regulatory framework. While the GENIUS Act focuses on stablecoins, it could pave the way for broader crypto regulation in the U.S., influencing how other digital assets are treated in the future. For crypto enthusiasts, investors, and businesses, staying informed about these developments is paramount. The regulatory landscape is evolving rapidly, and understanding these changes will be crucial for navigating the future of digital finance. The debate around stablecoins is far from over, but the Senate’s action signals a significant step towards bringing clarity and structure to this exciting and disruptive technology.

LTC Price Drops 15% & HBAR Surges 24%,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdags-170k-holders-ready-for-keynote-3s-big-reveal-ltc-price-drops-15-hbar-surges-24/,"The crypto market has been anything but quiet—prices are swinging, traders are watching, and the drama never stops. There has been an almost 15% Litecoin (LTC) price drop, dampening excitement that had built around ETF discussions. Meanwhile, Hedera’s (HBAR) price surge took the opposite route, shooting up 24%, keeping analysts on the look out for further gains. Meanwhile, the BlockDAG (BDAG) community is stacking wins. Having raised over $202.5 million and a community of over 170,000, BlockDAG is growing fast. Early backers have seen an impressive 2,380% ROI and with the upcoming Keynote 3 around the corner, speculation is running wild—some are already calling BDAG a top crypto pick for 2025. The Litecoin Price Drops Almost 15% The recent Litecoin (LTC) price dropped 15% in the last week. There was a brief period of optimism tied to possible ETF discussions but Litecoin’s price drop reflects shifting trader sentiment. Hopes for a new investment vehicle failed to sustain LTC’s short-lived uptick. Some traditional investors remain interested in LTC, yet the market doesn’t seem as inclined. The Litecoin price drop also comes as conversations about exchange-traded funds generate mixed outlooks for various cryptocurrencies. Though many believe Litecoin still has room to rebound, it may require more than ETF-related speculation to maintain stability–traders watch to see if LTC will drop further. The Hedera Price Surge Gets Traders Talking Observers have been discussing the recent Hedera price surge that sent HBAR climbing by around 24% over the last 7 days. Some traders interpret this Hedera price surge as an indicator of shifting conditions, particularly since the token recovered from a previous dip under key moving averages. Support at the 200-day mark offered a foundation, leading HBAR to push beyond the 50-day threshold. Analysts suggest a continued Hedera price surge might attract participants who see promising indicators in the current chart signals. The next key resistance for HBAR is $0.2429, and if broken, analysts predict a 40% to 50% additional rise. Many now look to see if this Hedera price surge will continue strengthening the token’s position. All Eyes On BlockDAG As Keynote 3 Launch Nears! The anticipation surrounding BlockDAG’s Keynote 3 has reached an all-time high, with traders eagerly tracking the presale’s momentum. The project’s strong track record has fueled enthusiasm, as past keynotes have triggered significant surges. The presale has shattered the 200 million milestone—raising more than $202.5 million from selling over 18.7B BDAG coins, with the current price at $0.0248 in batch 27— a massive jump from its initial $0.001 valuation. Early adopters have already seen returns of 2,380%, while the community continues expanding, surpassing 170K+ unique holders. As BlockDAG continues to break records with its presale numbers, all attention is turning to Keynote 3. Speculation is running wild, with many believing this keynote will be unlike anything the crypto space has seen. Rumors hint at a Hollywood-level production, with a big Hollywood creator behind the keynote—heightening curiosity about the scale and impact of the event. Crypto thrives on viral moments, and this spectacle could be the catalyst for the next major price surge. As the presale rapidly becomes a top crypto to buy in 2025 , expectations for Keynote 3 are soaring. The project’s funding total is steadily climbing toward the $600 million milestone, reinforcing the growing confidence in its future. The only question left is what’s coming next—new features? High-profile partnerships? Another major price explosion? Those looking to capitalize are moving fast, locking in their positions before the next big announcement. What Comes After These Market Shifts? Crypto never sits still. The 15% Litecoin (LTC) price drop has cooled ETF hype, while the 24% Hedera (HBAR) price surge has traders watching for the next breakout. But through all the market swings, BlockDAG has been on a steady climb, gaining serious traction. Its presale has smashed records—over $202.5 million raised, 18.7 billion BDAG coins sold, and early backers sitting on a massive 2,380% ROI.

In a new YouTube video, Benjamin Cowen tells his 886,000 subscribers that there probably needs to be a change in monetary policy in order for ETH’s chart against Bitcoin ( BTC ) to bottom. “But in order to have a change in monetary policy, you have to have pain. Welcome to the pain. This is the pain that you ultimately need. Remember last cycle [in 2019], ETH/Bitcoin bottomed after ETH/USD broke support.” Cowen notes that ETH fell below its support level against the US dollar in 2019 right before the Federal Reserve ended quantitative tightening. The analyst says that everything that happened in the previous cycle is “basically happening this cycle, it’s just taking place on a longer timeframe.” Cowen also notes that most of the price points of the current cycle are roughly 10x what they were in the 2019 market. “The reason why people are having a hard time navigating this cycle and why it feels so different is because monetary policy never changed this cycle. In the last cycle, we saw a change in monetary policy in the pre-halving year. We’re now in the post-halving year and we still haven’t seen a change to the quantitative tightening. We’ve seen them taper it a little bit. They’ve slowed it down, but they’ve never actually stopped it.” ETH is trading at $1,907 at time of writing. The second-ranked crypto asset by market cap is down more than 1% in the past 24 hours.

The markets are highly uncertain, partly because Trump has delayed tariffs, only to extend the pain for traditional traders. China and Canada have introduced their own tariffs, disrupting the global supply chain. Scott Bessent, Treasury Secretary, described this in-between period as a detox period, during which markets are still trying to adapt to the new spending cuts. Trump has declined to comment on a possible recession and has even hinted that financial pain will be necessary before things improve. For this reason, Bitcoin has found support despite some drops in price, as traders are seeking a safe haven in uncertain times. Meanwhile, supply chain distributions, with no clear end in sight, have only made Bitcoin a more attractive investment. The cryptocurrency market has experienced large pullbacks, but analysts have mostly seen these dips as buy-in opportunities rather than a bear market. According to the CPI, inflation is expected to fall from 3.0% to 2.9% in February. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy, is expected to drop from 3.3% to 3.2%. The trade war between Canada and America has calmed down slightly. Traders remain concerned about an economic slowdown, which could pressure treasury yields and push Bitcoin into another bull market. Using one-year inflation, the New York Fed survey projected an upswing of 3.0% to 3.1%. Traders, however, are seeing a possible rate cut in June, providing more support for Bitcoin. However, if interest rates remain high, the Fed may need to maintain higher interest rates. Bitcoin does not earn interest, so investors may be less inclined to buy cryptocurrency. Trump’s trade tariffs on aluminium and steel imports will go into effect on Wednesday. Job openings have already started to rise in February, anticipating the tariffs. “We expect core CPI inflation”, wrote TD Securities analyst, “to cool down in February following the January jump to 0.45%, as price resets came in firmer than expected in the services segment”. “We look for slowing in both the goods and services segments, with owners’ equivalent rent (OER) inflation dropping to a 3-month low. On a year-over-year (YoY) basis, headline and core CPI inflation are likely to drop by a tenth each to 2.9% and 3.2%, respectively”. Egg prices were a key driver of inflation, rising 53% in January from the year before. Conversely, average grocery prices rose 1.9% over the same period. Other products, such as tomatoes and bread, dropped in price, buffering the inflated price of eggs. Brooke Rollins, the Department of Agriculture Secretary, said that, due to Trump’s five-point plan to tackle bird flu, egg prices dropped to $1.85 per dozen, down from $5 in January. Further drops in inflation may provide a reason for a rate cut, providing much-needed relief from what is called the cost-of-living crisis. This would ease up personal budgets so that people can buy more Bitcoin in preparation for uncertain times.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|REGULATION|ASIA,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-14 00:01:15
41616600,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=140012,1741910493,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Crypto Shift: US Treasury Eyes Bitcoin Custody with Crypto Firms!,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-treasury-bitcoin-custody/,"Is the U.S. Treasury making a bold move into the world of cryptocurrency? Recent reports suggest they are, and it could be a monumental shift for the digital asset landscape. Imagine the U.S. government holding a national Bitcoin reserve – sounds like something out of a futuristic financial thriller, right? But this might be closer to reality than you think. Let’s dive into the details of the U.S. Treasury’s exploration of Bitcoin custody with crypto firms and what it could mean for the future of finance. Why is the US Treasury Exploring Bitcoin Custody? According to a report by Decrypt, the U.S. Treasury has engaged in discussions with several crypto firms , including Anchorage Digital, a prominent crypto custody provider. The core topic? Safeguarding a potential national Bitcoin reserve. This isn’t just a casual chat; it’s a serious exploration into how the government could securely manage and store Bitcoin on a large scale. Think about it – for a government accustomed to dealing with gold reserves and traditional financial instruments, venturing into the realm of digital assets like Bitcoin is a significant leap. So, why are they considering this? Diversification and Modernization: Nations are constantly looking to diversify their reserves and stay ahead of the curve in global finance. Bitcoin, as a growing and increasingly recognized digital asset, could be seen as a modern addition to traditional reserves. Strategic Foresight: Governments need to plan for the future. Recognizing the growing importance of cryptocurrencies, exploring Bitcoin custody now could be a proactive step towards understanding and potentially utilizing digital assets in the future. Understanding Market Dynamics: By engaging with crypto firms and exploring custody solutions, the U.S. Treasury gains valuable insights into the workings of the crypto market, its infrastructure, and the technological underpinnings of digital assets. Anchorage Digital at the Forefront of Bitcoin Custody Discussions Anchorage Digital, a well-known name in the digital asset custody space, played a central role in these discussions. CEO Nathan McCauley reportedly shared insights with Treasury officials on best practices for Bitcoin custody . This highlights the government’s interest in leveraging the expertise of established crypto firms to navigate the complexities of digital asset storage and security. What kind of expertise are we talking about? Area of Expertise Relevance to Bitcoin Custody Secure Key Management Crucial for protecting private keys that control access to Bitcoin holdings. Firms like Anchorage specialize in multi-signature and institutional-grade security protocols. Regulatory Compliance Navigating the complex and evolving regulatory landscape of cryptocurrencies is essential. Custody firms are experienced in adhering to KYC/AML requirements and security standards. Operational Security Ensuring the continuous and secure operation of custody infrastructure, including protection against cyber threats and internal risks. Scalability and Infrastructure Handling potentially large volumes of Bitcoin and managing the infrastructure required for secure storage and transaction processing. National Bitcoin Reserve: A Question of When, Not If? The idea of a national Bitcoin reserve is no longer a fringe concept. While the U.S. Treasury is still in the evaluation phase, the very fact that they are engaging in these discussions signals a significant shift in perspective. Several industry leaders are suggesting third-party custody as a viable interim solution. This would allow the government to dip its toes into Bitcoin without immediately building out a complete in-house custody infrastructure. The long-term vision, however, might involve self-custody, granting the government complete control over its digital assets. Third-Party Custody vs. Self-Custody: What’s the Difference? Third-Party Custody: Entrusting a specialized firm like Anchorage Digital to hold and secure the Bitcoin on behalf of the government. This offers immediate access to expertise and established infrastructure but involves reliance on an external entity. Self-Custody: The government takes full responsibility for managing and securing its own Bitcoin holdings, potentially using government agencies or creating new departments for this purpose. This provides maximum control but requires significant investment in technology, security, and expertise. The choice between these two models will depend on various factors, including security considerations, regulatory frameworks, and the government’s long-term strategy for digital asset management. Impact on Stablecoins and Market Structure The Treasury’s exploration of Bitcoin custody isn’t just about Bitcoin itself. The discussions also touched upon the potential impacts on stablecoins and the broader market structure. This is crucial because any significant move by the U.S. government into the crypto space can have ripple effects across the entire ecosystem. Here’s how it could impact stablecoins and market structure: Increased Legitimacy for Crypto: Government involvement, even in an exploratory phase, can lend further legitimacy to the cryptocurrency market as a whole, potentially boosting investor confidence. Regulatory Clarity: As the government delves deeper into digital asset custody , it may lead to clearer regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies, which is something the industry has been eagerly anticipating. Market Stability: A well-managed national Bitcoin reserve could potentially contribute to market stability in the long run, especially if it encourages responsible adoption and reduces market volatility. Stablecoin Scrutiny: The discussions likely involve examining how stablecoins fit into the broader picture and how they might be affected by government involvement in digital assets. This could lead to further regulatory scrutiny or even integration of stablecoins within the traditional financial system. What are the Challenges Ahead? While the prospect of a national Bitcoin reserve is exciting, there are significant challenges to overcome: Security Risks: Securing vast amounts of Bitcoin against hacking, theft, and other cyber threats is paramount. Government-level security requires robust, cutting-edge solutions. Regulatory Hurdles: Existing regulations may not be fully equipped to handle government-held digital asset reserves. New frameworks might be needed to ensure compliance and transparency. Market Volatility: Bitcoin’s price volatility remains a concern. Managing a reserve in a highly volatile market requires careful strategies and risk management. Public Perception: Public and political perception of cryptocurrencies can be mixed. Gaining broad support for a national Bitcoin reserve may require public education and addressing concerns about risk and volatility. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? This development, while still in its early stages, carries significant implications for the crypto community and beyond: Increased Institutional Adoption: The U.S. Treasury’s interest signals a growing acceptance of Bitcoin at the highest levels of government, potentially paving the way for wider institutional adoption. Positive Market Sentiment: News of government exploration into Bitcoin custody can boost market sentiment and attract more investors to the crypto space. Focus on Security and Regulation: The emphasis on Bitcoin custody highlights the critical importance of security and regulatory compliance in the crypto industry. Firms and individuals alike should prioritize these aspects. Future of Finance: This is a strong indicator that digital assets are becoming an integral part of the future financial landscape. Staying informed and adapting to these changes is crucial for anyone involved in finance or technology. Conclusion: A Monumental Step Towards Crypto Integration? The U.S. Treasury exploring Bitcoin custody with crypto firms is more than just a news headline; it’s a potential watershed moment. It suggests a growing recognition of Bitcoin and digital assets as legitimate components of the global financial system. While the journey to a national Bitcoin reserve is still in its early stages and fraught with challenges, the fact that these discussions are happening at the highest levels of government is undeniably significant. This could be the first step towards a future where digital assets are not just a niche market, but a fundamental part of national and global financial strategies.

Singapore-regulated DigiFT, a pioneer in tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), has just announced a groundbreaking launch. They’ve brought Invesco’s private credit token, iSNR, onto the Arbitrum network. This move is a significant leap forward for RWA tokenization, promising to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning DeFi ecosystem. Let’s dive into what this means for you and the future of finance. Unveiling Invesco’s Private Credit Token on Arbitrum: A DeFi Game Changer So, what exactly happened? DigiFT, recognized for its regulated decentralized exchange (DEX) focused on RWAs, has listed Invesco’s iSNR token on Arbitrum. This token is designed to mirror the performance of Invesco’s impressive $6.3 billion U.S. Senior Loan Strategy. What makes this launch truly noteworthy is its potential to inject institutional-grade private credit into the DeFi space. Think about it – access to traditionally exclusive investment strategies now available within the transparent and accessible world of DeFi. This is not just incremental progress; it’s a potentially transformative shift. Here’s a quick breakdown of the key components: DigiFT: A Singapore-regulated DEX specializing in tokenizing real-world assets. Invesco iSNR Token: A token tracking Invesco’s U.S. Senior Loan Strategy, representing private credit exposure. Arbitrum: A leading Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, known for its speed and lower transaction costs. RWA Tokenization: The process of representing real-world assets, like private credit, as digital tokens on a blockchain. DeFi Expansion: This launch expands the scope of DeFi beyond cryptocurrencies to include traditional financial instruments. Why is RWA Tokenization Gaining Momentum in DeFi? RWA tokenization is rapidly becoming a hot topic in the crypto space, and for good reason. It’s about bringing real-world assets – think everything from real estate and commodities to private credit and art – onto the blockchain. Why is this important? Because it unlocks a whole new realm of possibilities for DeFi. Let’s explore the benefits: Increased Liquidity: Tokenizing RWAs can make traditionally illiquid assets more easily tradable and accessible. Imagine fractional ownership of fine art or real estate, easily bought and sold on a DEX. Enhanced Accessibility: DeFi aims to democratize finance. RWA tokenization extends this by offering access to investment opportunities previously limited to institutional investors or high-net-worth individuals. Greater Transparency and Efficiency: Blockchain technology inherently offers transparency and efficiency. Tokenizing RWAs leverages these benefits, streamlining processes and reducing intermediaries. Portfolio Diversification: RWAs can offer diversification benefits to crypto-native portfolios, potentially reducing volatility and enhancing risk-adjusted returns. Yield Opportunities: RWAs can bring real-world yield into DeFi. In the case of Invesco’s iSNR token, it provides exposure to private credit, a traditionally yield-generating asset class. DigiFT and Invesco on Arbitrum: How Does it Work? The collaboration between DigiFT and Invesco, leveraging the Arbitrum network, is a masterclass in strategic partnerships. DigiFT, with its regulatory compliance, provides the platform for tokenization and trading. Invesco, a global investment management giant, brings the institutional-grade asset – private credit. And Arbitrum, a leading Layer-2 solution, offers the scalability and cost-effectiveness needed for DeFi applications. Here’s a closer look at how it works: Token Creation: DigiFT tokenizes Invesco’s U.S. Senior Loan Strategy, creating the iSNR token. This token represents a claim on the underlying private credit assets. Listing on DigiFT DEX: The iSNR token is listed on DigiFT’s regulated DEX, making it available for trading. Arbitrum Integration: By launching on Arbitrum, DigiFT ensures faster transactions and lower gas fees compared to transacting directly on Ethereum mainnet. This is crucial for making RWA trading practical and accessible. Stablecoin Purchases: The iSNR token can be purchased using USDC and USDT, two of the most widely used stablecoins in the crypto ecosystem. This simplifies the entry point for users familiar with DeFi. Regulatory Compliance: DigiFT’s regulatory framework ensures a level of investor protection and operational integrity often lacking in the less regulated corners of DeFi. Why Arbitrum is the Ideal Choice for RWA Expansion in DeFi Arbitrum has emerged as a preferred Layer-2 solution for many DeFi projects, and its selection by DigiFT for this RWA initiative is no coincidence. Arbitrum’s architecture is specifically designed to address the scalability challenges of Ethereum, making it an ideal platform for applications requiring high transaction throughput and low fees, which are essential for the widespread adoption of DeFi and particularly for trading tokenized assets. Key advantages of Arbitrum for RWA tokenization include: Scalability: Arbitrum significantly increases transaction speed and reduces congestion compared to Ethereum mainnet, making trading RWAs more efficient. Low Transaction Fees: Lower gas fees on Arbitrum make frequent trading and smaller transactions economically viable, opening up RWA access to a broader range of users. Ethereum Compatibility: Arbitrum is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), making it easy for developers to port existing Ethereum-based projects and for users to interact with Arbitrum using familiar tools and wallets. Security: While being a Layer-2 solution, Arbitrum inherits the security of the underlying Ethereum network, providing a robust and secure environment for DeFi activities. Growing Ecosystem: Arbitrum boasts a rapidly expanding ecosystem of DeFi protocols, tools, and users, creating a vibrant and interconnected environment for RWA initiatives to thrive. The Vision: Bridging Regulated Onchain Credit and DeFi DigiFT CEO Henry Zhang’s statement, as reported by Cointelegraph, perfectly encapsulates the vision behind this launch. He emphasized the role of the iSNR token in “integrating regulated onchain credit with DeFi and institutional investors.” This highlights the core objective: to create a bridge between the regulated world of traditional finance and the permissionless innovation of DeFi . This integration is crucial for several reasons: Institutional Adoption: Bringing regulated, institutional-grade assets into DeFi can attract larger institutional investors who are currently hesitant due to regulatory uncertainties and lack of traditional financial instruments. Mainstream Adoption: By offering familiar asset classes like private credit in a DeFi format, it can make DeFi more appealing and accessible to a wider audience beyond crypto natives. Ecosystem Maturation: The inclusion of RWAs contributes to the maturation and diversification of the DeFi ecosystem, making it more robust and less reliant solely on volatile crypto assets. Real-World Impact: Tokenizing RWAs can ultimately channel capital from the crypto space into real-world projects and businesses, fostering innovation and economic growth beyond the digital realm. Navigating the Challenges and Looking Ahead for RWA in DeFi While the launch of Invesco’s private credit token on Arbitrum is a significant milestone, the journey of RWA tokenization in DeFi is still in its early stages. There are challenges to overcome and developments to watch out for. Some key challenges include: Regulatory Clarity: The regulatory landscape for RWAs in DeFi is still evolving. Clear and consistent regulations are needed to foster growth and ensure investor protection. Custody and Security: Secure and compliant custody solutions for RWAs are essential. Ensuring the security of underlying assets and the integrity of tokenized representations is paramount. Valuation and Transparency: Establishing reliable valuation mechanisms and ensuring transparency for RWAs can be complex, especially for assets that are not easily priced in public markets. Interoperability: Seamless interoperability between different DeFi platforms and traditional financial systems is crucial for the widespread adoption of RWAs. Education and Adoption: Educating both traditional finance participants and crypto users about the benefits and risks of RWA tokenization is vital for driving adoption. Despite these challenges, the momentum behind RWA tokenization is undeniable. The DigiFT and Invesco collaboration is a powerful example of how traditional finance and DeFi can converge to create new opportunities and reshape the financial landscape. As the DeFi space continues to mature and regulatory frameworks become clearer, we can expect to see even more innovative RWA initiatives emerge, further blurring the lines between the digital and physical worlds of finance. Conclusion: A Transformative Step for DeFi and Beyond DigiFT’s launch of Invesco’s private credit token on Arbitrum is more than just another token listing. It represents a significant step towards realizing the full potential of DeFi by integrating real-world assets. This move not only expands investment options within DeFi but also paves the way for greater institutional participation and mainstream adoption. By leveraging Arbitrum’s scalability and DigiFT’s regulatory compliance, this initiative sets a new precedent for how traditional finance and decentralized technologies can work together to create a more accessible, efficient, and diversified financial future. The revolution of private credit in DeFi is just beginning, and DigiFT is at the forefront, leading the charge.

Zhao Denies Allegations as Warren Criticizes Trump’s Crypto Ties Zhao responded on X after the article’s publication, stating that the report “got the facts wrong.” CZ refutes WSJ’s allegations, stating he never discussed a Binance US deal in exchange for a pardon. #Crypto #BinanceUS https://t.co/3QA8ermJWg — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 13, 2025 “I have had no discussions of a Binance US deal with … well, anyone,” Zhao said in a March 13 X post . “Feels like the article is motivated as an attack on the President and crypto, and the residual forces of the ‘war on crypto’ from the last administration are still at work,” he continued. “I am always happy to make crypto great everywhere, US and the rest of the world.” Trump, who has positioned himself as supportive of the crypto industry in his 2024 campaign, has drawn mixed reactions for his ties to the sector. During a Senate Banking Committee hearing on March 13, Senator Elizabeth Warren criticized World Liberty Financial after a Bloomberg report revealed its discussions with Binance. Bloomberg just broke news that the Trump family’s crypto company has been in discussions with Binance on doing business, including possibly creating a new stablecoin. We have a chance to fix this stablecoin bill to prevent this kind of naked corruption. pic.twitter.com/NdQH4RHnl3 — Senate Banking and Housing Democrats (@SenateBanking) March 13, 2025 “Bloomberg has just broken the news that the Trump family’s crypto company has been in discussions on doing business, including possibly creating a new stablecoin – exactly what we’re debating right now,” Warren said. “For those of you who don’t remember, Binance pleaded guilty to criminal charges for ‘willful failures that allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform,” the Democratic lawmaker continued. “We should be standing up to this kind of naked corruption not trying to figure out how to build some kind of super highway so it can take off even faster, bigger, and better,” she continued. Regulatory Crossroads: Politics Meets Cryptocurrency The alleged talks between the Trump family and Binance.US represent more than just a business negotiation—they symbolize the complex intersection of politics, regulation, and digital finance. As cryptocurrency increasingly becomes a partisan battlefield, with Republicans championing industry growth and Democrats like Warren raising alarm bells about potential misconduct, the future of digital asset policy hangs in balance. The advancement of the GENIUS Act signals a potential shift in stablecoin regulation despite vocal opposition. Whether these developments lead to meaningful oversight or regulatory capture will depend largely on which voices ultimately shape policy. For investors and industry participants, these political dynamics may prove just as consequential as market movements in determining crypto’s American future . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How do these talks reflect the mix of politics and digital finance? These discussions reveal how political ties and crypto business converge, fueling debates on market oversight and ethics. The potential shift in focus may reshape how the public views digital finance. Could these interactions influence future crypto regulations?

What broader effects might arise from political influence in crypto deals? A3: These engagements may blur the lines between political involvement and market decisions, prompting closer review of financial ties. Experts warn that thorough review is key to keeping digital finance fair.

The Hoodi testnet will launch on March 17 and the Pectra upgrade for it will be activated on March 26, Ethereum Foundation developer Tim Beiko said following the Ethereum All Core Dev Call on March 13. If Pectra runs smoothly on Hoodi without major issues, core developers could set a mainnet launch date for Pectra as soon as 30 days after Hoodi’s activation, Beiko said. That would mean Pectra could go live on Ethereum mainnet as early as April 25. Tim Beiko’s latest announcement on the Pectra upgrade: Ethereum Magicians Pectra, which combines features from the Prague and Electra proposals, will implement over 10 Ethereum Improvement Proposals mostly aimed at bringing more functionality to Ethereum wallets and improving user experience. It will also include scaling proposals to double the blob count for data availability from three to six. Pectra was initially slated to launch on Ethereum mainnet in late 2024 but has faced repeated delays due to client readiness issues and synchronization bugs in the first two Ethereum testnets, Holesky and Sepolia. Pectra was rolled out on Sepolia on March 5, but soon after, Ethereum developers started seeing error messages on their geth nodes and empty blocks being mined. Galaxy Digital vice president of research Christine Kim said Hoodi would look to “mimic” the Ethereum mainnet as closely as possible by launching a validator set similar to how mainnet currently operates. That would see at least 20 million test staked-Ether ( ETH ) distributed across 11 client teams and five staking operators. Source: Christine Kim Beiko noted that aspects of Pectra may still be tested on Sepolia and Holesky. Related: Ethereum average gas fees drop 95% one year after the Dencun upgrade The third testnet comes as Ethereum core developers agreed to deploy future Ethereum protocol upgrades at a faster cadence during an “All Core Devs” meeting on Feb. 13.

The world of tokenized assets just witnessed a monumental leap forward. BlackRock, the undisputed titan of asset management, is making serious waves in the digital realm. Their tokenized fund, BUIDL, has absolutely exploded in growth, smashing through the $1 billion mark in assets under management (AUM). This incredible surge comes hot on the heels of a massive $200 million investment from crypto protocol innovator, Ethena. Let’s dive deep into what this sensational development signifies for the future of finance and the ever-evolving landscape of digital asset markets. BlackRock BUIDL: A Tokenized Fund Revolution So, what exactly is BlackRock BUIDL and why is this milestone such a big deal? BUIDL isn’t your average investment fund. It’s a tokenized fund, meaning it represents ownership of traditional assets – in this case, U.S. Treasuries – on a blockchain. Think of it as bridging the gap between the traditional financial world and the cutting-edge world of crypto. This innovative approach offers a multitude of benefits, making it an attractive proposition for investors seeking exposure to digital asset markets. Transparency and Efficiency: Blockchain technology inherently provides transparency. Every transaction and holding within the BUIDL fund is recorded on a public ledger, offering unprecedented visibility. This also streamlines processes, potentially reducing administrative overhead and improving efficiency compared to traditional funds. Accessibility and Fractional Ownership: Tokenization allows for fractional ownership. Investors can access a portion of high-quality assets like U.S. Treasuries with smaller investment amounts than typically required in traditional markets. This democratizes access and opens up new avenues for participation in sophisticated financial instruments. Instant Settlement and 24/7 Trading Potential: While not fully realized yet, tokenized assets have the potential for near-instant settlement and 24/7 trading. This contrasts sharply with the slower settlement times and limited trading hours of traditional financial markets, offering greater flexibility and liquidity. Ethena’s $200 Million Crypto Investment: Fueling the Fire The catalyst for BUIDL’s meteoric rise to over $1 billion AUM? A substantial $200 million crypto investment from Ethena, a protocol known for its innovative approach to stablecoins and synthetic dollars. Ethena’s strategic move highlights the growing confidence within the crypto space in tokenized real-world assets. This injection of capital not only boosted BUIDL’s asset base but also signaled a significant endorsement from a key player in the digital asset markets. Why did Ethena choose to invest such a large sum? It’s likely a multifaceted decision driven by: Yield Opportunities: BUIDL, backed by U.S. Treasuries, offers a yield that can be attractive in the current low-interest-rate environment. For crypto protocols like Ethena, seeking stable and potentially higher yield-generating avenues for their reserves, BUIDL presents a compelling option. Collateral Utility: As the article mentions, BUIDL is being used as collateral in various digital asset markets. This utility is crucial for the DeFi (Decentralized Finance) ecosystem. Ethena’s investment could be partly driven by the desire to utilize BUIDL as collateral within their own or partner platforms. Strategic Alignment: Both BlackRock and Ethena are pushing the boundaries of traditional finance and crypto. Ethena’s investment could be seen as a strategic alignment with BlackRock’s foray into tokenization, further legitimizing and accelerating the adoption of these technologies. Tokenized Fund Integration: Reshaping Digital Asset Markets The fact that BUIDL is being actively used as collateral underscores the increasing integration of tokenized financial instruments into the broader digital asset markets. This is not just about hype; it’s about tangible utility and real-world application. Tokenized funds like BUIDL are starting to play a critical role in: Area Impact of Tokenized Funds DeFi Lending & Borrowing Provides high-quality, liquid collateral options, reducing risk and enhancing stability in DeFi protocols. Stablecoin Ecosystem Offers diversification and yield opportunities for stablecoin reserves, potentially improving the resilience of the stablecoin market. Institutional Adoption Facilitates institutional participation in digital assets by offering familiar structures (funds) with exposure to blockchain technology. Cross-Chain Interoperability Tokenized assets can potentially bridge different blockchain ecosystems, fostering greater connectivity and capital flow. Challenges and the Path Forward for Crypto Investment While the $1 billion milestone for BUIDL is undeniably exciting, it’s important to acknowledge that the journey of tokenized funds and crypto investment is not without its challenges. Some key hurdles include: Regulatory Clarity: The regulatory landscape for tokenized assets is still evolving globally. Clear and consistent regulations are crucial for fostering wider adoption and ensuring investor protection. Interoperability Standards: Lack of standardized protocols for tokenized assets across different blockchains can hinder seamless integration and interoperability. Custody and Security: Secure custody solutions for tokenized assets, especially at institutional scale, are paramount. Ensuring the safety and integrity of these digital holdings is critical. Education and Awareness: Broader education and awareness are needed to demystify tokenization and its benefits for both institutional and retail investors. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? So, what are the key takeaways from this explosive growth of BlackRock’s BUIDL and Ethena’s crypto investment? Here are some actionable insights: Keep an Eye on Tokenization: Tokenization is not just a buzzword; it’s a fundamental shift in how assets can be represented and traded. Understanding this trend is crucial for navigating the future of finance. Explore Digital Asset Markets: Even if you’re a traditional investor, the lines between traditional and digital finance are blurring. Consider exploring the potential of digital asset markets and the role tokenized assets are playing. Stay Informed on Regulatory Developments: The regulatory environment will significantly impact the growth trajectory of tokenized assets. Staying informed about regulatory changes is essential for making informed investment decisions. Due Diligence is Key: As with any investment, thorough due diligence is paramount in the crypto space. Understand the risks and rewards before investing in tokenized funds or other digital assets. A Billion-Dollar Beginning: The Future is Tokenized BlackRock’s BUIDL surpassing $1 billion in AUM is more than just a number; it’s a powerful signal. It signifies the growing acceptance and adoption of tokenized assets by major financial institutions and crypto-native protocols alike. Ethena’s substantial crypto investment is a testament to the potential and utility of BUIDL and tokenized funds in general. While challenges remain, this milestone marks a significant step towards a future where finance is increasingly digital, transparent, and accessible, powered by the transformative potential of blockchain technology. The tokenization revolution is gaining momentum, and the journey has just begun.

The purchase was executed through two transactions on March 13, 2025, via the crypto exchange Coinbase. This is in line with the firm’s ongoing plan of holding a major position in digital assets as it expresses confidence in Bitcoin. Ark Invest Acquires 997 BTC Through Coinbase According to data from Arkham Intelligence , Ark Invest acquired 997 BTC worth $80 million from Coinbase on March 13, 2025. The transaction was split into two parts: the first purchase included 498 BTC, while the second, completed four hours later, added 499 BTC. The acquisition occurs at a time when Ark Invest is seeking to increase its Bet on Bitcoin. Currently, institutional investors remain very active holders of cryptocurrencies and a large number are invested in Bitcoin ETFs. The most recent acquisition shows that the firm is willing to remain in the digital asset sector regardless of the price swings. However, apart from this latest BTC purchase, Ark Investment has sold roughly $9 million of its BTC ETFs invested in the company. This sentiment is in line with other institutions selling, as $1.1 billion exited spot Bitcoin ETF. The reason for this can be attributed to a declining performance of the US stock market, inflation concerns, and uncertainties in trade policies. Ark Invest Rebalances Portfolio In addition to acquiring Bitcoin, Ark Invest recently increased its Coinbase (COIN) stock holdings. The firm purchased 64,358 shares of Coinbase, valued at approximately $11.53 million. This marks its largest investment in Coinbase stock since August 2024. Unlike previous portfolio adjustments, Ark Invest did not sell its spot Bitcoin ETF holdings. The firm’s decision to retain Bitcoin while expanding its Coinbase stock holdings suggests a strategic shift in its investment approach. Analysts view this move as part of Ark Invest’s long-term strategy in the digital asset sector. Bitcoin Price Action Amid Institutional Interest In recent weeks, Bitcoin price shifted due to institutional buying and selling together with other factors in the crypto market. Ironically, BTC has remained an essential commodity for long-term investors who keep amassing. More so, Cathie Wood remains a supporter of Bitcoin. Cathie previously forecasted an increase in BTC price to $1 million per coin by 2030. Nevertheless, Bitcoin’s strength has diminished due to the trading war impact, which makes the asset still bearish. Bitcoin price traded in the $79,000 range before rising back to the $81,000 mark, but faced resistance at the $83,700 level. In case, the selling pressure continues, BTC price may further decline towards the $75,000 Support level.

They introduced 6 repositories, that would appeal to crypto developers, and added malware, to create backdoors, infiltrate projects, and steal credentials. The hacking group would use BeaverTail, a malware package, to execute a hidden file on the target system. The malware would then steal credentials by accessing browser files and searching for files related to cryptocurrency wallets like Exodus. The stolen data would then be sent to a command and control centre so that the hackers could readily access the sensitive files. “Attributing this attack”, wrote Kirill Boychenko, Socket Seniority Analyst, “definitively to Lazarus or a sophisticated copycat remains challenging, as absolute attribution is inherently difficult. However, the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) observed in this npm attack closely align with Lazarus’s known operations, extensively documented by researchers from Unit42, eSentire, DataDog, Phylum, and others since 2022”. The NPM repositories were based on actual libraries, but used typosquatting and similar spelling to mimic popular packages and trick developers into installing them. The malicious packages were downloaded over 300 times, showing the reach of the attack. The six malicious packages include: is-buffer-validator – mimics is-buffer library, steals credentials. yoojae-validator – fake validator, steals sensitive data. event-handle-package – pretends to be an event handling tool, but installs a back door for remote access. array-empty-validator – collects browser and system credentials. react-event-dependency – pretends to be a react utility, but compromises developer environments. auth-validator – steals login and API credentials. “The APT group”, wrote Boychenko, “created and maintained GitHub repositories for five of the malicious packages, lending an appearance of open source legitimacy and increasing the likelihood of the harmful code being integrated into developer workflows”. The malware was designed to collect system information, such as operating system, system directories, and hostname, deploying this attack to hundreds of NPM users. “It systematically iterates through browser profiles”, wrote Boychenko, “to locate and extract sensitive files such as Login Data from Chrome, Brave, and Firefox, as well as keychain archives on macOS. Notably, the malware also targets cryptocurrency wallets, specifically extracting id.json from Solana and exodus.wallet from Exodus”. This attack is part of Lazarus Group’s broader strategy to disrupt supply chains. The NPM malware allows them to target developers, a vital part of the global supply chain, and embed themselves inside systems, development environments, and crypto addresses to further their attacks. Similar methods have been used to target GitHub and Python’s pip packages. “Continuous monitoring of unusual dependency changes”, wrote Boychenko, “can expose malicious updates while blocking outbound connections to known C2 endpoints prevents data exfiltration. Sandboxing untrusted code in controlled environments and deploying endpoint protection can detect suspicious file system or network activities”. Boychenko raises a critical point because developers, due to tight deadlines, often use many libraries without fully checking them. Cryptocurrency, being decentralized, allows developers to collaborate over vast distances, but also increases the attack vector of open source projects. According to the United Nations 2024 report, North Korean hackers were responsible for 35% of cryptocurrency thefts, amounting to $1 billion in lost crypto. The hackers pose a new kind of security threat, being state actors, because they may use their accumulated wealth to fund nuclear weapons programs and ballistic missile enhancements.",Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News|North Korea,EN,0,0,APT|ASIA|SOL,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-14 00:29:29

Gox Transfers. Glassnodes’s accumulation trend score shows shifts in investor sentiment and increased selling pressure. Mt. Gox transfers are affecting markets but are overshadowed by tariff concerns. Bitcoin’s ( BTC-USD ) rollercoaster ride continues as President Donald Trump and his tariff policies ramp up and weigh on overall market sentiment. The bitcoin price has been flirting with the $80,000 per bitcoin handle, dragging down the wider crypto market that’s now erased $1 trillion of value in just a month. The hype around President Trump and his pro-crypto policies have faded as the effects of a global trade war take hold of financial markets. The tariff proposals by President Trump have for now cast a shadow over markets with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink stating that if people become more focused on supporting their own country, often referred to as nationalism, it could lead to higher inflation. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, as some might find it appealing, but it would likely have an impact on prices. Fears of a recession have also ramped up and thus weighing on crypto markets. Goldman Sachs economists have increased the chances of a recession in the next year from 15% to 20%. They pointed to Trump’s economic policies as the main concern. Yardeni Research economists also raised their recession estimate, from 20% to 35%, blaming Trump’s rapid actions with executive orders, firings, and tariffs. Crypto Heatmap, March 13, 2025 Source: TradingView Was Mt. Gox Responsible for the Recent Selloff? According to Lookonchain, Mt. Gox moved 11,834 bitcoins this month, including 11,502 to an unknown wallet. A recent transfer of $1.07 billion in March, followed by a complex repayment process starting in July 2023 and ending on October 31, has raised questions. Why now? The timing may be tied to the legal details of creditor repayments. Every action from Mt. Gox still rattles the crypto world, even years after its 2014 bankruptcy. The platform still holds significant influence over the market. However, so far, no large sell-offs have followed these repayments. Creditors, many of whom are experienced “hodlers,” appear to take a cautious approach rather than panicking. The extension of the repayment deadline to October 2024, announced at the end of 2023, has brought some relief. But the market operates on fear and instinct, and Mt. Gox continues to stir uncertainty. Fear, after all, often builds on itself. Some bitcoins were moved to a hot wallet, which is often used for quick access to funds and could suggest a future sale. However, most of the bitcoins ended up in a “new wallet,” likely as a temporary step before being distributed further. This seems to be a cautious approach rather than an aggressive one. Still, the market tends to overreact, treating every unknown wallet as a potential threat and every transaction as a warning sign. Thus, the question is whether this was the reason for the selloff in crypto markets. While I believe this played a part, the ongoing pressure on Bitcoin prices is more indicative of fear across markets rather than a Mt.Gox situation. Looking back at the market’s reaction during previous Mt. Gox moves, and it is clear that the moves did not have a long-lasting impact on crypto prices. The current decline and lack of a sustainable recovery suggest a different dynamic this time around. Glassnode – The Week On-Chain Bitcoin’s price cycles move between phases of buying (accumulation) and selling (distribution), with money shifting between different groups of investors over time. The Accumulation Trend Score measures these changes, with scores near 1 (dark purple) showing strong buying activity and scores near 0 (yellow) showing selling activity. The chart shows that after periods of heavy accumulation, selling phases often follow, leading to weaker price movements. The most recent selling phase started in January 2025, matching Bitcoin’s drop from $108,000 to $93,000. Right now, the Accumulation Trend Score is below 0.1, indicating ongoing strong selling pressure. Source: Glassnode The Accumulation Trend Score tracks how total Bitcoin balances on the blockchain are changing. However, it is influenced more by the actions of big players and doesn’t show where the Bitcoin was bought. While it’s useful for spotting general buying or selling trends, it doesn’t provide detailed information about key price levels where Bitcoin was acquired. The cost-basis of Short-Term Holders ((STH)) shows that market momentum has turned negative, with less demand and growing uncertainty among investors. Signs of fear-driven selling are clear, as the STH-SOPR (a measure showing profit or loss for short-term sellers) stays below 1, meaning most are selling at a loss. At the same time, STH-CDD (a measure of recent-holder activity) has jumped, showing more selling by short-term investors. This wave of selling matches the market trading near its lower range. Many recent buyers are likely feeling significant financial pressure during this time. All of the above does not currently inspire confidence for a sustained bullish move. The biggest takeaway and something which we are seeing in US Equity markets is the lack of dip-buying this time around. Not a surprise as markets are currently in a phase of capital preservation and risk aversion with no end in sight given the pending universal tariffs being proposed by the Trump administration. It looks like a bumpy road ahead, so strap in and enjoy the ride. Technical Analysis – BTC/USD Bitcoin from a technical standpoint on the daily timeframe remains in a bearish trend. A daily candle close above the 90000 handle will be needed for a change in structure and this remains some distance away at present. Today it was the 200-day MA which served as a significant area of resistance and capped yesterday's attempted rally to the upside as well. The decline today, found support at the 80000 handle with a brief foray below being met with some buying pressure. However, the daily candle closed as a bearish engulfing candle, which hints at further downside ahead. Looking at the potential of a break to the downside, and we have support at the 78197 handle before the 75000 handle comes into focus. Below the 75000 mark, the swing high from October 2024 at 73777 may be a key area to keep an eye on. A move higher from current prices may find resistance at 82133 and the 200-day MA at 83636. Next focus will shift to the 85000 handle and the 90000 handle respectively.

If you’re using a Trezor Safe 3 hardware wallet, you need to pay close attention. A recent disclosure from Trezor has sent ripples through the crypto community, highlighting a potential vulnerability in their latest device. But before you panic and start moving your funds, let’s break down exactly what’s happening, what it means for you, and most importantly, how to stay secure. This isn’t just another news flash; it’s a crucial update that could impact your digital asset security. What is the Trezor Safe 3 Vulnerability? Unpacking the Voltage Glitching Threat The buzz is all about a potential weakness in the Trezor Safe 3, uncovered by security experts at Ledger Donjon – yes, you read that right, Ledger, a competitor, identified this. This isn’t your everyday software bug; it’s a hardware-level concern involving something called voltage glitching . But what exactly is voltage glitching, and why should you care? In simple terms, voltage glitching is a sophisticated attack method where hackers manipulate the voltage supplied to a device’s chip. By causing brief voltage fluctuations at just the right moment, attackers can disrupt the normal operation of the chip and potentially bypass security measures. In the case of the Trezor Safe 3, this could theoretically be used to extract your crypto private keys . Here’s a breakdown of what we know: The Vulnerability: Voltage glitching attack on Trezor Safe 3. The Discoverer: Ledger Donjon security researchers. The Risk: Potential exposure of private keys if an attacker gains physical access to your device. Affected Model: Specifically Trezor Safe 3. Older models like Model One, Model T, and the newer Safe 5 are reportedly not affected. It’s important to understand that this isn’t a remote exploit. An attacker would need physical possession of your Trezor Safe 3 to even attempt this. However, the fact that such a method exists is definitely something to be aware of. Hardware Wallet Security: Why is This News Important? Hardware wallets like Trezor are designed to be fortresses for your crypto. They keep your private keys offline, away from the prying eyes of online hackers. This is why they are considered the gold standard for hardware wallet security and safeguarding your digital assets. When a potential vulnerability surfaces, even if it requires physical access, it’s a big deal. It reminds us that no system is completely impenetrable, and constant vigilance is key. Why is this vulnerability noteworthy? Highlights the Complexity of Hardware Security: Even with robust security measures, hardware can have vulnerabilities. Emphasizes the Need for Continuous Scrutiny: Security research, even from competitors, plays a vital role in making crypto safer. Reinforces Best Practices: This incident underscores the importance of physical security and using additional security features like passphrases and strong PINs. Think of your hardware wallet as a physical safe for your crypto. While incredibly secure, it’s not invincible. Just like a physical safe can be cracked by a determined thief with the right tools and time, hardware wallets can also be targeted with sophisticated hardware attacks. Crypto Private Keys: The Heart of Your Digital Assets at Risk? Your crypto private keys are essentially the master passwords to your cryptocurrency holdings. They allow you to authorize transactions and control your funds. If these keys are compromised, you could lose access to your crypto. This is why hardware wallets are designed to keep these keys ultra-secure, generating and storing them offline, within the device itself. The potential voltage glitching attack on the Trezor Safe 3 raises concerns because it could, in theory, allow an attacker to extract these critical private keys. Imagine someone getting the keys to your digital kingdom – that’s the level of risk we’re talking about. Key takeaways about private keys and this vulnerability: Private Keys are Paramount: Protect them at all costs. Hardware Wallets Enhance Security: They are still the most secure way to store private keys. Vulnerability is Potential, Not Guaranteed: Exploiting voltage glitching is complex and requires specialized skills and equipment. Trezor’s Response is Crucial: How Trezor addresses this will be key to maintaining user trust. Ledger Donjon’s Discovery: A Competitor Helping the Community? It might seem surprising that Ledger Donjon , the security research team from Trezor’s main competitor Ledger, is the one who discovered and reported this vulnerability. However, in the world of crypto security, collaboration and shared knowledge are often prioritized over competitive advantage. Finding and disclosing vulnerabilities benefits the entire crypto ecosystem. This act highlights a positive aspect of the crypto community: Community-Driven Security: Researchers from different companies contribute to overall security. Transparency and Disclosure: Openly reporting vulnerabilities helps users and manufacturers improve security. Ethical Hacking for Good: Ledger Donjon’s work exemplifies ethical hacking aimed at strengthening the crypto space. While Ledger and Trezor are competitors in the hardware wallet market, their shared interest in a secure crypto environment outweighs their rivalry in this instance. It’s a testament to the collaborative spirit within the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry when it comes to security. Actionable Insights: How to Protect Your Trezor Safe 3 (and Any Hardware Wallet) So, what should you do if you own a Trezor Safe 3? And what are some general best practices for hardware wallet security? Here are some actionable insights to bolster your crypto security: Purchase from Official Sources: Always buy your hardware wallet directly from the official Trezor website or authorized resellers. This minimizes the risk of receiving a tampered device. Use a Strong PIN: Set a strong and unique PIN for your Trezor Safe 3. Don’t use easily guessable numbers like birthdays or sequential digits. Enable a Passphrase: A passphrase adds an extra layer of security to your wallet. It’s like having a 25th word to your recovery seed phrase, making it significantly harder for anyone to access your funds even if they have your PIN and physical device. Physical Security is Key: Keep your Trezor Safe 3 in a secure location. Don’t leave it unattended in public places. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on updates from Trezor and the crypto security community. Be aware of potential threats and security recommendations. Consider Device Reseeding (If Concerned): While likely unnecessary for most users in this specific scenario given the physical access requirement for the exploit, for extreme caution, you could consider reseeding your wallet on a different device if you have significant concerns, then transferring back to your Safe 3 after ensuring you’ve taken all recommended security steps and Trezor’s official guidance. This is an advanced step and should be approached cautiously, ensuring you understand the process fully to avoid losing access to your funds. Trezor’s official advice is to purchase wallets from official sources and utilize passphrases and strong PINs – solid advice that every hardware wallet user should follow regardless of this specific vulnerability. Looking Ahead: Trezor’s Response and the Future of Hardware Wallets The crypto world is constantly evolving, and security threats are a persistent reality. The disclosure of this potential Trezor Safe 3 vulnerability serves as a valuable reminder of the ongoing need for vigilance and innovation in hardware wallet security. What happens next is crucial. We expect Trezor to: Acknowledge and Address: Trezor has already acknowledged the issue and is likely working on mitigation strategies. Provide Updates: Users will need clear communication and updates on the situation and any recommended actions. Enhance Security Measures: This incident will likely spur further research and development into hardware wallet security, potentially leading to even more robust defenses against physical attacks. Ultimately, hardware wallets remain the most secure way to store your crypto. This potential vulnerability, while concerning, doesn’t negate the fundamental security benefits they offer. It simply highlights that security is an ongoing process, and even the most trusted systems require constant scrutiny and improvement. In conclusion, while the news of a potential vulnerability in the Trezor Safe 3 is unsettling, it’s not a reason to abandon hardware wallets. Instead, it’s a call to action to reinforce best security practices, stay informed, and appreciate the ongoing efforts to make the crypto world a safer place. Keep your PINs strong, your passphrases secure, and always buy from official sources. Your crypto security is in your hands!

After a steady upward climb, buying momentum has weakened as sellers step in to defend this key level. A successful breakout could signal a continuation of the uptrend, driving XRP toward new highs and reinforcing positive sentiment in the market. However, if buyers fail to overcome this hurdle, XRP may face a pullback, with traders eyeing lower support levels for stability. Market participants are closely monitoring whether the bullish momentum is strong enough to push past the resistance or if selling pressure will force a temporary retreat. Market Sentiment And XRP’s Resistance Struggle Market sentiment remains a key factor in XRP’s ongoing battle against the $2.2546 resistance level. While bulls try to drive the price higher, the lack of strong follow-through suggests lingering uncertainty among traders. The resistance level has become a critical test, with buyers needing to sustain momentum to confirm a breakout. Related Reading: XRP Faces Bearish MVRV Crossover—Price Plunge To Continue? Broader market conditions, including Bitcoin’s movement and overall investor confidence, are influencing XRP’s price action. A surge in trading volume and renewed buying pressure could provide the necessary strength for a breakout. However, if sellers continue to defend this level, XRP may struggle to gain further ground, leading to potential profit-taking and a short-term pullback. Furthermore, after crossing above the 50% mark, the RSI is now dipping below it, creating uncertainty among traders. This shift reflects a tug-of-war between buyers and sellers, leaving XRP in a state of market indecision. Without a clear directional push, price movement could remain volatile as traders await stronger signals for the next move. For the bulls to regain control, market sentiment must shift decisively in their favor, with technical indicators aligning to support an upward push. Until then, XRP remains at a crossroads, with both breakout and rejection scenarios still in play. Breakout Potential: What Needs To Happen? For XRP to break above the $2.2546 resistance level, bulls must generate strong momentum backed by increasing buying pressure. A sustained push beyond this critical level, confirmed by a decisive daily close, might set the stage for further gains. Its ability to stabilize above $2.2546 may attract more traders looking to ride the breakout, potentially driving the price toward higher targets such as $2.6482 and $2.9272. Related Reading: XRP Faces Make-Or-Break Moment Amid Bearish Threat Also, XRP’s price must break above the 100-day SMA, and the RSI needs to rise above the 60% threshold. Breaking above these levels could pave the way for more growth, while failure to do so may leave XRP vulnerable to consolidation or a pullback.

A contentious effort to reform the blockchain network's generous inflation regime flopped on Thursday after supporters of SIMD-0228 failed to garner the supermajority they needed to implement the major economic change. The surprise result delivered a blow to the Solana power brokers who rallied to replace Solana's static inflation mechanics with a market-based system. Their proposal likely would have cut the network's 4.7% annual staking rewards down to 1% or less. In a contest that pitted Solana's influential leaders and investors – who claim the network's high staking rewards are bad for SOL's price – against small-time operators who feared the effects of a big cut to their revenue, the opposition rallied hardest on Thursday, as late-voting validators' ballots broke heavily in favor of ""no."" That was enough to scuttle the first major attempt at lowering Solana's uncommonly high staking emissions rate. Among the most valuable programmable blockchains by market cap, Solana issues comparatively large sums of new tokens to its validators, the computer operations that power proof-of-stake blockchains. Much like election night in the U.S., SIMD-0228's weeklong political circus featured betting, ranting, data threads, chart-reading wonkery, endless social media debates and more than a bit of heated name-calling. One validator put their votes up for sale. Many others split their tickets. It crescendoed with a dramatic rush of ballots cast by many of Solana's 1300 validators. In the end, the opposition won an exceptionally high turnout election that laid bare the divide between big and small validators. In the end, SIMD-0228 became the network's first economic reform to fail at the polls. Little stakers Solana validators are only called upon to vote when the network is grappling with a major economic change, said Jonny, the operator of the Solana Compass validator. SIMD-0228 is the third ever such vote to appear in records by StakingFacilities.com (the current proposal went up for consideration with an unrelated SIMD that passed). Its controversies sparked the highest turnout vote in the network's history. Over 66% of validators cast votes, according to a dashboard from Flipside Crypto . Together they wielded 75% of the network's voting power, a remarkable share given voting in this decentralized system is voluntary. Of participating validators with 500,000 SOL or less, over 60% voted against SIMD-0228, per a Dune dashboard . Larger validators saw the exact opposite: of validators with more than 500,000 SOL, 60% voted in favor. The lopsided results suggest opponents' warnings of economic ruin struck a nerve with small-time validators. Big Stakes Proponents of SIMD-0228 believe it would have solved Solana's inflation problem, which they claim drags down SOL's price. Their thinking goes like this: fewer tokens means fewer sellers, and fewer in the hands of tax collectors, too. In place of the network's static 4.7% SOL emissions that validators receive annually, they called for a dynamic system that adjusts to nudge staking trends up or down Opponents, meanwhile, called the proposal reckless and rushed. Some told CoinDesk they suspected its co-author, the influential investment company Multicoin Capital, had written it to favor its own interests. Others publicly warned SIMD-0228 would disrupt elements of Solana's DeFi economy, or turn off institutional investors who they claimed were attracted to SOL's native yield. Some doomsayers even claimed SIMD-0228 would chip away at Solana's decentralization by forcing hundreds of validators with small SOL stakes offline, though others dispute the size of the blow. Solana validators make money based on how much SOL they've staked, either from their own coffers or from tokens delegated to them by others. Those with smaller stakes are more acutely exposed to changes in emissions than those with bigger operators. ""Many people feel like SIMD-0228 is not the best proposal to address inflation on Solana,"" said SolBlaze, a validator operator. ""SIMD-0228 is a significant economic change, and changes on this scale deserve more time to discuss, analyze data, and iterate with feedback from different sectors of the ecosystem."" Reformists aren't going to give up the fight, said Max Resnick, one of the proposal's co-authors and an economic researcher at Anza Labs.

For those in the cryptocurrency space, always watching for tech disruptions and regulatory shifts, Google’s new AI Policy Proposal is a crucial development to understand. It directly addresses the hot-button issues of copyright and export controls, areas that will significantly shape the future of AI and, by extension, the digital landscape where crypto thrives. Why Google’s AI Policy Proposal is Turning Heads Following the Trump administration’s call for a national “AI Action Plan,” Google has released a comprehensive policy document. The core message? The U.S. needs to aggressively champion AI innovation on the global stage. But here’s where it gets interesting: Weakened Copyright Restrictions: Google advocates for ‘fair use’ and ‘text-and-data mining exceptions’ to be broadly applied to AI training data, even if that data is copyrighted. ‘Balanced’ Export Controls: While acknowledging national security, Google pushes for export controls that don’t stifle international business and the export of US AI technologies. Focus on Innovation over Risk: Google argues that AI policymaking has been overly focused on risks, potentially hindering innovation and U.S. competitiveness. They believe the current administration is starting to correct this imbalance. This stance is a clear signal from one of the biggest players in tech. But what exactly does Google want, and what are the implications for the wider tech and crypto ecosystems? Decoding Google’s Copyright Rules Stance: A Win for AI, a Worry for Creators? One of the most contentious parts of Google’s AI Policy Proposal revolves around intellectual property. Like OpenAI, Google wants to solidify the right to train AI models on publicly available data, including copyrighted material, with minimal restrictions. Their argument boils down to: ‘Fair Use’ is Key: Google asserts that ‘fair use’ and text/data mining exceptions are vital for AI development and scientific progress. Streamlined Data Access: They argue these exceptions prevent lengthy and unpredictable negotiations with data holders, speeding up AI development. Minimal Impact on Rightsholders (According to Google): Google claims using copyrighted, publicly available data for AI training doesn’t significantly harm copyright holders. However, this is where the battle lines are drawn. Google is already facing lawsuits from data owners who claim they should have been notified and compensated for the use of their copyrighted material in AI training. The courts are yet to definitively rule on whether ‘fair use’ protects AI developers from these IP claims. For crypto enthusiasts, this raises questions about data ownership, intellectual property in the digital age, and the balance between innovation and creator rights – themes that resonate deeply within the blockchain space. Export Controls: Balancing National Security and Global Business Google also takes aim at the current Export Controls imposed by the Biden administration. Their concern? These controls, while aimed at national security, could backfire by: Undermining Competitiveness: Google suggests export controls place a disproportionate burden on U.S. cloud service providers, making them less competitive globally. Contrasting Views: Interestingly, some of Google’s competitors, like Microsoft, have expressed confidence in their ability to comply with these export rules. Exemptions Exist: It’s important to note that the export rules do include exemptions for trusted companies needing large clusters of advanced AI chips, suggesting a nuanced approach rather than a blanket ban. The debate around Export Controls is crucial. How do we protect sensitive AI technology without stifling innovation and global collaboration? This tension is something that directly impacts the crypto world as well, where global, permissionless systems often clash with national regulatory frameworks. Beyond Copyright and Exports: What Else is in Google’s AI Policy Proposal? Google’s AI Policy Proposal goes beyond just copyright and export controls. Here are some other key recommendations: Sustained R&D Investment: Google calls for long-term, consistent funding for foundational AI research and development, pushing back against recent federal spending cuts. Open Data and Resources: They advocate for the government to release datasets that can aid commercial AI training and to ensure computing resources and AI models are widely accessible to researchers and institutions. Federal AI Legislation: Pointing to the confusing patchwork of state AI laws, Google urges federal AI legislation, including a unified privacy and security framework. The sheer number of pending AI bills (over 781 in early 2025) underscores the urgency for clarity. Liability and Transparency: Google cautions against overly broad liability obligations for AI developers and disclosure requirements, arguing they can be impractical and potentially harmful to innovation and national security. They suggest deployers are often better positioned to manage downstream risks. These points paint a picture of Google’s vision for a thriving AI ecosystem in the U.S. – one that is innovative, competitive, and globally influential. But is it a vision that adequately balances the risks and rewards of AI? The Big Question: Will Google’s Vision Reshape AI Regulation? Google’s AI Regulation proposals are significant because they come from a tech behemoth with immense influence. Their push for weakened Copyright Rules and ‘balanced’ Export Controls will undoubtedly fuel the ongoing debate about how to govern AI. For the crypto community, this is a space to watch closely. The principles being debated around AI – data ownership, regulation vs. innovation, global vs. national interests – are all deeply relevant to the future of decentralized technologies and digital assets. Will policymakers heed Google’s call? Will the courts side with Google on ‘fair use’ for AI training? The answers to these questions will have profound implications for the trajectory of AI development and the broader digital world.

Buckle up, crypto enthusiasts, because recent whispers from Washington suggest a potentially seismic shift in the government’s stance on Bitcoin. Imagine the U.S. government, not just regulating crypto, but actively accumulating it. This isn’t just speculation; it’s hinted at by a key White House official, sparking excitement and raising crucial questions across the digital asset landscape. Let’s dive deep into what this could mean for the future of Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Why the White House is Eyeing Bitcoin Reserves? According to a recent report from Decrypt, Bo Hines, the executive director of the White House’s digital assets working group, dropped a bombshell at a private roundtable. Hines reportedly stated that the Trump administration is seriously considering acquiring “as much Bitcoin as possible.” When pressed on the scale of this potential accumulation of Bitcoin reserves , his analogy was striking: “How many dollars would you want?” This comparison hints at a potentially vast ambition, suggesting Bitcoin might be viewed as a crucial asset on par with traditional currencies. While a White House official confirmed Hines’ statement, they were quick to add a crucial detail: any White House Bitcoin purchases would be “budget-neutral.” This suggests the administration is exploring ways to acquire Bitcoin without directly impacting the federal budget, perhaps through asset reallocation or other innovative financial mechanisms. This approach underscores a strategic, rather than impulsive, interest in Bitcoin reserves . Strategic Bitcoin Reserve: A New National Asset? Hines’ comments also extended to legislative support for a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.” While he didn’t explicitly endorse any specific bill, his indication of support is significant. But what exactly is a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve , and why is it gaining traction in Washington? Think of it like a national oil reserve, but for the digital age. A Strategic Bitcoin Reserve could serve multiple purposes: National Security: In an increasingly digital world, holding a significant Bitcoin reserves could be seen as a matter of national security, ensuring the U.S. remains competitive and influential in the evolving financial landscape. Financial Innovation: Embracing Bitcoin could position the U.S. as a leader in financial innovation, attracting talent and investment in the burgeoning crypto sector. Economic Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to national assets could offer diversification beyond traditional assets, potentially hedging against economic uncertainties and inflation. Geopolitical Influence: In a world where digital currencies are gaining prominence, a substantial Bitcoin reserves could enhance the U.S.’s geopolitical standing in the digital realm. Bitcoin Adoption: Is the US Following Global Trends? The idea of a nation-state holding Bitcoin reserves isn’t entirely novel. Several countries have already started exploring or implementing crypto strategies. El Salvador famously adopted Bitcoin as legal tender, and other nations are considering similar moves or adding Bitcoin to their treasuries. This potential move by the U.S. could be seen as part of a broader trend of global Bitcoin adoption , albeit on a much larger and more impactful scale. Here’s a glimpse at how other nations are approaching Bitcoin: Country Bitcoin Strategy Key Highlights El Salvador Legal Tender First country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender alongside USD. Central African Republic Legal Tender Second nation to make Bitcoin legal tender. Switzerland Crypto-Friendly Hub Known for its progressive crypto regulations and Zug “Crypto Valley.” Ukraine Legalized Crypto Assets Legalized and regulates crypto assets, actively seeking crypto donations. If the U.S. joins this list with a US Bitcoin policy focused on accumulation, it would send a powerful message to the world, potentially accelerating global crypto adoption and legitimizing Bitcoin as a mainstream asset. Navigating the Challenges of US Bitcoin Policy However, the path to establishing significant Bitcoin reserves for the U.S. government is not without its hurdles. Several challenges and considerations need to be addressed: Regulatory Clarity: Clear and consistent regulations are crucial for government entities to confidently engage with Bitcoin. Uncertainty could hinder large-scale acquisitions and management of Bitcoin reserves . Security and Custody: Safeguarding vast amounts of Bitcoin requires robust security measures and secure custody solutions. The government would need to implement state-of-the-art security protocols to prevent theft or loss. Market Volatility: Bitcoin’s price volatility is a significant factor. The government would need strategies to manage the risks associated with price fluctuations in its Bitcoin reserves . Public Perception: Public and political acceptance is essential. Educating the public and policymakers about the benefits and rationale behind a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve will be crucial for garnering support. Budget Neutrality: Ensuring Bitcoin reserves acquisitions are truly budget-neutral, as stated by the White House official, will require careful financial planning and execution. What’s Next for the White House Bitcoin Strategy? The news from the White House is still developing, but it signals a potentially transformative moment for Bitcoin and the crypto industry. While details remain scarce, the mere suggestion of the U.S. government considering large-scale Bitcoin reserves is a game-changer. Keep a close watch on legislative developments, official statements, and market reactions in the coming weeks and months. This could be the beginning of a new era in US Bitcoin policy and global crypto adoption. The implications are far-reaching, potentially impacting everything from Bitcoin’s price trajectory to the broader geopolitical landscape. Is this the dawn of nation-state Bitcoin accumulation? Only time will tell, but the signs are undeniably intriguing. In conclusion, the White House’s consideration of expanding Bitcoin reserves marks a significant shift in the narrative around cryptocurrency. It underscores the growing recognition of Bitcoin’s strategic importance and its potential role in the future financial system. While challenges remain, the potential benefits of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve for national security, financial innovation, and economic diversification are compelling. This development warrants close attention as it unfolds, potentially reshaping the future of finance and the role of digital assets in the global economy.

Could we see a Solana spot ETF hitting the U.S. market sooner than we think? According to Titan founder Chris Chung, the answer might just be yes, and potentially as early as May. Let’s dive into this exciting development and explore what it could mean for Solana and the broader crypto landscape. Why the Buzz Around a Solana Spot ETF? The anticipation for a crypto ETF, particularly a Solana ETF, has been steadily building. But why all the excitement? Essentially, a spot ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) focused on Solana would allow investors to gain exposure to Solana (SOL) without directly holding the cryptocurrency itself. Think of it as buying shares in a fund that holds Solana, making it significantly easier and more accessible for traditional investors to participate in the Solana ecosystem. This ease of access is a major driver behind the push for crypto ETFs in general. Key Benefits of a Solana Spot ETF: Increased Accessibility: A Solana spot ETF would open the doors for retail and institutional investors who are currently hesitant or unable to directly purchase and manage SOL due to regulatory hurdles or technical complexities. Enhanced Liquidity: ETFs are traded on traditional stock exchanges, which are highly liquid markets. This increased liquidity can lead to tighter spreads and easier trading for Solana investors. Regulatory Comfort: For many institutional investors, investing through a regulated ETF structure provides a greater sense of security and compliance compared to directly holding digital assets. This regulatory comfort is crucial for attracting institutional investment into Solana. Tax Advantages: Depending on the jurisdiction, ETFs can offer certain tax advantages compared to directly holding cryptocurrencies. The CME Futures Factor: A Stepping Stone to SEC Approval? Chris Chung’s optimism about SEC approval for a Solana spot ETF by May hinges on a significant development: the upcoming launch of Solana futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). Let’s understand why this is such a crucial factor. The SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) has historically been cautious about approving spot crypto ETFs, primarily due to concerns about market manipulation and investor protection in the underlying spot markets. However, regulated futures markets like the CME are seen as more mature and less susceptible to manipulation due to their oversight and established trading infrastructure. Chung argues that the existence of regulated Solana futures on the CME provides a stronger case for the SEC to approve a Solana spot ETF. Here’s why: Market Maturity Signal: The launch of CME futures signals that Solana is gaining recognition as a mature and established asset class, moving beyond just being considered a speculative memecoin. Surveillance Sharing Agreements: The SEC often requires “surveillance sharing agreements” with regulated exchanges that list futures of the underlying asset for spot ETF approvals. CME futures pave the way for such agreements. Precedent Set by Bitcoin and Ethereum: The SEC’s eventual approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs after CME futures were established sets a precedent. Solana could follow a similar trajectory. VanEck and Canary Capital Leading the Charge Two prominent players, VanEck and Canary Capital, are reportedly leading the charge in seeking SEC approval for a Solana spot ETF. VanEck, a well-known asset manager with a history of crypto ETF filings, and Canary Capital, a digital asset investment firm, are both betting on Solana’s growing prominence in the crypto space. Their applications are likely to highlight Solana’s technological advantages, growing ecosystem, and increasing institutional interest. However, it’s important to remember that the SEC approval process is rigorous and unpredictable. While Chung’s prediction offers a hopeful timeline, the SEC ultimately holds the cards. Challenges and Considerations for Solana ETF Approval Despite the optimism, several challenges and considerations could impact the timeline and likelihood of Solana spot ETF approval: SEC Scrutiny: The SEC remains cautious about crypto assets and could raise further concerns or request additional information, delaying the approval process. Market Volatility: The inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market, including Solana, could be a point of concern for the SEC. Regulatory Landscape: The evolving regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the U.S. adds uncertainty to the approval process. Competition from Other ETFs: The success of already approved Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs could influence the SEC’s decision on Solana, but it also means increased competition in the crypto ETF space. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? Whether you’re a seasoned crypto investor or just starting to explore the space, the potential approval of a Solana spot ETF is something to watch closely. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep track of news and developments related to Solana ETF applications and SEC announcements. Research Solana: If you’re unfamiliar with Solana, now might be a good time to research its technology, ecosystem, and potential. Consider Diversification: A Solana ETF, if approved, could be a way to diversify your crypto portfolio. Manage Expectations: SEC approval is not guaranteed, and even if approved, the timeline could be longer than anticipated. Conclusion: A Potentially Transformative Moment for Solana Chris Chung’s prediction of a potential Solana spot ETF approval by May is undoubtedly exciting news for the Solana community and the broader crypto market. The launch of CME futures is a significant step towards legitimizing Solana as an institutional-grade asset, and the efforts of VanEck and Canary Capital could pave the way for a groundbreaking financial product.

Unlike traditional marketplaces, Web3Bay offers a 5% cashback on every purchase, providing shoppers with real financial rewards through its native 3BAY tokens. This approach isn’t just about getting discounts; it creates a new way for users to earn as they shop, turning routine purchases into rewarding experiences. The platform’s unique earn-as-you-shop model aims to boost user engagement by offering incentives that go beyond traditional loyalty programs. This not only encourages repeated visits but also cultivates a sense of community within its decentralized marketplace. With Web3Bay, shopping becomes an opportunity to save money and earn valuable tokens, making it a standout choice in the world of crypto e-commerce. Web3Bay’s Earn-As-You-Shop Model Explained At the core of Web3Bay’s model is the principle of rewarding users for their activity on the platform. Shoppers receive a 5% cashback in 3BAY tokens on every purchase, instantly turning everyday shopping into a source of income. These tokens can be held for potential value appreciation, used for future purchases, or even traded, offering real versatility. This cashback mechanism works seamlessly within the platform’s blockchain-based infrastructure, ensuring transparency and instant rewards. Unlike traditional cashback programs that might take weeks to process, Web3Bay’s rewards are delivered quickly, providing an immediate incentive to stay engaged. The 3BAY token itself is designed to integrate into the platform’s broader ecosystem, enabling users to participate in governance decisions and access special discounts, further enhancing the shopping experience. Web3Bay’s approach contrasts sharply with typical e-commerce sites, where rewards are often limited to specific products or services. Here, the reward system is intrinsic to every transaction, fostering a genuine earn-as-you-shop experience. This not only motivates users to spend but also builds loyalty by aligning the platform’s growth with the financial benefits of its users. Presale Progress: A Snapshot of Success Web3Bay’s presale is currently in its 5th stage, demonstrating strong momentum and growing interest. The 3BAY token is priced at $0.004562625, offering early participants a chance to secure tokens before the platform’s full launch. The presale has already raised over $1.6 million, and approximately 400 million tokens have been sold, highlighting the project’s potential appeal. Investing in the presale offers more than just the opportunity to buy tokens at a lower price. The anticipated launch price of the 3BAY token is set at $0.1959, which could provide early supporters with a remarkable return on investment of approximately 6,430%. This substantial growth potential is a testament to the market’s confidence in Web3Bay’s vision and its innovative approach to e-commerce. The presale’s progress not only reflects the project’s market traction but also reinforces the value proposition of Web3Bay’s 5% cashback model. By participating now, users can maximize their benefits from both the shopping rewards and potential token appreciation, setting the stage for long-term gains. Creating Real Value with 3BAY Token Rewards The 3BAY token isn’t just a digital reward; it represents real value with multiple utilities within the Web3Bay ecosystem. Users can earn tokens through regular shopping, but the benefits extend far beyond that. The token can be staked to earn additional rewards, used for purchases on the marketplace, or held with the potential for future appreciation as Web3Bay grows. Additionally, the 3BAY token plays a role in the platform’s governance. Token holders gain voting rights, allowing them to influence key decisions about platform development, new features, and community initiatives. This democratic approach empowers users, giving them a voice in the direction of the marketplace while incentivizing them to remain active participants. This model creates a feedback loop where user engagement directly contributes to the platform’s success, and in return, users are rewarded financially. By offering tangible value through the 3BAY token, Web3Bay transforms casual shoppers into invested stakeholders, driving a deeper connection to the platform. How Web3Bay Stands Out in the E-Commerce Market Web3Bay’s 5% cashback offer is a straightforward and powerful incentive that sets it apart from traditional e-commerce models. While most online marketplaces rely on sales and discounts to attract shoppers, Web3Bay’s model adds an earning potential to every purchase. This shift from simply saving money to actually earning tokens redefines how users perceive value when shopping online. The platform’s focus on decentralization also means reduced transaction fees and increased transparency. Without the need for traditional intermediaries, users benefit from lower costs and faster processing times. The cashback rewards are not tied to restrictive conditions or complicated points systems. Instead, every purchase directly benefits the buyer, contributing to an ecosystem where spending and earning are closely linked. Web3Bay also incorporates smart contract technology to manage transactions and rewards automatically. This reduces the risk of errors, ensures the accuracy of cashback rewards, and builds trust among users. The integration of blockchain technology means that all transactions are verifiable, creating a level of transparency that is hard to match in conventional online marketplaces. Loyalty and Long-Term Benefits for Shoppers Web3Bay doesn’t just offer a one-time reward; it encourages long-term engagement through its loyalty programs. Regular shoppers accumulate 3BAY tokens with every purchase, and these tokens can be used for future discounts or staked for more rewards. The platform’s upcoming features, including a planned integration with PayPal, are likely to attract even more users and enhance the versatility of its reward system. The earn-as-you-shop model also introduces an element of strategy. Savvy shoppers can choose to hold onto their 3BAY tokens, potentially benefiting from market value increases as the platform grows. This blend of immediate and long-term rewards helps Web3Bay maintain user interest and loyalty, offering benefits that extend well beyond the checkout process. Web3Bay’s approach transforms shopping into a rewarding activity that benefits users financially while also building a stronger, more vibrant community. By aligning its growth with the interests of its shoppers, the platform creates a mutually beneficial ecosystem where everyone has the opportunity to gain. The Last Line Web3Bay is not just another e-commerce platform—it is a marketplace where every purchase comes with tangible financial rewards. Its 5% cashback model, delivered through the 3BAY token, turns routine shopping into an opportunity to earn. The platform’s combination of instant rewards, long-term incentives, and community-driven governance makes it an attractive choice for anyone looking to get more value from their spending. By offering a seamless and transparent shopping experience, Web3Bay is setting a new standard in the industry. Its earn-as-you-shop model is a powerful draw, providing both discounts and a pathway to earning real digital assets. With the presale already in its 5th stage, the momentum is building, making now an ideal time to get involved. As the platform continues to evolve, it holds the promise of redefining how we think about rewards, loyalty, and the intersection of e-commerce with cryptocurrency.

Vermont’s Department of Financial Regulation said in a March 13 order that in light of the US Securities and Exchange Commission tossing out its case on Feb. 28 , it would follow suit and rescind its action against Coinbase without prejudice. “The SEC has announced the formation of a new task force to, among other things, provide guidance for the promulgation of rules regarding the regulation of cryptocurrency products and services,” the department said. Vermont’s financial regulator has decided to drop its legal action against Coinbase. Source: Vermont’s Department of Financial Regulation “In light of the dismissal of the Federal Action and likelihood of new federal regulatory guidance, the Division believes it would be most efficient and in the best interests of justice to rescind the pending Show Cause Order, without prejudice.” On the same day the SEC filed its lawsuit in June 2023, the US states of Alabama, California, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey, South Carolina, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin said they were launching legal proceedings against Coinbase . The show cause order asserted that Coinbase was violating securities laws by offering staking to its users without a license and demanded the exchange provide a reason why the courts shouldn’t hit them with an order directing them to halt the service. Now that Vermont has opted out, Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal said in a March 13 statement to X that the other states with staking actions should take a “page from Vermont’s playbook.” Source: Paul Grewal “As we have always said: staking services are not securities. We applaud Vermont for embracing progress and providing clarity for its citizens who own digital assets,” he said. “Our work isn’t over. Congress must seize the bipartisan momentum we’re seeing across the House and Senate to pass comprehensive legislation that takes into account the novel features of digital assets, such as staking,” he added.

On-chain data reveals a purchase of 541,242 SEI tokens for a whopping $100,000. This move has sent ripples through the crypto community, sparking discussions about potential implications and motivations behind this substantial crypto investment . Decoding the World Liberty & SEI Token Transaction The transaction, which occurred at 4:11 UTC+8 on March 14, was executed via Cow Protocol, a decentralized trading platform known for its efficiency and MEV protection. According to a post by Wu Blockchain on X (formerly Twitter), the purchased SEI tokens were initially held in the ‘World Liberty address’ before being transferred back to the World Liberty Foundation’s main address. This swift movement raises questions and adds layers of intrigue to the entire operation. Let’s break down the key elements of this developing story: The Players: The central figures are the ‘World Liberty address,’ linked to the Trump family project, and SEI, the native token of the SEI Network. The Transaction: A substantial purchase of 541,242 SEI tokens for $100,000. The Platform: The purchase was made through Cow Protocol, highlighting the use of decentralized platforms for significant crypto transactions. The Source: Information surfaced via Wu Blockchain on X, underscoring the role of crypto-focused social media in breaking news. The Transfer: Tokens were moved from a specific ‘World Liberty address’ back to the World Liberty Foundation’s main address, suggesting a strategic allocation within the organization. Why is this World Liberty Crypto Investment News Significant? The involvement of an entity linked to the Trump family in a crypto investment is noteworthy for several reasons. Firstly, it brings traditional political and business spheres closer to the digital asset space. Secondly, the choice of SEI Network, a relatively newer blockchain focused on speed and scalability, suggests a strategic alignment with projects emphasizing technological advancement in the crypto sector. But why SEI? And why now? Let’s delve deeper into the possible motivations. Potential Reasons Behind the SEI Token Purchase Several theories are circulating within the crypto community regarding the rationale behind this SEI token acquisition by the World Liberty address. Here are a few plausible explanations: Strategic Diversification: World Liberty might be diversifying its portfolio by venturing into promising altcoins like SEI. SEI Network’s focus on DeFi and trading infrastructure could be seen as a future-proof investment. Speculative Investment: The purchase could be purely speculative, betting on the potential price appreciation of SEI tokens. The crypto market is known for its volatility, and strategic investments in promising projects can yield significant returns. Project Partnership: There might be an underlying partnership or collaboration in the works between World Liberty and the SEI Network ecosystem. Investing in SEI tokens could be a precursor to a more significant collaboration. Publicity and Awareness: The association with a known entity like World Liberty and its Trump family links could bring positive attention and publicity to the SEI Network and its token. Analyzing the On-Chain Data: What Does it Tell Us? The beauty of blockchain technology lies in its transparency. On-chain data provides a verifiable record of all transactions, offering insights that are often unavailable in traditional financial systems. In this case, the on-chain data confirms the transaction details – the amount of SEI purchased, the price, the time, and the wallets involved. This transparency is crucial for building trust and verifying information in the often-opaque world of finance. Here’s what analyzing on-chain data can reveal: Data Point Details from On-Chain Analysis Token Purchased SEI Amount 541,242 SEI Purchase Price $100,000 Exchange Platform Cow Protocol Time of Transaction March 14, 4:11 UTC+8 Initial Wallet World Liberty Address (Specific Address – needs further research) Destination Wallet World Liberty Foundation Main Address (Specific Address – needs further research) The Trump Family Crypto Connection: What We Know The phrase “Trump family project” linked to the World Liberty address adds another layer of complexity and interest to this story. While the exact nature of the Trump family’s involvement with World Liberty remains somewhat ambiguous in publicly available information, the association itself draws significant attention. Any venture connected to such a prominent family is bound to generate buzz, especially in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency landscape. It remains to be seen if this World Liberty investment signals a broader interest in crypto from the Trump family or if it’s an isolated strategic move. Navigating Crypto Investments: Key Takeaways This news story serves as a compelling example of the dynamic nature of crypto investment and the increasing intersection of traditional entities with the digital asset world. For those looking to navigate the crypto investment landscape, here are some key takeaways: Due Diligence is Paramount: Always conduct thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency. Understand the project, its team, technology, and market potential. On-Chain Data is Your Friend: Utilize blockchain explorers to verify transactions and gain insights into token movements and wallet activities. Stay Informed: The crypto market is fast-paced. Keep up-to-date with the latest news, trends, and developments through reputable sources. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification across different cryptocurrencies and asset classes can mitigate risk. Understand Risk: Cryptocurrency investments are inherently risky. Only invest what you can afford to lose and be prepared for market volatility. Conclusion: A New Chapter in Crypto and World Liberty? The World Liberty address’s $100,000 purchase of SEI tokens marks a fascinating development in the crypto narrative. Whether this is a strategic long-term investment, a speculative play, or a precursor to something bigger, it undoubtedly underscores the growing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies and the increasing involvement of diverse entities in the digital asset space. As we continue to monitor on-chain data and await further developments, this story serves as a potent reminder of the ever-evolving and often surprising nature of the crypto world. The intersection of traditional entities with the decentralized world of crypto is just beginning, and the implications are vast and yet to be fully realized.

While the price has been making higher highs, the 3-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) has been making lower highs. This suggests that the upward momentum may not be as strong as it appears. According to analyst Josh of Crypto World, the market should not expect any major bullish moves for now. Short-term bounces are normal, but sustained upward momentum like we saw in the past is unlikely in the near future. Struggling at Key Resistance Levels In the shorter term, looking at the 8-hour chart, XRP recently bounced from a support area and moved up towards a resistance zone between $2.25 and $2.30. As anticipated, the price is now struggling at this level. If XRP manages to break above $2.30 and closes a candle above this level, it could indicate a potential continuation towards $2.50-$2.60. However, the next significant resistance area lies between $2.65 and $2.80. Sideways Price Movement and Trading Opportunities Currently, XRP’s price is stuck in a sideways range, struggling to find momentum in either direction. Although the price is bouncing from support, it’s also facing resistance around $2.25 to $2.30. For traders, this creates opportunities to trade within this range. A break below key support levels might signal a short position, while a bounce off support could lead to a long position. Additionally, a confirmed breakout above resistance could present another opportunity for short-term gains. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.25 and is up by more than one percent in the last 24 hours. As for Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency is down by more than two percent and is trading at $81,000.",News|Altcoins|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|BTC|ALTCOIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-14 01:13:14

Sesame AI, the startup famed for its incredibly realistic virtual assistant Maya, has just dropped a bombshell: the base AI model that powers Maya is now open source! This move is poised to democratize advanced voice technology, but also raises some critical questions about the responsible use of such potent tools. For those in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, this news highlights the accelerating pace of innovation in AI and its potential ripple effects across various sectors. What is Sesame’s Open Source AI Model CSM-1B? Sesame’s groundbreaking release is CSM-1B, a 1 billion parameter AI model made available under the permissive Apache 2.0 license. But what does this actually mean? Let’s break it down: Open Source Accessibility: The Apache 2.0 license essentially gives developers a green light to use, modify, and distribute CSM-1B for commercial purposes with minimal restrictions. This open approach is a significant departure from the often-closed nature of cutting-edge AI models. Powering Maya: CSM-1B is the foundational technology behind Maya, Sesame’s viral voice assistant that impressed users with its lifelike speech patterns, including natural breaths and disfluencies. Think of it as the engine that makes Maya sound so human. Technical Deep Dive: CSM-1B generates what Sesame calls “RVQ audio codes” from text and audio inputs. RVQ, or residual vector quantization, is a method for converting audio into discrete tokens. This technique is also used in other advanced AI audio technologies from tech giants like Google and Meta, indicating Sesame is playing in the big leagues. Built on Strong Foundations: The model leverages the architecture of Meta’s Llama family of models as its core, combined with a specialized audio “decoder.” This strategic combination allows CSM-1B to effectively translate text and audio into realistic speech. In essence, Sesame has handed over the keys to a powerful generative AI engine that can create diverse voices. While the released CSM-1B is a base model and not fine-tuned to a specific voice like Maya, it provides a robust starting point for developers to build upon. The Potential and the Pitfalls of Open Source Generative AI The decision to open source CSM-1B is both exciting and potentially fraught with challenges. Let’s explore both sides of the coin: The Upsides: Democratizing AI Innovation Accelerated Development: Open sourcing CSM-1B can foster rapid innovation. Developers worldwide can experiment, improve, and build upon the model, potentially leading to unforeseen advancements in voice assistant technology and AI audio applications. Wider Accessibility: By removing licensing barriers, Sesame is making sophisticated generative AI technology accessible to a broader range of developers, including smaller startups and independent researchers who might not have the resources to build such models from scratch. Transparency and Scrutiny: Open source models are inherently more transparent. The code and architecture are available for public scrutiny, which can lead to better understanding and identification of potential biases or vulnerabilities. The Downsides: Navigating Ethical Gray Areas Lack of Safeguards: Sesame openly admits that CSM-1B has minimal built-in safeguards. This “honor system” approach relies on developers to self-regulate and avoid misuse, which is a significant concern. Potential for Misinformation and Misuse: The ability to clone voices easily, as demonstrated in the demo, opens the door to malicious applications like creating deepfakes, spreading misinformation through realistic fake audio, or impersonating individuals without consent. Imagine the implications for social media or even the cryptocurrency space where scams are already prevalent. Ethical Responsibility: While Sesame urges responsible use, the open-source nature means they have limited control over how CSM-1B is ultimately deployed. The burden of ethical considerations largely falls on the developers and users who adopt the model. Experimenting with CSM-1B: A Minute to Clone Your Voice? The article author’s personal experience of cloning their voice in under a minute using the Hugging Face demo highlights the ease of use and the speed at which realistic voice generation can be achieved with CSM-1B. This rapid cloning capability, while impressive from a technological standpoint, underscores the potential for misuse if not handled responsibly. Sesame’s Vision Beyond Voice Assistants: AI Glasses on the Horizon Sesame, backed by prominent investors like Andreessen Horowitz, isn’t just focused on voice assistant technology. The company is also venturing into hardware, prototyping AI glasses designed for all-day wear, powered by their custom AI models. This ambition signals a broader vision for integrating AI seamlessly into everyday life, moving beyond software applications to wearable technology. What Does This Mean for the Future of AI and Crypto? While seemingly disparate, the advancements in generative AI like Sesame’s CSM-1B have indirect but significant implications for the cryptocurrency and blockchain space. Here’s why: Enhanced User Experience: AI-powered interfaces, including advanced voice assistants, can simplify interactions with complex blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies, making them more accessible to a wider audience. New Applications in Decentralized Systems: AI models like CSM-1B could be integrated into decentralized platforms for various applications, from creating more engaging user interfaces to developing novel forms of content creation and interaction within decentralized ecosystems. Increased Scrutiny and Regulation: The ethical concerns surrounding powerful generative AI technologies will likely intensify the debate around AI regulation. This regulatory landscape will indirectly impact the cryptocurrency space as both sectors grapple with issues of trust, security, and responsible innovation. Conclusion: A Powerful Tool with Great Responsibility Sesame’s release of CSM-1B is a landmark moment in the open-source AI landscape. It offers incredible potential for innovation and democratization of advanced voice technology. However, it also presents significant ethical challenges and underscores the urgent need for responsible development and deployment of such powerful tools. As developers and users gain access to this technology, the onus is on them to wield it ethically and consider the broader societal implications. The future of generative AI is exciting, but navigating its complexities will require careful consideration and a commitment to responsible innovation.

Market optimism grows as Ripple secures regulatory approval in Dubai. Ripple (XRP) Traders Holding 23% Gains This Week, Despite Volatile Market Trends Ripple (XRP) price surged past the $2.30 mark on Thursday, securing a 23% gain on the weekly timeframe. Despite volatile price action, XRP fluctuated within a 5% range between $2.10 and $2.35 throughout the day. The early US trading session saw a brief rally fueled by softer-than-expected CPI and PPI data, indicating easing inflation. However, by the close of European trading, market sentiment had shifted as escalating US-Canada trade tensions erased earlier gains. Ripple (XRP) Price Action Ripple price dipped another 2% on Thursday, but a closer look at the XRP/USDT weekly price chart suggests that the token has yet to succumb to full bearish control. Trading at $2.34 at press time, XRP remains firmly within its 23% weekly gain range. Bullish momentum surrounding the anticipated approval of XRP ETFs and its potential inclusion in the US strategic crypto reserve has been a major catalyst for sustained buying activity. Many investors who acquired XRP during these key developments have held onto their unrealized profits, signaling confidence in further upside. The reluctance to sell suggests that traders may be waiting for confirmation of ETF approval or funding allocations to the proposed crypto reserve under the Trump administration. Ripple Secures Key Regulatory Approval to Expand Crypto Payment Services in Dubai On Thursday, Ripple Labs, obtained a regulatory license from the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA), granting it the ability to provide crypto payment services to businesses across the region. Obtaining operation license in United Arab Emirate, with a GDP of $277 billion, represents a milestone makes Ripple the first blockchain-powered payment provider to receive DFSA authorization, marking a significant step in its global expansion strategy. “We are thrilled that Ripple is deepening their commitment to Dubai by securing a DFSA license that makes them the first blockchain-enabled payments provider in DIFC,” – Arif Amiri, Chief Executive Officer of DIFC Authority The approval comes amid Ripple’s broader push into international markets, particularly in regions where regulatory clarity is fostering greater institutional adoption. Ripple has reported that approximately 20% of its global user base is located in the Middle East, underscoring the region’s strategic importance. “We are entering an unprecedented period of growth for the crypto industry, driven by greater regulatory clarity around the world and increasing institutional adoption,” – Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse. This latest achievement follows Ripple’s acquisition of Money Transmitter Licenses (MTLs) in regulatory-heavy US states such as New York and Texas, enabling it to expand payment services in those jurisdictions. Ripple now boasts over 50 MTLs in the United States and holds more than 60 licenses worldwide, solidifying its presence as a leading blockchain-powered payments provider. XRP Price Forecast: Bulls Defend $2 as Market Eyes Next Breakout XRP price has held above the critical $2 support level, with technical indicators hinting at a potential bullish continuation. The XRPUSDT weekly chart below shows a sharp rebound from $1.90, marking a 23.53% recovery after a 27.53% correction. This suggests that buyers have re-entered the market, preventing further downside. XRP Price Forecast The Keltner Channel (KC) bands show XRP consolidating within the mid-range, with resistance at $3.32 and support at $2.14. A breakout above the mid-band could confirm a renewed uptrend, while rejection could trigger another retest of lower levels. Parabolic SAR dots remain above the price, indicating lingering bearish pressure, but a flip to the underside could validate bullish momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 54.93, just below the overbought zone of 70.86. This signals room for further upside if buyers sustain pressure. However, failure to reclaim $2.35 resistance could lead to consolidation or renewed selling pressure.

This surge is attributed to growing speculation that Binance will announce a listing of Pi Coin on March 14th, Pi Day. As a result, there has been increased buying pressure as investors anticipate major developments for the cryptocurrency. As Pi Day approaches, keep an eye on developments that could drastically impact Pi’s price and an analyst has explained possible price movements. Potential Scenarios for Pi’s Price Movement Optimistic Outlook: If Pi is listed on Binance, we could see an explosive rally. Pi might break its previous all-time high of $3 and surge to the $4 to $4.50 range within days. If the market sees Pi as a key player in the crypto space, it could even reach $7 to $10 in the short term. Balanced Scenario: A more modest rally could see Pi hit around $3.14 on Pi Day. This would be driven by the excitement of new exchange listings, creating a solid support level for future growth. Cautious Scenario: On the flip side, Pi could face a correction after initial excitement fades. In this case, Pi might only reach around $3 or even fall back to $2. This would reflect a typical crypto market correction. The Unique Appeal of Pi Coin What sets Pi apart from other cryptocurrencies is its community and mobile mining capabilities. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies that require expensive hardware and high energy consumption, Pi allows users to mine using their smartphones, offering an eco-friendly alternative. This unique approach, combined with strong community support, could position Pi as a significant player in the digital currency space. At the time of writing, Pi Coin is down by more than 3% and is trading at $1.67.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,TRADING|EXCHANGE|BNB|ALTCOIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-14 01:31:17

According to CNN , the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) proposes cutting the Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS) workforce by 20%. DOGE plans to slash IRS workforce by 20% in cost-cutting move The cuts are expected to take effect mid-May and would impact an estimated 6,800 government agency employees. According to the latest IRS data, the federal tax collector employs roughly 90,000 workers across the United States. In February, roughly 7,000 probationary IRS employees with one year or less of service were laid off from the organization. However, a recent ruling by U.S. District Judge William Alsup requiring federal agencies to reinstate probationary employees terminated under DOGE’s cost-cutting programs could hinder the planned reviews if it isn’t overturned. Trump pushes tax reform to cut federal debt President Trump has promised comprehensive tax reform in the United States, including potentially eliminating the federal income tax and funding the federal government exclusively through tariffs on foreign goods . The Department of Government Efficiency, helmed by businessman Elon Musk, is considering cutting the $36 trillion U.S. national debt by drastically reducing the size of the federal bureaucracy and instituting aggressive cost-cutting measures. It has some unusual proposals, like putting all public spending on a chain to reduce deficits and increase transparency. At the end of February, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced cutting its regional office directors to comply with the Trump administration’s cost-saving directives. However, under the reorganization plan, the regional offices, which are spread out across major US cities, would stay open, and the SEC recently submitted its 2025 budget proposal to Congress requesting $2.6 billion. President Trump and Elon Musk have discussed allocating 20% of the savings from DOGE’s cost-cutting measures to Americans through stimulus checks or potential tax credits. Meanwhile, research from accounting automation firm Dancing Numbers suggests that Trump’s proposal to eliminate federal income tax could save the average American approximately $134,809 over their lifetime. Moreover, the firm noted that these lifetime tax savings could extend to as much as $325,561 per person if other wage-based taxes at the state level are also repealed. Critics slam DOGE’s federal job cuts and tax plans Still, not everyone is convinced by DOGE’s cost-cutting tactics, including US Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is highly critical of Elon Musk, Trump, and DOGE. At the beginning of the year, the Massachusetts Senator sent a letter to the DOGE proposing increasing taxes and federal spending. The senator argued that these strategies would make the government more efficient. Alongside the planned layoffs, the Trump administration plans to reassign IRS workers to the Department of Homeland Security to support immigration enforcement. In a February letter, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem requested Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to temporarily transfer IRS employees to assist with the ongoing immigration crackdown.

Phase 3 is open and tokens are purchased for $0.02 each. The upcoming Phase 4 will offer MUTM tokens at $0.025 while Phase 3 continues to fill up its capacity which generates excitement for present owners. The market trend reflects overall crypto optimism because Solana (SOL) currently shows signs of recovery after its recent price corrections. The potential of a SOL price reaching $870 is now under analyst investigation while Mutuum Finance’s structured borrowing protocols make MUTM a solid candidate for a future value increase to $3. Mutuum Finance Presale Momentum The continuous influx of buyers is filling Phase 3 of Mutuum Finance ’s presale because investors want to acquire tokens at current prices before future rate adjustments. People who bought MUTM at Phase 2 for $0.015 during December earned 400% profit on their investment before its upcoming $0.06 exchange listing. Each presale phase within Tokenomics implements predetermined pricing accelerations which drives buyers to enter before each increase occurs. Market experts predict that MUTM tokens will reach a valuation of $3 by late 2025 whereas the present token value rests at $0.02 indicating a potential 15,000% increase. The lending features of the platform are leading to continuous buying demand. The protocol uses part of its fees to acquire MUTM tokens from open markets which then get redistributed to stakers and liquidity providers. The features encourage owners to retain MUTM for extended durations while simultaneously decreasing token availability. Every member of Mutuum Finance receives two key advantages: deposit certificates called mtTokens that grow in value over time combined with utility that gives them scarcity value which most popular speculative tokens lack. The initial presale resources go toward forming liquidity pools and ecosystem growth initiatives while making up more than 80% of the budget. Solana’s Race Against Resistance Solana (SOL) seeks to break through crucial resistance zones because network architecture modifications and decentralized finance transactions create an optimistic market environment. The platform has fixed itself in decentralized trading and NFT markets because it operates transactions at speeds of less than 400 milliseconds while costing an average fee of $0.00025. The $260 bull market high needs long-term holder buys and macroeconomic stability before SOL can reach it again. The price target of $870 requires SOL to gain 1,300% of its present value while maintaining trading volume and experiencing general cryptocurrency market expansion. The robust technical foundation of Solana faces short-term limits based on Ethereum layer-2 competition and changing meme coin market dynamics. Mutuum Finance implements a different strategy through its presale-based approach which achieves volatility reduction by establishing fixed tokenomics rules. SOL’s success hinges on external factors like Bitcoin’s performance and regulatory shifts—variables beyond its protocol’s control. Timing the Market’s Next Leap The presale structure at Mutuum Finance provides solid project progress tracking which decentralized projects normally lack. New members of Phase 3 instantly activate cash gains after Phase 4 goes live which proves very rare for crypto ventures at this early development phase. The final phase of the presale price drops to $0.05 immediately before the $0.06 exchange listing allows all participants to earn 20% profit while they benefit from escalated prices following exchange listing. Past DeFi launches based their pricing models on $3 tokens which demonstrated price surges of 500% to 1000% in weeks thereby putting MUTM on track for its price target. The cryptocurrency market intensifies where Mutuum Finance provides dissimilar benefits to Solana regarding risk and reward potential. The market forces affecting SOL result in gradual upwards shifts but MUTM attracts early investors throughout its presale distribution with deflationary token designs that minimize risks and maximize profits. Protocol-developed scarcity drives Phase 3 investors toward its rapidly closing $0.02 price band if they want exponential market gains through available scarcity mechanisms. The predictable growth path of MUTM exceeds other speculative investment strategies.

The token’s current price is a far cry from its 52-week high of $3.38 last January 17th, which was spurred by the industry’s excitement over US President Donald Trump’s reelection.

According to crypto analyst Egrag Crypto, Ripple’s XRP is set for another price run after it compares the asset’s current Elliot Wave structure with its 2017 fractals. XRP Continues To Weather The Storm Egrag Crypto’s latest price analysis and projection for XRP come as the altcoin and the broader crypto market slump. The Ripple’s coin is holding steady above the critical $2 price support, which suggests it follows the broad five-wave Elliott Wave chart. Traditionally, assets replicating the Elliott Wave structure often incur significant price action. #XRP = Thread (1/7) #XRP: Double Digits This Cycle, Triple Digits Next!

We’ve built together the Full Elliot Wave Count to assess our next Targets: 🎯✨ Take an in-depth look at it! 🔍… pic.twitter.com/NKv00Y5MZD — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) March 12, 2025 Based on Egrag’s assessment, XRP is currently in the second wave of the Elliot Wave structure, which is traditionally defined by high price volatility and corrections. Traders And Investors Must Watch Out For The Larger Wave Structure In a Twitter/X post, Egrag explained that XRP is in its corrective wave two and is primed for a price run to double digits or even over $100. The analysts elaborated that a Wave 2 often retraces a part of Wave 1, usually matching 50%, 76% or even 85.4% of the initial movement. Ripple’s XRP, he shares, is solidifying its hold in the correction phase. The asset faces bearish pressure, and the market can expect a double bottom soon before it moves into its Wave 3. EGRAG warns that Wave 3 is the most aggressive part of the cycle, with more volatility. Can XRP Hit $100 Or More? Previously, XRP’s Wave 1 pattern submitted a huge 733% increase in price. And by using the Elliot Wave extension formula, the popular analyst projects that XRP’s Wave 3 can extend by 1.618x the gain of the first wave. Using this calculation, Egrag offers a potential surge of 1,185x, translating to XRP’s price range between $22 to $24. Once XRP hits the peak of Wave 3, the fourth wave and a price correction follows. For this wage, the retracement level ranges between 14% to 38.2% of Wave 3. If this happens, Egrag predicts that XRP’s price can drop to $8. Related Reading: TRUMP Token Takedown—Did Insiders Plan The Crash? Wave 5 of the Elliot Wave follows, where price can be predicted using three methods. First, if XRP’s price grows between 1.236% and 1.618%, the asset’s price can hit between $32 and $48. Second, if Wave 5 replicates Wave 1, the price can be between $60 and $70. Third, if there’s a 61.8% extension of the movements of Waves 1 and 3, then there’s a chance that XRP’s price can hit $100.

Imagine a scenario where owning a fraction of a luxury condominium or investing in a piece of fine art is as straightforward as a few clicks. This vision is now a reality, thanks to pioneering platforms like Qubetics , Solna, and Arbitrum (ARB). Amidst these developments, Qubetics ($TICS) emerges as the best crypto under a penny, addressing real-life challenges that its predecessors have struggled with. By focusing on the tokenization of real-world assets, Qubetics is perfectly poised to cater to the future needs of blockchain and digital finance, offering solutions that are both practical and forward-thinking. Qubetics: Revolutionizing Real-World Asset Tokenization Qubetics is at the forefront of transforming how we perceive and interact with tangible assets. Its Real-World Asset Tokenization Marketplace allows businesses, professionals, and individuals to convert physical assets—such as real estate, commodities, and intellectual property—into digital tokens on the blockchain. This process not only democratizes access to high-value investments but also introduces liquidity to traditionally illiquid markets. For instance, consider a commercial property valued at $10 million. Traditionally, investing in such an asset would require substantial capital, limiting participation to a select few. With Qubetics, this property can be tokenized into smaller units, enabling a broader audience to invest in portions that align with their financial capacity. This fractional ownership model empowers individuals to diversify their portfolios without the need for significant upfront capital. Qubetics’s crypto presale is in its 25th stage, with each $TICS token priced at $0.1074. The presale has successfully raised over $15 million, attracting more than 22,900 token holders and selling over 499 million $TICS tokens. Projections suggest that $TICS could reach $0.25 after the presale, offering a potential return on investment (ROI) of 133%. Should the token achieve a value of $10 after the mainnet launch, early participants could realize an impressive ROI of 9,207%, cementing itself as the best crypto under a penny. Solana: Pioneering AI Integration Amidst Volatility Solana has been a prominent player in the blockchain arena, renowned for its high throughput and low transaction fees. The platform’s recent endeavors to integrate AI agents signify a strategic move to enhance its ecosystem’s functionality. By enabling AI-driven automation, Solnaa aims to streamline processes such as data analysis, predictive modeling, and intelligent contract execution, thereby attracting a broader spectrum of developers and users. However, this technological advancement coincides with notable price volatility. Solana’s price has experienced significant fluctuations, reaching a high of $131.33 before entering a downtrend. This volatility has raised questions about the sustainability of its recent gains. Additionally, a proposed upgrade has sparked debates within the Solana community regarding potential centralization risks, prompting stakeholders to evaluate the implications to ensure that decentralization principles are upheld. Arbitrum (ARB): Navigating Market Dynamics and Adoption Arbitrum’s ARB token has encountered a challenging period, with its value decreasing by 27.51% over the past month. Despite this downturn, analysts anticipate a potential rebound, forecasting a 30.08% increase to approximately $0.448034 by March 18, 2025. A pivotal event on the horizon is the scheduled token unlock on March 16, 2025, which will release 92.65 million ARB tokens into circulation, equivalent to 2.1% of the existing supply and valued at around $32.60 million. This event could introduce volatility and impact ARB’s market dynamics. In a positive development, the trading platform Robinhood has added support for ARB, resulting in a 13% price surge. This listing enhances ARB’s accessibility to a broader community base, potentially influencing its liquidity and adoption. As Arbitrum continues to navigate these market dynamics, its focus remains on scaling solutions and fostering a robust ecosystem for decentralized applications. Conclusion Blockchain is no longer just about digital currencies—it’s revolutionizing real-world industries in ways that were once unimaginable. Qubetics, Solna, and Arbitrum are leading the charge, each bringing unique innovations that address different challenges in the crypto ecosystem. Qubetics is setting a new standard by tokenizing real-world assets, making high-value investments more accessible and liquid for everyone. Its presale success, raising over $15 million, signals strong interest in its potential. The future of Solna will largely depend on how well it balances decentralization with cutting-edge AI capabilities. Meanwhile, Arbitrum’s market dynamics reflect the unpredictable nature of the crypto industry. For those looking for the best crypto under a penny , Qubetics stands out as a strong contender with real-world applications and a promising presale. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What makes Qubetics different from other cryptocurrencies? Qubetics focuses on tokenizing real-world assets like real estate, commodities, and intellectual property, allowing people to invest in fractions of valuable assets. This brings liquidity to traditionally illiquid markets. Is Solana’s AI integration a game-changer? Solana’s integration of AI agents into its blockchain ecosystem is a significant development. It aims to automate transactions, improve efficiency, and attract developers. However, its price volatility and centralization concerns remain key points of discussion. How will Arbitrum’s token unlock impact its price? Arbitrum’s scheduled token unlock on March 16, 2025, will release 92.65 million ARB tokens, which may introduce volatility. However, recent adoption by Robinhood has positively impacted its market presence.

The drop comes amid large transactions involving wallets linked to FTX and Alameda Research. These moves are believed to be related to the ongoing liquidation of assets for creditor repayments. The timing of these transactions has led to increased bearish sentiment around Solana, adding to its recent price struggles. FTX and Alameda Research Transactions Contribute to Price Decline On March 13, Solana price saw a sharp price pullback, falling by 5% on the day. This decline occurred after a major transfer of Solana tokens from Alameda Research. According to Arkham Intelligence, Alameda unstaked over $23 million worth of SOL, distributing the funds across 38 different addresses. This action followed earlier signs of a sell-off from FTX-linked wallets, fueling concerns about future pressure on the asset’s price. ARKHAM ALERT: ALAMEDA ADDRESS JUST UNSTAKED $23M SOL TO 38 NEW ADDRESSES An FTX/Alameda Staking address received $22.9M SOL from a staking address unlock and has just distributed these funds to 37 addresses that have previously received SOL from this address. These addresses… pic.twitter.com/9eWuKAY4na — Arkham (@arkham) March 12, 2025 The market reaction to these movements was swift with holders becoming wary of the additional supply of SOL entering the market, fearing that further unstaking could lead to more downward price action. Arkham Intelligence pointed out that these wallets have already distributed large amounts of SOL tokens to various addresses, which could increase the available supply on exchanges. This growing sell pressure has created caution among potential buyers. Unstaking History of Solana Assets from FTX FTX’s involvement with Solana goes beyond the March 12 transaction. Since November 2023, FTX and its trading arm, Alameda Research, have unstaked roughly 8 million SOL tokens , valued at nearly $1 billion. Many of these tokens have already been sold through major exchanges like Coinbase and Binance, contributing to the downward trend in Solana’s price. The most notable of these events occurred in early March when FTX unlocked over 3 million SOL tokens, worth approximately $432 million. Despite some positive momentum in the broader market at the time, Solana’s price remained subdued. This lag in performance compared to other altcoins, such as XRP and ADA, has further underscored the pressure placed on Solana by the ongoing liquidation of assets tied to FTX. Potential for Continued SOL Price Weakness As of now, SOL price is still under the influence of FTX’s ongoing liquidation process. Market participants are concerned about the 5.5 million SOL tokens, currently valued at around $693 million, that remain under the control of FTX and Alameda. These assets are still poised to be unstaked or sold, continuing the risk of additional downward pressure on Solana’s price. Despite improving broader market conditions, such as the cooling inflation trend signaled by the latest U.S. CPI and PPI data, Solana’s potential for a price rebound appears limited. As long as these assets remain in the hands of FTX and its affiliates, traders are hesitant to accumulate Solana, fearing further sell-offs. This overhang of potential selling may prevent Solana from regaining its upward momentum in the near term. Solana Price Technical Outlook and Market Sentiment From a technical perspective, Solana’s price action remains under pressure. After briefly reclaiming the $131 mark , the SOL price faced a quick reversal as bearish sentiment took hold. The Solana price has since dipped below the $125 support, which is now viewed as a critical level for future price action. Technical analysis indicates that if Solana price fails to maintain support at these levels, further downside may be expected. Some analysts point to an Elliott Wave pattern suggesting a potential reversal at around $112. As per crypto analysts CryptoUB, this level at $127 has seen multiple rejections, suggesting it could serve as a critical point for both long and short trading strategies. “Above = longs, Below = shorts,” the analyst stated, highlighting that the price consolidation on the 4-hour chart aligns with the daily level, presenting a strong case for a short position. In addition to these technical observations, another market participant, CW8900, mentioned that there is a prominent sell wall around the $180 price point for Solana, but a solid buy wall at the current price range offers support. This setup implies that if Solana price manages to break through the falling wedge pattern and surpass the $180 sell wall, it could potentially revisit its previous high. However, until these technical levels are tested and confirmed, the bearish pressure from ongoing FTX liquidations will likely continue to weigh on the price.

According to a Bloomberg report , Kallas mentioned from the ‘sidelines’ of the Group of Seven meeting in Canada that China is “laughing on the side” over the ongoing tariff issues between the United States and European countries. China is indirectly “benefiting from the US having a trade war with Europe.” Group of Seven meeting in Canada, Source: X, kajakallas Kallas’s statements came hours after US President Donald Trump threatened to enforce 200% taxes on alcoholic drinks like wine and champagne from France or other EU countries. This was Trump’s response to the EU plan to impose tariffs on American whiskey products. The EU retaliated against the US for officially announcing tariffs on steel and aluminum . Regarding the back-and-forth tariff threats, Kallas said that the European Union wants to “keep a cool head” and avoid escalating inflation. However, she emphasized, “Of course, we are ready to act and defend our interest when we need to.” The US stock market faced a three-week major selloff, and the drop continued on Thursday as investors showed concerns about inflation due to the tariff threat. The S&P has reached its lowest in six months, leading to a correction. European-manufactured alcoholic beverages also experienced a decrease in stocks. This included LVMH, the owner of champagne house Moët & Chandon, and Veuve Clicquot, with shares down by 2.2%. Cognac by Remy Cointreau SA fell by 4.5%. Moreover, Pernod Ricard fell by 3.6%. EU’s Kaja Kallas sided with Ukraine after the Trump-Zelenskiy clash Earlier on Thursday, Putin said that he is willing to discuss Ukraine’s ceasefire with the US. However, he warned that any deal should present a long-term war resolution. Kallas responded to Putin’s comments by saying, “We have seen the ceasefires before, and Russia has never kept those agreements.” She implied that it is now up to Moscow to show goodwill. She posted strong comments on social media regarding the recent clash between Trump and Ukraine’s Zelenskiy in the White House. Kallas, who was the former Estonian prime minister, said in her post, “The free world needs a new leader” and “it’s up to us, Europeans, to take this challenge.” Ukraine is Europe! We stand by Ukraine. We will step up our support to Ukraine so that they can continue to fight back the agressor. Today, it became clear that the free world needs a new leader. It’s up to us, Europeans, to take this challenge. — Kaja Kallas (@kajakallas) February 28, 2025 She has stated multiple times that Europe’s involvement in any peace talks between Russia and Ukraine is needed. Kallas faced an unexpected diplomatic challenge when a meeting with U.S. Senator Marco Rubio was canceled at the last minute, officially due to “scheduling issues.” This was a setback in her efforts to strengthen diplomatic ties with the U.S. Despite the fact that a one-on-one meeting couldn’t be possible between the two parties, Kallas said that she had “very positive” interactions with Rubio during meeting breaks. 200% tariffs on EU alcohol will affect wineries in the US Wine sellers and importers believe Trump’s potential tariff will end the European wine market in the U.S. Ronnie Sanders, the CEO of Vine Street Imports in New Jersey, said in an AP News report , “I don’t think customers are prepared to pay two to three times more for their favorite wine or Champagne.” The president of Zachys, a fine wine retailer, Jeff Zacharia, said that 80% of his wine is European. US wine isn’t enough to match the demand; therefore, importers rely on European wines. Zacharia says, “This is just going to have a major negative impact on the whole U.S. wine industry in all aspects of it, including U.S. wineries”. According to IWSR, a global data provider related to alcohol, in 2023, 17% of the wine consumed in the United States was imported from the EU. That percentage makes up 7% of Italy and 5% of French cognac, wine, and vodka. The US Department of Agriculture reported that alcoholic beverages imported into the US during 2022 made up 14% of US agricultural imports worth $26.6 billion. In the same year, the US exported $3.9 billion worth of wine, beer, and distilled spirits. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Around 74% of the staked supply voted on proposal SIMD-228 across 910 validators, but just 43.6% voted in favor of it, with 27.4% voting against it and 3.3% abstaining, according to Dune Analytics. It needed 66.67% approval from participating votes to pass and only received 61.4%. Jain added that this was the biggest crypto governance vote ever, by both the number of participants and the participating market cap, of any ecosystem, chain or network. “This was a meaningful scaling stress test — a social, rather than technical, stress test — and the network passed despite a wide stratification of diverging opinions and interests.” “Solana SIMD-228 voter turnout was higher than every US presidential election in the last 100 years,” claimed the team behind Solana’s X account. SIMD-228 final vote count. Source: Dune SIMD-228 is a proposal to change Solana’s ( SOL ) inflation system from a fixed schedule to a dynamic, market-based model. Instead of a pre-set decrease in inflation, this new system would dynamically adjust based on staking participation. Currently, supply inflation begins at 8% annually, decreasing by 15% per year until it reaches 1.5%. The new mechanism may have reduced it by as much as 80%, according to some estimates . Solana inflation is currently 4.66%, and just 3% of the total supply is staked, according to Solana Compass. However, such high inflation can increase selling pressure, reduce SOL’s price and discourage network use. The proposed system would have adjusted inflation based on staking levels to stabilize the network and minimize unnecessary token issuance. Solana’s current inflation schedule. Source: Helius Benefits would have included increased network security due to dynamically increasing inflation if staking participation drops, reaction to real-time staking levels rather than following a fixed, inflexible schedule, and encouraging more active use of SOL in DeFi, according to Solana developer tools provider Helius. However, lower inflation could have made it harder for smaller validators to stay profitable, the proposed model increased complexity, and unexpected shifts in staking rates might have led to instability.

However, it has tanked by almost 60% in just two months as the memecoin bubble burst. Solana network revenue has also slumped over 90% since it was primarily used to mint and trade memecoins.

House Representative Gerald E. Connolly of Michigan criticized the “cryptocurrency reserve” in a March 13 letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, stating that it provides “no discernible benefit to the American people” and would instead significantly enrich the president and his donors. Connolly, who didn’t discern between the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and the Digital Asset Stockpile , said Trump’s plans would constitute “unsound fiscal policy” because it chooses certain cryptocurrencies over others via social media. Connolly said the Trump administration’s plan would also waste taxpayer dollars on what the Federal Reserve described as “the dumbest idea ever.” “No strategic need has arisen that would necessitate investment in the volatile and speculative cryptocurrency market,” Connolly, the ranking Democrat on the House committee on oversight and government reform, said in the letter. “[It] would constitute nothing more than a highly speculative taxpayer-backed hedge to provide bitcoin speculators the assurance that when the crash comes, the State will deploy this fund to rescue it.” Democrat Gerald E Connolly’s letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Source: US Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Democrats However, the White House has said that the Digital Asset Stockpile will only hold onto cryptocurrency already forfeited. At the same time, the Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve will only make acquisitions through budget-neutral strategies that won’t impact taxpayers. Connolly also said that Trump failed to consult with Congress over the Bitcoin reserve plan, let alone obtain congressional authorization to create it. Connolly also alleged there were conflicts of interest between Trump’s presidential duties and the Trump Organization’s ownership of the crypto platform World Liberty Financial, in addition to the Official Trump (TRUMP) memecoin. The Democrat referred to the TRUMP token as a “money grab” that has allowed Trump-linked entities to cash in on over $100 million worth of trading fees. This has been called Trump’s “most lucrative get-rich scheme yet,” Connolly added. Related: Bitcoin reserve may end up a ‘potent political weapon’ — Arthur Hayes Representative Maxine Waters, a Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, also criticized Trump’s memecoin on Jan. 20, referring to a rug pull while claiming the launch represented the “worst of crypto.” Connolly has asked Bessent to provide documents and communications related to the creation of a Bitcoin reserve and a complete list of steps the Trump administration has taken to avoid a conflict of interest. Connolly also asked for a list of companies in which the Treasury has crypto-related financial interests. He also asked: “Has the Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets on which you serve, which has been tasked with developing a federal regulatory framework to govern the cryptocurrency reserve, reviewed financial disclosures by the Administration officials, including but not limited to Elon Musk?” The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve will initially use cryptocurrency forfeited in federal criminal or civil cases. Meanwhile, the Digital Asset Stockpile will consist of cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin, which could include XRP ( XRP ), Solana ( SOL ), Cardano ( ADA ) and Ether ( ETH ).

The proposal explains how XRP could significantly benefit the banking system and the country’s financial health. Unlocking Trillions of Dollars The document reveals that XRP could unlock up to $1.5 trillion tied up in Nostro accounts, which are special accounts banks hold in other countries to handle international payments. In the U.S., these accounts hold about $5 trillion. By using XRP instead of the current system (SWIFT), banks could free up 30% of this capital and reinvest it into the economy. On top of that, the switch could save the banking system $7.5 billion every year in transaction fees. The proposal even suggests that some of the freed-up funds could be used to buy Bitcoin, creating a national reserve. Legal Clarity for XRP For XRP to reach its full potential, Staudinger suggests that the SEC reclassify XRP as a payment network instead of a security. This would help resolve the legal issues Ripple (the company behind XRP) is facing. Additionally, the proposal calls for the Department of Justice (DOJ) to remove any legal restrictions that prevent banks from using XRP. The proposal includes a 24-month plan for implementing XRP into the U.S. financial system. The first phase would involve securing legal clearance for XRP, followed by testing XRP in government payments, like tax refunds and Social Security. Banks would then adopt XRP in their systems, and over time, the U.S. could build a Bitcoin reserve. Fast-Tracking XRP’s Adoption To speed up the process, Staudinger proposes an accelerated timeline. A Presidential Executive Order could fast-track the legal clearance in 1-3 months. A Treasury-backed pilot program could start testing XRP in government payments within just a few months, and full adoption by banks could happen in less than a year. The plan suggests that a national Bitcoin reserve could be built within 6-12 months. The Financial Impact of XRP The proposal suggests that using XRP could save the U.S. banking system $7.5 billion a year in transaction fees and free up $1.5 trillion in capital. This money could be used to invest in Bitcoin and strengthen the U.S.’s position in the digital currency market. The document also discusses potential savings in federal payment costs, such as IRS and Social Security payments, totaling $500 billion over 10 years. XRP’s Role in the U.S. Economy Staudinger also explains that XRP’s role is different from other cryptocurrencies like Solana and Cardano. While Bitcoin would serve as a national reserve asset, XRP could be used to streamline financial transactions, both for the government and between banks. Solana and Cardano could still be useful for other government functions, but XRP would remain essential for financial transactions.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,XRP|REGULATION|BTC|FIAT|ADA,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-14 03:22:53

According to CryptoQuant’s Mar. 13 post on X, this increase surpasses its 60-day simple moving average of $3.46 billion. The stablecoin market has also exploded, rising 11% from $203.9 billion to $226.1 billion in the same time frame. Such stablecoin inflows have historically signaled the entry of new liquidity in the cryptocurrency market, frequently paving the way for Bitcoin ( BTC ) price rebounds. USDT market cap is expanding fast. More liquidity is entering crypto—a trend historically linked to higher Bitcoin prices. 60-day market cap change: $5.75B 60-day SMA: $3.46B Momentum is building. pic.twitter.com/a97yzYf2j6 — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) March 13, 2025 Santiment’s data also revealed a six-month high in Tether’s ( USDT ) on-chain activity, with over 143,000 wallets making transfers on Mar. 11 alone. Santiment argues that because previous stablecoin spikes during market downturns have preceded recoveries, this trend signals that traders might be positioning for a possible market turnaround. Many analysts believe that increasing liquidity may help a market-wide recovery, even though Bitcoin’s short-term price action is still volatile . Bitcoin remains under pressure after falling almost 30% from its $109,000 all-time in January, trading at $81,712 at the time of press. You might also like: Bitcoin dominance hits new cycle high as post-election altcoin rally fizzles out: Matrixport According to a Mar. 12 market analysis by CryptoQuant, Bitcoin might be approaching the oversold territory, which has historically preceded price recoveries. In March, the share of Bitcoin held for less than a month rose to 23%, similar to a spike in December 2024. Both times, Bitcoin’s price corrected afterward, bringing the Market Value to Realized Value ratio down to 1.8, close to its 2024 low of 1.71. The MVRV ratio helps gauge whether Bitcoin is overvalued or undervalued by comparing its market price to the average purchase price of all coins. If Bitcoin falls to the $70,000 range, the ratio could align with previous cycle lows, potentially signaling a price rebound . Market sentiment, however, remains fragile. Large Bitcoin holders, or wallets holding 100 to 1,000 BTC, have sold off more than 50,600 BTC in the last week, according to Santiment. This represents a sell-off of about $4.07 billion. https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1900288052645552573?s=46&t=nznXkss3debX8JIhNzHmzw On the brighter side, the number of Bitcoin holders is still close to its all-time high of 54.72 million, indicating that the network is still growing despite these pressures. Bitcoin’s ability to withstand selling pressure while benefitting from growing liquidity and past recovery trends will determine the market’s next course.

However, he warned that a price crash could occur before XRP breaks out of this triangle and rallies to the upside. XRP Price Hints At Symmetrical Triangle In a TradingView post, CW23 revealed that a symmetrical triangle may be forming for the XRP price. This came as he noted that XRP is bouncing off the bottom of an ascending channel, with the pinbar candle on the 4-hour chart now in upward pressure having tested the bottom. The analyst added that the crypto will probably trade in this range for a while.

The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that XRP could drop to as low as $1.70 on wave 4. Meanwhile, the asset is projected to rally to a new ATH of $5 on wave 5. Crypto analyst ElmoX also recently predicted that the XRP price could witness a massive corrective and drop below $2 before it rallies to new highs. The analyst provided a more bullish outlook for XRP, predicting it could rally to as high as $20 in this market cycle. However, he warned that the crypto would face major resistance at $2.9 on its way to a new ATH. The Altcoin Has Finalized Its Correction In an X post, crypto analyst Dark Defender stated that the XRP price has finalized the correction on the four-hour time frame. He mentioned that XRP is expected to move towards $2.42 first considering the correction structures. The analyst also affirmed that the real move to the upside will start after XRP climbs above the Ichimoku clouds. Related Reading: XRP Price Retraces Gains From Sunday Rally, This Important Support Level Could Be The Defining Factor Dark Defender highlighted $2.22 and $2.04 as the support levels to watch out for while he stated that $4.2932 and $5.8563 are the targets which the XRP price could rally to. Crypto analyst CasiTrades highlighted the importance of the altcoin holding the support levels at $2.04 and $2.11. She added that a hold above either of these levels is critical to maintaining the consolidation. Meanwhile, the analyst revealed that the next resistance levels are $2.25 and $2.70, which happens to be the next breakout level. CasiTrades also assured market participants that the price is still bullish, indicating it is still well primed to reach new highs.

The precious metal’s rally was fueled by US data which showed stagnation in wholesale inflation in February, reinforcing prospects for an eased monetary policy by the Fed. Gold price chart.

Meanwhile, US government debt attracted heavy demand, pushing 10- and 30-year Treasury yields to fresh monthly peaks. Concerns over American growth also took a toll on equities, as the S&P 500 slipped into a 10% correction on Thursday, erasing about $5 trillion in market value since its February peak. Trump’s vow to hit European wine and related products with a 200% tariff added to investor anxiety, alongside his refusal to remove newly imposed steel and aluminum tariffs or back down on reciprocal tariffs slated for April 2.

The three highlighted crypto projects have recently shown outstanding performance with their growth defying the current market downturn. XYZVerse: The Best New Meme Project You Can’t Afford to Bench! XYZ is your exclusive VIP pass to a sports-driven, meme-fueled revolution. Think of it as the MVP of the XYZVerse ecosystem, where crypto enthusiasts can score big off the growing demand for meme coins. But every revolution needs a hero—someone willing to fight against the odds and push the $XYZ token to the top. That hero is XYZepe , the masked fighter, the true believer, the relentless $XYZ holder whose mission is to bring XYZVerse to the #1 spot on CoinMarketCap. It’s about proving that underdogs can rise to greatness. With millions of sports fans ready to hit the field, the XYZVerse ecosystem is set to keep expanding—and your rewards will slam dunk through the roof! And here’s a highlight reel moment: XYZVerse has been officially recognized as the Best NEW Meme Project—a title that underscores its explosive potential in the meme coin arena. XYZ presale is your first-quarter chance to get in before the mind-blowing explosion! XYZ is set to dominate the memecoins market as memecoins emerge as the undisputed champions of the crypto space. The XYZ token is an undervalued gem currently exchanging hands at $0.003333, and expected to surge to $0.1 by the end of the presale phase. But victory doesn’t happen overnight—it takes dedication, strategy, and a fighter willing to go the distance. XYZepe knows the battle ahead, but with the community behind him, he’s taking $XYZ to legendary status. The XYZVerse team has positioned the XYZ project for success by securing listings on major decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and centralized exchanges (CEXs), while implementing audited smart contracts for strong security, and assembling an extensively vetted team. The first-mover advantage is key here—get in before the crowd storms the field, and you’ll be sitting on way bigger returns! XYZepe is fighting for glory—will you stand with him? Chainlink (LINK) price movement indicates mild bearish momentum Chainlink (LINK) continues to experience notable price volatility, recording a dip of 11.06% in the past week, and a decline of 27.64% over the past month. However, LINK’s price has surged 22.48% over the past six months, revealing a potential for long-term growth although the short-term declines suggest otherwise. According to CoinMarketCap data, LINK is currently trading between $12.03 and $16.60. LINK’s price range has maintained within its 10-day simple moving average of $13.04 but below its 100-day average of $13.96. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 53.19 suggests a neutral market stance, and the slightly negative MACD level at -0.0162 indicates a mild bearish momentum. LINK traders are observing the $19 level as the closest resistance zone, and they project a potential rise towards the second resistance zone around the $23.99 level which roughly represents a 40% increase–if the price breaks above that price. Conversely, they identify $10.27 as the closest support level and they anticipate a potential 50% drop to the second support level at $5.70 if the price falls below $10. Traders are monitoring these upper and lower price levels to form predictions on LINK’s future price movement. Cardano (ADA) price experiences heightened volatility Cardano’s ADA token has recently been experiencing persistent downward price movement with the 24.08% price drop over the last seven days indicating short-term decline. However, ADA’s surge by 5.09% in the last 14 days reveals potential for upward price movement in the long run. ADA is currently trading between $0.56 and $1.03, and traders have identified $0.40 as the nearest support level that also acts as a potential floor if the price falls below its current level. Traders also see $1.33 as the nearest resistance level and $1.80 as a second resistance zone. RSI, SMA, and MACD technical indicators jointly suggest a moderately positive future for ADA although the impact is almost negligible when considered separately. The token’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 57.84 indicates neutrality–revealing that the asset is neither being overbought nor being oversold. The 10-day and the 100-day Simple Moving Average(s) show steady growth at $0.73 and $0.75 respectively. ADA’s MACD at 0.0035 the Stochastic value of 60.33 hints at the token’s bullishness, suggesting continued price surge if ADA breaks through the upper resistance level. Conclusion Digital assets like LINK, ADA, and XYZ are emerging as projects with positive outlooks even as the market continues on a downtrend.

Ripple’s legal team is currently negotiating for better terms after a court ruling in August 2023. The ruling imposed a $125 million fine on Ripple and stopped the company from selling XRP to institutional investors. The delay in the settlement is because Ripple wants to change the terms of the court decision. Reports suggest that Ripple’s team is arguing that if the SEC is easing up on other crypto companies, Ripple should not still face penalties. Ripple believes that accepting the current terms would make them admit wrongdoing, but the SEC is now unsure if any wrongdoing actually happened. Charles Gasparino, reacting to the situation, added that one key issue the SEC is considering is whether XRP should be treated like Ethereum. Both XRP and Ethereum were sold through Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) to raise funds for their platforms. But while Ripple got sued over XRP, Ethereum wasn’t, because it became a commodity. The SEC is now debating whether XRP should also be considered a commodity like Ethereum. SCOOP: Off of @EleanorTerrett 's scoop from yesterday on the @Ripple – @SECGov settlement negotiations, one issue that is being weighed by the commission is whether $XRP continues to trade and have a utility that makes it more a commodity and not a security. I am told the… — Charles Gasparino (@CGasparino) March 13, 2025 “ What is being discussed now is the comparison between the 2 cryptos. The SEC believes ETH trades as pure commodity. They are trying to determine if the commission can make that case w $XRP,” Gasparino wrote. Pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton suggested that the SEC consider a few important points before making a final decision: A 2018 article by Giancarlo (former Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission) argued that XRP is not a security. A 2018 SEC analysis didn’t label XRP as a security or suggest enforcement actions against Ripple. Former SEC Commissioner Joe Grundfest questioned in a 2020 letter why XRP is being treated differently from Ethereum.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP|ETH|TOKEN SALE|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-14 03:49:11

Bitcoin (BTC) price slipped below $82K as of early Asian hours on Friday. Whilst, Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) prices were also trading in the red zone. However, XRP price gained alongside Ripple’s latest advancements in Dubai while TRUMP emerges as the top market gainer. Here’s a brief report consisting of the top crypto by market cap and how their prices are delivering in the market. Crypto Market Today: BTC & Alts Continue Facing Market Pressure The global crypto market lost nearly 1.3% today, as indicated by a diminished market cap of $2.68 trillion. Further, it’s notable that the market action again turned bearish despite cooling inflation in the U.S., per the latest CPI report . Traders and investors reflect a panic-stricken sentiment over risk assets at the moment, primarily due to macro heat. BTC Price Slips Below $82K As of press time, BTC price witnessed a decline of over 2% and exchanged hands at $81,998. The flagship crypto’s 24-hour low and peak were $79,931.85 and $84,158.76, respectively. Bitcoin recorded liquidations worth $78.88 million over the past day ( Coinglass data ), which may be bringing some volatility to the price. Also, BTC’s market dominance slipped by 0.51% to 60.80%, indicating that altcoins are in a better position. ETH Price Slips Marginally ETH’s price witnessed a slight 0.3% dip as of press time and closed at $1,888. The second-largest coin by market cap hit a low and a peak of $1,823.53 and $1,919.69 in the past 24 hours. Ethereum recorded only $37.27 million worth of liquidations over the past day. Simultaneously, ETH’s market dominance remained shrunk at 8.5%, indicating other altcoins leveraging gains. XRP Price Jumps 2% XRP price witnessed gains worth 2% in the past 24 hours and closed in at $2.28. The coin bottomed and peaked at $2.22 and $2.34 intraday. Intriguingly, Ripple’s XRP price soars alongside a major development in Dubai. Ripple recently secured a DFSA license, expanding in Dubai’s $277B market whilst global pushes for ETF approval continue. Solana Price Falls 1% However, SOL price also sank in tandem with the broader market trend today, down nearly 1% to $124. Its 24-hour bottom and peak were registered as $120.91 and $128.16, respectively. Solana recorded slight liquidations worth $8.61 million in the past 24 hours. Meme Crypto Market Today Simultaneously, Dogecoin (DOGE) price fell by 2% intraday and exchanged hands at $0.1680. Also, Shiba Inu (SHIB) price saw a 0.5% decline, reaching $0.00001227. Pepe Coin (PEPE) also followed, slumping 7% to $0.000006797. Top Crypto Market Gainers Today Official Trump (TRUMP) Price: $11.81 24-Hour Gains: +12% Kava (KAVA) Price: $0.4681 24-Hour Gains: +8% Sonic (S) Price: $$0.5004 24-Hour Gains: +7% Top Crypto Market Losers Today Story (IP) Price: $5.72 24-Hour Loss: -9% Ethena (ENA) Price: $0.3351 24-Hour Gains: -8% Movement (MOVE) Price: $0.4477 24-Hour Gains: -6% Overall, the crypto sector has again taken a bearish movement after sparking hope with a rising trajectory yesterday.

Fold Holdings offers Bitcoin rewards through banking services but faces challenges scaling beyond Bitcoin enthusiasts due to competitive cash-back alternatives. Fold's future business lines, like Bitcoin-based loans, are intriguing, but current revenue growth expectations seem overly optimistic. Fold's convertible note deal appears more PR-driven than beneficial, making FLD shares a 'hold' rather than a compelling investment today. With the recently announced US Strategic Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) Reserve now in the rear view mirror, it turns out that the 'big money printing bidder' that many expected to enter the Bitcoin frenzy isn't doing so any time soon. This is perhaps an underwhelming development for those who were hoping taxpayers would be pumping Maxi bags. Such is life. But, I'm of the view that the 'do-nothing' SBR is actually a good thing for Bitcoin. This network is going to have to stand on its own two feet and provide value to the world without the backstop of the very currency con that it was created to eliminate. My view is US-based companies have been given the green light to try things out. It's good news. And as investors, we can now look beyond narratives and try to find companies that are actually using this stuff. Perhaps one such company is the newly public Fold Holdings Inc. ( FLD ). Fold's Business Model Simply put; Fold Holdings offers banking and credit services to consumers, with the ability to generate Bitcoin rewards as the primary hook. During an IPO-day interview with Schwab Network in February, Fold's CEO Will Reeves described the business in this way: The way it works for Fold rewards is every time you swipe our credit card or our debit card, Fold receives income revenue from the Visa networks. We then go and convert that into Bitcoin on behalf of our users as a form of full Bitcoin rewards. As Reeves explains it, Fold's rewards are designed to appreciate in value, while competing programs from companies like airlines could see those rewards devalued. On the surface, that certainly makes some sense. But I can't help but wonder if a standard cash back rewards card will ultimately be the better product for BTC acquisition over time. Given Fold is essentially generating revenue from the same interchange that other rewards programs generate revenue from, I think scaling this business beyond a few strong Bitcoin supporters is likely going to be a challenge. Credit Card Pricing (Fold) Keep in mind, Fold's upcoming credit card will offer 1.5% back to free tier users. To get the 2% cash back reward, users have to pay $100 annually to join the Fold+ tier. There are other benefits to this tier, including the elimination of fees for users who buy, sell, or convert a direct cash deposit to Bitcoin. And frankly, users don't have to spend all that much annually on the card to make the Fold+ fee worthwhile. But when I see products like this, my natural instinct is to assess how compelling I think it is to switch from what people are already likely using. For me, I already have a cash back rewards card that pays 2% on everything without an annual fee. So if I was so inclined, I could just continue to use my Fidelity credit card, take the cash back and buy Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust ( FBTC ) shares with those rewards if I want Bitcoin exposure with cash back from my credit card. This admittedly requires an extra step and can't be withdrawn, but I don't have to open any new accounts and go through KYC/AML. I'm not sure I'm a huge fan of this business segment, to be honest. January Investor Deck, Slide 22 (Fold) That said, I do think some of Fold's longer term business lines are quite interesting. During his appearance on the Schwab Network, Reeves mentioned business loans and home ownership utilizing Bitcoin. Essentially, putting the Bitcoin to work is something that I think could conceivably make Fold more compelling as an investment, specifically because the company's 575k user base is generally higher net worth. After generating $24 million in top line revenue last year, Fold is guiding for $61.6 million for 2025. This year will also see Fold's expansion into custody and trading beyond banking and payment services. Bitcoin Holdings & Convertible Note At a market cap of $300 million, FLD trades at nearly 5x forward sales. It's clearly a growth company, and, based on that metric alone, perhaps isn't as 'overvalued' as it could be. Despite the enthusiasm for projected revenue growth, I'd be very cautious about some of these expectations: January Investor Deck, Slide 21 (Fold) Consider that 2024, a year in which Bitcoin appreciated by 135%, Fold's revenue was still below that of 2022. Boosting marketing spend up to 25% of operating budget is probably necessary to get more users into Fold's funnel. And in addition to cross-selling current users more financial services, the company appears to be joining Michael Saylor's convertible note party . FLD Bitcoin Holdings (BitcoinTreasuries.Net) After announcing a 475 Bitcoin acquisition following an early-March convertible note sale, Fold now holds 1,485 BTC on the balance sheet and is a top-20 listed company based on BTC holdings. At a BTC price of $81k, Fold's Bitcoin Treasury has a market value of $120.3 million. However, the devil is in the details and that 475 Bitcoin came following a $46.3 million security sale to SATS Credit Fund LP. The deeper specifics of the arrangement are quite interesting and not necessarily as good a deal as is perhaps believed by the company's supporters. Per Fold's 8-K earlier this month: Fold has agreed to hold the Subject Bitcoin in its treasury and may not use it for operational or any other purposes unless and until released to Fold upon conversion of the Note’s principal into Conversion Shares. Any Subject Bitcoin that is not released to Fold on or prior to the Maturity Date in connection with the issuance of Conversion Shares will be repaid to the Investor on the Maturity Date as payment of the principal outstanding under the Note. Essentially, this isn't Fold's Bitcoin. It still belongs to the convertible note investor. And while that note doesn't mature until 2030, the coupon is 7%. In order for SATS Credit Fund LP to relinquish the entirety of the BTC to Fold, the investor will be paid quarterly interest through common stock valued at $12.50 per share. Automatic conversions trigger based on the following: Principal Common Shares FLD Reference Price $4.6 million 370,000 $15 $4.6 million 370,000 $20 $4.6 million 740,000 $25 $9.3 million 740,000 $30 $9.3 million 740,000 $35 $9.3 million 740,000 $40 Source: Fold 8-K Thus, 60% of the principal requires a share price of $30 or higher for automatic conversion to trigger. While this has been presented as though it's the same playbook that has been used by Saylor, I don't see this really being the same kind of deal that MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) has been getting. Frankly, it appears - at least to me - to be more of a PR tactic since BTC held through corporate treasury has generally been getting rewarded by the market. Closing Thoughts For me, Fold is an interesting company but not one that I feel compelled to invest in today. I'm not generally a huge fan of the rewards business, and I think the convertible note is an attempt to 'sell the sizzle' through BTC Treasury optics rather than outright owned assets. I'll call FLD shares a 'hold' today.",BTC-USD|FLD,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-03-14 03:56:59

Meetings took place this week as officials looked for the best way to store and manage the nation’s crypto holdings, which include nearly 200,000 BTC, worth around $17.5 billion at today’s prices. The discussions are part of an effort to determine whether the government should self-custody its Bitcoin or use third-party firms, said the report. Treasury weighs custody options for billions in Bitcoin Anchorage’s Nathan McCauley reportedly confirmed that government officials asked detailed questions about how to properly secure Bitcoin at a national level, what role stablecoins might play in the process, and how custody decisions could affect the overall crypto market structure. “The Treasury Department is asking all the right questions,” McCauley said. “They understand that this is historic.” The Treasury is still undecided on how to store its growing Bitcoin reserves. One government official allegedly told Decrypt that there is currently no official decision on how to proceed. “They’re still figuring it out,” they said. “Right now, they’re just looking for the best way to custody the strategic reserve.” The US Marshals Service, which has long been responsible for managing seized crypto, already works with Coinbase for custody. Last year, the agency tapped Coinbase to secure large-cap crypto, though we can’t tell if that arrangement includes Bitcoin held by the Treasury. White House orders full accounting of US crypto reserves The Biden administration had a hostile approach toward crypto, with regulatory crackdowns that forced many companies to operate in uncertainty. But under President Donald Trump, the government has turned pro-crypto for the very first time ever. Trump’s executive order on the strategic Bitcoin reserve directed the Treasury and Commerce Department to explore how the US can add a ton to its Bitcoin holdings while making sure that the strategy remains budget neutral. At the White House, David Sacks, Trump’s AI and crypto czar, has been tasked with overseeing the process. Speaking to reporters last week, Sacks confirmed that a full accounting of the federal government’s Bitcoin reserves is underway. Sacks estimated the holdings at 200,000 BTC, but acknowledged that a complete audit is needed to confirm the total. “It’s a real shame that we didn’t maximize value for the American taxpayer,” he said after the EO. Sacks called the SBR a “digital Fort Knox for digital gold.” The US quick embrace of Bitcoin has caught the attention of global regulators. Speaking at a crypto conference in Singapore on Thursday, Binance CEO Richard Teng said, “We’ve gone from a period of regulatory hostility to one where the world’s largest economy is saying, ‘We want to embrace crypto.’” Teng also said he was excited about Trump ending Biden’s infamous “Operation Choke Point 2.0,” which was an effort to restrict access to banking services for crypto companies. But since Trump won, the banking climate has changed dramatically. Crypto companies that previously struggled to get banking relationships are now finding it easier to work with financial institutions. Hashkey Capital’s Deng agreed, calling the return of banking services for crypto companies one of the biggest changes under the new administration. “Banks are now more comfortable working with crypto clients,” Deng said. “That’s a huge step for the crypto and Web3 industry.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Per Busan Ilbo , K Bank will make a third attempt to go public following a board meeting held on March 12. K Bank IPO: Will Third Time Prove a Charm for Neobank? The bank first tried to launch an IPO in February 2023, before trying again in October 2024. Seoul shares open higher on overnight US gains #Kospi #Kosdaq #stocks #updates https://t.co/LnKTgL1PCF — The Korea Herald 코리아헤럴드 (@TheKoreaHerald) March 13, 2025 Following the second attempt, some South Korean media outlets appeared to point the finger at the Upbit deal, claiming that K Bank’s over-reliance on Upbit business was “to blame.” K Bank was forced to shelve its bids on both instances. However, the bank committed to making a third attempt this year, as the expiry date for its regulatory approval approaches. However, the media outlet quoted “market sources” as predicting that K Bank will struggle to get its IPO over the line once again. They opined that K Bank’s “chronic dependence” on its banking deal with Upbit could prove a key factor. The Korea Exchange’s KOSPI index performance over the past month. (Source: Google Finance) Upbit: A ‘Monopoly?’ Upbit is South Korea’s biggest crypto exchange by market share and trading volume. During the coronavirus pandemic, the K Bank-Upbit partnership proved enormously successful. South Korean law requires all fiat-trading crypto exchanges to strike deals with domestic banks. The latter provide exchange customers with social security number-verified fiat on/off ramps. During the pandemic, the parties were the only banking-exchange duo able to offer new clients the ability to crypto wallet-linked bank accounts online. At the time, other banks still required new customers to open in-person accounts in high-street branches. Since then, other banks have followed suit, and have begun allowing their customers to open crypto exchange-linked bank accounts online. But Upbit’s dominance has shown no sign of waning, with some lawmakers claiming that the exchange has become a de facto “monopoly.” Upbit trading volumes over the past 12 months. (Source: CoinGecko) Long-term Profitability The media outlet called K Bank’s “dependence” on Upbit “excessive,” adding that this was “one of the reasons” behind “poor demand forecasts.” The outlet wrote: “The fact that a significant portion of K Bank’s profits depend heavily on Upbit raises questions about its ability to sustain its profitability in the long term. Upbit accounts for about 20% of K Bank’s deposit balance. There are concerns that it could experience a ‘bank run’ if there is significant volatility in the crypto market.” The media outlet added that Upbit’s recent fiat deposit interest rate rise could also have a “negative impact on K Bank’s profitability.” Last month, another media outlet reported that several “traditional” banks are monitoring the situation at Upbit and K Bank. South Korean machinery maker DN Solutions Co. is seeking $800 million to $1 billion in an initial public offering in Seoul, people familiar with the matter said, in what could be the country’s largest such deal this year. https://t.co/3kwKCpmaBW — Bloomberg (@business) March 13, 2025 Traditional Banks Circling The duo’s current deal is due to expire in October, with several financial providers currently “weighing their options.” If so, they will likely be buoyed by recent events at Bithumb, Upbit’s closest rival. The exchange recently ditched its partnership deal with NongHyup Bank in favor of an agreement with Kookmin, South Korea’s largest banking player . The media outlet wrote that other factors could also hamper K Bank’s IPO bid. These include “sluggish stock market prices” caused by “internal and external uncertainties.” The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq closed in positive territory, the latter enjoying a muscular boost from tech and tech-adjacent momentum stocks. Intel shares soared in extended trading after the company named Lip-Bu Tan as its new CEO https://t.co/fPw4luPaFa pic.twitter.com/07BIkCpNZj — Reuters (@Reuters) March 13, 2025 K Bank previously aimed for a 4 trillion won ($ 2.75 billion) valuation in its most recent IPO bid. “Market insiders” were quoted as claiming the valuation “should be lowered by at least 1 trillion won ($687 million).” This could prove an issue, Busan Ilbo wrote. It explained that sources claim its financial investors are likely to object if it requests a lower valuation.

Others have even suggested that the incident could benefit Hyperliquid’s native HYPE token in the long run. Lessons Learned The loss occurred when a trader, identified by the wallet address 0xf3f4, opened a 175,000 ETH long position with 50 times leverage, valued at $340 million. After securing an unrealized profit of $8 million, the trader reportedly withdrew $17.09 million in margin, triggering an automatic liquidation of the remaining 160,000 ETH. Hyperliquid’s HLP vault absorbed the position at $1,915 per ETH, putting it $4 million in the red. However, some analysts remain optimistic about the platform’s future. Prominent DeFi commentator Aylo argued that stress tests, like the one Hyperliquid went through, are necessary to improve protocol design. “In this case, 1% hit on HLP was a very reasonable price to pay for the lesson learned and the apparent vulnerabilities discovered,” he said. Additionally, he noted that while HYPE remains a risky investment given prevailing market conditions, its revenue stream and market share in the perps trading space make it undervalued. According to data from DefiLlama, the token’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 7.06, which, in Aylo’s opinion, hints at a potential upside if Hyperliquid continues to grow. In the aftermath of the liquidation, HYPE lost 8.5% of its value but recovered soon after. Still, the broader market jitters seem to have caught up with it, dropping 11.4% from its price in the last 24 hours and just under 28% across the week. Ben Zhou Calls for More Risk Management Tools Bybit CEO Ben Zhou also weighed in on the event, highlighting the risks associated with high leverage on both centralized and decentralized exchanges. In a post on X, he explained how the protocol’s liquidation engine took over the massive position and cushioned its impact by lowering leverage. The crypto executive, whose company was recently on the wrong end of the largest hack in the industry’s history, suggested that DEXs must put in place stronger risk management mechanisms, including dynamic risk limits and market surveillance tools, to prevent similar occurrences in the future. The incident has prompted Hyperliquid to lower its maximum leverage for Bitcoin and Ethereum to 40x and 25x, respectively. He pointed out that HLP had been operating successfully for about two years with minimal issues and that the team has a track record of quick responses to challenges.

On Thursday, Rep. Gerald E. Connolly, the Ranking Member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent urging the department to halt all efforts to create the cryptocurrency reserve. Connolly warned that the initiative primarily serves to enrich Trump and his financial backers rather than benefiting the American public. “Such a reserve provides no discernible benefit to the American people but would significantly enrich the President and his donors,” Connolly wrote. He also criticized the plan as reckless fiscal policy, arguing that it would artificially elevate Bitcoin over other currencies through social media hype and misallocate taxpayer funds. Connolly cited a Federal Reserve official who had reportedly dismissed the idea as “the dumbest” proposal ever. NEW: RM @GerryConnolly sent a letter to @USTreasury Secretary Bessent urging the Department to cease all attempts to create a strategic cryptocurrency reserve, citing President Trump’s glaring conflicts of interest. https://t.co/EK106k15oF — Oversight Committee Democrats (@OversightDems) March 13, 2025 Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve Plan Taps Government’s Crypto Holdings Trump’s executive order, signed earlier this month, directs the federal government to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve , initially capitalized with about 200,000 Bitcoin already in the government’s possession. Additionally, the order creates the US Digital Asset Stockpile, a separate entity designed to manage other forfeited cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, XRP, Solana and Cardano. While the Treasury may explore options for managing these digital assets, it will not actively expand the stockpile beyond assets seized through legal actions. Democrat Flags Trump’s Stake in Crypto Ventures, Citing Conflict of Interest Further, Connolly’s letter raises concerns over Trump’s personal financial ties to the crypto industry, arguing that his business interests could influence federal policy in ways that serve him personally. The lawmaker specifically pointed to Trump’s stake in World Liberty Financial , a crypto-based financial services company that aims to function as a digital asset bank. Trump, who maintains a significant ownership position in the venture, stands to profit immensely if federal policy bolsters cryptocurrency values, he said. Additionally, Connolly flagged Trump’s involvement in $TRUMP, a meme-based cryptocurrency that has generated substantial revenue through trading fees. Reports suggest Trump-linked entities have already raked in as much as $100m from the token, which critics have described as his “most lucrative get-rich scheme yet.” Beyond the ethical concerns, Connolly said that Trump has moved forward with the Bitcoin reserve plan without seeking congressional input or authorization. The lawmaker argued that such an initiative, which could have far-reaching implications for financial markets and federal monetary policy, demands a thorough legislative review. As pressure mounts, the Treasury Department has yet to publicly comment on whether it will proceed with Trump’s controversial executive order.

And let’s not forget the meme coin presale structure—no stages here, just a one-of-a-kind approach where the presale is divided by the locations Arctic Pablo “travels.” Right now, the coin is in its 14th phase—Frosty Falls—with a current price of $0.000074. Early investors can expect a massive ROI of 10,694.59% when the price increases to the launch price of $0.008. With over $1.87 million raised so far, Arctic Pablo Coin shows no signs of slowing down. Don’t miss out on the opportunity to get in at this incredibly low price before it’s too late. With its deflationary burn mechanism and the buzz around its upcoming launch, Arctic Pablo Coin is shaping up to be one of the best new meme coins for massive return potential.

While these established tokens dominate DeFi, trading and payments, this emerging contender is tackling real-world financial challenges in a way no other has. With a revolutionary approach to cross-border transactions, seamless crypto-to-fiat integration and explosive presale success, this altcoin is quickly gaining traction. Could this be the next major crypto to watch in 2025? Solana ETF Filing by Franklin Templeton Sparks Optimism for 2025 Solana has experienced its share of challenges in 2025. After a 14.2% weekly decline, it is trading around $122 , still far from its January peak. Even though other blockchain networks are active, Solana is one of the most vibrant platforms. It provides resources for DeFi implementations and NFT systems. The SEC regulatory authority shows increasing interest in Solana, as Franklin Templeton filed an ETF application , which Bloomberg predicts will receive approval before 2025. Several analysts predict a competing crypto project will replace Solana as the next disruptive blockchain alternative. SOL has solidified its position as a major blockchain for speed and scalability, but this emerging project brings different innovations through its disruptive financial model. The integration of blockchain into practical applications, particularly in payment systems, leads experts to believe that this project will supersede Solana, XRP and BNB. XRP Gains 3.72% As Market Optimism Sparks Short-Term Rally XRP remains one of the key players in the crypto space. Aftermarket fluctuations, the cryptocurrency’s value has regained stability and reached $2.24 , a 3.72% increase. XRP showed swift price recovery following its previous dip below $2, reflecting positive market sentiment. The discussion of including XRP in the U.S. Digital Assets Stockpile leads analysts to believe that institutional demand will drive the asset price upwards. However, XRP’s long-term direction remains unclear because regulatory ambiguity persists. Experiments in the evolving digital asset environment have traders doubting XRP’s ability to stay in the top position. XRP maintains value from its established cross-border payment capabilities, although competition within this sector remains active. New blockchain projects have gained attention from investors because they offer swifter transactions, reduced fees and stronger institutional partnerships. BNB Sees High Liquidity But Fails To Tap Into The Remittance Market The price of Binance Coin (BNB) remains strong at around $576 , and daily trading volume remains over $2.4 billion. The Binance Smart Chain depends on BNB to power its DeFi application network, which provides quick and economically beneficial transactions. Deep market liquidity combined with institutional support enables BNB to stay at the top of its market sector. However, investor assessments of BNB’s future growth potential started changing due to centralization issues and emerging competition from new blockchain platforms. BNB faces a key business opportunity because, despite its broad adoption, it has not yet penetrated the remittance market. Emerging blockchain projects provide alternative solutions that process transactions swifter while demanding diminished fees, despite Binance’s established position in crypto trading. Rising regulatory oversight in the market has pushed investors to look for decentralized alternatives that do not need a single organization. With a new crypto contender gaining traction, analysts believe it could outshine top altcoins like BNB, Solana and even XRP. This rising star is disrupting traditional finance with real-world applications, leading many to believe it might be the next major player in the crypto industry. This New Crypto Could Outperform BNB And Reshape The Global Payments Industry Remittix (RTX) is emerging as a game-changer in the digital payments sector, with analysts predicting its potential to surpass giants like Solana, XRP and BNB. With its presale already generating massive traction at $0.0734 per token, Remittix is proving that real-world utility is what investors want. Unlike speculative assets that rely on hype, RTX focuses on bridging crypto with fiat seamlessly through its PayFi technology, enabling instant, low-cost global transactions. While blockchain leaders like Solana and BNB have established their dominance in DeFi and trading ecosystems, they haven’t made significant strides in cross-border remittances. This is where Remittix disrupts the market. By eliminating excessive fees and long transaction times that plague traditional financial systems, RTX offers a practical and scalable alternative that could see mass adoption among businesses and individuals alike. Remittix Presale Surges As Experts See It As The Next Big Crypto Crypto experts are increasingly viewing Remittix as the next major player, not just for its financial inclusivity but for its potential to reshape the payments landscape. With a well-structured ecosystem and long-term growth strategy, RTX is on track to outperform legacy blockchain networks that fail to address real-world problems. As traditional banks and fintech firms explore blockchain-based remittance solutions, Remittix stands in a prime position to lead the charge potentially making one of the top altcoins of 2025.

The daily chart shows that ADA has been facing this resistance for the last four consecutive days and is struggling to breach the 200 EMA. Current Price Momentum At press time, ADA is trading near $0.70, having registered a 3% price drop in the past 24 hours. However, during the same period, its trading volume declined by 10%, indicating reduced participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day. Cardano (ADA) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to expert technical analysis, ADA is currently near a crucial support zone at $0.68 and $0.65, while $0.75 is acts as a strong resistance level, potentially hindering further rally attempts. Based on recent price action and historical patterns, if ADA breaches the 200 EMA and closes a daily candle above the $0.75 level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 50% to reach the $1.13 mark. To achieve this target, ADA must first surpass a mild resistance level at $0.85. Source: Trading View On the other hand, if the asset falls below the $0.68 level, it could decline by 10% to reach $0.62 in the coming days. Traders’ $15 Million Worth Bait on the Long Side Despite the mixed sentiment, traders appear bullish on the asset as they are betting on the long side. Data from Coinglass reveals that traders have over-leveraged at $0.685 on the lower side, with $15 million worth of long positions. Meanwhile, $0.714 is another over-leveraged level, where traders have built $5 million worth of short positions.

Data from RWA.xyz shows that BlackRock BUIDL fund’s total assets have grown 57% in the past month following Ethena’s ( ENA ) $200 million allocation on Mar. 13. The fund, which was introduced in partnership with Securitize, exposes investors to cash, repurchase agreements, and U.S. Treasuries. BUIDL was first developed on Ethereum ( ETH ) but has since expanded to Aptos ( APT ), Arbitrum ( ARB ), Avalanche ( AVAX ), and Optimism ( OP ) using the Wormhole ( W ) bridge. Its tokenized assets are managed by custodians such as Anchorage Digital, BitGo, and Fireblocks, while cash and securities are managed by BNY Mellon. In December of last year, Ethena unveiled USDtb, a stablecoin intended to complement Ethena USDe ( USDe ), its synthetic currency. Mainly backed by BUIDL, USDtb has rapidly increased in supply. Because USDtb produces yield in contrast to conventional stablecoins, it has gained the appeal of investors seeking passive income. You might also like: MEXC invests $36M in Ethena to boost USDe adoption and expand Ethena ecosystem Beyond BlackRock and Ethena, more firms are joining the tokenized Treasury trend. Ondo ( ONDO ) Finance’s OUSG and USDY products have surged 53% in value over the past month, nearing a combined $1 billion in valuation. At the same time, major prime brokers like FalconX now accept tokenized Treasuries, including BUIDL, as collateral for leveraged trades. This shift reflects a rise in institutional trust in financial products based on blockchain technology. According to RWA.xyz data , the total tokenized Treasury market has grown rapidly, reaching $4.4 billion in assets as of Mar. 14. The industry expanded fourfold in the last year, with demand rising following the U.S. election in November. Analysts suggest that instead of holding non-yielding stablecoins, investors are increasingly moving toward direct Treasury exposure in order to access yield, which currently stands at an average of 4.28%.

Vice Chancellor Morgan Zurn granted a temporary restraining order on March 12, requested by Bitcoin miner Consensus Colocation and systems owner Stone Ridge Ventures against Mawson Hosting, which provides hosting and colocation services for Bitcoin miners. The firms have been in disagreement over alleged unpaid fees, the terms of their agreement and Consensus’ plan to relocate, allegedly leading to Mawson blocking the miner’s personnel from accessing the site. The firms have also alleged Mawson has been operating the rigs since Feb. 28 for their own gain after preventing Consensus from entering the premises. Mawson, however, claims they are allowed to use the rigs under the terms of its agreement with Consensus, and they have the right of first refusal for its relocation plans. The Bitcoin miner has been seeking injunctive relief to regain control of their equipment and prevent Mawson from using them. As part of the March 12 order, Mawson is barred from using the hashrate from the miners and will no longer be allowed to restrict Consensus’s digital and physical access to the rigs in the Midland, Pennsylvania, facility. A Delaware judge has granted a temporary restraining order barring Mawson Infrastructure Group from using the rigs at the Midland, Pennsylvania, facility. Source: Law360 The temporary restraining is in force until the matter can be heard in a preliminary injunction hearing. Mawson Infrastructure Group and Consensus Colocation did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph's request for comment. How the dispute began In a March 6 legal complaint, lawyers acting for Consensus accused Mawson of mining Bitcoin ( BTC ) with their rigs — valued at $30 million — since Feb. 28, generating daily profits of between $100,000 and $200,000 while blocking access to them both physically and through VPN access. Consensus and Stone Ridge signed a colocation agreement with Mawson in December 2023. They agreed to terminate the partnership by the end of March 2025, with a gradual reduction in capacity leading up to the deadline and a removal process scheduled to begin on March 3. Mawson argues that it was owed fees and electricity prepayments for February and March, and its colocation agreement gives it the right to redirect the hashrate of Consensus’ miners and use the proceeds to replenish the deposit. Related: US-Canada tariff flip-flops have Bitcoin miners on their toes “On its face, it was operative only prior to April 1, 2024, and only in narrow circumstances relating to the replenishment of a deposit,” lawyers acting for Consensus said in the suit. “When Mawson began redirecting the hashrate on Feb. 28, the deposit was fully paid. And in any event, Mawson has stolen hashrate worth many times more than the $17,505.45 Mawson claims, without justification, that Consensus owes in purported late fees.” Magazine: Train AI agents to make better predictions… for token rewards",,EN,0,0,BTC|MINING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-03-14 05:00:28

Investors are becoming concerned as the flagship cryptocurrency has followed the recent decline in the S&P 500. But if past performance is any indication, Bitcoin might be experiencing a resurgence. Related Reading: TRUMP Token Takedown—Did Insiders Plan The Crash? United States President Donald Trump assumed office in November for a second term, but since then, the US stock market has dropped by about 10%. Since the global recession hit the markets hard in 2009, this is the worst start to a US presidency. Although there are numerous causes for this decline, uncertainty on economic strategy and worries about inflation have contributed. In the past, it has often signaled impending volatility when the S&P 500 and Bitcoin decline simultaneously. The bear market of 2022, which saw prolonged losses, was the last time both markets fell precipitously at the same time. Not all dips, though, lead to protracted downturns. Some have led to a notable rebound, especially since the cryptocurrency’s halving cycles. How is the market reacting to Trump’s second term? Since his return, the S&P 500 has fallen 9%, marking the worst start to a presidency since 2009. Back then, a recession drove the drop. This time, uncertainty is in the driver’s seat. Let’s dive into the data 🧵👇 pic.twitter.com/A10F0qtweB — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) March 12, 2025 Bitcoin And Stocks Moving Together—For Now Bitcoin has long been known as “digital gold,” but it is now functioning more like a tech stock. According to a CryptoQuant research, Bitcoin’s price has tracked traditional markets, particularly the S&P 500. This pattern is not new. During the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, the crypto and stocks fell together before recovering later that year. But IntoTheBlock analysts found that Bitcoin’s relationship to the S&P 500 has dropped to essentially zero. This would suggest that, in line with long-term holders’ pattern, BTC is starting to migrate outside of conventional finance. Should this decoupling continue, the movement in the price of Bitcoin might rely less on changes in the stock market. Historical Trends Suggest A Recovery According to CryptoQuant, prior data shows that Bitcoin has frequently rebounded following strong corrections. For example, in 2018, Bitcoin lost approximately 80% of its value before recovering in 2019. Similarly, following the 2020 crash, Bitcoin reached fresh all-time highs in 2021. Another statistic to keep an eye on is the Coinbase Premium Index, which measures the difference in Bitcoin prices between Coinbase and Binance. When this indicator goes negative and then returns to positive territory, it has typically indicated an impending price rebound. Related Reading: $931 Million BTC On The Move: Mt.

The complaint was made against Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin and the director of the Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission, Lawrence Bengal, on March 13 in the US District Court Eastern District of Arkansas. It follows a federal court ruling last November that temporarily barred Arkansas from preventing a naturalized US citizen of Chinese descent from operating a crypto mining business. The Arkansas state rules concerned are “Rule K” and “Act 174,” which prohibits foreign-party controlled businesses in the state. Director Connor L. Kempton of the Arkansas Cryptomining Association said the vagueness of Rule K and Act 174 gives the defendants arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement powers, enabling them to grant or deny permits at their own discretion. He said the application of Rule K and Act 174 is unconstitutional and can be discriminatory based on race, alienage and national origin, among other things. Excerpt from the ACA’s complaint filed against Bengal and Griffin. Source: Court document reviewed by Cointelegraph Kempton noted that these rules were enforced against crypto mining firm Jones Eagle LLC, which is run by Qimin “Jimmy” Chen, a naturalized US citizen of Chinese origin. Kempton specifically pointed to the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution in arguing the illegality of Rule K and Act 174. Related: Russia bans crypto mining for 6 years in 10 regions The Equal Protection Clause similarly prohibits the US states from denying any person equal protection of the laws based on the person’s race, alienage or national origin. The crypto mining executive also argued that Rule K and Act 174 strip American citizens like Chen of due process rights under the 14th Amendment. Kempton also said the prohibitions and penalties imposed under Act 174 infringe on the federal government’s authority to investigate, review and take action on foreign investments. “Act 174 seeks to establish Arkansas's own foreign policy, thereby intruding upon the federal government's exclusive power to govern foreign affairs.” District Court Judge Kristine G. Baker said on Dec. 9 that the Arkansas state officials were barred from enforcing Act 174 against Jones Eagle until further notice.

She pointed to escalating trade tensions and unpredictable tariff battles as major risks, saying that his economic decisions are fueling “a level of uncertainty that we haven’t seen in a long time.” Speaking to the BBC on Thursday, Christine said that if a full-scale trade war erupts, global markets will take a severe hit. “If we were to go to a real trade war where trade would be dampened significantly, that would have severe consequences,” said Christine. “For growth around the world and for prices around the world, but particularly in the United States.” Trump’s tariff threats set off global panic Since returning to the White House, Trump has reignited his aggressive tariff agenda, rolling out new economic policies at random and crashing global markets every other day. Just this Thursday, he announced plans to impose a 200% tariff on French wine, champagne, and other European alcoholic beverages, which came after the European Union (EU) proposed a tax on American whiskey exports, a direct response to Trump’s earlier steel and aluminum tariffs that went into effect on Wednesday. During her interview , Christine made it clear that: “Any trade war is going to hurt the global economy. The initiator, the retaliator, the re-retaliator, and so on and so forth—all of that is going to hurt growth at large.” She stressed that trade conflicts always lead to economic damage, affecting some countries more than others, but ultimately ensuring that everyone loses. Christine also dismissed Trump’s claim that the EU was “formed to screw” the United States. She called the statement historically inaccurate and pointed out that the EU was actually built with American support after World War II to stabilize Europe. “To argue that it was set up to screw the United States is not just bad language, but it is an abuse of history,” Christine said to BBC. Business leaders panic as Trump’s policies create economic uncertainty As Trump’s erratic economic decisions play out, top business executives are scrambling to figure out what comes next. CEOs from IBM, Qualcomm, and HP have been making frantic calls to the White House, demanding clarity on the administration’s tariff agenda. They no longer believe they can convince Trump to reverse his trade decisions, but they are desperate for some kind of predictability. Last Monday, Trump met with top executives in the Roosevelt Room of the White House. During the closed-door discussion, tech CEOs shared concerns that the tariffs could severely damage their industries. But instead of addressing their worries, Trump told reporters afterward that the meeting focused on business investments in the US. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett has reportedly spent the past two days on the phone with the CEOs, trying to reassure them. Even some Republican lawmakers have admitted that they are not confident in Trump’s economic strategy. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent acknowledged last week that the economy needed a “detox” but avoided giving specifics. On Sunday, Trump himself admitted in a Fox News interview that his tariffs could push the economy into a recession but refused to change course. That same day, his comments caused a stock market panic, triggering a massive selloff that wiped out every gain on Wall Street since his first election in 2016. By Tuesday, Trump was downplaying concerns, saying the economy was strong, and that he doesn’t care about the stock market, because it’s a “fake economy.” But White House spokesperson Kush Desai dismissed claims of internal division, insisting that Trump’s team is united. “Every member of the Trump administration is playing from the same playbook—President Trump’s playbook—to enact an America First agenda of tariffs, tax cuts, deregulation, and the unleashing of American energy,” Desai said on Thursday.

When Will ETH Price Bounce Back,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/why-ethereum-price-is-down-when-will-eth-price-bounce-back/,"The post Why Ethereum Price is Down? When Will ETH Price Bounce Back appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As Bitcoin (BTC) price attempts to mirror gold’s parabolic move, Ethereum (ETH) price has suffered a relentless bearish outlook. The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $228 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of around $19 billion, has been trapped in a multi-week correction. Since the second inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump, Ethereum price has lost two crucial support levels, around $3,200 and $2,200. In the past three weeks, Ether’s price has dropped over 33 percent to trade at about $1,891 on Friday, March 14, during the early European trading session. Ethereum Whales Buys the Capitulation-Fear As major stock indexes, led by the S&P 500, continue to bleed amid the heightened mid-term uncertainty triggered by the U.S. tariff wars, long-term traders and institutional investors have continued to take refuge in the gold and stablecoins market. According to on-chain data from Glassnode, long-term Ether holders are in notable fear. Meanwhile, the U.S. spot Ether ETF issues are about to register the third consecutive week of cash outflow after recording a net outflow of about $73 million on Thursday. https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1900299328360747083?s=46 Is the Bottom In Yet? For the past year, Ethereum price has faced intense bearish sentiment after experiencing a heightened resistance level of around $4k. From a technical analysis standpoint, the ETH/USD is heavily oversold compared to Bitcoin. As a result, Ether’s price must rebound from the current support level to avoid further capitulation towards $1.5k in the coming weeks. Additionally, the ETH/BTC pair has been retesting a crucial support level of around 0.023 in the past week, which could incubate bullish sentiment in the near future. Silver Lining The Ethereum network remains undisputed in the decentralized financial (DeFi) space, with around $45 billion in total value locked (TVL) and over $123 billion in stablecoins market cap. In a bid to remain competitive amid the rising adoption of alternative layer one (L1) chains led by Solana (SOL), the Ethereum core developers are working on launching the Pectra upgrade soon. On Thursday, Tim Beiko, a core developer at Ethereum Foundation, announced the team will launch the third testnet dubbed Hoodi, to better prepare for the Pectra upgrade by at least mid April, 2025.",Price Analysis|Ethereum,EN,0,0,TRADING|ETH|BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-14 05:25:29

Charles Gasparino, a journalist from Fox Business, recently shared insights on the matter, referencing information from fellow journalist Eleanor Terrett. According to Gasparino, a key issue under consideration by the SEC is “whether $XRP continues to trade and have a utility that makes it more a commodity and not a security.” He further noted that the case of Ethereum (ETH) is an important reference point in these discussions. Gasparino stated, “ETH was obviously issued as an ICO; its characteristics on issuance was no different than XRP—both used to finance the buildout of a platform, yet Ripple got sued and Ethereum didn’t because $ETH had since morphed into a commodity.” SCOOP: Off of @EleanorTerrett 's scoop from yesterday on the @Ripple – @SECGov settlement negotiations, one issue that is being weighed by the commission is whether $XRP continues to trade and have a utility that makes it more a commodity and not a security. I am told the… — Charles Gasparino (@CGasparino) March 13, 2025 XRP’s Classification Compared to Ethereum The comparison between XRP and Ethereum is significant, as the SEC has already classified Ethereum as a commodity despite its initial issuance as an Initial Coin Offering (ICO). Gasparino explained that “what is being discussed now is the comparison between the two cryptos,” highlighting the SEC’s attempt to determine whether XRP could receive the same treatment as Ethereum. He added, “The SEC believe Eth trades as pure commodity. They are trying to determine if the commission can make that case w $XRP.” This development follows years of legal proceedings between Ripple and the SEC . It began in December 2020 when the commission filed a lawsuit against Ripple, alleging that the company had conducted an unregistered securities offering by selling XRP. Since then, Ripple has argued that XRP should not be considered a security, emphasizing its decentralized nature and use in cross-border transactions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Community Reactions and Market Implications An X user, Bitcoin Maxi Tears, reacted to the news by stating , “The truth is finally coming to light! $XRP has always had real utility, and now the SEC is scrambling to justify the double standard. If $ETH is a commodity, then there’s no argument. $XRP should be, too!” The user also expressed confidence that regulatory clarity would ultimately favor XRP, saying, “Regulatory clarity is inevitable, and when it happens, $XRP will be unstoppable. Utility always wins!” The broader implications of these discussions could be substantial for XRP holders and the cryptocurrency market as a whole. If XRP were officially recognized as a commodity, it could bring greater regulatory clarity and potentially remove barriers to wider adoption. However, the SEC’s final decision remains uncertain, and market participants closely monitor developments. As negotiations between Ripple and the SEC progress, the question of XRP’s classification remains a pivotal issue. The outcome could not only shape the future of XRP but also set a precedent for how other cryptocurrencies are regulated in the United States.

Meanwhile, the European Central Bank is struggling to gain public support for the digital euro, as consumers show little interest in adopting a central bank digital currency. In contrast, stablecoin adoption in Latin America is surging, with USDC and USDT becoming preferred financial tools due to high inflation and economic instability. Stablecoin Bill Faces Resistance from Bankers The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins ( GENIUS ) Act is facing resistance from US bankers and their allies in the Senate, who are concerned that stablecoins could disintermediate traditional financial institutions and erode their market share. According to an article from American Banker , the bill requires 60 votes to pass, which means that it needs support from at least seven Democratic senators alongside Republicans. This presents a bit of a challenge, as influential people like Senator Elizabeth Warren are still opposed to the legislation. Warren proposed an amendment that will prohibit tech firms from issuing stablecoins, and argued that only regulated financial institutions should have the ability to facilitate payments. She also warned that the bill disrupts the existing framework by allowing big tech and corporate entities to enter the stablecoin market. Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott, R-S.C., and committee ranking member Elizabeth Warren The rise of digital assets fundamentally altered financial dynamics by offering near-instant settlement times and much lower transaction fees. Stablecoins, in particular, demonstrated their ability to reduce the costs of cross-border payments and facilitate direct peer-to-peer transactions. The GENIUS Act was introduced by Senator Bill Hagerty on Feb. 4, and it seeks to provide a clear regulatory framework for stablecoin issuance and integration in the US financial system. The proposal attracted a lot of support from people like Federal Reserve Bank Governor Christopher Waller , who believes that non-bank entities should be allowed to issue stablecoins. Waller argues that stablecoins could enhance payment use cases, particularly in the developing world, by improving cost efficiency and accessibility. The potential benefits have not gone unnoticed in the banking sector either, with Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan recently revealing that the institution is exploring the possibility of launching its own stablecoin. Stablecoins are also getting recognition at the highest levels of government. During the first White House Crypto Summit on March 7, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent pointed out that stablecoins could play a big role in maintaining US dollar dominance. Overcollateralized stablecoin issuers are now among the largest buyers of US government debt, ranking 18th globally and surpassing countries like Germany and South Korea in their purchases. Policymakers advocating for stablecoin adoption argue that by implementing supportive regulations and promoting the global use of stablecoins, the US government can leverage them as a financial tool to absorb inflationary pressures and reinforce the dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency. However, the ongoing political battle over the GENIUS Act also proves that there is still a deep divide between traditional financial institutions looking to protect their market dominance and supporters of digital assets. ECB Struggles to Sell Digital Euro Meanwhile, European consumers have shown very little interest in adopting a central bank digital currency, which raised some concerns for the European Central Bank as it prepares for a potential rollout of the digital euro. A recent ECB working paper on consumer attitudes toward a central bank digital currency surveyed around 19,000 respondents across 11 euro-area countries, and it revealed major communication challenges that are discouraging European households from embracing the digital euro. When asked to hypothetically allocate 10,000 euros across different assets, Europeans allocated only a small portion to the digital euro. The March 12 ECB report found that Europeans strongly prefer existing payment methods and do not see a good enough reason to adopt a digital euro due to the vast selection of offline and online payment alternatives. The findings indicate that convincing consumers of the benefits of a CBDC will be a major challenge for policymakers, and will require a lot more research and targeted communication efforts. While the study suggested that introducing a digital euro will not disrupt financial stability, it shed some light on the fact that consumer habits pose a major hurdle to its adoption. Reasons for not adopting digital euro (Source: ECB ) The report also pointed out the importance of strategic education efforts to address consumer reluctance. It found that European consumers responded positively to video-based education and training, which means that clear and concise communication through short videos could help shift public perceptions. Consumers who were exposed to video explanations about the digital euro’s key features were more likely to update their views and consider adopting the new payment method compared to those who received no such information. The study was released at a time when US lawmakers are stepping up opposition to central bank digital currencies. At a House Financial Services Committee hearing on March 11, Representative Tom Emmer argued that Congress should prioritize stablecoin legislation while blocking any potential introduction of a US CBDC. Emmer described CBDCs as inherently un-American and insisted that unelected officials should not have the power to issue them. He also reintroduced the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act, which seeks to prevent future US administrations from launching a central bank digital currency. Emmer speaks during the House Financial Services Committee Hearing While resistance to CBDCs remains strong in the US, there are calls in Europe to move forward with the digital euro. Stablecoin Adoption Surges in Latin America Despite the US and Europe being hesitant to adopt stablecoins and CBDCs, stablecoin adoption in Latin America is on the rise as users increasingly turn to Circle’s USDC and Tether’s USDT for financial stability. This is according to a new report from cryptocurrency exchange Bitso. The report revealed that stablecoins accounted for 39% of total purchases on Bitso in 2024, which was a 9% increase from the previous year. The growing reliance on stablecoins is attributed to economic instability in the region, particularly high inflation and currency devaluation, making USDC and USDT preferred stores of value. Top 10 purchased cryptos on Bitso in 2024 (Source: Bitso ) While stablecoin purchases surged, Bitcoin trading on Bitso declined a lot, and dropped to 22% of total purchases from 38% in the second half of 2023. The report suggests that this shift indicates a growing preference for the hodl strategy, where investors accumulate Bitcoin for long-term gains rather than active trading. The decline in BTC purchases also coincided with the bull market of 2024, during which Bitcoin surpassed $100,000 for the first time in December. As Bitcoin buying slowed, stablecoin purchases increased, with USDC leading at 24% of total transactions, followed by USDT at 15%. Top crypto assets by country (Source: Bitso ) Argentina was the strongest market for USDT, with the stablecoin making up 50% of all crypto purchases in the country. Given Argentina’s inflation rates, stablecoins have become an essential financial tool for local users. USDC purchases accounted for 22% of the country’s total crypto transactions, while Bitcoin purchases were only 8%, the lowest among the analyzed nations. In contrast, Bitcoin was the most purchased cryptocurrency in Brazil and Mexico, where it accounted for 22% and 25% of total transactions, respectively.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|BTC|USDT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-14 05:26:45

According to a Reuters report , this stance will be finalized at a two-day meeting ending Wednesday, during which policymakers will weigh the risks of a global slowdown against recent wage and price trends that point toward progress on the central bank’s 2% inflation target. BOJ’s Ueda speaking about the 2% inflation target at an IMF event in Washington. Source: Bloomberg Television The threat of escalating trade conflicts has unnerved markets. Analysts warn that if tariffs curb U.S. demand, Japan’s exporters could see slower orders, prompting caution among Bank of Japan officials about the next rate hike. In January, the central bank raised short-term rates to 0.5%. It ended a large stimulus program around the same time. Officials said they saw signs that inflation was growing. Since then, big Japanese companies have offered robust pay hikes for a third consecutive year, aligning with the Bank’s view that sustained wage gains can keep inflation near the 2% goal. Headline inflation rose to 4% in January, which is the highest level in two years. Reuters’ sources said this will push price risks higher. They note that more businesses are passing on higher labor and raw material costs. Governor Kazuo Ueda has expressed concern in parliament about “uncertainty surrounding overseas economic developments.” Hiroki Shimazu, who is chief strategist at MCP Asset Management Japan, thinks strong wage growth and solid domestic output could justify a policy tightening in May. Yet he also cautions that another major jolt in U.S. markets could alter the Bank’s timeline. Should global equities suffer a correction, the Bank of Japan might delay its next rate move to avoid further rattling investors and threatening Japan’s improving growth. Experts think the central bank will keep rates the same for now. They want to see what happens with trade tensions before making any changes. The Bank will share new forecasts on its April 30 – May 1 meeting. These numbers will go up to fiscal 2027. This data will guide officials on another rate hike.

Judge Robert Pitman issued the judgment after Bancor DAO did not appear to defend itself following a summons that was posted on the DAO’s forum in January 2024. “Defendant Bancor DAO has failed to answer or otherwise defend itself within the time allowed, and that plaintiffs have demonstrated that failure,” wrote district court clerk Philip Delvin on March 13. The class action involves investors who claim they lost tens of millions of dollars due to the exchange’s failure to warn about liquidity issues during a 2022 withdrawal spike. Clerk’s entry of default against Bancor. Source: Law360 According to the plaintiffs, who filed the suit in May 2023, Bancor deceived investors about its impermanent loss protection mechanism for liquidity providers and also claimed its token was an unregistered security. They said Bancor’s ILP operated at a deficit and tried to cover by launching a new product, v3, which promised “some of the most competitive returns anywhere without asking users to take on any risk.” Impermanent losses occur within DeFi automated market maker models when liquidity providers deposit assets into a pool, and one of the tokens loses value against another in the pool. Bancor paused impermanent loss protection, citing “hostile” market conditions in June 2022. The plaintiffs also argued that Bancor DAO is an “unincorporated general partnership” consisting of vBNT tokenholders and could be sued in that capacity, according to Law360. The case was previously dismissed entirely because the protocol developers were not based in the United States, but was reopened in December. The plaintiffs said that the DeFi platform “does not appear to be registered in any jurisdiction and has no physical office location, mailing address, officers, directors, or appointed agents.” Bancor is an onchain liquidity protocol that enables automated, decentralized exchange across blockchains. It has $38 million in total value locked, a figure that is down 98% since its peak in May 2021, according to DeFillama. Related: Lawsuits could be catastrophic for DAOs if denied ‘limited liability’ The ruling follows precedent from a similar case where the Commodity Futures Trading Commission won a default judgment against Ooki DAO. A California federal judge also ruled in November that DAOs and their governing members can be sued in cases involving unregistered securities.

As Robinhood adds Pengu (PENGU), Pnut (PNUT), and Popcat (POPCAT) to its platform to meet growing retail demand, CZ has pushed back against claims that he sought a presidential pardon from Donald Trump. CZ Denies Seeking Trump Pardon Amidst Wall Street Journal Allegations Changpeng ” CZ ” Zhao, the former CEO of Binance, has vehemently denied allegations that he had seeked a presidential pardon from US President Donald Trump. The claims, initially published in a March 13 report by the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), suggested that CZ was exploring avenues for legal relief that could allow him to reassume an operational role at Binance or otherwise regain influence in the crypto industry. Zhao took to X shortly after the report's release to refute the claims, stating that he never discussed a business arrangement between the Trump family and Binance.US. He further denied that he had ever pursued a pardon from Trump, calling the report part of a broader political attack against the president and the cryptocurrency sector. “No felon would mind a pardon, especially being the only one in US history who was ever sentenced to prison for a single BSA [Bank Secrecy Act] charge,” Zhao wrote. “Feels like the article is motivated as an attack on the President and crypto, and the residual forces of the ‘war on crypto’ from the last administration are still at work.” Zhao’s legal troubles stem from a landmark case in which Binance reached a $4.3 billion settlement with US authorities in November 2023. As part of the agreement, Zhao pleaded guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) for failing to implement an effective anti-money laundering program at Binance. He subsequently stepped down as CEO and was sentenced to four months in prison. The plea deal also reportedly included a stipulation barring him from any operational or managerial role at Binance indefinitely. Despite serving his sentence, the implications of Zhao’s conviction continue to be a focal point of scrutiny, particularly as the regulatory landscape for crypto shifts under the new administration. While a presidential pardon from Trump would not erase Zhao’s conviction, it could potentially lift some of the legal restrictions imposed on him. According to the US Department of Justice, a pardon ”removes legal disabilities imposed because of the conviction,” meaning it could open the door for Zhao to resume certain professional activities within the cryptocurrency space. However, legal experts argue that a pardon’s impact would likely be limited. The $4.3 billion settlement agreement with US authorities—including the permanent injunction against Zhao’s involvement in Binance—may still hold, regardless of whether Trump grants him clemency. Additionally, such a move would likely face intense scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators who have sought to hold Binance accountable for its alleged past regulatory lapses. The Political and Regulatory Landscape: A Crypto Shift Under Trump? The WSJ report also speculated that Trump’s administration has been taking a markedly different approach to cryptocurrency regulation. Since Trump took office in January, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has reportedly paused multiple enforcement actions against major crypto firms, including some entities linked to those who supported his campaign or inauguration fund. One of the most notable examples is the SEC’s decision to file for a 60-day pause in its legal battle with Binance, a move that followed the departure of former SEC Chair Gary Gensler. The shift in approach has sparked speculation that Trump’s administration may be looking to ease regulatory pressures on the crypto industry. Additionally, reports suggest that the SEC may soon conclude its civil case against Ripple Labs, a long-running lawsuit that has been a defining legal battle for the crypto industry. If the SEC opts to drop its case against Ripple, it could set a precedent for further regulatory softening under Trump. While Zhao remains one of the most influential figures in the crypto world, his ability to directly participate in Binance’s operations or any major crypto firm remains uncertain. Even if Trump were to grant him a pardon, Zhao would still face scrutiny from regulators and financial institutions wary of Binance’s history of compliance issues. For Binance itself, the legal battles with US regulators remain a significant overhang. While the company has taken steps to improve its regulatory standing—including leadership changes and compliance overhauls—its future in the US market remains uncertain. Meanwhile, Zhao has hinted at a desire to remain involved in the industry in some capacity, even if not directly linked to Binance. His recent social media activity suggests that he remains deeply engaged with the broader crypto ecosystem and may seek alternative ways to contribute. Robinhood Expands Crypto Offerings with PENGU, PNUT, and POPCAT Listings Amid Rising Meme Coin Demand In other news, Robinhood has officially expanded its cryptocurrency offerings by listing three new meme coins—Pengu (PENGU), Pnut (PNUT), and Popcat (POPCAT)—as part of its aggressive push into the digital asset space. The latest listings signal a strategic shift by Robinhood, which is capitalizing on the growing retail interest in speculative crypto assets following US President Trump's election victory. As regulatory winds shift in favor of the crypto industry, exchanges are accelerating the addition of new digital assets, with meme coins emerging as a key battleground. Meme coins—initially dismissed as mere internet jokes—have evolved into a legitimate market force, attracting billions in trading volume. Dogecoin (DOGE), the sector's largest asset by market capitalization, has already been available on Robinhood, but the platform's latest expansion into lesser-known meme coins reflects a broader strategy to meet retail demand. The decision to list PENGU, PNUT, and POPCAT follows a February statement from Robinhood Crypto, which revealed a significant uptick in customer interest in meme coin trading. This customer-driven approach appears to be paying off, as Robinhood’s crypto revenues soared 700% year-over-year in early 2024. Meme coins, often fueled by online communities and social media hype, have become a major driver of speculative trading activity, particularly among retail investors looking for short-term gains. Robinhood’s Crypto Expansion and Competitive Strategy While Robinhood is traditionally known as a stock trading platform, the company has significantly ramped up its crypto-focused services over the past year. In January, it launched crypto futures trading, providing users with more advanced trading options beyond spot buying and selling. The brokerage’s latest meme coin listings indicate a direct challenge to established crypto exchanges like Coinbase and Binance.US, both of which have rapidly expanded their token listings since Trump’s election win. As crypto adoption grows, the competition among platforms to capture retail traders is intensifying, with meme coins acting as an entry point for many new investors. Robinhood’s expansion into crypto has not only been strategic but also lucrative. The platform reported record-breaking trading volumes across equities, options, and cryptocurrencies in Q4 2024, with crypto trading seeing the highest percentage growth. A crucial factor in Robinhood’s accelerated push into crypto is the changing regulatory landscape in the US. Under former SEC Chair Gensler, the agency took an aggressive stance against the crypto industry, arguing that most digital assets should be classified as securities and thus subject to strict regulation. However, following Trump’s election and the appointment of crypto-friendly regulators, the SEC’s stance on digital assets has softened considerably. In February 2024, the SEC made a landmark declaration, stating that most meme coins do not qualify as securities and, therefore, do not fall under its jurisdiction. This announcement was a stark reversal from the Biden administration’s regulatory approach, which had imposed heavy enforcement actions on crypto exchanges and platforms. Additionally, the SEC dropped an enforcement action against Robinhood in February, which had alleged that the company’s crypto trading platform violated securities laws. This decision further signaled a regulatory shift favoring innovation and crypto adoption, providing platforms like Robinhood with greater flexibility to list new assets without facing immediate legal scrutiny. With Robinhood continuing to expand its crypto services and token offerings, the platform is positioning itself as a major player in the evolving digital asset market. Meme coins, once viewed as a niche segment, are now attracting institutional attention and massive retail trading volume, with some tokens even outperforming traditional cryptocurrencies in certain market cycles. With Trump’s administration signaling pro-crypto policies, the industry could see further regulatory easing, making it easier for platforms to list new assets without fear of legal action.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE|BNB|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-14 05:30:00

While the volatility favors day traders, long-term investors are always looking for stable assets that could guarantee profits in the long term. If you are a long-term investor, Ethereum’s (ETH) volatility has made it an unreliable source of crypto trading profits for you. However, despite the choppy market, a new crypto, FXGuys ($FXG), has emerged as a worthwhile investment option due to its features and perks that promise long-term growth. Here’s why you should invest in the $FXG presale early to enjoy massive long-term gains! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Ethereum’s Volatility Spurs an Investor Shift to FXGuys Ethereum’s token has recorded huge price swings that have left investors seeking alternative investment options. In early March 2025, ETH plunged to the psychological $2,000 support, which is its 16-month low from November 2023. ETH’s price was choppy, gaining 14% on March 2, 2025, and losing 15% the next day. The increased volatility followed President Trump’s announcement of a U.S. crypto reserve, which includes Ethereum. But, the initial market excitement was short-lived. While the market dipped, a crypto analyst, Ali Martinez, said that ETH whales accumulated over $422 million worth of ETH in one day, citing data from Santiment. Meanwhile, ETH was valued at $2,196.84 on March 7, 2025, after a sloppy 3.47% price increase in the past week. Despite increased whale activity around Ethereum, investors are considering FXGuys as the smarter bet for long-term investment.

The poll revealed that 57% of the respondents thought that the economic policies have created an unsteady situation as some decisions have triggered global trade wars. 51% believed that the economy would worsen a year from now, 7 points higher than in January before the president took office. 55% of the poll’s respondents also believed that Trump’s cuts to federal programs would do more economic harm than good. The respondents also suggested that the president should try to combat the current high consumer prices. A majority of the respondents also worried that the policies would drive prices up instead of bringing them down. Trump enacted the import tariffs last week, imposing 25% tariffs on Mexican and Canadian imports and a 10% tariff on Chinese imports. Other policies include tax cuts, reductions in government spending, cuts to federal programs, mass layoffs of federal workers, and deregulation. The president’s policies have sparked uncertainty on Wall Street and in the crypto markets, leading to plunges in stocks and most digital assets. The markets also experienced major sell-offs on Monday amid the increasing fear. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.08% on Monday and is down 1.25% today. The S&P 500 dropped 2.7% on Monday and is down 1.37% today. Bitcoin dropped below $77,000 this week before recovering to above $80,000. The coin is still down over 2% today, trading at $80,280 at the time of writing.

Economist @JustinWolfers calls Trump's economic policy “chaotic” & says it could spark a recession: pic.twitter.com/dlYWag1g13 — Rosemary Church (@rosemaryCNN) March 13, 2025 Trump’s policies have raised speculations about the possibility of a recession beginning this year. Several indicators, like the higher unemployment rate in February, show the slowdown in the economy after Trump’s presidency. The February Consumer Price Index (CPI) report also revealed a 2.8% rise in inflation year-on-year. The inflation still cooled down compared to January’s 3.0% rise on an annual basis. A recession involves a sharp and significant decline in economic activity that lasts more than a few months. Groundwork Collective’s policy and advocacy chief, Alex Jacquez, reportedly mentioned that the economy’s driver depended on businesses investing and hiring and people spending. Jacquez further suggested that spending could be reduced if citizens feared for their jobs or more layoffs in the future. The CNN poll notably highlighted that respondents were cutting back on part of their spending to sustain their budget. 71% of the respondents changed the kind of groceries they used to buy in order to stay within their budget. To afford necessities, 67% of the respondents had to cut on extra spending like entertainment and extras. JPMorgan Chase has predicted a 40% chance of recession if Trump continues with his ‘extreme’ economic policies. Goldman Sachs also raised the probability of recession from 15% to 20% due to the slow house market, Trump’s tariffs, and government spending cuts. Economist Justin Wolfers further mentioned that the ‘chaotic’ Trump policies could trigger a recession. The prediction market Polymarket’s poll on ‘U.S. Recession in 2025?’ currently has a 39% vote. Consumer confidence drops significantly in February Consumer confidence plunged drastically in February, dropping to the lowest level in three and a half years, dropping from 105.3 in January to 98.3 in February. As Americans indicated anxiety about economic conditions worsening, 12-month inflation worries also rose among consumers. Consumer Confidence in February Source: Reuters FWDBONDS chief economist Christopher Rupkey commented on the dropping consumer confidence, mentioning that Americans were being more pessimistic about the future outlook. Rupkey explained that Trump’s administration was the first administration to threaten mass layoffs of federal employees. The economist also mentioned that the policies could cause a halt in the economy as soon as the first quarter of this year. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

According to SIMD Vote Status, 61.39% of voters supported the SIMD-228 governance vote, which was less than the 66.67% required for approval. With a record 74% turnout by the end of voting on Mar. 13, it was the biggest crypto governance vote ever in terms of both market value and participation. The voting pattern revealed a rift among network members despite high engagement. More than 60% of smaller validators with 500,000 Solana ( SOL ) or less voted against the proposal. Validators with greater stakes, on the other hand, overwhelmingly backed it, indicating how the proposal would have impacted various groups. The current inflation system in Solana strikes a balance between burning transaction fees and generating staking rewards. More fees are burned during periods of high network activity, which helps keep inflation under control. You might also like: Solana still leads in DEX trading volumes despite meme coin frenzy cool-off However, fewer tokens are being removed from circulation as transaction costs have declined. Meanwhile, at an inflation rate of 4.7%, staking rewards keep adding new SOL to the market. The goal of SIMD -228 was to reduce staking rewards, which would slow the growth of SOL’s supply and potentially raise its value. Under the proposal, inflation would have fallen below 1% at the current 65% staking rate. However, smaller validators would have had difficulty remaining profitable, as many of them charge little to no commission. If enough of them left the network, Solana’s decentralization could have weakened, raising concerns about long-term stability. While SIMD-228 failed, a different proposal, SIMD-123, passed with almost 75% support. This modification will enable validators to distribute rewards more transparently by allowing them to split a portion of their earnings with stakeholders via an on-chain system. According to the findings from the just concluded vote, network participants prefer changing validator incentives over lowering inflation.

Data shows that investors closed 795 deals in the U.S in AI from January to March, with blockbuster deals like Databricks' $15.3 billion round and Anthropic's $2 billion raise dominating headlines. Crypto's largest blockbuster deal, in comparison, was Abu Dhabi's MGX, with a $2 billion investment into Binance – the first institutional placement in the crypto exchange. Other deals of note include a $82 million raise from payment infrastructure company Mesh, ETF issuer Bitwise's $70 million round, and digital asset bank Sygnum's $58 million offering. Prior reporting by Pitchbook shows that AI startups attracted one-third of global VC investment in 2024, totaling $131.5 billion, with nearly a quarter of new startups being an AI company across 4,318 VC deals, compared to crypto's $4.9 billion across just 706 deals. Analysis: Has AI stolen crypto's venture dollars? Blockbuster rounds from VCs in the AI space and headline-grabbing antics, such as OpenAI's Sam Altman seeking trillions , and AI's rise from technological novelty to household name thanks to transformer models , would make one think that there's suddenly an investor preference for one over the other. Historically, all data shows that VCs have generally favored AI over crypto, with AI and machine learning attracting consistent funding that's expanded exponentially, according to Statista data , growing from $670 million in 2011 to $36 billion in 2020. There's only been one year where crypto beat AI for funding, and that comes with a caveat: narrower AI categorizations, like ABI Research 's $22.3 billion AI estimate in 2021, suggest crypto briefly outpaced AI funding during the bullish crypto cycle before AI funding surged again to over $100 billion by 2024. Keep in mind that all of this ignores crypto-native quirks like airdrops, which put fresh capital in the hands of users and, in turn, pump the token price, inflating the size of projects' treasuries. A recent report from Dragonfly found that between 2020 and 2024, the 11 largest airdrops generated $7 billion. This won't close the gap between AI and crypto, but it shows that there are more ways to get a dollar than traditional venture capital.",Markets|AI|Venture Capital|Fundraise,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|EXCHANGE|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-14 06:11:02

The bears appear set to mount pressure again as supply slowly increases. It looks weak following a 3% loss in the past hours. DOT’s daily outlook remains weak following a roller-coaster reduction in the last three months. Bears have fully taken control in the short term. The early month dump has not just caused panic and fear for the mid-term investors but has put DOT in a more bearish condition over the past few days, and from the look of things, it is not showing signs of slowing down yet. It just resumed selling after taking a day break. The weekly $3.65 low may pose a little threat as the bears slowly mount pressure. A pull-off this low could dip the price to a new multi-year low. Such a dip will bring an end to the bull season and, at the same time, trigger a long-term bearish sentiment. Another pointer to watch for this bearish signal is the steady decline in the daily volume indicator. We may see a short retracement if the bulls defend the weekly low well. But from the look of things, the bears will likely have the upper hand. DOT’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview Losing the above weekly low in the latest drops, the $3.2 level would be the next line of support to keep in mind. While it marks a five-year low, $3 is the close level in case of more dip. The $4 level has prevented the recent bulls’ pressure. If they overcome it, we may see a retracement move to the $4.7 and $5.3 resistance levels. Above it lies the $6 level.

Following a notable surge from its recent low, it appeared strong daily while undergoing a retracement. Looking back, Pepe has shed a lot of loss in the past weeks as the price broke through several support levels to reach a year low of $0.0000052 on Tuesday. This came following a recent dump from $0.0000089. Luckily for the bulls, the low level held as support after an interception and the price bounced back. Reiterating actions yesterday, they managed to close the price an inch above $0.000007 with an engulfing bullish bar. This indicates strong volume inflow in the last 48 hours, and as we can see, the price looks strong on the day despite seeing a slight rejection. If the market further shows strength, Pepe may retest the monthly high, where it initiated a dump earlier this month. Scaling through this high could activate a retracement towards $0.000014 before rolling back. A continuous rejection under this high could result in another leg down, capable of dipping the price to a new yearly low. While it remains under the bears’ radar, it currently leads the daily altcoins gains following a steady recovery since Tuesday. Pepe’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview Pushing higher, the immediate hurdles for the bulls lie at $0.000089 – marked at the monthly high. A successful surge above it should send the price to $0.0000114 and $0.0000147 in a retracement phase. If the meme coin loses grip, there’s minor support at $0.0000065, while $0.00000526 stands as support. Rolling over these supports could slip the price to $0.0000046 and $0.00000393 – all drawn from April 2024 lows. Key Resistance Levels: $0.0000089, $0.0000114, $0.0000147 Key Support Levels: $0.00000526, $0.0000046, $0.00000393 Spot Price: $0.0000071 Trend: Bearish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

This volatility has led to significant losses for many traders, driving demand for strategies that provide stable yields and liquidity. Crypto lending is gaining popularity as it enables users to keep ownership of their assets while ensuring liquidity. HTX’s “ Borrow & Earn “: High Loan Limits, Ultra-Low Interest Rates, Flexible Repayments, and Prize Pools The leading exchange HTX steps in with its innovative lending campaign “Borrow & Earn,” offering traders a way to navigate market turbulence without missing out on potential gains.

Designed as a low-risk, high-reward investment opportunity, the event helps users achieve stable returns despite market fluctuations. During the event, users who borrow USDT from the platform’s Crypto Loans Flexible product will receive a share of the 5,000,000,000 $HTX prize pool, proportional to the interest they pay.

Additionally, HTX plans to enhance its Crypto Loans offerings in Q2 2025 by introducing multi-assets collateral, aiming to improve capital efficiency and optimize the borrowing experience. Meanwhile, the platform is set to refine its interest rates, expand reward offerings, and roll out lending discount vouchers to further reduce borrowing costs. HTX’s Multiple Investment Tools Boost Resilient Portfolios in a Volatile Market Macroeconomic uncertainty and reduced investor confidence have increased risk aversion in the crypto market. In response, HTX has expanded its risk-mitigation products to balance portfolios in volatile conditions. One of its core yield-generating products, USDD Earn, has emerged as a safe-haven choice. Pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar, USDD offers a reliable hedge against market swings. The recent addition of a USDT deposit feature to USDD Flexible Earn enables seamless 1:1 swaps with a 12% APY. To capitalize on market volatility, HTX provides the Futures Grid, an automated arbitrage tool.

Some see opportunity, others see risk. But one thing is certain— BitLemons ($BLEM) is drawing attention for all the right reasons. A fully functional crypto casino with continuous revenue, its business model sets it apart from speculation-driven plays. Adding to the excitement, BitLemons is running a $1 million USDT giveaway , where a $50 investment in $BLEM tokens grants entry for a chance to win 50,000 USDT. With presale interest accelerating, will you take action before the next price jump? $BLEM is Rapidly Selling Out—What’s Driving the Surge? BitLemons operates a fully functional crypto casino that generates continuous revenue. With a platform featuring over 8,000 games from industry leaders like Evolution and Pragmatic, BitLemons is positioned at the forefront of the growing online gaming industry. Unlike many speculative tokens, $BLEM has an active business model that delivers tangible value to its investors. The project’s tokenomics structure ensures that 30% of Gross Gaming Revenue (GGR) directly benefits token holders. Half of this allocation supports strategic buybacks and burns, reducing supply over time, while the other half is distributed as staking rewards. With this model in place, BitLemons creates an ecosystem that supports sustainable long-term value. BitLemons has also secured dual security audits from SpyWolf and SolidProof, reinforcing confidence in the platform. The presale has been moving quickly, with Stage 1 selling out in just 16 days. Stage 2 is now nearly complete, with only a limited amount of $BLEM remaining before the price increases from $0.02 to $0.03. Additionally, strong speculation suggests that high-profile endorsements and influencer partnerships may soon be announced, adding even more momentum to this rapidly growing project. PI Gains Interest with Upcoming Announcements Pi Network’s PI token has seen growing attention as traders speculate on its potential Binance listing and the upcoming Pi Day announcements on March 14. The growing anticipation surrounding these developments has driven increased trading activity, with many looking to secure positions ahead of key updates. Additionally, the approaching deadline for Know Your Customer (KYC) verification and the migration of PI holdings to the mainnet has further contributed to market interest. Despite the optimism, there are factors to consider. The protocol is set to unlock 188 million PI tokens, which could introduce selling pressure into the market. While speculation is high, investors are watching closely to see whether PI can maintain its current momentum once these tokens become available. TRX Sees Uncertainty with Large Transfers TRON’s TRX token is navigating a period of uncertainty following the movement of 629,967,847 TRX—worth approximately $139.5 million—between unknown wallets. A similar large transfer of 264,073,539 TRX was also recorded, leading to speculation about whale activity and potential strategic shifts among major holders. At the moment, TRX is seeing mixed sentiment as market participants assess the impact of these transactions. Large movements like these can often signal upcoming volatility, prompting investors to remain cautious. The coming days will be crucial in determining whether TRX stabilizes or faces further shifts in price direction. $BLEM Delivers Real Results Unlike Pi Network and TRON, which are currently dealing with speculation and market-related uncertainty, BitLemons operates on a revenue-driven model that generates real, consistent earnings. Its active gaming platform provides a steady income stream, making it less dependent on market trends. The deflationary nature of its tokenomics ensures that as the platform scales, the value of $BLEM continues to grow. With a rapidly expanding community and growing adoption, BitLemons is attracting attention from both retail investors and institutional players interested in the gaming sector. As major gaming companies explore crypto integrations, BitLemons is positioning itself as a key player in this evolving landscape. With the presale nearing its next price increase, those looking to invest early have a limited window to do so before $BLEM’s valuation rises further. The current pace of adoption suggests that demand will only grow stronger in the coming weeks. The opportunity is now. Will you seize it?

A breakout of this pattern could trigger a major trend shift. The sharp bounce off the $2.35 level brought a substantial recovery in TIA’s price during last month’s trading, but it was short-lived under $4.5, and the price fell. This triggered a violent drop earlier this month, and the price rolled back amid rising supply throughout last week. This time, the $2.6 level produced support and the crypto-asset increased suddenly to $3.8 yesterday. It faced rejection and dropped to around $3.5 at the time of writing. The price remains strong, but things may go south if it continues to face rejection. A weekly close above the rejected monthly high should validate a slight shift in the trend before rallying hard to the top. Failure to close above this high could result in another drop with a potential breakdown. Another bullish indicator to pay attention to is the double-bottom pattern on the daily chart. This pattern materialized after reestablishing support above the $2.3 level. A notable break above the neckline should confirm a massive bullish move. TIA’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview Looking ahead, the $4.54 level is the key resistance to watch for a test. A clear break above it could rally the price to $5.7. The next resistance level on the way up is $7.12. While the $3.2 level serves as a pullback area, the $2.63 level continues to support the market. If these levels collapse due to bearish pressure, TIA may navigate last month’s $2.35 low with a breakdown. Key Resistance Levels: $4.54, $5.7, $7.12 Key Support Levels: $3.2, $2.63, $2.35 Spot Price: $3.57 Trend: Bullish Volatility: Low Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

After raising over $1.6 million during its presale, this decentralized e-commerce platform is now set on a clear path to becoming fully operational by the year’s end. The team behind Web3Bay isn’t just looking at short-term gains; they’re building something long-lasting and community-centered. By transitioning into a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), Web3Bay will ensure its users—not a centralized group—hold the real power. This is a significant step, transforming how people buy and sell online. The move to decentralization and user control isn’t just innovative; it’s practical. Web3Bay is creating a marketplace that puts the community in charge, offering a new way to shop securely and efficiently. Presale Momentum Sets the Stage The Web3Bay presale has been nothing short of impressive, hitting over $1.6 million and counting. With more than 400 million 3BAY tokens already sold, the marketplace is seeing strong interest from both casual buyers and bigger players. Each presale stage pushes the token price higher, now sitting at $0.005247. But there’s more excitement ahead: the planned launch price is $0.1959, giving early backers a possible return of up to 6430%. This structured presale method, spread across 28 stages, shows that Web3Bay is serious about steady growth. Every new stage bumps the price by 15%, rewarding those who got in early and creating momentum that keeps newcomers engaged. This approach isn’t just good marketing—it shows clear direction and confidence. People see Web3Bay as a serious network capable of delivering long-term results. Moving from Beta to Fully Decentralized Web3Bay isn’t content to remain just another marketplace. The next step is moving from beta into a fully decentralized system. By late 2025, Web3Bay aims to become completely decentralized, meaning the platform won’t rely on any central management team. Instead, it will run entirely through smart contracts and peer-to-peer transactions. This is a major shift from how e-commerce works today, where big companies and intermediaries typically take control. One key feature that will help Web3Bay achieve this decentralization is the integration of smart contract escrow systems. This setup protects buyers and sellers equally, ensuring trust without relying on third-party intermediaries. Additionally, the team plans to expand its payment options to include cryptocurrencies and traditional payment methods, like PayPal, to appeal to the widest possible audience. By removing middlemen and unnecessary fees, Web3Bay is creating a more affordable, fairer trading environment. DAO: Power to the Users Perhaps the most exciting part of Web3Bay’s future is its planned transition into a DAO in Q3 2025. A DAO, or Decentralized Autonomous Organization, means the platform’s users will directly control key decisions about Web3Bay’s operations, fees, upgrades, and policies. Users who hold 3BAY tokens will vote on major changes, shaping the direction of the marketplace. This user governance isn’t just symbolic; it has practical benefits. When users have a direct say in decision-making, the platform adapts faster to community needs. It becomes responsive, transparent, and more attractive for long-term growth. The DAO structure also helps build a loyal user base since people feel they have genuine control and ownership. This democratic, community-driven approach separates Web3Bay from other marketplaces, ensuring the platform’s long-term success. Future Innovations: NFTs and DeFi Integration Web3Bay’s vision goes beyond decentralization and community governance. In late 2025, the marketplace intends to expand further into NFT-based commerce, allowing people to trade goods represented by NFTs. This integration will open new business opportunities, such as selling digital goods, exclusive items, and even collectibles through verified ownership. With NFTs becoming increasingly popular, Web3Bay is tapping into a growing demand, ensuring the marketplace stays relevant. On top of NFT trading, Web3Bay will introduce decentralized finance (DeFi) features, including staking and yield farming, offering extra incentives for users to hold onto their tokens. Staking will reward token holders directly, helping them generate passive income, while DeFi services create even more reasons for people to stay engaged with the platform. These innovations reinforce Web3Bay’s long-term vision, turning a simple marketplace into a full-scale ecosystem of financial and commercial activities. A Community-Driven Future Ahead Web3Bay’s roadmap clearly signals that the team knows exactly where it’s headed. The platform’s journey from its current beta stage toward a fully operational DAO-powered marketplace by the end of 2025 highlights ambition, careful planning, and strong community focus. After a successful presale that captured significant attention, Web3Bay is now set to implement exciting developments that promise to transform how people shop online. From decentralizing control and introducing user governance through a DAO, to integrating NFTs and advanced DeFi tools, Web3Bay offers something special: a marketplace genuinely powered by its community. Users won’t just be passive participants but active decision-makers shaping the platform’s future. If Web3Bay delivers on this promise, it won’t just redefine online commerce—it’ll become the benchmark for how decentralized marketplaces should operate.

In a new post, crypto trader Justin Bennett tells his 115,900 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin’s market structure is weakening as it fails to regain $92,000 as support. “How do some people still not get it? Bitcoin closed February below $92,000. That happened. There’s nothing else to wait for. So far, March has found resistance there. As long as BTC is below $92,000 on a monthly closing basis, there’s every reason to be cautious on a macro level.” Source: Justin Bennett/X The analyst says even if Bitcoin shows some market strength this month, if it fails to close March above $92,000, the flagship digital asset remains at risk of a collapse. “Nice reclaim of BTC $81,500 + retest. US CPI (Consumer Price Index) came in lower than forecast after some hot January numbers, so most likely some relief from risk assets. I can see $88,000 and possibly a $92,000 sweep, but from there, all eyes shift back to the February breakdown I’ve discussed.” Bennett also says that based on Bitcoin’s historic correlation with the performance of stocks, a market bottom is not likely yet in for BTC as the S&P 500 is correcting. “And if the S&P monthly structure since the Great Financial Crisis (that I’ve shared 117 times) is any indication, we still have a ways to go before we can start talking about a meaningful bottom.” Source: Justin Bennett/X Bitcoin is trading for $80,916 at time of writing, down 3.2% in the last 24 hours.

However, it has temporarily stopped bearish due to a bounce and regained strength with notable gains in the past 24 hours. Since last week, KAS has seen a major move as trading levels change to the downside. This came with a monthly breakdown, and the price fell to a new multi-month low of $0.0557. It recovered briefly from the low to retest the recently broken support as resistance and now faces rejection. As a result, the price is weak, following a 2% loss. A further loss could bring selling pressure back into the market. This could later lead to another breakdown capable of plunging the price into the $0.04 range. If the price recovers higher, it may revisit the $0.09 level before losing grip. As of now, there are no signs of strong commitment from the bulls’ side, as the demand level appears low. The only condition for a trend shift lies in a significant increase above the previous monthly low. But from the looks of things, KAS has shown no signs of slowing down yet. Having said that, the overall market is still considered bearish in the mid-term. More selling actions should be expected sooner than later. KAS’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview The $0.076 resistance level is posing a threat. If the price increases above it, the $0.095 level would be the next resistance to keep an eye on, along with $0.1143. The higher levels for a trend shift are $0.135 and $0.155. Currently, the $0.0645 and $0.0557 levels are held as support. A break below it could bring us to $0.05 and potentially $0.04 in the near term.

Faced with Western sanctions, Russian oil firms are actively turning to cryptocurrencies to move money between China and India, Reuters has learned citing sources close to the matter. One of the sources say some Russian oil companies are using Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), and stablecoins like Tether ( USDT ) to smooth the conversion of Chinese yuan and Indian rupees to Russian roubles. Although more companies are using crypto, it still makes up a small part of Russia’s oil trade, they add. In one example, a Chinese buyer pays a trading company in yuan into an offshore account. Then, the middleman “converts this into crypto and transfers it to another account and from there, it’s sent to a third account in Russia and converted to roubles,” two sources explained. For one Russian oil trader, “crypto transactions are in the tens of millions of dollars per month,” a source familiar with the trader’s operations said.

In May 2024, Bloomberg also reported that Russia’s two largest unsanctioned metal producers began using Tether’s USDT stablecoin for cross-border transactions with Chinese clients and suppliers. The shift came after the U.S. Treasury had warned it would impose secondary sanctions on financial institutions aiding sanctions evasion. Executives at the unnamed companies explained that some transactions are processed through Hong Kong, although the total trade volume is unclear.

This new development is coming off the back of the abrupt closure of Pump.fun’s controversial livestreaming feature, which was initially launched in mid-2024. The memecoin launchpad platform is a major driver of traffic and liquidity to the Solana blockchain. introducing DMs on PUMP FUN SEND DMs, CREATE group chats, SEAMLESSLY share coins & much more! EXCLUSIVELY on the pump fun app download NOW 👇 pic.twitter.com/8YKK8DpGrM — pump.fun (@pumpdotfun) March 13, 2025 The rise and fall of Pump.fun’s livestream feature Pump.fun launched its livestream feature to help creators court awareness and engagement around their memecoins. Creators could launch meme tokens and then use livestreaming events to get more users to buy the tokens and drive the prices up in real-time. This concept isn’t exactly novel as e-commerce platforms in countries like China employ similar sales strategies to better demo their products. However, the reality was different from the vision thanks to a lack of content moderation, which is not exactly a staple of the crypto industry. The livestream feature became an arena for harmful content, with users streaming racist, pornographic, and other abusive materials, such as animal abuse and threats to commit bodily harm to themselves and their family members, all in a bid to get more users to buy their memecoins. The series of events caused widespread backlash and forced one of Pump.fun’s founders, Alon Cohen, to announce that it will shut down the livestream feature while they find modern ways to tackle video content moderation. Messaging to the rescue? Following the unfortunate end of the livestream feature, it seems Pump.fun has shifted its focus to DMs and group messaging as one of the tools for community engagement on the platform. It’s also a welcome development as it gives the platform more control over content moderation. However, it doesn’t totally insulate the feature from being abused again. There’s the existential tendency of people trying to do extreme things to court attention for their memecoin launches. It’s just too early to determine how the messaging features will be used. According to speculators, this may also be a chance for Pump.fun to redeem itself from the livestreaming debacle and also get more activity on the platform which has recorded a decline in activity compared to it’s meteoric rise last year. Upon the announcement of the indefinite closure of its livestreaming feature, activities on Pump.fun reportedly dropped by 50% late last year. It saw a temporary uptick earlier in January, but it has been down badly after memecoins such as LIBRA and TRUMP caused tremendous losses to holders despite being heavily supported by leading political figures like Javier Milei and Donald Trump, respectively. Pump.fun has had an eventful year in the memecoin space Despite recent setbacks, Pump.fun remains a dominant player in the memecoin market. Pump.fun launched with lots of promise in January of 2024, and it was responsible for over 70% of the memecoins launched on the Solana blockchain at some point last year. For its creators, Pump.fun has been a lucrative venture as they get to charge a 1% trading fee as well as SOL charges for memecoins that satisfy its criteria to move into larger exchanges. The memecoin launchpad also rakes in large amounts in trading fees, reaching as high as $15 million at its peak. However, Pump.fun’s journey hasn’t exactly been smooth this year as it currently faces a series of class action lawsuits in the United States. In December 2024, the United Kingdom’s financial authority, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), warned the public that Pump.fun isn’t authorized to operate in the country, leading to Pump.fun restricting access to its platform to users in the UK. The restriction means UK users still cannot access the memecoin launchpad and its new messaging feature. Adding to Pump.fun’s troubles, its official X account was recently hacked, with attackers promoting fraudulent tokens. As expected, the new messaging feature was received with mixed feelings by Pump.fun’s community. Some users are skeptical, while others are more receptive. One user on X (@0xKaco) said, “Pump fun has always been a social platform 1st and a trading platform 2nd,” with another user highlighting concerns from the livestream mishap and asking if no one will be harassed or sent slurs for selling. Despite all the speculations, some users are already testing the new feature and announcing their new group chats on X. The coming months will be a determinant for many users and speculators of the platform if the new feature is a better upgrade or carry on with the legacy of the livestreaming feature.

Journalist and host of the America In Crypto podcast Eleanor Terrett recently revealed that the only hurdles left are the $125 million penalty and the permanent injunction from the court that prevents Ripple from selling tokens to institutional investors. However, Yassin Mobarak, founder of Dizer Capital, believes that Ripple’s primary concern is the permanent injunction, as the company can easily pay the $125 million penalty. This restriction from the injunction has significant implications for Ripple’s business operations. Cancelling the $125M Ripple fine is not the problem. Ripple can pay that without blinking. The issue is the injunction preventing Ripple from selling XRP to institutional investors. That is the big deal. Ripple is negotiating to have that injunction removed somehow. I'm not a… https://t.co/pLloUkjw2K — Yassin Mobarak (@Dizer_YM) March 12, 2025 The SEC has spent the past few weeks dismissing other crypto-related lawsuits and investigations. Mobarak believes the lawsuit resolution is being delayed because the company is negotiating the removal of this injunction. He called on prominent legal experts in the crypto space to explain better, as he is unsure how Ripple can achieve this goal. Legal Experts Weigh In Legal experts have provided insight into ways Ripple might address this issue. Attorney Bill Morgan clarified that Ripple is not attempting to remove the injunction outright but is negotiating for the SEC to consent to a motion requesting the judge to vacate it. However, this outcome is not guaranteed even with the SEC’s consent. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 MetaLawMan, another well-respected attorney, also recently weighed in on Ripple’s strategy, suggesting that the company might negotiate with the SEC to alter or remove parts of Judge Torres’ decision. While the ruling was favorable for XRP holders, the findings of securities law violations and the injunction created complications for Ripple. MetaLawMan speculated that the SEC would have accepted a straightforward settlement involving both parties dismissing their appeals and Ripple paying the penalty. However, Ripple appears to be pushing for a better deal. Attorney Jeremy Hogan also reacted to the potential resolution after Terrett’s initial report. He noted that the case could conclude soon if Ripple and the SEC reach a private settlement that does not require court approval. However, he questioned whether the SEC would agree to a settlement that effectively bypasses the injunction. He proposed an alternative scenario where the SEC might allow Ripple a regulatory path to register sales of XRP to institutional investors. The Path Forward The resolution of the Ripple lawsuit depends on whether the SEC is willing to negotiate the injunction terms. If the SEC maintains its position, Ripple’s options become limited. However, the regulator has displayed a more pro-crypto stance since the change in administration, and the final decision to vacate the injunction may lie in the hands of the court.

However, this could all be part of a “short term pain” masterplan in a strategy that aims to lower inflation and refinance around $9 trillion of US debt by allowing market weakness, reported the Kobeissi Letter. “We have seen over $5 trillion erased from US stocks with the goal of lowering rates. Will it work?” Planned Market Turmoil The administration appears unified in this approach, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stating, “Stock market not driving outcomes for this admin,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent saying he’s “Not concerned about a little volatility,” and Trump acknowledging a “period of transition” that will “take a little time.” Elon Musk also appears to support this strategy, saying Tesla stock “will be fine long-term” despite TSLA tanking 40% since the beginning of this year. It’s very clear what’s happening: President Trump now believes “short term pain” is his ONLY option to lower inflation and refinance $9+ trillion of US debt. We have seen over -$5 TRILLION erased from US stocks with the goal of LOWERING rates. Will it work? (a thread) pic.twitter.com/QlQYU65AZT — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) March 13, 2025 This intentional tanking of markets may be driven by several factors, such as a record government deficit reaching $1.15 trillion in February, a desire to lower oil prices, plans to reduce the US trade deficit through tariffs, and a goal to cut government jobs that have accounted for recent job growth. Trump’s economic weakness plans appear to have several goals, including lowering inflation (currently 2.8%), oil prices, and interest rates. He also aims to reduce deficit spending, trade deficits, and government inefficiency. Economist Joe Foudy told Newsweek that this is a “political recognition” before adding: “If the stock market responds negatively or if we see weaker economic data, Trump needs to get ahead of the narrative. By framing short-term economic downturns as necessary for long-term gains, he is managing expectations.” “Normally, the Federal Reserve would lower interest rates to stabilize the economy. But if tariffs drive up prices, policymakers may hesitate, fearing rate cuts could fuel inflation,” commented NYU economics professor Lawrence White. Trump is clearly telling his plans. He doesn’t care about the stock market or the crypto market. All he cares about is that interest rates to go down which will definitely cause some short-term pain. This reminds me of Q4 2021 when Powell was calling for higher rates and… pic.twitter.com/b6SRvNwRf8 — Cas Abbé (@cas_abbe) March 13, 2025 Impacts on Crypto Markets This “short-term pain” approach could lead to significant market volatility across all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. As traditional markets experience downturns, investors may reduce exposure to high-risk assets like crypto to cover losses elsewhere or move to cash positions, more so if interest rates increase again. Market instability could also lead to liquidity issues in crypto markets, potentially causing exaggerated price movements. Crypto might continue following stock market trends in the short term. The market has already declined by around 25% over the past couple of months as $1 trillion has left the space. In the long term, lowering interest rates could eventually benefit it as an alternative investment when cheap money looks for yields. Moreover, economic instability might accelerate crypto regulation efforts, which could provide clarity and potentially attract more institutional adoption. If the strategy affects dollar strength, which has weakened recently , cryptocurrencies could benefit as alternatives to fiat currencies. Over time, crypto markets could gradually decouple from traditional markets as the sector matures and establishes its own economic cycles, however there is likely to be more pain before any gains.

Analysts view the blockchain with skepticism because of its unreliable stability according to The DeFi Report founder Michael Nadeau who calls it a “house of cards.” The fees from Solana wallets during the last thirty days exceeded $74 million but 95% of this revenue originated from 1.26% of user wallets which primarily exchanged meme coins. Silence about its sustainable future exists thanks to this distribution model. Market interest in the new altcoin Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is intensifying because its presale demand reminds observers of Dogecoin’s massive growth in 2021. Solana’s Fee Boom Masks Fragility The substantial fee increases that Solana experienced due to the PumpFun platform conflict with fundamental technical deficiencies of the network. The network statistics demonstrate that speculation with meme coins dominates the system instead of practical utility functions. The daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) now remains below 50 thus demonstrating decreasing purchase interest. A failure to maintain $142 value might start a liquidation cascade that could drive SOL towards $110. According to Franklin Templeton Solana maintains stable operation and decentralized finance features yet doubts remain about its capacity to expand since its user base is limited and market demand is unpredictable. Mutuum Finance Presale Gains Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) launches its third presale stage as Solana experiences volatility. This is because the platform has amassed $3.2 million from 5,500 investors. Future investors will profit through the upcoming token price increase to $0.025 because the current price stands at $0.02. Public anticipation rises about an exchange listing of MUTM tokens priced at $0.06 during Phase 4 as Phase 3 approaches its capacity fast. This upcoming price represents a potential 200% increase from its current level. Phase 3 participants stand to gain 17400% in returns once Mutuum Finance reaches its projected price of $3.50 after launch. Solana’s speculative activity differs from Mutuum Finance because it utilizes decentralized lending and borrowing and mtTokens serve as collateralized deposit representations. The framework creates self-sustaining market demand through two mechanisms: first it accumulates interest from token holders then employs a token buyback program to keep lowering prices and giving tokens to staking participants. Sustainable Growth Drives Investor Confidence The presale structure of Mutuum Finance uses measures that make it available to a wide range of investors while also ensuring constant expansion. During Phase 3 investors can get access to MTokens at discounted prices which then cause price increments similar to previous DeFi launches. To encourage investment participation the project provides a $100,000 giveaway that awards $10,000 rewards to ten participants. Analysts make a direct connection between MUTM’s development prospects and Dogecoin’s projected 2025 market pattern because of its well-balanced economic system and practical application in the real world which creates exponential growth conditions. Timing the Market Shift The network stability issues of Solana create an opportunity for investors to consider the calculated market proposal known as Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The continuing momentum of MUTM presale demonstrates the market understanding of its secure lending protocols that generate revenue from tokenomics. The Phase 3 release of MUTM presents investors with an opportunity to enter before market values rise since the project provides stability through turbulent market periods. The increasing challenges facing Solana has accelerated the trend to adopt projects which provide both utility and yield.

The mid-cap dog-themed memecoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $7.2 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of about $169 million, has dropped more than 22 percent in the past four weeks to trade about $0.00001239 on Friday, March 14, during the mid-London trading session. As the largest memecoin on the Ethereum network, Shiba Inu price has moved in tandem with Ethereum. Consequently, a potential V-shaped reversal for Ether in the near future could directly impact Shiba Inu price action and the wider altcoin market. Shiba Inu Chart Insights From a technical analysis standpoint, Shiba Inu price is currently retesting a crucial support range between $0.0000128 and $0.00001, which was established in the last year. Additionally, SHIB price has been retesting a crucial support weekly trendline, which must hold to invalidate further market correction. In case of a sudden market reversal, SHIB price will be aiming for the next supply zone between $0.000021 and $0.000025. Favoring Fundamentals Shiba Inu has, over the years of existence, evolved to a utility-based memecoin through the Shibarium layer two (L2) ecosystem. The Shibarium ecosystem has grown to more than a dozen DeFi protocols, with a total value locked of about $1.71M at the time of this writing.As a result, the SHIB token has attracted more than 1.4 million on-chain holders, who have helped increase the network’s overall burn rate.

However, with total assets under management at $115 billion, most funds remain intact despite Bitcoin’s 25% price drop. According to Seyffart, this resilience is comparable to traditional U.S. stock ETFs, where long-term investors don’t panic sell during market downturns but instead keep buying.

Analysts say the recent outflows are a classic case of “buy the rumor, sell the news.” The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve initiative was first mentioned by Trump in July 2024, which led to speculations and more investors buying Bitcoin. By the time the official announcement was made at the Crypto Summit, the market had already priced it in, leading to a sell-off.

CryptoQuant contributor Darkfost noted that Bitcoin demand has fallen sharply since December. He pointed to a drop in the 30-day simple moving average of apparent demand, which compares new supply to BTC inactive for over a year. This decline indicates fewer active buyers and a more cautious market. https://twitter.com/darkfost_coc/status/1900253428846387242?s=46&t=nznXkss3debX8JIhNzHmzw Another concerning trend was revealed by the data analytics platform Alphractal on a Mar. 12 X post . The Bitcoin Sharpe Ratio, which determines risk-adjusted returns, has been declining since March 2024. Even as Bitcoin hit all-time highs above $100,000, the ratio showed weakness, indicating rising risk per unit of return. The decline can be attributed to macroeconomic uncertainty, increased volatility, and slowing short-term returns. Returns become less predictable and more volatile when the Sharpe Ratio declines, indicating increased market volatility and possible price corrections . Additionally, Santiment’s data indicates that large Bitcoin holders are selling. In the past week, whale wallets, or those with 100-1,000 BTC, sold over 50,000 BTC totaling approximately $4.07 billion.

To illustrate, institutional investors have remained active holders of cryptocurrencies, most investing in Bitcoin ETFs. Despite this, they have negatively impacted the crypto market. Ark Invest sold roughly $9 million of its BTC ETFs invested in the company. This aligns with a broader institutional selling trend. Factors contributing to the selling pressure include the declining performance of the US stock market, inflation concerns, and uncertainties in trade policies. Bitcoin suffers a pullback amid trade war concerns Bitcoin holds the majority share compared to all other cryptocurrencies combined. According to CoinMarketCap , Bitcoin has 61% market dominance. Therefore, most long-term investors view Bitcoin as an essential trading asset. For instance, Wood remains a supporter of Bitcoin. She previously forecasted an increase in BTC price to $1 million per coin by 2030. However, the trading war brought about by institutional buying and selling of cryptocurrency contributes to Bitcoin price fluctuation, diminishing its strength. Nevertheless, Bitcoin’s strength has diminished due to the trade war’s impact, which makes the asset still bearish. Bitcoin’s price traded in the $79,000 range before rising back to the $81,000 mark but faced resistance at the $83,700 level. In case the selling pressure continues, BTC’s price may further decline towards the $75,000 support level. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Data from Bloomberg shows that a massive 95% of investors still continue to hold the ETFs without any major concerns. Bitcoin ETF Holders Have Diamond Hands Bloomberg’s ETF strategist James Seyffart recently shared some key details stating that the BTC ETF inflows have declined slightly to $35 billion, a bit down from the peak of $40 billion. This represents over 95% of investor cash holding firm, even as the BTC price faced a sharp 25% downturn. Big institutional players like Goldman Sachs also have more than $1.5 billion exposure to Bitcoin ETFs. Source: Bloomberg Intelligence Currently, the US Bitcoin ETFs manage a total of $115 billion in assets under management, with the data underscoring the resilience of investors and big players who have invested in this product. Interestingly, since mid-February, there have been massive outflows in BTC ETFs , with nearly $5 billion outflows from the peak. As per the data from Farside Investors , the total outflows on March 13 were $135 million, with only the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) seeing net inflows of $45.7 million. BTC Price Selling Pressure Continues Amid the macro uncertainty and the Trump tariff war, Bitcoin and the broader crypto market have come under severe selling pressure. Following the US CPI data release on Wednesday and cooling inflation, the BTC price made a brief surge above the crucial resistance of $84,000, however, failed to hold above the crucial levels. As of press time, Bitcoin is trading 1.56% down at $81,953 levels, with daily trading volume dropping by 22% under $30 billion. The Coinglass data shows that the 24-hour liquidations have shot up to $75 million, of which $52 million is in long liquidations. Ki Young Ju, CEO of on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant, has commented on the current state of Bitcoin demand, noting that it appears “stuck” at present. Despite the sluggish activity, Ju emphasized that it is “too early to call it a bear market”.

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $4.66 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $14.78. Tezos started out really strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Following the November 5 U.S. elections and the emergence of ex-president Donald Trump, crypto markets have responded positively, with Bitcoin prices moving above the $100k mark. Tezos also responded similarly, hitting a high of $1.85. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos survive?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $0.685 Market cap $712,222,336.23 Trading volume $27,650,012.26 Circulating supply 1,034,511,359.63 XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3146 on December 7, 2018 24-hour low $0.6633 24-hour high $0.6964 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 9.64% 50-day SMA $0.8925 14-Day RSI 36.28 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 45 (Fear) Green days 12/30 (47%) 200-day SMA $0.9677 Tezos price analysis: XTZ eyes $0.70 amid broader bearish market TL;DR Breakdown XTZ has gained 1.33% in the last 24 hours. The coin’s immediate support is at $0.676. XTZ’s resistance is around $0.700. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart: XTZ maintains $0.650 support – upside next? The daily price analysis of the Tezos (XTZ) coin on March 14 shows a slight increase in the last trading hours. XTZ’s value is currently around $0.685, though below the 20-day SMA. XTZ’s immediate support stands at $0.650. XTZ maintains $0.650 support – upside next? The MACD indicator also shows some slight recovery, with green bar charts emerging, indicating a possible market resurgence. The RSI (37.57) reflects a market approaching oversold conditions, suggesting buying opportunities and potential upside reversal. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart: XTZ might fall back to $0.676 in the short-term The 4-hour chart shows a slight pullback towards the middle Bollinger band at $0.676, which acts as immediate support. The Bollinger Bands are tightening, suggesting reduced potential volatility in the short term and possible price consolidation. XTZ might fall back to $0.676 in the short-term The CMF indicator at 0.15 shows that the buying pressure is marginally stronger than the selling pressure, supporting the chances of an upside. Meanwhile, the MFI suggests a mild cash outflow and possible short-term pullback towards $0.676. If buyers push XTZ above $0.70, it might move toward higher resistance levels. Tezos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.8805 SELL SMA 5 $0.8114 SELL SMA 10 $0.8136 SELL SMA 21 $0.8091 SELL SMA 50 $0.8925 SELL SMA 100 $1.1330 SELL SMA 200 $0.9677 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.8090 SELL EMA 5 $0.8863 SELL EMA 10 $1.0216 SELL EMA 21 $1.1611 SELL EMA 50 $1.2251 SELL EMA 100 $1.1369 SELL EMA 200 $1.0237 SELL What to expect from XTZ price analysis next? XTZ’s price is currently in a critical phase. Traders should expect either a continuation above $0.700, a potential pullback to the middle band at $0.676, or possibly even a deeper retracement if bearish sentiment takes hold. A push above $0.700 could take XTZ past the 20-day SMA. Is Tezos a long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs – so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your own research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Why is Tezos up? Tezos (XTZ) is up today after bouncing off support at $0.662, a move spurred by a slight capital inflow. The coin is now trading at around $0.68. XTZ 1-hour price chart Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $2 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance and decentralized applications.

Tezos historic price sentiment Tezos price history ⏐ Source: Coinmarketcap Tezos mainnet went live in September 2018 and immediately gained popularity for dealing with the environmental impact of blockchain technologies at that time with its PoS model. XTZ’s price peaked during the bullish cycle of 2021, reaching above $9.0. After 4 April 2022, XTZ’s price plummeted below $4.0; by 9 May, it had sharply fallen below the $2 mark. XTZ surged to about $1 at the beginning of December 2022, but the bears reclaimed the market by the end of the month, resulting in a drop to $0.73. The coin made some recovery in 2023, averaging a market price of $0.8. Despite the partnership milestones achieved, Tezos (XTZ) had a largely bearish 2024. The coin reached a high of $1.4 in April but lost about 60% by August. The bulls soon entered the market, and XTZ saw renewed buyer interest, which resulted in a peak price of $0.7015 in September and $1.856 in November. The surge extended into December—Tezos XTZ recorded a maximum price of $1.909. Price corrections followed thereafter, and the coin closed the year at $1.286. In January 2025, XTZ reached a maximum price of $1.49, but in February, it lost momentum, averaging $0.72 per unit. After a failed attempt at breaking above $0.8 in early March, XTZ is currently trading around $0.6633 – $0.6964.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,TRADING|XTZ|BUSINESS|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|FORKS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-03-14 07:45:57

While a new name joins the altcoin ETF race every day, BlackRock has not applied for an ETF for any altcoin other than BTC and ETH to date. While BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, is expected to apply specifically for an XRP ETF, ETF analyst Nate Geraci said that BlackRock is likely to apply for Solana and XRP ETFs. The ETF Store CEO Nate Geraci shared on his X account that he expects BlackRock to apply for Solana and XRP ETFs soon. Stating that he believes the SOL ETF application may be realized soon, Geraci stated that the XRP ETF will be made after the SEC case is resolved. “I'm ready to announce my official prediction… BlackRock will file for both Solana and XRP ETFs. The Solana filing could happen at any time. The XRP filing will happen once the SEC case is concluded. BlackRock currently leads both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs by asset… “I don't think BlackRock will allow other companies to come in and launch ETFs in SOL and XRP, which are in the top 5 altcoins.” The possibility that BlackRock will file for SOL and XRP spot ETFs coincides with the broader crypto expansion following the launch of iShares Bitcoin (IBIT) and Ethereum (ETHA) ETFs, which have seen large institutional inflows. Investment giant Franklin Templeton became the latest major player to enter the XRP ETF race earlier this week. https://twitter.com/NateGeraci/status/1900345863739732240 *This is not investment advice.

However, even as anticipation builds within the community over the impact that this day will have on Pi coin price, several concerns remain that could impact token holders. This article explores the four things that Pi Network token holders need to worry about on this pivotal date. Things Pi Network Token Holders Should Worry About on Pi Day Pi Day is an event that is celebrated on March 14 every year and will coincide with the project’s sixth anniversary. During this event, Pi Network token holders are awaiting a flurry of announcements that could spike the level of market interest in the altcoin. Pi Coin has made waves since its launch, with its market cap surging to more than $11 billion. Top exchanges like OKX and Bitget have listed Pi Coin. There has also been notable Pi Coin adoption from a top US real estate company. Pi Day is set to unlock another stage for the project. This day is also the deadline for mainnet migration. There is also anticipation that a major exchange might list Pi Network token on this day. Nevertheless, despite the buzz surrounding this day, Pi Coin holders should remain concerned about the following: KYC and Mainnet Deadline Migration The Pi Network migration deadline is on Pi Day 2025. This migration will transfer Pi token holders and users from the testnet to the official blockchain that launched last month. Users can only migrate their tokens if they complete Know Your Customer (KYC) verification. Pi Network has set the deadline for migration on March 14, 2025. It has also stated that there will be no extensions to this deadline. Those who fail to complete KYC and the migration will end up losing most of their Pi tokens. Pi Network Migration Deadline The possibility of losing Pi Coins if one misses the migration deadline should concern token holders. Moreover, given the gains that the Pi Network token could see during this event, losing these coins could lead to major losses. Concerns About Decentralization Pi Network token holders should also be concerned about the level of decentralization on the project. Pi Coin has a maximum supply of 100 billion tokens. Meanwhile, data from PiScan shows that 62 billion tokens are held by six wallets belonging to the core team. Pi Coin Core Team Wallets Besides the supply distribution, the Pi Network has 2 active validators globally and only 17 active nodes. This is a significantly small number compared to decentralized networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have thousands of active nodes and validators that guarantee decentralization. Pi Network Nodes Such concerns could weigh on the Pi Network price after Pi Day. It may also hinder broader adoption, and impact investor confidence. Delayed Listing on Top Exchanges The Pi Network community is optimistic about Binance listing Pi Coin . Some anticipate that the listing could happen on Pi Day after the mainnet migration and users meet KYC requirements. Nevertheless, Binance has yet to confirm the listing. Coinbase has also not revealed plans to list this token despite Pi Coin gaining swift adoption in the US. If Pi Network token is not listed on another major exchange on Pi Day, it could slow the momentum and reduce investor confidence. Pi Network Price Shows Slow Momentum Pi Network price today is $1.68 with a marginal drop of 1.7% in 24 hours. The RSI is at 55, which is close to neutral levels, indicating that buying activity has slowed. The CMF indicator has also tipped south, which is a sign of Pi Coin price weakness as buying pressure fades. The lack of significant buying pressure around the Pi Network token despite the hype around Pi Day is concerning. If this momentum continues, the price could slip to the 23.6% Fibonacci level of $1.36. Conversely, if buying pressure surges and reverses the trend, Pi Coin could touch the 123.6% Fib level of $1.93. PI/USDT: 2-hour Chart Bottom Line The Pi Network token is poised for price volatility on Pi Day. While a flurry of announcements could spark gains, Pi Coin holders should still take note of factors like the mainnet migration. Concerns about decentralization and failure of being listed on other top exchanges may affect the price performance.

As Bitcoin and XRP struggle with price drops and setbacks, Remittix is gaining attention for its real-world utility and rising presale momentum. Table of Contents Bitcoin crash warnings keep coming Legal drama adds to Ripple’s woes Remittix redefines global payments Investors race to the Remittix presale Bitcoin and XRP are all on shaky ground, with prices tumbling and bad news piling up. BTC is flirting with a drop to $60k and XRP is caught in legal chaos. As the Nasdaq 100 loses a key support level, traders are looking for safer bets, and Remittix (RTX) is stealing the spotlight. With faster transactions, real utility, and massive upside potential, RTX is shaping up to be the next big thing, while the old giants struggle to stay afloat. So why are these old timers struggling, and how far could Remittix go in 2025? Bitcoin crash warnings keep coming Bitcoin (BTC) isn’t looking too hot right now. After struggling to hold $72k, the price has nosedived to even lower before climbing back up. The Nasdaq 100 just lost a key support level, and with BTC’s heavy correlation to tech stocks, that’s a bad sign. Institutional outflows have spiked, with over $800 million pulled from Bitcoin ETFs in the past week, signaling that big money is getting cautious. If macro conditions worsen, another major BTC sell-off could be on the cards, and that $60k fear could become a reality fast. Legal drama adds to Ripple’s woes XRP holders just can’t catch a break. After briefly climbing past $2.40, the price slid back under $2.10, making it one of the worst-performing major cryptos these past few days. And then there’s the SEC headache, Ripple’s ongoing legal battle just took another hit after a judge allowed the SEC’s appeal to move forward, putting XRP’s regulatory status back under scrutiny. Meanwhile, the recent XRP Ledger outage has spooked investors with concerns that network reliability issues could hurt adoption. If traders were hoping for some bullish momentum, this isn’t it; XRP needs a miracle to shake off this bad press.

Even though crypto has the potential to revolutionize finance, real-world adoption remains limited by a few key problems, such as slow exchange withdrawals, high fees, and banking restrictions. That’s exactly what Remittix is solving. The platform enables instant crypto-to-FIAT conversions, allowing users to send digital assets directly to bank accounts without the typical delays and excessive charges.

Similarly, Emily, an expat living in Canada, no longer has to deal with high remittance fees just to send money home to her family in the Philippines. With Remittix, she sends USDT, and her family receives Philippine Pesos the same day without paying excessive charges. By solving these everyday financial struggles, Remittix is making crypto as simple and accessible as traditional money. Investors race to the Remittix presale With its ability to streamline financial transactions, lower fees, and provide financial privacy, Remittix is stealing the PayFi show. The presale is booming, with more than $13.8 million raised to date from RTX sales. The native token is currently available for $0.0734, making now an opportune moment to get in early.

41634284,https://coinpaprika.com/news/court-approves-3ac-s-1-53b-claim-in-ftx-bankruptcy-battle,1741938818,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/41634284.jpeg,Court Approves 3AC’s $1.53B Claim in FTX Bankruptcy Battle,https://coinpaprika.com/news/court-approves-3ac-s-1-53b-claim-in-ftx-bankruptcy-battle,"Three Arrows Capital (3AC) has secured a major legal victory in its case against FTX. A U.S. bankruptcy court has approved the firm’s request to increase its claims in FTX’s bankruptcy proceedings from $120 million to $1.53 billion . This adjustment follows new findings that suggest 3AC had significantly larger dealings with FTX than initially reported. The expanded claim includes allegations of breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and unjust enrichment. The decision was made by the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, which ruled in favor of 3AC’s liquidators, Russell Crumpler and Christopher Farmer. They had initially filed their proof of claim in June 2023, seeking recovery of funds linked to a $120 million loan from FTX. However, after extensive investigations, they uncovered that, shortly before 3AC’s liquidation, FTX had liquidated $1.53 billion in assets belonging to 3AC to cover $1.3 billion in liabilities . Court records indicate that 3AC’s liquidators faced significant challenges in their investigation. Their work was complicated by a lack of proper records from 3AC, minimal cooperation from its founders, Kyle Davies and Su Zhu, and substantial delays in obtaining key documents from FTX. Many crucial pieces of evidence only surfaced in late 2023 and early 2024, long after FTX had filed for bankruptcy in November 2022. FTX strongly opposed 3AC’s request to expand its claim, arguing that the amendment was submitted too late and altered the scope of the bankruptcy process. FTX’s legal team contended that the original claim did not provide adequate notice regarding the new allegations or the total sum being pursued. However, the court rejected these objections, finding that much of the delay was due to FTX’s failure to provide necessary documents to the liquidators. Judge John T. Dorsey ruled in favor of 3AC’s claim expansion, stating that the equities of the case supported allowing the amended proof of claim . In his written decision, Judge Dorsey acknowledged that the liquidators had limited information when they first filed the claim and that new evidence justified the increase. He also noted that 3AC was unable to fully assess its financial dealings with FTX until after the original claims deadline had passed, as FTX had withheld critical data. This ruling marks a major step forward for 3AC as it continues efforts to recover funds lost during the FTX collapse. The now-defunct hedge fund had been one of the largest crypto firms impacted when FTX crumbled amid allegations of fraud and mismanagement under former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. While FTX’s objections have been dismissed in court, it remains unclear how this ruling will affect the ongoing bankruptcy process and potential creditor repayments. Given the scale of the updated claim, FTX’s remaining assets may now face additional strain as multiple entities seek to recover funds. Meanwhile, Sam Bankman-Fried is actively seeking legal avenues to secure a potential presidential pardon . The former FTX CEO has been making efforts to align himself with right-wing figures in an attempt to appeal to former President Donald Trump. Reports suggest that Bankman-Fried has appeared on conservative media outlets, including an interview with Tucker Carlson , and has consulted with a lawyer known for having connections to Trump. While Trump has issued controversial pardons in the past, skepticism remains over whether he would extend one to Bankman-Fried, given his lack of widespread support within the crypto community. With 3AC’s expanded claim now officially recognized, the next phase of legal proceedings will determine whether FTX creditors will see any additional recoveries. The case continues to unfold, and industry observers are closely watching how these financial and legal battles will shape the future of crypto bankruptcies.",,EN,0,0,REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-14 07:53:38

Russian oil companies have been using crypto assets like Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Tether’s USDt ( USDT ) to accelerate international trades, Reuters reported on March 14, citing four sources with direct knowledge of the matter. One Russian oil trader reportedly conducts tens of millions of dollars worth of monthly transactions using digital assets, according to a source who spoke on condition of anonymity due to a non-disclosure agreement. While the Russian Finance Minister publicly declared that Russia is free to use assets like Bitcoin in foreign trade in late 2025, the use of crypto in oil transactions with China and India has not been previously reported. Russia’s oil trade in crypto: How does it work? According to Reuters, the process of Russia’s foreign oil trade in crypto involves middlemen who manage offshore accounts and facilitate transactions in the local currency of the buyer. One example includes a Chinese buyer of Russian oil that pays a trading company acting as a middleman in yuan into an offshore account. The middleman then converts payments into crypto assets and transfers it to another account, which then sends it to a third account in Russia and converts it to Russian rubles, sources said. Crypto will be used no matter of sanctions According to one of Reuters sources, crypto will likely continue to be used in Russia’s foreign oil trading regardless of whether any sanctions are in place and even if the sanctions are lifted, and Russia is free to use the dollar again. “It is a convenient tool and helps run operations faster,” the report said, citing the source. The news comes amid the Bank of Russia officially proposing to legalize cryptocurrency investments for high-net-worth individuals, who have at least least $1.1 million in securities and deposits. This is a developing story, and further information will be added as it becomes available.

This could lead to short-term price volatility , affecting market sentiment and trader strategies. The expiration will settle a massive number of contracts, influencing price movements as traders adjust positions. Bitcoin options represent the largest share of the expiring contracts, making up the majority of the total amount. Despite the market’s current struggles, the put-to-call ratio suggests a generally bullish outlook , indicating that many traders still expect a price rebound. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s options expirations hold a smaller portion but could still contribute to market fluctuations. As these contracts approach their expiration, Bitcoin and Ethereum prices are expected to align with their respective max pain points , a level where the highest number of contracts expire worthless. This principle, widely recognized in options trading, suggests that the market could drift toward these levels before any major shifts occur. Trading platforms and analysts have been closely monitoring these expirations, with some suggesting that once these contracts settle, the pressure on Bitcoin and Ethereum may ease. However, due to the sheer scale of expiring options, increased market turbulence is still a possibility. Analysts examining market trends have noted that sentiment remains cautious in the short term . While economic reports earlier in the week showed promising signs, many traders remain uncertain about Bitcoin’s next move. Some speculate that support levels could be tested if selling pressure continues. In addition to market forces, external factors such as economic policies and global developments are also shaping sentiment. Some traders argue that inflation concerns and policy decisions, like tariffs introduced by the U.S. government, play a bigger role in driving prices than geopolitical events. Meanwhile, discussions around a potential peace deal in global conflicts have raised speculation that increased stability could benefit both traditional and crypto markets. Further insights from crypto analysts suggest that traders have been adjusting their strategies in response to recent price swings. Options market participants have shifted their positions, with many moving from aggressive short-term bullish bets to more conservative long-term call options. This reflects a market that remains highly reactive to external events and liquidity conditions. The expiration of these Bitcoin and Ethereum options is expected to create ripple effects across the market. While volatility is likely in the immediate aftermath, the long-term impact will depend on broader trends, economic indicators, and investor confidence.",,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|ETH|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-14 07:57:15

This move is reportedly being considered in light of XRP’s similarities to Ethereum, which was previously reclassified. Such a change could significantly impact Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the SEC, easing restrictions and improving market confidence. Recently, Vermont regulators dropped their case against Coinbase , citing the SEC’s new Crypto Task Force as a factor in their decision. The lawsuit originally argued that Coinbase’s staking services violated securities laws. However, with the SEC’s evolving approach to crypto regulation, Vermont no longer holds this position. This could set a precedent for Ripple’s case, as shifting regulatory attitudes may influence the Commission’s stance on XRP. The dispute between Ripple and the SEC has been one of the most high-profile legal battles in crypto . Under former SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, the Commission classified XRP as an unregistered security, preventing its sale in the U.S. Recent developments suggest that the SEC might be reconsidering its position, with discussions reportedly underway to negotiate new regulatory terms for XRP. Financial analyst Charles Gasparino noted that one of the key issues under review is whether XRP’s real-world utility makes it more of a commodity than a security. He pointed to Ethereum’s history, where ETH initially launched through an ICO but later transitioned into a decentralized asset. If XRP follows a similar trajectory, it could be reclassified under less restrictive regulations. This reclassification could mark a major shift in U.S. crypto policy. Commissioner Hester Peirce has previously suggested that some digital assets may no longer be considered securities. Additionally, the SEC is reportedly planning deeper collaboration with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the top U.S. regulator for commodities. If Ripple and the SEC reach an agreement, XRP could be subject to less stringent regulations , potentially leading to a more favorable market environment. A classification as a commodity would allow XRP to operate under clearer legal guidelines, similar to Ethereum, and could pave the way for institutional adoption. The legal case against Ripple has long been centered around whether XRP should be considered an investment contract or a decentralized asset with utility. Ripple has maintained that its network facilitates real-time global transactions, making it more aligned with commodity-like functionality. Vermont’s recent decision to drop its lawsuit against Coinbase also hints at a broader regulatory shift. In its official statement, Vermont’s financial authorities acknowledged that new federal guidelines are emerging. They cited the formation of the SEC’s Crypto Task Force as a sign that updated regulations will soon provide more clarity for digital assets. This move may set a precedent that benefits Ripple. If the SEC follows a similar path, it could determine that past regulatory actions against XRP were too strict. That would allow for a reassessment of its classification, opening the door to broader acceptance. If XRP is officially reclassified as a commodity, the effects could be immediate. Notably, this change could increase the likelihood of XRP ETF approvals , as commodities-based ETFs face fewer regulatory obstacles than securities-based funds. The decision could drive investor confidence and support XRP’s long-term market position. With regulatory attitudes shifting and new frameworks being developed, the next few months will be critical for XRP. If the SEC moves forward with this reclassification, it could signal a turning point for crypto regulation in the U.S. and solidify XRP’s standing as a major digital asset.",,EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP|MARKET|COMMODITY|ETH,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-14 07:59:58

However, when viewed from a broader perspective, Bitcoin remains in a bearish trend, down 9.3% in the past week and 24.7% from its all-time high (ATH) in January. This extended downtrend has raised concerns about whether the market is undergoing a deeper correction or if a potential reversal is on the horizon. Related Reading: Bitcoin Shows Signs of Recovery—Is the Whale Sell-Off Finally Over? Possibility Of A Deeper Correction in Bitcoin Analysts seem to have been closely monitoring Bitcoin’s market-value-to-realized-value (MVRV) ratio, which serves as a key indicator of whether Bitcoin is overvalued or undervalued based on historical price trends. CryptoQuant analyst Crypto Dan recently provided insights into Bitcoin’s current market position, noting that the proportion of BTC holdings under one month surged in both March and December 2024, reaching 23% and 24.5%, respectively. This trend mirrors past movements that preceded price corrections. With Bitcoin’s MVRV ratio now at 1.8, close to the 2024 correction low of 1.71, historical patterns suggest that a deeper decline to the $70,000 range could push the metric to similar levels seen in previous market bottoms. Market in an Oversold Zone After a Strong Correction “Even without an additional sharp decline, the market has already been sufficiently lightened, making it a favorable zone for a potential upward move without the need for further significant drops.” – By @DanCoinInvestor pic.twitter.com/mjLOQWlj4U — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) March 13, 2025 Key Indicators Suggest a Potential Rebound Despite the bearish sentiment, Crypto Dan emphasized that market conditions may already be near a turning point. He noted that altcoins have surrendered most of their recent gains, leaving many investors without profits in this cycle. This indicates that the market has already undergone significant deleveraging, reducing the likelihood of further sharp declines. If no major sell-offs occur, Bitcoin could enter a favorable zone for an upward move, even without a drastic drop to the $70,000 range. Dan also pointed out that the market is now in the final phase of its upward cycle, undergoing a strong correction that increases both risk and investment difficulty. However, as the market approaches an oversold state, the probability of a rebound also increases. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Mining Difficulty Rises Despite Market Drop—What Does It Mean? Dan highlighted that several key factors will determine whether this rebound materializes, including the strength and magnitude of the price recovery, whale activity, and changes in on-chain metrics during the rebound as well as Bitcoin’s correlation with the stock market and broader economic trends. While the short-term outlook remains uncertain, Dan noted: Despite the current stagnation, most cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, are in an oversold state, suggesting that a rebound is not far off. However, it is still too early to definitively conclude that the market has entered a full-fledged bear cycle.

President Nayib Bukele, however, has shown no intention of stopping the country’s Bitcoin acquisitions, despite the restrictions imposed by the deal. Since making Bitcoin legal tender, El Salvador has significantly expanded its holdings, positioning itself as a major player in the crypto space. While Bukele has touted this strategy as a way to boost financial independence, critics, including the IMF, have long expressed concerns about its potential economic risks. ARENA’s recent statement highlights fears that defying the IMF could destabilize the country’s financial standing. The agreement reached with the IMF stipulated that El Salvador would no longer use public funds to buy Bitcoin, even though it wouldn’t be required to sell its existing holdings. Yet, since securing the IMF loan, the government has continued making daily Bitcoin purchases, seemingly ignoring the terms of the deal. The IMF’s opposition to Bitcoin in El Salvador has been well-documented. Initially, the organization strongly criticized the country’s decision to adopt BTC as legal tender. However, last year, it softened its stance and offered financial assistance under the condition that the government would scale back its Bitcoin policies. The key requirement was that El Salvador would stop investing state funds into Bitcoin while maintaining its existing holdings. Bukele publicly stated that he would not halt Bitcoin purchases, and since the deal was finalized, his administration has continued to accumulate BTC . Crypto analysts have struggled to find any loophole that would allow the government to keep buying under the agreement, leaving many wondering whether Bukele is openly defying the IMF. ARENA’s leaders argue that this defiance could have serious economic consequences, urging the government to comply with the IMF’s terms. According to the party’s statement, adhering to the agreement is crucial for maintaining El Salvador’s financial stability and ensuring the country continues to receive international financial support. However, despite ARENA’s criticism, it lacks the political power to influence Bukele’s decisions. The party suffered a significant defeat in the last elections, securing just a small fraction of the seats in the Legislative Assembly. Meanwhile, Bukele’s party holds a dominant majority, making it virtually impossible for the opposition to push back against his policies. This situation creates uncertainty about how the IMF will respond if El Salvador continues its Bitcoin purchases. If the country is found to be violating the agreement, the IMF could take measures to withhold future financial assistance, potentially leading to broader economic instability. For now, El Salvador remains in uncharted territory. The government’s unwavering commitment to Bitcoin, combined with its ongoing defiance of IMF guidelines, has created an unpredictable financial landscape. Whether the IMF chooses to impose consequences or negotiate new terms remains to be seen.",,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-14 08:02:41

A recent survey conducted by tech firm Flant and Diasoft found that around 30% of Russian banks aren’t yet ready to adopt the digital ruble, Russia ‘s form of a central bank digital currency. According to a Vedomosti report , March 14, Russian banks appear to be reluctant to act as “agents” for the central bank. The main problem: concerns about losing control over their clients’ finances and facing stricter transparency requirements. Local experts suggest that banks realize the digital ruble would mean giving up some control and facing more reporting to the Bank of Russia, adding that the shift is “clearly not in the banks’ best interest.” The survey — which included over 150 IT directors and banking professionals — found that only 20% of banks reported that their infrastructure is ready for the digital ruble. About 50% said they’re only partially prepared.

While many banks face difficulties in adopting the digital ruble, some, including the sanctioned banking group VTB, Sberbank, and Gazprombank, are already preparing for the transition. In late February, crypto.news reported that the Bank of Russia delayed the mass rollout of the digital ruble. Russian authorities say that a new launch date will be announced later, highlighting the importance of ensuring the system benefits both banks and their clients. The digital ruble pilot began in August 2023, allowing select banks and users to test payments. The government had aimed for a wider launch by July 1, but the timeline now remains unclear.

According to Bloomberg, insiders claim that discussions were held regarding a partnership, including the possibility of launching a USD-backed stablecoin. However, the report does not suggest that Trump himself was directly involved. Earlier, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Trump family considered acquiring a stake in Binance.US, while also alleging that CZ sought a presidential pardon. CZ swiftly denied these claims, saying he had no discussions with anyone about a Binance deal and dismissing the article as politically motivated. However, his statements mainly focused on his personal actions, leaving room for speculation about wider Binance-Trump connections. Bloomberg has since doubled down on the claims, citing four unnamed sources who allege that WLFI explored collaboration with Binance . WLFI, a Trump-affiliated DeFi project , reportedly considered both developing a stablecoin and investing in Binance.US. While WLFI’s website states that Eric Trump is a board manager and that certain Trump family members hold WLFI tokens, the President himself is not officially linked to the project’s operations. If true, these discussions could raise ethical concerns. A partnership between WLFI and Binance could present serious conflict-of-interest issues , as Trump’s influence over financial regulators could directly impact Binance’s legal standing. The crypto community has already questioned Trump’s involvement in the TRUMP meme coin , and any direct financial ties to Binance would likely attract even more scrutiny. Despite the controversy, there is no concrete evidence that Binance finalized any agreement with WLFI . CZ has continued to push back against the allegations, calling Bloomberg’s reporting a “baseless hit piece” and claiming that Binance has no business ties with WLFI. He further stated that Binance never purchased any WLFI tokens, which Bloomberg itself never claimed. Adding another layer to the controversy, WLFI co-founder Steve Witkoff—a known Trump ally—was reportedly in attendance at the same Bitcoin MENA 2024 event where CZ spoke. While Bloomberg’s sources suggest that a meeting between the two took place, CZ has neither confirmed nor directly denied this possibility. The political and financial implications of these reports remain uncertain. Even if WLFI representatives did meet with Binance executives, it does not necessarily imply any direct Trump involvement. However, the overlap between Trump-affiliated entities and Binance remains a sensitive issue, especially given the regulatory scrutiny surrounding the crypto exchange. As this situation unfolds, questions about Binance’s regulatory future and Trump’s relationship with the crypto industry will continue to generate intense debate . While CZ remains firm in his denials, the existence of discussions between WLFI and Binance—if true—could reshape the narrative around Trump’s crypto stance and Binance’s ongoing efforts to regain credibility.",,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|BNB|REGULATION|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-14 08:05:25

So why are liberals against DOGE now? About two weeks ago, on The Joe Rogan Experience , Musk talked about the “entitlement fraud” and wasteful government spending, and more directly on the benefits extended to undocumented US immigrants. “ The main reason is that entitlement fraud, including Social Security, disability, Medicaid, for illegal aliens, is what is serving as a gigantic magnetic force to pull people in from all around the world and keep them here ,” Musk said. “ And they stop coming, and the ones that are here, many of them will simply leave .” The billionaire/White House advisor specifically pointed to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), accusing the agency of using funds meant for aiding Americans affected by natural disasters to pay for illegal immigrants to stay in luxury hotels in New York. “When we stopped that payment, we stopped all that money because that’s obviously an insane way to spend taxpayer money,” he claimed. “ New York sued the federal government to get the money. They were sending that money even after President Trump signed an executive order saying it needs to stop. They still pressed send on $80 million to luxury hotels in New York .” Obama, Biden, and Democrats also once pushed for spending cuts The fight from liberals against Trump and Musk’s cost-cutting efforts looks quite hypocritical now, given how past Democratic administrations advocated for those very same measures. During his presidency, Barack Obama repeatedly called for the government to eliminate wasteful spending. A video of Obama in 2011, now circulating on social platforms, shows that he also acknowledged how cutting the deficit would require difficult decisions, including reductions in programs valued by many Americans. Took 14 years and @elonmusk & @realDonaldTrump for the talk to become action. https://t.co/hBbc5kvjXo — Joe Rogan Podcast (@joeroganhq) March 14, 2025 He said eliminating “pointless waste and stupid spending” should be a common-sense, bipartisan priority, which sounds really familiar to what President Trump is saying now. “ No amount of waste is acceptable. Not when it’s your money. Not at a time when so many Americans are already cutting back. Just as families are living within their means, the government should too ,” Obama explained. Whom did the 44th US President appoint? Then-Vice President Joe Biden who agreed to track down misspent tax dollars across federal agencies. “ We need to go after every dime. We need to make the government work for you ,” Obama declared. According to records from the Manhattan Institute, the Obama administration, which served between 2009 and 2019, cumulative budget deficits reached $8.93 trillion, $4.6 trillion higher than initially projected. The former President had a plan, but he didn’t do much to execute it effectively. Some legislative measures, including the Affordable Care Act, were introduced to offset spending through tax increases and Medicare cuts. But once Republicans gained control of the House and Senate in his second term, they enacted $889 billion in net spending cuts. Schumer and Pelosi should be supporting DOGE In 2010, then-Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer acknowledged that Medicare inefficiencies needed to be addressed. “ If we’re going to eliminate the waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicare, it does mean we’re going to cut some of that out ,” Schumer said. “ One-third of Medicare doesn’t go to patient care. ” Great idea! https://t.co/YUMooI8umG — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 13, 2025 At the very same time period, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who is now a House Representative for California, insisted the US government should watch how they spend taxpayer dollars and avoid waste. “ Nobody, any of us who have been supportive of initiatives that help people like Medicare and Medicaid, are the most critical that every dollar is spent in the most effective way and that no taxpayer dollar is wasted ,” Pelosi reckoned.

But White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt isn’t having any of it; she believes the purported “fight” that liberals are putting up is just a facade. “ If you just watched that video, but shut your eyes and listened to the words from those Democrat politicians, you would think you are listening to President Trump, Elon Musk, and our entire administration ,” Leavitt said on Fox Business’s Hannity in mid-February. “ President Trump is just the first president in our lifetimes to actually do it. And now you see the Democrat Party and the mainstream media spiraling out of control about a very simple promise: rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse from our federal bureaucracy .” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

In a March 13 ruling by the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, the judge ruled that FTX is to pay out $1.53 billion to Three Arrows Capital, increasing the claim from the original $120 million filed in June 2023. FTX objected to the decision, arguing it was too late and would slow down their bankruptcy process. However, the judge sided with 3AC’s liquidators, opining that they had provided sufficient notice of their claim. The judge determined that the delay in filing the larger claim was mainly due to FTX not promptly sharing relevant records with 3AC’s liquidators. 3AC liquidators needed that information to properly assess and detail their claim. Source: March 13 ruling by the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware The 3AC’s liquidators are claiming that FTX held $1.53 billion in 3AC’s assets, which were then liquidated to pay off 3AC’s debts. Furthermore, 3AC liquidators argued that those transactions were avoidable and that FTX didn’t provide the information that would’ve uncovered the liquidation.

XRP price chart hints at possible 46% gains XRP has been consolidating inside a descending triangle pattern since topping out at its seven-year high of $3.40 on Jan. 16. After finding support from the triangle’s horizontal line at $2.00, the XRP/USD pair has left behind a sequence of higher lows over the last four days to its upper trendline, as shown in the chart below. XRP/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/ TradingView XRP‘s price is now testing the triangle‘s upper trendline at $2.30, raising hopes of a daily candlestick close above this level. If this happens, XRP could rally toward the $3.00 psychological level, a critical supplier congestion zone that has rejected the price twice in recent times. A move past this level would push the price toward the next major resistance at $3.27 and later to the multi-year high at $3.40, amounting to a rise between 30% and 46%.

Ripple’s prolonged legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) since 2020 over allegations of unregistered XRP sales may be nearing a resolution. The July 2023 ruling by Judge Torres, deeming XRP not a security for retail sales but fining Ripple $125 million for institutional violations, marked a turning point. Recent reports suggest both parties might drop their appeals, with Ripple negotiating better terms amid a perceived shift in SEC priorities under new leadership. “The SECGov vs. Ripple case is in the process of wrapping up and could be over soon,” said Fox Business’s Eleanor Terret, citing two unmentioned sources. Terret explained the SEC could be reconsidering its aggressive crypto enforcement, potentially aligning with a more lenient regulatory stance. “The argument, I’m told, is that the new SEC leadership is wiping the enforcement slate clean for all previously targeted crypto firms because it believes regulatory clarity will resolve the underlying issue.” As Cointelegraph reported, several cases against several crypto companies were dismissed in recent weeks, including Coinbase , Robinhood and Kraken , by the new SEC administration under acting Chair Mark Uyeda.

Governor Jim Pillen signed the LB609 bill into law, officially known as the ‘Controllable Electronic Record Fraud Prevention Act.’ This legislation requires crypto kiosk operators to obtain a license under the ‘Nebraska Money Transmitters Act’ and provide clear disclosures regarding service terms and fraud risks . Strengthening Regulations for Crypto Kiosks The new law comes in response to a growing number of scams linked to Bitcoin ATMs, with authorities noting a sharp rise in fraudulent activity in recent years. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reported in September 2024 that consumer losses from digital currency ATM scams exceeded $65 million in the first half of the year. The law is expected to tighten oversight on ATM transactions, ensuring that consumers are better informed and protected from potential fraud schemes . Meanwhile, Nebraska lawmakers and regulators seem to be positioning the state as crypto-friendly while enforcing measures to prevent misuse. Governor Pillen emphasized that Nebraska is committed to building a “secure and transparent” environment for cryptocurrency businesses. Pillen stated, Cryptocurrency is an emerging industry, and we’ve been working hard to build Nebraska into a crypto leader. We want everyone to know that we’re open for business — and that we’re doing it the right way. Senator Eliot Bostar, who introduced the bill in January also highlighted that digital currency ATMs must now comply with stricter licensing and disclosure requirements. The Nebraska Department of Banking will oversee the enforcement of these rules. Department Director Kelly Lammers reiterated that while Nebraska welcomes digital currency businesses, the state will also be closely monitoring transactions to prevent misuse. Lammers noted that a dedicated team will be established to track suspicious activity, focusing on protecting consumers from fraudulent schemes. Impact of the New Legislation on Crypto Adoption The implementation of LB609 signals Nebraska’s intent to balance innovation with consumer safety. While regulators have imposed strict rules on crypto ATMs , they are also working to create a “structured” framework that allows legitimate businesses to thrive. The legislation may encourage more digital currency firms to establish operations in Nebraska, given the state’s proactive approach to regulation. Crypto ATM operators will need to adjust to the new compliance requirements, ensuring that users receive adequate warnings about potential scams before completing transactions. The effectiveness of this law will likely depend on how well enforcement teams can identify and respond to fraudulent activities. With regulatory agencies increasing their scrutiny on digital asset transactions , Nebraska’s approach may serve as a model for other states looking to regulate crypto ATMs. Featured image created with DALL-E, Chart from TradingView",Crypto News|BTCUSDT|crypto|crypto atm|Crypto Fraud|Crypto Market|Nebraska,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|RUNE|FDUSD,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-03-14 09:00:07

Franklin Templeton, a $1.5 trillion asset manager, recently filed its own S-1 form for an XRP ETF. With increasing interest in digital assets, companies like BlackRock are eager not to miss the opportunity, as they did with Bitcoin ETFs. The competition is intensifying with many firms, including Grayscale, eager to offer XRP futures ETFs. Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, has forecasted that BlackRock will file for both Solana and XRP ETFs. He predicts that a Solana ETF could be filed at any moment, while an XRP ETF would likely come after the conclusion of the SEC lawsuit. For the unversed, in July 2023, a court ruled that Ripple’s direct sales of XRP to institutional investors broke securities laws, but sales on public exchanges did not. This resulted in a $125 million fine and restrictions on Ripple’s institutional XRP sales. The SEC has dropped cases against major crypto firms, and XRP could be next. Also, President Donald Trump’s administration created a Crypto Strategic Reserve, which includes Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). BlackRock currently leads the market in both Bitcoin and Ether ETFs by assets, and Geraci believes the company won’t let competitors launch ETFs on two of the top five non-stablecoin crypto assets without putting up a fight. Additionally, he predicts that BlackRock will also file for crypto index ETFs in the future. https://twitter.com/NateGeraci/status/1900346734410154143 Industry watchers are excited about the race, as BlackRock’s involvement would significantly impact the future of XRP ETFs, mirroring the success of Bitcoin ETFs. The SEC’s delay in approval may provide time for additional players like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton to solidify their positions. The race for XRP-related financial products is on, and all eyes are on the SEC’s next steps. Investors are closely monitoring these developments, hopeful that clearer regulations will guide the market forward and attract more institutional investors into the cryptocurrency space.

Bitcoin (BTC) continues to struggle, briefly dipping below $80,000 before recovering and moving to its current level. The flagship cryptocurrency is down nearly 2% over the past 24 hours and trades just below the $82,000 mark. Meanwhile, Ethereum did relatively better, although it still has not reclaimed $2,000. ETH is up just under 1% and trading just under the $1,900 mark. Ripple (XRP) has done substantially better, with its price up over 2% and trading at $2.29. Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) is up just under 1% and trading at $124. However, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Cardano (ADA) are down 0.50% and $2.16%, while Chainlink (LINK) and Stellar (XLM) have registered notable increases. Toncoin (TON) and Polkadot (DOT) registered substantial increases, while Hedera (HBAR) and Litecoin (LTC) registered notable declines. The crypto market cap is down almost 1% and currently sits at $2.67 trillion. Central Bank Of Russia Opens Up To Crypto The Central Bank of Russia has introduced a proposal to allow qualified investors to buy and sell crypto under an experimental framework for three years. The experimental framework will limit the activities to “particularly qualified investors,” a new classification for Russian citizens with over 100 million rubles in deposit and securities investments or with an income of at least half of that registered during the previous year. Companies qualified as investors would automatically be upgraded to the new tier. Additionally, any financial institution entering the sandbox would have to follow the directives issued by the Central Bank, depending on the risk of their specific investment. The Russian Central Bank will also open investments in crypto derivatives like securities and digital financial assets that do not require the settlement or delivery of crypto to their investors outside the proposed framework. Several market players are delighted with the new rules, and the San Petersburg Exchange (SPB) plans to offer these options. However, the Bank of Russia’s stance on crypto remains unchanged, and it still does not recognize the asset class as a mode of payment. Telegram Wallet Adds Crypto Trading And Yield Features Telegram has made another push into crypto with the platform’s self-custodial wallet, rolling out multi-asset trading and yield features and bringing crypto capabilities to over 100 million users. The wallet which initially focused on Toncoin, has added support for Bitcoin, USDT on TON, and several newer assets. The latest update allows users to buy, sell, or hold crypto directly in Telegram without complex on-chain deposits. A standout addition is the wallet’s earn feature that allows users to earn a yield for holding Toncoin. Support for USDT yields and loyalty programs for TON holders are also expected to launch later this year. The Open Platform (TOP) CEO Andrew Rogozov, stated, “With the current update, the wallet now operates as a fully-fledged crypto platform within Telegram while remaining as simple and accessible as ever. We also plan to implement a loyalty program specifically for toncoin holders to further boost the adoption of the TON Ecosystem.” Trump Family Seeking Stake In Binance Representatives of the Trump family have held discussions to acquire a stake in the US arm of Binance, the world’s largest crypto platform. The development comes as the company’s founder, Changpeng Zhao, seeks a presidential pardon. Zhao has served four months in prison after pleading guilty to violating anti-money laundering requirements. He remains Binance’s largest shareholder despite stepping down as CEO after the firm’s $4.3 billion settlement with US authorities in 2023. The discussion began after Binance approached Trump allies and offered a business deal with the family as part of a strategy to re-enter the US market. The potential investment into Binance could be made directly by the Trump family or through World Liberty Financial, a crypto venture backed by the Trump family. A presidential pardon would clear regulatory hurdles for Binance’s return to the market and help ease international business operations, while a stake in Binance would allow the Trump family to participate in the revival of a crypto trading platform. However, the discussion also raises unprecedented conflict of interest questions as Trump mixes his presidential powers and business interests. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) dipped into the red on Thursday after failing to build momentum and push towards $85,000. The flagship cryptocurrency is down over 25% from its all-time high as macroeconomic concerns, tariffs, a potential trade war with China, and policy uncertainty weigh on investor sentiment. The flagship cryptocurrency registered a marginal bump after the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) numbers came lower than expected., rising 2.8%, below the forecasted 2.9%. Meanwhile, core CPI numbers, which exclude food and energy, fell to 3.1%, lower than the expected 3.2%. However, the brief rally quickly fizzled out, with markets concerned about broader macroeconomic conditions. The bearish sentiment even dragged BTC to a four-month low on March 11. According to analysts, the crypto market is facing several challenges. Institutional investors have adopted a risk-averse strategy, moving capital away from risk assets. Meanwhile, recession fears are growing, and Trump’s tariff policies have shrouded the market with uncertainty. In the latest set of actions, President Trump has slapped a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, prompting retaliatory action from Canada. The EU also imposed $28 billion in retaliatory tariffs on US products, intensifying tensions and putting the markets on edge. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have also come under significant pressure as outflows increase. While there have been net positive inflows, they have been small compared to the volume of outflows. ETFs saw their largest single-day outflow on February 25, with investors pulling out over $1 billion, indicating a clear risk-off sentiment among institutional investors. Despite the significant outflows, BlackRock’s IBIT maintains its position as the dominant ETF with 568,000 BTC, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC and Grayscale’s GBTC at 197,500 BTC and 196,000 BTC. According to a technical analysis by CryptoCon, BTC’s sharp pullback from its all-time high could mean it has reached a local bottom or is at the beginning of a deeper correction. The analyst pointed out that BTC had reached historically low RSI Bollinger Band levels, where it rarely stays for long. “Bitcoin has now made a full return to critically low RSI Bollinger Band % levels, and it doesn't like to stay there for long. This comes after the completion of phase 4, the ATH break like January 2013, December 2016, and November 2020. What we're seeing now is looking just like March 2017! Likely not a coincidence that it's the same month. Phase 5 (the cycle top) was still 9 months away then, now has all the same characteristics of every local low we've seen this cycle.” BTC dipped to a low of $81,500 last Tuesday before rebounding and settling at $87,316. The flagship cryptocurrency reclaimed $90,000 on Wednesday after an increase of nearly 4% and settled at $90,639. It encountered volatility on Thursday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Sellers ultimately gained the upper hand as BTC registered a marginal drop to slip below $90,000 and settle at $89,957. The price continued dropping on Friday, falling 3.53% to $86,781. Price action remained bearish over the weekend as BTC dropped to $86,267 on Saturday. Bearish sentiment intensified on Sunday as BTC fell below $80,000 and the 200-day SMA, dropping to a low of $79,987 before reclaiming $80,000 and settling at $80,736. Source: TradingView Buyers attempted a recovery on Monday as BTC surged to an intraday high of $84,075. However, it could not stay at this level and dropped nearly 3%, falling below $80,000 and settling at $78,620. Sellers pushed BTC to a four-month low on Tuesday as it dropped to $76,635. It recovered from this level, rising 5.50% to reclaim $80,000 and settle at $82,945. Buyers retained control on Wednesday as BTC rose almost 1% to $83,709. However, it was back in the red on Thursday, dropping over 3% to $81,136. The current session sees BTC up nearly 1% and trading at $81,900. Buyers will look to retain control and push BTC above the 200-day SMA and $85,000. On the other hand, sellers will look to push BTC below $80,000. A break below this level could see the price drop to $75,000. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) is struggling to build momentum and reclaim $2,000. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency dipped to a low of $1,825 earlier today as bearish sentiment intensified before recovering and moving to its current level. ETH trades between $1,800 and $2,000 as it waits for a catalyst to dictate price action. That being said it has shed over half its value in the past few months as it struggles against several factors. Spot Ethereum ETFs have continued to register outflows as demand and interest from institutional investors wanes. The ETFs have registered total outflows worth $500 million over the past week, bringing the cumulative net inflows to $2.64 billion. The daily number of active Ethereum users has also declined, dropping to 293,000 addresses from over 700,000 earlier this year. ETH’s daily chart shows a clear downtrend, with the price making lower highs and lower lows. ETH has also dipped below multiple support levels and moving averages, indicating a bearish pivot. It also lost the psychological $2,000 price level and is testing a significant support zone around $1,900. A break below this level could drag ETH towards $1,600. ETH was quite bearish towards the end of last week, dropping nearly 2% on Thursday and 3% on Friday to settle at $2,142. However, the price recovered on Saturday, rising almost 3% and settling at $2,204. Bearish sentiment returned on Sunday as ETH plunged over 8% to $2,020. Buyers attempted a recovery on Monday as the price reached an intraday high of $2,159. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and dropped nearly 8%, slipping below $2,000 and settling at $1,865.

The firm said it had completed its token sale with a total financing amount of $550 million. WLFI maintained that its tokens, which can’t be sold or transferred, will be used as the governance token for the project’s yet-to-be-launched decentralized crypto trading platform. The project highlighted that it will grant WLFI token holders voting rights in community proposals.

WLFI tokens have a total supply of 100 billion, 35% of which was to be distributed in token sales to eligible participants. The completion of WLFI’s token sale. Source: World Liberty Financial. The firm started with an initial allocation of 20 billion tokens designated for the first public sale. The project commenced its first sale on October 15, 2024, with the token priced at $0.015. WLFI had also restricted access to individuals who qualified through a whitelist. The Trump-backed decentralized project had set an initial target for the token sale at $300 million. WLFI later reduced the presale target to $30 million due to weak demand in the early stages. The crypto project noticed a shift in tides after Official Trump (TRUMP) and Melania Meme (MELANIA) memecoins were launched. The project also revealed its partnership with the President’s official memecoin, TRUMP, which surged to over $73 hours after launch on Jan 19. The memecoin later dropped 40%, falling back to $41 after Melania Trump launched her own memecoin. WLFI noted that the launch ignited interest in the project and led to a surge in demand for WLFI tokens. World Financial Liberty had completed its initial token sale by January 20, selling 20% of its total token supply. The project later announced an additional 5% of its token supply at a price of $0.05 per token after seeing the surge in demand. WLFI’s adviser, Justin Sun, became the firm’s largest investor after investing $30 million in November. Sun later increased his investment in World Liberty Financial by an additional $45 million, bringing his total investment to $75 million. Co-founder of World Liberty Financial Zak Folkman said that the sizable purchase of WLF tokens showed the project’s early success. He added that significant purchases in recent weeks made him confident in the firm’s future success as it builds “a platform that promotes freer and fairer finance.” The firm also stated that an LLC affiliated with Trump and his family was entitled to 60% of the project’s equity and 75% of the fee revenue generated by the WLFI token sale. The LLC was also entitled to 22.5 billion WLFI tokens worth around $1.1 billion at the public sale price. WLF courts crypto teams for token swaps A source granted anonymity to discuss private business dealings has revealed that World Liberty Financial had been courting blockchains to take part in “token swap” deals. The source said that representatives for WLF had been approaching blockchain teams with an offer: buy at least $10 million worth of WLFI tokens with a 10% fee, and WLF will buy the same amount of the blockchain’s native token. A message from the project’s representatives indicated that the WLFI tokens would be transferred at a $1.5 billion fully diluted valuation, which is crypto verbiage for the theoretical total value of a given crypto token. The source’s message stated that the Trump-backed project is expected to launch in Q3 of this year at a $1.5 billion FDV. It also emphasized that none of the tokens could be subjected to a vesting period, and the minimum buy in for a token swap partnership was set at $10 million. Another source granted anonymity to discuss private business dealings also said their blockchain project received the same offer with the caveat that while $10 million was the minimum buy-in, it would take $15 million to receive priority treatment from WLFI.

41637104,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=140152,1741943410,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Bitcoin ETF Outflows: U.S. Spot Market Sees Unexpected $133M Exit,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/shocking-bitcoin-etf-outflows/,"Just when the crypto world started breathing a sigh of relief with the recent inflows into U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, a sudden shift has occurred. On March 13th, these much-watched investment vehicles experienced a shocking reversal, recording a significant net outflow of $133.15 million. This abrupt change, reported by crypto analyst Trader T (@thepfund) on X, raises eyebrows and prompts crucial questions about the sustainability of institutional interest in Bitcoin and the overall ETF market . Why Did Spot Bitcoin ETFs See Net Outflows? After a brief period of net inflows, the U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs landscape turned red on March 13th. Let’s break down where these outflows originated. Fidelity’s FBTC took the biggest hit, leading the exodus with a substantial $75.48 million in net outflows. ARK Invest’s ARKB followed closely behind with $60.23 million. Other ETFs experiencing net outflows include WisdomTree’s BTCW ($14.51 million), Grayscale’s GBTC ($12.68 million), Bitwise’s BITB ($10.95 million), and Franklin Templeton’s EZBC ($6.99 million). Interestingly, BlackRock’s IBIT was the sole bright spot, attracting a net inflow of $47.69 million. The remaining ETFs reported no changes in their holdings. ETF Net Flow (March 13, 2024) Fidelity (FBTC) -$75.48 million ARK Invest (ARKB) -$60.23 million WisdomTree (BTCW) -$14.51 million Grayscale (GBTC) -$12.68 million Bitwise (BITB) -$10.95 million Franklin Templeton (EZBC) -$6.99 million BlackRock (IBIT) +$47.69 million This sudden shift to Bitcoin ETF outflows begs the question: what’s behind this change in investor sentiment? Several factors could be at play: Profit-Taking: After a significant run-up in Bitcoin’s price, some investors may be taking profits off the table, especially in ETFs that have seen substantial gains. Market Volatility: The crypto market is known for its volatility. Concerns about potential regulatory actions, macroeconomic shifts, or broader market corrections could trigger risk-averse investors to reduce their exposure to crypto investment through ETFs. GBTC Outflows Persist: While the rate has slowed, Grayscale’s GBTC continues to experience outflows as investors move to ETFs with lower fees. This ongoing trend contributes to the overall net outflow figure. Rotation into IBIT?: The fact that BlackRock’s IBIT saw inflows while most others experienced outflows might indicate a rotation within the ETF market . Investors might be consolidating their holdings into larger, more established ETFs like IBIT. Impact on Bitcoin and Crypto Market Sentiment Bitcoin ETF outflows , even for a single day, can have a ripple effect across the crypto market. While one day of outflows doesn’t necessarily indicate a long-term trend reversal, it can impact market sentiment and potentially Bitcoin’s price. Here’s how: Price Pressure: Outflows mean that ETF providers are selling Bitcoin to meet redemptions. This selling pressure, even if temporary, can contribute to downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price. Sentiment Shift: Net outflows can be perceived as a negative signal, potentially dampening investor enthusiasm and leading to a more cautious market sentiment . Volatility Amplification: In an already volatile market, ETF outflows can amplify price swings, especially if they trigger further selling or reduce buying interest. Understanding Spot Bitcoin ETFs and Their Role Spot Bitcoin ETFs are investment products that allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency. They hold actual Bitcoin and their value is directly tied to the spot price of Bitcoin. The introduction of these ETFs in the U.S. was seen as a landmark moment for the crypto industry, offering a regulated and accessible avenue for institutional and retail investors to participate in the Bitcoin market. They are designed to track the price of Bitcoin, providing investors with a convenient way to diversify their portfolios and potentially benefit from Bitcoin’s price movements. However, it’s crucial to remember that Spot Bitcoin ETFs are still relatively new, and the market is still learning how to interpret and react to their flows. Daily fluctuations in inflows and outflows are expected, and it’s important to look at longer-term trends rather than overreacting to single-day data points. Navigating the ETF Market Volatility: Actionable Insights For crypto investors navigating this evolving ETF market landscape, here are some actionable insights: Monitor Long-Term Trends: Don’t get swayed by daily fluctuations. Focus on the weekly and monthly net flow data to identify meaningful trends in Bitcoin ETF outflows or inflows. Diversify Your Portfolio: Crypto investment , including Bitcoin ETFs, should be part of a diversified portfolio, not the sole focus. Manage your risk by allocating appropriately across different asset classes. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with crypto news, market sentiment indicators, and regulatory developments that could impact Bitcoin and the ETF market. Understand ETF Dynamics: Learn about the specific ETFs you are invested in, their fee structures, and their performance relative to Bitcoin’s spot price. Conclusion: A Pause or a Trend Reversal in Bitcoin ETFs? The $133.15 million net outflow from U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs on March 13th serves as a reminder of the crypto market’s inherent volatility and the nascent stage of ETF adoption. While concerning, a single day of outflows doesn’t necessarily signal a major trend reversal. The market is still digesting these new investment vehicles, and fluctuations are to be expected. Investors should remain vigilant, monitor market dynamics closely, and maintain a long-term perspective in their crypto investment strategies. The interplay between Bitcoin ETF outflows and inflows will continue to be a crucial factor shaping the future of the crypto market.

On March 10, 2025, X’s services went down for many users, causing frustration and confusion across the platform. The outages were significant enough to make headlines and draw attention from the tech community and the media. Elon Musk, ever the outspoken owner, quickly attributed the disruptions to a “massive cyberattack.” While the initial response was that the attack might have originated from a coordinated group or even a nation-state, Musk’s comments pointed to Ukrainian IP addresses as the suspected source. However, he later clarified that the evidence was not definitive. Also, several cybersecurity experts emphasized that attributing the source of such attacks based solely on IP addresses is unreliable, as attackers often use compromised devices worldwide to mask their actual location. So, what was the cause of X’s disruption? It was a large-scale, distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. Such attacks involve overwhelming a server with so much traffic that it cannot serve legitimate requests, effectively bringing down the platform. This attack is a common method for cybercriminals to take down websites and was the primary factor behind X’s downtime. The technical side: How the DDoS attack impacted X DDoS attacks are no small feat. These attacks flood the target’s servers with excessive traffic, rendering them unable to function correctly. It’s a strategy designed to exhaust a system’s resources and make it impossible for genuine users to access the service. Experts pointed out that the attack on X was massive and well-coordinated, taking down parts of the platform for hours. Here’s a timeline of the events on March 10: Early morning (Eastern Time): Users began reporting issues accessing X, with over 21,000 reports in the US and 10,800 in the UK. 9:30 am ET: A second wave of outages occurred, with about 40,000 users reporting disruptions. This outage persisted into the afternoon. Throughout the day: Users continued to experience intermittent access issues, with reports peaking during critical periods such as the start of National Football League free agency. Evening: By 6:24 pm ET, the number of reported issues decreased significantly to 403 in the US and 200 in the UK, indicating that the platform was stabilizing. Security experts noted that some of X’s origin servers had not been adequately protected behind Cloudflare’s DDoS defense systems. This created a vulnerability that cyber attackers could exploit, contributing to the success of the attack. Did any individual or group claim responsibility? Yes, in the aftermath of the attack, a pro-Palestinian hacker group known as Dark Storm Team claimed responsibility . This group has been active since late 2023 and is known for targeting organizations and governments perceived to support Israel. Their tactics often involve DDoS attacks to disrupt services and draw attention to their political motives. While X took quick action to shore up these weaknesses, this incident served as a reminder that even the most prominent platforms are not immune to cyber threats if their security infrastructure isn’t up to the task. Did you know? Cloudflare is renowned for its robust DDoS protection, having previously defended against some of the largest recorded attacks, including a 5.6 terabit per second assault in October 2024. From fail whale to Musk’s era: Major X outages in history Over the years, the platform has faced several high-profile outages caused by cyberattacks, internal errors and technical limitations. In its early days, X (then Twitter) was notorious for frequent crashes, often displaying the now-iconic “fail whale” image to users. These outages were primarily due to the platform’s struggle to handle surges in traffic, particularly during major global events like elections, award shows and sports finals. “Fail Whale” was Twitter’s old error message, showing a cartoon whale being lifted by birds. It appeared when Twitter was overloaded or crashed. It became a symbol of Twitter’s frequent outages, especially in its early days. Notable incidents from Fail Whale to Musk’s X era include: 2016 Dyn DDoS attack: One of the most severe outages in X’s history occurred during the Dyn cyberattack in October 2016. This massive DDoS attack targeted a key internet infrastructure provider, taking down major websites, including X, Reddit and Spotify. The incident underscored the risks of centralized internet infrastructure. 2020 API failures: In October 2020, a widespread outage due to internal system changes led to API failures. While not a cyberattack, the event demonstrated how a misconfiguration could bring down the platform for hours. 2022 takeover disruptions: Following Elon Musk’s acquisition in late 2022, several outages occurred due to mass layoffs affecting critical engineering teams. Reduced staffing raised concerns about the platform’s ability to maintain reliability. 2023 rate limit issues: In July 2023, X imposed strict rate limits on users due to excessive data scraping. This decision led to widespread service disruptions, with many users unable to load tweets. Did you know? The US Treasury is being sued for allegedly giving Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) access to millions of Americans’ sensitive financial and personal data. The lawsuit, filed by the AFL-CIO, claims this access violates federal laws and raises significant privacy concerns. Lawmakers, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, have warned that Musk’s involvement could lead to unprecedented data misuse. The growing importance of social media security The X outage highlights the growing concern about social media security in today’s digital world. Platforms like X, Meta and Instagram have become crucial communication channels for individuals, businesses, governments and activists. Even X has become a hub for the crypto community, serving as a central platform for discussions, updates, and networking within the industry. However, these platforms are increasingly under threat from cyberattacks, misinformation campaigns and data breaches. Here are some key areas where social media security is essential: Protecting user data: With millions of users actively posting, messaging and storing sensitive data, social media platforms are prime targets for hackers. Personal information, including emails, phone numbers and even financial data, can be compromised if security measures are weak. Enhancing user authentication: Stronger authentication methods, such as multifactor authentication (MFA) , biometric logins and encrypted messaging, can reduce the risk of unauthorized access. Users should be encouraged to enable MFA to add an extra layer of security to their accounts. Fighting disinformation and fake accounts: Cyberattacks aren’t always about taking down a platform; sometimes, they aim to manipulate public perception. Fake accounts, bots and misinformation campaigns can create chaos, influence elections and spread propaganda. Social media companies must use advanced AI tools to proactively detect and remove such threats. Preventing DDoS and cyberattacks: As seen in the case of X, DDoS attacks can cripple a platform. While companies invest heavily in cybersecurity, hackers continue to evolve their tactics. This calls for constant vigilance and AI-driven security systems to detect and mitigate threats in real-time. Regular security audits and updates: Cybersecurity is an ongoing process. Social media companies must conduct regular security audits to identify and patch vulnerabilities before attackers can exploit them. Keeping systems updated ensures that the latest security measures are in place. Finally, as you continue to integrate social media into various aspects of your lives, prioritizing security will ensure that these platforms remain trusted and reliable channels for communication and engagement.",Elon Musk|X,EN,0,0,TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-03-14 09:15:00

If you’re looking for the best new meme coins to join this month , BTFD Coin isn’t the only one making waves. Other trending picks like BOME, Turbo, Ponke, and Baby Doge Coin are showing serious potential in the meme economy. Here’s why these five are catching the spotlight. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin Presale That Could Deliver 3,650% ROI Meme coins that offer more than just hype tend to stand the test of time, and BTFD Coin is shaping up to be a project with real utility. With a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game that launched on January 1, 2025, this token is bringing interactive engagement to the meme space. Players can earn crypto by gaming, which directly fuels demand for BTFD Coin, making it one of the best new meme coins to join this month as more users jump in. Another major selling point is its staking system, offering an industry-leading 90% APY. Investors looking for passive income can lock up their tokens and watch their holdings grow while waiting for the price to surge. With over 11,300 holders and 71 billion tokens already sold, momentum is building fast. But what really has investors excited is BTFD Coin’s presale figures and potential ROI. With a current price of just $0.00016, the token is set to list at $0.0006, but analysts predict a post-launch run to $0.006—a 3,650% gain . To put that into perspective, an investor who puts $14,000 into BTFD Coin at the current price could see it grow to $525,000 if the $0.006 target is reached. The opportunity to lock in massive profits before the presale ends is what’s driving major FOMO right now. How to Buy BTFD Coin? Getting in on the BTFD Coin presale is easy.

In a new interview with Pomp Investments founder Anthony Pompliano at the Bitcoin Investor Week in New York, Mallers says that Bitcoin is a store of value asset that can easily compete with other assets used to store value, such as art or real estate. “[Bitcoin’s] product-market fit is in what people are calling store of value. Humans own about $900 trillion worth of stuff right now. That’s currency, real estate, art, collectibles, precious metals like gold – $900 trillion worth of stuff. It’s estimated that about half of that is monetized, meaning they own the stuff, they own the house, they own the art, they own the precious metal, not to consume it, not to live in the house, not to look at the art … but because they’re trying to store wealth. They’re trying to preserve value… That means the market opportunity to store wealth, store value … is about $400 trillion to $500 trillion.” He predicts that Bitcoin will capture a much larger portion of the store of wealth market cap in the coming years. “So when people say, you know, can Bitcoin go higher than $100,000, the way I think about it is, right now Bitcoin’s about $1.5 trillion in market cap is going after a $400 trillion to $500 trillion opportunity… So I think Bitcoin still has a 400x to 500x left in it… I think Bitcoin is going to grow to hundreds of trillions dollars in market cap.” Bitcoin is trading for $80,964 at time of writing, down 3.3% in the last 24 hours.

You’re not wrong! The latest data from CoinMarketCap (CMC) confirms it: we’re officially in Bitcoin Season. The Altcoin Season Index has taken a dip, landing at a mere 14 as of 00:27 UTC on March 14th. This is a slight decrease from the previous day’s 15, but the message is clear: Bitcoin is currently leading the charge in the cryptocurrency arena. Let’s dive deep into what this means for you and the broader crypto landscape. Decoding the Altcoin Season Index: What is it and Why Does it Matter? Think of the Altcoin Season Index as a crypto weather vane, but instead of predicting rain, it forecasts market trends. This fascinating metric, provided by CoinMarketCap, helps us understand whether Bitcoin or altcoins are in the spotlight. It’s a simple yet powerful tool for gauging the overall sentiment and direction of the cryptocurrency market, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens to give a clearer picture of true asset performance. Here’s the breakdown of how this index works: Scope: The index analyzes the top 100 cryptocurrencies listed on CMC. Timeframe: It looks at price performance over the past 90 days. Benchmark: The performance is compared against Bitcoin (BTC). Threshold for Altcoin Season: To officially declare an “Altcoin Season,” at least 75% of the top 100 coins must have outperformed Bitcoin in the last 90 days. Threshold for Bitcoin Season: Conversely, a “Bitcoin Season” is declared when 25% or fewer of these coins have outperformed Bitcoin. Index Range: The index score ranges from 1 to 100, providing a clear visual representation of the market’s lean. In essence, the lower the Altcoin Season Index, the stronger the Bitcoin dominance . A score of 14, like we’re seeing now, strongly suggests that Bitcoin is outperforming the vast majority of altcoins in the current market cycle. Bitcoin Season in Full Swing: What Does an Index of 14 Actually Mean? With the Altcoin Season Index at 14, we are firmly entrenched in Bitcoin Season . But what does this practically mean for the crypto market and your portfolio? It signals a period where Bitcoin is not just holding its own, but actively outperforming most other cryptocurrencies. This could be driven by several factors: Flight to Safety: During times of market uncertainty or volatility, investors often flock to Bitcoin as a perceived safer haven within the crypto space. Institutional Interest: Growing institutional adoption of Bitcoin can further solidify its dominance, as large investors often prioritize BTC as their entry point into crypto. Narrative Shift: Market narratives can shift, and currently, the focus might be back on Bitcoin’s core value proposition as digital gold and a store of value. Altcoin Underperformance: It’s not just Bitcoin doing well; it can also be that altcoins are facing headwinds, whether due to regulatory concerns, project-specific issues, or simply market cycles. Navigating the Crypto Market in Bitcoin Season: Strategies and Considerations So, the crypto market is currently experiencing Bitcoin dominance . What should you, as a crypto enthusiast or investor, consider during this phase? Here are some actionable insights: Portfolio Review: Take a close look at your portfolio. How heavily weighted are your altcoins compared to Bitcoin? Bitcoin Season might be a time to rebalance, potentially increasing your BTC holdings. Risk Assessment: Altcoins, by nature, are generally more volatile than Bitcoin. During Bitcoin Season, this volatility can be amplified. Understand your risk tolerance and adjust your positions accordingly. Fundamental Analysis: Don’t abandon altcoins entirely! Bitcoin Season can be a good time to research and identify fundamentally strong altcoin projects that might be undervalued and poised for growth when market sentiment shifts. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) into Bitcoin: If you believe in the long-term potential of Bitcoin, Bitcoin Season can present an opportunity to DCA at potentially favorable prices compared to altcoins. Stay Informed: Market conditions are dynamic. Keep a close eye on the Altcoin Season Index and other market indicators to adapt your strategy as the market evolves. To further illustrate the difference, let’s consider a simple comparison: Feature Bitcoin Season Altcoin Season Altcoin Season Index Value Low (e.g., 14) High (e.g., 75+) Market Dominance Bitcoin Dominant Altcoins Gaining Momentum Investor Focus Bitcoin, Perceived Safety Altcoins, Higher Growth Potential (and Risk) Typical Market Sentiment Cautious, Flight to Quality Optimistic, Risk-On The Ever-Shifting Sands of the Crypto Market The Altcoin Season Index is a valuable tool for understanding the ebb and flow of the crypto market . Currently, it’s clearly signaling a Bitcoin Season , a period where Bitcoin is leading the charge. However, the cryptocurrency market is known for its rapid changes. Altcoins often follow their own cycles, and market sentiment can shift quickly. Understanding these cycles and utilizing tools like the Altcoin Season Index can provide crucial insights for navigating this dynamic landscape. Remember, Bitcoin Season doesn’t mean the end for altcoins. It simply indicates a current market phase. By staying informed, adapting your strategies, and focusing on fundamental analysis, you can navigate both Bitcoin and Altcoin Seasons effectively in the exciting world of cryptocurrency.

Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum fell by 13% this week after the price failed to hold above $2,000. With this key psychological level lost, buyers have retreated to the support found at $1,800. This latest drop in price puts ETH at bear market levels not seen since 2023. In December 2024, this cryptocurrency entered into a downtrend that barely had any relief rallies since. This severe correction saw the price fall by almost 60% from its most recent high at $4,100. Looking ahead, Ethereum is in desperate search of a bottom that can stop this downtrend. It’s still uncertain if the support at $1,800 will be able to stop sellers so that it can start a recovery. Chart by TradingView Ripple ( XRP ) Surprisingly, XRP continues to hold above $2 even though its price fell by 8% this week. Somehow, buyers managed to stop any pressure from sellers at this key level, which has already been tested several times. At the time of this post, the asset is found around $2.3 and will need to move above $2.4 if it hopes to re-test the key resistance at $3. XRP has a good shot at that if buyers pick up momentum in the coming days. Looking ahead, XRP looks much better than most altcoins making lower lows, like Ethereum. This makes it an outlier that may be quick to move higher once market sentiment improves. That would be confirmed if the $3 resistance is broken later on. Chart by TradingView Cardano (ADA) ADA had a difficult week after it crashed by 18% and returned to the key support at $0.64. So far, the price seems to hold above this level, but the momentum remains bearish even if the it was briefly above $1 at the start of March. The resistance is found at $0.9 and this level has to turn into a key support if ADA is to return on an uptrend. Considering the overall altcoin market remains bearish, it is hard to see Cardano becoming an outlier. Looking ahead, this cryptocurrency is found in a downtrend. Until this reverses, ADA’s price is likely to make new lows with $0.5 as a key level if the current support fails. Chart by TradingView Solana (SOL) Solana had another bad week. Its price fell by 12% after losing support at $134. With this level turned into key resistance, buyers have retreated to $105, which is currently the most important support level. The chart of SOL looks very similar to Ethereum. It’s making lower lows which is characteristic of a clear downtrend. It is unlikely that a reversal will happen any time soon, but the support around $100 is a good candidate for a relief rally, at least. Looking ahead, Solana may make new lows. If so, watch closely how the price will react around $100. Either way, this cryptocurrency must not lose a three-digit price, as that would be a major psychological blow to any bullish sentiment. Chart by TradingView Hyperliquid (HYPE) Hyperliquid entered the crypto space on a very high note with an excellent release of its HYPE token, which saw its valuation skyrocket in the first few weeks after launch. However, this sentiment quickly changed at the end of 2024. Since February, HYPE’s price has been in a downtrend. It closed the week with an 18% loss after the support at $15 turned into resistance. Buyers have now retreated to $11, which could provide some relief in the future if sellers continue to maintain pressure. Looking ahead, HYPE is found in a difficult spot with no clear reversal in sight. If nothing changes, the price could fall under $10 in the future. Such a discount could incentivize buyers to return and reverse this downtrend.

Russia is using cryptocurrency in its oil trade with China and India to evade Western sanctions, sources familiar with the matter said, according to Reuters. Russia has openly encouraged the use of cryptocurrencies and last summer passed a law allowing cryptocurrency payments in international trade, but there has been no previous mention of cryptocurrency being used in Russia’s oil trade. Some Russian oil companies are using Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH) and Tether (USDT) to facilitate the conversion of Chinese yuan and Indian rupees into Russian rubles, sources told Reuters.

Even if these negotiations yield positive results, it remains unclear whether sanctions against Russia will be lifted. One of the sources said that even if sanctions are lifted and the dollar can be used again, cryptocurrencies will continue to be used in Russian oil trade.

SEC lawsuit. In a recent post, Rector highlighted that the mainstream crypto market continues to overlook developments in the case. After analyzing comments from his YouTube and X accounts and across social media, he has concluded that retail investors are playing around, waiting for official headlines before making significant moves instead of acting proactively. Many experts have predicted that many retail investors will be priced out once XRP starts growing, and with the lawsuit’s resolution around the corner, the asset might begin climbing sooner than many expect. I read all my YT comments and watch X all day. Retail is still playing around with their XRP bag like a settlement isn't imminent. Mainstream crypto is still ignoring. Self Loathers are still in disbelief that the end is near. Retail doesn't move till the headlines hit. XRP… — Zach Rector (@ZachRector7) March 12, 2025 Will the SEC Settle With Ripple? Recent reports suggest that a settlement may be imminent. Former Fox Business journalist and host of the Crypto In America podcast Eleanor Terrett reveals that the primary obstacles are the $125 million penalty on Ripple and a permanent injunction restricting institutional sales. Given the SEC’s recent trend of dismissing cases and investigations in the crypto sector, speculation is growing that the Ripple lawsuit may soon be resolved. Other experts in the crypto space have also speculated that Ripple is negotiating to remove the permanent injunction, which could help the asset climb even higher through increased institutional investment. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Community Sentiment on XRP’s Valuation In response to Rector’s post, many XRP holders expressed confidence that the end of the lawsuit could trigger a price surge. Common Sense Crypto (@TheCSCrypto), a popular analyst on X, referenced past estimates that XRP’s price could range between $7 and $13 upon the lawsuit resolution. Another commenter noted that institutional crypto custody is now a reality, making the end of the SEC’s case the final barrier to XRP’s growth. He revealed that he had recently bought more XRP, and has high expectations for the digital asset. Some long-term investors also reaffirmed their commitment. One commenter stated , “I am locked in. There is no other option for us XRP OGs.” Can the Mainstream Audience Capitalize on XRP? Many investors wait for a major development or price surge before buying, but experts warn that XRP moves fast , making it easy to miss out. These investors also tend to sell too early, eager to take profit, and miss out on future growth. Smart investors can see the true potential of the asset. One expert has consistently reaffirmed his target of $333 , stating that he wouldn’t sell his XRP until it hits that price, and many like him are eagerly waiting for the asset to show how high it can go.

At the Group of Seven (G7) meeting in Canada, European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said the real winner of the ongoing tariff war is China. “Who is laughing on the side or looking at the side is China,” Kallas said in an interview. Her statement came after US President Donald Trump threatened 200% tariffs on French and European wines, champagne, and other alcohol imports. The move was retaliation for the EU’s plan to impose taxes on American whiskey exports, which itself was a response to Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminum. Kallas said the EU is prepared to fight back but wants to avoid economic fallout. “We keep a cool head, and of course, we are ready to act and defend our interest when we need to,” she said . The impact was immediate. European alcohol stocks plummeted. LVMH, the parent company of Moët & Chandon and Veuve Clicquot, fell 2.2%, Rémy Cointreau SA lost 4.5%, and Pernod Ricard dropped 3.6%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 entered a correction, hitting its lowest level in six months as investors reacted to another inflation report and Trump’s latest tariff threats. Trump’s trade wars are pushing allies away Trump’s aggressive trade policies have put traditional US allies on edge. The European Union is now negotiating new trade deals with other partners, moving away from its reliance on the US. Former US diplomat Wendy Cutler said the EU has already taken major steps toward diversifying trade. “The EU had concluded a big deal with the Mercosur countries. The EU and India are going to restart their negotiations,” she said. Mercosur, a trade bloc of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay, signed a landmark trade deal with the EU in December. The agreement eliminates tariffs on over 90% of trade, giving European companies a €4 billion annual boost. It also means South American goods will have better access to European markets than US or Japanese products. China is taking full advantage of the US-EU tensions. David Roche, strategist at Quantum Strategy, said Europe has no choice but to explore alternatives. “The reality is, in the broadest sense of the word, Europe has to look for alternative markets to the US. China can help,” Roche said. China strengthens its global trade position China has been expanding trade partnerships while the US continues to isolate itself. It recently upgraded its free trade agreement with ASEAN, securing stronger economic ties in the region. Cutler pointed out that China is actively offering economic stability to US trade partners. “If our partners can’t rely on us, guess what? These other countries, including China, look more attractive,” she said. At the same time, the US is absent from key global trade agreements. The US is not part of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) or the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). Hong Kong has applied to join RCEP, and the UK recently joined CPTPP, further shifting global trade away from American influence. With Europe looking to diversify its trade, there’s even speculation that the EU might consider joining CPTPP. Cutler believes this is a real possibility. “I expect other countries to express interest … I don’t think it’s out of the question that perhaps the EU even thinks about joining CPTPP. It’s a new world out there,” she said. Trump’s chaos strategy leaves allies frustrated Trump’s approach to trade policy has been unpredictable. Stephen Olson, senior fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, said Trump deliberately keeps trade partners off balance. “Trump thinks that he thrives under situations of chaos. So when everyone else in the world is running around with their hair set on fire, Trump thinks that works to his advantage,” Olson said. For US allies, this makes long-term trade agreements impossible. Olson dismissed the idea that Trump’s trade war has a clear strategy. “My advice would be … don’t bother,” he said, adding that Trump is not interested in “solid, concrete resolutions”. Instead, his goal is to keep trade partners under pressure, never letting them feel secure in negotiations. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Data from onchain analytics platform CryptoQuant revealed the extent of recent capitulation by short-term holders (STHs). Bitcoin speculators run to the exit “in the red” Bitcoin ( BTC ) entities hodling coins between one and three months bore the brunt of a brutal bull market drawdown, and many did not stay the course. CryptoQuant suggested that this section of the overall STH investor cohort, defined as those buying up to six months ago, is around $100 million out of pocket. “This represents a significant reduction in the value of Bitcoin held by this cohort, who are now underwater as many bought at higher prices and are exiting with losses,” contributor Onchained wrote in one of its “Quicktake” blog posts on March 13. Onchained referenced the market cap and realized cap of the relevant entities, corresponding to the current value of the BTC they own versus the price at which they last moved onchain. “The market capitalization (MC) of their holdings is now lower than the realized capitalization (RC), signaling that these holders are locking in realized losses,” the post said. “This behavior is contributing to increased selling pressure and could lead to further downward price action in the short term.” Bitcoin 1-3 month investor market cap, realized cap (screenshot).

In its latest weekly report seen by Cointelegraph on March 12, CryptoQuant warned that the current correction may be more tenacious than it appears on the surface. “Historically, bull market corrections tend to be short-lived and followed by strong recoveries, but current on-chain indicators point to a potential structural shift that could preclude a broader bearish phase,” it summarized.

The token trades near $0.7250 after a 11% day-to-day recovery but suffers a 40% loss from its March peaks following its entry to the U.S. strategic reserve which shows no future expansion plans. A major loss of confidence has occurred because co-founder Charles Hoskinson has stayed away from important policy discussions which has exposed ADA to continuous selling pressure. Financial analysts predict a probable 50 percent market decline in ADA price to reach $0.27 when macroeconomic stress intensifies which would extend bearish conditions. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) leverages market sentiment shifts to attract Cardano holders who are drawn into quick-selling phases by its established profit plans and practical DeFi functionalities. Cardano’s Rocky Path Various investor disputes alongside external market threats become the main causes behind Cardano’s current difficulties. The token experiences short-lived relief before encountering resistance at its 200-day moving average which has already been tested on three occasions within one month. Political projects falling short and dormant reserve spending increased investor concern which made them search for options showing more appealing growth perspectives. ADS faces increased possibilities of price declines due to widespread market volatility that combines recessionary jitters with rising caution levels among traders. The chart indicators suggest ADA could break down from its $0.55 February support level which may trigger a price drop of 50% into future market zones during late-2024. Mutuum Finance shows an upward trend in its business operations while ADA holders choose to pivot to this platform due to their discontent with ADA’s present standing. Mutuum Finance’s Strategic Ascent Mutuum Finance (MUTM) currently sells through its third presale period at $0.02. It has attracted investment from 5,500 participants totaling $3.2 million. The upcoming Phase 4 of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will rapidly progress toward a price increase to $0.025 while investors actively predict this advancement. People who invest in Mutuum Finance during early phases can expect a 200% ROI as the token reaches its $0.06 exchange listing while the tokenomics follow open guidelines instead of market-driven speculation. Numerous analysts expect Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to rise from its current $0.02 to $3.50 by 2025 based on new projections that account for user adoption and stake buy-back initiatives. This constitutes a predicted 17,400% increase from the launch price. The operational features of decentralized lending pools and overcollateralized loans together with mtTokens enabling value growth through interest redistribution create the forecasting basis. The stability mechanism of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) arises from its systemic purchase mechanism. Networking fees on the platform automatically obtain MUTM tokens that distribute to stakers and liquidity providers continuously. The system creates a mechanism that prevents selling of tokens along with benefits structured for long-term owner maintenance. The mtTokens system allows users to earn yields directly from their holdings across multiple platforms which attracts investors who want to maximize their yield. Users who enter late into Phase 3 will likely face higher costs when exchanges begin trading because of concentrating supply during the Phase. Timing the Shift Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents a shielded opportunity for investors who wish to preserve their capital within operating DeFi systems when Cardano faces external dangers. Through its staged presale approach the project generates progressive capital enhancement which will continue to grow after its market release. Investors who need to restructure their portfolios because of ADA instability can find a quantifiable risk buffer through MUTM. Investors should buy positions in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) during Phase 3 because prices will rise and opportunities will decrease. The chances to maximize presale benefits decrease speedily so potential buyers should join now to secure profitable investments before its launch on the market.

41637926,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=140138,1741944638,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Resilient Bitcoin ETFs: 95% Capital Stays Put Amidst Inflow Fluctuations,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-etf-capital-retention/,"The world of crypto investments is never short of surprises, but sometimes, the most compelling stories are about stability amidst volatility. Recently, all eyes have been on Bitcoin ETFs, especially as inflow numbers have shown a dip. But here’s the fascinating twist: despite these fluctuations, Bitcoin ETFs are proving their mettle, holding onto a staggering 95% of their invested capital. Let’s dive into what this means for the future of crypto investment and why this is a significant indicator of investor confidence in Bitcoin ETFs. Decoding the Bitcoin ETF Inflow Trend According to Bloomberg Intelligence, the cumulative spot Bitcoin ETF inflows experienced a decrease, dropping from $40.25 billion on February 7th to $34.9 billion as of March 11th. This data, highlighted by Eric Balchunas, a Senior ETF Analyst at Bloomberg, initially sparked concerns about waning interest in these investment vehicles. But is this dip in ETF inflows a cause for alarm? Not necessarily. It’s crucial to look beyond just the inflow numbers and examine the bigger picture. Here’s a quick breakdown of the inflow situation: Peak Inflow (Feb 7): $40.25 billion Recent Inflow (Mar 11): $34.9 billion Decrease: $5.35 billion While a $5.35 billion decrease might sound substantial, it’s important to consider the context of the overall market and the total assets under management (AUM) of these ETFs. The Astonishing Resilience: 95% Capital Retention Here’s where the truly compelling narrative emerges. Despite the reduced ETF inflows , the total AUM for spot Bitcoin ETFs remains robust at $115 billion. This figure underscores a crucial point: over 95% of the capital invested in these Bitcoin ETFs has stayed put. This high retention rate speaks volumes about investor sentiment and the long-term conviction in Bitcoin ETF products. Think about it – in the often-turbulent crypto market, where assets can be quickly moved based on short-term price fluctuations, the steadfastness of capital within Bitcoin ETFs is remarkable. It suggests that investors are not simply chasing short-term gains but are adopting a more strategic, long-term approach to crypto investment through ETFs. Why is Capital Retention a Big Deal for Bitcoin ETFs? This high retention rate is not just a number; it’s a powerful indicator with several positive implications: Strong Investor Confidence: Maintaining 95% of invested capital suggests a high level of confidence among investors in Bitcoin ETFs as a viable investment avenue. They are choosing to hold their positions, even amidst fluctuating inflows, indicating belief in the long-term potential of Bitcoin. Long-Term Investment Strategy: The data points towards a shift from short-term speculation to long-term holding within the crypto ETF space. Investors are likely viewing Bitcoin ETFs as a strategic part of their portfolio, rather than a quick-profit scheme. Market Maturity: This stability can be seen as a sign of maturing crypto markets. The focus is shifting towards sustainable growth and long-term value accumulation, rather than being solely driven by hype and rapid trading. Reduced Volatility Impact: High capital retention can potentially buffer Bitcoin ETFs against extreme volatility. A stable AUM provides a cushion against market downturns and reinforces the ETF’s position as a reliable investment product. The Role of Institutional Investment in Bitcoin ETFs While retail investors play a significant role, the steady capital within Bitcoin ETFs also hints at the growing influence of institutional investment . Institutions typically have a longer investment horizon and conduct thorough due diligence before allocating capital. Their participation in Bitcoin ETFs would naturally contribute to higher retention rates and greater market stability. Here’s why institutional involvement is crucial: Factor Impact of Institutional Investment Investment Horizon Longer-term perspective, reducing knee-jerk reactions to market fluctuations. Due Diligence Thorough research and analysis, leading to more informed and stable investment decisions. Capital Size Larger capital deployments, contributing to significant and sustained AUM. Market Credibility Increased legitimacy and acceptance of Bitcoin as an asset class. As institutional investment in crypto continues to grow, we can expect this trend of strong capital retention in Bitcoin ETFs to persist and even strengthen. Bitcoin Price and ETF Performance: A Symbiotic Relationship? The performance of Bitcoin ETFs is intrinsically linked to the Bitcoin price . While ETF inflows and outflows can influence short-term price movements, the fundamental value driver remains Bitcoin itself. The fact that Bitcoin ETFs are retaining capital despite inflow dips could be interpreted as a bullish signal for the underlying asset. A strong AUM in Bitcoin ETFs can potentially: Support Bitcoin Price: Consistent demand through ETFs can provide buying pressure, supporting the Bitcoin price, especially during market corrections. Attract Further Investment: Stable and growing ETFs can attract more investors, both retail and institutional, further fueling the ecosystem. Enhance Market Liquidity: Active Bitcoin ETFs contribute to market liquidity, making it easier for investors to buy and sell Bitcoin. However, it’s important to remember that the Bitcoin price is also influenced by a multitude of other factors, including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments, and overall market sentiment. Navigating the Future of Crypto Investment with Bitcoin ETFs The resilience demonstrated by Bitcoin ETFs in retaining 95% of capital, even with fluctuating inflows, paints an encouraging picture for the future of crypto investment . It highlights a maturing market where long-term conviction and strategic allocation are gaining prominence over short-term speculation. For investors, this signifies a potential shift towards more stable and reliable crypto investment vehicles. Key Takeaways for Investors: Long-Term Perspective: Consider Bitcoin ETFs as a long-term investment, rather than a get-rich-quick scheme. Diversification: Bitcoin ETFs can be a valuable tool for portfolio diversification within the crypto space. Due Diligence: Understand the nuances of Bitcoin ETFs, including fees, tracking error, and the underlying Bitcoin market. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market trends, regulatory updates, and developments in the crypto ETF space. In conclusion, the story of Bitcoin ETFs retaining the vast majority of their capital amidst inflow variations is a testament to the enduring appeal of Bitcoin and the growing sophistication of the crypto investment landscape. It’s a powerful sign of investor confidence and a beacon for the continued evolution of crypto as a mainstream asset class.

Is The Bitcoin Bottom In? Hyland noted that BTC’s weekly resistance level currently hovers around the $90,500 level. The analyst emphasized that if BTC has a weekly close above $89,000, then it may indicate that the market bottom is in. He added: If we do get a weekly close above this area ($89,000 to $91,000), I think the low is in for Bitcoin, and we are not going down to this area. To recall, BTC last traded above $89,000 earlier this month on March 9. From there, the cryptocurrency experienced a breakdown to lower price levels, primarily due to rising macroeconomic uncertainties due to US President Donald Trump’s trade tariffs on numerous countries. Related Reading: Bitcoin Slips Under 200-Day Moving Average – Will The Downtrend Continue? According to data from cryptocurrency exchange Binance, after failing to defend the $89,000 level, BTC ended up falling as low as $76,606 on March 10. Since then, the digital asset has made slight recovery, buoyed by lower than anticipated US CPI inflation data and is currently trading in the low $80,000 level. BTC Faces Strong Resistance At $86,100 Similarly, in a recent Quicktake post on CryptoQuant, analyst Yonsei_dent highlighted the significance of short-term holder (STH) Realized Price in determining the digital asset’s future price trajectory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Uptrend Soon? Dollar Index Breakdown Sparks Optimism Among BTC Bulls For the uninitiated, Bitcoin’s Realized Price refers to the average acquisition cost of investors while STH refers to holders who have held BTC for less than six months. These investors are typically more sensitive to market movements. The analyst remarked that the weighted average Realized Price for STHs who have held BTC for one week to six months lies around $91,800, suggesting that these investors are currently in a loss position. The three months to six months STH cohort has a Realized Price of $86,100, denoting a strong resistance level for the digital asset in the short-term. Notably, this group of holders has the highest share of Realized Cap among STHs, hinting that selling pressure could magnify around this price level. With regard to major support levels, long-term holders (LTH) with a holding time of six months to twelve months have a Realized Price of $63,700. The post adds: The highest volume profile over the past year is concentrated around $64,000. This reinforces the idea that this area could serve as a strong support level. If BTC fails to clear some of its immediate resistance levels, there is a high possibility that it may follow Arthur Hayes prediction of finding a bottom around $70,000. That said, several indicators suggest that BTC may be undervalued at its current market price. At press time, BTC trades at $81,745, up 0.7% in the past 24 hours.

While the correction was slow and draining to the industry, investors speculate a strong, perhaps even sudden, surge that may propel prices to their earlier higher range. In this scenario, some altcoins are likely to go up alongside Bitcoin. These are most likely to be leading altcoins, alongside those that have been trending. Here are the top 6 most popular projects to consider for major gains as the market recovers again back to its original price ranges. Best Crypto to Buy Now BTC Bull As Bitcoin inches toward the $100k mark, BTC Bull has been capturing attention for its strong ties to the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Unlike speculative projects with no clear direction, BTC Bull embraces Bitcoin’s growth, rewarding its holders with airdrops whenever key milestones are achieved. This makes it not just a token to hold but one that actively benefits investors during bullish market movements. The presale is seeing heavy demand, with the token inching closer to selling out. As previous trends have shown, projects that gain traction before launch often experience significant price jumps once they hit the open market. Those waiting for Bitcoin’s breakout may find BTC Bull to be a timely addition, as its growth potential is directly influenced by Bitcoin’s increasing dominance. Adding to its appeal is its branding, which features a powerful bull mascot draped in Bitcoin imagery. This visual representation reinforces its commitment to the Bitcoin ecosystem, positioning it as a meme coin with a clear and relevant narrative. With market conditions improving, BTC Bull’s ability to tap into Bitcoin’s momentum could make it a major gainer in the short to mid-term. As social media buzz continues to grow, it’s becoming increasingly evident that many traders see BTC Bull as a top pick ahead of the next big market surge. MIND of Pepe MIND of Pepe isn’t just another meme-driven crypto—it takes the concept a step further by integrating AI, allowing it to function as an active market participant rather than a passive asset. The project has been making waves due to its AI-driven nature, which enables it to interact with social media trends, analyze market sentiment, and even generate its own opinions. AI remains one of the strongest narratives in the crypto space, and when combined with the ever-growing appeal of meme coins, it creates a powerful fusion that could lead to rapid growth. If investor enthusiasm for AI-related tokens continues, MIND of Pepe could see heightened interest and, subsequently, stronger price action as it gains traction. Beyond its concept, the project has also been seeing strong community support, which is a crucial factor for any meme coin’s success. Social media engagement plays a significant role in determining whether a project can sustain momentum, and MIND of Pepe’s AI-driven mechanics give it an edge in maintaining relevance. The project has raised over $7 million too, which is another reason why it could be a good idea to invest in the project—trend-based demand. As the market recovers, assets that align with popular narratives tend to gain the most traction. Given its dual appeal to AI and meme investors, MIND of Pepe could be positioned for a strong surge if the current demand persists and listings bring in additional volume. Solana Solana has firmly established itself as one of the top-performing blockchains, offering high-speed transactions and significantly lower fees compared to many competitors. Despite market fluctuations, it has continued to attract developers, users, and projects, solidifying its role as a major player in the industry. During previous bull runs, Solana has been one of the strongest-performing altcoins, and its ability to sustain momentum even in bearish conditions suggests that it could be primed for another surge. With institutional interest rising and the blockchain ecosystem expanding, Solana’s current price levels may represent a strong accumulation zone for those anticipating its next breakout. Another key factor driving Solana’s growth is its increasing adoption in DeFi, NFTs, and other decentralized applications. As the market turns bullish, projects built on Solana tend to benefit from increased activity, leading to greater demand for SOL itself. At about $125 per token , SOL could definitely be considered to be at an excellent price point right now. With Bitcoin stabilizing and setting the stage for another rally, Solana remains one of the most closely watched altcoins. Historically, it has been a top choice for traders looking for high returns, and if the market sees a strong rebound, SOL could once again emerge as one of the biggest winners. Best Wallet Token Best Wallet Token has been making waves as one of the most sought-after utility-based crypto presales. As part of the Best Wallet ecosystem, it plays a critical role in facilitating transactions, staking, and exclusive user benefits within the platform. With demand surging, the presale is nearing a significant fundraising milestone, indicating strong investor confidence in its long-term potential. What makes Best Wallet particularly interesting right now is its positioning within a rapidly growing sector. With more investors looking for secure and efficient ways to manage their assets across multiple chains, Best Wallet’s multi-chain compatibility gives it an edge. Unlike many wallets that focus on a single ecosystem, Best Wallet supports over 60 blockchains, offering seamless integration for users navigating DeFi, trading, and portfolio management. Beyond its core functionality, the token itself is expected to play a key role in the ecosystem, offering transaction discounts, staking rewards, and exclusive access to new features. The presale has already demonstrated strong momentum, and once the token launches, its utility-driven demand could further drive price appreciation. As the broader market gears up for another bullish phase, Best Wallet Token could be one of the most stable yet high-reward options for those seeking a long-term hold with tangible benefits within an expanding crypto infrastructure. Meme Index Meme coins have gone from being a niche trend to a legitimate asset class, with many outperforming traditional cryptocurrencies. However, investing in them can often feel like navigating a minefield. Meme Index simplifies this by offering a structured way to gain exposure to meme coins through a risk-based indexing system. The project features four distinct indexes, allowing investors to choose their level of exposure based on risk appetite. This eliminates the need for extensive research while still offering a way to participate in the booming meme coin market. As mainstream adoption of crypto expands, the idea of structured investing in meme coins is gaining traction, making Meme Index a forward-thinking approach to what has traditionally been a highly volatile space. The project has already raised over $4 million, further proving that investors see value in this concept. Additionally, influential crypto YouTuber Austin Hilton has discussed the project in his videos, adding further credibility to its potential. With the broader market recovering, meme coins tend to see exaggerated price movements, making Meme Index a particularly interesting option. For those looking to gain exposure to meme coins without having to pick individual tokens, this project could be a strong mid-term play with significant upside potential. Cardano Cardano has long been a favorite among long-term investors due to its strong development focus and methodical approach to blockchain innovation. While its growth has been more gradual compared to other major altcoins, its consistent network upgrades and increasing adoption have positioned it as a solid choice for those looking beyond short-term hype. One of Cardano’s key strengths lies in its research-driven development model. Unlike many blockchains that rush into trends, Cardano implements upgrades only after thorough peer review and testing, ensuring long-term sustainability. This has made it a reliable option, particularly for investors looking for a more stable alternative in the often volatile crypto market. As the market recovers, large-cap altcoins with strong ecosystems are likely to see renewed interest. Cardano’s ecosystem has continued expanding, with more dApps, DeFi protocols, and real-world partnerships coming to the network. With its staking model offering attractive yields and the blockchain becoming more efficient, ADA could see increased demand in the coming months, potentially soaring above the $0.7 range that it currently is in. For those looking for an asset that balances growth potential with a more structured development approach, Cardano remains a viable choice. If the market sees a broader rally, ADA’s historical performance suggests that it could be well-positioned to benefit from renewed investor interest. Conclusion A well-balanced crypto portfolio isn’t just about picking random tokens—it requires identifying projects that are either trending, in their early stages, or sitting at attractive price levels. At the same time, factors like real-world utility and strong market appeal play a crucial role in determining long-term success. The projects highlighted above check these boxes, making them strong candidates for those looking to capitalize on the next wave of market growth. Trending tokens often gain traction quickly, while early-stage projects present opportunities to get in before major price jumps. Meanwhile, assets at key price points with strong fundamentals can provide a more stable yet high-upside investment. The key is to strike a balance between speculation and tangible value, ensuring that each asset held has a solid case for potential growth. While no investment comes without risk, carefully selecting cryptos that align with market sentiment and industry trends can lead to significant rewards. By staying informed and making calculated decisions, investors can position themselves for gains as the market continues its upward trajectory.

The latest readings from the Crypto Fear & Greed Index are flashing red, indicating a significant shift in crypto sentiment . The index, a key barometer of market emotions, has taken a sharp downturn, signaling increased fear among investors. Let’s dive into what this means for you and the broader crypto market . What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and Why Does It Matter? The Fear and Greed Index , a creation of Alternative.me, isn’t just another number; it’s a powerful tool designed to gauge the overall mood of the cryptocurrency market. Think of it as a sentiment thermometer for crypto. It operates on a scale from 0 to 100. When the index leans towards 0, it screams ‘Extreme Fear’ – suggesting investors are overly worried, which, paradoxically, can sometimes present buying opportunities. Conversely, when it surges towards 100, it signals ‘Extreme Greed,’ hinting at a market that might be overheating and due for a correction. Why is this index so crucial? Because market psychology plays a massive role in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. Understanding whether the market is driven by fear or greed can provide valuable insights for traders and investors looking to make informed decisions. It’s about sensing the pulse of the market to navigate the choppy waters of crypto trading more effectively. Breaking Down the Factors: What Drives the Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t based on guesswork. It’s calculated using a blend of six key market indicators, each weighted to reflect its influence on overall market sentiment: Volatility (25%): Measures the current and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin, comparing it with the average values over the last 30 and 90 days. Unusually high volatility can signal fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Compares current market momentum and volume against the past 30 and 90-day averages. High buying volumes often indicate greed, while low volumes can suggest fear. Social Media (15%): Analyzes sentiment on social media platforms, primarily Twitter, for crypto-related hashtags. A higher volume of negative posts can contribute to a fear reading. Surveys (15%): Conducts weekly crypto polls to gauge investor sentiment directly. (Note: This method is currently paused). Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Tracks Bitcoin’s dominance in the overall crypto market. Increased Bitcoin dominance can sometimes indicate a flight to safety during fearful times. Google Trends (10%): Analyzes Google Trends data for Bitcoin-related search queries. Surges in searches like “Bitcoin crash” can indicate fear, while searches for “buy Bitcoin” might suggest greed. These factors are meticulously combined to provide a holistic view of the prevailing crypto sentiment . The Plunge to 27: What Does ‘Fear’ Really Mean for the Crypto Market? As of March 14th, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index stands at 27. This isn’t just a minor dip; it’s a significant seven-point drop from the previous day and a substantial 18-point fall from the reading before that. Crucially, this reading firmly plants the index back in the ‘Fear’ zone. But what does a reading of 27 truly signify for the crypto market ? A ‘Fear’ reading suggests that investors are becoming increasingly anxious and risk-averse. This could be triggered by a variety of factors such as: Price Corrections: Sharp drops in cryptocurrency prices are a primary driver of fear. Seeing portfolio values decline rapidly can induce panic selling and heightened anxiety. Market Uncertainty: External economic factors, regulatory news, or geopolitical events can create uncertainty, leading investors to become more cautious and fearful. Negative News Cycles: A barrage of negative news headlines – be it exchange hacks, regulatory crackdowns, or project failures – can dampen market sentiment and push the index into the ‘Fear’ zone. When the index is in ‘Fear,’ it often reflects a market characterized by increased volatility and potential downward pressure on prices. However, seasoned investors also recognize that periods of extreme fear can sometimes present unique buying opportunities. As the adage goes, “Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.” The Fear and Greed Index helps to quantify these market emotions. Navigating Fear: How to Use the Fear & Greed Index in Your Crypto Strategy So, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is flashing ‘Fear’ – now what? This isn’t a crystal ball, but it’s a valuable tool to integrate into your crypto investment strategy. Here’s how you can use it to potentially enhance your decision-making: Actionable Insights: Identify Potential Buying Opportunities: Extreme fear (index values below 25) can signal that the market might be oversold. This doesn’t guarantee an immediate price reversal, but it suggests that assets could be undervalued, presenting a potential entry point for long-term investors. Exercise Caution During Greed: Extreme greed (index values above 75) can be a warning sign of a market bubble. It might be prudent to take profits, reduce exposure, or avoid excessive risk-taking when the market is euphoric. Confirm Market Trends: Use the index in conjunction with other technical and fundamental analysis tools. A ‘Fear’ reading during a downtrend can reinforce the bearish outlook, while a ‘Greed’ reading during an uptrend can strengthen the bullish case. Manage Portfolio Risk: Adjust your portfolio risk based on the prevailing market sentiment. During periods of fear, you might consider hedging strategies or reducing your overall exposure to volatile assets. Example Scenario: Let’s say the Fear and Greed Index is consistently in the ‘Extreme Fear’ zone (below 20) while you believe in the long-term potential of Bitcoin. This could be an opportune moment to dollar-cost average into Bitcoin, buying incrementally over time as prices are potentially suppressed by fear-driven selling. Conversely, if the index is in ‘Extreme Greed’ (above 80) and you’ve seen significant gains in your altcoin portfolio, it might be wise to rebalance and take some profits off the table. Challenges and Caveats: Interpreting the Crypto Fear & Greed Index with Caution While the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a useful sentiment indicator, it’s crucial to understand its limitations and use it judiciously. It’s not a standalone predictor of market movements, and relying solely on it can be misleading. Here are some key considerations: Lagging Indicator: The index reflects past and present market sentiment. It may not always accurately predict future price movements. Sentiment can shift rapidly, and the index might lag behind sudden market changes. External Factors: The index primarily focuses on crypto-specific data. External macroeconomic events, regulatory announcements, or black swan events can significantly impact the crypto market regardless of the Fear & Greed Index reading. Not a Trading Signal: The index should not be treated as a direct buy or sell signal. It’s a sentiment gauge, not a precise trading tool. Always combine it with your own research, risk assessment, and trading strategy. Subjectivity in Interpretation: While the index provides a numerical value, interpreting what constitutes ‘fear’ or ‘greed’ is still somewhat subjective and can vary among investors. Therefore, approach the Fear and Greed Index as one piece of the puzzle in your crypto analysis toolkit. Use it to supplement your understanding of market sentiment , but always conduct thorough research and consider a wide range of factors before making investment decisions. Conclusion: Staying Informed in a Fearful Market The Crypto Fear & Greed Index ‘s recent plunge to 27 serves as a stark reminder of the inherent volatility and emotional swings within the cryptocurrency market. While the ‘Fear’ zone might seem unsettling, understanding and interpreting this sentiment is crucial for navigating the crypto landscape effectively. By incorporating the index into your analysis, alongside other indicators and sound risk management practices, you can make more informed decisions and potentially capitalize on market opportunities, even amidst fear. Remember, knowledge and a balanced perspective are your greatest assets in the dynamic world of crypto investing.

Meanwhile, a Texas federal judge issued a default judgment against Bancor DAO for failing to respond to a class-action lawsuit accusing it of misleading investors about liquidity issues and impermanent loss protection. Additionally, a Delaware court granted a temporary restraining order in a Bitcoin mining dispute, preventing Mawson Hosting from blocking access to 21,000 mining rigs amid a payment conflict with Consensus Colocation. Bankruptcy Court Sides With Three Arrows Capital A US bankruptcy court authorized the liquidators of the defunct crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) to increase their claim against the collapsed exchange FTX, raising it from $120 million to $1.53 billion. The ruling was issued by Chief Judge John Dorsey in the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware on March 13, and it dismissed arguments from FTX’s debtors that the amended proof of claim from 3AC liquidators was untimely and aimed at delaying the bankruptcy proceedings. Dorsey found that 3AC liquidators gave sufficient notice of their claim and their intention to amend it after conducting a thorough review of all available data. He also attributed any delays in the filing process to FTX’s failure to provide the relevant records in a timely manner. He mentioned that the evidence indicated that the liquidators were very thorough in their information search, but FTX’s debtors repeatedly withheld crucial data despite having it in their possession. Originally, 3AC liquidators filed a $120 million claim in June of 2023 as part of FTX’s bankruptcy case. In November 2024, they expanded their claim due to allegations of breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and breach of fiduciary duty. According to the liquidators, FTX held $1.53 billion in hedge fund assets that were liquidated in 2022 to settle $1.33 billion in liabilities. They argued that these transactions were avoidable and caused harm to 3AC creditors while accusing FTX debtors of intentionally delaying the release of information that would have shed light on the liquidation. FTX’s debtors objected to the revised claim, and argued that the original proof of claim lacked enough details to notify them about the true nature and extent of 3AC’s allegations. They also held firm that the amendment came too late and should not be allowed. However, the court sided with 3AC by ruling that the amendment was justified given the circumstances. FTX filed for bankruptcy in November of 2022, and has been aggressively working to recover lost funds. In November 2024, the exchange launched multiple lawsuits, including one against SkyBridge Capital and its founder, Anthony Scaramucci, to reclaim funds that former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried allegedly misused for sponsorship and investment deals. Another legal battle targeted Binance and its former CEO, Changpeng Zhao, seeking to recover $1.76 billion in cryptocurrency sent to Binance as part of a repurchase deal in July 2021. Texas Court Rules Against Bancor DAO 3AC is not the only company with its hands full legally. A Texas federal judge issued a default judgment against Bancor DAO after the decentralized finance platform failed to respond to an online summons. Judge Robert Pitman granted the judgment after Bancor DAO’s absence in court after being summoned through a forum post in January of 2024. The ruling was confirmed on March 13 by district court clerk Philip Delvin, who stated that the defendant failed to answer or defend itself in the required timeframe. The class action lawsuit was filed in May of 2023, and it involves investors who claim they lost tens of millions of dollars due to Bancor’s failure to warn them about liquidity issues during a surge in withdrawals in 2022. Plaintiffs argue that Bancor misled investors about its impermanent loss protection (ILP) mechanism for liquidity providers and that its token functioned as an unregistered security. They claim that Bancor’s ILP was operating at a deficit, and in an attempt to cover its losses, the platform introduced a new product that promised high returns without exposing users to risk. Impermanent loss happens when liquidity providers in automated market maker models deposit assets into a pool, and the value of one token declines relative to the other. Bancor suspended its impermanent loss protection feature in June of 2022 due to adverse market conditions, which is a move that plaintiffs argue was not properly disclosed to investors. The lawsuit also contends that Bancor DAO functions as an “unincorporated general partnership” consisting of vBNT tokenholders, making it eligible to be sued as such. While the case was initially dismissed due to the protocol developers being located outside the United States, it was reopened in December. Plaintiffs pointed out that Bancor does not seem to be registered in any jurisdiction and lacks a physical office, mailing address, corporate officers, directors, or appointed agents. Bancor operates as an on-chain liquidity protocol that is designed for decentralized asset exchanges across multiple blockchains. According to DeFiLlama, the platform currently holds $38 million in total value locked, which is a 98% decline from its peak in May 2021. This ruling was made after legal precedent from a very similar case in which the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) won a default judgment against Ooki DAO . In another related case, a California federal judge ruled in November that DAOs and their governing members could be sued in instances involving unregistered securities. Bitcoin Mining Dispute Heats Up Meanwhile, a Delaware court granted a temporary restraining order in favor of Bitcoin miner Consensus Colocation and systems owner Stone Ridge Ventures, preventing hosting provider Mawson Hosting from blocking access to 21,000 mining rigs amid a payment dispute. Vice Chancellor Morgan Zurn issued the order on March 12, barring Mawson from using the hashrate from the miners or restricting Consensus’ access to the facility in Midland, Pennsylvania, until a preliminary injunction hearing. The dispute centers around alleged unpaid fees, contract terms, and Consensus’ plan to relocate its mining equipment. Consensus claims that Mawson has been operating the rigs for its own gain since Feb. 28 while preventing Consensus personnel from accessing them. Mawson argues it has the right to use the rigs under its agreement with Consensus and claims unpaid fees and electricity prepayments justify redirecting the hashrate. In a March 6 legal complaint, Consensus accused Mawson of generating daily profits of $100,000 to $200,000 from mining Bitcoin using its $30 million worth of rigs while blocking both physical and digital access. Consensus and Stone Ridge initially signed a colocation agreement with Mawson in December of 2023, with plans to terminate the partnership by March of 2025 and gradually reduce capacity. Mawson argues that its contract allows for hashrate redirection under specific conditions, but Consensus’ lawyers argue that when Mawson began mining on Feb. 28, the deposit was fully paid. They also allege that Mawson’s actions far exceeded the $17,505.45 in late fees it claims Consensus owes. For now, the restraining order remains in place while the case moves forward.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,MINING|REGULATION|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-14 09:43:34

While meme coins are often known for their volatility, there’s always a new opportunity to consider. Currently, three meme coins are catching the attention of investors: Arctic Pablo Coin (APC), Brett, and Sudeng.

The latest update shows that Brett has made significant strides in developing its community and expanding its outreach. It’s becoming evident that Brett has the potential to gain major traction in the market, particularly as more investors begin to take note of its growth. Sudeng: The Underdog of the Meme Coin Space While Sudeng may not be as talked about as Arctic Pablo Coin or Brett, its recent advancements have garnered attention in the crypto space. Sudeng’s community engagement and unique approach to tokenomics have sparked discussions across forums and social media, making it one to watch. Whether or not Sudeng can capitalize on this momentum remains to be seen, but its continued development could make it a hidden gem in the meme coin market.

Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President took the oath of office earlier this year, the administration has put in place efforts to reset the bilateral relations with Russia.

Earlier this week, police in the Indian state of Kerala arrested Aleksej Besciokov for his involvement in the Garantex exchange and soon will face the charges in the United States. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : U.S. Senate Banking Committee Advances Stablecoin Bill with Bipartisan Support; Full Senate Vote Next , Market Implication The use of crypto assets to facilitate the Russian oil trade business will have a profound effect on their market outlook. More countries that have been sanctioned by the United States and Western countries will follow in the same direction. Moreover, cryptocurrencies offer a seamless transfer of value 24/7 365 days a year compared to the rigid traditional banking sector. Consequently, the rising demand for Bitcoin and Ethereum will fuel the underlying macro-bullish outlook. Already, the United States has signaled the adoption of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other crypto assets in its strategic crypto reserve . .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

It appears that this could all be part of a major strategy by President Trump to lower inflation, and thereby rates, and so be able to refinance $9 trillion of US debt. Can Bitcoin survive this and even rally to a new high? Trump prepared to let the stock market crash? President Trump has always been the champion of the U.S. stock market. In his previous term in office he would often point to climbing U.S. stocks and give his view that this was a clear sign of a strong and growing U.S. economy. It does now appear, at least for the short-term, that Trump has realised that a great way to bring inflation down would be to let the stock market crash. A falling stock market should certainly take the hot air out of the inflation balloon, deflating it enough that rates can come down, and the $9 trillion of debt maturing this year can be refinanced at much lower interest. Method in the madness It seems there could be method in the madness. From the very beginning of his presidency, Trump has talked about “short-term pain”. He is probably thinking that Biden’s previous “soft landing” strategy was just not going to work, and that a short, sharp, shock would achieve his ends far quicker. A recession looks to be very much on the cards. In on Trump’s game plan, Elon Musk and DOGE are cutting government jobs massively, given that a large part of job creation has come within government over recent years, and a robust jobs figure has been a major factor in preventing a recession thus far. Where does this leave Bitcoin So where does this leave Bitcoin? History tells us that generally, Bitcoin will not rally when the stock market is falling, at least not for any extended period of time. That said, if Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s remarks are anything to go by, that he is “not concerned about a little volatility over three weeks”, the current crash may be just a very painful short-term event. With Bitcoin not far from retesting its hugely strong support base at $70,000, the rally could begin from there. $BTC inverse head and shoulders pattern? Source: TradingView The short-term chart for $BTC shows that the series of lower highs and lower lows are still being made EXCEPT for the most recent correction, where a higher low has just been printed. Interestingly, this last low may turn out to be the right shoulder of an inverse head and shoulders pattern. If the price does break out here, and this pattern plays out, the measured move would take the price back to the top trendline of the wedge. On the other hand, given the dismal state of the stock market, a rejection could certainly happen here. The price could then eventually go down to the major support band, from where a bottoming price action could occur. A huge rally could be coming Source: TradingView The weekly chart displays how the $BTC price is being drawn down to the major support band. However, candle wicks to the downside show how buyers are coming in to push the price back up. The support here is massively strong. This level acted as resistance for a good part of the last bull market, and it took 8 months of this bull market before the price was finally able to punch through. At the bottom of the chart, the Relative Strength Index is foreshadowing a potential bounce. The indicator has come down to the very strong support level at 44.00, and should a bounce take place, this might be the first omen of a coming rally that could be tidal wave esque.

I remember buying my first bag of XRP back in 2017, thinking I’d be retired by now, spoiler: I’m not. But here we are in 2025, and the big question remains, will XRP finally break out? Some say regulation is the key, others point to institutional adoption, but if there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that timing is everything in crypto. If you're looking for an edge in the market, Dawgz AI has you covered. Their high-frequency trading algorithms analyze trends in real time, helping you make smarter moves instead of guessing and hoping. Realistic Timeframes and Expectations for XRP XRP is currently priced at $2.34, showing a 240% increase in the last year. Hitting $20 within this period seems unlikely unless extreme bullish conditions occur. A more reasonable range is $3-$5, considering market trends and liquidity levels. Ripple XRP price prediction from analysts suggests moderate growth if adoption increases. ( source ) Medium-term (2027-2029) With legal clarity and institutional backing, XRP could move toward $10-$15. Continued burn mechanisms and supply adjustments will be crucial for price appreciation. Could XRP hit $20? It’s possible if mass adoption accelerates and utility expands globally. Long-term (2030+) The $20 price target becomes more realistic if Ripple solidifies itself as a banking standard. Coinmarketcap analysts suggest that $10-$20 is achievable if mass adoption, cross-border payments, and DeFi integrations align. However, it would require a drastic reduction in supply or massive institutional demand. XRP Price Prediction: What’s Next for Ripple in 2025?

Frequently Asked Questions What is the price prediction of XRP in 2025? The current XRP price is $2.34, and based on the crypto market trends, analysts predict an XRP market range of $3-$5 in 2025. Growth depends on Ripple Network adoption, regulatory clarity, and market capitalization increases, as seen in the price chart history. How much will 1 XRP be worth in 2030? By 2030, XRP could reach $10-$20 if the Ripple Network gains mainstream adoption. The price chart suggests steady growth, but the XRP market depends on institutional use and overall crypto market expansion, influencing market capitalization. Can XRP reach $50? Unlikely in the near future. The XRP market needs massive demand, higher market capitalization, and widespread Ripple Network adoption. The current XRP price suggests steady growth, but the price chart doesn’t support a $50 target unless drastic changes occur. Will XRP reach $20? It’s possible but challenging. The crypto market must see major institutional adoption, and the Ripple Network needs expanded utility. The XRP market could push toward $20 long-term if demand spikes, as seen in historical price chart trends. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

41638657,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=140132,1741945858,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Crypto Warning: Connolly Exposes Risky US Treasury Reserve Plan Amidst Trump Conflict Concerns,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/connolly-warns-treasury-crypto-reserve/,"Is the U.S. Treasury about to make a risky move in the volatile world of digital assets? A prominent voice in Congress, Rep. Gerry Connolly, is raising serious alarms about a proposed strategic crypto reserve . His concerns, outlined in a recent letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, center around potential conflicts of interest involving former President Donald Trump. This move has sparked debate and questions about the true intentions behind this financial strategy. Let’s unpack the details and understand why this proposal is facing such strong opposition and what it could mean for the future of cryptocurrency. Why is Gerry Connolly Sounding the Alarm on the Crypto Reserve? Rep. Gerry Connolly , a Democrat representing Virginia, has taken a firm stance against the U.S. Treasury’s plans for a strategic crypto reserve . In a letter dated March 13, addressed to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Connolly articulated his deep apprehensions about the initiative. According to a press release from the Oversight Committee Democrats, Connolly’s primary worry revolves around the potential for conflicts of interest involving President Donald Trump. He argues that this reserve, instead of serving the American public’s best interests, could become a lucrative venture primarily benefiting the former president and his influential donors. Key Concerns Raised by Rep. Connolly: Conflict of Interest: Connolly explicitly points to potential conflicts of interest related to President Trump, suggesting the reserve could be designed to enrich him and his associates rather than benefit the nation. Lack of Transparency and Consultation: The Congressman emphasized that the proposal for a strategic crypto reserve was developed without any consultation with Congress. This lack of transparency raises questions about the decision-making process and the rationale behind the initiative. Benefit to Whom?: Connolly questions who would truly benefit from this reserve, asserting it’s unlikely to serve the broader American public and instead could be a vehicle for private gain. What is a Strategic Crypto Reserve and Why Now? The concept of a strategic crypto reserve , while still vague in its specifics, suggests the U.S. Treasury might be considering holding a significant amount of cryptocurrency assets, similar to how nations maintain reserves of gold or foreign currencies. The rationale behind such a move is not explicitly stated in the available information, but we can infer potential motivations: Possible Reasons for a Crypto Reserve: Geopolitical Strategy: In an increasingly digital world, nations might view cryptocurrency holdings as a strategic asset in international finance and trade. Financial Innovation: Governments may want to engage more directly with the cryptocurrency market, possibly to understand and regulate it better, or even to leverage its potential for economic growth. Market Influence: Holding a substantial crypto reserve could give the U.S. Treasury more influence in the cryptocurrency market, potentially impacting prices and market trends. However, without clear communication from the US Treasury , these remain speculative. Rep. Connolly’s letter underscores the urgency for clarity and public discussion before such a significant financial strategy is implemented. The Shadow of Trump Conflict: A Legitimate Concern? The core of Gerry Connolly ’s argument rests on the potential Trump conflict of interest. While the specifics of how President Trump might benefit are not detailed in the press release, the implication is clear: Connolly suspects that individuals connected to or aligned with Trump could leverage the strategic crypto reserve for personal financial gain. Understanding the Conflict Concerns: Lack of Detail: The absence of specifics from the Treasury regarding the reserve’s structure and management raises suspicions. Who would manage the reserve? How would assets be acquired and secured? Lack of clarity fuels concerns about potential manipulation. Political Climate: Given the highly polarized political landscape in the U.S., any initiative perceived as benefiting a specific political faction, especially one associated with controversial figures, is likely to face intense scrutiny and opposition. Public Trust: Concerns about conflicts of interest can erode public trust in government institutions. Connolly’s letter appears to be an attempt to preemptively address these trust issues and demand transparency. Whether these concerns are substantiated or not, the fact that a senior member of Congress is publicly voicing them highlights the sensitivity and potential risks associated with establishing a strategic crypto reserve without proper oversight and public discourse. Cryptocurrency Regulation and the Role of the US Treasury This situation unfolds against a backdrop of increasing global attention to cryptocurrency regulation . Governments worldwide are grappling with how to manage and oversee the rapidly evolving digital asset space. The US Treasury plays a pivotal role in shaping financial regulations and policies in the United States. Its stance on cryptocurrency has significant implications for the industry’s future, both domestically and internationally. The US Treasury’s Influence on Crypto Regulation: Policy Setting: The Treasury Department is instrumental in formulating policies related to financial crimes, taxation, and economic sanctions, all of which directly impact the cryptocurrency sector. Enforcement: Agencies under the Treasury, like FinCEN (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) and the IRS (Internal Revenue Service), are responsible for enforcing regulations related to cryptocurrency transactions and businesses. International Cooperation: The Treasury engages with international bodies to develop global standards for cryptocurrency regulation, influencing how other nations approach digital assets. Rep. Connolly’s intervention underscores the need for any US Treasury initiative in the cryptocurrency space to be transparent, well-justified, and clearly in the public interest. It also emphasizes the ongoing tension between fostering innovation in the digital asset realm and mitigating potential risks, including financial crime and undue influence. Is a Strategic Crypto Reserve a Risky Bet for America? The question remains: is establishing a strategic crypto reserve a prudent or perilous path for the United States? Proponents might argue it’s a forward-thinking move, positioning the U.S. at the forefront of digital finance and providing a new tool for economic and geopolitical strategy. However, critics, like Rep. Connolly, raise valid concerns about risks and potential downsides. Potential Risks of a Crypto Reserve: Market Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is notoriously volatile. Holding a large reserve could expose the U.S. to significant financial risks if the market experiences a downturn. Security Concerns: Securing vast amounts of digital assets from hacking and theft is a considerable challenge. A strategic reserve would be a high-value target for cybercriminals. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency is still evolving. Unclear regulations could create legal and operational complexities for managing a crypto reserve . Ethical Considerations: As Connolly highlights, ethical concerns around conflicts of interest and the potential for misuse of public funds are paramount. Conclusion: Demanding Transparency and Public Interest Rep. Gerry Connolly ’s forceful opposition to the US Treasury ’s strategic crypto reserve plan throws a spotlight on the critical need for transparency, public consultation, and ethical considerations in government initiatives related to cryptocurrency. His concerns about potential Trump conflict of interest and the lack of congressional consultation are serious and warrant thorough investigation and public debate. As the U.S. navigates the complex world of digital assets, it’s imperative that any strategic moves are demonstrably in the best interest of the American public, not just a select few. The future of cryptocurrency regulation and adoption in the U.S. hinges on decisions made with careful consideration, transparency, and a commitment to serving the broader public good. This situation serves as a stark reminder of the powerful intersection of politics, finance, and the burgeoning world of cryptocurrency.

The Green Mountain State has decided to drop its legal action against the crypto giant concerning its staking offerings. This news, shared by Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer (CLO) Paul Grewal, marks a potentially pivotal moment in the ongoing debate about crypto regulation in the United States. Is this dismissal a sign of changing tides in how staking services are viewed legally? Let’s dive into the details of this developing story and explore what it means for Coinbase, the broader crypto landscape, and the future of staking services . Why is the Vermont Coinbase Case Significant for Crypto Regulation? The dismissal of the Vermont case against Coinbase isn’t just a win for the exchange; it carries broader implications for crypto regulation across the U.S. Here’s why this development is noteworthy: Validation of Coinbase’s Stance: Coinbase has consistently argued that its staking services are not securities. Vermont dropping the legal action can be interpreted as a tacit acknowledgment of this position, or at least a recognition that pursuing the case might be legally challenging. Precedent Setting Potential: While each state’s regulatory environment is unique, a dismissal like this in Vermont could influence other states’ approaches to regulating crypto staking. It may deter other states from pursuing similar legal actions without stronger grounds. Fuel for Industry Advocacy: This victory provides ammunition for Coinbase and other crypto firms to advocate for clearer and more favorable crypto regulation at both the state and federal levels. It strengthens their argument that existing securities laws are ill-suited for innovative crypto services like staking. Investor Confidence Boost: Positive legal developments, like this dismissal, can boost investor confidence in Coinbase and the crypto market in general. It signals a potentially less hostile regulatory environment, which is crucial for market growth and stability. What Exactly are Staking Services and Why are They Under Regulatory Scrutiny? To understand the Vermont case and its significance, it’s essential to grasp what staking services are and why they’ve become a regulatory focal point. In simple terms: Staking Explained: Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Networks: Many modern cryptocurrencies, like Ethereum, operate on a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. This is an energy-efficient alternative to Proof-of-Work (used by Bitcoin). Validating Transactions: In PoS, users can “stake” their crypto holdings to participate in validating transactions on the blockchain and securing the network. Earning Rewards: By staking, users earn rewards, typically in the form of additional units of the staked cryptocurrency. This is often likened to earning interest on savings. Staking Services by Exchanges: Crypto exchanges like Coinbase offer staking services , making it easier for users to participate in staking without needing technical expertise. They pool users’ assets and handle the technical complexities of staking, distributing rewards proportionally. Regulatory Scrutiny: Securities or Not? The central regulatory question is whether staking services constitute securities under existing laws. If deemed securities, they would be subject to stringent registration and compliance requirements. SEC’s Position: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been actively investigating and taking enforcement actions against crypto firms offering staking services, arguing that they often meet the definition of securities. State-Level Actions: Alongside federal scrutiny, some U.S. states, like Vermont, have also initiated legal actions related to staking services, adding another layer of complexity for crypto exchanges. Paul Grewal’s Perspective: A Call for Crypto Legislation Paul Grewal , Coinbase’s CLO, has been a vocal advocate for regulatory clarity in the crypto space. His statement on X regarding the Vermont case underscores Coinbase’s consistent position and highlights the need for legislative action. Key takeaways from Grewal’s statement: Consistent Stance: Grewal reiterated that Coinbase has always maintained that its staking services are not securities. This dismissal from Vermont appears to validate this long-held position. Urgency for Legislation: He emphasized the pressing need for Congress to step in and pass comprehensive crypto legislation . Grewal argues that such legislation should specifically address the unique characteristics of crypto services like staking, moving beyond applying potentially outdated securities laws. Innovation vs. Regulation: The call for legislation reflects the broader industry concern that overly broad or ill-fitting regulations could stifle innovation in the rapidly evolving crypto sector. A clear legal framework is seen as essential for fostering responsible growth and protecting consumers without hindering progress. What Does This Mean for the Future of Coinbase Staking and Crypto? The Vermont dismissal, while a positive development, is just one piece of the larger regulatory puzzle. What can we realistically expect moving forward? Potential Benefits: Reduced Legal Uncertainty: This win, along with potential future positive legal outcomes, can gradually reduce the legal uncertainty surrounding Coinbase staking and similar services. Focus on Federal Legislation: The industry’s focus is likely to intensify on pushing for federal crypto legislation . Vermont’s decision might embolden lawmakers to consider more nuanced approaches to crypto regulation. Continued SEC Scrutiny: It’s important to note that this Vermont case doesn’t necessarily signal a change in the SEC’s stance. The SEC is likely to continue its regulatory efforts concerning staking and other crypto services. Global Regulatory Landscape: The U.S. regulatory environment is just one aspect. The global regulatory landscape for crypto is diverse and evolving. Coinbase and other exchanges operate internationally and must navigate varying rules and regulations across different jurisdictions. Actionable Insights: What Should Crypto Users and Investors Do? For crypto users and investors, the Vermont dismissal and the broader crypto regulation debate offer several actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of regulatory developments at both the state and federal levels. Follow industry news, legal updates, and statements from regulatory bodies like the SEC. Understand Staking Risks: Whether you use Coinbase staking or other platforms, understand the risks involved, including regulatory risks and platform-specific risks. Advocate for Clarity: If you are a crypto user or investor, consider engaging with policymakers and advocating for clear and sensible crypto regulations that foster innovation while protecting consumers. Diversify and Manage Risk: As always in the crypto space, diversification and prudent risk management are key. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, and be prepared for regulatory changes that could impact the market. Conclusion: A Ray of Hope, But the Journey Continues Vermont dismissing its legal action against Coinbase over staking is undoubtedly a positive signal for the exchange and potentially for the broader crypto industry. It offers a ray of hope for a more balanced and informed approach to crypto regulation . However, it’s crucial to remember that this is just one battle in an ongoing regulatory journey. The need for comprehensive crypto legislation in the U.S. remains as pressing as ever. As Paul Grewal rightly points out, the onus is now on Congress to create a clear and workable legal framework that allows for innovation to flourish while addressing legitimate regulatory concerns. The crypto world will be watching closely to see what steps lawmakers take next.

The fundraising campaign, which began in October 2024, underwent multiple phases, with adjustments to the initial funding goal and additional token offerings to accommodate shifting market demand. Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial Closes $550M Fundraising Round President Donald Trump’s crypto project, World Liberty Financial, has successfully concluded its fundraising efforts with a substantial $550 million raised. The initiative initially targeted $300 million but faced challenges in early stages, leading to a revised goal. Despite these hurdles, subsequent offerings sparked renewed investor interest, allowing WLFI to exceed its revised expectations by a significant margin. The sale’s first phase ended on January 20, distributing 20% of the total token supply. High-profile investors, including Justin Sun, contributed to the early momentum. The surge in demand led to an additional issuance of 5 billion tokens on the same day, priced at $0.05 each, which were nearly sold out by March 13. This development comes just days after the Trump-backed crypto project announced the SUI Strategic Reserve , further solidifying its commitment to decentralized finance. The move has sparked excitement in the crypto community, driving a notable surge in SUI’s price. Token Lock-up and Utility Details World Liberty Financial has implemented a 12-month lock-up period for all purchased tokens, a move that prevents any immediate trading and reflects a cautious approach to market integration. This governance token enables holders to submit and vote on proposals within the WLFI Protocol. However, it does not provide financial returns, ownership rights, or any direct economic benefits, emphasizing its utility strictly within governance. The tokens require an ERC-compatible wallet for transactions, and investors had to complete necessary KYC and AML verifications to participate. More so, token distribution for designated wallets was scheduled for the end of the sale period, with all buyers fully responsible for the risks associated with their investment. Market Challenges and Portfolio Performance Despite raising a significant sum, World Liberty Financial faced setbacks as its cryptocurrency portfolio experienced substantial losses. Initially, the project allocated $336 million to acquire various digital assets. However, market declines led to a devaluation, with the total value dropping to $226 million as of March 10. Ethereum, which constituted 65% of WLFI’s holdings, saw a decline from an average purchase price of $3,240 per token to around $1,896. This drop impacted the overall value of the portfolio, contributing to the $110 million loss. Other assets in the portfolio also suffered from the downturn, underscoring the volatility in the crypto markets. However, despite the challenges, earlier today, Donald Trump’s DeFi project acquired 541,242 SEI tokens, pushing SEI price up by 7%. This investment underscores WLFI’s continued confidence in the altcoin market, even as its broader crypto portfolio faces losses.

A Tron (TRX) address, holding a substantial 11 million USDT, has been frozen. This move, as revealed by the crypto tracking platform MistTrack on X (formerly Twitter), is reportedly due to suspicions linking the address to nefarious phishing activities. What does this mean for the crypto space, and more importantly, for you as a crypto user? Let’s dive deep into this developing story. Urgent Tether Freeze on Tron Address: Unpacking the Situation The news of Tether freezing a Tron address has sent ripples through the crypto community. But what exactly happened? Here’s a breakdown of the key facts: The Freeze: Tether, responsible for issuing USDT, the most widely used stablecoin, has frozen a specific Tron network address. Significant Amount: The frozen address contained approximately 11 million USDT, a considerable sum indicating potentially large-scale operations. Phishing Suspicions: Crypto tracking firm MistTrack flagged the address, suggesting a correlation between its activities and phishing schemes. Platform Announcement: MistTrack made the announcement publicly on X, bringing immediate attention to the incident. This action by Tether highlights the ongoing battle against illicit activities within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. But why is Tether taking such measures, and what are the broader implications? Why Tether Takes Action Against Suspicious USDT Addresses Tether’s decision to freeze the Tron address holding 11M USDT is not arbitrary. It’s rooted in a commitment to maintaining the integrity and security of the USDT stablecoin and the wider crypto market. Here are some crucial reasons behind such actions: Combating Illicit Activities: Cryptocurrencies, while offering immense potential, can unfortunately be exploited for illegal activities like phishing, scams, and money laundering. Tether, as a major player, takes responsibility in curbing such misuse. Regulatory Compliance: Stablecoin issuers are increasingly under regulatory scrutiny. Freezing addresses linked to suspicious activities demonstrates a proactive approach to compliance and cooperation with law enforcement agencies. Protecting Users: Phishing scams can lead to significant financial losses for individuals. By freezing addresses associated with these activities, Tether aims to protect users from becoming victims of fraud. Maintaining Trust: The credibility of USDT, and by extension, the stablecoin market, depends on trust. Taking swift action against illicit activities helps maintain this trust and confidence in the system. However, it’s important to remember that freezing an address is a serious step, and it’s usually taken after careful consideration and investigation. Platforms like MistTrack play a vital role in identifying and flagging potentially malicious addresses. Tron Address and the USDT Freeze: What is the Connection? The fact that the frozen address is on the Tron network is also noteworthy. Tron has become a popular blockchain for USDT transactions due to its lower fees and faster transaction spTether freezeeeds compared to some other networks. This popularity, however, also makes it a target for illicit activities. Here’s why the Tron network is relevant in this context: USDT on Tron: A significant portion of USDT in circulation exists on the Tron blockchain. Its efficiency and cost-effectiveness have made it a preferred choice for many users and exchanges. Transaction Volume: The high volume of USDT transactions on Tron means there’s a greater potential for both legitimate and illegitimate activities to occur. Accessibility: While accessibility is a benefit, it can also be exploited by those seeking to move funds quickly and discreetly, including funds from phishing scams. Therefore, while the Tron network itself is not inherently problematic, its characteristics make it a landscape where vigilance and security measures are paramount. The Tron Foundation and the wider community are continuously working on enhancing network security and combating illicit activities. Phishing Activities and Crypto: A Dangerous Combination Phishing, a deceptive tactic to steal sensitive information, is a persistent threat in the digital world, and the cryptocurrency space is no exception. How does phishing manifest in crypto, and why is it so dangerous? Deceptive Tactics: Phishing typically involves creating fake websites, emails, or messages that mimic legitimate platforms (like exchanges or wallets) to trick users into revealing their private keys, passwords, or seed phrases. Financial Gain: The goal of crypto phishing is almost always financial gain. Once attackers obtain access to a user’s wallet or account, they can drain funds quickly. Emotional Manipulation: Phishing attacks often employ urgency, fear, or excitement to cloud judgment and pressure victims into acting without thinking critically. Evolving Techniques: Phishing methods are constantly evolving, becoming more sophisticated and harder to detect. This requires users to be perpetually vigilant and informed. The connection between the frozen Tron address and suspected phishing activities underscores the need for robust security measures and user education in the crypto space. Platforms like MistTrack are crucial in identifying and tracking these threats. Crypto Security: Actionable Insights to Protect Yourself News like the Tether USDT freeze on a Tron address serves as a stark reminder of the importance of crypto security. What can you do to protect yourself from phishing and other threats? Verify Website URLs: Always double-check the website address before entering any sensitive information. Look for HTTPS and the correct domain name. Beware of Suspicious Emails and Messages: Be wary of unsolicited emails or messages asking for personal information or urging immediate action. Legitimate platforms rarely ask for sensitive details via email. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Use 2FA on all your crypto accounts for an extra layer of security. Use Hardware Wallets: For long-term storage of significant crypto holdings, consider using hardware wallets, which offer enhanced security by keeping your private keys offline. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with the latest crypto security threats and best practices. Reputable crypto news sources and security blogs are valuable resources. By taking proactive steps and staying vigilant, you can significantly reduce your risk of falling victim to phishing and other crypto scams. Remember, in the world of crypto, security is paramount. Conclusion: A Call for Vigilance in the Crypto World The Tether freeze of a Tron address holding 11 million USDT due to suspected phishing activities is a significant event. It underscores the ongoing challenges in crypto security and the proactive measures being taken by major players like Tether to combat illicit activities. This incident serves as a critical reminder for all crypto users to remain vigilant, informed, and proactive in securing their digital assets. The fight against crypto crime is a continuous effort, requiring collaboration, innovation, and unwavering attention to security best practices.

Gold futures for April delivery also broke the $3,000 mark on Thursday. The precious metal is now up over 15% this year, driven by strong ETF inflows , geopolitical uncertainty, and continued concerns over U.S. equities amid ongoing tariff discussions by former President Donald Trump. Meanwhile, gold priced in British pounds has yet to reach its all-time high of £2,363, currently sitting around £300 below that level. Charlie Morris , founder of ByTree and manager of the BOLD ETF, which includes both bitcoin and gold, has observed a divergence between gold and bitcoin ETFs and expects this trend to reverse soon. “In the last 30 days, gold ETFs have seen $10 billion in inflows, while bitcoin ETFs have experienced $5 billion in outflows,” Morris noted. “Sooner or later, the flows will reverse again—just as they always do.”Disclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards .

The crypto market has suffered headwinds wiping off gains and forcing retail and institutional traders under sell pressures. This impacted meme coin prices, sparking major exits. DOGE Holders Eyes Major Uptick Crypto trader Ali Martinez wrote on X that Dogecoin remains at key support and could record a quick rebound. Increased market activity and volume have fueled this optimism for many traders. Despite the recent price dip, active addresses have risen by 47% to 163,000 in the last 30 days. DOGE price rose 2.21% to $0.1684 with bulls locked in on hitting $0.5 in the next cycle peak. A slew of traders have also pitched a higher price range for the asset. These holders point to the $1 mark as the bull level amid a crash in confidence. Last week, the asset dipped 19% extending monthly outflows to 35.9%. This caused a ripple effect in other meme coins plunging into the red zone . Price swings in DOGE, the largest meme coin by market cap have a similar effect on other assets. Shiba Inu fell 11% this week while Official Trump and BONK plummeted 22% and 19% respectively. However recent optimism from DOGE holders looks to ignite other meme coins. Furthermore, Martinez explained that a major rebound could be on the cards as the stock relative strength index (RSI) comes close to a bullish crossover. Crypto enthusiast Knock wrote on the potential rebound of PEPE and Solana meme coins. “ Pepe coin shows signs of potential rebound with a falling wedge pattern, bullish divergence, and possible rotation from Solana meme coins. Strong holder base with 17% of whales maintaining positions signals positive outlook.” Wider Crypto Market Notch Gains After weeks in the red zone, several crypto assets show initial recovery signs. Bitcoin whales kicked off accumulation coupled with massive centralized exchange outflows. Institutional investors have also shown renewed interest at some level, although fear remains. With slight gains in Bitcoin, altcoins have traded along similar lines. Over the last trading day, BNB rose 2.8% to $574, while XRP and Solana gained 1.2% and 2.5%, respectively.

The slip below $80k heightened sell pressure, with analysts flagging its movement into oversold territory. When writing, the top crypto exchanges’ hands are at $83,070, a slight 1% gain in the last 24 hours. The wider market also showed recovery signs following weeks in the doldrums. Will Bitcoin Price Reclaim $100k? This year, Bitcoin tapped an all-time high above $108k, with an expected uptick in institutional demand. However, this bull frenzy was short-lived due to US trade wars and a subsequent decline in U.S. tech stocks. The asset’s trading over 20% below the all-time highs weakened sentiments amid bulls’ quest for a recovery. Digital asset analyst Crypto Dan explained that the asset is emerging into an oversold position after weeks of fear. This oversold state can trigger fresh inflows to the market as panic mode plummets. According to Dan, a critical look at whale volumes and global economic trends is important to gauge the level of a rebound. Since the price beat the $87k mark last year, macro trends have heavily influenced the crypto market. For bulls, a recovery based on macro trends and reduced pressure from the US tariff debacle can spur the price to January levels. Apart from macro factors, on-chain factors also show attempts at a reversal. “ However, market sentiment is currently significantly weakened, and altcoins have surrendered most of their gains, leaving the majority of investors with no profits in this cycle. This suggests that even without an additional sharp decline, the market has already been sufficiently lightened, making it a favorable zone for a potential upward move without the need for further significant drops.” Institutional Appetite Needs To Soar For Bitcoin price to reclaim over 20% losses, traders must record huge institutional volumes. At the moment, these investors are selling hedging against losses. Last week’s outflows amounted to a fourth consecutive decline in institutional holdings. However, some investors bought the dip in anticipation of a stronger market. The importance of large-scale investors cannot be overstated, especially given last year’s performance. After the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs , traditional investors took advantage of the new window to increase their market exposure. This attracted nearly $40 billion and created demand for more digital asset-related products.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-14 11:24:01

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/wall-street-veteran-says-this-is-the-year-bitcoin-maxis-will-regret-not-buying-xrp-heres-why/,"Wall Street veteran and author Linda P. Jones recently weighed in on XRP’s potential trajectory for 2025, stating that this is the year Bitcoin maximalists will regret not investing in the altcoin. Her comments came in response to an investor who revealed he had converted his Bitcoin holdings to XRP last year before its rise to a multi-year high. Smart move! I have said this is the year bitcoin maxi's will regret not investing in XRP. https://t.co/Ys92uOlFkk — Linda P. Jones (@LindaPJones) March 12, 2025 XRP’s Phenomenal Performance XRP spent the last two months of 2024 confirming the bullish expectations analysts and loyal investors have held for a long time. The asset rose from around $0.55 in early November to a multi-year peak of $3.39, marking a surge of over 500%. This remarkable performance has reinvigorated the faith of XRP holders, and they believe 2025 will be the year it surpasses its all-time high of $3.84 and potentially reaches double digits . Anticipation of XRP ETF Demand Jones argues that the increasing interest in XRP is evident through the recent XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). According to her, financial companies file for ETFs only when they anticipate demand and potential profitability. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 She dismissed the notion that XRP lacks demand, pointing out that investors have been limited to Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. As new ETF options emerge, many may choose to diversify their holdings, including shifting from BTC and ETH to XRP. Tax Advantages and Institutional Legitimacy Jones also suggested that XRP could receive preferential tax treatment in the U.S. if President Donald Trump chooses to remove taxes on U.S.-based cryptocurrencies. As the largest cryptocurrency in this category, XRP could pull in many investors, potentially causing them to divest from other ETF products. According to Jones, another factor contributing to XRP’s legitimacy is its inclusion in the U.S. government’s Digital Asset Stockpile . Trump’s acknowledgment of XRP in this context may increase institutional and retail investor confidence in the asset. A Turning Point for Crypto Investors? Jones emphasized that many investors prefer to invest in digital assets through ETFs rather than direct purchases. She noted that ETFs provide an easier entry point for those with retirement accounts, such as IRAs, who may have larger capital reserves. This accessibility could drive further adoption of XRP, reinforcing her belief that demand will grow significantly. Jones’s perspective aligns with the broader trend of increasing institutional interest in XRP . If the SEC approves XRP ETFs and potential tax advantages come into play, this could mark a significant turning point for the digital asset, and help it dominate the market.

Earlier this week, Franklin Templeton became the largest asset manager to seek approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for an exchange-traded fund (ETF) based on the price of XRP, the fourth-largest crypto by market cap. Despite multiple issuers filing with the SEC to launch spot XRP funds, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager and Bitcoin and Ether ETF issuer, has avoided the Ripple-promoted token. BlackRock To File For XRP ETF Once Ripple-SEC Lawsuit Is Fully Resolved Notably, BlackRock’s spot BTC and ETH ETFs have both experienced billions in inflows during the last year. BlackRock’s iShares BTC Trust ETF, IBIT, eventually matured enough to surpass its gold ETF in assets under management. ETF Store president Nate Geraci believes the asset management behemoth will only file for an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) once the SEC’s four-year-long lawsuit against Ripple is concluded. The prolonged battle since December 2020 over allegations of unregistered XRP sales may be over soon. The July 2023 ruling by District Judge Analisa Torres of the Southern District of New York, declaring XRP a non-security when sold to retail investors, but fining Ripple $125 million for institutional sales marked a turning point. Recent reports indicate the legal spat between the two parties could soon reach a conclusion, with Ripple negotiating better terms as the regulator adopts a more lenient regulatory stance under acting Chair Mark Uyeda . One final issue reportedly being discussed is a comparison between XRP and Ether. At the core is whether XRP continues to trade and have a utility that makes it more of a commodity than a security. Geraci has also predicted that BlackRock’s Solana ETF could be filed with the SEC any day from now. He doesn’t think the $10 trillion asset manager will simply allow rivals to introduce ETFs baked on the XRP and SOL “without any sort of fight.” Meanwhile, Bloomberg’s Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas has previously penciled in a 65% and 70% chance that XRP ETFs and SOL ETFs, respectively, secure a green light this year. However, he did not forecast the timing. Issuers must still contend with regulatory review, lawsuits, and public comment on the pending applications.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,XRP|BTC|REGULATION|SOL|ETH,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-14 11:27:28

After Canary Capital filed its ETF applicatoin Sui’s (SUI) value increased by 6.4% and the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale defined its phase successfully securing $3.2 million investment so far. Several industry experts predict SUI will reach $20 while MUTM will scale to $10 at some point before August 2025 because institutions are driving momentum through their entrance combined with the innovative lending model. Sui (SUI) Gains Institutional Traction Sui (SUI) managed to surpass key resistance areas when Canary Capital submitted its ETF trust filing which created optimistic investor sentiment. Modern derivatives information reveals that open interest volume surged 15.28% while the token maintained a trading price of $2.85. A falling wedge formation appears on daily charts and the 200-day moving average defines a potential test area according to technical indications. Success at this point could bring SUI toward a target of $4 which might continue to $5.35 until hitting its January peak price. Strategic alliances amplify optimism. World Liberty Financial partnered with SUI to establish a strategic reserve through former U.S. President Donald Trump’s network. Evan Cheng who serves as a Sui contributor explains that this joint effort will drive the platform towards broader practical uses. ETF approvals might initiate a large market influx from institutions which some analysts believe will drive SUI price to $20 after it reaches similar height gains as Bitcoin’s ETF-driven ascent. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) leads the crypto market headlines because its third presale stage draws near to its filling capacity. The project has attracted more than 5,500 holders because its lending protocol generates continuous buy pressure which leads stakeholders to join. MUTM stands at $0.02 during phase three but it will surge to $0.025 when phase four concludes thus delivering instant gains to initial buyers. The platform maintains tokenomics which establishes a $0.06 listing value and delivers triple the current investment value. Early estimations predict MUTM will reach the $5 level after launch but more aggressive models put its value at $10 by mid-2025. The third phase of token value appreciation leads to a staggering 24,900% increase which surpasses almost every DeFi initial offering. Built-In Demand Mechanisms Mutuum Finance (MUTM) sidesteps speculative pitfalls through tangible utility. The lending ecosystem of MUTM enables users to deposit ETH and DAI assets while generating the interest-bearing mtTokens. Users earn tokens equipped with increasing value through their extended use on DeFi platforms thus promoting token holding. The platform revenue acquisition system buys MUTM tokens for distribution among staking members while producing these tokens. The combined mechanism both drives continuous demand while it reduces market liquidations. Market confidence grows significantly during phase three according to market data. The market has detected how the entrance window is closing because entry costs will expand after phase four commences. The current momentum in the presale indicates that investors soon plan to move their funds from current rates to successively more expensive levels because they have already raised $3.2 million. Timing the Opportunity Sui (SUI) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) present divergent yet complementary opportunities. SUI rides regulatory tailwinds and institutional interest, while MUTM leverages DeFi innovation and presale urgency. The MUTM phase three opportunity represents the last access point to purchase tokens for less than $0.025 because exchange listings will activate price appreciation. Market dynamics favor bold moves. As SUI eyes $20 through ETF-driven adoption, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) harnesses organic demand from a functional ecosystem. The initial purchasers obtain exponential value growth through launch discounts thus creating stronger market visibility. Two major market triggers of this strength emerge exceptionally infrequently within the crypto market. SUI (SUI) stabilizes its regulatory achievements as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) approaches its presale’s last affordable acquisition period.

According to a Reuters report , Russian oil companies and traders increasingly conduct transactions in bitcoin and crypto, allowing them to circumvent restrictions from Western nations. Sources say monthly trade volumes are already in the tens of millions of dollars. JUST IN: Russia is using #Bitcoin and crypto in its oil trade with China and India to skirt Western sanctions: Reuters pic.twitter.com/Ld99WAQ1WQ — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) March 14, 2025 The mechanism involves Chinese or Indian buyers purchasing oil and depositing yuan or rupees into an offshore account owned by a middleman company. The middleman then converts the fiat currency into crypto and transfers it to an account in Russia , where it is exchanged into rubles. While crypto-based oil payments are still a fraction of Russia’s $192 billion total oil trade, the practice is growing as sanctions bite. The trend highlights the utility of bitcoin and crypto in enabling transaction settlement for sanctioned nations. Iran and Venezuela have adopted similar crypto strategies. Bitcoin and crypto’s censorship resistance allows value transfer beyond the reach of sanctions. In late 2024, Russia’s finance minister publicly endorsed using crypto in foreign trade. The Kremlin sees bitcoin and crypto as one of several effective strategies to overcome financial penalties imposed over the invasion of Ukraine. The Bank of Russia also recently proposed legalizing crypto investments for wealthy citizens. However, Russia’s oil trade still relies primarily on fiat currencies. President Donald Trump’s administration is debating whether to ease some restrictions to improve relations with Moscow. With the Ukraine conflict still unresolved, Russia’s pivot toward leveraging bitcoin and decentralized technologies appears to aim to reduce its reliance on traditional finance and dollar settlements. Other countries under U.S. sanctions are likely to be monitored closely.

This latest acquisition, executed through the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), involves a substantial purchase of 29,353 Coinbase shares, valued at approximately $5.2 million based on the closing price on March 13th. This follows closely on the heels of a previous investment made earlier this month, where ARK Invest scooped up 64,358 Coinbase shares across two of its exchange-traded funds. What does this persistent bullishness from a major investment firm mean for the future of Coinbase and the broader crypto landscape? Let’s dive into the details of this intriguing development. Why is ARK Invest Doubling Down on Coinbase Shares? Cathie Wood, the CEO and CIO of ARK Invest, is known for her high-conviction investments in disruptive technologies. ARK Invest ‘s decision to further invest in Coinbase shares underscores a strong belief in the long-term potential of both Coinbase as a company and the cryptocurrency market as a whole. Several factors might be driving this strategic accumulation: Confidence in Crypto Market Recovery: Despite market volatility, ARK Invest likely anticipates a significant rebound in the cryptocurrency market. Investing in Coinbase, a key infrastructure player in the crypto space, positions them to benefit directly from increased trading volumes and broader adoption. Coinbase’s Strategic Positioning: Coinbase is not just a cryptocurrency exchange; it’s evolving into a comprehensive crypto-financial services platform. Its focus on compliance, institutional adoption, and expanding product offerings (like Coinbase Prime and Coinbase Cloud) makes it an attractive long-term investment. Valuation Perspective: While Coinbase’s stock price can be volatile, ARK Invest might view the current valuation as attractive for long-term growth, especially considering the potential upside of the crypto market. They may believe Coinbase shares are currently undervalued relative to their future potential. Alignment with ARK’s Investment Philosophy: ARK Invest’s investment strategy centers around identifying and investing in companies involved in ‘disruptive innovation.’ Cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology underpinning them squarely fit within this framework. Cathie Wood and her team see the transformative potential of crypto and believe Coinbase is a crucial player in this revolution. A Closer Look at the ARKK ETF and Crypto Investments The ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) is ARK Invest’s flagship ETF, focusing on companies that are leading innovation across various sectors, including genomics, automation, robotics, energy storage, artificial intelligence, and, significantly, blockchain technology and the internet. The ETF’s portfolio reflects Cathie Wood ‘s vision of future-oriented, high-growth companies. ARKK ETF ‘s exposure to cryptocurrency-related investments is primarily through companies like Coinbase and Block (formerly Square). These investments are not just about short-term gains but are viewed as long-term bets on the evolution of financial systems and the internet. The consistent addition of Coinbase shares to the ARKK portfolio demonstrates a strong, sustained conviction in this space. What Does This Mean for Coinbase and Crypto Investors? ARK Invest’s continued investment in Coinbase sends a powerful signal to the market. Here’s what it could imply for both Coinbase and crypto investors: Positive Market Sentiment: When a prominent investment firm like ARK Invest increases its stake in a company, it often boosts investor confidence. This latest purchase could be interpreted as a strong endorsement of Coinbase and the crypto market’s future prospects, potentially attracting more investors. Validation for Coinbase’s Strategy: ARK Invest’s investment validates Coinbase’s strategic direction and its position in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. It suggests that institutional investors are increasingly recognizing Coinbase’s value proposition beyond just a trading platform. Potential Price Impact: While a single $5.2 million purchase might not dramatically move the needle for a company like Coinbase, the cumulative effect of institutional buying, especially from a high-profile firm like ARK Invest, can contribute to upward price pressure on Coinbase shares over time. Broader Crypto Market Implications: This investment can be seen as a positive sign for the broader cryptocurrency market. It suggests that despite regulatory uncertainties and market fluctuations, major investment players are still bullish on the long-term potential of digital assets. Challenges and Considerations for Coinbase While ARK Invest’s investment is undoubtedly positive news, Coinbase, like all companies in the crypto space, faces challenges. These include: Regulatory Scrutiny: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving and often uncertain. Increased regulatory scrutiny could impact Coinbase’s operations and profitability. Market Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility. Downturns in the market can significantly affect Coinbase’s trading volumes and revenue. Competition: The cryptocurrency exchange market is becoming increasingly competitive, with new players emerging and traditional financial institutions entering the space. Coinbase needs to continually innovate to maintain its market leadership. Technological Risks: As a technology-driven platform, Coinbase is susceptible to cybersecurity threats and technological disruptions. Ensuring robust security and maintaining cutting-edge technology is crucial. Actionable Insights for Investors For investors considering the cryptocurrency market and crypto investment opportunities, ARK Invest’s move provides some valuable insights: Due Diligence is Key: While ARK Invest’s bullishness is notable, it’s essential for individual investors to conduct their own thorough research before investing in Coinbase shares or any cryptocurrency. Understand the risks and rewards involved. Long-Term Perspective: ARK Invest’s investment strategy is long-term oriented. Consider adopting a similar approach when investing in crypto – focus on the long-term potential rather than short-term price fluctuations. Diversification: Diversification is crucial in any investment portfolio, especially in volatile markets like crypto. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Consider diversifying across different cryptocurrencies and crypto-related companies. Stay Informed: The cryptocurrency market is dynamic and rapidly evolving. Stay informed about market trends, regulatory developments, and technological advancements to make informed investment decisions. Conclusion: A Bold Endorsement for Crypto’s Future ARK Invest’s latest $5.2 million investment in Coinbase shares is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a strategic endorsement of Coinbase and the enduring potential of the cryptocurrency market. Cathie Wood ‘s firm is clearly betting big on the future of digital assets, and their continued accumulation of Coinbase stock reflects a deep conviction in the company’s role in shaping this future. For investors, this move serves as a compelling reminder of the ongoing institutional interest in crypto and the opportunities that lie ahead in this transformative space.

According to blockchain analytics firm DWF Labs, at least eight insider wallets dumped $107 million worth of token, triggering a catastrophic market reaction. Within days, LIBRA lost $4 billion in market capitalization , wiping out the savings of nearly 75,000 investors, who collectively lost $286 million. The incident has fueled renewed calls for stronger investor protections and tighter regulations around politically promoted cryptocurrencies. The scale of the crash has led to accusations of market manipulation and insider profiteering, with critics arguing that political endorsements lend an illusion of legitimacy to otherwise risky ventures. Milei, now facing impeachment calls, has requested Argentina’s Anti-Corruption Office to investigate whether government officials had any role in the scandal. Calls for Transparency and Liquidity Safeguards Industry experts warn that unless proper liquidity safeguards and fair launch mechanisms are introduced, politically-endorsed tokens will remain highly vulnerable to manipulation. DWF Labs’ report recommends liquidity locking mechanisms, preventing major token holders from suddenly withdrawing large amounts of funds. This measure could help maintain market stability, ensuring that investors can buy and sell without triggering excessive price fluctuations. Andrei Grachev, Managing Partner at DWF Labs, highlighted another major issue: the unchecked dominance of whales and trading bots in token launches. He argues that limiting bot activity and whale participation could help create a fairer launch environment, preventing a handful of insiders from amassing control over supply. “Projects must strive for equal opportunity in token allocations,” Grachev stated. “Allowing a small number of well-funded players to corner the market leads to exactly these kinds of collapses.” A Lesson in Due Diligence The Libra scandal underscores a broader need for transparency in token launches. The lack of pre-launch wallet disclosures, combined with insiders knowing about the token’s release weeks in advance, created a perfect storm for manipulation. DWF Labs suggests that launchpads and exchanges implement stricter due diligence on new tokens to prevent similar debacles in the future. The fallout from Libra’s collapse comes just as New York lawmakers push for stricter laws against rug pulls and insider fraud, signaling that regulators are watching the space more closely. Whether this incident serves as a wake-up call for investors or just another cautionary tale remains to be seen.

This means users on Sonic can now tap into lending markets where risks are kept separate. This means if one market hits trouble, it won’t drag down the others. After passing several security audits, Silo V2 is now live and already attracted $400 million locked into the platform. Silo V1 made a big splash in the DeFi world, facilitating loans worth hundreds of millions of dollars across more than 50 markets—without any blow-ups or solvency issues. Anyone can create a lending market for any ERC-20 token and customize settings like loan-to-value ratios, liquidation thresholds, and interest rates. This means more flexibility for lenders and borrowers and permits users to fine-tune strategies to fit specific assets and market conditions. You might also like: Aave expands DeFi reach with v3 launch on Sonic mainnet Users are in control One of the biggest upgrades with V2 is that users no longer need permission to create a market, it is open to anyone. Silo has also introduced what is called “hooks,” which let users add new features like connecting different markets, redirecting idle funds to other platforms for extra yield, or setting up fixed-term loans. The use of the ERC-4626 standard also means Silo V2 will be able to communite with other DeFi apps, making it easier to move funds and interact with different platforms. Smarter risk management To keep things secure, Silo V2 now uses a dual-oracle system to separate LTV and liquidation threshold calculations—basically making risk assessment more accurate and reducing the chances of bad debt. Another unique feature is that market creators can earn fees on interest and incentives through an ERC-721 token. This creates a new revenue stream for market builders while encouraging the creation of more diverse and competitive lending options. Looking ahead After Sonic, Silo plans to roll out V2 on Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Base, expanding its reach and cementing its place in the DeFi space. With its combination of flexibility, security, and scalability, Silo V2 is poised to make decentralized lending more accessible and user-friendly than ever.

With these plans, the EV car company is aiming to regain ground lost during a price war in its second-largest market. Tesla is developing the model under a project codenamed “E41” and will build it using existing production lines. The vehicle will be in mass production at its biggest factory by output in 2026, said two of the sources. Aerial photo of Tesla’s Texas factory. Source: Tesla (X/Twitter) More details regarding the vehicle development According to the sources, the car will come in smaller sizes and cost at least 20% less to produce than the refreshed Model Y, a mid-size SUV crossover that retails from 263,500 yuan ($36,351), launched late last year. The Shanghai output will be mainly sold in China to defend market share, one of the sources has also said. The model’s production will not be restricted to America but will also include Europe and North America, though the source who revealed this did not provide a time frame. All sources shared their comments under the clause of confidentiality as the project is not public knowledge. Tesla’s plans to get its Chinese team to create a lower-cost Model Y was first reported by 36Kr. In January, Tesla revealed it was on track to deploy new, cheaper electric vehicle models in the first half of this year and would start testing a paid autonomous car service in June, news that had investors excited and overshadowed quarterly results that fell short of Wall Street expectations. When the news was revealed in January, details like the size of cost reduction, pricing, size or specification were also conveniently left out so the world has had to wait to hear more about it. The Model Y emerged as China’s best-selling car in 2023 and 2024 but has been struggling with strengthened competition from domestic peers, with at least six rival models popping up in the past year alone. All the extra competition made Tesla’s market share in China’s battery-only EV market slip to 10.4% last year from 11.7% a year earlier. Xiaomi’s YU7 crossover is looking like Tesla’s strongest rival, but it is yet to launch and is expected to do so this year, analysts have said. The SU7 sedan from Xiaomi — which up till April 2024 was mostly focused on making smartphones — has outperformed Tesla’s Model 3 with sales on a monthly basis since December. Meanwhile, Tesla in recent times, has been less focused on announcing any completely new products other than its autonomous ‘Cybercab’ robotaxi scheduled for 2026. The EV company has instead been busy fending off its growing list of rivals, particularly in China, which has seen different versions of existing models developed in quick succession. Tesla plans to launch a six-seat variant of the Model Y later this year in China, which has emerged a market of increasing importance as car sales have plunged in Europe and the U.S. Promotional photo of Tesla’s Model Y. Source: Tesla (X/Twitter) Aside from its plans to deploy a cheaper model, Tesla has also gotten the White House to publicly endorse its product through Trump, who purchased a sleek red model that cost him $78,000 some days ago. Tesla anticipates regulatory hell thanks to Trump’s tariff wars Tesla, in a letter to the U.S. Trade Representative’s Office, which is available on the office’s website, has revealed that it and other major American exporters are currently exposed to retaliatory tariffs that could be leveled in response to President Donald Trump’s aggressive use of tariffs. The comments reflect those of many U.S. businesses concerned by Trump’s tariffs, but this stands out because it comes from Tesla. The letter, which was dated Tuesday, is among hundreds sent by companies to the office about U.S. trade policy. Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk has presented himself as a close ally of Trump and has been leading the White House effort to shrink the size of the federal government as the head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). His closeness to Trump initially caused his company’s stocks to surge as investors anticipated clear skies under Trump’s regime. Unfortunately, even Musk did not see the tariff wars happening, and his company now seems to be inheriting some of the hate directed at the Trump administration, hence the declining car sales in areas like Europe. It is unclear who at Tesla wrote the letter, as it was left unsigned, but it is assumed to be from Tesla as it was on company letterhead. Tesla says it is crucial to ensure that the Trump administration does not “inadvertently harm U.S. companies” in its quest to address trade issues and enrich America. The company says it is eager to avoid retaliation of the type it faced in prior trade disputes, which led to increased tariffs on electric vehicles imported into countries subject to U.S. tariffs. “U.S. exporters are inherently exposed to disproportionate impacts when other countries respond to U.S. trade actions,” Tesla’s letter read . “For example, past trade actions by the United States have resulted in immediate reactions by the targeted countries, including increased tariffs on EVs imported into those countries.” Trump is reportedly now considering imposing significant tariffs on vehicles and parts made around the world by early April. Tesla is one of the companies that capitalized on cheap labor and resources from other countries and has warned that even with aggressive localization of the supply chain, “certain parts and components are difficult or impossible to source within the United States.” Big tent came a long way 😎 June 8, 2018 – 1st Model 3 coming out of GA4 at Fremont Factory October 25, 2024 – 1 millionth Model Y built at GA4 pic.twitter.com/8SuyuxZbtu — Tesla (@Tesla) October 26, 2024 The automaker added that companies will “benefit from a phased approach that enables them to prepare accordingly and ensure appropriate supply chain and compliance measures are taken.” “As a U.S. manufacturer and exporter, Tesla encourages USTR to consider the downstream impacts of certain proposed actions taken to address unfair trade practices,” the EV maker wrote.

Are you bracing for another dreaded bear market? Hold your horses! CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju offers a reassuring perspective, suggesting that the current slowdown in Bitcoin demand isn’t necessarily a prelude to a prolonged downturn. Let’s delve into the details and understand why this prominent crypto analyst believes it’s not time to panic just yet. Decoding Bitcoin Demand: What’s Really Happening? According to CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, recent on-chain data reveals a decrease in Bitcoin demand. He highlighted this observation on X, sparking discussions and analyses across the crypto community. But what exactly does ‘slowing Bitcoin demand’ mean in practical terms? It suggests a reduced appetite for purchasing Bitcoin at current price levels. This could manifest in various ways, such as: Decreased trading volume: Fewer Bitcoin transactions happening on exchanges. Lower inflows to exchanges: Less Bitcoin being deposited on exchanges, potentially indicating reduced selling pressure but also less buying activity. Cooling off in accumulation addresses: A slower rate of growth in addresses known for accumulating Bitcoin for long-term holding. However, it’s crucial to understand that a temporary dip in Bitcoin demand is a common occurrence in the volatile crypto market. Fluctuations are inherent, and knee-jerk reactions based on short-term data can be misleading. This is where a deeper crypto market analysis becomes essential. Bear Market Fears: Are They Justified by Slowing Demand? The million-dollar question: Does this slowing Bitcoin demand signal the dreaded arrival of a bear market? Ki Young Ju firmly believes the answer is no, at least not yet. He emphasizes that while demand has softened, it doesn’t automatically translate to a bear market scenario. Why this optimism? Here are some key points to consider: Bear markets are typically characterized by prolonged and significant price declines: A temporary demand dip is different from a sustained downtrend accompanied by widespread selling pressure and negative market sentiment. On-chain data offers a nuanced perspective: CryptoQuant’s platform provides a wealth of on-chain data beyond just demand metrics. Analyzing indicators like miner reserves, exchange flows, and investor behavior paints a more complete picture of market health. Market cycles are natural: The crypto market operates in cycles. Periods of high demand and bullish sentiment are often followed by consolidation phases or temporary corrections. A demand slowdown could simply be a natural part of this cycle, not necessarily the start of a bear market. To further illustrate this point, consider the following table comparing typical bear market characteristics with the current situation: Characteristic Typical Bear Market Current Situation (According to CryptoQuant CEO) Price Trend Sustained and significant downtrend Demand slowdown, but not necessarily a major price collapse Market Sentiment Overwhelmingly negative, fear and panic selling Cooling demand, but not widespread panic On-Chain Data Negative indicators across multiple metrics Demand dip, but other indicators might be holding up Duration Prolonged period of decline (months to years) Potentially temporary demand adjustment It’s crucial to avoid jumping to conclusions based on a single metric. A comprehensive crypto market analysis requires looking at a broader range of data points and contextualizing them within the larger market cycle. Delving Deeper into Crypto Market Analysis: Beyond Bitcoin Demand While Bitcoin demand is a significant factor, it’s just one piece of the puzzle when conducting a thorough crypto market analysis. To gain a holistic understanding, we need to consider other crucial elements: Macroeconomic factors: Global economic conditions, interest rates, inflation, and geopolitical events can significantly impact crypto markets. Regulatory landscape: Developments in crypto regulations across different jurisdictions can influence market sentiment and investor behavior. Technological advancements: Innovations in blockchain technology, adoption of crypto in various sectors, and development of new use cases contribute to the long-term growth and stability of the market. Investor sentiment: Overall market sentiment, fear and greed indices, and social media trends provide insights into the collective psychology of crypto investors. Altcoin performance: The performance of altcoins relative to Bitcoin can offer clues about broader market trends and risk appetite. Therefore, while the slowing Bitcoin demand is noteworthy, it’s essential to evaluate it within this broader context. A comprehensive crypto market analysis involves weaving together various data points and perspectives to form a well-rounded outlook. Understanding Market Sentiment: Is Fear Gripping the Crypto Space? Market sentiment plays a pivotal role in driving crypto price action. Fear and uncertainty can lead to sell-offs, while optimism and excitement can fuel rallies. So, how is the market sentiment shaping up amidst this reported slowdown in Bitcoin demand? While some level of caution is understandable given the demand dip, widespread panic doesn’t seem to be the dominant sentiment. Here’s why: Experienced investors remain composed: Many seasoned crypto investors understand market cycles and are less likely to be swayed by short-term fluctuations. Long-term bullish narrative remains intact: The fundamental arguments for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies – decentralization, scarcity, inflation hedge potential – are still compelling for many. Institutional adoption continues: Despite market volatility, institutional interest in crypto assets is steadily growing, providing a foundation for future growth. CryptoQuant CEO’s statement provides reassurance: Ki Young Ju’s analysis offers a voice of reason and data-driven perspective, helping to calm potential fears. Of course, market sentiment can shift rapidly, and it’s crucial to stay informed and monitor developments closely. However, the current market sentiment, while cautious, doesn’t appear to be overwhelmingly negative, which is a positive sign. The Power of On-Chain Data: Unveiling Bitcoin’s Health Platforms like CryptoQuant empower investors with access to invaluable on-chain data. This data, derived directly from the blockchain, provides transparent and objective insights into Bitcoin’s network activity and investor behavior. Analyzing on-chain data allows for a more informed assessment of Bitcoin’s underlying health, going beyond just price charts and trading volumes. Key on-chain metrics to monitor include: Exchange reserves: The amount of Bitcoin held on exchanges. Declining reserves can suggest reduced selling pressure. Miner reserves: The Bitcoin holdings of miners. Miner behavior can influence market supply dynamics. Stablecoin reserves on exchanges: The amount of stablecoins held on exchanges. High stablecoin reserves can indicate potential buying power waiting on the sidelines. Active addresses: The number of unique addresses participating in Bitcoin transactions. This reflects network activity and adoption. Long-term holder behavior: Analyzing the movement of coins held by long-term investors provides insights into their conviction and market outlook. By leveraging on-chain data, investors can gain a deeper understanding of market dynamics and make more informed decisions. CryptoQuant’s platform, as cited by Ki Young Ju, serves as a powerful tool for navigating the complexities of the crypto market. Navigating the Crypto Market: Actionable Insights for You So, what are the key takeaways from this analysis of slowing Bitcoin demand and CryptoQuant CEO’s perspective? Here are some actionable insights for navigating the current crypto market: Don’t panic based on short-term data: Market fluctuations are normal. Avoid impulsive decisions driven by fear. Conduct thorough research: Go beyond headlines and delve into comprehensive crypto market analysis using tools like on-chain data platforms. Diversify your portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification can mitigate risk in volatile markets. Focus on long-term fundamentals: Evaluate the long-term potential of your crypto investments based on their technology, use cases, and adoption prospects. Stay informed and adapt: The crypto market is constantly evolving. Continuously learn, adapt your strategies, and stay updated on market developments. Remember, informed decisions are empowered decisions. By understanding market dynamics, leveraging data-driven insights, and maintaining a balanced perspective, you can navigate the crypto market with greater confidence and resilience. In Conclusion: Staying Calm Amidst Market Fluctuations While a slowdown in Bitcoin demand might raise eyebrows, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju’s analysis provides a reassuring counterpoint. It highlights that a temporary dip in demand doesn’t automatically equate to a bear market. By considering a broader range of on-chain data, macroeconomic factors, and market sentiment, we can gain a more nuanced understanding of the current crypto landscape. Instead of succumbing to fear, focus on informed analysis, long-term perspectives, and strategic decision-making to thrive in the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency. The crypto market, by its very nature, is dynamic. Navigating it successfully requires knowledge, patience, and a cool head.

Bitcoin (BTC) price is below $85,000, while Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) are stuck in a bear market. The crypto fear and greed index has dropped to below 20. So, what next for BTC, ETH, and XRP prices as the tariff concerns remain ahead of FOMC decision? Crypto Market Drops as the Tariff Tantrum Continues Ahead of FOMC The financial market is usually driven by fear and greed. At times, this market is characterized by tantrums, especially when the market is fearful about key events. One of the top tantrums in the market was the taper tantrum in 2013 when the Fed started to unwind its quantitive easing program. The stock and crypto markets are now going through a tariff tantrum after Donald Trump implemented import tariffs. The fear is that these tariffs will lead to a recession , with companies like PIMCO, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan have all expressed concerns about these tariffs and raised their tariff odds. A recession would be a good thing for BTC, ETH, XRP, and other risky assets as it would push the Fed to slash interest rates. These assets normally thrive when the Fed is cutting rates. The FOMC will likely provide more information about what to expect this year in terms of interest rates. A sign that it will deliver more cuts, as the US bond yields are signaling, will be a good thing for crypto prices. BTC, ETH, XRP Analysis Amid Tariff Concerns Bitcoin and most cryptocurrencies will continue to react to the latest tariff news from the US. So, what next for BTC, ETH, and XRP prices? BTC Price Technical Analysis The daily chart shows that the BTC price formed a double-top pattern at $108,300, and has crashed below the neckline at $89,000. It has also formed a death cross as the 200-day and 50-day weighted moving averages (WMA) have flipped each other. Bitcoin price has also moved below the major S/R pivot point of the Murrey Math Lines tool. The Percentage Price Oscillator (PPO), a unique form of the MACD indicator, has moved below the zero line. Therefore, the price of Bitcoin will likely continue falling as sellers target the key support at $$73,630, the highest level in March last year. The bullish BTC price forecast will become invalid if the coin rises above the key resistance at $89,000. BTC Price Chart ETH Price Technical Analysis The ETH price has continued falling this week, accelerating a trend that started a few months ago when it formed a triple-top pattern at $4,000. It has dropped below the key support at $2,115, the neckline of this triple top. The Average Directional Index (ADX) has risen to 40, meaning the momentum is continuing. That is a sign that the Ethereum price will likely continue falling, with the next point to watch being at $1,500. A move above the resistance at $2,115 will invalidate the bearish view. ETH Price Chart XRP Price Technical Analysis The daily chart shows that the price of Ripple has bounced back a bit in the past few days. This recovery happened after it retested the important support at $1.9614, a key level since it was the neckline of the hand and shoulders pattern. XRP Price Chart As such, this is a sign that bulls are resisting it moving below the neckline, which would lead to more downside, potentially to $1 or below. A move above the right shoulder will invalidate the bearish XRP price prediction .

In a new strategy session, Svenson tells his 82,800 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin is at a critical juncture that could determine the crypto king’s price direction over the coming weeks and months. According to Svenson, Bitcoin is sitting just above a parabolic trend that started in early 2023 and the next move the flagship digital asset makes will be decisive. “…we are currently just above it [parabolic trend line]. But it’s getting a pretty close call here. Bitcoin can’t spend too much time going sideways. And it also can’t spend really any time on the weekly [time frame] going down, without breaking the parabolic trend. So this is pretty much the last leg – it’s either going to hold here and start to trend upward or it’s going to end up turning into something else. Maybe a sideways low.” Source: Kevin Svenson/ YouTube Svenson says that if Bitcoin turns lower instead of going higher, it could plunge to levels last recorded in November. “The other option is that we just break down and go into, maybe the high $60,000s. Right now, there are signs pointing to the idea that we may enter a stage where the market is in a lull, where we actually kind of just chop sideways for a while exit, this parabolic trend and go into a more of an accumulation zone.” Source: Kevin Svenson/ YouTube Bitcoin is trading at $82,900 at time of writing. The analyst says that if the bulls prevail, Bitcoin has more upside potential based on the weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI), a momentum oscillator used to determine overbought and oversold levels. “If Bitcoin plays out a bullish scenario, whether we go up sooner or accumulate for longer, and we run up to a new high a new all-time high, it’s likely that the weekly RSI would actually be at a lower high. Basically testing the overbought zone before pulling back. And it’s possible that that would be the cycle high. So I do see that Bitcoin could test the overbought levels on the weekly, which means there’s quite a lot of upside to play out before the market gets totally overheated.” Source: Kevin Svenson/ YouTube ?

41642996,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=387442,1741952945,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/41642996.jpeg,SEC Reportedly Considering Classifying XRP as a Commodity,https://cryptopotato.com/sec-reportedly-considering-classifying-xrp-as-a-commodity/,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reportedly considering classifying XRP as a commodity rather than a security. This discussion is said to have emerged amid ongoing settlement negotiations between the agency and Ripple Labs, potentially signaling a shift in its regulatory stance. SEC Weighs XRP’s Commodity Status According to insiders cited by senior Fox Business correspondent Charles Gasparino, the SEC is re-evaluating XRP’s utility and market behavior to determine if it aligns more with commodities like ETH. “One issue that is being weighed by the commission is whether $XRP continues to trade and have a utility that makes it more a commodity and not a security,” the reporter wrote. “I am told the Ethereum example is key,” he added, revealing that the regulator is comparing XRP’s trajectory with ETH. The latter was issued through an initial coin offering (ICO), but its transition into a commodity spared it from SEC action. The agency is now seeking to establish whether XRP may have evolved in a similar fashion. “The SEC believe ETH trades as pure commodity. They are trying to determine if the commission can make that case with $XRP,” claimed Gasparino. This discussion comes as part of the broader settlement talks between Ripple and the SEC. The financial watchdog previously won a partial victory against the crypto payments company, securing a $125 million fine and a permanent injunction restricting institutional XRP sales. However, sources privy to the matter claim Ripple’s legal team is pushing for more favorable settlement terms, arguing that recent regulatory shifts justify a relook of the penalties imposed against the firm. According to the lawyers, if the SEC’s new leadership intends to reset enforcement policies for crypto companies, then Ripple shouldn’t be penalized for past actions. Earlier, it had been reported that these efforts to modify the settlement terms were the main reason behind the delay in resolving the case. A Proposal for XRP’s Future Meanwhile, a suggestion by Maximilian Staudinger to designate XRP as a strategic financial asset has added another dimension to the debate. His plan , submitted to the recently established SEC crypto task force, outlines how integrating the token into the U.S. financial system could unlock $1.5 trillion in liquidity and save $7.5 billion annually in transaction costs. Staudinger recommends an accelerated implementation of XRP for government transactions, bank liquidity, and even a potential national Bitcoin reserve . Amid these developments, XRP has experienced a mixed market performance. Despite a 2.6% increase in the last 24 hours, its 13% decline in the past week means it has underperformed compared to the broader crypto market, which is down 6.40%. However, the asset’s fully diluted valuation (FDV) has now surpassed Ethereum’s. At the time of writing, it stood at $229.2 billion, compared to ETH’s $228.1 billion.

Scaramucci said he expects BTC’s price to reach $200,000 by the end of 2025. Bitcoin’s Crash Just A Buying Opportunity As Price Heads To $200K Bitcoin will reach $200,000 despite the latest market bloodbath. Since setting its current all-time high of nearly $109,000 in January, Bitcoin’s price dived to a four-month low of around $77,100 this week, tumbling sharply alongside U.S. tech stocks and other crypto assets. The huge sell-off came as the U.S. President Donald Trump’s drastic tariff plans sparked concerns among investors, further worsened by his comments that he would not rule out a recession during this “period of transition.” Anthony Scaramucci remains bullish due to the four-year Bitcoin cycle that has played out after every halving. He believes BTC is currently trading at a 20% discount to its expected value. As such, he is scooping up more coins at current prices. BTC has rebounded to $82,248 as of press time, representing a 3.1% gain on the day according to CoinGecko . The Bitcoin halving refers to a periodic event built into the protocol when the amount of Bitcoin given to crypto miners is cut in half as a reward. This is to slow down the rate at which new Bitcoins are generated, limiting inflation and extending its issuance over time. The 64th and final halving will occur sometime in 2140, after which no more Bitcoin will be created. The SkyBridge Capital founder and managing partner believes that even if Bitcoin does not reach the exact target, the $150,000-$200,000 range would still make 2025 a great success for the benchmark cryptocurrency. Despite the wild price swings in the short-term, Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory has always remained bullish. Market drawdowns shake out weak hands but “diamond hands” investors are focused on the bigger picture. Historically, the quadrennial halving events have sparked parabolic upward moves, and Scaramucci thinks this time will be no different.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-14 11:52:12

While it was announced that there will be no new BTC purchases for now, that the USA will keep the BTCs in its possession, it was stated that ways to purchase new BTCs will be investigated. As uncertainties surrounding the Bitcoin reserve continue, US congressman Byron Donalds will introduce a bill to enact an executive order signed by Trump establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve and a US digital asset stockpile. According to Bloomberg, Byron Donalds will introduce a bill today that will secure the national BTC reserve. The bill’s passage will ensure that the reserve and stockpile cannot be eliminated by executive order of subsequent presidents. The bill needs 60 votes in the Senate and a majority in the House of Representatives to become law. The executive order signed by Trump calls for the creation of a Bitcoin reserve within the Treasury Department for the approximately 200,000 Bitcoins held by the U.S. government. The executive order also authorizes the Treasury and Commerce Departments to develop budget strategies to purchase more Bitcoin for the reserve without imposing additional costs on taxpayers and prohibits the sale of any Bitcoin in the reserve. *This is not investment advice.

The losses come despite World Liberty Financial’s ongoing investment strategy, which saw it purchase an additional 541,783 SEI tokens late Thursday using $100,000 in USDC. Trump's World Liberty( @worldlibertyfi ) spent 100K $USDC to buy 541,783 $SEI again 5 hours ago. The 9 tokens purchased by World Liberty are currently in a total loss of $124M! https://t.co/xSSBxhy4Wl pic.twitter.com/lckcFLRjOB — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) March 14, 2025 The nine tokens on the platform’s portfolio are Ethereum (ETH), Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC), Tron (TRX), Chainlink (LINK), Aave (AAVE), Ethena (ENA), Movement (MOVE), Ondo Finance (ONDO), and Sei (SEI). ETH, wBTC, LINK and AAVE market slump add to WLFI losses Among the biggest losses in World Liberty Financial’s portfolio is ETH, which topped the losses charts with $93.6 million shillings. On March 6, the project significantly increased its ETH holdings, tripling its position in the crypto in a period of a week. Data from Arkham Intelligence reveals that World Liberty Financial now holds approximately $11.2 million more in ETH than it did a week earlier. ETH’s intraweek prices have dropped more than 13%, adding to WLFI’s portfolio $1.92 million losses over the same time. ETH/USDT price chart. Source: TradingView Other losses came from WBTC, AAVE, LINK, and ENA, who all wiped away over $3 million from the DeFi platform. Out of the three, it is LINK that added most to the project’s woes, which is down almost 18% from its value of $17.6 on March 7. Last week, WLFI added $10 million worth of Wrapped Bitcoin and $1.5 million in Movement Network (MOVE) tokens to its treasury. These acquisitions took its overall portfolio deeper in the red, with MOVE shedding over 10.5% of its price in the last seven days, now changing hands at $0.47. In early February, WLFI transferred its entire crypto treasury to Coinbase Prime, describing the movement as part of its treasury management strategy, to cover operational expenses, fees, and working capital requirements. “To be clear, we are not selling tokens, we are simply reallocating assets for ordinary business purposes,” WLFI stated on its official X account to dispel accusations that it was dumping tokens. WLFI’s token sale raises $590 million In other more positive news, World Liberty Financial’s has reportedly closed its token sale, securing approximately $590 million in funding. According to data compiled by ICODrops , the figure places WLFI’s token sale among the top 10 largest in history, though it remains far from the record $4.21 billion raised by EOS. WLFI co-founder Zak Folkman has publicly credited Tron’s Justin Sun for the project’s fundraising success. Speaking at Consensus 2025 in Hong Kong , Folkman said that Sun’s investment and presence in the project’s plans helped move the market’s positive sentiment around WLFI, which initially had little support because of the platform’s affiliation with the Trump family. “When we were launching this project, it was a very heated time,” Folkman said during the Consensus panel discussion. “There was a lot of scrutiny on our project due to who was involved.” He explained that several traditional crypto venture capital firms shied away from investing in WLFI, cautious about its political associations. Still, Justin Sun boldly made investments worth $30 million into the project in November 2024 before increasing his commitment this year. “Sun saw that regardless of the outcome, this project is a monumental move forward for the entire crypto community,” Folkman added. As of the latest data on WLFI’s website, only 34.6 million tokens remain from the 5 billion that was added to the public sale on January 20. It has now sold 24.97 billion WLFI tokens out of the 25 billion allocated, which accounts for 25% of the total token supply.

Every investor dreams of discovering that hidden gem before the market catches on. I’ve personally seen early buyers turn modest investments into huge profits overnight. Right now, Dawgz AI is one of those rare opportunities: it’s still in presale, and new investors are joining daily, hoping to catch the next wave. But Dawgz AI isn't alone - two other promising projects are also gaining serious attention. Stick around as I highlight three crypto projects set to dominate the industry and why getting in early could be the smartest decision you make. Next Big Crypto Curious about the next big crypto everyone's buzzing about? Let's dive into three standout projects that might soon shake up the crypto landscape and potentially redefine the entire industry. 1. Dawgz AI Dawgz AI is way beyond the typical meme coin hype - this coin offers real value. While many meme tokens bank purely on memes to attract investors, Dawgz AI steps up the game by integrating powerful AI-driven bots to boost your crypto holdings. These bots actively trade, steadily growing your investment over time. Even better, if you buy in using ETH, you can stake your coins and earn passive income with impressive APY returns. The presale has quickly attracted attention, already securing over $2.6 million and rapidly approaching $2.63 million. With only 8.888 billion tokens available, this Ethereum-based crypto coin promises security, stability, and serious growth. Key Features: AI-driven trading bots active 24/7 ETH staking with strong passive APY Presale raised over $2.6M (nearing $2.63M) Limited token supply: 8.888 billion $DAWGZ Ethereum-based blockchain technology for reliability 2. Degen Degen is another meme coin making its presence felt in the crypto market, showing a current price of around $0.003119. With a healthy market cap sitting above $44 million and solid daily trading volumes around $17.75 million, it's clearly popular among traders. Built on a stable blockchain, Degen offers a fully diluted valuation of $115.31 million, indicating potential for future growth. While it doesn't yet match Dawgz AI's impressive presale momentum, its circulating supply of roughly 14.17 billion tokens and total supply of 36.96 billion DEGEN tokens suggest there's still room for expansion. Key Features: Current Price: $0.003119 Market Cap: Over $44M Trading Volume: Around $17.75M daily Total Supply: 36.96 billion DEGEN tokens Blockchain technology: Ethereum-based (ERC-20) Meme-driven community appeal 3. Osaka Protocol Osaka Protocol (OSAK) is another crypto trying to carve out a spot, though it's had a challenging run lately, currently trading at around $0.00004948. The current 24-hour trading volume for Osaka Protocol (OSAK) is approximately $109,716. The coin has experienced declining momentum, with a market cap of about $37.7 million and a substantial circulating supply of over 761 billion tokens. However, recent price movements indicate a downward trend, suggesting less investor enthusiasm compared to newer meme coin projects like Dawgz AI. While Osaka Protocol might still attract interest due to its relatively low market cap, it lacks the strong growth indicators seen in Dawgz AI's presale. Key Features: Current Price: $0.00004948 Trading Volume: approximately $109,716 Market Cap: $37.78 million Circulating Supply: 761.4 billion OSAK tokens Recent downward price trend suggests cautious outlook What’s the Next Big Crypto When investors ask, ""What's the next big crypto?"" they're usually looking for huge potential gains - something fresh, innovative, and capable of shaking up the crypto world. Dawgz AI fits that description perfectly. While other projects like Osaka Protocol and Degen have made waves, neither matches the rapid growth Dawgz AI is currently experiencing. Its presale is already booming, drawing thousands of new investors daily who see serious profit potential. I've personally seen presale coins similar to Dawgz AI skyrocket once they hit exchanges, rewarding those who jump in early. If you're hunting for the next crypto superstar, Dawgz AI looks like your best bet. Dawgz AI vs Degen vs Osaka Protocol: Which Meme Coin Wins? If you're exploring meme coins, you've probably come across Dawgz AI, Degen, and Osaka Protocol - but which one truly deserves your attention?Let's compare these three contenders head-to-head and see which meme coin offers the best shot at real returns. Feature Dawgz AI Degen Osaka Protocol Current Price Presale Stage $0.003119 $0.0000494 Market Cap Presale (over $2.6M raised) ~$44 million ~$37.7 million Trading Volume Presale phase (high demand) ~$17.75 million/day ~$109,716/day Price Trend Rapidly Rising Stable/moderate Declining Token Supply 8.888 billion DAGZ 36.96 billion DEGEN 761.4 billion OSAK Blockchain Technology Ethereum-based Ethereum (ERC-20) Ethereum-based Passive Income (Staking) High APY rewards None specified None specified AI-Powered Trading Bots Yes, 24/7 automated No No Investor Sentiment Rapidly increasing interest Stable Declining Future Growth Potential High Moderate Limited/Cautious Conclusion If you're hunting for the Next Big Crypto, Dawgz AI ticks all the boxes. Unlike other meme coins I've invested in. Dawgz AI isn’t just hype - it’s actually backed by powerful AI technology that can make your money work for you. I've personally watched friends make serious returns by catching these coins in presale, and Dawgz AI has already pulled in over $2.6M, showing investors clearly see big potential. Trust me - early moves in presales often pay off big, and Dawgz AI looks perfectly positioned to become crypto’s next breakout star. Don't miss your chance to get in early. FAQ What is the next big crypto to invest in? The next big crypto worth your attention is Dawgz AI. With an active community, advanced tech, and powerful presale momentum, it's drawing interest from seasoned investors and early adopters who recognize potential for explosive growth early on. Which crypto has 1000X potential? If you're seeking a crypto investment with true 1000X potential, Dawgz AI stands out. Getting involved in its presale phase can deliver exponential returns, especially when compared to traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Which crypto will reach $10,000? Reaching $10,000 is challenging even for established coins like Bitcoin. Rather than chasing unrealistic goals, many investors see Dawgz AI's presale as the best bet for significant growth, thanks to its realistic roadmap and genuine long term utility. Which meme coin will give 1000X? The meme coin most likely to achieve 1000X returns is clearly Dawgz AI. It combines community backing with advanced AI tools, key indicators seasoned investors trust, and it's still in the early stages, making explosive gains possible.

Regulatory delays put XRP back in the spotlight, while Pi Network surges and Remittix gains traction with real-world payment solutions. Table of Contents SEC extends XRP ETF decision Pi Network sees spike ahead of Pi day A promising XRP rival with PayFi potential What lies ahead for traders and projects Regulatory delays have brought the focus back onto XRP after the United States Securities and Exchange Commission took their time with the review process for proposed exchange-traded funds centered around the token. Meanwhile, the recent Pi Network pump caught the industry by surprise as it illustrates how fast the mood can change because of community achievements and rumors of giant exchange listings. Yet against the backdrop of high-profile names awaiting approval or seeking sudden price spikes, some investors are turning to an emerging payments-based alternative that quietly tackles real-world needs without the same regulatory hurdles. SEC extends XRP ETF decision Currently priced at around $2.2, reports on XRP explain that the SEC decision affects filings from both Grayscale and Canary, with their proposals for launching XRP-based ETFs. The products were amended late last month, with the initial 45-day review period ending in early April. By stretching the time frame, the regulators are giving themselves additional time to evaluate the risks in the markets as well as compliance matters. A few XRP enthusiasts were expecting a positive ruling sooner, especially given the push for altcoin ETFs that promise new institutional inflows. Nevertheless, the commission’s persistence is still a reality. Although a final green light may drive prices for XRP someday, the current holdup is a setback meaning traders will have to keep looking toward spot markets. Some other altcoins and new token issues may capture interest instead. Source: Tradingview Pi Network sees spike ahead of Pi day Pi Network recovered well. Pi rose 20%, trading around $1.60, far short of its all-time high near $2.98. The recovery consolidated support around $1.30–$1.40, likely supported by anticipation around the “Pi Day,” a critical event when users are expected to transfer mined coins into the mainnet. Based on experts , the Pi ecosystem’s momentum also stems from speculation about a possible Binance listing. Over 87% of the users participating in a poll last month were favorable towards the Pi coin getting enlisted with the exchange. Binance has remained silent about such plans and the listing is not certain. The technical outlook sees Pi moving beyond the 21-day EMA with the immediate resistances around the level of $1.75–$2.00. With the volume remaining robust, the cryptocurrency might attempt a stronger break. Source: Tradingview You might also like: Cardano, XRP investors seeking higher gains turn to viral altcoins like Remittix A promising XRP rival with PayFi potential As the wait for XRP’s ETF goes on, another token is making waves by addressing real-world payment issues. Remittix (RTX), which is trading at $0.0734, had more than $13.8 million in presale and sold more than 518 million tokens. It is focused on quick crypto-to-fiat conversions, which are preferred by freelancers and businesses alike due to the ease of cross-border transactions. Suppose there’s a Southeast Asian artisan retailer selling goods to overseas consumers. Traditionally, the proprietors would face high fees and unpredictable exchange rates when converting different crypto payouts into the local currency. Remittix’s PayFi platform is able to cut through such barriers, facilitating near-immediate settlement with assured fees. Maintaining the end-user priority has also proved attractive for many who are tired of speculative markets. With the priority continuing to be tangible remittance solutions, Remittix stands the chance for steady long-term expansion. Analysts say that as larger coins like XRP deal with delays and Pi captures short bursts of hype, practical tokens can carve a sustained market share. Remittix’s presale accomplishments point to real enthusiasm for PayFi technology, suggesting that tangible utility often speaks louder than news cycles. What lies ahead for traders and projects The SEC’s ongoing caution around XRP ETFs highlights the broader regulatory uncertainty that looms over many top crypto assets. Meanwhile, Pi Network’s rally demonstrates how community events and listing rumors can spark quick price moves, though lasting impact depends on execution. In contrast, a PayFi-focused token like RTX can build momentum on solving everyday hurdles, sidestepping the pitfalls that come with purely hype-based rallies. While traders wait for an XRP ETF decision, some see Pi’s mainnet migration as a pivotal test of user confidence. Others place their bets on a rising payment solution that offers stable settlement features. Each path presents its own risks and rewards: the regulatory route for XRP might open doors to institutional capital, whereas Pi’s short-run gains hinge on exchange listings. Tokens addressing real-world challenges like Remittix, however, might achieve more growth even if hype subsides.

On the other hand, if the market is hit again by external forces like regulations or negative statements by influencers. Hence, the meme coin might trade at a potential low of $ 0.62 . We expect the DOGE price to reach a new swing high of $1.07 by the end of 2025. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $0.62 $0.84 $1.07 Can DOGE Break the $1 Barrier? Given DOGE’s success, largely driven by hype with some technical progress, crossing $1 by 2025 remains a realistic possibility. A sustained media frenzy and growing endorsement deals could maintain bullish momentum. Expanded merchant adoption would also strengthen confidence in its long-term viability. Dogecoin’s Tokenomics and Long-Term Outlook The future of Dogecoin hinges on its utility. Meme popularity alone may not sustain it indefinitely, but advancements in transaction fees, speed, and business collaborations could help it thrive as a mainstream digital currency. Its large and passionate community will likely continue to drive positive evolution. Conclusion Given Dogecoin’s past price behavior, driven largely by online hype and media coverage, it has the potential to reach over $1 in 2025. DOGE has shown remarkable resilience, and key factors like expanded merchant adoption, community growth, and protocol upgrades could enhance its viability.

According to a recent Bloomberg report , Donalds’ bill aims to protect the executive order to establish a national strategic Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve and U.S. digital asset stockpile from being eliminated by executive policies or decisions of future American presidents. Therefore, the bill serves to “codify” the executive order signed on March 7. “For years, the Democrats waged war on crypto. Now is the time for Congressional Republicans to decisively end this war,” said the Florida Republican. Donalds himself has been known to embrace crypto as he prepares to run for Florida governor in the upcoming election. In order to pass, the bill would require 60 votes from the Senate and a majority vote in the House of Representatives. Trump’s administration has been deemed much more pro-crypto, especially compared to the previous Biden administration, which has been accused of trying to snuff out the crypto industry through regulatory bodies like the Securities and Exchange Commission . So far, the majority of crypto-friendly policies have gained support in Trump’s Congress from both Democrats and Republicans.

Trump’s executive order mandates the creation of a Bitcoin reserve as well as a digital asset stockpile of major tokens like XRP ( XRP ), SOL ( SOL ) and ADA ( ADA ). The reserve would be compiled using BTC held by the U.S. federal government, seized from criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings. Not only that, the executive order also authorizes Treasury and Commerce Departments to come up with “budget-neutral strategies” for buying more Bitcoin for the reserve. That way, the government would not buy Bitcoin using taxpayers’ funds. The executive order also prohibits the sale of any Bitcoin in the reserve. AI and crypto czar David Sacks estimated that the U.S. government currently holds 200,000 BTC. However, the exact amount has not been disclosed, considering the BTC trove has never been subject to a full audit.

The S&P 500 has dropped 10% since February, and the Nasdaq 100 is down 13%, but Hartnett believes this will force policy intervention before things get worse. He is watching for the S&P 500 to hit 5,300 points, another 4% decline, before calling a bottom. “We say this is a correction, not a bear market in US stocks,” Hartnett wrote . “Since equity bear threatens recession, fresh declines in stock prices will provoke flip in trade and monetary policy.” He wants to see stock outflows accelerate, fund managers holding over 4% cash, and high-yield spreads hitting 400 basis points before he moves in. Until then, he’s keeping an eye on how far the market dips. BofA considers Trump’s trade war threats and market reactions The sell-off started when Donald Trump’s tariff policies raised fears of a global trade war. Investors are worried his economic decisions could push the U.S. into a recession. Inflation is cooling, but Wall Street is watching the Federal Reserve to see if it steps in. Right now, swaps traders aren’t expecting a rate cut until June, but the next Fed meeting could change that. Treasury yields are moving. At 6 a.m. ET on Friday, the 10-year Treasury yield rose 2 basis points to 4.299%, while the 2-year Treasury yield climbed to 3.973%. One basis point is 0.01%, and bond prices move opposite to yields. Investors are waiting for the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index, which will give an outlook on economic confidence and personal finances. Inflation data is mixed. The Producer Price Index (PPI) was flat for February after jumping 0.6% in January. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.2% month-over-month and 2.8% annually, softer than expected. This should have eased some concerns, but Trump’s latest comments on tariffs have kept markets on edge. “I’m not going to bend at all,” Trump said during an Oval Office meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. “We’ve been ripped off for years, and we’re not going to be ripped off anymore.” He’s also threatening a 200% tariff on EU alcoholic products in response to Europe lifting its suspension on American whiskey tariffs. This could push up liquor prices and hit U.S. businesses exporting to the EU. Dow Theory signals deeper market trouble A century-old stock market indicator is flashing a warning. Dow Theory says that when transport stocks and industrial stocks fall together, it signals a deeper market downturn. Right now, the Dow Jones Transportation Average has dropped 19% since November, close to bear market levels, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 9.3% from its December peak. “As a risk barometer check, that’s not a great backdrop for the overall market,” said Todd Sohn, managing director at Strategas Securities. The sell-off is hitting homebuilders, chipmakers, and industrial stocks, showing widespread weakness. Big companies are cutting forecasts. Delta Air Lines slashed its profit outlook in half, and American Airlines expects a first-quarter loss twice as big as its previous estimate. Retailers Dick’s Sporting Goods and Kohl’s reported weak sales expectations, signaling that consumers are pulling back on spending. “The animal spirits created after the presidential election appear to have given way to increased pessimism about the impact tariffs could have on inflation and economic activity in the US,” said Lee Klaskow, senior analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. He warned that a slowing economy hurts freight demand and could drag markets lower. Some analysts say the Dow Theory is outdated because the economy today is driven more by tech and services than manufacturing. But the fact that transport stocks are on track for their worst weekly decline since September 2022 is enough to make investors nervous. Technical analysts are seeing sell signals. Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial, said that the Dow Jones Transportation Average has fallen below its 2024 lows, a critical level for market technicians. He also pointed out that the Dow Jones Industrial Average has broken its January pullback lows, confirming that the overall trend is down. “To make matters worse, its Dow Theory cousin — the Dow Jones Industrial Average — has also rolled over and violated the pullback lows from January, checking the box for a sell signal as the averages confirm the primary trend of the market is no longer higher,” Turnquist said.

Bitcoin's recent 30% drop offers a potential buying opportunity, with key support levels between $69K and $83K. My analysis of Bitcoin's price structure suggests a possible final wave up to $125K before a bear market. A break below $69K would put my bullish outlook in question, signaling the bear market's possible early arrival; trade cautiously and watch support levels closely. I used my last article to warn you about a coming bear market in Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). I took up my keyboard because the crypto market’s sentiment regarding the Trump presidency was reaching new levels of silliness. In essence, many talking heads in the space used Trump’s positive stance on crypto to suggest that the bull cycle was just beginning. Yet Bitcoin has already made a 400% run in price over two years. I don’t mean to be unappreciative regarding Trump’s pro-Bitcoin stance. He has abolished an enforcement regime against the industry that was not based in the rule of law. More particularly frustrating to me was the wanton unbanking of companies in the space, making it hard to do business with companies that I have worked with for years. That unbanking threat has also been extended to me by certain banks when they found out I was in the industry. Crypto climbed in 2022–2023 under a decidedly anti-crypto administration. I suppose the reasoning goes that if Bitcoin printed a 400% return during the Biden administration, surely it will accelerate once Trump is in office. Is that a reasonable expectation? My 25 years in trading markets have taught me that who is in the White House matters little to investment returns. This should much more be the case with Bitcoin returns, an asset purported to be a state-resistant form of money. Further, as stated in my last article, the best news often occurs at tops. I was partially correct in my article. January 20, 2025, the date of Trump’s inauguration, marked the 2025 top, so far. Bitcoin fell 30% from January 20th to the low on March 11th, the morning of the day I am writing this article. I was only partially correct because I wrote that I expected the bear market to start after Bitcoin reaches $125K. So, here I am today to say I still hold to that target, until my key support breaks, which I will share below. That means that this 30% drop provides an opportunity, perhaps the last in 2025. Let’s dive into how price structure looks today. An Unfinished Fifth In my last article, I left you with a chart that showed a fifth wave that was in progress off of Bitcoin’s low in the $50Ks made in August 2024. And in that fifth, the third (circle-iii) had topped and circle-iv was in progress. Four days after the article was posted, Bitcoin formed its 2025 top at ~$109,300. Those with only a basic understanding of the Elliott Wave Theory may perceive that that was a top in circle-v and that the entire bullish cycle missed my target of $125K. That is possible. Sometimes, fifth waves are weak. However, most fifth waves, particularly in Bitcoin, measure at least 61.8% in log of the preceding third. That would have placed the top in the $138K region. It would take a sustained break below $69K to suggest to me that I should consider Bitcoin posted a week fifth. Instead, I find it more probable that that top formed as a B wave in an ongoing circle-iv. B waves in flat corrections that break over the previous high are very common in Bitcoin. Bitcoin 6H Chart (Motivewave software) As you can see in my chart, we are getting very close to a more complete circle-iv in this region. Fibonacci-based support for this fourth is $72K. Fibonacci support levels are less reliable in a diagonal, which is the structure I ascribe to the fifth wave out of $50K. However, $69K marks the bottom of the B wave of circle-iii. Rarely, the fourths in diagonals in Bitcoin break that level. Technically, the fourth isn’t invalid until it breaks the second wave at $52,500, a level I called out in my last article. Bitcoin 12H chart (Motivewave software) In short, I consider the zone where Bitcoin sits as of writing, between $69K and $83K, as the opportunity zone. Ideally, we will see one more low near $75K. However, as of writing, if Bitcoin forms five waves to $88K, I will assume the bottom is in. Trading the Zone In my articles, I discuss how I use price regions determined as support to scale into my trades. If the price is at the higher end of a support region, I keep my position light until a more convincing reversal forms. As price drops deeper into support and closer to my stop, I can size up with lower risk. I will stop out upon a sustained break below $69K. I press the gas once I see five waves out of support and see the first pullback off that five-wave structure. That is because the risk level tightens up with that reversal, making pressing the accelerator panel less risky. To remind you, I shared in January that my overall exposure to the crypto sector is reduced. But this last great opportunity in 2025 is compelling enough to size up again briefly. Conclusion In closing, I remind you that a crypto bear market is coming. Despite fresh positive winds in the political scene toward the industry, the bull market we enjoyed for over two years is coming to a close, ideally when Bitcoin reaches $125K. That said, the correction in Bitcoin that started late last year should provide the basis for a low-risk trade from here to that bull market top. Those who take this trade should keep an eye on $69K, which, if breached, warns that the bear market came sooner rather than later.",BTC-USD,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-03-14 12:00:00

After a rigorous auditing process, the protocol has left the beta phase and is now expanding its isolated lending markets, with over $400 million already locked into Silo V2. Looking ahead, Silo has announced future deployments on Arbitrum ( ARB ), Base (BASE), and other Ethereum ( ETH ) Virtual Machine (EVM) Layer-2 ( L2 ) and EVM-compatible chains. Silo V2 markets Building upon the foundations laid down by Silo V1, which facilitated hundreds of millions in loans across more than 50 isolated pools on ETH and various L2s, Silo V2 introduces customizable twin-asset lending markets . These markets allow deployers to optimize their solutions for a more diverse range of assets by tweaking parameters such as loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, liquidation thresholds, oracles, and interest rate models. Other key features of Silo V2 are permissionless market deployment and optional hooks that enable inter-market connectivity, yield optimization through idle liquidity deployment on other decentralized apps (dApps), and the creation of fixed-term or permissioned regulated asset markets. Silo V2 security Third-party integration on Silo V2 is ensured by the protocol’s adherence to ERC-4626 standards. A dual-oracle system further improves risk management by calculating LTV and liquidation thresholds to mitigate bad debt. The protocol also offers modular liquidation and interest rate options to accommodate traditional, auction-based, and fixed-rate structures and assets ranging from stablecoins to real-world assets (RWAs). Finally, deployer revenue, an optional fee on interest and incentives that accrues as an ERC-721 token, rewards market creators for the development of customized markets. As such, Silo V2 helps deployers achieve their goals by ensuring that issues in one pool don’t affect the entire ecosystem, while Sonic’s emphasis on speed and developer-friendly tools serves to further enhance its use cases.

Can the AAVE token strengthen its position? When will the coin be able to bounce back and surpass its previous all-time high? Let’s dive into our detailed Aave price prediction to find out. Table of Contents What is Aave? Aave crypto price prediction: general outlook Aave price prediction 2025 Aave price prediction 2030 What is Aave? Aave is a decentralized lending platform that primarily operates on the Ethereum blockchain. It focuses on providing interest, loans, and credit services through a decentralized network to ensure proper functionality. The platform manages multiple smart contracts within its network, with various codes that execute actions specified by the user in their request. Aave requires users to provide collateral worth at least the value of the borrowed assets. The cryptocurrency is then provided as Aave ( AAVE ) tokens (aTokens), which are pegged to the value of the borrowed asset. Users have the flexibility to repay their loan in a different cryptocurrency than the one borrowed, as long as the digital currency is supported by the platform and the value is equivalent to the borrowed asset.

Aave crypto price prediction: general outlook According to crypto.news, AAVE saw a 27% surge, reaching an intraday high of $220 on March 5. However, the coin started to decline after that, falling about 20% over the past week and trading at $166 on March 14. AAVE 1-day chart, March 2025 | Source: crypto.news A large part of last week’s price increase happened after Marc Zeller, the founder of Aave Chan Initiative, asked the community to support a proposal to rethink how Aave allocates its revenue and manages liquidity. This has energized investors looking for improvements on the platform. In addition, AAVE’s recent integration with Sonic, a high-speed EVM blockchain formerly known as Fantom, played a big role in its boost. The partnership helped Sonic’s total value locked (TVL) surge to $33 million in just one day, further expanding Aave’s network with new platforms like Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum, and Polygon. Here’s a closer look at the Aave price prediction for 2025 and the years that follow. Aave price prediction 2025 According to CoinCodex’s short-term Aave price forecast, the token might face a decline in the near future, potentially dropping to $165.16 by April 9, 2025. As of March 11, 2025, the Aave price prediction remains mostly bearish, with 24 technical indicators pointing to a downward trend, while only 8 suggest a potential upside. For the long term, CoinCodex predicts that AAVE could trade between $105.64 and $228.30 throughout 2025. On the other hand, DigitalCoinPrice is more optimistic, forecasting that AAVE could surpass its all-time high, with prices ranging from $393.29 to $401.62 by the end of the year. Wallet Investor also sees a positive outlook, with AAVE potentially reaching $383.70 by late 2025. Will Aave go up or down in five years? Let’s take a look at the Aave coin price prediction for 2030. You might also like: Aave launches EURC stablecoin on Base to be used as collateral for lending and borrowing Aave price prediction 2030 CoinCodex forecasts that by 2030, AAVE could trade anywhere between $49.11 and $187.37. On the other hand, DigitalCoinPrice has a much more optimistic AAVE price prediction, suggesting that the token could soar to somewhere between $869.07 and $1003.47 by the end of the decade. WalletInvestor’s expectations indicate a more significant leap in value, estimating the token could reach a maximum price of $1757.68. Should you invest in Aave? With all the different projections out there, AAVE shows a lot of promise for long-term growth, especially with some positive forecasts predicting a great price jump by 2030. That said, there are still short-term ups and downs, and market sentiment isn’t entirely clear right now. If you’re comfortable with some risk and are looking for potential long-term gains, AAVE could be worth considering. Just be sure to do your own research and think about how much risk you’re willing to take on. Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

The altcoin market cap could already have bottomed. Will Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and Thorchain (RUNE) be among the first to reverse the downtrend? Total2 bounce could be the start of the altcoin trend reversal Source: TradingView Total2 tracks the combined market cap of all the cryptocurrencies, excluding $BTC. In this chart it can be seen that the price went down to touch the 0.786 Fibonacci level, which is the deepest of these levels. A bounce has ensued, and it remains for the altcoin bulls to push the price up above the current strong resistance level in order to complete the next stage towards reversing the downtrend. $XRP approaches breakout TradingView With the proviso that everything is still very much dependent on what Bitcoin does, $XRP is at breakout, or yet another rejection. The very strong support at $1.96 has been holding firm, and the latest rally bounced from this level. Now up against a descending trendline, which started from the all-time high set in mid-January, a breakout is a first step towards a trend reversal. A couple of fake-outs have already occurred so it will be critical for the $XRP bulls to make a new local high above $3. Still on the table is a rejection from here, but one that puts in a higher low. $SOL breaking out, but into strong resistance Source: TradingView The 4-hour chart for $SOL shows that a breakout is taking place. That said, a strong resistance level awaits overhead. Even if the breakout is successful, there may be some choppy sideways price action before the bulls are able to punch through this resistance. The support level at $112 is also a strong one, probably marking an absolute bottom, so it looks likely that the price will continue to rise from here. $RUNE breaks out - up 10% Source: TradingView $RUNE is among the leading gainers so far on Friday. Up more than 10% on the day so far, this surge has enabled the price to break out of the descending trendline. The price is currently at resistance, if this can be overcome, the next targets, according to the Fibonacci levels for this move, are at $1.25, $1.32, $1.40, and $1.52. A reversal of this local downtrend would take place only if the bulls can make a higher high above $1.66. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

In 2017 Chinese entrepreneur Justin Sun founded the non-profit organization TRON Foundation in Singapore. He conducted one of the largest ICOs in history, raising 15 000 bitcoins, and then issued 100 billion TRX ERC-20 tokens. Why ERC-20? Initially, TRX was a token on the Ethereum blockchain. However, in 2018, TRON fully transitioned to its own blockchain, and TRX became a native cryptocurrency. The ERC-20 TRX tokens were destroyed after being exchanged by their holders for the TRON network’s native token.What will the Tron crypto price prediction be for the near future and beyond? Is Tron a good investment? Tron coin price prediction: general outlook In early December 2024, the price of TRX reached a new all-time high of $0.4407 per coin, and TRON entered the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The surge in TRX’s price was sparked by several posts from Justin Sun, where he made bold claims — first saying that TRX is equivalent to XRP, and then claiming that TRX has outdone the US dollar. After this strong surge, the price of the coin gradually started to decline. As of March 13, 2025, it had lost nearly 50% of its all-time high reached three months ago, trading at around $0.225 with a market cap of over $21.35 billion, according to crypto.news .

Fast forward to 2025 and people are speculating on whether NFTs can ever reclaim their past glory. There was truly a time when a digital image of a monkey (Bored Apes collection) fetched thousands of dollars in ETH, however, now they are just out of the crypto scene. Read this article to find out what are NFTs, why they became so popular, and how to make them yourself! Ever since it went mainstream in 2021, everyone from digital artists to celebrities to football clubs has hopped on the NFT train. Read on to learn all about NFTs and why they’re so popular! Table of Contents What are NFTs? How do NFTs work? What are NFTs used for? Important platforms in the NFT space How To Create An NFT? Ways To Promote Your NFT Are NFTs dead? FAQs What are NFTs? NFTs stand for “Non-Fungible Tokens”. If an object is fungible, it’s easily traded with another item of the same value. For example, fiat currency is fungible because you can trade a $20 bill with another $20 bill, which will still have the same value. In contrast, you cannot easily exchange non-fungible items. For example, while the Mona Lisa and Starry Night are both paintings, they don’t have the same value and cannot be traded. NFTs are pieces of data attached to a digital asset (e.g., pictures, music, or videos) that act as proof of ownership of that asset. While the asset can be copied and saved by others, you’re the rightful owner of that digital asset. Most NFTs are one-of-a-kind items – the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) generative NFT collection is a good example. The collection consists of 10,000 ape pictures, and none of them are exactly the same. The fact that there’s only one copy of each ape in existence is what makes them valuable. While NFTs have been around since 2014, they truly exploded in 2021, thanks to big pushes from celebrities and sports figures. Endorsements from celebrities like Grimes and Matt Damon, as well as the success of NBA Top Shot, propelled NFTs into the mainstream. Since then, more and more people have flocked to NFTs (even making their own) to capitalize on the boom. You might also like: NFT sales surge 19.6% to $152.9m, Doodles dethrones Pudgy Penguins How do NFTs work? NFTs exist on a blockchain, a public digital ledger that records transactions. While most NFTs are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain, some are hosted on alternative blockchains like Solana and Polygon. Creating an NFT is called minting. It involves attaching a digital certificate to the piece of art and registering it on the blockchain. The digital certificate confirms your ownership of the art and records the NFT’s transaction history. If you buy an NFT from someone else, you can see all of its previous owners in the digital certificate. Similar to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, you “store” NFTs in a digital wallet. Unlike physical wallets that hold money, digital wallets provide access to the NFTs recorded on the blockchain. What are NFTs used for? NFTs are primarily used to signify ownership of digital assets and prevent fraud. But thanks to developments in the field, there are many other ways to use NFTs, like: Certificates of ownership One of the basic uses of NFTs is to verify your ownership of a digital asset. Say you have a CryptoPunks #124 NFT. While anybody on the Internet can save the picture, you’re the rightful owner because you have the digital certificate of ownership. Digital collectibles Some NFTs are designed as digital collectibles, similar to how people collect stamps or baseball cards. Stores like NBA Top Shot and Topps NFTs bring sports collectibles into the 21st century with digital collectibles you can trade with other collectors. Investment vehicles The scarcity of NFTs makes them great mediums for investment and speculation. Many collectors “flip” NFTs by buying them at a low price early on, then selling them for a higher value immediately after. Other collectors prefer to hold onto NFTs in hopes they’ll multiply in value in the future. Real estate documents NFTs are essentially digital records secured on a blockchain, meaning they’re almost impossible to tamper with. The real estate industry can use NFTs as digital land deeds to speed up transactions and track property value changes. Video game items NFT-based gaming is taking the industry by storm. Players collect unique, one-of-a-kind in-game items they can use to power up their characters. Meanwhile, games like Axie Infinity implement a play-to-earn model, where players breed creatures to battle and trade with for real-world money. Important platforms in the NFT space The NFT space is more than just digital artwork and marketplaces. With more industries and players coming in, the NFT space is ever-expanding. Here are some common platforms you’ll find in the NFT space: NFT marketplaces Some of the best NFT marketplaces like OpenSea, Rarible, and Coinbase NFT are like the hubs of the NFT landscape. They host digital collectibles made by a wide range of creators and put them up for sale to the public. Many of these marketplaces also host NFT drops, where new NFT projects are launched. Long-established players in the fine art world like Sotheby’s and Christie’s have also entered the NFT space. Notably, Christie’s hosted the auction where Beeple sold his Everydays: The First 5000 Days NFT for a whopping $69 million in 2021. NFT launchpads Launching an NFT project alone can be challenging for some people – this is where NFT launchpads come in. These companies help artists by providing fundraising and marketing for their NFT collections. Metaverse The easiest way to describe the metaverse is like the virtual world seen in Ready Player One. While we haven’t quite reached that level yet, virtual worlds like Decentraland let players create, mingle, and play in customizable LANDs. How To Create An NFT? Creating NFTs in crypto is a relatively simple process. All you need is your favorite creative software, artistic talent, and crypto in your wallet. Here’s how to make an NFT in six easy steps: Come up with an idea. Depending on your objectives, you can create a piece that appeals to a wide audience or art that only a small niche would appreciate. Work on the art piece. Use your creative software to bring your idea to life. Consider generative art scripts if you’re planning to make large NFT collections like BAYC. Save your work. Ensure you have backups so you won’t have to start over if something happens. Sign up for a cryptocurrency exchange and connect your crypto wallet to the site. Choose the “Mint” option and go through the entire process. Pay the gas fee, and your NFT is officially minted. Ways To Promote Your NFT Now that your NFT is uploaded to the marketplace, you must promote it so people want to buy it. Some of the best NFTs also have the best marketing teams behind them. Here are some of the best marketing methods to promote your NFT: Create dedicated NFT collection social media accounts to post artwork and project updates. Start a Discord community to foster an active fanbase and gain early buyers. Work with NFT influencers to promote your collection. Are NFTs dead? It is true that NFTs experienced explosive growth in 2021, but the hype has truly faded in 2025, where only a handful of crypto bros talk about them. Back then the true meaning of NFTs was more of a status symbol than just trading it on the NFT marketplaces. Digital art collections like Bored Ape Yacht Club, and others were publicly shared on live TV and promises were made of their long-term viability. But referring to NFTs as “dead” would be premature. By 2025, NFTs encompass more than simply digital art and collectibles. The emphasis has switched to real-world uses, with sectors including virtual real estate, gaming, and intellectual property adopting NFTs to generate value outside of the speculative frenzy. With the development of blockchain technology, NFTs are becoming instruments for digital ownership, asset tokenization, and even decentralized identity verification. 2025 decline of NFTs The dominance of CryptoPunks has diminished as newer initiatives have surfaced and pushed the limits of what NFTs may represent, even though they are still largely recognized as the original digital collectible and retain major cultural importance. The next stage of NFTs is now being defined by projects like CloneX, Azuki, and Pudgy Penguins , which go beyond the speculative art scene and include community-driven experiences, metaverse integration, and real-world application. In order to ensure sustained involvement, Pudgy Penguins, for instance, has had success growing its brand through tangible goods and experiences for holders. Creating a community-driven environment with cross-platform connectivity has helped Azuki gain traction, while RTFKT Studios’ CloneX has solidified its position in the digital and physical worlds by using partnerships with well-known companies. Although the original excitement surrounding NFTs has subsided, the fundamental technology is still thriving. NFTs are increasingly regarded as essential elements of a larger, more sustainable digital economy; it’s no longer simply about the fast flip or speculative value. These projects now concentrate on creating distinctive digital experiences, fostering real-world relationships, and enhancing communities in order to bring value. You might also like: NFT sales suffer, Pudgy Penguins plunge: Here’s the latest FAQs How do I buy NFTs? You can buy NFTs by going to NFT exchanges like OpenSea, Rarible, and SuperRare. Register an account, browse the selection, and buy NFT pieces that catch your eye. What content can be made into NFTs? Any type of digital content can be made into NFTs, including images, music, videos, or even funny tweets. However, you need to legally own the content before turning it into an NFT. Where can you mint NFTs? You can mint NFTs on NFT trading platforms by uploading your art and paying gas fees.",Learn|Altcoin|Blockchain|NFT,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|TECHNOLOGY|AXS|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-03-14 12:09:24

The legislation will require at least 60 votes in the U.S. Senate and a majority support in the House of Representatives. Under the Trump administration, the support for crypto assets and blockchain technology has achieved bi-partisan approval. Consequently, the bill by Representative Donalds will likely pass with a unanimous majority. “For years, the Democrats waged war on crypto. Now is the time for Congressional Republicans to decisively end this war,” Donalds noted . Future Importance of the Bill on the Strategic Crypto Reserve The political view on digital assets has undeniably divided the Democrats and the Republicans in the recent past. As a result, the bill introduced by Representative Donalds will ensure the strategic Bitcoin reserve and the crypto stockpile will not be eliminated via executive action by future presidents. Furthermore, the Trump administration intends to add more Bitcoins to the roughly 200k seized from criminal activity via budget-neutral strategies. Notably, Trump’s EO authorizes the Treasury Department to develop a strategy to purchase more BTCs and does not weigh on the burdened taxpayers. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto News: Trump Administration Set to Focus on U.S.-Based Altcoins, Expert Reveals Bullish Outlook , For instance, some financial experts have noted that the U.S. government could issue a Bitcoin-backed bond to buy more BTCs.
