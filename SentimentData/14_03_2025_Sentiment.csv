In a move that has sent ripples through the tech industry, OpenAI is advocating for the U.S. government to consider banning AI models originating from the People’s Republic of China (PRC), specifically naming DeepSeek, a prominent Chinese AI lab. This isn’t just about competition; it’s a serious escalation of concerns around data security, intellectual property, and the very nature of AI development in different geopolitical spheres. For those in the cryptocurrency space, where decentralization and security are paramount, this development raises crucial questions about the future of AI and its potential impact on our digital world. Why is OpenAI Targeting DeepSeek and China AI Models? OpenAI’s proposal, submitted as part of the Trump Administration’s ‘AI Action Plan’ initiative, paints a concerning picture of DeepSeek. They label DeepSeek as ‘state-subsidized’ and ‘state-controlled,’ alleging that this connection poses significant risks. But what are the core arguments behind this dramatic call for bans on China AI ? Data Security Concerns: OpenAI argues that DeepSeek, like other PRC-supported operations, is legally obligated to comply with Chinese government demands for user data. This raises red flags about privacy, especially when these models are used globally. Intellectual Property (IP) Theft Risks: The proposal explicitly mentions the ‘risk of IP theft’ as a consequence of using ‘PRC-produced’ AI models . This suggests OpenAI’s worries extend beyond just data privacy to encompass broader economic and technological espionage concerns. Tier 1 Export Rule Countries: OpenAI recommends extending these bans to all ‘Tier 1’ countries under the Biden Administration’s export rules. This broad stroke aims to create a firewall against potential security vulnerabilities and IP risks across nations considered strategically important. It’s important to note that OpenAI’s accusations are not entirely new. They have previously accused DeepSeek of ‘distilling’ knowledge from OpenAI’s own AI models , violating their terms of service. However, this latest proposal marks a significant escalation, directly challenging the integrity and security implications of DeepSeek’s operations due to its alleged ties to the Chinese state. DeepSeek’s ‘Reasoning’ Model R1 Under Scrutiny One of the specific targets mentioned in OpenAI’s proposal is DeepSeek’s R1 ‘reasoning’ model. OpenAI claims this model, along with others from DeepSeek, is inherently insecure due to the perceived state control. But is this concern justified? Let’s break down what we know: Aspect OpenAI’s Claim Context & Nuance State Control DeepSeek is ‘state-controlled’ and influenced by the PRC government. While DeepSeek’s founder met with Xi Jinping, direct evidence of state control is not explicitly provided. DeepSeek originated as a spin-off from a quantitative hedge fund. Data Access Chinese law compels DeepSeek to provide user data to the government. This is a valid legal concern for any company operating under Chinese jurisdiction. However, the extent and nature of data access in practice remain debated. Model Security DeepSeek’s models are inherently insecure due to potential backdoors or data siphoning. DeepSeek’s open models are hosted on platforms like Microsoft, Amazon, and Perplexity, suggesting they lack built-in mechanisms for direct government data extraction. The ambiguity in OpenAI’s proposal regarding ‘models’ is also noteworthy. Are they referring to DeepSeek’s API, their open-source models, or both? This distinction is crucial because open-source models, by their very nature, are more transparent and less susceptible to hidden backdoors. The fact that major tech companies are hosting DeepSeek’s open AI models suggests a level of scrutiny and trust within the tech community, even amidst these allegations. What are the Broader Implications of Banning ‘PRC-Produced’ AI Models? If the U.S. government were to act on OpenAI’s proposal and implement bans on ‘PRC-produced’ AI models , the ramifications would be far-reaching. Consider these potential impacts: Escalating Tech Cold War: Such bans could further fuel the ongoing tech rivalry between the U.S. and China, potentially leading to a more fragmented global AI ecosystem. Innovation Slowdown?: Restricting access to certain AI models and technologies could hinder innovation, particularly in areas where cross-border collaboration is beneficial. Market Disruption: Businesses and developers relying on ‘PRC-produced’ AI models would need to find alternatives, potentially incurring costs and delays. Setting a Precedent: This move could set a precedent for other nations to impose similar restrictions based on geopolitical considerations, further segmenting the global tech landscape. AI Policy and the Crypto World: A Convergence? For the cryptocurrency community, this OpenAI proposal and the broader debate around AI policy are deeply relevant. Here’s why: Decentralization vs. Centralized Control: The core ethos of crypto often revolves around decentralization and resisting centralized control. OpenAI’s concerns about ‘state-controlled’ AI resonate with these values, highlighting the potential dangers of concentrated power in emerging technologies. Data Privacy and Security: Data privacy and security are paramount in both the crypto and AI domains. The allegations against DeepSeek underscore the importance of robust security measures and transparent data handling practices in AI development, mirroring the crypto community’s focus on these principles. Geopolitical Influence on Tech: The OpenAI proposal demonstrates how geopolitical tensions can directly impact the tech industry, potentially shaping regulations and access to technologies. This is a crucial consideration for the crypto space, which is also navigating evolving regulatory landscapes across different nations. Navigating the Complexities of Global AI Development OpenAI’s call for bans on DeepSeek and other ‘PRC-produced’ AI models is a stark reminder of the complex interplay between technology, security, and geopolitics in the age of artificial intelligence. While concerns about data security and intellectual property are valid and warrant serious consideration, the path forward requires careful deliberation. Unilateral bans could have unintended consequences, potentially stifling innovation and exacerbating international tensions. As the AI landscape continues to evolve at breakneck speed, open dialogue, international cooperation, and a balanced approach to security and innovation are crucial. The cryptocurrency community, with its inherent focus on decentralization and security, has a valuable perspective to contribute to this ongoing conversation.

41615523,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=692637,1741908581,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/41615523.jpeg,Federal judge instructs Trump administration to reinstate fired workers in 6 federal agencies,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/judge-orders-trump-reinstate-fired-workers/,"A federal judge in California has ordered six federal agencies to promptly reinstate thousands of probationary employees fired last month. U.S. District Judge William Alsup said on Thursday that these employees from the departments of Agriculture, Energy, Interior, Treasury, Defense, and Veterans Affairs should be given their positions back immediately, describing their terminations as “sham” proceedings that evaded legal requirements. The ruling directly affects those let go last month who had served less than one year in their positions—or less than two years for those categorized under “excepted service”—but exempts individuals considered “mission critical” at their respective agencies. These workers were informed of their dismissals through a performance-related email, according to the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), which filed the lawsuit on behalf of tens of thousands of affected staff. Although Judge Alsup limited his ruling to six agencies, he left open the possibility of broadening his order in the future to encompass more of the government. Judge Alsup said the administration labeled certain good employees as poor performers Alsup, who was nominated to the bench by former President Bill Clinton, declined to dispute the government’s general authority to lay off employees. Instead, he ruled that the process undertaken by the administration did not adhere to the law. During remarks delivered from the bench, Alsup singled out the administration for labeling certain employees as poor performers when official records showed that they had met or exceeded expectations. “It’s a sad day when the federal government would fire a good employee and say it’s based on performance when they know good and well that’s a lie,” he said. “That should not be done in our country. It was a sham to avoid statutory requirements.” Trump defends his decision to cut the Education Department workforce while in a meeting with the Prime Minister of Ireland on Wednesday. Source: Associated Press The mass firings drew on data from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), which indicated that more than 200,000 federal employees, about 10 percent of the civilian workforce, had held their positions for one year or less at the time of the terminations. This figure can also encompass recently promoted workers, as promotion resets an employee’s probationary clock. AFGE and other challengers allege that rather than following established protocols such as thorough reviews or extended probationary periods, agencies executed an across-the-board termination directive. Justice Department attorneys contend that each agency’s leadership acted within its rights, saying the administration was authorized to remove employees for performance reasons. However, Alsup criticized the government’s behavior throughout the case. He said that he isn’t questioning the government’s authority. However, the firings must done via the proper legal process. White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt blasted the court’s decision, calling it “an absurd and unconstitutional order” and insisting that “a single judge is attempting to unconstitutionally seize the power of hiring and firing from the Executive Branch.” Leavitt added that “the President has the authority to exercise the power of the entire executive branch—singular district court judges cannot abuse the power of the entire judiciary to thwart the President’s agenda.” D.O.G.E’s aggressive staff reduction turned various agencies into legal battlegrounds This clash follows months of staff reduction measures led by the Trump administration, accompanied by cost-cutting plans championed by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Analysts project that DOGE’s directives will either directly or indirectly eliminate around 500,000 federal positions in the coming years. In addition to dismissing probationary workers, the administration is offering a voluntary resignation program and has instructed agencies to craft “reduction in force” proposals, aiming to downsize departments even more. Supporters of these cuts argue that the federal government has grown too large and needs to be streamlined to manage tax dollars more responsibly. Critics assert that abrupt mass firings, coupled with the absence of orderly procedures, could cause chaos in departmental operations and violate workers’ rights. The cutbacks have also turned various agencies into battlegrounds, with legal disputes popping up across the country. One of the newest challenges came on Thursday from a coalition of 20 states, led by Democratic attorneys general, who have sued the administration over plans to slash the staff of the Education Department by nearly half. Attorneys general from Arizona, California, Colorado, New York, Wisconsin, and other states filed the lawsuit in Massachusetts, contending that the proposed downsizing is unconstitutional and would cripple key services for students nationwide. “Firing half of the Department of Education’s workforce will hurt students throughout New York and the nation, especially low-income students and those with disabilities who rely on federal funding,” said New York Attorney General Letitia James. “This outrageous effort to leave students behind and deprive them of a quality education is reckless and illegal.” Education Department spokeswoman Madi Biedermann countered that the Trump administration is acting according to the authority granted by voters. “President Trump was elected with a mandate from the American public to return education authority to the states,” she said. The workforce reduction plan, which includes around 1,950 staff reductions—1,315 of whom are federal workers—is, in the administration’s view, valid under the law and consistent with existing guidelines. Biedermann added that employees working on student-loan servicing, federal student aid, and discretionary grants remain on duty, and civil-rights investigations are continuing. The Education Department employs about 4,500 staff, making it the smallest cabinet-level agency. Nonetheless, the White House is expected to press forward with an executive order aimed at dismantling the department entirely. According to earlier reports by Cryptopolitan , Trump is urging Education Secretary Linda McMahon to coordinate the agency’s closure, despite the fact that no president can unilaterally eliminate a cabinet-level department that Congress has established. Congress must approve any measure to shut down the agency. Skeptics see this effort as part of a broader conservative agenda that has long questioned the federal government’s role in local education decisions. Under the Biden administration, conservatives criticized the Education Department for moves such as loan forgiveness programs and anti-discrimination measures for transgender students. Now, Trump appears eager to fulfill his campaign pledge of scrapping the department altogether. Polls indicate that most Americans oppose eliminating the Department of Education, citing concerns about weakening national education standards and sabotaging students who rely on federal programs. Critics warn that taking an ax to the Education workforce without proper planning could produce ripple effects in districts across the country, especially where local or state support systems are already overstretched.

Per an official release from the Irkutsk Oblast Prosecutor’s Office , officers confiscated 96 mining rigs from a facility in the village of Kazachye, in the Bokhansky District of Irkutsk. Illegal crypto mining appears to be on the rise in Irkutsk , Russia’s first and biggest Bitcoin mining hotspot. Illegal Crypto Mining – Thriving in Siberia? The prosecution service explained that an unnamed Siberian non-profit organization operated the “farm,” and installed the rigs in the orphanage.

However, it is still registered as an educational facility. An Irkutsk-based court ordered bailiffs to disconnect the mining equipment and “stop the misuse of the land.” Prosecutors said the farm operators endangered human life by “violating electricity and fire safety laws.” Officers said the operators “did not carry out preventive maintenance” for the “electrical equipment and wiring” they used. They also failed to install fire alarms and other safety devices, the prosecutor’s office added.

A local landmark in the Bokhansky District of Irkutsk, Russia. (Source: Nipiks & Co [CC BY-SA 4.0]) Is Russia’s Mining Ban Having an Effect? Crypto mining is illegal in many parts of Irkutsk Oblast – including the Bokhansky District – during the winter months. But it remains a draw to both illegal miners and above-board industrial players because of its low electricity rates. The region’s famously cold winters also mean that miners have to spend less on cooling fees. But this has led to massive drains on the power grid in both Irkutsk and neighboring areas. This, in turn, has led the Oblast’s governor to call for a year-round ban on crypto mining in much of Irkutsk until 2031 . However, these is little evidence to suggest that bans are having a deterrent effect on illegal crypto mining in Irkutsk or elsewhere in Russia. Leading Russian media outlets have reported that illegal mining farm operators are installing equipment in apartments, private plots of land, gardening associations, and inside commercial buildings. Energy experts have warned that many of these locations were “not built to cope with such heavy electrical loads.” As a Russia-Ukraine peace deal comes into focus, some investors are eager to do business in Russia again.

Analysts are calling the bottom for the dog-themed coin amid chatter for an ETF approval by the SEC. Dogecoin Price Eyes Fresh Rally As Bottom Is Spotted On-chain analysts say Dogecoin (DOGE) is poised for a massive upward price movement on the back of several positive technicals. According to pseudonymous Trader Tardigrade, Dogecoin is sticking to a macro channel that is indicative of the bottom for the memecoin. The analyst disclosed that while Dogecoin has deviated at the channel’s edge, recent price action predicted movement in the channel. With the bottom confirmed, the analyst says the only direction for Dogecoin price is a surge upwards. “If DOGE remains within the channel without deviation this time, it has already reached the bottom,” said Trader Tardigrade. Onchain analyst Ali Martinez shared sentiments similar to Trader Tardigrade’s projection, which predicted a strong resurgence. Already early signs of a resurgence are clear with Dogecoin rebounding from a key support level as traders eye $3. “Something big could be brewing for Dogecoin,” said Martinez. “A strong rebound may be right around the corner.” A Plethora Of Bullishness For DOGE A raft of experts are pointing to a breakout target of $0.6533 as confirmation of a 318% upswing for Dogecoin price. Analysts are pointing to higher lows on Dogecoin’s charts with Elliot Wave Theory indicating that prices are in a bullish wave. Outside of technicals, on-chain data confirms a 270% surge in active addresses, pointing to increasing ecosystem activity. Experts say rising whale accumulation in the ecosystem is a potential pointer for an impending Dogecoin price rally. For fundamentals, an approval for a Dogecoin ETF by the SEC could send prices soaring by triple-digit percentages. At the moment, the memecoin is trading at $0.1647 while daily trading volumes sit at a decent $1.44 billion.

The tokens were then transferred back to the main address of the World Liberty Foundation (WLF). The Trump family’s relationship with cryptocurrencies marks a significant shift from Donald Trump’s previous stance, which he called Bitcoin a “fraud” as recently as 2021. But he embraced digital assets during his second presidential campaign, vowing to make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the planet” at a Bitcoin conference in Nashville in July 2024. Trump’s proposed policies include reducing regulatory restrictions and advocating government hoarding of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Related News: As the Market Plummets, Giant Altcoin Whales Get Active - Here Are Their Latest Trades Following the Nashville conference, Trump and his sons founded World Liberty, a company that positions itself as a major name in the digital asset space. Despite initially lackluster sales, World Liberty saw a significant increase in token sales following Trump’s presidential election victory. According to data from Dune Analytics, the company has now sold $300 million worth of proprietary tokens.

41615786,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=139989,1741909232,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Update: Flipster Exchange Fortifies Crypto Data Security After Misuse Incident,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/flipster-exchange-data-security/,"In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, trust and security are paramount. Recent news surrounding the Flipster exchange has brought user data protection into sharp focus. Let’s delve into how Flipster is proactively addressing a data misuse incident and reinforcing its commitment to secure crypto trading. Understanding the Flipster Exchange Data Misuse Incident Flipster, a prominent cryptocurrency exchange, recently addressed concerns regarding a data misuse incident. It’s crucial to clarify what happened and what it means for users. According to Flipster’s official communication on Telegram, there was no security breach compromising the exchange’s systems. Instead, the incident involved a former customer support employee who, after leaving the company in January, misused retained customer data. This distinction is important: a misuse of data by an individual is different from a systemic security vulnerability. Key Takeaways from Flipster’s Announcement: No Security Breach: Flipster explicitly stated that their systems were not breached, alleviating concerns about widespread vulnerability. Former Employee Misconduct: The issue stems from the actions of a single former employee, limiting the scope of the incident. Legal Action Underway: Flipster is taking decisive action by pursuing legal measures against the individual involved, demonstrating their commitment to accountability. Financial Stability Reaffirmed: The exchange has reiterated its strong financial position, assuring users of its operational stability amidst the situation. Data Security Commitment: Flipster emphasized its dedication to data security and compliance, highlighting ongoing efforts to protect user information. Strengthening Crypto Data Security: Flipster’s Response In the wake of the data misuse incident, Flipster is taking proactive steps to enhance its crypto data security measures. This is not just about damage control; it’s about reinforcing user trust and setting a higher standard for security within the cryptocurrency exchange industry. What specific actions are they taking? Enhanced Security Measures: Internal Safeguard Review: Flipster is thoroughly reviewing and strengthening its internal safeguards to prevent similar incidents in the future. This likely includes stricter access controls and monitoring of employee activities. Data Protection Protocols: The exchange is likely reinforcing its data protection protocols to minimize the risk of data misuse, even by internal actors. This might involve enhanced data encryption, anonymization techniques, and stricter data retention policies. Compliance Reinforcement: Flipster’s reaffirmation of compliance with labor laws and data protection regulations underscores their commitment to operating within legal and ethical boundaries. Transparency Commitment: By openly addressing the incident and communicating with users via Telegram, Flipster is demonstrating a commitment to transparency, which is crucial for building and maintaining user trust. Why User Data Protection is Crucial for Cryptocurrency Exchanges This incident highlights the critical importance of user data protection in the cryptocurrency space. Exchanges handle sensitive personal and financial information, making them prime targets for both external attacks and internal misuse. For users, knowing their data is secure is non-negotiable. Why is this so vital? The Pillars of User Data Protection in Crypto: Trust and Confidence: Users entrust exchanges with their funds and personal data. Robust data protection builds trust and confidence in the platform. Regulatory Compliance: Increasingly stringent regulations worldwide mandate strong data protection measures for financial institutions, including crypto exchanges. Compliance is not just about avoiding penalties; it’s about responsible operation. Reputation Management: Data breaches and misuse incidents can severely damage an exchange’s reputation, leading to user attrition and loss of business. Proactive data protection is essential for safeguarding reputation. Preventing Financial Loss: Compromised user data can lead to financial losses for users through identity theft, phishing attacks, and account takeovers. Strong data protection mitigates these risks. Ethical Responsibility: Beyond legal and business considerations, there’s an ethical imperative to protect user data. Exchanges have a responsibility to safeguard the information entrusted to them. Navigating Cryptocurrency Security: Actionable Insights for Users While exchanges like Flipster are responsible for implementing robust security measures, users also play a crucial role in safeguarding their cryptocurrency security . What steps can you take to protect yourself in the crypto world? User-Centric Security Best Practices: Strong Passwords: Use strong, unique passwords for your exchange accounts and email addresses. Consider using a password manager. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Enable 2FA on all your exchange accounts. This adds an extra layer of security beyond just a password. Be Phishing Aware: Be cautious of phishing emails and websites that attempt to steal your login credentials. Always verify the website address and sender of emails. Limit Information Sharing: Be mindful of the personal information you share online and with exchanges. Only provide necessary details. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with security news and best practices in the cryptocurrency space. Follow reputable sources and exchange announcements. The Broader Landscape of Cryptocurrency Exchange Security Flipster’s situation is a reminder of the ongoing challenges and evolving landscape of cryptocurrency exchange security . As the crypto industry matures, security remains a top priority for exchanges, regulators, and users alike. What are the key trends and challenges in this area? Evolving Trends in Crypto Exchange Security: Increased Regulatory Scrutiny: Regulators worldwide are paying closer attention to crypto exchange security and data protection, leading to stricter compliance requirements. Advanced Security Technologies: Exchanges are adopting advanced security technologies like multi-party computation (MPC), zero-knowledge proofs, and hardware security modules (HSMs) to enhance security. Cybersecurity Insurance: More exchanges are seeking cybersecurity insurance to protect against potential losses from breaches and attacks. Community and Industry Collaboration: Information sharing and collaboration within the crypto community are becoming increasingly important for identifying and mitigating security threats. Focus on User Education: Exchanges are recognizing the need to educate users about security best practices to empower them to protect themselves. In conclusion, Flipster’s proactive response to the data misuse incident and its commitment to strengthening security measures demonstrate a positive step towards fostering trust and transparency in the cryptocurrency exchange ecosystem. For users, this situation underscores the importance of both choosing secure platforms and practicing personal security hygiene. As the crypto space continues to evolve, a collective focus on security will be paramount for its sustained growth and adoption.

41616243,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=139993,1741909845,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,BREAKING: US Senate Advances Controversial Stablecoin Bill Despite Democratic Resistance,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-senate-stablecoin-regulation/,"The world of cryptocurrency regulation is heating up, and this time, the spotlight is on stablecoins! Are we finally seeing some movement on Capitol Hill? Buckle up, crypto enthusiasts, because the U.S. Senate Banking Committee just took a significant step forward in shaping the future of digital currencies in America. Despite facing strong headwinds from some Democratic members, a bill aimed at regulating stablecoins has advanced. Let’s dive into what this means for the crypto landscape and what hurdles it still needs to clear. What’s the Buzz About the Stablecoin Bill? Dubbed the GENIUS Act, this stablecoin bill is designed to establish a regulatory framework for issuers of stablecoins. Think of stablecoins as cryptocurrencies pegged to a stable asset, like the U.S. dollar, aiming to provide price stability in the often volatile crypto market. The Senate Banking Committee, in a decisive 18-6 vote, gave the green light to this legislation, signaling a potential shift in how the U.S. approaches crypto regulation . Here’s a quick rundown of what’s been happening: Committee Approval: The GENIUS Act successfully passed the Senate Banking Committee with a significant majority. Democratic Amendments Rejected: Attempts by some Democrats to introduce stricter regulatory measures were voted down. Opposition from Senator Warren: Senator Elizabeth Warren voiced strong concerns, framing the bill as a potential national security risk. Next Steps: The bill now moves to the full Senate for consideration and awaits a counterpart vote in the House of Representatives. Democratic Pushback: Why the Resistance? While the bipartisan vote suggests momentum, it wasn’t without friction. Several Democrats on the committee pushed for amendments to strengthen the regulatory oversight of stablecoin issuers. These amendments, however, did not gain enough traction to be included in the approved version of the bill. This highlights a fundamental tension in the ongoing debate around crypto regulation : balancing innovation with consumer protection and financial stability. Senator Elizabeth Warren emerged as a vocal critic, raising alarms about national security implications. Her concerns stem from reports linking former President Donald Trump to a stablecoin project. Warren argued that this connection, among other factors, makes the bill a risky proposition, potentially opening doors to illicit financial activities. Her opposition underscores the deep-seated skepticism some lawmakers hold regarding the crypto industry and its potential risks. GENIUS Act: Decoding the Stablecoin Bill So, what exactly does the GENIUS Act propose? While the full text requires a detailed legal analysis, we can break down some of the likely key components based on general discussions around stablecoin bill frameworks: Aspect Likely Provisions in GENIUS Act Issuer Requirements Likely to establish criteria for entities that can issue stablecoins, potentially including licensing or registration requirements. Reserve Requirements May mandate that stablecoin issuers hold reserves of high-quality liquid assets to back the value of their stablecoins, ensuring 1:1 peg. Regulatory Oversight Specifies which regulatory agencies (e.g., SEC, CFTC, Federal Reserve) will have jurisdiction over stablecoin issuers and their activities. Consumer Protection Could include measures to protect stablecoin holders, such as disclosure requirements, redemption rights, and safeguards against fraud and manipulation. It’s crucial to remember that this is just one step in a long legislative process. The specifics of the GENIUS Act will become clearer as it progresses through the Senate and potentially the House. However, the committee’s approval signifies a growing consensus on the need to bring stablecoins under a regulatory umbrella. Why is Stablecoin Regulation Important? You might be wondering, why all the fuss about crypto regulation , specifically for stablecoins? Here’s why it matters: Financial Stability: Unregulated stablecoins could pose risks to the broader financial system if they become widely adopted and experience instability. A run on a major stablecoin, for example, could have ripple effects. Consumer Protection: Without proper oversight, consumers holding stablecoins are vulnerable to risks like loss of funds due to issuer insolvency, fraud, or lack of transparency about reserves. Combating Illicit Finance: Like other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins can be used for illicit activities. Regulation aims to mitigate these risks and ensure compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) standards. Innovation and Growth: Clear and well-designed regulations can actually foster innovation by providing clarity and legitimacy to the stablecoin market, encouraging responsible development and adoption. What Happens Next for the US Senate and the Stablecoin Bill? With the Senate Banking Committee’s approval, the GENIUS Act now moves to the full Senate for a vote. Its journey doesn’t end there. To become law, it also needs to pass a vote in the House of Representatives and be signed by the President. Given the ongoing debates and differing viewpoints on crypto regulation , the path ahead could still be bumpy. Key things to watch for in the coming weeks and months: Full Senate Vote: The timing and outcome of the vote in the full Senate will be critical indicators of the bill’s momentum. House Counterpart: Whether a similar or compatible bill emerges in the House will be crucial for bipartisan support and eventual passage. Industry Reaction: The cryptocurrency industry’s response and lobbying efforts will likely play a significant role in shaping the final legislation. Potential Amendments: Further amendments could be introduced in both the Senate and the House, potentially altering the bill’s scope and provisions. The Road Ahead for Crypto Regulation The advancement of the stablecoin bill in the Senate is a landmark moment. It suggests that despite internal disagreements and external pressures, there’s a growing recognition in Washington D.C. that the crypto space needs a regulatory framework. While the GENIUS Act focuses on stablecoins, it could pave the way for broader crypto regulation in the U.S., influencing how other digital assets are treated in the future. For crypto enthusiasts, investors, and businesses, staying informed about these developments is paramount. The regulatory landscape is evolving rapidly, and understanding these changes will be crucial for navigating the future of digital finance. The debate around stablecoins is far from over, but the Senate’s action signals a significant step towards bringing clarity and structure to this exciting and disruptive technology.

LTC Price Drops 15% & HBAR Surges 24%,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdags-170k-holders-ready-for-keynote-3s-big-reveal-ltc-price-drops-15-hbar-surges-24/,"The crypto market has been anything but quiet—prices are swinging, traders are watching, and the drama never stops. There has been an almost 15% Litecoin (LTC) price drop, dampening excitement that had built around ETF discussions. Meanwhile, Hedera’s (HBAR) price surge took the opposite route, shooting up 24%, keeping analysts on the look out for further gains. Meanwhile, the BlockDAG (BDAG) community is stacking wins. Having raised over $202.5 million and a community of over 170,000, BlockDAG is growing fast. Early backers have seen an impressive 2,380% ROI and with the upcoming Keynote 3 around the corner, speculation is running wild—some are already calling BDAG a top crypto pick for 2025. The Litecoin Price Drops Almost 15% The recent Litecoin (LTC) price dropped 15% in the last week. There was a brief period of optimism tied to possible ETF discussions but Litecoin’s price drop reflects shifting trader sentiment. Hopes for a new investment vehicle failed to sustain LTC’s short-lived uptick. Some traditional investors remain interested in LTC, yet the market doesn’t seem as inclined. The Litecoin price drop also comes as conversations about exchange-traded funds generate mixed outlooks for various cryptocurrencies. Though many believe Litecoin still has room to rebound, it may require more than ETF-related speculation to maintain stability–traders watch to see if LTC will drop further. The Hedera Price Surge Gets Traders Talking Observers have been discussing the recent Hedera price surge that sent HBAR climbing by around 24% over the last 7 days. Some traders interpret this Hedera price surge as an indicator of shifting conditions, particularly since the token recovered from a previous dip under key moving averages. Support at the 200-day mark offered a foundation, leading HBAR to push beyond the 50-day threshold. Analysts suggest a continued Hedera price surge might attract participants who see promising indicators in the current chart signals. The next key resistance for HBAR is $0.2429, and if broken, analysts predict a 40% to 50% additional rise. Many now look to see if this Hedera price surge will continue strengthening the token’s position. All Eyes On BlockDAG As Keynote 3 Launch Nears! The anticipation surrounding BlockDAG’s Keynote 3 has reached an all-time high, with traders eagerly tracking the presale’s momentum. The project’s strong track record has fueled enthusiasm, as past keynotes have triggered significant surges. The presale has shattered the 200 million milestone—raising more than $202.5 million from selling over 18.7B BDAG coins, with the current price at $0.0248 in batch 27— a massive jump from its initial $0.001 valuation. Early adopters have already seen returns of 2,380%, while the community continues expanding, surpassing 170K+ unique holders. As BlockDAG continues to break records with its presale numbers, all attention is turning to Keynote 3. Speculation is running wild, with many believing this keynote will be unlike anything the crypto space has seen. Rumors hint at a Hollywood-level production, with a big Hollywood creator behind the keynote—heightening curiosity about the scale and impact of the event. Crypto thrives on viral moments, and this spectacle could be the catalyst for the next major price surge. As the presale rapidly becomes a top crypto to buy in 2025 , expectations for Keynote 3 are soaring. The project’s funding total is steadily climbing toward the $600 million milestone, reinforcing the growing confidence in its future. The only question left is what’s coming next—new features? High-profile partnerships? Another major price explosion? Those looking to capitalize are moving fast, locking in their positions before the next big announcement. What Comes After These Market Shifts? Crypto never sits still. The 15% Litecoin (LTC) price drop has cooled ETF hype, while the 24% Hedera (HBAR) price surge has traders watching for the next breakout. But through all the market swings, BlockDAG has been on a steady climb, gaining serious traction. Its presale has smashed records—over $202.5 million raised, 18.7 billion BDAG coins sold, and early backers sitting on a massive 2,380% ROI.

In a new YouTube video, Benjamin Cowen tells his 886,000 subscribers that there probably needs to be a change in monetary policy in order for ETH’s chart against Bitcoin ( BTC ) to bottom. “But in order to have a change in monetary policy, you have to have pain. Welcome to the pain. This is the pain that you ultimately need. Remember last cycle [in 2019], ETH/Bitcoin bottomed after ETH/USD broke support.” Cowen notes that ETH fell below its support level against the US dollar in 2019 right before the Federal Reserve ended quantitative tightening. The analyst says that everything that happened in the previous cycle is “basically happening this cycle, it’s just taking place on a longer timeframe.” Cowen also notes that most of the price points of the current cycle are roughly 10x what they were in the 2019 market. “The reason why people are having a hard time navigating this cycle and why it feels so different is because monetary policy never changed this cycle. In the last cycle, we saw a change in monetary policy in the pre-halving year. We’re now in the post-halving year and we still haven’t seen a change to the quantitative tightening. We’ve seen them taper it a little bit. They’ve slowed it down, but they’ve never actually stopped it.” ETH is trading at $1,907 at time of writing. The second-ranked crypto asset by market cap is down more than 1% in the past 24 hours.

The markets are highly uncertain, partly because Trump has delayed tariffs, only to extend the pain for traditional traders. China and Canada have introduced their own tariffs, disrupting the global supply chain. Scott Bessent, Treasury Secretary, described this in-between period as a detox period, during which markets are still trying to adapt to the new spending cuts. Trump has declined to comment on a possible recession and has even hinted that financial pain will be necessary before things improve. For this reason, Bitcoin has found support despite some drops in price, as traders are seeking a safe haven in uncertain times. Meanwhile, supply chain distributions, with no clear end in sight, have only made Bitcoin a more attractive investment. The cryptocurrency market has experienced large pullbacks, but analysts have mostly seen these dips as buy-in opportunities rather than a bear market. According to the CPI, inflation is expected to fall from 3.0% to 2.9% in February. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy, is expected to drop from 3.3% to 3.2%. The trade war between Canada and America has calmed down slightly. Traders remain concerned about an economic slowdown, which could pressure treasury yields and push Bitcoin into another bull market. Using one-year inflation, the New York Fed survey projected an upswing of 3.0% to 3.1%. Traders, however, are seeing a possible rate cut in June, providing more support for Bitcoin. However, if interest rates remain high, the Fed may need to maintain higher interest rates. Bitcoin does not earn interest, so investors may be less inclined to buy cryptocurrency. Trump’s trade tariffs on aluminium and steel imports will go into effect on Wednesday. Job openings have already started to rise in February, anticipating the tariffs. “We expect core CPI inflation”, wrote TD Securities analyst, “to cool down in February following the January jump to 0.45%, as price resets came in firmer than expected in the services segment”. “We look for slowing in both the goods and services segments, with owners’ equivalent rent (OER) inflation dropping to a 3-month low. On a year-over-year (YoY) basis, headline and core CPI inflation are likely to drop by a tenth each to 2.9% and 3.2%, respectively”. Egg prices were a key driver of inflation, rising 53% in January from the year before. Conversely, average grocery prices rose 1.9% over the same period. Other products, such as tomatoes and bread, dropped in price, buffering the inflated price of eggs. Brooke Rollins, the Department of Agriculture Secretary, said that, due to Trump’s five-point plan to tackle bird flu, egg prices dropped to $1.85 per dozen, down from $5 in January. Further drops in inflation may provide a reason for a rate cut, providing much-needed relief from what is called the cost-of-living crisis. This would ease up personal budgets so that people can buy more Bitcoin in preparation for uncertain times.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|REGULATION|ASIA,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-14 00:01:15
41616600,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=140012,1741910493,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Crypto Shift: US Treasury Eyes Bitcoin Custody with Crypto Firms!,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-treasury-bitcoin-custody/,"Is the U.S. Treasury making a bold move into the world of cryptocurrency? Recent reports suggest they are, and it could be a monumental shift for the digital asset landscape. Imagine the U.S. government holding a national Bitcoin reserve – sounds like something out of a futuristic financial thriller, right? But this might be closer to reality than you think. Let’s dive into the details of the U.S. Treasury’s exploration of Bitcoin custody with crypto firms and what it could mean for the future of finance. Why is the US Treasury Exploring Bitcoin Custody? According to a report by Decrypt, the U.S. Treasury has engaged in discussions with several crypto firms , including Anchorage Digital, a prominent crypto custody provider. The core topic? Safeguarding a potential national Bitcoin reserve. This isn’t just a casual chat; it’s a serious exploration into how the government could securely manage and store Bitcoin on a large scale. Think about it – for a government accustomed to dealing with gold reserves and traditional financial instruments, venturing into the realm of digital assets like Bitcoin is a significant leap. So, why are they considering this? Diversification and Modernization: Nations are constantly looking to diversify their reserves and stay ahead of the curve in global finance. Bitcoin, as a growing and increasingly recognized digital asset, could be seen as a modern addition to traditional reserves. Strategic Foresight: Governments need to plan for the future. Recognizing the growing importance of cryptocurrencies, exploring Bitcoin custody now could be a proactive step towards understanding and potentially utilizing digital assets in the future. Understanding Market Dynamics: By engaging with crypto firms and exploring custody solutions, the U.S. Treasury gains valuable insights into the workings of the crypto market, its infrastructure, and the technological underpinnings of digital assets. Anchorage Digital at the Forefront of Bitcoin Custody Discussions Anchorage Digital, a well-known name in the digital asset custody space, played a central role in these discussions. CEO Nathan McCauley reportedly shared insights with Treasury officials on best practices for Bitcoin custody . This highlights the government’s interest in leveraging the expertise of established crypto firms to navigate the complexities of digital asset storage and security. What kind of expertise are we talking about? Area of Expertise Relevance to Bitcoin Custody Secure Key Management Crucial for protecting private keys that control access to Bitcoin holdings. Firms like Anchorage specialize in multi-signature and institutional-grade security protocols. Regulatory Compliance Navigating the complex and evolving regulatory landscape of cryptocurrencies is essential. Custody firms are experienced in adhering to KYC/AML requirements and security standards. Operational Security Ensuring the continuous and secure operation of custody infrastructure, including protection against cyber threats and internal risks. Scalability and Infrastructure Handling potentially large volumes of Bitcoin and managing the infrastructure required for secure storage and transaction processing. National Bitcoin Reserve: A Question of When, Not If? The idea of a national Bitcoin reserve is no longer a fringe concept. While the U.S. Treasury is still in the evaluation phase, the very fact that they are engaging in these discussions signals a significant shift in perspective. Several industry leaders are suggesting third-party custody as a viable interim solution. This would allow the government to dip its toes into Bitcoin without immediately building out a complete in-house custody infrastructure. The long-term vision, however, might involve self-custody, granting the government complete control over its digital assets. Third-Party Custody vs. Self-Custody: What’s the Difference? Third-Party Custody: Entrusting a specialized firm like Anchorage Digital to hold and secure the Bitcoin on behalf of the government. This offers immediate access to expertise and established infrastructure but involves reliance on an external entity. Self-Custody: The government takes full responsibility for managing and securing its own Bitcoin holdings, potentially using government agencies or creating new departments for this purpose. This provides maximum control but requires significant investment in technology, security, and expertise. The choice between these two models will depend on various factors, including security considerations, regulatory frameworks, and the government’s long-term strategy for digital asset management. Impact on Stablecoins and Market Structure The Treasury’s exploration of Bitcoin custody isn’t just about Bitcoin itself. The discussions also touched upon the potential impacts on stablecoins and the broader market structure. This is crucial because any significant move by the U.S. government into the crypto space can have ripple effects across the entire ecosystem. Here’s how it could impact stablecoins and market structure: Increased Legitimacy for Crypto: Government involvement, even in an exploratory phase, can lend further legitimacy to the cryptocurrency market as a whole, potentially boosting investor confidence. Regulatory Clarity: As the government delves deeper into digital asset custody , it may lead to clearer regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies, which is something the industry has been eagerly anticipating. Market Stability: A well-managed national Bitcoin reserve could potentially contribute to market stability in the long run, especially if it encourages responsible adoption and reduces market volatility. Stablecoin Scrutiny: The discussions likely involve examining how stablecoins fit into the broader picture and how they might be affected by government involvement in digital assets. This could lead to further regulatory scrutiny or even integration of stablecoins within the traditional financial system. What are the Challenges Ahead? While the prospect of a national Bitcoin reserve is exciting, there are significant challenges to overcome: Security Risks: Securing vast amounts of Bitcoin against hacking, theft, and other cyber threats is paramount. Government-level security requires robust, cutting-edge solutions. Regulatory Hurdles: Existing regulations may not be fully equipped to handle government-held digital asset reserves. New frameworks might be needed to ensure compliance and transparency. Market Volatility: Bitcoin’s price volatility remains a concern. Managing a reserve in a highly volatile market requires careful strategies and risk management. Public Perception: Public and political perception of cryptocurrencies can be mixed. Gaining broad support for a national Bitcoin reserve may require public education and addressing concerns about risk and volatility. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? This development, while still in its early stages, carries significant implications for the crypto community and beyond: Increased Institutional Adoption: The U.S. Treasury’s interest signals a growing acceptance of Bitcoin at the highest levels of government, potentially paving the way for wider institutional adoption. Positive Market Sentiment: News of government exploration into Bitcoin custody can boost market sentiment and attract more investors to the crypto space. Focus on Security and Regulation: The emphasis on Bitcoin custody highlights the critical importance of security and regulatory compliance in the crypto industry. Firms and individuals alike should prioritize these aspects. Future of Finance: This is a strong indicator that digital assets are becoming an integral part of the future financial landscape. Staying informed and adapting to these changes is crucial for anyone involved in finance or technology. Conclusion: A Monumental Step Towards Crypto Integration? The U.S. Treasury exploring Bitcoin custody with crypto firms is more than just a news headline; it’s a potential watershed moment. It suggests a growing recognition of Bitcoin and digital assets as legitimate components of the global financial system. While the journey to a national Bitcoin reserve is still in its early stages and fraught with challenges, the fact that these discussions are happening at the highest levels of government is undeniably significant. This could be the first step towards a future where digital assets are not just a niche market, but a fundamental part of national and global financial strategies.

Singapore-regulated DigiFT, a pioneer in tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), has just announced a groundbreaking launch. They’ve brought Invesco’s private credit token, iSNR, onto the Arbitrum network. This move is a significant leap forward for RWA tokenization, promising to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning DeFi ecosystem. Let’s dive into what this means for you and the future of finance. Unveiling Invesco’s Private Credit Token on Arbitrum: A DeFi Game Changer So, what exactly happened? DigiFT, recognized for its regulated decentralized exchange (DEX) focused on RWAs, has listed Invesco’s iSNR token on Arbitrum. This token is designed to mirror the performance of Invesco’s impressive $6.3 billion U.S. Senior Loan Strategy. What makes this launch truly noteworthy is its potential to inject institutional-grade private credit into the DeFi space. Think about it – access to traditionally exclusive investment strategies now available within the transparent and accessible world of DeFi. This is not just incremental progress; it’s a potentially transformative shift. Here’s a quick breakdown of the key components: DigiFT: A Singapore-regulated DEX specializing in tokenizing real-world assets. Invesco iSNR Token: A token tracking Invesco’s U.S. Senior Loan Strategy, representing private credit exposure. Arbitrum: A leading Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, known for its speed and lower transaction costs. RWA Tokenization: The process of representing real-world assets, like private credit, as digital tokens on a blockchain. DeFi Expansion: This launch expands the scope of DeFi beyond cryptocurrencies to include traditional financial instruments. Why is RWA Tokenization Gaining Momentum in DeFi? RWA tokenization is rapidly becoming a hot topic in the crypto space, and for good reason. It’s about bringing real-world assets – think everything from real estate and commodities to private credit and art – onto the blockchain. Why is this important? Because it unlocks a whole new realm of possibilities for DeFi. Let’s explore the benefits: Increased Liquidity: Tokenizing RWAs can make traditionally illiquid assets more easily tradable and accessible. Imagine fractional ownership of fine art or real estate, easily bought and sold on a DEX. Enhanced Accessibility: DeFi aims to democratize finance. RWA tokenization extends this by offering access to investment opportunities previously limited to institutional investors or high-net-worth individuals. Greater Transparency and Efficiency: Blockchain technology inherently offers transparency and efficiency. Tokenizing RWAs leverages these benefits, streamlining processes and reducing intermediaries. Portfolio Diversification: RWAs can offer diversification benefits to crypto-native portfolios, potentially reducing volatility and enhancing risk-adjusted returns. Yield Opportunities: RWAs can bring real-world yield into DeFi. In the case of Invesco’s iSNR token, it provides exposure to private credit, a traditionally yield-generating asset class. DigiFT and Invesco on Arbitrum: How Does it Work? The collaboration between DigiFT and Invesco, leveraging the Arbitrum network, is a masterclass in strategic partnerships. DigiFT, with its regulatory compliance, provides the platform for tokenization and trading. Invesco, a global investment management giant, brings the institutional-grade asset – private credit. And Arbitrum, a leading Layer-2 solution, offers the scalability and cost-effectiveness needed for DeFi applications. Here’s a closer look at how it works: Token Creation: DigiFT tokenizes Invesco’s U.S. Senior Loan Strategy, creating the iSNR token. This token represents a claim on the underlying private credit assets. Listing on DigiFT DEX: The iSNR token is listed on DigiFT’s regulated DEX, making it available for trading. Arbitrum Integration: By launching on Arbitrum, DigiFT ensures faster transactions and lower gas fees compared to transacting directly on Ethereum mainnet. This is crucial for making RWA trading practical and accessible. Stablecoin Purchases: The iSNR token can be purchased using USDC and USDT, two of the most widely used stablecoins in the crypto ecosystem. This simplifies the entry point for users familiar with DeFi. Regulatory Compliance: DigiFT’s regulatory framework ensures a level of investor protection and operational integrity often lacking in the less regulated corners of DeFi. Why Arbitrum is the Ideal Choice for RWA Expansion in DeFi Arbitrum has emerged as a preferred Layer-2 solution for many DeFi projects, and its selection by DigiFT for this RWA initiative is no coincidence. Arbitrum’s architecture is specifically designed to address the scalability challenges of Ethereum, making it an ideal platform for applications requiring high transaction throughput and low fees, which are essential for the widespread adoption of DeFi and particularly for trading tokenized assets. Key advantages of Arbitrum for RWA tokenization include: Scalability: Arbitrum significantly increases transaction speed and reduces congestion compared to Ethereum mainnet, making trading RWAs more efficient. Low Transaction Fees: Lower gas fees on Arbitrum make frequent trading and smaller transactions economically viable, opening up RWA access to a broader range of users. Ethereum Compatibility: Arbitrum is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), making it easy for developers to port existing Ethereum-based projects and for users to interact with Arbitrum using familiar tools and wallets. Security: While being a Layer-2 solution, Arbitrum inherits the security of the underlying Ethereum network, providing a robust and secure environment for DeFi activities. Growing Ecosystem: Arbitrum boasts a rapidly expanding ecosystem of DeFi protocols, tools, and users, creating a vibrant and interconnected environment for RWA initiatives to thrive. The Vision: Bridging Regulated Onchain Credit and DeFi DigiFT CEO Henry Zhang’s statement, as reported by Cointelegraph, perfectly encapsulates the vision behind this launch. He emphasized the role of the iSNR token in “integrating regulated onchain credit with DeFi and institutional investors.” This highlights the core objective: to create a bridge between the regulated world of traditional finance and the permissionless innovation of DeFi . This integration is crucial for several reasons: Institutional Adoption: Bringing regulated, institutional-grade assets into DeFi can attract larger institutional investors who are currently hesitant due to regulatory uncertainties and lack of traditional financial instruments. Mainstream Adoption: By offering familiar asset classes like private credit in a DeFi format, it can make DeFi more appealing and accessible to a wider audience beyond crypto natives. Ecosystem Maturation: The inclusion of RWAs contributes to the maturation and diversification of the DeFi ecosystem, making it more robust and less reliant solely on volatile crypto assets. Real-World Impact: Tokenizing RWAs can ultimately channel capital from the crypto space into real-world projects and businesses, fostering innovation and economic growth beyond the digital realm. Navigating the Challenges and Looking Ahead for RWA in DeFi While the launch of Invesco’s private credit token on Arbitrum is a significant milestone, the journey of RWA tokenization in DeFi is still in its early stages. There are challenges to overcome and developments to watch out for. Some key challenges include: Regulatory Clarity: The regulatory landscape for RWAs in DeFi is still evolving. Clear and consistent regulations are needed to foster growth and ensure investor protection. Custody and Security: Secure and compliant custody solutions for RWAs are essential. Ensuring the security of underlying assets and the integrity of tokenized representations is paramount. Valuation and Transparency: Establishing reliable valuation mechanisms and ensuring transparency for RWAs can be complex, especially for assets that are not easily priced in public markets. Interoperability: Seamless interoperability between different DeFi platforms and traditional financial systems is crucial for the widespread adoption of RWAs. Education and Adoption: Educating both traditional finance participants and crypto users about the benefits and risks of RWA tokenization is vital for driving adoption. Despite these challenges, the momentum behind RWA tokenization is undeniable. The DigiFT and Invesco collaboration is a powerful example of how traditional finance and DeFi can converge to create new opportunities and reshape the financial landscape. As the DeFi space continues to mature and regulatory frameworks become clearer, we can expect to see even more innovative RWA initiatives emerge, further blurring the lines between the digital and physical worlds of finance. Conclusion: A Transformative Step for DeFi and Beyond DigiFT’s launch of Invesco’s private credit token on Arbitrum is more than just another token listing. It represents a significant step towards realizing the full potential of DeFi by integrating real-world assets. This move not only expands investment options within DeFi but also paves the way for greater institutional participation and mainstream adoption. By leveraging Arbitrum’s scalability and DigiFT’s regulatory compliance, this initiative sets a new precedent for how traditional finance and decentralized technologies can work together to create a more accessible, efficient, and diversified financial future. The revolution of private credit in DeFi is just beginning, and DigiFT is at the forefront, leading the charge.

Zhao Denies Allegations as Warren Criticizes Trump’s Crypto Ties Zhao responded on X after the article’s publication, stating that the report “got the facts wrong.” CZ refutes WSJ’s allegations, stating he never discussed a Binance US deal in exchange for a pardon. #Crypto #BinanceUS https://t.co/3QA8ermJWg — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 13, 2025 “I have had no discussions of a Binance US deal with … well, anyone,” Zhao said in a March 13 X post . “Feels like the article is motivated as an attack on the President and crypto, and the residual forces of the ‘war on crypto’ from the last administration are still at work,” he continued. “I am always happy to make crypto great everywhere, US and the rest of the world.” Trump, who has positioned himself as supportive of the crypto industry in his 2024 campaign, has drawn mixed reactions for his ties to the sector. During a Senate Banking Committee hearing on March 13, Senator Elizabeth Warren criticized World Liberty Financial after a Bloomberg report revealed its discussions with Binance. Bloomberg just broke news that the Trump family’s crypto company has been in discussions with Binance on doing business, including possibly creating a new stablecoin. We have a chance to fix this stablecoin bill to prevent this kind of naked corruption. pic.twitter.com/NdQH4RHnl3 — Senate Banking and Housing Democrats (@SenateBanking) March 13, 2025 “Bloomberg has just broken the news that the Trump family’s crypto company has been in discussions on doing business, including possibly creating a new stablecoin – exactly what we’re debating right now,” Warren said. “For those of you who don’t remember, Binance pleaded guilty to criminal charges for ‘willful failures that allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform,” the Democratic lawmaker continued. “We should be standing up to this kind of naked corruption not trying to figure out how to build some kind of super highway so it can take off even faster, bigger, and better,” she continued. Regulatory Crossroads: Politics Meets Cryptocurrency The alleged talks between the Trump family and Binance.US represent more than just a business negotiation—they symbolize the complex intersection of politics, regulation, and digital finance. As cryptocurrency increasingly becomes a partisan battlefield, with Republicans championing industry growth and Democrats like Warren raising alarm bells about potential misconduct, the future of digital asset policy hangs in balance. The advancement of the GENIUS Act signals a potential shift in stablecoin regulation despite vocal opposition. Whether these developments lead to meaningful oversight or regulatory capture will depend largely on which voices ultimately shape policy. For investors and industry participants, these political dynamics may prove just as consequential as market movements in determining crypto’s American future . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How do these talks reflect the mix of politics and digital finance? These discussions reveal how political ties and crypto business converge, fueling debates on market oversight and ethics. The potential shift in focus may reshape how the public views digital finance. Could these interactions influence future crypto regulations?

What broader effects might arise from political influence in crypto deals? A3: These engagements may blur the lines between political involvement and market decisions, prompting closer review of financial ties. Experts warn that thorough review is key to keeping digital finance fair.

The Hoodi testnet will launch on March 17 and the Pectra upgrade for it will be activated on March 26, Ethereum Foundation developer Tim Beiko said following the Ethereum All Core Dev Call on March 13. If Pectra runs smoothly on Hoodi without major issues, core developers could set a mainnet launch date for Pectra as soon as 30 days after Hoodi’s activation, Beiko said. That would mean Pectra could go live on Ethereum mainnet as early as April 25. Tim Beiko’s latest announcement on the Pectra upgrade: Ethereum Magicians Pectra, which combines features from the Prague and Electra proposals, will implement over 10 Ethereum Improvement Proposals mostly aimed at bringing more functionality to Ethereum wallets and improving user experience. It will also include scaling proposals to double the blob count for data availability from three to six. Pectra was initially slated to launch on Ethereum mainnet in late 2024 but has faced repeated delays due to client readiness issues and synchronization bugs in the first two Ethereum testnets, Holesky and Sepolia. Pectra was rolled out on Sepolia on March 5, but soon after, Ethereum developers started seeing error messages on their geth nodes and empty blocks being mined. Galaxy Digital vice president of research Christine Kim said Hoodi would look to “mimic” the Ethereum mainnet as closely as possible by launching a validator set similar to how mainnet currently operates. That would see at least 20 million test staked-Ether ( ETH ) distributed across 11 client teams and five staking operators. Source: Christine Kim Beiko noted that aspects of Pectra may still be tested on Sepolia and Holesky. Related: Ethereum average gas fees drop 95% one year after the Dencun upgrade The third testnet comes as Ethereum core developers agreed to deploy future Ethereum protocol upgrades at a faster cadence during an “All Core Devs” meeting on Feb. 13.

The world of tokenized assets just witnessed a monumental leap forward. BlackRock, the undisputed titan of asset management, is making serious waves in the digital realm. Their tokenized fund, BUIDL, has absolutely exploded in growth, smashing through the $1 billion mark in assets under management (AUM). This incredible surge comes hot on the heels of a massive $200 million investment from crypto protocol innovator, Ethena. Let’s dive deep into what this sensational development signifies for the future of finance and the ever-evolving landscape of digital asset markets. BlackRock BUIDL: A Tokenized Fund Revolution So, what exactly is BlackRock BUIDL and why is this milestone such a big deal? BUIDL isn’t your average investment fund. It’s a tokenized fund, meaning it represents ownership of traditional assets – in this case, U.S. Treasuries – on a blockchain. Think of it as bridging the gap between the traditional financial world and the cutting-edge world of crypto. This innovative approach offers a multitude of benefits, making it an attractive proposition for investors seeking exposure to digital asset markets. Transparency and Efficiency: Blockchain technology inherently provides transparency. Every transaction and holding within the BUIDL fund is recorded on a public ledger, offering unprecedented visibility. This also streamlines processes, potentially reducing administrative overhead and improving efficiency compared to traditional funds. Accessibility and Fractional Ownership: Tokenization allows for fractional ownership. Investors can access a portion of high-quality assets like U.S. Treasuries with smaller investment amounts than typically required in traditional markets. This democratizes access and opens up new avenues for participation in sophisticated financial instruments. Instant Settlement and 24/7 Trading Potential: While not fully realized yet, tokenized assets have the potential for near-instant settlement and 24/7 trading. This contrasts sharply with the slower settlement times and limited trading hours of traditional financial markets, offering greater flexibility and liquidity. Ethena’s $200 Million Crypto Investment: Fueling the Fire The catalyst for BUIDL’s meteoric rise to over $1 billion AUM? A substantial $200 million crypto investment from Ethena, a protocol known for its innovative approach to stablecoins and synthetic dollars. Ethena’s strategic move highlights the growing confidence within the crypto space in tokenized real-world assets. This injection of capital not only boosted BUIDL’s asset base but also signaled a significant endorsement from a key player in the digital asset markets. Why did Ethena choose to invest such a large sum? It’s likely a multifaceted decision driven by: Yield Opportunities: BUIDL, backed by U.S. Treasuries, offers a yield that can be attractive in the current low-interest-rate environment. For crypto protocols like Ethena, seeking stable and potentially higher yield-generating avenues for their reserves, BUIDL presents a compelling option. Collateral Utility: As the article mentions, BUIDL is being used as collateral in various digital asset markets. This utility is crucial for the DeFi (Decentralized Finance) ecosystem. Ethena’s investment could be partly driven by the desire to utilize BUIDL as collateral within their own or partner platforms. Strategic Alignment: Both BlackRock and Ethena are pushing the boundaries of traditional finance and crypto. Ethena’s investment could be seen as a strategic alignment with BlackRock’s foray into tokenization, further legitimizing and accelerating the adoption of these technologies. Tokenized Fund Integration: Reshaping Digital Asset Markets The fact that BUIDL is being actively used as collateral underscores the increasing integration of tokenized financial instruments into the broader digital asset markets. This is not just about hype; it’s about tangible utility and real-world application. Tokenized funds like BUIDL are starting to play a critical role in: Area Impact of Tokenized Funds DeFi Lending & Borrowing Provides high-quality, liquid collateral options, reducing risk and enhancing stability in DeFi protocols. Stablecoin Ecosystem Offers diversification and yield opportunities for stablecoin reserves, potentially improving the resilience of the stablecoin market. Institutional Adoption Facilitates institutional participation in digital assets by offering familiar structures (funds) with exposure to blockchain technology. Cross-Chain Interoperability Tokenized assets can potentially bridge different blockchain ecosystems, fostering greater connectivity and capital flow. Challenges and the Path Forward for Crypto Investment While the $1 billion milestone for BUIDL is undeniably exciting, it’s important to acknowledge that the journey of tokenized funds and crypto investment is not without its challenges. Some key hurdles include: Regulatory Clarity: The regulatory landscape for tokenized assets is still evolving globally. Clear and consistent regulations are crucial for fostering wider adoption and ensuring investor protection. Interoperability Standards: Lack of standardized protocols for tokenized assets across different blockchains can hinder seamless integration and interoperability. Custody and Security: Secure custody solutions for tokenized assets, especially at institutional scale, are paramount. Ensuring the safety and integrity of these digital holdings is critical. Education and Awareness: Broader education and awareness are needed to demystify tokenization and its benefits for both institutional and retail investors. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? So, what are the key takeaways from this explosive growth of BlackRock’s BUIDL and Ethena’s crypto investment? Here are some actionable insights: Keep an Eye on Tokenization: Tokenization is not just a buzzword; it’s a fundamental shift in how assets can be represented and traded. Understanding this trend is crucial for navigating the future of finance. Explore Digital Asset Markets: Even if you’re a traditional investor, the lines between traditional and digital finance are blurring. Consider exploring the potential of digital asset markets and the role tokenized assets are playing. Stay Informed on Regulatory Developments: The regulatory environment will significantly impact the growth trajectory of tokenized assets. Staying informed about regulatory changes is essential for making informed investment decisions. Due Diligence is Key: As with any investment, thorough due diligence is paramount in the crypto space. Understand the risks and rewards before investing in tokenized funds or other digital assets. A Billion-Dollar Beginning: The Future is Tokenized BlackRock’s BUIDL surpassing $1 billion in AUM is more than just a number; it’s a powerful signal. It signifies the growing acceptance and adoption of tokenized assets by major financial institutions and crypto-native protocols alike. Ethena’s substantial crypto investment is a testament to the potential and utility of BUIDL and tokenized funds in general. While challenges remain, this milestone marks a significant step towards a future where finance is increasingly digital, transparent, and accessible, powered by the transformative potential of blockchain technology. The tokenization revolution is gaining momentum, and the journey has just begun.

The purchase was executed through two transactions on March 13, 2025, via the crypto exchange Coinbase. This is in line with the firm’s ongoing plan of holding a major position in digital assets as it expresses confidence in Bitcoin. Ark Invest Acquires 997 BTC Through Coinbase According to data from Arkham Intelligence , Ark Invest acquired 997 BTC worth $80 million from Coinbase on March 13, 2025. The transaction was split into two parts: the first purchase included 498 BTC, while the second, completed four hours later, added 499 BTC. The acquisition occurs at a time when Ark Invest is seeking to increase its Bet on Bitcoin. Currently, institutional investors remain very active holders of cryptocurrencies and a large number are invested in Bitcoin ETFs. The most recent acquisition shows that the firm is willing to remain in the digital asset sector regardless of the price swings. However, apart from this latest BTC purchase, Ark Investment has sold roughly $9 million of its BTC ETFs invested in the company. This sentiment is in line with other institutions selling, as $1.1 billion exited spot Bitcoin ETF. The reason for this can be attributed to a declining performance of the US stock market, inflation concerns, and uncertainties in trade policies. Ark Invest Rebalances Portfolio In addition to acquiring Bitcoin, Ark Invest recently increased its Coinbase (COIN) stock holdings. The firm purchased 64,358 shares of Coinbase, valued at approximately $11.53 million. This marks its largest investment in Coinbase stock since August 2024. Unlike previous portfolio adjustments, Ark Invest did not sell its spot Bitcoin ETF holdings. The firm’s decision to retain Bitcoin while expanding its Coinbase stock holdings suggests a strategic shift in its investment approach. Analysts view this move as part of Ark Invest’s long-term strategy in the digital asset sector. Bitcoin Price Action Amid Institutional Interest In recent weeks, Bitcoin price shifted due to institutional buying and selling together with other factors in the crypto market. Ironically, BTC has remained an essential commodity for long-term investors who keep amassing. More so, Cathie Wood remains a supporter of Bitcoin. Cathie previously forecasted an increase in BTC price to $1 million per coin by 2030. Nevertheless, Bitcoin’s strength has diminished due to the trading war impact, which makes the asset still bearish. Bitcoin price traded in the $79,000 range before rising back to the $81,000 mark, but faced resistance at the $83,700 level. In case, the selling pressure continues, BTC price may further decline towards the $75,000 Support level.

They introduced 6 repositories, that would appeal to crypto developers, and added malware, to create backdoors, infiltrate projects, and steal credentials. The hacking group would use BeaverTail, a malware package, to execute a hidden file on the target system. The malware would then steal credentials by accessing browser files and searching for files related to cryptocurrency wallets like Exodus. The stolen data would then be sent to a command and control centre so that the hackers could readily access the sensitive files. “Attributing this attack”, wrote Kirill Boychenko, Socket Seniority Analyst, “definitively to Lazarus or a sophisticated copycat remains challenging, as absolute attribution is inherently difficult. However, the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) observed in this npm attack closely align with Lazarus’s known operations, extensively documented by researchers from Unit42, eSentire, DataDog, Phylum, and others since 2022”. The NPM repositories were based on actual libraries, but used typosquatting and similar spelling to mimic popular packages and trick developers into installing them. The malicious packages were downloaded over 300 times, showing the reach of the attack. The six malicious packages include: is-buffer-validator – mimics is-buffer library, steals credentials. yoojae-validator – fake validator, steals sensitive data. event-handle-package – pretends to be an event handling tool, but installs a back door for remote access. array-empty-validator – collects browser and system credentials. react-event-dependency – pretends to be a react utility, but compromises developer environments. auth-validator – steals login and API credentials. “The APT group”, wrote Boychenko, “created and maintained GitHub repositories for five of the malicious packages, lending an appearance of open source legitimacy and increasing the likelihood of the harmful code being integrated into developer workflows”. The malware was designed to collect system information, such as operating system, system directories, and hostname, deploying this attack to hundreds of NPM users. “It systematically iterates through browser profiles”, wrote Boychenko, “to locate and extract sensitive files such as Login Data from Chrome, Brave, and Firefox, as well as keychain archives on macOS. Notably, the malware also targets cryptocurrency wallets, specifically extracting id.json from Solana and exodus.wallet from Exodus”. This attack is part of Lazarus Group’s broader strategy to disrupt supply chains. The NPM malware allows them to target developers, a vital part of the global supply chain, and embed themselves inside systems, development environments, and crypto addresses to further their attacks. Similar methods have been used to target GitHub and Python’s pip packages. “Continuous monitoring of unusual dependency changes”, wrote Boychenko, “can expose malicious updates while blocking outbound connections to known C2 endpoints prevents data exfiltration. Sandboxing untrusted code in controlled environments and deploying endpoint protection can detect suspicious file system or network activities”. Boychenko raises a critical point because developers, due to tight deadlines, often use many libraries without fully checking them. Cryptocurrency, being decentralized, allows developers to collaborate over vast distances, but also increases the attack vector of open source projects. According to the United Nations 2024 report, North Korean hackers were responsible for 35% of cryptocurrency thefts, amounting to $1 billion in lost crypto. The hackers pose a new kind of security threat, being state actors, because they may use their accumulated wealth to fund nuclear weapons programs and ballistic missile enhancements.",Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News|North Korea,EN,0,0,APT|ASIA|SOL,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-14 00:29:29

Gox Transfers. Glassnodes’s accumulation trend score shows shifts in investor sentiment and increased selling pressure. Mt. Gox transfers are affecting markets but are overshadowed by tariff concerns. Bitcoin’s ( BTC-USD ) rollercoaster ride continues as President Donald Trump and his tariff policies ramp up and weigh on overall market sentiment. The bitcoin price has been flirting with the $80,000 per bitcoin handle, dragging down the wider crypto market that’s now erased $1 trillion of value in just a month. The hype around President Trump and his pro-crypto policies have faded as the effects of a global trade war take hold of financial markets. The tariff proposals by President Trump have for now cast a shadow over markets with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink stating that if people become more focused on supporting their own country, often referred to as nationalism, it could lead to higher inflation. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, as some might find it appealing, but it would likely have an impact on prices. Fears of a recession have also ramped up and thus weighing on crypto markets. Goldman Sachs economists have increased the chances of a recession in the next year from 15% to 20%. They pointed to Trump’s economic policies as the main concern. Yardeni Research economists also raised their recession estimate, from 20% to 35%, blaming Trump’s rapid actions with executive orders, firings, and tariffs. Crypto Heatmap, March 13, 2025 Source: TradingView Was Mt. Gox Responsible for the Recent Selloff? According to Lookonchain, Mt. Gox moved 11,834 bitcoins this month, including 11,502 to an unknown wallet. A recent transfer of $1.07 billion in March, followed by a complex repayment process starting in July 2023 and ending on October 31, has raised questions. Why now? The timing may be tied to the legal details of creditor repayments. Every action from Mt. Gox still rattles the crypto world, even years after its 2014 bankruptcy. The platform still holds significant influence over the market. However, so far, no large sell-offs have followed these repayments. Creditors, many of whom are experienced “hodlers,” appear to take a cautious approach rather than panicking. The extension of the repayment deadline to October 2024, announced at the end of 2023, has brought some relief. But the market operates on fear and instinct, and Mt. Gox continues to stir uncertainty. Fear, after all, often builds on itself. Some bitcoins were moved to a hot wallet, which is often used for quick access to funds and could suggest a future sale. However, most of the bitcoins ended up in a “new wallet,” likely as a temporary step before being distributed further. This seems to be a cautious approach rather than an aggressive one. Still, the market tends to overreact, treating every unknown wallet as a potential threat and every transaction as a warning sign. Thus, the question is whether this was the reason for the selloff in crypto markets. While I believe this played a part, the ongoing pressure on Bitcoin prices is more indicative of fear across markets rather than a Mt.Gox situation. Looking back at the market’s reaction during previous Mt. Gox moves, and it is clear that the moves did not have a long-lasting impact on crypto prices. The current decline and lack of a sustainable recovery suggest a different dynamic this time around. Glassnode – The Week On-Chain Bitcoin’s price cycles move between phases of buying (accumulation) and selling (distribution), with money shifting between different groups of investors over time. The Accumulation Trend Score measures these changes, with scores near 1 (dark purple) showing strong buying activity and scores near 0 (yellow) showing selling activity. The chart shows that after periods of heavy accumulation, selling phases often follow, leading to weaker price movements. The most recent selling phase started in January 2025, matching Bitcoin’s drop from $108,000 to $93,000. Right now, the Accumulation Trend Score is below 0.1, indicating ongoing strong selling pressure. Source: Glassnode The Accumulation Trend Score tracks how total Bitcoin balances on the blockchain are changing. However, it is influenced more by the actions of big players and doesn’t show where the Bitcoin was bought. While it’s useful for spotting general buying or selling trends, it doesn’t provide detailed information about key price levels where Bitcoin was acquired. The cost-basis of Short-Term Holders ((STH)) shows that market momentum has turned negative, with less demand and growing uncertainty among investors. Signs of fear-driven selling are clear, as the STH-SOPR (a measure showing profit or loss for short-term sellers) stays below 1, meaning most are selling at a loss. At the same time, STH-CDD (a measure of recent-holder activity) has jumped, showing more selling by short-term investors. This wave of selling matches the market trading near its lower range. Many recent buyers are likely feeling significant financial pressure during this time. All of the above does not currently inspire confidence for a sustained bullish move. The biggest takeaway and something which we are seeing in US Equity markets is the lack of dip-buying this time around. Not a surprise as markets are currently in a phase of capital preservation and risk aversion with no end in sight given the pending universal tariffs being proposed by the Trump administration. It looks like a bumpy road ahead, so strap in and enjoy the ride. Technical Analysis – BTC/USD Bitcoin from a technical standpoint on the daily timeframe remains in a bearish trend. A daily candle close above the 90000 handle will be needed for a change in structure and this remains some distance away at present. Today it was the 200-day MA which served as a significant area of resistance and capped yesterday's attempted rally to the upside as well. The decline today, found support at the 80000 handle with a brief foray below being met with some buying pressure. However, the daily candle closed as a bearish engulfing candle, which hints at further downside ahead. Looking at the potential of a break to the downside, and we have support at the 78197 handle before the 75000 handle comes into focus. Below the 75000 mark, the swing high from October 2024 at 73777 may be a key area to keep an eye on. A move higher from current prices may find resistance at 82133 and the 200-day MA at 83636. Next focus will shift to the 85000 handle and the 90000 handle respectively.

If you’re using a Trezor Safe 3 hardware wallet, you need to pay close attention. A recent disclosure from Trezor has sent ripples through the crypto community, highlighting a potential vulnerability in their latest device. But before you panic and start moving your funds, let’s break down exactly what’s happening, what it means for you, and most importantly, how to stay secure. This isn’t just another news flash; it’s a crucial update that could impact your digital asset security. What is the Trezor Safe 3 Vulnerability? Unpacking the Voltage Glitching Threat The buzz is all about a potential weakness in the Trezor Safe 3, uncovered by security experts at Ledger Donjon – yes, you read that right, Ledger, a competitor, identified this. This isn’t your everyday software bug; it’s a hardware-level concern involving something called voltage glitching . But what exactly is voltage glitching, and why should you care? In simple terms, voltage glitching is a sophisticated attack method where hackers manipulate the voltage supplied to a device’s chip. By causing brief voltage fluctuations at just the right moment, attackers can disrupt the normal operation of the chip and potentially bypass security measures. In the case of the Trezor Safe 3, this could theoretically be used to extract your crypto private keys . Here’s a breakdown of what we know: The Vulnerability: Voltage glitching attack on Trezor Safe 3. The Discoverer: Ledger Donjon security researchers. The Risk: Potential exposure of private keys if an attacker gains physical access to your device. Affected Model: Specifically Trezor Safe 3. Older models like Model One, Model T, and the newer Safe 5 are reportedly not affected. It’s important to understand that this isn’t a remote exploit. An attacker would need physical possession of your Trezor Safe 3 to even attempt this. However, the fact that such a method exists is definitely something to be aware of. Hardware Wallet Security: Why is This News Important? Hardware wallets like Trezor are designed to be fortresses for your crypto. They keep your private keys offline, away from the prying eyes of online hackers. This is why they are considered the gold standard for hardware wallet security and safeguarding your digital assets. When a potential vulnerability surfaces, even if it requires physical access, it’s a big deal. It reminds us that no system is completely impenetrable, and constant vigilance is key. Why is this vulnerability noteworthy? Highlights the Complexity of Hardware Security: Even with robust security measures, hardware can have vulnerabilities. Emphasizes the Need for Continuous Scrutiny: Security research, even from competitors, plays a vital role in making crypto safer. Reinforces Best Practices: This incident underscores the importance of physical security and using additional security features like passphrases and strong PINs. Think of your hardware wallet as a physical safe for your crypto. While incredibly secure, it’s not invincible. Just like a physical safe can be cracked by a determined thief with the right tools and time, hardware wallets can also be targeted with sophisticated hardware attacks. Crypto Private Keys: The Heart of Your Digital Assets at Risk? Your crypto private keys are essentially the master passwords to your cryptocurrency holdings. They allow you to authorize transactions and control your funds. If these keys are compromised, you could lose access to your crypto. This is why hardware wallets are designed to keep these keys ultra-secure, generating and storing them offline, within the device itself. The potential voltage glitching attack on the Trezor Safe 3 raises concerns because it could, in theory, allow an attacker to extract these critical private keys. Imagine someone getting the keys to your digital kingdom – that’s the level of risk we’re talking about. Key takeaways about private keys and this vulnerability: Private Keys are Paramount: Protect them at all costs. Hardware Wallets Enhance Security: They are still the most secure way to store private keys. Vulnerability is Potential, Not Guaranteed: Exploiting voltage glitching is complex and requires specialized skills and equipment. Trezor’s Response is Crucial: How Trezor addresses this will be key to maintaining user trust. Ledger Donjon’s Discovery: A Competitor Helping the Community? It might seem surprising that Ledger Donjon , the security research team from Trezor’s main competitor Ledger, is the one who discovered and reported this vulnerability. However, in the world of crypto security, collaboration and shared knowledge are often prioritized over competitive advantage. Finding and disclosing vulnerabilities benefits the entire crypto ecosystem. This act highlights a positive aspect of the crypto community: Community-Driven Security: Researchers from different companies contribute to overall security. Transparency and Disclosure: Openly reporting vulnerabilities helps users and manufacturers improve security. Ethical Hacking for Good: Ledger Donjon’s work exemplifies ethical hacking aimed at strengthening the crypto space. While Ledger and Trezor are competitors in the hardware wallet market, their shared interest in a secure crypto environment outweighs their rivalry in this instance. It’s a testament to the collaborative spirit within the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry when it comes to security. Actionable Insights: How to Protect Your Trezor Safe 3 (and Any Hardware Wallet) So, what should you do if you own a Trezor Safe 3? And what are some general best practices for hardware wallet security? Here are some actionable insights to bolster your crypto security: Purchase from Official Sources: Always buy your hardware wallet directly from the official Trezor website or authorized resellers. This minimizes the risk of receiving a tampered device. Use a Strong PIN: Set a strong and unique PIN for your Trezor Safe 3. Don’t use easily guessable numbers like birthdays or sequential digits. Enable a Passphrase: A passphrase adds an extra layer of security to your wallet. It’s like having a 25th word to your recovery seed phrase, making it significantly harder for anyone to access your funds even if they have your PIN and physical device. Physical Security is Key: Keep your Trezor Safe 3 in a secure location. Don’t leave it unattended in public places. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on updates from Trezor and the crypto security community. Be aware of potential threats and security recommendations. Consider Device Reseeding (If Concerned): While likely unnecessary for most users in this specific scenario given the physical access requirement for the exploit, for extreme caution, you could consider reseeding your wallet on a different device if you have significant concerns, then transferring back to your Safe 3 after ensuring you’ve taken all recommended security steps and Trezor’s official guidance. This is an advanced step and should be approached cautiously, ensuring you understand the process fully to avoid losing access to your funds. Trezor’s official advice is to purchase wallets from official sources and utilize passphrases and strong PINs – solid advice that every hardware wallet user should follow regardless of this specific vulnerability. Looking Ahead: Trezor’s Response and the Future of Hardware Wallets The crypto world is constantly evolving, and security threats are a persistent reality. The disclosure of this potential Trezor Safe 3 vulnerability serves as a valuable reminder of the ongoing need for vigilance and innovation in hardware wallet security. What happens next is crucial. We expect Trezor to: Acknowledge and Address: Trezor has already acknowledged the issue and is likely working on mitigation strategies. Provide Updates: Users will need clear communication and updates on the situation and any recommended actions. Enhance Security Measures: This incident will likely spur further research and development into hardware wallet security, potentially leading to even more robust defenses against physical attacks. Ultimately, hardware wallets remain the most secure way to store your crypto. This potential vulnerability, while concerning, doesn’t negate the fundamental security benefits they offer. It simply highlights that security is an ongoing process, and even the most trusted systems require constant scrutiny and improvement. In conclusion, while the news of a potential vulnerability in the Trezor Safe 3 is unsettling, it’s not a reason to abandon hardware wallets. Instead, it’s a call to action to reinforce best security practices, stay informed, and appreciate the ongoing efforts to make the crypto world a safer place. Keep your PINs strong, your passphrases secure, and always buy from official sources. Your crypto security is in your hands!

After a steady upward climb, buying momentum has weakened as sellers step in to defend this key level. A successful breakout could signal a continuation of the uptrend, driving XRP toward new highs and reinforcing positive sentiment in the market. However, if buyers fail to overcome this hurdle, XRP may face a pullback, with traders eyeing lower support levels for stability. Market participants are closely monitoring whether the bullish momentum is strong enough to push past the resistance or if selling pressure will force a temporary retreat. Market Sentiment And XRP’s Resistance Struggle Market sentiment remains a key factor in XRP’s ongoing battle against the $2.2546 resistance level. While bulls try to drive the price higher, the lack of strong follow-through suggests lingering uncertainty among traders. The resistance level has become a critical test, with buyers needing to sustain momentum to confirm a breakout. Related Reading: XRP Faces Bearish MVRV Crossover—Price Plunge To Continue? Broader market conditions, including Bitcoin’s movement and overall investor confidence, are influencing XRP’s price action. A surge in trading volume and renewed buying pressure could provide the necessary strength for a breakout. However, if sellers continue to defend this level, XRP may struggle to gain further ground, leading to potential profit-taking and a short-term pullback. Furthermore, after crossing above the 50% mark, the RSI is now dipping below it, creating uncertainty among traders. This shift reflects a tug-of-war between buyers and sellers, leaving XRP in a state of market indecision. Without a clear directional push, price movement could remain volatile as traders await stronger signals for the next move. For the bulls to regain control, market sentiment must shift decisively in their favor, with technical indicators aligning to support an upward push. Until then, XRP remains at a crossroads, with both breakout and rejection scenarios still in play. Breakout Potential: What Needs To Happen? For XRP to break above the $2.2546 resistance level, bulls must generate strong momentum backed by increasing buying pressure. A sustained push beyond this critical level, confirmed by a decisive daily close, might set the stage for further gains. Its ability to stabilize above $2.2546 may attract more traders looking to ride the breakout, potentially driving the price toward higher targets such as $2.6482 and $2.9272. Related Reading: XRP Faces Make-Or-Break Moment Amid Bearish Threat Also, XRP’s price must break above the 100-day SMA, and the RSI needs to rise above the 60% threshold. Breaking above these levels could pave the way for more growth, while failure to do so may leave XRP vulnerable to consolidation or a pullback.

A contentious effort to reform the blockchain network's generous inflation regime flopped on Thursday after supporters of SIMD-0228 failed to garner the supermajority they needed to implement the major economic change. The surprise result delivered a blow to the Solana power brokers who rallied to replace Solana's static inflation mechanics with a market-based system. Their proposal likely would have cut the network's 4.7% annual staking rewards down to 1% or less. In a contest that pitted Solana's influential leaders and investors – who claim the network's high staking rewards are bad for SOL's price – against small-time operators who feared the effects of a big cut to their revenue, the opposition rallied hardest on Thursday, as late-voting validators' ballots broke heavily in favor of ""no."" That was enough to scuttle the first major attempt at lowering Solana's uncommonly high staking emissions rate. Among the most valuable programmable blockchains by market cap, Solana issues comparatively large sums of new tokens to its validators, the computer operations that power proof-of-stake blockchains. Much like election night in the U.S., SIMD-0228's weeklong political circus featured betting, ranting, data threads, chart-reading wonkery, endless social media debates and more than a bit of heated name-calling. One validator put their votes up for sale. Many others split their tickets. It crescendoed with a dramatic rush of ballots cast by many of Solana's 1300 validators. In the end, the opposition won an exceptionally high turnout election that laid bare the divide between big and small validators. In the end, SIMD-0228 became the network's first economic reform to fail at the polls. Little stakers Solana validators are only called upon to vote when the network is grappling with a major economic change, said Jonny, the operator of the Solana Compass validator. SIMD-0228 is the third ever such vote to appear in records by StakingFacilities.com (the current proposal went up for consideration with an unrelated SIMD that passed). Its controversies sparked the highest turnout vote in the network's history. Over 66% of validators cast votes, according to a dashboard from Flipside Crypto . Together they wielded 75% of the network's voting power, a remarkable share given voting in this decentralized system is voluntary. Of participating validators with 500,000 SOL or less, over 60% voted against SIMD-0228, per a Dune dashboard . Larger validators saw the exact opposite: of validators with more than 500,000 SOL, 60% voted in favor. The lopsided results suggest opponents' warnings of economic ruin struck a nerve with small-time validators. Big Stakes Proponents of SIMD-0228 believe it would have solved Solana's inflation problem, which they claim drags down SOL's price. Their thinking goes like this: fewer tokens means fewer sellers, and fewer in the hands of tax collectors, too. In place of the network's static 4.7% SOL emissions that validators receive annually, they called for a dynamic system that adjusts to nudge staking trends up or down Opponents, meanwhile, called the proposal reckless and rushed. Some told CoinDesk they suspected its co-author, the influential investment company Multicoin Capital, had written it to favor its own interests. Others publicly warned SIMD-0228 would disrupt elements of Solana's DeFi economy, or turn off institutional investors who they claimed were attracted to SOL's native yield. Some doomsayers even claimed SIMD-0228 would chip away at Solana's decentralization by forcing hundreds of validators with small SOL stakes offline, though others dispute the size of the blow. Solana validators make money based on how much SOL they've staked, either from their own coffers or from tokens delegated to them by others. Those with smaller stakes are more acutely exposed to changes in emissions than those with bigger operators. ""Many people feel like SIMD-0228 is not the best proposal to address inflation on Solana,"" said SolBlaze, a validator operator. ""SIMD-0228 is a significant economic change, and changes on this scale deserve more time to discuss, analyze data, and iterate with feedback from different sectors of the ecosystem."" Reformists aren't going to give up the fight, said Max Resnick, one of the proposal's co-authors and an economic researcher at Anza Labs.

For those in the cryptocurrency space, always watching for tech disruptions and regulatory shifts, Google’s new AI Policy Proposal is a crucial development to understand. It directly addresses the hot-button issues of copyright and export controls, areas that will significantly shape the future of AI and, by extension, the digital landscape where crypto thrives. Why Google’s AI Policy Proposal is Turning Heads Following the Trump administration’s call for a national “AI Action Plan,” Google has released a comprehensive policy document. The core message? The U.S. needs to aggressively champion AI innovation on the global stage. But here’s where it gets interesting: Weakened Copyright Restrictions: Google advocates for ‘fair use’ and ‘text-and-data mining exceptions’ to be broadly applied to AI training data, even if that data is copyrighted. ‘Balanced’ Export Controls: While acknowledging national security, Google pushes for export controls that don’t stifle international business and the export of US AI technologies. Focus on Innovation over Risk: Google argues that AI policymaking has been overly focused on risks, potentially hindering innovation and U.S. competitiveness. They believe the current administration is starting to correct this imbalance. This stance is a clear signal from one of the biggest players in tech. But what exactly does Google want, and what are the implications for the wider tech and crypto ecosystems? Decoding Google’s Copyright Rules Stance: A Win for AI, a Worry for Creators? One of the most contentious parts of Google’s AI Policy Proposal revolves around intellectual property. Like OpenAI, Google wants to solidify the right to train AI models on publicly available data, including copyrighted material, with minimal restrictions. Their argument boils down to: ‘Fair Use’ is Key: Google asserts that ‘fair use’ and text/data mining exceptions are vital for AI development and scientific progress. Streamlined Data Access: They argue these exceptions prevent lengthy and unpredictable negotiations with data holders, speeding up AI development. Minimal Impact on Rightsholders (According to Google): Google claims using copyrighted, publicly available data for AI training doesn’t significantly harm copyright holders. However, this is where the battle lines are drawn. Google is already facing lawsuits from data owners who claim they should have been notified and compensated for the use of their copyrighted material in AI training. The courts are yet to definitively rule on whether ‘fair use’ protects AI developers from these IP claims. For crypto enthusiasts, this raises questions about data ownership, intellectual property in the digital age, and the balance between innovation and creator rights – themes that resonate deeply within the blockchain space. Export Controls: Balancing National Security and Global Business Google also takes aim at the current Export Controls imposed by the Biden administration. Their concern? These controls, while aimed at national security, could backfire by: Undermining Competitiveness: Google suggests export controls place a disproportionate burden on U.S. cloud service providers, making them less competitive globally. Contrasting Views: Interestingly, some of Google’s competitors, like Microsoft, have expressed confidence in their ability to comply with these export rules. Exemptions Exist: It’s important to note that the export rules do include exemptions for trusted companies needing large clusters of advanced AI chips, suggesting a nuanced approach rather than a blanket ban. The debate around Export Controls is crucial. How do we protect sensitive AI technology without stifling innovation and global collaboration? This tension is something that directly impacts the crypto world as well, where global, permissionless systems often clash with national regulatory frameworks. Beyond Copyright and Exports: What Else is in Google’s AI Policy Proposal? Google’s AI Policy Proposal goes beyond just copyright and export controls. Here are some other key recommendations: Sustained R&D Investment: Google calls for long-term, consistent funding for foundational AI research and development, pushing back against recent federal spending cuts. Open Data and Resources: They advocate for the government to release datasets that can aid commercial AI training and to ensure computing resources and AI models are widely accessible to researchers and institutions. Federal AI Legislation: Pointing to the confusing patchwork of state AI laws, Google urges federal AI legislation, including a unified privacy and security framework. The sheer number of pending AI bills (over 781 in early 2025) underscores the urgency for clarity. Liability and Transparency: Google cautions against overly broad liability obligations for AI developers and disclosure requirements, arguing they can be impractical and potentially harmful to innovation and national security. They suggest deployers are often better positioned to manage downstream risks. These points paint a picture of Google’s vision for a thriving AI ecosystem in the U.S. – one that is innovative, competitive, and globally influential. But is it a vision that adequately balances the risks and rewards of AI? The Big Question: Will Google’s Vision Reshape AI Regulation? Google’s AI Regulation proposals are significant because they come from a tech behemoth with immense influence. Their push for weakened Copyright Rules and ‘balanced’ Export Controls will undoubtedly fuel the ongoing debate about how to govern AI. For the crypto community, this is a space to watch closely. The principles being debated around AI – data ownership, regulation vs. innovation, global vs. national interests – are all deeply relevant to the future of decentralized technologies and digital assets. Will policymakers heed Google’s call? Will the courts side with Google on ‘fair use’ for AI training? The answers to these questions will have profound implications for the trajectory of AI development and the broader digital world.

Buckle up, crypto enthusiasts, because recent whispers from Washington suggest a potentially seismic shift in the government’s stance on Bitcoin. Imagine the U.S. government, not just regulating crypto, but actively accumulating it. This isn’t just speculation; it’s hinted at by a key White House official, sparking excitement and raising crucial questions across the digital asset landscape. Let’s dive deep into what this could mean for the future of Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Why the White House is Eyeing Bitcoin Reserves? According to a recent report from Decrypt, Bo Hines, the executive director of the White House’s digital assets working group, dropped a bombshell at a private roundtable. Hines reportedly stated that the Trump administration is seriously considering acquiring “as much Bitcoin as possible.” When pressed on the scale of this potential accumulation of Bitcoin reserves , his analogy was striking: “How many dollars would you want?” This comparison hints at a potentially vast ambition, suggesting Bitcoin might be viewed as a crucial asset on par with traditional currencies. While a White House official confirmed Hines’ statement, they were quick to add a crucial detail: any White House Bitcoin purchases would be “budget-neutral.” This suggests the administration is exploring ways to acquire Bitcoin without directly impacting the federal budget, perhaps through asset reallocation or other innovative financial mechanisms. This approach underscores a strategic, rather than impulsive, interest in Bitcoin reserves . Strategic Bitcoin Reserve: A New National Asset? Hines’ comments also extended to legislative support for a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.” While he didn’t explicitly endorse any specific bill, his indication of support is significant. But what exactly is a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve , and why is it gaining traction in Washington? Think of it like a national oil reserve, but for the digital age. A Strategic Bitcoin Reserve could serve multiple purposes: National Security: In an increasingly digital world, holding a significant Bitcoin reserves could be seen as a matter of national security, ensuring the U.S. remains competitive and influential in the evolving financial landscape. Financial Innovation: Embracing Bitcoin could position the U.S. as a leader in financial innovation, attracting talent and investment in the burgeoning crypto sector. Economic Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to national assets could offer diversification beyond traditional assets, potentially hedging against economic uncertainties and inflation. Geopolitical Influence: In a world where digital currencies are gaining prominence, a substantial Bitcoin reserves could enhance the U.S.’s geopolitical standing in the digital realm. Bitcoin Adoption: Is the US Following Global Trends? The idea of a nation-state holding Bitcoin reserves isn’t entirely novel. Several countries have already started exploring or implementing crypto strategies. El Salvador famously adopted Bitcoin as legal tender, and other nations are considering similar moves or adding Bitcoin to their treasuries. This potential move by the U.S. could be seen as part of a broader trend of global Bitcoin adoption , albeit on a much larger and more impactful scale. Here’s a glimpse at how other nations are approaching Bitcoin: Country Bitcoin Strategy Key Highlights El Salvador Legal Tender First country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender alongside USD. Central African Republic Legal Tender Second nation to make Bitcoin legal tender. Switzerland Crypto-Friendly Hub Known for its progressive crypto regulations and Zug “Crypto Valley.” Ukraine Legalized Crypto Assets Legalized and regulates crypto assets, actively seeking crypto donations. If the U.S. joins this list with a US Bitcoin policy focused on accumulation, it would send a powerful message to the world, potentially accelerating global crypto adoption and legitimizing Bitcoin as a mainstream asset. Navigating the Challenges of US Bitcoin Policy However, the path to establishing significant Bitcoin reserves for the U.S. government is not without its hurdles. Several challenges and considerations need to be addressed: Regulatory Clarity: Clear and consistent regulations are crucial for government entities to confidently engage with Bitcoin. Uncertainty could hinder large-scale acquisitions and management of Bitcoin reserves . Security and Custody: Safeguarding vast amounts of Bitcoin requires robust security measures and secure custody solutions. The government would need to implement state-of-the-art security protocols to prevent theft or loss. Market Volatility: Bitcoin’s price volatility is a significant factor. The government would need strategies to manage the risks associated with price fluctuations in its Bitcoin reserves . Public Perception: Public and political acceptance is essential. Educating the public and policymakers about the benefits and rationale behind a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve will be crucial for garnering support. Budget Neutrality: Ensuring Bitcoin reserves acquisitions are truly budget-neutral, as stated by the White House official, will require careful financial planning and execution. What’s Next for the White House Bitcoin Strategy? The news from the White House is still developing, but it signals a potentially transformative moment for Bitcoin and the crypto industry. While details remain scarce, the mere suggestion of the U.S. government considering large-scale Bitcoin reserves is a game-changer. Keep a close watch on legislative developments, official statements, and market reactions in the coming weeks and months. This could be the beginning of a new era in US Bitcoin policy and global crypto adoption. The implications are far-reaching, potentially impacting everything from Bitcoin’s price trajectory to the broader geopolitical landscape. Is this the dawn of nation-state Bitcoin accumulation? Only time will tell, but the signs are undeniably intriguing. In conclusion, the White House’s consideration of expanding Bitcoin reserves marks a significant shift in the narrative around cryptocurrency. It underscores the growing recognition of Bitcoin’s strategic importance and its potential role in the future financial system. While challenges remain, the potential benefits of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve for national security, financial innovation, and economic diversification are compelling. This development warrants close attention as it unfolds, potentially reshaping the future of finance and the role of digital assets in the global economy.

Could we see a Solana spot ETF hitting the U.S. market sooner than we think? According to Titan founder Chris Chung, the answer might just be yes, and potentially as early as May. Let’s dive into this exciting development and explore what it could mean for Solana and the broader crypto landscape. Why the Buzz Around a Solana Spot ETF? The anticipation for a crypto ETF, particularly a Solana ETF, has been steadily building. But why all the excitement? Essentially, a spot ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) focused on Solana would allow investors to gain exposure to Solana (SOL) without directly holding the cryptocurrency itself. Think of it as buying shares in a fund that holds Solana, making it significantly easier and more accessible for traditional investors to participate in the Solana ecosystem. This ease of access is a major driver behind the push for crypto ETFs in general. Key Benefits of a Solana Spot ETF: Increased Accessibility: A Solana spot ETF would open the doors for retail and institutional investors who are currently hesitant or unable to directly purchase and manage SOL due to regulatory hurdles or technical complexities. Enhanced Liquidity: ETFs are traded on traditional stock exchanges, which are highly liquid markets. This increased liquidity can lead to tighter spreads and easier trading for Solana investors. Regulatory Comfort: For many institutional investors, investing through a regulated ETF structure provides a greater sense of security and compliance compared to directly holding digital assets. This regulatory comfort is crucial for attracting institutional investment into Solana. Tax Advantages: Depending on the jurisdiction, ETFs can offer certain tax advantages compared to directly holding cryptocurrencies. The CME Futures Factor: A Stepping Stone to SEC Approval? Chris Chung’s optimism about SEC approval for a Solana spot ETF by May hinges on a significant development: the upcoming launch of Solana futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). Let’s understand why this is such a crucial factor. The SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) has historically been cautious about approving spot crypto ETFs, primarily due to concerns about market manipulation and investor protection in the underlying spot markets. However, regulated futures markets like the CME are seen as more mature and less susceptible to manipulation due to their oversight and established trading infrastructure. Chung argues that the existence of regulated Solana futures on the CME provides a stronger case for the SEC to approve a Solana spot ETF. Here’s why: Market Maturity Signal: The launch of CME futures signals that Solana is gaining recognition as a mature and established asset class, moving beyond just being considered a speculative memecoin. Surveillance Sharing Agreements: The SEC often requires “surveillance sharing agreements” with regulated exchanges that list futures of the underlying asset for spot ETF approvals. CME futures pave the way for such agreements. Precedent Set by Bitcoin and Ethereum: The SEC’s eventual approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs after CME futures were established sets a precedent. Solana could follow a similar trajectory. VanEck and Canary Capital Leading the Charge Two prominent players, VanEck and Canary Capital, are reportedly leading the charge in seeking SEC approval for a Solana spot ETF. VanEck, a well-known asset manager with a history of crypto ETF filings, and Canary Capital, a digital asset investment firm, are both betting on Solana’s growing prominence in the crypto space. Their applications are likely to highlight Solana’s technological advantages, growing ecosystem, and increasing institutional interest. However, it’s important to remember that the SEC approval process is rigorous and unpredictable. While Chung’s prediction offers a hopeful timeline, the SEC ultimately holds the cards. Challenges and Considerations for Solana ETF Approval Despite the optimism, several challenges and considerations could impact the timeline and likelihood of Solana spot ETF approval: SEC Scrutiny: The SEC remains cautious about crypto assets and could raise further concerns or request additional information, delaying the approval process. Market Volatility: The inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market, including Solana, could be a point of concern for the SEC. Regulatory Landscape: The evolving regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the U.S. adds uncertainty to the approval process. Competition from Other ETFs: The success of already approved Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs could influence the SEC’s decision on Solana, but it also means increased competition in the crypto ETF space. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? Whether you’re a seasoned crypto investor or just starting to explore the space, the potential approval of a Solana spot ETF is something to watch closely. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep track of news and developments related to Solana ETF applications and SEC announcements. Research Solana: If you’re unfamiliar with Solana, now might be a good time to research its technology, ecosystem, and potential. Consider Diversification: A Solana ETF, if approved, could be a way to diversify your crypto portfolio. Manage Expectations: SEC approval is not guaranteed, and even if approved, the timeline could be longer than anticipated. Conclusion: A Potentially Transformative Moment for Solana Chris Chung’s prediction of a potential Solana spot ETF approval by May is undoubtedly exciting news for the Solana community and the broader crypto market. The launch of CME futures is a significant step towards legitimizing Solana as an institutional-grade asset, and the efforts of VanEck and Canary Capital could pave the way for a groundbreaking financial product.

Unlike traditional marketplaces, Web3Bay offers a 5% cashback on every purchase, providing shoppers with real financial rewards through its native 3BAY tokens. This approach isn’t just about getting discounts; it creates a new way for users to earn as they shop, turning routine purchases into rewarding experiences. The platform’s unique earn-as-you-shop model aims to boost user engagement by offering incentives that go beyond traditional loyalty programs. This not only encourages repeated visits but also cultivates a sense of community within its decentralized marketplace. With Web3Bay, shopping becomes an opportunity to save money and earn valuable tokens, making it a standout choice in the world of crypto e-commerce. Web3Bay’s Earn-As-You-Shop Model Explained At the core of Web3Bay’s model is the principle of rewarding users for their activity on the platform. Shoppers receive a 5% cashback in 3BAY tokens on every purchase, instantly turning everyday shopping into a source of income. These tokens can be held for potential value appreciation, used for future purchases, or even traded, offering real versatility. This cashback mechanism works seamlessly within the platform’s blockchain-based infrastructure, ensuring transparency and instant rewards. Unlike traditional cashback programs that might take weeks to process, Web3Bay’s rewards are delivered quickly, providing an immediate incentive to stay engaged. The 3BAY token itself is designed to integrate into the platform’s broader ecosystem, enabling users to participate in governance decisions and access special discounts, further enhancing the shopping experience. Web3Bay’s approach contrasts sharply with typical e-commerce sites, where rewards are often limited to specific products or services. Here, the reward system is intrinsic to every transaction, fostering a genuine earn-as-you-shop experience. This not only motivates users to spend but also builds loyalty by aligning the platform’s growth with the financial benefits of its users. Presale Progress: A Snapshot of Success Web3Bay’s presale is currently in its 5th stage, demonstrating strong momentum and growing interest. The 3BAY token is priced at $0.004562625, offering early participants a chance to secure tokens before the platform’s full launch. The presale has already raised over $1.6 million, and approximately 400 million tokens have been sold, highlighting the project’s potential appeal. Investing in the presale offers more than just the opportunity to buy tokens at a lower price. The anticipated launch price of the 3BAY token is set at $0.1959, which could provide early supporters with a remarkable return on investment of approximately 6,430%. This substantial growth potential is a testament to the market’s confidence in Web3Bay’s vision and its innovative approach to e-commerce. The presale’s progress not only reflects the project’s market traction but also reinforces the value proposition of Web3Bay’s 5% cashback model. By participating now, users can maximize their benefits from both the shopping rewards and potential token appreciation, setting the stage for long-term gains. Creating Real Value with 3BAY Token Rewards The 3BAY token isn’t just a digital reward; it represents real value with multiple utilities within the Web3Bay ecosystem. Users can earn tokens through regular shopping, but the benefits extend far beyond that. The token can be staked to earn additional rewards, used for purchases on the marketplace, or held with the potential for future appreciation as Web3Bay grows. Additionally, the 3BAY token plays a role in the platform’s governance. Token holders gain voting rights, allowing them to influence key decisions about platform development, new features, and community initiatives. This democratic approach empowers users, giving them a voice in the direction of the marketplace while incentivizing them to remain active participants. This model creates a feedback loop where user engagement directly contributes to the platform’s success, and in return, users are rewarded financially. By offering tangible value through the 3BAY token, Web3Bay transforms casual shoppers into invested stakeholders, driving a deeper connection to the platform. How Web3Bay Stands Out in the E-Commerce Market Web3Bay’s 5% cashback offer is a straightforward and powerful incentive that sets it apart from traditional e-commerce models. While most online marketplaces rely on sales and discounts to attract shoppers, Web3Bay’s model adds an earning potential to every purchase. This shift from simply saving money to actually earning tokens redefines how users perceive value when shopping online. The platform’s focus on decentralization also means reduced transaction fees and increased transparency. Without the need for traditional intermediaries, users benefit from lower costs and faster processing times. The cashback rewards are not tied to restrictive conditions or complicated points systems. Instead, every purchase directly benefits the buyer, contributing to an ecosystem where spending and earning are closely linked. Web3Bay also incorporates smart contract technology to manage transactions and rewards automatically. This reduces the risk of errors, ensures the accuracy of cashback rewards, and builds trust among users. The integration of blockchain technology means that all transactions are verifiable, creating a level of transparency that is hard to match in conventional online marketplaces. Loyalty and Long-Term Benefits for Shoppers Web3Bay doesn’t just offer a one-time reward; it encourages long-term engagement through its loyalty programs. Regular shoppers accumulate 3BAY tokens with every purchase, and these tokens can be used for future discounts or staked for more rewards. The platform’s upcoming features, including a planned integration with PayPal, are likely to attract even more users and enhance the versatility of its reward system. The earn-as-you-shop model also introduces an element of strategy. Savvy shoppers can choose to hold onto their 3BAY tokens, potentially benefiting from market value increases as the platform grows. This blend of immediate and long-term rewards helps Web3Bay maintain user interest and loyalty, offering benefits that extend well beyond the checkout process. Web3Bay’s approach transforms shopping into a rewarding activity that benefits users financially while also building a stronger, more vibrant community. By aligning its growth with the interests of its shoppers, the platform creates a mutually beneficial ecosystem where everyone has the opportunity to gain. The Last Line Web3Bay is not just another e-commerce platform—it is a marketplace where every purchase comes with tangible financial rewards. Its 5% cashback model, delivered through the 3BAY token, turns routine shopping into an opportunity to earn. The platform’s combination of instant rewards, long-term incentives, and community-driven governance makes it an attractive choice for anyone looking to get more value from their spending. By offering a seamless and transparent shopping experience, Web3Bay is setting a new standard in the industry. Its earn-as-you-shop model is a powerful draw, providing both discounts and a pathway to earning real digital assets. With the presale already in its 5th stage, the momentum is building, making now an ideal time to get involved. As the platform continues to evolve, it holds the promise of redefining how we think about rewards, loyalty, and the intersection of e-commerce with cryptocurrency.

Vermont’s Department of Financial Regulation said in a March 13 order that in light of the US Securities and Exchange Commission tossing out its case on Feb. 28 , it would follow suit and rescind its action against Coinbase without prejudice. “The SEC has announced the formation of a new task force to, among other things, provide guidance for the promulgation of rules regarding the regulation of cryptocurrency products and services,” the department said. Vermont’s financial regulator has decided to drop its legal action against Coinbase. Source: Vermont’s Department of Financial Regulation “In light of the dismissal of the Federal Action and likelihood of new federal regulatory guidance, the Division believes it would be most efficient and in the best interests of justice to rescind the pending Show Cause Order, without prejudice.” On the same day the SEC filed its lawsuit in June 2023, the US states of Alabama, California, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey, South Carolina, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin said they were launching legal proceedings against Coinbase . The show cause order asserted that Coinbase was violating securities laws by offering staking to its users without a license and demanded the exchange provide a reason why the courts shouldn’t hit them with an order directing them to halt the service. Now that Vermont has opted out, Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal said in a March 13 statement to X that the other states with staking actions should take a “page from Vermont’s playbook.” Source: Paul Grewal “As we have always said: staking services are not securities. We applaud Vermont for embracing progress and providing clarity for its citizens who own digital assets,” he said. “Our work isn’t over. Congress must seize the bipartisan momentum we’re seeing across the House and Senate to pass comprehensive legislation that takes into account the novel features of digital assets, such as staking,” he added.

On-chain data reveals a purchase of 541,242 SEI tokens for a whopping $100,000. This move has sent ripples through the crypto community, sparking discussions about potential implications and motivations behind this substantial crypto investment . Decoding the World Liberty & SEI Token Transaction The transaction, which occurred at 4:11 UTC+8 on March 14, was executed via Cow Protocol, a decentralized trading platform known for its efficiency and MEV protection. According to a post by Wu Blockchain on X (formerly Twitter), the purchased SEI tokens were initially held in the ‘World Liberty address’ before being transferred back to the World Liberty Foundation’s main address. This swift movement raises questions and adds layers of intrigue to the entire operation. Let’s break down the key elements of this developing story: The Players: The central figures are the ‘World Liberty address,’ linked to the Trump family project, and SEI, the native token of the SEI Network. The Transaction: A substantial purchase of 541,242 SEI tokens for $100,000. The Platform: The purchase was made through Cow Protocol, highlighting the use of decentralized platforms for significant crypto transactions. The Source: Information surfaced via Wu Blockchain on X, underscoring the role of crypto-focused social media in breaking news. The Transfer: Tokens were moved from a specific ‘World Liberty address’ back to the World Liberty Foundation’s main address, suggesting a strategic allocation within the organization. Why is this World Liberty Crypto Investment News Significant? The involvement of an entity linked to the Trump family in a crypto investment is noteworthy for several reasons. Firstly, it brings traditional political and business spheres closer to the digital asset space. Secondly, the choice of SEI Network, a relatively newer blockchain focused on speed and scalability, suggests a strategic alignment with projects emphasizing technological advancement in the crypto sector. But why SEI? And why now? Let’s delve deeper into the possible motivations. Potential Reasons Behind the SEI Token Purchase Several theories are circulating within the crypto community regarding the rationale behind this SEI token acquisition by the World Liberty address. Here are a few plausible explanations: Strategic Diversification: World Liberty might be diversifying its portfolio by venturing into promising altcoins like SEI. SEI Network’s focus on DeFi and trading infrastructure could be seen as a future-proof investment. Speculative Investment: The purchase could be purely speculative, betting on the potential price appreciation of SEI tokens. The crypto market is known for its volatility, and strategic investments in promising projects can yield significant returns. Project Partnership: There might be an underlying partnership or collaboration in the works between World Liberty and the SEI Network ecosystem. Investing in SEI tokens could be a precursor to a more significant collaboration. Publicity and Awareness: The association with a known entity like World Liberty and its Trump family links could bring positive attention and publicity to the SEI Network and its token. Analyzing the On-Chain Data: What Does it Tell Us? The beauty of blockchain technology lies in its transparency. On-chain data provides a verifiable record of all transactions, offering insights that are often unavailable in traditional financial systems. In this case, the on-chain data confirms the transaction details – the amount of SEI purchased, the price, the time, and the wallets involved. This transparency is crucial for building trust and verifying information in the often-opaque world of finance. Here’s what analyzing on-chain data can reveal: Data Point Details from On-Chain Analysis Token Purchased SEI Amount 541,242 SEI Purchase Price $100,000 Exchange Platform Cow Protocol Time of Transaction March 14, 4:11 UTC+8 Initial Wallet World Liberty Address (Specific Address – needs further research) Destination Wallet World Liberty Foundation Main Address (Specific Address – needs further research) The Trump Family Crypto Connection: What We Know The phrase “Trump family project” linked to the World Liberty address adds another layer of complexity and interest to this story. While the exact nature of the Trump family’s involvement with World Liberty remains somewhat ambiguous in publicly available information, the association itself draws significant attention. Any venture connected to such a prominent family is bound to generate buzz, especially in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency landscape. It remains to be seen if this World Liberty investment signals a broader interest in crypto from the Trump family or if it’s an isolated strategic move. Navigating Crypto Investments: Key Takeaways This news story serves as a compelling example of the dynamic nature of crypto investment and the increasing intersection of traditional entities with the digital asset world. For those looking to navigate the crypto investment landscape, here are some key takeaways: Due Diligence is Paramount: Always conduct thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency. Understand the project, its team, technology, and market potential. On-Chain Data is Your Friend: Utilize blockchain explorers to verify transactions and gain insights into token movements and wallet activities. Stay Informed: The crypto market is fast-paced. Keep up-to-date with the latest news, trends, and developments through reputable sources. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification across different cryptocurrencies and asset classes can mitigate risk. Understand Risk: Cryptocurrency investments are inherently risky. Only invest what you can afford to lose and be prepared for market volatility. Conclusion: A New Chapter in Crypto and World Liberty? The World Liberty address’s $100,000 purchase of SEI tokens marks a fascinating development in the crypto narrative. Whether this is a strategic long-term investment, a speculative play, or a precursor to something bigger, it undoubtedly underscores the growing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies and the increasing involvement of diverse entities in the digital asset space. As we continue to monitor on-chain data and await further developments, this story serves as a potent reminder of the ever-evolving and often surprising nature of the crypto world. The intersection of traditional entities with the decentralized world of crypto is just beginning, and the implications are vast and yet to be fully realized.

While the price has been making higher highs, the 3-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) has been making lower highs. This suggests that the upward momentum may not be as strong as it appears. According to analyst Josh of Crypto World, the market should not expect any major bullish moves for now. Short-term bounces are normal, but sustained upward momentum like we saw in the past is unlikely in the near future. Struggling at Key Resistance Levels In the shorter term, looking at the 8-hour chart, XRP recently bounced from a support area and moved up towards a resistance zone between $2.25 and $2.30. As anticipated, the price is now struggling at this level. If XRP manages to break above $2.30 and closes a candle above this level, it could indicate a potential continuation towards $2.50-$2.60. However, the next significant resistance area lies between $2.65 and $2.80. Sideways Price Movement and Trading Opportunities Currently, XRP’s price is stuck in a sideways range, struggling to find momentum in either direction. Although the price is bouncing from support, it’s also facing resistance around $2.25 to $2.30. For traders, this creates opportunities to trade within this range. A break below key support levels might signal a short position, while a bounce off support could lead to a long position. Additionally, a confirmed breakout above resistance could present another opportunity for short-term gains. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.25 and is up by more than one percent in the last 24 hours. As for Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency is down by more than two percent and is trading at $81,000.",News|Altcoins|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|BTC|ALTCOIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-14 01:13:14

Sesame AI, the startup famed for its incredibly realistic virtual assistant Maya, has just dropped a bombshell: the base AI model that powers Maya is now open source! This move is poised to democratize advanced voice technology, but also raises some critical questions about the responsible use of such potent tools. For those in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, this news highlights the accelerating pace of innovation in AI and its potential ripple effects across various sectors. What is Sesame’s Open Source AI Model CSM-1B? Sesame’s groundbreaking release is CSM-1B, a 1 billion parameter AI model made available under the permissive Apache 2.0 license. But what does this actually mean? Let’s break it down: Open Source Accessibility: The Apache 2.0 license essentially gives developers a green light to use, modify, and distribute CSM-1B for commercial purposes with minimal restrictions. This open approach is a significant departure from the often-closed nature of cutting-edge AI models. Powering Maya: CSM-1B is the foundational technology behind Maya, Sesame’s viral voice assistant that impressed users with its lifelike speech patterns, including natural breaths and disfluencies. Think of it as the engine that makes Maya sound so human. Technical Deep Dive: CSM-1B generates what Sesame calls “RVQ audio codes” from text and audio inputs. RVQ, or residual vector quantization, is a method for converting audio into discrete tokens. This technique is also used in other advanced AI audio technologies from tech giants like Google and Meta, indicating Sesame is playing in the big leagues. Built on Strong Foundations: The model leverages the architecture of Meta’s Llama family of models as its core, combined with a specialized audio “decoder.” This strategic combination allows CSM-1B to effectively translate text and audio into realistic speech. In essence, Sesame has handed over the keys to a powerful generative AI engine that can create diverse voices. While the released CSM-1B is a base model and not fine-tuned to a specific voice like Maya, it provides a robust starting point for developers to build upon. The Potential and the Pitfalls of Open Source Generative AI The decision to open source CSM-1B is both exciting and potentially fraught with challenges. Let’s explore both sides of the coin: The Upsides: Democratizing AI Innovation Accelerated Development: Open sourcing CSM-1B can foster rapid innovation. Developers worldwide can experiment, improve, and build upon the model, potentially leading to unforeseen advancements in voice assistant technology and AI audio applications. Wider Accessibility: By removing licensing barriers, Sesame is making sophisticated generative AI technology accessible to a broader range of developers, including smaller startups and independent researchers who might not have the resources to build such models from scratch. Transparency and Scrutiny: Open source models are inherently more transparent. The code and architecture are available for public scrutiny, which can lead to better understanding and identification of potential biases or vulnerabilities. The Downsides: Navigating Ethical Gray Areas Lack of Safeguards: Sesame openly admits that CSM-1B has minimal built-in safeguards. This “honor system” approach relies on developers to self-regulate and avoid misuse, which is a significant concern. Potential for Misinformation and Misuse: The ability to clone voices easily, as demonstrated in the demo, opens the door to malicious applications like creating deepfakes, spreading misinformation through realistic fake audio, or impersonating individuals without consent. Imagine the implications for social media or even the cryptocurrency space where scams are already prevalent. Ethical Responsibility: While Sesame urges responsible use, the open-source nature means they have limited control over how CSM-1B is ultimately deployed. The burden of ethical considerations largely falls on the developers and users who adopt the model. Experimenting with CSM-1B: A Minute to Clone Your Voice? The article author’s personal experience of cloning their voice in under a minute using the Hugging Face demo highlights the ease of use and the speed at which realistic voice generation can be achieved with CSM-1B. This rapid cloning capability, while impressive from a technological standpoint, underscores the potential for misuse if not handled responsibly. Sesame’s Vision Beyond Voice Assistants: AI Glasses on the Horizon Sesame, backed by prominent investors like Andreessen Horowitz, isn’t just focused on voice assistant technology. The company is also venturing into hardware, prototyping AI glasses designed for all-day wear, powered by their custom AI models. This ambition signals a broader vision for integrating AI seamlessly into everyday life, moving beyond software applications to wearable technology. What Does This Mean for the Future of AI and Crypto? While seemingly disparate, the advancements in generative AI like Sesame’s CSM-1B have indirect but significant implications for the cryptocurrency and blockchain space. Here’s why: Enhanced User Experience: AI-powered interfaces, including advanced voice assistants, can simplify interactions with complex blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies, making them more accessible to a wider audience. New Applications in Decentralized Systems: AI models like CSM-1B could be integrated into decentralized platforms for various applications, from creating more engaging user interfaces to developing novel forms of content creation and interaction within decentralized ecosystems. Increased Scrutiny and Regulation: The ethical concerns surrounding powerful generative AI technologies will likely intensify the debate around AI regulation. This regulatory landscape will indirectly impact the cryptocurrency space as both sectors grapple with issues of trust, security, and responsible innovation. Conclusion: A Powerful Tool with Great Responsibility Sesame’s release of CSM-1B is a landmark moment in the open-source AI landscape. It offers incredible potential for innovation and democratization of advanced voice technology. However, it also presents significant ethical challenges and underscores the urgent need for responsible development and deployment of such powerful tools. As developers and users gain access to this technology, the onus is on them to wield it ethically and consider the broader societal implications. The future of generative AI is exciting, but navigating its complexities will require careful consideration and a commitment to responsible innovation.

Market optimism grows as Ripple secures regulatory approval in Dubai. Ripple (XRP) Traders Holding 23% Gains This Week, Despite Volatile Market Trends Ripple (XRP) price surged past the $2.30 mark on Thursday, securing a 23% gain on the weekly timeframe. Despite volatile price action, XRP fluctuated within a 5% range between $2.10 and $2.35 throughout the day. The early US trading session saw a brief rally fueled by softer-than-expected CPI and PPI data, indicating easing inflation. However, by the close of European trading, market sentiment had shifted as escalating US-Canada trade tensions erased earlier gains. Ripple (XRP) Price Action Ripple price dipped another 2% on Thursday, but a closer look at the XRP/USDT weekly price chart suggests that the token has yet to succumb to full bearish control. Trading at $2.34 at press time, XRP remains firmly within its 23% weekly gain range. Bullish momentum surrounding the anticipated approval of XRP ETFs and its potential inclusion in the US strategic crypto reserve has been a major catalyst for sustained buying activity. Many investors who acquired XRP during these key developments have held onto their unrealized profits, signaling confidence in further upside. The reluctance to sell suggests that traders may be waiting for confirmation of ETF approval or funding allocations to the proposed crypto reserve under the Trump administration. Ripple Secures Key Regulatory Approval to Expand Crypto Payment Services in Dubai On Thursday, Ripple Labs, obtained a regulatory license from the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA), granting it the ability to provide crypto payment services to businesses across the region. Obtaining operation license in United Arab Emirate, with a GDP of $277 billion, represents a milestone makes Ripple the first blockchain-powered payment provider to receive DFSA authorization, marking a significant step in its global expansion strategy. “We are thrilled that Ripple is deepening their commitment to Dubai by securing a DFSA license that makes them the first blockchain-enabled payments provider in DIFC,” – Arif Amiri, Chief Executive Officer of DIFC Authority The approval comes amid Ripple’s broader push into international markets, particularly in regions where regulatory clarity is fostering greater institutional adoption. Ripple has reported that approximately 20% of its global user base is located in the Middle East, underscoring the region’s strategic importance. “We are entering an unprecedented period of growth for the crypto industry, driven by greater regulatory clarity around the world and increasing institutional adoption,” – Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse. This latest achievement follows Ripple’s acquisition of Money Transmitter Licenses (MTLs) in regulatory-heavy US states such as New York and Texas, enabling it to expand payment services in those jurisdictions. Ripple now boasts over 50 MTLs in the United States and holds more than 60 licenses worldwide, solidifying its presence as a leading blockchain-powered payments provider. XRP Price Forecast: Bulls Defend $2 as Market Eyes Next Breakout XRP price has held above the critical $2 support level, with technical indicators hinting at a potential bullish continuation. The XRPUSDT weekly chart below shows a sharp rebound from $1.90, marking a 23.53% recovery after a 27.53% correction. This suggests that buyers have re-entered the market, preventing further downside. XRP Price Forecast The Keltner Channel (KC) bands show XRP consolidating within the mid-range, with resistance at $3.32 and support at $2.14. A breakout above the mid-band could confirm a renewed uptrend, while rejection could trigger another retest of lower levels. Parabolic SAR dots remain above the price, indicating lingering bearish pressure, but a flip to the underside could validate bullish momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 54.93, just below the overbought zone of 70.86. This signals room for further upside if buyers sustain pressure. However, failure to reclaim $2.35 resistance could lead to consolidation or renewed selling pressure.

This surge is attributed to growing speculation that Binance will announce a listing of Pi Coin on March 14th, Pi Day. As a result, there has been increased buying pressure as investors anticipate major developments for the cryptocurrency. As Pi Day approaches, keep an eye on developments that could drastically impact Pi’s price and an analyst has explained possible price movements. Potential Scenarios for Pi’s Price Movement Optimistic Outlook: If Pi is listed on Binance, we could see an explosive rally. Pi might break its previous all-time high of $3 and surge to the $4 to $4.50 range within days. If the market sees Pi as a key player in the crypto space, it could even reach $7 to $10 in the short term. Balanced Scenario: A more modest rally could see Pi hit around $3.14 on Pi Day. This would be driven by the excitement of new exchange listings, creating a solid support level for future growth. Cautious Scenario: On the flip side, Pi could face a correction after initial excitement fades. In this case, Pi might only reach around $3 or even fall back to $2. This would reflect a typical crypto market correction. The Unique Appeal of Pi Coin What sets Pi apart from other cryptocurrencies is its community and mobile mining capabilities. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies that require expensive hardware and high energy consumption, Pi allows users to mine using their smartphones, offering an eco-friendly alternative. This unique approach, combined with strong community support, could position Pi as a significant player in the digital currency space. At the time of writing, Pi Coin is down by more than 3% and is trading at $1.67.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,TRADING|EXCHANGE|BNB|ALTCOIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-14 01:31:17

According to CNN , the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) proposes cutting the Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS) workforce by 20%. DOGE plans to slash IRS workforce by 20% in cost-cutting move The cuts are expected to take effect mid-May and would impact an estimated 6,800 government agency employees. According to the latest IRS data, the federal tax collector employs roughly 90,000 workers across the United States. In February, roughly 7,000 probationary IRS employees with one year or less of service were laid off from the organization. However, a recent ruling by U.S. District Judge William Alsup requiring federal agencies to reinstate probationary employees terminated under DOGE’s cost-cutting programs could hinder the planned reviews if it isn’t overturned. Trump pushes tax reform to cut federal debt President Trump has promised comprehensive tax reform in the United States, including potentially eliminating the federal income tax and funding the federal government exclusively through tariffs on foreign goods . The Department of Government Efficiency, helmed by businessman Elon Musk, is considering cutting the $36 trillion U.S. national debt by drastically reducing the size of the federal bureaucracy and instituting aggressive cost-cutting measures. It has some unusual proposals, like putting all public spending on a chain to reduce deficits and increase transparency. At the end of February, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced cutting its regional office directors to comply with the Trump administration’s cost-saving directives. However, under the reorganization plan, the regional offices, which are spread out across major US cities, would stay open, and the SEC recently submitted its 2025 budget proposal to Congress requesting $2.6 billion. President Trump and Elon Musk have discussed allocating 20% of the savings from DOGE’s cost-cutting measures to Americans through stimulus checks or potential tax credits. Meanwhile, research from accounting automation firm Dancing Numbers suggests that Trump’s proposal to eliminate federal income tax could save the average American approximately $134,809 over their lifetime. Moreover, the firm noted that these lifetime tax savings could extend to as much as $325,561 per person if other wage-based taxes at the state level are also repealed. Critics slam DOGE’s federal job cuts and tax plans Still, not everyone is convinced by DOGE’s cost-cutting tactics, including US Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is highly critical of Elon Musk, Trump, and DOGE. At the beginning of the year, the Massachusetts Senator sent a letter to the DOGE proposing increasing taxes and federal spending. The senator argued that these strategies would make the government more efficient. Alongside the planned layoffs, the Trump administration plans to reassign IRS workers to the Department of Homeland Security to support immigration enforcement. In a February letter, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem requested Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to temporarily transfer IRS employees to assist with the ongoing immigration crackdown.

Phase 3 is open and tokens are purchased for $0.02 each. The upcoming Phase 4 will offer MUTM tokens at $0.025 while Phase 3 continues to fill up its capacity which generates excitement for present owners. The market trend reflects overall crypto optimism because Solana (SOL) currently shows signs of recovery after its recent price corrections. The potential of a SOL price reaching $870 is now under analyst investigation while Mutuum Finance’s structured borrowing protocols make MUTM a solid candidate for a future value increase to $3. Mutuum Finance Presale Momentum The continuous influx of buyers is filling Phase 3 of Mutuum Finance ’s presale because investors want to acquire tokens at current prices before future rate adjustments. People who bought MUTM at Phase 2 for $0.015 during December earned 400% profit on their investment before its upcoming $0.06 exchange listing. Each presale phase within Tokenomics implements predetermined pricing accelerations which drives buyers to enter before each increase occurs. Market experts predict that MUTM tokens will reach a valuation of $3 by late 2025 whereas the present token value rests at $0.02 indicating a potential 15,000% increase. The lending features of the platform are leading to continuous buying demand. The protocol uses part of its fees to acquire MUTM tokens from open markets which then get redistributed to stakers and liquidity providers. The features encourage owners to retain MUTM for extended durations while simultaneously decreasing token availability. Every member of Mutuum Finance receives two key advantages: deposit certificates called mtTokens that grow in value over time combined with utility that gives them scarcity value which most popular speculative tokens lack. The initial presale resources go toward forming liquidity pools and ecosystem growth initiatives while making up more than 80% of the budget. Solana’s Race Against Resistance Solana (SOL) seeks to break through crucial resistance zones because network architecture modifications and decentralized finance transactions create an optimistic market environment. The platform has fixed itself in decentralized trading and NFT markets because it operates transactions at speeds of less than 400 milliseconds while costing an average fee of $0.00025. The $260 bull market high needs long-term holder buys and macroeconomic stability before SOL can reach it again. The price target of $870 requires SOL to gain 1,300% of its present value while maintaining trading volume and experiencing general cryptocurrency market expansion. The robust technical foundation of Solana faces short-term limits based on Ethereum layer-2 competition and changing meme coin market dynamics. Mutuum Finance implements a different strategy through its presale-based approach which achieves volatility reduction by establishing fixed tokenomics rules. SOL’s success hinges on external factors like Bitcoin’s performance and regulatory shifts—variables beyond its protocol’s control. Timing the Market’s Next Leap The presale structure at Mutuum Finance provides solid project progress tracking which decentralized projects normally lack. New members of Phase 3 instantly activate cash gains after Phase 4 goes live which proves very rare for crypto ventures at this early development phase. The final phase of the presale price drops to $0.05 immediately before the $0.06 exchange listing allows all participants to earn 20% profit while they benefit from escalated prices following exchange listing. Past DeFi launches based their pricing models on $3 tokens which demonstrated price surges of 500% to 1000% in weeks thereby putting MUTM on track for its price target. The cryptocurrency market intensifies where Mutuum Finance provides dissimilar benefits to Solana regarding risk and reward potential. The market forces affecting SOL result in gradual upwards shifts but MUTM attracts early investors throughout its presale distribution with deflationary token designs that minimize risks and maximize profits. Protocol-developed scarcity drives Phase 3 investors toward its rapidly closing $0.02 price band if they want exponential market gains through available scarcity mechanisms. The predictable growth path of MUTM exceeds other speculative investment strategies.

The token’s current price is a far cry from its 52-week high of $3.38 last January 17th, which was spurred by the industry’s excitement over US President Donald Trump’s reelection.

Gox Sparks Market Jitters Although XRP joins the downtrend of the broader crypto market, a few commentators and analysts expect that Ripple is due for a major rally. According to crypto analyst Egrag Crypto, Ripple’s XRP is set for another price run after it compares the asset’s current Elliot Wave structure with its 2017 fractals. XRP Continues To Weather The Storm Egrag Crypto’s latest price analysis and projection for XRP come as the altcoin and the broader crypto market slump. The Ripple’s coin is holding steady above the critical $2 price support, which suggests it follows the broad five-wave Elliott Wave chart. Traditionally, assets replicating the Elliott Wave structure often incur significant price action. #XRP = Thread (1/7) #XRP: Double Digits This Cycle, Triple Digits Next!

We’ve built together the Full Elliot Wave Count to assess our next Targets: 🎯✨ Take an in-depth look at it! 🔍… pic.twitter.com/NKv00Y5MZD — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) March 12, 2025 Based on Egrag’s assessment, XRP is currently in the second wave of the Elliot Wave structure, which is traditionally defined by high price volatility and corrections. Traders And Investors Must Watch Out For The Larger Wave Structure In a Twitter/X post, Egrag explained that XRP is in its corrective wave two and is primed for a price run to double digits or even over $100. The analysts elaborated that a Wave 2 often retraces a part of Wave 1, usually matching 50%, 76% or even 85.4% of the initial movement. Ripple’s XRP, he shares, is solidifying its hold in the correction phase. The asset faces bearish pressure, and the market can expect a double bottom soon before it moves into its Wave 3. EGRAG warns that Wave 3 is the most aggressive part of the cycle, with more volatility. Can XRP Hit $100 Or More? Previously, XRP’s Wave 1 pattern submitted a huge 733% increase in price. And by using the Elliot Wave extension formula, the popular analyst projects that XRP’s Wave 3 can extend by 1.618x the gain of the first wave. Using this calculation, Egrag offers a potential surge of 1,185x, translating to XRP’s price range between $22 to $24. Once XRP hits the peak of Wave 3, the fourth wave and a price correction follows. For this wage, the retracement level ranges between 14% to 38.2% of Wave 3. If this happens, Egrag predicts that XRP’s price can drop to $8. Related Reading: TRUMP Token Takedown—Did Insiders Plan The Crash? Wave 5 of the Elliot Wave follows, where price can be predicted using three methods. First, if XRP’s price grows between 1.236% and 1.618%, the asset’s price can hit between $32 and $48. Second, if Wave 5 replicates Wave 1, the price can be between $60 and $70. Third, if there’s a 61.8% extension of the movements of Waves 1 and 3, then there’s a chance that XRP’s price can hit $100.

Imagine a scenario where owning a fraction of a luxury condominium or investing in a piece of fine art is as straightforward as a few clicks. This vision is now a reality, thanks to pioneering platforms like Qubetics , Solna, and Arbitrum (ARB). Amidst these developments, Qubetics ($TICS) emerges as the best crypto under a penny, addressing real-life challenges that its predecessors have struggled with. By focusing on the tokenization of real-world assets, Qubetics is perfectly poised to cater to the future needs of blockchain and digital finance, offering solutions that are both practical and forward-thinking. Qubetics: Revolutionizing Real-World Asset Tokenization Qubetics is at the forefront of transforming how we perceive and interact with tangible assets. Its Real-World Asset Tokenization Marketplace allows businesses, professionals, and individuals to convert physical assets—such as real estate, commodities, and intellectual property—into digital tokens on the blockchain. This process not only democratizes access to high-value investments but also introduces liquidity to traditionally illiquid markets. For instance, consider a commercial property valued at $10 million. Traditionally, investing in such an asset would require substantial capital, limiting participation to a select few. With Qubetics, this property can be tokenized into smaller units, enabling a broader audience to invest in portions that align with their financial capacity. This fractional ownership model empowers individuals to diversify their portfolios without the need for significant upfront capital. Qubetics’s crypto presale is in its 25th stage, with each $TICS token priced at $0.1074. The presale has successfully raised over $15 million, attracting more than 22,900 token holders and selling over 499 million $TICS tokens. Projections suggest that $TICS could reach $0.25 after the presale, offering a potential return on investment (ROI) of 133%. Should the token achieve a value of $10 after the mainnet launch, early participants could realize an impressive ROI of 9,207%, cementing itself as the best crypto under a penny. Solana: Pioneering AI Integration Amidst Volatility Solana has been a prominent player in the blockchain arena, renowned for its high throughput and low transaction fees. The platform’s recent endeavors to integrate AI agents signify a strategic move to enhance its ecosystem’s functionality. By enabling AI-driven automation, Solnaa aims to streamline processes such as data analysis, predictive modeling, and intelligent contract execution, thereby attracting a broader spectrum of developers and users. However, this technological advancement coincides with notable price volatility. Solana’s price has experienced significant fluctuations, reaching a high of $131.33 before entering a downtrend. This volatility has raised questions about the sustainability of its recent gains. Additionally, a proposed upgrade has sparked debates within the Solana community regarding potential centralization risks, prompting stakeholders to evaluate the implications to ensure that decentralization principles are upheld. Arbitrum (ARB): Navigating Market Dynamics and Adoption Arbitrum’s ARB token has encountered a challenging period, with its value decreasing by 27.51% over the past month. Despite this downturn, analysts anticipate a potential rebound, forecasting a 30.08% increase to approximately $0.448034 by March 18, 2025. A pivotal event on the horizon is the scheduled token unlock on March 16, 2025, which will release 92.65 million ARB tokens into circulation, equivalent to 2.1% of the existing supply and valued at around $32.60 million. This event could introduce volatility and impact ARB’s market dynamics. In a positive development, the trading platform Robinhood has added support for ARB, resulting in a 13% price surge. This listing enhances ARB’s accessibility to a broader community base, potentially influencing its liquidity and adoption. As Arbitrum continues to navigate these market dynamics, its focus remains on scaling solutions and fostering a robust ecosystem for decentralized applications. Conclusion Blockchain is no longer just about digital currencies—it’s revolutionizing real-world industries in ways that were once unimaginable. Qubetics, Solna, and Arbitrum are leading the charge, each bringing unique innovations that address different challenges in the crypto ecosystem. Qubetics is setting a new standard by tokenizing real-world assets, making high-value investments more accessible and liquid for everyone. Its presale success, raising over $15 million, signals strong interest in its potential. The future of Solna will largely depend on how well it balances decentralization with cutting-edge AI capabilities. Meanwhile, Arbitrum’s market dynamics reflect the unpredictable nature of the crypto industry. For those looking for the best crypto under a penny , Qubetics stands out as a strong contender with real-world applications and a promising presale. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What makes Qubetics different from other cryptocurrencies? Qubetics focuses on tokenizing real-world assets like real estate, commodities, and intellectual property, allowing people to invest in fractions of valuable assets. This brings liquidity to traditionally illiquid markets. Is Solana’s AI integration a game-changer? Solana’s integration of AI agents into its blockchain ecosystem is a significant development. It aims to automate transactions, improve efficiency, and attract developers. However, its price volatility and centralization concerns remain key points of discussion. How will Arbitrum’s token unlock impact its price? Arbitrum’s scheduled token unlock on March 16, 2025, will release 92.65 million ARB tokens, which may introduce volatility. However, recent adoption by Robinhood has positively impacted its market presence.

The drop comes amid large transactions involving wallets linked to FTX and Alameda Research. These moves are believed to be related to the ongoing liquidation of assets for creditor repayments. The timing of these transactions has led to increased bearish sentiment around Solana, adding to its recent price struggles. FTX and Alameda Research Transactions Contribute to Price Decline On March 13, Solana price saw a sharp price pullback, falling by 5% on the day. This decline occurred after a major transfer of Solana tokens from Alameda Research. According to Arkham Intelligence, Alameda unstaked over $23 million worth of SOL, distributing the funds across 38 different addresses. This action followed earlier signs of a sell-off from FTX-linked wallets, fueling concerns about future pressure on the asset’s price. ARKHAM ALERT: ALAMEDA ADDRESS JUST UNSTAKED $23M SOL TO 38 NEW ADDRESSES An FTX/Alameda Staking address received $22.9M SOL from a staking address unlock and has just distributed these funds to 37 addresses that have previously received SOL from this address. These addresses… pic.twitter.com/9eWuKAY4na — Arkham (@arkham) March 12, 2025 The market reaction to these movements was swift with holders becoming wary of the additional supply of SOL entering the market, fearing that further unstaking could lead to more downward price action. Arkham Intelligence pointed out that these wallets have already distributed large amounts of SOL tokens to various addresses, which could increase the available supply on exchanges. This growing sell pressure has created caution among potential buyers. Unstaking History of Solana Assets from FTX FTX’s involvement with Solana goes beyond the March 12 transaction. Since November 2023, FTX and its trading arm, Alameda Research, have unstaked roughly 8 million SOL tokens , valued at nearly $1 billion. Many of these tokens have already been sold through major exchanges like Coinbase and Binance, contributing to the downward trend in Solana’s price. The most notable of these events occurred in early March when FTX unlocked over 3 million SOL tokens, worth approximately $432 million. Despite some positive momentum in the broader market at the time, Solana’s price remained subdued. This lag in performance compared to other altcoins, such as XRP and ADA, has further underscored the pressure placed on Solana by the ongoing liquidation of assets tied to FTX. Potential for Continued SOL Price Weakness As of now, SOL price is still under the influence of FTX’s ongoing liquidation process. Market participants are concerned about the 5.5 million SOL tokens, currently valued at around $693 million, that remain under the control of FTX and Alameda. These assets are still poised to be unstaked or sold, continuing the risk of additional downward pressure on Solana’s price. Despite improving broader market conditions, such as the cooling inflation trend signaled by the latest U.S. CPI and PPI data, Solana’s potential for a price rebound appears limited. As long as these assets remain in the hands of FTX and its affiliates, traders are hesitant to accumulate Solana, fearing further sell-offs. This overhang of potential selling may prevent Solana from regaining its upward momentum in the near term. Solana Price Technical Outlook and Market Sentiment From a technical perspective, Solana’s price action remains under pressure. After briefly reclaiming the $131 mark , the SOL price faced a quick reversal as bearish sentiment took hold. The Solana price has since dipped below the $125 support, which is now viewed as a critical level for future price action. Technical analysis indicates that if Solana price fails to maintain support at these levels, further downside may be expected. Some analysts point to an Elliott Wave pattern suggesting a potential reversal at around $112. As per crypto analysts CryptoUB, this level at $127 has seen multiple rejections, suggesting it could serve as a critical point for both long and short trading strategies. “Above = longs, Below = shorts,” the analyst stated, highlighting that the price consolidation on the 4-hour chart aligns with the daily level, presenting a strong case for a short position. In addition to these technical observations, another market participant, CW8900, mentioned that there is a prominent sell wall around the $180 price point for Solana, but a solid buy wall at the current price range offers support. This setup implies that if Solana price manages to break through the falling wedge pattern and surpass the $180 sell wall, it could potentially revisit its previous high. However, until these technical levels are tested and confirmed, the bearish pressure from ongoing FTX liquidations will likely continue to weigh on the price.

According to a Bloomberg report , Kallas mentioned from the ‘sidelines’ of the Group of Seven meeting in Canada that China is “laughing on the side” over the ongoing tariff issues between the United States and European countries. China is indirectly “benefiting from the US having a trade war with Europe.” Group of Seven meeting in Canada, Source: X, kajakallas Kallas’s statements came hours after US President Donald Trump threatened to enforce 200% taxes on alcoholic drinks like wine and champagne from France or other EU countries. This was Trump’s response to the EU plan to impose tariffs on American whiskey products. The EU retaliated against the US for officially announcing tariffs on steel and aluminum . Regarding the back-and-forth tariff threats, Kallas said that the European Union wants to “keep a cool head” and avoid escalating inflation. However, she emphasized, “Of course, we are ready to act and defend our interest when we need to.” The US stock market faced a three-week major selloff, and the drop continued on Thursday as investors showed concerns about inflation due to the tariff threat. The S&P has reached its lowest in six months, leading to a correction. European-manufactured alcoholic beverages also experienced a decrease in stocks. This included LVMH, the owner of champagne house Moët & Chandon, and Veuve Clicquot, with shares down by 2.2%. Cognac by Remy Cointreau SA fell by 4.5%. Moreover, Pernod Ricard fell by 3.6%. EU’s Kaja Kallas sided with Ukraine after the Trump-Zelenskiy clash Earlier on Thursday, Putin said that he is willing to discuss Ukraine’s ceasefire with the US. However, he warned that any deal should present a long-term war resolution. Kallas responded to Putin’s comments by saying, “We have seen the ceasefires before, and Russia has never kept those agreements.” She implied that it is now up to Moscow to show goodwill. She posted strong comments on social media regarding the recent clash between Trump and Ukraine’s Zelenskiy in the White House. Kallas, who was the former Estonian prime minister, said in her post, “The free world needs a new leader” and “it’s up to us, Europeans, to take this challenge.” Ukraine is Europe! We stand by Ukraine. We will step up our support to Ukraine so that they can continue to fight back the agressor. Today, it became clear that the free world needs a new leader. It’s up to us, Europeans, to take this challenge. — Kaja Kallas (@kajakallas) February 28, 2025 She has stated multiple times that Europe’s involvement in any peace talks between Russia and Ukraine is needed. Kallas faced an unexpected diplomatic challenge when a meeting with U.S. Senator Marco Rubio was canceled at the last minute, officially due to “scheduling issues.” This was a setback in her efforts to strengthen diplomatic ties with the U.S. Despite the fact that a one-on-one meeting couldn’t be possible between the two parties, Kallas said that she had “very positive” interactions with Rubio during meeting breaks. 200% tariffs on EU alcohol will affect wineries in the US Wine sellers and importers believe Trump’s potential tariff will end the European wine market in the U.S. Ronnie Sanders, the CEO of Vine Street Imports in New Jersey, said in an AP News report , “I don’t think customers are prepared to pay two to three times more for their favorite wine or Champagne.” The president of Zachys, a fine wine retailer, Jeff Zacharia, said that 80% of his wine is European. US wine isn’t enough to match the demand; therefore, importers rely on European wines. Zacharia says, “This is just going to have a major negative impact on the whole U.S. wine industry in all aspects of it, including U.S. wineries”. According to IWSR, a global data provider related to alcohol, in 2023, 17% of the wine consumed in the United States was imported from the EU. That percentage makes up 7% of Italy and 5% of French cognac, wine, and vodka. The US Department of Agriculture reported that alcoholic beverages imported into the US during 2022 made up 14% of US agricultural imports worth $26.6 billion. In the same year, the US exported $3.9 billion worth of wine, beer, and distilled spirits. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.
