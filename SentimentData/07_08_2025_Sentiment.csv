Internet Computer protocol price forecast for 2028 expects the token to reach a peak price of $36.8. By 2031, the price of Internet Computer might reach a maximum of $113.32. Internet Computer (ICP) is a groundbreaking blockchain network developed by the DFINITY Foundation. It aims to extend the functionality of the internet, enabling it to host backend software and transforming it into a global, decentralized computer. Internet computer blockchain incorporates advanced cryptography and innovative technology to provide scalable, efficient, and secure decentralized applications (dApps). Given its robust technology and expanding utility, the Internet Computer blockchain‚Äôs future price prospects look promising. As more developers build on the platform and adoption increases, ICP token demand will likely rise. Does Internet Computer coin have a future? How much will Internet Computer coin cost in 2025? Will ICP reach $1000? Let‚Äôs get into the current price analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Internet Computer Token ICP Price $5.12 Market Cap $2.74B Trading Volume $66.21M Circulating Supply 536.26M ICP All-time High $750.73 (May 10, 2021) All-time Low $2.86 (Sep 2023) 24-h High $5.16 24-h Low $4.96 Internet Computer Network technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day period) 5.69% 14-Day RSI 42.80 50-Day SMA $5.29 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 54 (Neutral) Green Days 16/30 (53%) 200-Day SMA $6.09 Internet Computer price analysis TL;DR Breakdown ICP remains bearish despite 1.48% daily gains. OBV shows heavy selling pressure. A break below $5.00 could trigger a cascade toward $4.812. ICP 1-day price analysis The daily chart for August 6 shows ICP trading at $5.122 with a modest +1.48% gain, yet with concerning underlying weakness. The price action remains trapped within the Bollinger Bands, with the upper band at $6.204 acting as strong resistance and the lower band at $4.812 providing support. ICPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD indicator shows both the signal line and MACD line residing in negative territory, while the histogram shows minimal bullish divergence at -0.007, suggesting momentum remains firmly bearish despite today‚Äôs minor uptick. ICP 4-hour price analysis The 4-hour timeframe shows ICP trading below the 20-period SMA at $5.138, which immediately signals short-term bearish pressure. The On Balance Volume plunging to -41.29M exposes significant selling pressure that contradicts any surface-level price stability, while the Balance of Power reading of -0.86 confirms sellers dominate the current market structure. ICPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The recent candlestick formation shows alternating green and red bars with substantial wicks, indicating intense battles between buyers and sellers around the $5.10-$5.15 range, though the bearish OBV suggests money continues flowing out despite these consolidation patterns. ICP technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $5.03 BUY SMA 5 $5.17 SELL SMA 10 $5.34 SELL SMA 21 $5.59 SELL SMA 50 $5.29 SELL SMA 100 $5.35 SELL SMA 200 $6.09 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $5.35 SELL EMA 5 $5.32 SELL EMA 10 $5.25 SELL EMA 21 $5.28 SELL EMA 50 $5.73 SELL EMA 100 $6.69 SELL EMA 200 $7.77 SELL What to expect from ICP price analysis The current market condition points toward further downside pressure, with the immediate target being the lower Bollinger Band at $4.812. Bears maintain control through negative MACD readings and substantial OBV outflows, while bulls struggle to reclaim the 20-day SMA at $5.138. Any break below $5.00 psychological support could trigger accelerated selling toward $4.50, whereas sustained recovery above $5.20 would be needed to invalidate the bearish market. Is Internet Computer a good investment? The Internet Computer (ICP) has shown significant potential and volatility since its launch, which is common for relatively new and ambitious blockchain projects. Its technology aims to decentralize the internet and bring smart contract functionality to the web, which could have wide-ranging implications for the future of web speed. However, the market performance of ICP has been highly volatile, and its success depends heavily on the adoption of its technology and the broader market environment for cryptocurrencies. Please note that before you make an investment decision, seek independent professional consultation. Will Internet Computer reach $25? Yes, Internet Computer ICP might reach and surpass $25 as early as 2027. Will Internet Computer reach $50? Yes, Internet Computer is expected to reach $50. Though the current internet computer sentiment is sideways, future price movements and market cap are expected to be positive. Will ICP reach $1000? Although its ATH sits at $750.73, attaining $1000 in the foreseeable future might be impossible.

49661491,549593,1754521214,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49661491.jpeg,"Ripple Flamed By Caitlin Long: ‚ÄòXRP Is Doomed, Banks Don‚Äôt Trust It‚Äô",https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-flamed-by-caitlin-long-xrp-doomed/,"Caitlin Long, founder and CEO of Custodia Bank, delivered one of the harshest assessments yet of Ripple and the XRP ecosystem in a recent episode of the Gold Goats ‚Äòn Guns podcast, calling into question the project‚Äôs credibility, tokenomics, and long-term viability in institutional finance. In a sweeping critique, Long stated bluntly: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not going to take over. If it were going to take over, it would have taken over a long time ago.‚Äù Caitlin Long Slams Ripple And XRP The conversation began with a reference to growing speculation that Ripple might be among the blockchain networks ‚Äúblessed‚Äù by regulators to handle tokenized financial infrastructure. But Long pushed back hard on that narrative, saying the idea ‚Äúoverstates how important that network is.‚Äù According to Long, the core issue lies in Ripple‚Äôs structural legacy. ‚ÄúThe banks have always been suspicious of it,‚Äù she said, citing what she described as the project‚Äôs centralized architecture and flawed tokenomics. ‚ÄúIt is a centralized network and the tokenomics are backwards.‚Äù She argued that the XRP supply model ‚Äî rooted in a massive pre-mine and upfront fundraising ‚Äî has permanently damaged institutional trust. ‚ÄúThe people who extracted money up front are never going to be trusted because everybody is going to look and think that anything they do is an exit scam to try to dump on retail.‚Äù For Long, the contrast with Bitcoin and Ethereum is stark. ‚ÄúThe most effective tokenization platforms are the ones where there was no money up front or very little money up front,‚Äù she explained. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs Bitcoin and Ethereum.‚Äù Long also interpreted Ripple‚Äôs recent pivot ‚Äî with the company now launching its own regulated stablecoin ‚Äî as a tacit admission of failure. ‚ÄúInstead of trying to sell that into the banking industry, they‚Äôre getting their own regulated financial institutions and trying to issue a stablecoin,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs kind of, in some ways, an admission that the base layer blockchain didn‚Äôt get the adoption they were looking for.‚Äù Her comments come amid Ripple‚Äôs continued push into institutional markets, including efforts to obtain a US bank charter and launch a US dollar stablecoin. While these moves have been celebrated in some circles as signs of maturity and strategic adaptation, Long framed them as a fallback, noting that the original promise ‚Äî to become a foundational layer for interbank settlement ‚Äî had clearly not materialized. ‚ÄúThe base layer network is not going to become the base layer of replacing SWIFT,‚Äù she said. She also pointed to the legal and regulatory drag Ripple faced over the past several years, including the SEC‚Äôs long-running lawsuit against the company for allegedly conducting an unregistered securities offering. ‚ÄúThat hamstrung them,‚Äù she said, while acknowledging that Ripple wasn‚Äôt alone in suffering under the Biden administration‚Äôs broader crackdown on crypto: ‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt hurt Ripple as much as the Fed hurt us‚Ä¶ Everybody who was targeted by the Biden administration was hurt to varying degrees.‚Äù When asked what network the US Treasury is most likely to choose for tokenizing US Treasuries, Long was unequivocal: ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not going to use Ripple. They‚Äôre going to use Ethereum. They may use Bitcoin, but the Bitcoin layer twos are not mature enough for something like that.‚Äù She cited Ethereum‚Äôs technical maturity and infrastructure readiness as the decisive factors. XRP Community Reacts The backlash from the XRP community was swift and furious. Prominent community figure Crypto Eri called the remarks ‚Äúugly tribalism,‚Äù accusing Long of conflating Ripple with the XRP Ledger, and failing to distinguish between a centralized company and a decentralized protocol. ‚ÄúThe entire blockchain community should be deeply disappointed,‚Äù she wrote. Digital Asset Investor, another well-known XRP supporter, tagged Ripple executives directly, suggesting the company was still on track to achieve regulatory breakthroughs. Ashley Prosper went even further, alleging that Long‚Äôs criticism may stem from frustration over Custodia Bank‚Äôs lack of a Federal Reserve master account : ‚ÄúSounds like Caitlin Long is mad that Ripple will get their Fed master account before Custodia Bank.‚Äù But Long‚Äôs criticism was not offhanded nor casual ‚Äî it was pointed and rooted in her long-standing perspective on what makes blockchain infrastructure bank-grade. For her, trust, decentralization, and long-term neutrality are prerequisites ‚Äî and XRP, in her view, fails on all three. ‚ÄúRipple‚Äôs been at this longer than almost anybody else and they haven‚Äôt made a lot of progress,‚Äù Long concluded. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really that simple.‚Äù At press time, XRP traded at $2.94.",XRP|Caitlin Long|ripple|ripple news|XRP news|XRP price,EN,0,0,XRP|FIAT|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-06 23:00:14

Yet sometimes, a project does more than follow market flow; it reshapes it. When talking about the best crypto coins to buy now, it‚Äôs about more than price jumps. It‚Äôs about ongoing development, functional use cases, and a shift in user experience. Here are four crypto coins standing out today, each driving change in unique ways. Leading the charge is BlockDAG, offering a presale experience unlike any other. BlockDAG: Real-Time Trading Dashboard During Presale Rather than just showing high returns, BlockDAG (BDAG) is reworking the entire presale model. Typical presales offer limited access and basic visuals. BlockDAG changes that with an interactive simulator featuring live BDAG/USD charts, a real-time order book, and functioning BUY/SELL tools. This isn‚Äôt a placeholder; it‚Äôs a real trading experience, available even before exchange listings. A standout feature is the wallet-synced interface. Once users buy BDAG, their connected wallet reflects it instantly, mirroring real-time market actions. This level of interaction is almost unheard of in the presale phase and sets a high bar for other projects. BlockDAG‚Äôs performance also speaks volumes. With over $363 million raised and more than 24.7 billion coins sold, the presale is now in batch 29 at $0.0016. The price holds until August 11th. Early buyers have already seen 2,660% growth in their funds since batch 1, proving its strength. BlockDAG continues to shape presale strategies, making it one of the best crypto coins to buy now. Bittensor: Real AI Applications on the Blockchain Bittensor earns its place by blending AI and decentralization with actual function. Unlike projects built on hype, Bittensor runs a system where AI models operate in an open framework and earn rewards in TAO tokens. These rewards are based on processing power, not social chatter. That core design aligns price and performance more naturally than many speculative plays. Contributors provide computing output and are rewarded directly, reinforcing measurable outcomes. As demand for AI-based systems grows, Bittensor keeps proving its relevance. Its long-term appeal is tied to a strong use case. With few serious rivals in the decentralized AI space, Bittensor remains one of the best crypto coins to buy now for those who believe in utility-based growth. Ethereum: Evolving Infrastructure and Steady Strength Ethereum remains a major force in crypto, not because of short-term spikes, but due to its foundation in real-world applications. As the go-to smart contract platform, Ethereum dominates DeFi, NFTs, and the rollup-driven Layer 2 ecosystem. Recent efforts to improve scaling and reduce gas fees through rollups show the network‚Äôs forward momentum. Its growth doesn‚Äôt rest on novelty, but on a steady expansion of tools, adoption, and developer output. Interest from institutions remains consistent. With staking, ETFs, and multiple ecosystem updates, Ethereum holds its place as one of the best crypto coins to buy now, showing how a well-established network can continue setting new standards for others. XRP: Strong Base Backed by Legal Clarity and Utility XRP continues to gain strength due to clearer regulatory standing and increasing real-world use. After positive developments in its legal matters, XRP‚Äôs value is now more tied to activity than speculation. Ripple‚Äôs efforts in Asia and the Middle East highlight XRP‚Äôs real use in cross-border payments. Large banks testing the system for transactions show there is consistent demand grounded in actual utility. Though news events still move the price, XRP‚Äôs current position is more solid than in past cycles. For those watching utility-led growth, XRP stands out as one of the best crypto coins to buy now. Final Thoughts! Focusing only on price charts won‚Äôt give the full story when deciding the best crypto coins to buy now . What matters is which projects are reshaping how people engage with digital assets. BlockDAG stands out by offering a pre-listening trading experience that other presales don‚Äôt provide. Bittensor shows real progress in decentralized AI. Ethereum continues to strengthen its base, while XRP pushes ahead with clarity and purpose. Together, these projects show that true performance is more than just price; it‚Äôs how they redefine expectations and deliver value.

No influencer push. No meme-fueled chaos. Just a smart idea, clean tokenomics, and the kind of product that doesn‚Äôt need overexplaining. And it‚Äôs catching on fast. While many presales drown in buzzwords or recycled hype, DeSoc is building something that speaks to a wider audience of creators, users, and investors who are tired of platforms taking everything while offering almost nothing in return. DeSoc isn‚Äôt trying to replace social media. It‚Äôs trying to fix the part that matters: ownership. With a working DeFi model that connects directly to major platforms like Instagram, TikTok, X, and Facebook, the project is gaining momentum for reasons that go beyond price speculation. It‚Äôs the latest viral craze, not because it‚Äôs loud, but because it makes sense. This Isn‚Äôt Just a Crypto Presale . It‚Äôs a Product People Actually Want DeSoc is being built as a decentralized content platform that allows creators to publish once and syndicate everywhere. Through its API integrations, a user can post on DeSoc and have their content show up across their other social accounts automatically. But the real difference is what happens behind the scenes. Every post, interaction, or tip is stored immutably on-chain. That means full transparency, clear audit trails, and a creator-first model that cuts out the middlemen. In short, it‚Äôs decentralized finance applied to the internet‚Äôs social layer. It‚Äôs not about hype. It‚Äôs about giving people the tools to own what they create and to get rewarded for it directly. Tokenomics that Makes absolute Sense A lot of crypto presales throw together tokenomics as an afterthought. DeSoc took the opposite approach. Of its 3 billion $SOCS tokens, 45% are allocated to the presale. That‚Äôs not just a liquidity move, it‚Äôs a signal to early users that they‚Äôre part of something foundational. Another 20% is set aside for development. Five percent of that goes to the team, with a two-year lock-in in place. 15% goes to the marketing team, community rewards get 10%, and 10% is reserved for liquidity. There‚Äôs also a 30-year liquidity lock, one of the longest commitments we‚Äôve seen in the space. Real Monetization, Real Use Cases, Real Incentives Here‚Äôs where DeSoc really stands apart. This DeFi platform lets creators earn through tipping, content gating, subscriptions, and micropayments. Premium content? Pay to unlock it. Want to promote a post? Use your $SOCS tokens . It‚Äôs simple, direct, and designed to make engagement valuable. You can also use tokens for peer-to-peer payments, in-app purchases, and even support charitable causes or creators directly. Think of it as decentralized finance built into everyday social activity, without the jargon or the barrier to entry. The creator economy has been waiting for something like this. Now that it‚Äôs here, it‚Äôs no surprise people are piling in. Community-Driven, Governance-Ready DeSoc isn‚Äôt a token you just hold and forget. Governance is built into the platform. Token holders can submit proposals, vote on platform upgrades, and help shape reward systems and future features. Everything is executed through smart contracts, with options for quadratic voting to ensure more balanced outcomes. The idea is to move beyond passive token holding and into actual decision-making, something crypto presale buyers rarely get to be part of. It‚Äôs transparent, it‚Äôs participatory, and it gives users a voice from the start. The $10 Million Milestone? That‚Äôs just the Beginning! Plenty of projects raise big numbers. Few do it with this much clarity. DeSoc‚Äôs $10 million haul didn‚Äôt happen because of luck or noise. It happened because the pitch is clear, the product is working, and the timing is right. As more creators look to break free from platform dependency and as users demand more control over what they see and share, DeSoc lands in the perfect spot. It‚Äôs not just a platform. It‚Äôs a model for how decentralized finance can actually support real people doing real things online. And right now, it‚Äôs still early. Each presale stage offers slightly higher pricing, rewarding those who move first but keeping access open to new buyers who see the long-term vision. Conclusion DeSoc didn‚Äôt go viral by accident. It offered something that felt fresh and backed it up. It‚Äôs the kind of crypto presale that gives the space a better name. No pump-and-dump. No smoke and mirrors. Just product, people, and progress. DeSoc is quietly showing what happens when you build for value, not just volume. With more funding pouring in and features rolling out, this latest viral craze might end up being one of the smartest early-stage moves in decentralized finance right now.

Whales Are Bailing, Retail‚Äôs Late",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-bull-run-already-over-whales-bailing/,"CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn used today‚Äôs price weakness to publish a granular, 10-part ‚ÄúBitcoin Market Analysis‚Äù on X that dissects the post-ATH landscape with on-chain detail and a clear technical line in the sand. ‚ÄúBitcoin broke its all-time high, but here‚Äôs the catch: long-term holders are [starting] to sell into the strength,‚Äù he wrote, adding that what matters now is how the market digests that supply above and around the breakout zone. In his framing, the first stress test is underway. Is The Bitcoin Bull Run Over? The thread anchors around one headline-grabbing datapoint: ‚Äúthe LTH selling pressure includes the 80,000 BTC sold by the Satoshi-era wallet.‚Äù That description is Maartunn‚Äôs interpretation of July‚Äôs extraordinary movement of eight ‚Äúancient‚Äù wallets that shifted roughly 80,000 BTC after ~14 years of dormancy via Galaxy Digital. Beyond the drama of this single entity, Maartunn argues that behavior across the holder spectrum is what‚Äôs driving the tape. ‚ÄúRetail is stepping in after the ATH,‚Äù he noted, describing a familiar pattern of late-cycle enthusiasm that followed Bitcoin‚Äôs push through $120,000 in mid-July. That surge set a new record near $123,000 before momentum faded; spot prices are now revolving around $113,000‚Äì$115,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Secretly Tracking This Market Signal: Weiss Crypto The bid didn‚Äôt vanish entirely. ‚ÄúFresh capital did help the ATH-breakout buyers,‚Äù Maartunn wrote, pointing to balance-sheet demand ‚Äúfrom firms like Strategy and Metaplanet.‚Äù Those purchases are verifiable. Strategy‚Äîthe rebranded MicroStrategy‚Äîdisclosed 21,021 BTC bought between July 28 and Aug. 3 at an average of ~$117,256, lifting its holdings to ~628,791 BTC. Tokyo-listed Metaplanet added 463 BTC on Aug. 4, taking treasury holdings to 17,595 BTC. Even so, those corporate flows ‚Äúweren‚Äôt enough to hold Bitcoin around the ~$120k level,‚Äù the analyst said. Where the thread turns more cautionary is on short-term hands. ‚ÄúShort-Term Holders started to puke and sell at a loss,‚Äù Maartunn wrote, quantifying realized-loss waves of 52,230 BTC (July 15‚Äì18), 42,493 BTC (July 24‚Äì28), and 70,028 BTC ‚Äúafter July 31.‚Äù He called the last episode notable ‚Äúnot just [for] the size, but the duration,‚Äù arguing that prolonged STH loss-realization is a pressure valve that typically needs time to exhaust. These are Maartunn‚Äôs on-chain tallies; they have not been separately published by data vendors in aggregate form. The flows picture from listed products has begun to rhyme with that stress. ‚ÄúETFs are also seeing outflows,‚Äù he observed. Multiple trackers confirm a downswing: CoinShares logged the first net weekly outflow in 15 weeks (-$223 million) with Bitcoin funds leading at -$404 million, while daily tallies this week show US spot Bitcoin ETFs bleeding for several sessions, including about -$196 million on Tuesday. Framing differs by window, but the direction is clear: the bid from ETFs is wobbling at the margin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Risks Another Crash Following Recovering Into Bearish FVG Zone Technically, Maartunn fixes attention on the former breakout zone. ‚ÄúBitcoin is finding support around its previous ATH ‚Äî roughly $112K,‚Äù he wrote, pointing to a confluence between chart structure and on-chain price-distribution. His on-chain map ‚Äúbacks it up,‚Äù flagging ‚Äústrong support in the $108K‚Äì$112K range,‚Äù an area where a large volume of coins last changed hands. Context matters. Bitcoin‚Äôs July all-time high sits around $123,000 on major benchmarks‚Äîan extension of 2025‚Äôs institutional-heavy advance‚Äîso calling $112,000 a ‚Äúprevious ATH‚Äù refers to the nearer-term breakout plateau that preceded price discovery, not the absolute record. That nuance is why Maartunn concludes with a conditional: ‚ÄúSo far this cycle, we haven‚Äôt seen any previous ATH break down‚Ä¶ Until that changes, this looks like a normal pullback. But if we do break below a former ATH ($112k), that‚Äôs a real shift in market behavior.‚Äù In the near term, the credibility of that ~$108,000‚Äì$112,000 ‚Äúshelf‚Äù will likely be decided by whether supply from profit-taking long-term holders, loss-realizing short-term holders, and ETF redemptions continues to outweigh balance-sheet demand and organic spot inflows. If the shelf holds, Maartunn‚Äôs base case is ‚Äúa normal pullback‚Äù that bleeds off excesses from the ATH push. If it fails decisively, he argues, the cycle would be showing its first meaningful breach of a prior breakout‚Äîan observable change in behavior rather than a narrative turn of phrase.

49663786,550043,1754521257,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49663786.jpeg,Ethereum Under Trump: Exploring 3 Pathways For Impact From New Crypto Policies,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-under-trump-exploring-3-pathways/,"In a recent analysis by The Motley Fool, a private financial and investing advice company based in the US, the implications of President Donald Trump‚Äôs support for the cryptocurrency sector have come under scrutiny, particularly regarding Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Trump has consistently advocated for the crypto industry, surrounding himself with pro-crypto advisors and advancing initiatives such as the establishment of a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. His administration is actively promoting legislation that would establish the United States as a global leader in cryptocurrency. The recent passage of the GENIUS Act , which establishes stablecoins as the foundation of this ongoing change in the country‚Äôs digital asset ecosystem, is a key part of this effort. Trump‚Äôs Crypto Roadmap One significant aspect of Trump‚Äôs crypto policy roadmap is the effort to clarify regulatory frameworks. The lack of clear regulations has long been a concern for businesses and financial institutions operating in the crypto space. Uncertainty about regulatory oversight has led to apprehension regarding enforcement actions, with many stakeholders worried about engaging with the sector. The current administration aims to eliminate these ambiguities by proposing legislation that would assign the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) oversight of the cryptocurrency spot market . This shift would alleviate concerns that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might assert jurisdiction, imposing stringent securities regulations on crypto companies. Recently, the House of Representatives passed the Clarity Act, which seeks to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework, though it still requires Senate approval. Ethereum At The Forefront Another key element of Trump‚Äôs roadmap is the integration of decentralized finance (DeFi) into traditional financial systems. The administration is advocating for legislative measures that recognize the potential of DeFi technologies, which rely on decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. Ethereum‚Äôs blockchain is at the forefront of this movement, according to the firm‚Äôs analysis, serving as the primary platform for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Smart contracts automate various processes, executing agreements when specific conditions are met. For instance, in real estate, a smart contract could streamline mortgage transactions by automatically executing terms once necessary documentation and payments are provided. With over half of all decentralized applications operating on the Ethereum blockchain , an expansion of decentralized finance could significantly boost the use and adoption of Ethereum itself. Additionally, the administration is focusing on stablecoins, a crucial area within the cryptocurrency landscape. Recently signed into law, the GENIUS Act aims to establish a regulatory framework for the integration of stablecoins into broader payment systems. Their appeal lies in the ability to use US Treasury securities as a reserve pool, potentially increasing demand for Treasuries and aiding in the management of national debt. The White House‚Äôs fact sheet emphasizes that the widespread adoption of dollar-backed stablecoins could modernize payment infrastructure, moving the US away from outdated systems. Notably, a substantial portion of stablecoin transactions, especially from leading stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC), occur on the Ethereum network, highlighting its central role in the ecosystem.

DeSoc Launches Viral Presale As Solana and Dogecoin Investors Pile In,https://thecoinrise.com/is-this-the-future-of-social-media-desoc-launches-viral-presale-as-solana-and-dogecoin-investors-pile-in/,"A new wave of investor interest is emerging around DeSoc , a blockchain-based social media platform that is shaking up the status quo with its innovative viral presale. As crypto users seek more meaningful use cases and fresh narratives beyond the usual DeFi cycles, DeSoc‚Äôs approach is striking a chord, especially with investors coming from Solana and Dogecoin. The project isn‚Äôt just another token launch. It‚Äôs setting up the groundwork for a full-on decentralized social media ecosystem, combining content monetization, microtransactions, and governance into one system, all powered by the $SOCS token. At just $0.01 per token and with 12 presale stages, early adopters are getting a first look at what some believe could become crypto‚Äôs answer to Instagram and Twitter. DeSoc: Content Meets Crypto Utility DeSoc‚Äôs real value lies in how it blends familiar social media behavior with tokenized incentives. Through content syndication, users can publish posts directly on DeSoc and have them appear across various platforms, including Instagram, Facebook, X, and TikTok. That cross-platform presence keeps creators visible while giving them token-based rewards for quality content, engagement, or exclusive posts. The platform introduces a reward system for content creators, tipping tools, premium subscriptions, and even micropayments for unlocking certain posts. Users can promote content, donate to causes, and engage in peer-to-peer transactions, all using $SOCS. DeSoc also features tokenized governance, smart contracts for proposal execution, and a transparent API system for seamless integration with existing social networks. The tokenomics support this vision: 45% of the total 3 billion supply is allocated to the new viral presale , 20% reserved for development, 15% for marketing, and 10% each for liquidity and community rewards. Solana‚Äôs Growth Story vs. DeSoc‚Äôs Value Proposition Solana has been on a run. The price recently touched $200 before pulling back to around $181, reflecting a 50% rally over the past month. Its ETF debut raised $100 million in just 12 days , and MetaMask‚Äôs new support for Solana adds another layer of accessibility. On the DeFi side, Solana‚Äôs total value locked is closing in on $10 billion, overtaking BNB in some key areas. Still, the surge hasn‚Äôt gone unnoticed by traders looking for entry points or exit ramps. A common concern is whether Solana‚Äôs price action is sustainable at these highs or whether capital could rotate into lower-cap, utility-driven projects like DeSoc. While Solana‚Äôs ecosystem continues expanding, it largely caters to developers and large-scale projects. By contrast, DeSoc appeals directly to everyday users, creators, and community builders. Dogecoin‚Äôs Latest Updates Spark New Interest Don‚Äôt count Dogecoin out just yet. According to recent chart analysis, DOGE is retesting the neckline of a double bottom formation , typically a bullish pattern. It recently reached a local high of $0.288 before correcting and is now hovering around $0.2388. Buyers are watching closely, with support near $0.235 holding strong. Dogecoin‚Äôs latest updates also highlight a larger truth about the token it still boasts one of the most passionate communities in the crypto space. But while it thrives on memes and culture, it‚Äôs limited in what users can actually do with it. DeSoc, by contrast, offers that same community-driven vibe but adds something Dogecoin lacks: utility. Dogecoin traders seeking the next wave may find DeSoc‚Äôs new viral presale to be a more functional pivot one that still values the community, but also empowers it. The New Viral Presale Worth Your Money Between Dogecoin‚Äôs latest updates and Solana‚Äôs recent price action, it‚Äôs clear the crypto market isn‚Äôt short on excitement. But if the goal is long-term returns rooted in adoption and utility, DeSoc‚Äôs new viral presale stands out. It offers a rare combination: creator monetization, decentralized governance, cross-platform functionality, and user-first economics. If you‚Äôre tired of speculating and want a chance to get in on something with real-world traction, $SOCS may be your best bet this year. The early presale is now live, but at $0.01, it may not remain that low for long. Discover the future of decentralized social infrastructure with DeSoc.

At the time of writing, DOGE is trading around $0.2035, showing signs of consolidation after a turbulent few months. The current setup has some analysts predicting a potential breakout, especially if capital continues rotating out of large caps like Bitcoin and Ethereum and into more speculative assets. Emerging altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE have also entered the conversation. With momentum mirroring early-stage success stories like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, the project is attracting investors hoping to secure ground-floor positions before potential exchange listings. Solana‚Äôs Capital Rotation Could Trigger DOGE Rally One of the major forces pushing attention back toward Dogecoin is the recent rotation of liquidity within the altcoin space. As seen with Solana‚Äôs sharp rise and subsequent pullback, traders are clearly reallocating funds based on short-term momentum and long-term narratives. DOGE, still one of the most recognizable cryptocurrencies globally, is benefiting from this environment. If current trends continue and investor appetite grows during the next altcoin cycle, some price forecasts suggest DOGE could aim for $0.50‚Äì$1.00 by 2026‚Äîespecially if market sentiment remains strong and retail participation increases. Why Investors Are Watching This New Altcoin Closely While meme coins like Dogecoin have historically offered explosive upside, the real buzz is now shifting toward MAGACOIN FINANCE. The project has been gaining massive traction thanks to its limited presale access and strong community backing. Traders are now speculating MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver a 38x gains , potentially outperforming legacy meme coins during the next rally. What‚Äôs drawing comparisons to Solana‚Äôs early days is its rapidly growing ecosystem and timed market entry‚Äîright as capital is flowing potentially high-reward assets. What Could Fuel DOGE‚Äôs Next Big Move Several factors could set the stage for a new Dogecoin rally: Retail-driven momentum: DOGE remains a favorite among social media traders and retail investors. Celebrity attention: Any renewed buzz from high-profile figures could reignite interest. Altcoin cycle timing: The next market-wide rally could shift capital into high-volatility assets like DOGE. Exchange upgrades and adoption: Increased integration and use cases could boost long-term value. Whale accumulation: If larger holders return, it could signal a stronger bullish trend ahead. Could DOGE Hit $1? While reaching $1 would require a significant rally, it‚Äôs not entirely out of the question‚Äîespecially if Dogecoin captures enough momentum during the next altcoin season. That said, the market is evolving, and many investors are now looking beyond traditional meme coins. The growing attention around MAGACOIN FINANCE, especially with projections of 38x returns , underscores how investor behavior is shifting toward newer, faster-moving opportunities.

Analysts now have their eyes on three top-notch projects that offer more than hype: Avalanche (AVAX), Solana (SOL), and DeSoc (SOCS) . Each of these altcoins brings something unique to the table, be it super-fast smart contracts, a growing dApp ecosystem, or going big on decentralized social infrastructure. With real-world utility, developer adoption, and growing communities backing them, these altcoins are being described as the top cryptos to invest in now by retail and institutional voices alike. Let‚Äôs dive into the numbers and why these three are causing a splash in 2025. AVAX has Resisted Despite the Price Drop Avalanche , at other times praised for its speed and scalability, now trades at $23.39, down by 6.45% over the last 24 hours. Its market cap is $9.87 billion, trading volume of $890.5 million, which went down somewhat by 1.62%. Despite this fall, AVAX is still a force to be reckoned with in the smart contract arena. The subnet architecture of the protocol allows developers to deploy extremely flexible blockchains tailored for specific applications, from gaming to DeFi. With institutional buying picking up steam and consistent updates on the roadmap, Avalanche is still a low-gas-fee cryptocurrency with long-term prospects. Solana‚Äôs Strength Keeps It In The Top Tier Solana (SOL) , the erstwhile ‚ÄúEthereum killer,‚Äù was trading at $184.52, a 6.79% dip in the last twenty-four hours. Its market cap is still at $99.48 billion, with trading volume showing a 14.1% increase to now at $11.49 billion. SOL remains standing tall for its extremely fast transaction times and ridiculously low fees and is quickly becoming the chain of choice for NFT portals, GameFi platforms, and scalable DeFi applications. The recent drop is regarded by analysts as a much-needed correction and not something to be worried about, especially as Solana-based projects continue to go strong. Still, for those who are looking for the next 100x crypto, there are others peering elsewhere to a new star by the name of DeSoc. DeSoc: The Viral Social Layer Web3 Desperately Needs While AVAX and Solana are scaling transactions, DeSoc is scaling something arguably much bigger: social identity and reputation across the decentralized web. DeSoc (Decentralized Social) fuels a unified identity layer for Web2 and Web3. From Farcaster to Twitter and Lens, the SOCS token enables users and devs to sync identity, build trust, and monetize influence across platforms. The SOCS token is now in presale, but it‚Äôs already made waves with over $10 million raised in just over a week, with pundits calling it the best altcoin to buy today for those planning ahead for 2025. What‚Äôs behind the DeSoc buzz? Decentralized identity across numerous platforms SOCS token used for staking and voting APIs for creating social tools that developers will love Reputation tracking and monetization of content Over $10 million raised, and early-bird rewards are live Whereas AVAX and Solana are taking care of the infrastructure needs at the base level, DeSoc is targeting what is missing: the people layer. In a global ecosystem where developers, influencers, and creators survive on social identity and trust, DeSoc can be the glue that holds the Web3 world together. Final Take: Balance The Present With The Future AVAX and Solana have already proven themselves, delivering reliability and scale to Web3 today. But if you want to know where the next wave of growth and innovation will arrive from, DeSoc has a compelling case. Its social-first design takes advantage of one of Web3‚Äôs most valuable assets: reputation. Add to this its developer-focused stack and user demand accelerating at an alarming speed, and it‚Äôs little wonder that SOCS tokens are vanishing fast from presale.

49662610,https://timestabloid.com/?p=77161,1754523037,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP Price Outlook if It Captures 10% of Global Real Estate Transactions,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-price-outlook-if-it-captures-10-of-global-real-estate-transactions/,"XRP is currently trading at $3.00 with a market capitalization of approximately $177.9 billion. Despite recent market fluctuations, the token has recorded a 38% increase in value this year and a notable 480% surge since November 2024. Even with this significant upward trend, several market analysts continue to suggest that XRP‚Äôs current valuation does not fully reflect its potential. A key argument supporting this view is the increasing adoption of XRP as a bridge currency for global payments. One area where this function could be expanded is the real estate sector, particularly in facilitating cross-border property transactions. As international property sales continue to grow, the question arises: What could XRP be worth if it became a key settlement tool in this domain? Global Real Estate Volume and XRP‚Äôs Hypothetical Role In 2024, the global real estate market, encompassing both residential and commercial transactions, reached a total volume of $703 billion , representing a 14% year-over-year increase. Of this, the Americas accounted for $372 billion, while the EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) region recorded $199 billion. The Asia-Pacific region contributed $131 billion. Activity intensified in the fourth quarter of the year, during which deal volume alone reached $232 billion. In a hypothetical model, if XRP were to facilitate the entirety of these cross-border property transactions, it would need to function as both a transactional intermediary and a temporary store of value. In this scenario, financial institutions, real estate firms, and investors would rely on XRP to enhance the speed and efficiency of international settlements. This would require deep liquidity and sustained demand, likely leading to upward pressure on its market value. Projected Valuations Based on Market Integration To estimate XRP‚Äôs potential price in this hypothetical context, a capital multiplier model was applied. In crypto markets, the market cap of an asset can expand significantly beyond the nominal capital inflow due to increased demand and limited supply. Multiplier effects typically range from 5x to 15x but may rise further in highly bullish market conditions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A multiplier of 10x was applied to the $703 billion in global real estate transactions, resulting in a projected market capitalization of $7.03 trillion for XRP. Given its current circulating supply of 59.3 billion tokens, this scenario implies a token price of approximately $118.55. For a more conservative estimate, a 5x multiplier was also considered. Under this model, the projected market cap would be $3.515 trillion, leading to a token price of $59.3. Even in this restrained case, XRP‚Äôs price would increase almost twentyfold from its current value. While it is unlikely that XRP will fully dominate the global real estate transaction landscape in the near term, partial adoption could still have a meaningful impact on its valuation. Should XRP capture even 5% to 10% of the annual global property transaction volume, its value could reasonably increase to a range between $6 and $12. This analysis presents a speculative but data-driven assessment of how XRP‚Äôs utility could extend beyond traditional financial remittances into larger and more complex sectors such as real estate. Although full integration remains hypothetical, the potential for growth underscores XRP‚Äôs relevance in broader financial infrastructure.

As meme coins blow up and Layer 1s struggle with congestion wars, there‚Äôs one project that‚Äôs rewriting the playbook quietly, and investors are snapping up on it fast. Say hello to DeSoc , the decentralized social identity platform that has already hit over $10 million in weeks, one of the best crypto presales to invest in today. Backed by a solid use case, expert credibility, and a growing base of believers, DeSoc is not just a coin. It‚Äôs the connective tissue Web3 has lacked. What Is DeSoc and Why Is It Booming? Short for ‚ÄúDecentralized Social,‚Äù DeSoc is solving one of crypto‚Äôs most important problems: fractured identity. Today, your identity on X (Twitter), Farcaster, Discord, or Lens exists in separate silos. DeSoc tackles that by unifying identity, social credibility, and influence across Web2 and Web3. Developed with creators, developers, and communities in mind, the SOCS token is for staking, governance, and powering the tools that make decentralized reputation possible. Here‚Äôs why analysts are so hot on it: One Identity Layer for Web2 and Web3 Developer APIs to build social tools and platforms Staking rewards and governance are built in Creator monetization through social reputation metrics Raised over $10M, with a presale that‚Äôs red hot in seconds If you slept on early Ethereum or Solana, DeSoc might be your second chance at a high-utility gem before it becomes mainstream. Experts Say It Ticks All The Right Boxes Analysts are already referring to DeSoc as one of the next 100x crypto projects, and rightly so. It sits at the intersection of multiple popular narratives: decentralized identity, social finance (SoFi), creator tools, and Web3 reputation. Even better? It‚Äôs live and currently under construction, not just a roadmap fantasy. In a space that‚Äôs too rich in speculation, DeSoc brings actual use-case utility: Synchronize identity across platforms Boost trust with on-chain reputation Developers can build using friendly APIs Token utility includes staking, governance, and creator rewards Growing quickly with smart early adopters $10 Million Raised and Growing DeSoc‚Äôs presale is blazing. Collecting well over $10 million in just weeks, early investors are racing to buy tokens before the next price level. The team also hinted at a series of high-profile partnerships, alongside an imminent testnet integration and dApp builder tools, which could open the door to thousands of apps supported by DeSoc‚Äôs identity platform. Early adopters get limited-time perks, so the timing is ideal to join now. Why DeSoc Trounces Other Presales Let‚Äôs be real, most presales these days are either memecoin or mysterious whitepaper hype. DeSoc isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs founded on Web3‚Äôs biggest requirement: verifiable identity and trust. It‚Äôs not a token with ambitions of being the next Dogecoin. It‚Äôs infrastructure. It‚Äôs designed for a purpose. It‚Äôs what Web3 has been missing. With the SOCS token powering the whole platform, early adopters are poised to ride along as growth persists, and in light of the $10 Million+ having been raised, it seems that they won‚Äôt be riding solo. Final Thought: Get In While It‚Äôs Early The presale window is still open, but it won‚Äôt be around forever. With its strong foundations, growing developer interest, and clearly articulated roadmap, DeSoc is quickly becoming the savvy investor‚Äôs best option for long-term returns.

49663028,https://thecoinrise.com/xrp-news-today-ripple-drops-below-3-as-investors-show-interest-in-new-defi-social-media-platform/,1754523611,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/49663028.jpeg,XRP News Today: Ripple Drops Below $3 As Investors Show Interest In New DeFi Social Media Platform,https://thecoinrise.com/xrp-news-today-ripple-drops-below-3-as-investors-show-interest-in-new-defi-social-media-platform/,"XRP has been a constant in the crypto universe for quite some time, with praise for its application in cross-border payments and victory in court over the SEC. Yet even traditional tokens are not exempt from investor mood swings. As of now, XRP has dipped below $3 , now selling at $3.10, a decline of 9.92%, though it recorded an astronomical 146.97% increase in day-to-day trading volume to more than $17.19 billion. So what‚Äôs going on? Yes, part of the decline can be attributed to profit-taking and market fluctuation, but there‚Äôs another trend in play too: investors relocating capital into fresh opportunities, namely, into next-gen DeFi social platforms like DeSoc . What‚Äôs Driven XRP‚Äôs Decline Despite Ripple‚Äôs persistent existence and real-world implementations, XRP has not been immune to overall sell-offs. The recent drop below the psychological $3 level is suspect considering the surge in trading volume, which typically signals either whale activity or bulk redemptions. Analysts suggest the following could be at play: Profit-taking following XRP‚Äôs recent rally over $3.30 Soliciting investor interest in more revolutionary altcoins Rotation within the market from old-school tokens to presale-stage ventures FOMO in new spaces such as decentralized identity and DeFi social This is not necessarily terrible news for XRP long-term, but short-term sentiment very much indicates retail and early adopters are searching for the next breakout. DeSoc: The Web3 Social Layer That‚Äôs Turning Heads Whereas XRP stumbles under the pressure of price, a new challenger is stepping into the limelight. DeSoc Decentralized Social is becoming the Web3 identity layer, uniting users on social platforms, chains, and communities. It‚Äôs a purpose-built project for the post-X (Twitter) world, where decentralized influence, on-chain trust, and creator ownership are more critical than ever. And the stats don‚Äôt lie: Raised over $10 million in its current presale SOCS token facilitates governance, staking, and developer functions Massive adoption by developers, influencers, and Web3 creators Cross-platform identity mapping from Web2 to Web3 Reputation rewards, not speculation In a nutshell, DeSoc is social media reimagined for crypto, and interest is high. Why Investors Are Flocking to DeSoc The crypto world is no longer satisfied with passive investment. What they are looking for now is utility, community, and upside potential, and DeSoc delivers all three. Here‚Äôs how it‚Äôs grabbing attention: Cross-chain social identity on dApps, DAOs, and Web2 Creator economy with reputation-based incentives Developer-friendly APIs for building new dApps and social tools SOCS staking with passive income and governance impact Staggering early traction with over $10M raised For investors who missed out early on Solana or Arbitrum, DeSoc is a do-over, better vision to boot. From XRP to DeSoc: Is This a Strategic Shift? Not only are XRP holders selling, but they‚Äôre strategically moving into altcoins with a definite roadmap and strong user base demand. DeSoc is not competing with Ripple‚Äôs payment rails, but it‚Äôs fixing a larger problem in the crypto ecosystem: Who do you trust online and how do you prove it? By offering portable digital identities that contain social trust and sway, DeSoc becomes infrastructure for Web3, and not just a token. Last Take: Is Time to Diversify? XRP is not going away. But its recent decline shows even top-shelf cryptos need more than hype to sustain the momentum. Conversely, DeSoc is offering something XRP can‚Äôt: an entirely new utility layer for the decentralized internet. As the presale continues to gain traction, early investors are locking in before the next wave of growth. If you‚Äôre exploring high-utility altcoins and want exposure to the growing DeFi + Social intersection, DeSoc may just be your smartest next move.

49663628,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=780683,1754524023,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/49663628.jpeg,Tim Cook joins Trump at White House for Apple investment announcement,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/apple-pledges-100b-for-us-manufacturing/,"Apple is adding $100 billion to its U.S. manufacturing plans following a closed-door meeting between Tim Cook and President Donald Trump at the White House on Wednesday. This comes as the company tries to protect its core product line from a new wave of tariffs and stay on the administration‚Äôs good side while still depending heavily on overseas factories. Trump is expected to personally announce Apple‚Äôs new pledge at the White House event where Cook will also be present. The plan involves setting up a new domestic manufacturing program to pull more of the company‚Äôs supply chain into the U.S. This includes building and assembling more critical components locally to avoid new trade penalties. It adds to Apple‚Äôs earlier promise of $500 billion, which covered projects like a server manufacturing site in Houston, a supplier training center in Michigan, and more money flowing to existing American vendors. With this new pledge, Apple‚Äôs total investment in the U.S. now stands at $600 billion. Trump raises tariffs while Apple tries to hold ground White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers tied the new investment directly to Trump‚Äôs economic goals, saying: ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs announcement with Apple is another win for our manufacturing industry that will simultaneously help reshore the production of critical components to protect America‚Äôs economic and national security.‚Äù Apple‚Äôs stock rose 6% on Wednesday after the pledge, which is its biggest intraday gain since February. Meanwhile, Trump also signed an executive order adding another 25% tariff on goods from India in response to its Russian oil purchases, in addition to a separate 25% duty already scheduled to hit the next day. Apple‚Äôs major reliance on India for iPhone assembly makes it a direct target. Trump has repeatedly pushed Apple to move full iPhone manufacturing to U.S. factories. Earlier this year, after a meeting with Cook, Trump threatened a 25% tariff if the company didn‚Äôt act. While officials have floated ideas like robotics for U.S. assembly, Cook has focused more on securing tariff exemptions. He did this successfully during Trump‚Äôs first term and has been working to do it again. Last week, during a call with analysts, Cook admitted that ‚Äúthe vast majority‚Äù of iPhones sold in the U.S. are still made in India. He added that other products such as MacBooks, iPads, and Apple Watches come from Vietnam. ‚ÄúWe obviously try to optimize our supply chain,‚Äù Cook said. ‚ÄúAnd ultimately, we will do more in the United States.‚Äù Cook also said Apple took an $800 million hit from tariffs in the last quarter and expects that number to rise to $1.1 billion by the end of September unless there are changes in trade policy. That pressure is only increasing. Trump is now preparing to target all products with semiconductor chips with new levies, which could drop as soon as next week. He‚Äôs also expanding country-specific tariffs that will hit dozens of trade partners on Thursday. Trump‚Äôs track record with Apple shows a pattern. During his first term, Cook managed to get several of Apple‚Äôs products exempted from import duties. If he can pull that off again, it could help Apple avoid price hikes that would squeeze its margins, or worse, give competitors like Samsung a pricing advantage. The initial $500 billion commitment Apple made in February included a promise to add 20,000 jobs, but the numbers weren‚Äôt much beyond its previously announced plans. That pledge only added $39 billion and around 1,000 jobs per year. The extra $100 billion is meant to reinforce its U.S. ties ahead of a broader trade crackdown. The Apple news fits into a string of public investment rollouts from the Trump administration. Earlier this year, Trump hosted a joint announcement with Oracle, SoftBank, and OpenAI, revealing a $100 billion investment in AI data centers with plans to hit $500 billion. Separately, Trump said Nvidia plans to manufacture up to $500 billion in AI infrastructure inside the U.S. through new partnerships. The White House has also linked trade deals directly to investment promises. In an agreement with the European Union, Trump secured $750 billion in American energy exports and $600 billion in U.S. investments. A similar deal with Japan led to a $550 billion investment fund targeting American projects.

Investors Rush To New Viral Social Media Altcoin,https://thecoinrise.com/dogecoin-latest-news-could-doge-hit-1-in-2025-investors-rush-to-new-viral-social-media-altcoin/,"Dogecoin is again at the forefront of crypto investors‚Äô minds, with people wondering if this meme token is about to penetrate the long-awaited $1 price point in 2025. After all, this token formed through a community of believers has taken a few more than a few by surprise before. But while some HODLers bet even larger on DOGE, a new trend is forming: investors are setting their sights on a fresh Web3 altcoin that combines DeFi and social media DeSoc . Let‚Äôs get into where DOGE stands today and why this fresh new project is generating so much excitement from meme coin fans. DOGE Drops, But Volume Skyrockets: Can $1 Still Happen? Dogecoin itself sits at $0.2378, down 7.19% in the last 24 hours. Although it did dip, volume has spiked up 72.72%, reaching $5.46 billion, showing DOGE is nowhere near the back burner. Its cap is solid at $35.74 billion, making it well within top crypto valuables. But can it get to $1 in 2025? Experts are split. DOGE has demonstrated its ability to come back strong on social sentiment, influencer backing, and macro trends. But a full dollar will take more than good vibes; it‚Äôll require substantial network growth, utility adoption, and a favorable market cycle. Still, as long as it‚Äôs Elon Musk‚Äôs meme sweetheart and a means of payment in his world, DOGE will never cease to amaze. The Shift to New Tales: Why Meme Coin Investors Turn to DeSoc Dogecoin and Shiba Inu started as jokes, but they built communities so strong that full ecosystems were created. Nowadays, that same community-based might is spreading to projects that blend social value with real crypto utility. Meet DeSoc , a brand-new altcoin trending viral for all the wrong reasons, that is, not because of memes, but because it‚Äôs revolutionizing Web3 identity and decentralized social platforms for good. Here‚Äôs what DOGE holders are jumping in for: Utility-based demand in the next bull cycle Potential for early entry with explosive returns Top-of-mind resonance with decentralized, open-source philosophies Crypto-native social applications that reward influence and trust DOGE cleared the way for DeSoc to operate, and meme fanatics are already hoarding. What Is DeSoc? The DeFi Social Coin Making Waves DeSoc isn‚Äôt a token; it‚Äôs a social infrastructure layer of the decentralized web. It‚Äôs designed to link digital identities between wallets, chains, and platforms, solving a massive problem in crypto: identity fragmentation. Some of the main features are: On-chain social reputation mapped across dApps SOCS token-based governance, rewarding real engagement Simple-to-use APIs for devs to construct social dApps DeFi x Social integration, staking, and reputation-based rewards Over $10 million raised in a viral presale DeSoc is not looking to replace DOGE it‚Äôs developing a whole new lane for crypto adoption. It‚Äôs where utility, influence, and reward meet. DOGE to DeSoc: The Evolution of Community Power What Dogecoin demonstrated is that a strong, passionate community can fuel exponential growth. But whereas DOGE is built on culture and support, DeSoc is building a protocol on the same power, giving it shape, function, and scalability. Meme coin holders know better than anyone the strength of narrative. Now they‚Äôre applying that knowledge up front in efforts such as DeSoc, where value is derived from participation, not speculation. Last Word: Two Tokens, One Direction? Dogecoin can be said to still be an outsider for the $1 mark, especially with its massive trading volume and community backing in the market. And in looking for ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs next,‚Äù most expect the likes of DeSoc , which has something DOGE lacks, an ability to assist in mainstreaming the future of decentralized identity and shape. Be you meme warrior or a utility maxi, 2025 can be the year of both DOGE and DeSoc, both prospering, just differently. Discover the future of decentralized social infrastructure with DeSoc.

Optimism price prediction for 2028 suggests the token could reach a maximum value of $11.14. In 2031, OP tokens will range between $27.9 and $33.66, with an average value of $28.88. Optimism‚Äôs (OP) commitment to innovation is highlighted by its support for Layer-3 solutions. These solutions enable the development of decentralized applications (dApps) on top of Layer-2 chains, contributing to the expansive Optimism Superchain. The platform‚Äôs initiatives, including introducing custom gas tokens and Plasma mode aimed at reducing onboarding and operational costs, make it more accessible for new users and developers. As the market closely watches the price movements and growth trajectory of the token, can Optimism reach $10 soon? Let‚Äôs get into the OP price prediction for 2025 ‚Äì 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Optimism Token OP Price $0.6681 Market Cap $1.17B Trading Volume $161.74M Circulating Supply 1.75B OP All-time High $4.85 (Mar 06, 2024) All-time Low $0.4005 (Jun 18, 2022) 24-hour High $0.6758 24-hour Low $0.6423 Optimism price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 9.68% 50-Day SMA $0.6526 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 54 (Neutral) Green Days 20/30 (67%) 200-Day SMA $0.9632 Optimism price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: OP is trading within $0.65-$0.68 range with diminishing volume. Technical convergence suggests a potential breakout, but indicators favour a downside. Optimism 1-day price chart As of August 6, 2025, OP is trading at $0.667 with a modest +0.91% gain, demonstrating resilience after experiencing significant volatility in recent sessions. The daily chart reveals price action oscillating within a defined range, with the middle Bollinger bands currently positioned around $0.715 at the upper boundary and $0.614 at the lower boundary. OPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The recent candle formation shows alternating red and green sessions, suggesting indecision among market participants, while the balance of power indicator at 0.16 hints at slight bullish momentum building beneath the surface. However, the declining OBV trend from 786.33M raises concerns about weakening volume support, which could limit any potential upside breakout attempts and suggests that institutional interest may be waning during this consolidation phase. Optimism 4-hour price chart The 4-hour chart shows OP down -0.30% from recent highs, while the Alligator indicator shows convergence at the $0.667-$0.669 range, indicating a potential directional decision point approaching. OPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The price has been respecting multiple moving average levels, creating a technical standoff where neither bulls nor bears have gained decisive control, and the 24-hour volume of 16.39M appears adequate but not explosive enough to suggest imminent breakout momentum. The CMF reading of -0.03 signals slight money flow weakness, indicating that despite the relatively stable price action, underlying buying pressure remains subdued and smart money may be quietly rotating out of positions. Optimism technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.6660 BUY SMA 5 $0.6856 SELL SMA 10 $0.7116 SELL SMA 21 $0.7412 SELL SMA 50 $0.6526 BUY SMA 100 $0.6913 SELL SMA 200 $0.9632 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.6805 SELL EMA 5 $0.6686 SELL EMA 10 $0.6672 BUY EMA 21 $0.6990 SELL EMA 50 $0.8266 SELL EMA 100 $1.0544 SELL EMA 200 $1.3483 SELL What to expect from Optimism? OP is likely to keep ranging between $0.65 and $0.68, with direction hinging on volume and market sentiment. Weak volume and negative money flow hint at a possible downside break in the coming sessions. Is Optimism a good crypto investment? Optimism (OP) could be a good investment if you believe in Ethereum scaling and the growth of Layer 2 solutions. However, like all crypto, it‚Äôs risky, and its value depends on adoption and market trends. Only invest what you‚Äôre willing to lose! Will OP recover? A recovery is possible, but we fear the overall bearish sentiment makes a short-term rebound unlikely. However, as the market consolidates, we expect reduced volatility, which may lead to a breakout in either direction, depending on market dynamics. Will Optimism reach $10? Yes, Optimism is projected to close up to $10 by 2028. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in its price. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and require unprecedented growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook.

Optimism historic price sentiment Optimism price history by Coingecko OP launched with an initial value of $4.57 on May 31 but dropped sharply in June due to the UST stablecoin de-pegging and LUNA collapse, closing June at $0.5434. It further declined to $0.4147 by mid-July. In August, OP briefly surged above $1.90, but by mid-October, it dropped to $0.70 following the FTX collapse. In Q1 2023, OP surged past $3.00 during a crypto bull run but lost 66% shortly after. A recovery saw it close the year at $3.90. OP saw an eventful 2024, reaching an all-time high of $4.85 in March before sliding below $2.30 by mid-April. After a brief recovery to over $2.90 in May, it entered a bearish phase, trading at $1.82‚Äì$1.96 by July and $1.54‚Äì$1.62 by October. November brought a spark of hope with a peak at $2.60. OP closed December within the range of $1.611‚Äì$2.773. In January 2025, OP peaked at $2.18 but lost momentum, dropping to as low as $0.84 in February.

While other presales wait behind coming-soon tags, BlockDAG (BDAG) puts users in control now. It shows the full setup before listings begin. So far, BlockDAG has raised $363 million, sold more than 24.7 billion coins, and moved into batch 29 with a price of $0.0276. That reflects a 2,660% ROI since batch 1. Still, the limited-time price of $0.0016 offers a major entry point. It allows early buyers to lock in the price before any listing changes happen. For those who want more than a placeholder, and are looking for access to real trading tools before launch, BlockDAG stands out as the most complete option right now. Chainlink (LINK) Chainlink remains a leading tool for bringing off-chain data onto the blockchain. Its Oracle system supports major parts of crypto like DeFi, NFTs, and digital insurance. With support across Ethereum, Solana, and several Layer-2 networks, it powers apps that need price data, sports updates, or weather inputs. As new trends like AI and DePIN grow, Chainlink‚Äôs role as a trusted data link keeps expanding. It‚Äôs already working with major players such as Swift and DTCC, pointing to more real-world use cases for decentralized finance. Though it might not bring fast price spikes, Chainlink is known for steady value and strong utility. It suits those who want exposure to crypto tools that support major apps. For 2025, it remains one of the best crypto to buy in 2025 for steady and useful growth. Mantle (MNT) Mantle is a fresh Layer-2 scaling system that stands on solid ground. It‚Äôs backed by BitDAO‚Äôs large treasury, which controls more than $2 billion in assets. This gives Mantle strong funding and a place among the best-supported Ethereum scaling networks. Unlike projects that rely on short-term interest, Mantle is quietly building long-term solutions for both performance and decision-making. It uses EigenDA for flexible data access and supports builders and liquidity with its native asset. What makes Mantle stand out is how its setup goes beyond paying gas fees. It connects to a larger system of rewards linked to BitDAO. As more apps launch and funds are used, this setup could drive more usage and price movement. In 2025, Mantle offers a powerful setup, making it one of the best crypto to buy in 2025 for structure and potential. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu started as a meme, but now it runs its own blockchain, exchange, and virtual world. Its network includes Shibarium, SHIB: The Metaverse, and ShibaSwap, a platform for trading digital assets. Going into 2025, SHIB is focusing on growing its tools and user control. Shibarium now supports transactions using BONE, and SHIB supply continues to shrink with regular burns, all while more users join the ecosystem. While it began as a meme, SHIB now brings more to the table than many expect. It mixes strong community backing with new features that boost its value. Though riskier than others here, it‚Äôs still one of the best cryptos to buy in 2025 for those aiming at bigger swings and high reward chances. Final Take Picking the best crypto to buy in 2025 means looking at tools, trust, and actual use. BlockDAG checks all the boxes, with a working trading platform and an entry price that gives more room for gains. Chainlink stays strong as the network backbone, Mantle brings funded growth options, and Shiba Inu moves from hype to working systems. Each one fits a different type of goal, but BlockDAG is moving ahead while others are still setting up.

However, despite this increase in on-chain fundamentals, ETH‚Äôs price continues to trade below major resistance levels, raising concerns that bullish momentum may be fading. Ethereum Network Activity Picks Momentum According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor CryptoOnChain, Ethereum‚Äôs daily transaction count ‚Äì highlighted in pink in the below chart ‚Äì has surged to a new ATH of approximately 1,550,000 transactions per day. This sharp increase in daily transactions, particularly noticeable over the past few months, points to intensified on-chain usage and overall network engagement. In addition to transaction count, other metrics also reflect a spike in activity ‚Äì most notably, the number of unique Ethereum addresses. As of August 5, the total number of unique Ethereum addresses stood at 332,122,674, marking an increase of 207,454 new wallets compared to the previous day. While some of these may belong to existing users creating new addresses, the majority likely represent new participants entering the Ethereum ecosystem. Related Reading: Ethereum Rally Not Fueled By Bitcoin Dump, On-Chain Signals Show CryptoOnChain emphasized that despite these bullish on-chain signals, Ethereum‚Äôs price has not followed suit. As shown in the above chart, ETH‚Äôs price ‚Äì highlighted in orange ‚Äì remains subdued, failing to break above prior highs or key resistance zones. This disconnect between rising network fundamentals and lagging price action may indicate that the market is in an accumulation phase, the analyst said. CryptoOnChain further suggested that Ethereum could be setting the stage for a significant bullish breakout, with potential upside targets reaching as high as $5,000. Is ETH Price Headed For A New ATH? In a separate analysis posted on X, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto shared the following ETH monthly chart, noting that the asset is ‚Äúcompressing within a massive monthly triangle.‚Äù According to the analyst, a successful breakout from this pattern could potentially drive ETH toward $8,000. For the uninitiated, the triangle pattern is a chart formation that occurs when price action consolidates between converging trendlines, forming a shape that resembles a triangle. It typically indicates a period of indecision that often resolves with a breakout in the direction of the prior trend, signaling continuation or reversal depending on the context. Related Reading: Is Ethereum Gearing Up for a Major Move? Analysts Split on What‚Äôs Next Another well-known analyst, Gert van Lagen, echoed a similar outlook. He noted that ETH may be positioning for a powerful breakout, with a projected price target of up to $9,000, citing growing technical and fundamental support. Meanwhile, on-chain exchange data also supports a bullish narrative. Over the past two weeks, more than 1 million ETH has been withdrawn from centralized exchanges ‚Äì fuelling speculations about a potential supply crunch. At press time, ETH trades at $3,590, down 1.1% in the past 24 hours.

Investors are already speculating that such a move could reignite an explosive altcoin season‚Äîone that mirrors the massive runs seen during Ethereum and Bitcoin ETF approvals. The excitement is also pushing attention toward lesser-known opportunities, with MAGACOIN FINANCE emerging as a standout contender. Its potential upside has analysts comparing it to XRP‚Äôs 2017 bull market surge. XRP ETF Hype Heats Up After years of legal hurdles, Ripple appears to be on the verge of a breakthrough. Sources close to the matter suggest that discussions with major financial institutions‚Äîincluding BlackRock and Fidelity‚Äîare ramping up, with ETF paperwork likely to follow once Ripple‚Äôs final settlement with the SEC is confirmed. This would mark a huge shift in how institutional investors access XRP and could drive billions in capital into the asset. Historically, similar ETF approvals have triggered steep price rallies. For example, Bitcoin surged over 60% after the spot ETF greenlight earlier this year, and Ethereum saw double-digit gains ahead of its futures-based ETF. XRP‚Äôs price currently sits near $2.45, and many believe the ETF news could push it past its previous all-time high of $3.84. This Altcoin Could Outperform If XRP Ignites the Market With attention building around Ripple, smart money is starting to look for altcoins that could ride the ETF wave. That‚Äôs where MAGACOIN FINANCE enters the picture. Analysts say this new project could deliver up to 20,300% gains , thanks to its growing community, real-world use cases , and ongoing development. The presale is gaining traction fast, with early investors already seeing impressive growth. If the XRP ETF unlocks a fresh altcoin rally, MAGACOIN FINANCE could become one of the biggest winners, offering a high-risk, high-reward entry for forward-thinking investors. What Comes Next for XRP and Altcoins? The countdown to August 15, 2025, is critical. That‚Äôs the deadline for Ripple and the SEC to file their joint status update, widely expected to confirm the final terms of their settlement. Once that happens, the regulatory fog over XRP clears‚Äîand so does the path for institutions to enter through ETFs. In the meantime, traders are rotating into altcoins that could benefit from XRP‚Äôs momentum. Ethereum, Cardano, and Solana are all gaining volume, but newer names like MAGACOIN FINANCE are seeing a bigger surge in speculative interest due to their upside potential and low market caps. Conclusion: If Ripple lands its ETF approval, it could mark the beginning of a powerful altcoin season. Historical patterns show that ETF approvals don‚Äôt just boost the coin in question‚Äîthey lift the entire crypto ecosystem. For investors looking beyond the top 10, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a high-ROI investment , with analysts forecasting breakout-level gains should XRP spark the next rally.

49663787,549402,1754524822,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49663787.jpeg,Binance Former Leader Seeks Quick Exit From $1.8 Billion FTX Lawsuit,https://bitcoinist.com/binance-former-leader-seeks-quick-exit-from-1-8-billion-ftx-lawsuit/,"Former Binance CEO Changpeng ‚ÄúCZ‚Äù Zhao has moved to shake off a $1.76 billion clawback bid from the now-bankrupt FTX trust. It‚Äôs a bold opening move. Based on reports, he argues the case should never have landed in a Delaware court. Challenge To Delaware Jurisdiction According to a report , Zhao insists he lives in the United Arab Emirates and has no real ties to Delaware. He points out that the complaint doesn‚Äôt show he‚Äôs ‚Äúat home‚Äù there. His lawyers say the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware lacks power to decide this fight. If the judge agrees, FTX may have to find a new venue or refile elsewhere. Those jurisdiction rules matter when you‚Äôre chasing a humongous amount of money like $1.76 billion. FTX says the money flowed from a share purchase deal in 2021. Binance snapped up those shares just as FTX was heading toward insolvency. Zhao‚Äôs team calls that claim weak. They claim it falls outside US laws because the deal and his actions mostly took place overseas. Fight Over Fraud Claims Based on the motion filed on Monday, Zhao‚Äôs side also questions whether US fraud rules can stretch beyond America‚Äôs borders. He argues that the regulations at issue don‚Äôt apply to someone living in the UAE. Reports have disclosed that he challenged what lawyers call ‚Äúconstructive fraud‚Äù counts. Those counts hinge on federal definitions tied to securities contracts, Zhao‚Äôs filing says. FTX first sued Binance and Zhao back in November 2024. At that time, a Binance spokesperson blasted the effort as ‚Äúmeritless.‚Äù They said the trust was trying to shift blame for FTX‚Äôs collapse onto Binance and its founder. Binance already filed a similar motion to dismiss in May. That earlier paper noted FTX blamed Binance for ‚Äúpervasive malfeasance‚Äù by Sam Bankman-Fried. Weighing The Prior Motions That May motion raised many of the same points now front and center. It highlighted that FTX‚Äôs lawyers pointed to emails and wire transfers routed through US banks. Binance replied that those links aren‚Äôt enough. They argued simple financial messages don‚Äôt create a business ‚Äúpresence‚Äù in Delaware. Sam Bankman-Fried is serving a 25-year sentence for fraud and conspiracy. Whatever happens next, this fight over venue and jurisdiction will set the stage for a long legal battle over who pays for FTX‚Äôs losses. Zhao himself served four months in prison after pleading guilty to US anti-money laundering charges. The Pushback Meanwhile, FTX trust attorneys are expected to push back. They‚Äôll stress that billions of dollars moved through US accounts. They‚Äôll say those wires and phone calls establish jurisdiction under longstanding rules. The court‚Äôs decision on this procedural step could stretch on for months.

As X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram face mounting pressure for censorship, data harvesting, and algorithmic manipulation, blockchain-based alternatives are picking up serious traction. One of the major players in this new space is DeSoc , a new viral altcoin that‚Äôs about to revolutionize the way we socialize, converse, and make money online. While Solana has taken charge in rapid-speed blockchain adoption, experts now believe DeSoc may be up to par not in terms of TPS speed, but in revolutionizing the social aspect of Web3. Solana Dips as Investors Watch the Next Big Thing Solana is currently priced at $186, up 1% in the past 24 hours. Its market cap has a strong hold at $100 billion, with its trading volume up by 14.1% to $11.49 billion, a guarantee that there is action for SOL even during declines. Being one of the most scalable and fastest blockchains, Solana is well sought after for DeFi, NFTs, and meme coins. Even at its pace, however, Solana has failed to solve the social media equation. That‚Äôs where DeSoc is gaining traction, one that isn‚Äôt throughput-based, but trust, identity, and participation. DeSoc: Integrating Social Media, DeFi, and Digital Identity DeSoc is an emerging altcoin project that turns the Web3 experience on its head. Instead of simply storing data or swapping tokens, DeSoc enables individuals to build portable social identities usable in both dApps and blockchains. Here is how DeSoc is different: Decentralized reputation systems tied to wallet activity Interoperable social IDs you own not Big Tech Crypto-native social streams and voting systems Rewards engagement, not speculation Over $10M presale, with virality growing by the day This doesn‚Äôt just make DeSoc a sharing or messaging platform but a foundation layer for the future of digital society. Is DeSoc Able to Compete with Solana? Not in Speed, But in Influence Solana has no equal when it comes to performance metrics, with thousands of transactions per second and negligible gas fees. But while Solana focuses on infrastructure, DeSoc focuses on experience. Web2 social media is algorithm-driven and platform-controlled sites that moderate what people can see, monetize information, and pay advertisers rather than users. DeSoc flips this model on its head by putting users first, paying them, and making them cross-platform transportable. Crypto users no longer accept pumping tokens only. They want networks that give them something, influence, reputation, and community ownership. That‚Äôs DeSoc‚Äôs battlefield. And with meme coin holders, DeFi enthusiasts, and creators all searching for ways to participate and earn better, DeSoc can be among the few projects that can compete with Solana‚Äôs user growth, but from a different angle. Why DeSoc Is Gaining Attention Now Timing is everything in crypto, and DeSoc is riding a few waves: Need for decentralized identity Resistance to Big Tech censorship Cross-chain integration is becoming a requirement Utility in the real world drives altcoin adoption With a token that rewards users and builders, and a presale of over $10 million, DeSoc isn‚Äôt merely riding the social crypto wave; it‚Äôs leading it. Last Take: The Social Layer of Web3 Is Here Solana will remain a crypto behemoth of high-performance infrastructure. Infrastructure needs apps, users, and activity, and that is where DeSoc will thrive. As online communities grow, and identity is the new currency of trust, DeSoc is building perhaps the most impactful layer of Web3 to date. Whether you‚Äôre a creator, investor, or DeFi enthusiast, DeSoc offers a powerful new way to connect, earn, and belong in the crypto space.

Each is moving forward for different reasons. Cold Wallet has passed $5.8 million in its presale, showing potential for a 4,900% return from its current price to launch. Ethereum still leads in DeFi. Solana brings speed and rising volume, while Polkadot connects blockchains through modular tools. These projects range widely in price, from under $0.01 to above $3,622, but each offers something unique. Among them, Cold Wallet takes a different route by focusing on active users instead of future plans. That shift in approach makes it stand out among today‚Äôs top trending crypto to buy options. 1. Cold Wallet: Cashback Model Grows After $270M Deal Cold Wallet‚Äôs presale is now in Stage 16, with CWT priced at $0.00942. Over 645 million tokens are sold, and more than $5.8 million has already been raised. The token‚Äôs confirmed listing at $0.3517 points to a possible 4,900% gain. This growth follows the $270 million purchase of Plus Wallet, adding 2 million users and expanding reach in the self-custody wallet space. Cold Wallet ($CWT) stands out by offering cashback on everyday crypto use like gas, swaps, and transfers. There‚Äôs no staking or lockups involved. The system works within the wallet, providing simple rewards that give it an edge over wallets like MetaMask, which still face complaints about user flow and onboarding. Plus Wallet‚Äôs fast growth since early 2025 showed that ease of use matters. Now Cold Crypto Wallet plans to build on that, combining feedback into one stronger system across the two platforms. The ColdWallet.com domain was valued at only $2 million, which suggests the rest of the deal reflects product strength and real adoption. That level of working utility places Cold Wallet firmly among the top trending crypto to buy for those who value results over hype.. As presale momentum builds and more users migrate, Cold Wallet is shifting from a single app into a larger product ecosystem. 2. Ethereum‚Äôs Upgrades Keep It Strong in a Changing Market Ethereum is still a key part of the blockchain space, with its price near $3,622. As the top smart contract platform, it supports major DeFi apps, NFT sites, and enterprise tools. Backed by strong use and long-term support, Ethereum stays a leading option among the top trending crypto to buy. Its Dencun upgrade helped cut costs and improve network performance, which helps it stay ahead as Layer 2 platforms grow. The move to proof-of-stake has lowered energy use and added a burn system, which slowly reduces the token supply. Ethereum still faces challenges during times of high traffic, but its focus on rollups and Layer 2 solutions is helping to fix that. The network is working toward a more scalable future without losing its leading role. 3. Solana‚Äôs High-Speed Use Grows with Key Partnerships Solana, priced around $168.96, is seeing high demand from fast-moving apps. Its low fees and fast processing make it a top choice for games, NFTs, and memecoins. With more than 20 million daily transactions, its usage continues to grow. Connections with major names like Shopify and Visa give Solana extra weight in the space. The builder community is also active, with over 2,500 developers working on updates and tools. With its strong performance and growing set of features, Solana is often listed as a top trending crypto to buy for users who want speed and live interactions. While past outages raised concerns, recent improvements in network stability have helped rebuild trust in 2025. 4. Polkadot‚Äôs Design Connects Projects Across Blockchains Polkadot trades near $3.65 and is built to run many blockchains in parallel through parachains. This setup makes it great for projects that need speed and cross-chain links. It is becoming a go-to for builders looking for smooth connections between different networks. The developer base is growing, and many teams are testing on Polkadot or bidding in parachain auctions. Its tech is strong, and its focus on easy blockchain links supports its place as a top trending crypto to buy among infrastructure-first developers. Still, Polkadot‚Äôs name isn‚Äôt widely known outside of crypto circles. But new funding and fresh marketing in 2025 aim to fix that, giving the platform a chance to reach more users and builders. One Project Is Gaining the Lead as the Year Moves Forward Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot, and Cold Wallet all offer value in different ways. Ethereum has proven systems, Solana leads on speed, and Polkadot offers smooth chain-to-chain communication. But Cold Wallet is moving quickly. It has raised over $5.8 million in crypto presale 2025 , offers a 4,900% projected return, and completed a $270 million acquisition of Plus Wallet. This mix of momentum, users, and live features is making it stand out. As the end of 2025 gets closer, time to join early projects is running out. For those looking at the next top trending crypto to buy, Cold Wallet‚Äôs progress shows it may be ahead of the curve.

49663811,https://timestabloid.com/?p=77163,1754524856,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP‚Äôs Potential Price Target in a $20 Trillion Crypto Market Cap,https://timestabloid.com/xrps-potential-price-target-in-a-20-trillion-crypto-market-cap/,"As of now, the global cryptocurrency market is valued at approximately $3.7 trillion. XRP remains one of the few digital assets maintaining a substantial market share in this landscape. Currently, XRP holds around 4% of the total market capitalization, with a valuation of $123 billion. In comparison, other notable altcoins trail behind. Cardano represents just 0.63% of the market with a $20 billion capitalization, while Binance Coin (BNB) and Solana account for 2.78% and 2.29% respectively. The leading positions, however, continue to be held by Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the stablecoin USDT. Bitcoin dominates the market with a 64% share, valued at over $2 trillion. Ethereum holds 9%, and USDT represents approximately 5%. Forecasting XRP‚Äôs Potential in a $20 Trillion Market Analysts anticipate that the total value of the crypto market could exceed $20 trillion during the current bullish cycle. Some commentators, including popular voices like Capt Toblerone, have suggested the market could expand even further, to as much as $35 trillion. Assuming XRP maintains its current 4% market share in a $20 trillion crypto market, its capitalization would rise to $800 billion. With a circulating supply of approximately 58.93 billion tokens, this would place XRP at a price of around $13.57 per token. Such a price level would establish a new all-time high for XRP, which has remained below its historical peak for over seven years. Several analysts have predicted that XRP could reach or exceed $13 in this cycle, with some anticipating prices above $20 if adoption and demand continue to increase. Institutional Adoption May Influence Valuation Recent developments have introduced new factors that may support a higher valuation for XRP. Beyond traditional price modeling based on technical analysis and historical data, institutional interest in XRP has grown. The launch of XRP-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and its potential inclusion in corporate treasury strategies suggest that demand from institutional investors may significantly impact the asset‚Äôs price trajectory. If such developments persist, XRP could experience upward pressure beyond what market share analysis alone would predict. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Implications for Other Major Cryptocurrencies Applying the same model to other leading cryptocurrencies yields substantial growth projections. If Bitcoin retains its 64% dominance , its market capitalization in a $20 trillion market would rise to $12.8 trillion, translating to an estimated price of over $644,000 per BTC. Ethereum, maintaining its 9% share, would achieve a $1.8 trillion valuation, crossing the trillion-dollar threshold. Stablecoin USDT would rise to roughly $966 billion. Altcoins such as BNB and Solana would also experience significant gains, with market caps reaching $556 billion and $458 billion, respectively. Cardano, maintaining a 0.63% share, would see its valuation increase to approximately $126 billion. This would place ADA at a projected price of $3.56, approaching its previous all-time high of $3.10. XRP‚Äôs current market share positions it for substantial price growth if the broader cryptocurrency market reaches the projected $20 trillion mark. Provided XRP sustains its share and continues to benefit from institutional interest and ecosystem integration, a price exceeding $13 appears within reach under favorable conditions.

Three altcoins, DeSoc , Avalanche (AVAX), and Solana, are gaining serious traction for very different but equally powerful reasons. From user-owned social platforms to high-speed DeFi ecosystems, these projects are lighting up watchlists everywhere. Here‚Äôs why DeSoc, AVAX, and Solana stand out as explosive buys right now. Avalanche Attracts New Volume As It Eyes $30 Avalanche is steadily rebuilding momentum, positioning itself as one of the most explosive altcoins to watch right now. After a period of sideways movement and macro-driven dips, AVAX is now trading around $23.72, with analysts pointing to a possible breakout. Despite a minor pullback of 1.27% in the last 24 hours, the project holds strong with nearly $900 million in trading volume. Market analyst Ali Martinez highlighted $26 as the key resistance level if breached, Avalanche could trigger a swift rally toward $30 or even $35. Another analyst, CryptoShadow , sees this as part of a larger bullish continuation, not just a temporary spike. Avalanche‚Äôs technicals align with broader bullish sentiment across the market, with renewed buying pressure supporting the case for upside. As Bitcoin steadies and altcoins regain ground, AVAX is following with conviction. The ecosystem is showing signs of renewed activity, drawing attention from traders and long-term investors alike. Avalanche is no longer just recovering, it‚Äôs preparing for lift-off. Analysts Say Solana‚Äôs Chart Looks Ready For More Solana is gaining serious attention once again as it reclaims a strong position above the $200 level. After weeks of choppy trading and sideways movement, the token has broken through key resistance and is now setting up for what many analysts believe could be a major run. With daily volume soaring past $38 billion and its market cap holding steady at over $108 billion, Solana sits confidently in the top five. Analyst ZYN highlighted its breakout above $200 as a pivotal moment, calling the structure ‚Äúclean‚Äù with higher highs and higher lows. Another respected voice, Ali Martinez , pointed out that SOL recently broke out of an ascending triangle, often a signal of steep upside ahead. His next targets range from $300 to $360 if the momentum holds. Meanwhile, meaningful resistance doesn‚Äôt appear until the $260 mark, giving SOL room to run. If buyers remain active, this rally could only be getting started. Among the top altcoins right now, Solana is not just participating it‚Äôs leading. SOCS Token Unlocks A New Era Of Online Monetization DeSoc is quickly emerging as one of the most explosive altcoins to buy right now, not just for its tech, but for its mission. Built on blockchain, DeSoc is taking a direct shot at centralized social platforms by giving power back to users. It‚Äôs not just about content; it‚Äôs about ownership, monetization, and identity.

The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with recent reports of a truly significant event: a massive ETH whale accumulation . Over the past three days, a single entity has amassed an astounding amount of Ethereum, signaling a potentially bullish outlook for the popular altcoin. This kind of substantial Ethereum accumulation by a major player often captures the market‚Äôs attention, leading to widespread speculation about future price movements and market sentiment. What is This Gigantic ETH Whale Accumulation? Recent on-chain data, highlighted by crypto analyst @EmberCN on X, reveals that a prominent whale or institution, operating through a wallet created via BitGo, has made colossal moves in the Ethereum market. This entity has rapidly acquired a substantial volume of ETH, indicating strong conviction in Ethereum‚Äôs value proposition. Recent Inflow: In a span of just 20 hours, the wallet received 27,073 ETH, valued at approximately $97.62 million. This significant inflow immediately caught the eye of market observers. Total Accumulation: Over the last three days, the same entity has accumulated a staggering total of 128,204 ETH. This entire stash is worth around $464.5 million, marking one of the largest single crypto whale movements seen recently. These large-scale transactions were facilitated through several institutional-grade platforms, including FalconX, Galaxy Digital, and BitGo. The involvement of such platforms suggests that this is likely an institutional investor rather than an individual trader. Who is Behind This Institutional ETH Accumulation? While the exact identity of the ‚Äòwhale‚Äô remains anonymous, the use of platforms like BitGo, FalconX, and Galaxy Digital strongly points towards an institutional entity. These platforms are well-known for providing secure and compliant services to institutional clients, including hedge funds, asset managers, and corporations looking to engage with digital assets. BitGo, for instance, is a leading provider of digital asset financial services, specializing in security, custody, and liquidity. FalconX offers institutional prime brokerage services for digital assets, while Galaxy Digital is a diversified financial services and investment management company in the digital asset sector. Their involvement underscores the growing trend of institutional ETH adoption. Why Does This Ethereum Whale Activity Matter? The actions of a crypto whale , especially one engaging in such significant large ETH buys , often serve as a bellwether for market sentiment. When a major holder makes a substantial purchase, it can be interpreted in several ways: Strong Confidence: It suggests that the whale has high conviction in Ethereum‚Äôs long-term potential and believes the current price offers a favorable entry point. Market Influence: Such a large acquisition can influence market dynamics, potentially creating upward price pressure as demand increases. Institutional Interest: It highlights increasing institutional interest in Ethereum, which can bring more stability and legitimacy to the asset class. This level of Ethereum accumulation could signal a shift in market sentiment, potentially encouraging other investors to follow suit. It reflects a strategic long-term play, rather than short-term speculation. What Are the Implications of These Large ETH Buys? The implications of this significant ETH whale accumulation are multifaceted. Firstly, it adds considerable buying pressure to the Ethereum market. When a single entity purchases nearly half a billion dollars worth of ETH, it absorbs a substantial portion of available supply, which can naturally lead to price appreciation if sustained demand follows. Secondly, it reinforces the narrative of Ethereum as a prime asset for institutional portfolios. As more traditional financial players look to diversify into digital assets, Ethereum‚Äôs robust ecosystem, encompassing DeFi, NFTs, and a vast developer community, makes it an attractive option. This particular institutional ETH move could pave the way for more large-scale investments. Finally, it serves as a vote of confidence in Ethereum‚Äôs ongoing developments, such as scalability improvements and the transition to Ethereum 2.0 (now known as the Merge and subsequent upgrades). These technological advancements enhance Ethereum‚Äôs utility and appeal, making it a valuable asset for long-term holding. In conclusion, the recent ETH whale accumulation of $464.5 million in just three days is a powerful indicator of strong institutional conviction in Ethereum. This massive inflow of capital, facilitated by leading institutional platforms, underscores Ethereum‚Äôs growing appeal as a cornerstone digital asset. It hints at a potentially bullish future, as large players position themselves for what they believe will be significant long-term gains. This development truly makes waves in the crypto sea, offering a compelling narrative for Ethereum‚Äôs trajectory. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is an ETH whale? A: An ETH whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of Ethereum, enough to potentially influence its market price through their buying or selling activities. Q2: Why is this specific ETH accumulation significant? A: This accumulation is significant due to its sheer size ($464.5 million) and the short timeframe (3 days), indicating strong conviction and potentially institutional backing, which can signal broader market confidence. Q3: Who is BitGo and why are they mentioned? A: BitGo is a leading digital asset trust and security company that provides institutional-grade custody, trading, and finance solutions. Their involvement suggests that the whale is likely an institutional investor due to the high-security and compliance requirements for such large transactions. Q4: Does this large ETH accumulation guarantee a price increase for Ethereum? A: While a large accumulation often indicates bullish sentiment and can contribute to price appreciation, it does not guarantee a price increase. Cryptocurrency markets are complex and influenced by many factors, including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory news, and overall market sentiment. Q5: How can I track crypto whale movements? A: You can track crypto whale movements using on-chain analytics platforms and blockchain explorers that monitor large transactions and wallet activities. Many crypto news outlets and social media accounts also report on significant whale movements. Did you find this analysis of the recent ETH whale accumulation insightful?

With billions flowing into meme coin projects, the digital asset class, once considered a joke, is now commanding serious attention from traders, influencers, and early adopters. Meme coins have transformed from fringe experiments to top cryptos to join in 2025, offering a rare combination of relatability, market energy, and presale upside that traditional tokens struggle to match. While the buzz centers around familiar names, the real momentum lies in what‚Äôs emerging now. The rising class of meme coins, including MoonBull ($MOBU), Floki ($FLOKI), Brett ($BRETT), and Popcat ($POPCAT), is redefining early-stage opportunity. These tokens have layered tokenomics, communities with viral potential, and accessible price points that invite both new and seasoned crypto investors. 1. MoonBull ($MOBU) MoonBull ($MOBU) is built for Ethereum users and meme coin enthusiasts who are focused on high-velocity gains and smart contract reliability. This token is laser-focused on rewarding early-stage participants through an advanced staking system and mystery token drops. Its DeFi integration gives it structural depth, while its meme branding taps into the viral power of internet culture. MoonBull‚Äôs roadmap is intentionally guarded, revealing insights only to whitelist members. This design rewards those who engage early and adds a layer of exclusivity that intensifies demand. What also makes MoonBull compelling is its Ethereum foundation, which ensures secure, scalable infrastructure for DeFi and token interactions. Here‚Äôs what whitelist members will gain: Access at the lowest token price Unlock secret staking rewards Receive bonus token allocations Get private insights into the roadmap These perks won‚Äôt be shared publicly. Once the allocation fills, that‚Äôs it. No resets, no retries. MoonBull made it to this list of top cryptos to join in 2025 due to its intelligent mix of exclusivity, strong tokenomics, and presale architecture that supports rapid early-stage growth. Learn from Missed Chances: What Hesitation Can Cost Picture an investor scrolling through forums in 2013, dismissing Dogecoin as just another online joke. Or someone briefly considering Shiba Inu before its parabolic rise, only to move on without action. These moments become cautionary tales repeated in hindsight. MoonBull‚Äôs whitelist offers a chance to change that narrative. It represents a rare gateway to early-stage entry ‚Äì before the broader market awakens. While Stage One of the presale will eventually open to all, whitelist members receive private notice of the exact launch time and gain access before the public. The clock is ticking, and for those who understand that timing is everything, this may be the pivotal window that sets a portfolio apart. 2. Floki ($FLOKI) Floki ($FLOKI) gained its initial popularity due to its Elon Musk, but it has since matured into a robust ecosystem with utility and staying power. Its roadmap includes NFT gaming, metaverse expansion, and educational crypto platforms designed for new users. Built on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain, Floki has positioned itself as more than just a meme ‚Äì it‚Äôs a movement. Floki‚Äôs appeal lies in its trifecta approach: entertainment, education, and earning potential. The team has pushed hard into real-world use cases, with recent announcements around DeFi product integrations and community-driven philanthropic initiatives. Investors are drawn to Floki for its unique ability to balance humor and long-term strategy. It continues to build decentralized products, strengthening its case as one of the top cryptos to join in 2025. Floki earned its place on this list for blending meme culture with utility, delivering long-term vision and community leadership that attracts both new and experienced investors. 3. Brett ($BRETT) Brett ($BRETT) is a newcomer that leverages meme virality while integrating advanced token features for serious traders. What sets Brett apart is its dual-token economy and unique burn mechanics that support long-term price action. It thrives on cultural relevance, especially among Gen Z investors who resonate with its branding and storytelling. From limited NFT collections to gamified staking events, Brett is creating an ecosystem that is both fun and functional. The project‚Äôs team has consistently delivered on milestones, increasing confidence in its roadmap. The community behind Brett is rapidly expanding, thanks to creative airdrop campaigns and meme challenges that spread across TikTok and X. This gives it strong viral legs ‚Äì a critical feature for breakout meme coins. Brett is included among the top cryptos to join in 2025 due to its creative burn economy, dual-token design, and cultural magnetism that translates into real market momentum. 4. Popcat ($POPCAT) Popcat ($POPCAT) blends nostalgia and innovation. Inspired by a viral meme, it has evolved into a fully-fledged ecosystem complete with liquidity rewards, staking options, and gamified user interactions. Built on the Solana blockchain, Popcat offers speed, scalability, and very low transaction costs ‚Äì features that new users and day traders appreciate. One of Popcat‚Äôs biggest innovations is its meme-fueled GameFi engine. Users can earn rewards through mini-games, referrals, and content engagement. This model builds long-term user retention and continuous on-chain activity. In a time when attention spans are short and users seek quick ROI, Popcat provides both entertainment and income. Its branding is instantly recognizable, and its ecosystem is simple to navigate. Popcat secured its spot in this list of top cryptos to join in 2025 due to its GameFi integration, strong brand recall, and Solana-based performance that caters to active traders. Conclusion Based on the latest research, the top cryptos to join in 2025 include Moon Bull , Floki, Brett, and Popcat. Each of these projects brings a distinct blend of meme culture, smart tokenomics, and presale opportunity. However, MoonBull‚Äôs live whitelist access makes it the most time-sensitive opportunity among them. Whitelists remain a strategic way for investors to access new markets at rock-bottom prices before public trading drives up value. With MoonBull‚Äôs exclusive Stage One access and early staking rewards only available to whitelisted members, now is the time to act. The world is watching crypto adoption grow. Countries are adding Bitcoin to reserves, institutional players are entering meme territory, and early-stage tokens are offering unheard-of gains. This could be the tipping point for a new crypto wave, and MoonBull is leading the charge. For More Information: Website: https://www.moonbull.io/ Telegram: https://t.me/MoonBullCoin Twitter: https://x.com/MoonBullX FAQs What is the benefit of joining a crypto whitelist like MoonBull‚Äôs? Joining the whitelist gives users early access to tokens at the lowest possible price, plus exclusive rewards and insights that are not made public before launch. How do meme coins generate value beyond hype? Modern meme coins integrate DeFi utilities, staking, and community-based rewards, offering real value alongside viral branding.

Is it safe to join the MoonBull whitelist? MoonBull uses a secure whitelist form and Ethereum smart contracts, offering reliability and transparency for users.

Which Of These Is A Wiser Investment In 2025",https://thecoinrise.com/desoc-ripple-or-cardano-which-of-these-is-a-wiser-investment-in-2025/,"As the crypto market evolves, investors are looking beyond hype and into real-world value. Ripple, Cardano, and the rising star DeSoc each offer something different: payments, infrastructure, and decentralized social media. But which one holds the smartest potential for 2025? Whether you‚Äôre drawn to utility, long-term growth, or user-driven innovation, this breakdown explores which of these three could be the wisest investment this year. XRP Hits Resistance As Analysts Warn Of A Pullback XRP has delivered solid gains in July, jumping over 55% and continuing its five-year streak of closing the month in the green. But recent signals suggest that the momentum may be cooling. The token reached just below its all-time high of $3.80, only to form what analysts now call a double top, a classic sign of potential reversal. Crypto analyst Tradersboat pointed out that XRP has shown signs of buyer exhaustion, along with a Break of Structure, indicating bears may be gaining control. Resistance at $3.60 has held firm, with rejection from that level adding weight to the bearish case. While another short-term push to $3.70 remains possible, the larger setup points to a potential drop below $3.40. Historically, August has been one of XRP‚Äôs weakest months, with the past three years showing an average 12% dip after strong Julys. This pattern might repeat if sentiment shifts. While XRP has strong fundamentals, timing could be critical for new investors deciding between Ripple, Cardano, or a rising player like DeSoc. Cardano‚Äôs Price Weakens But Network Development Stays Strong Cardano is facing renewed pressure after a sharp 15% drop sent its price down to around $0.77. The fall broke through key support zones, triggering stop-losses and sparking concerns of a deeper slide. Investor sentiment has cooled as the SEC paused Bitwise‚Äôs multi-asset ETF, which included ADA. That move, though involving a small allocation, echoed broader regulatory uncertainty now hanging over altcoins. On-chain signals aren‚Äôt helping the case either daily active users have dropped below 40,000, and DeFi TVL has slipped to $382 million. The MACD has flipped negative, and the RSI still leaves room for further downside. If $0.73 doesn‚Äôt hold, some traders expect a test of $0.68 . Yet, beneath the bearish short-term setup, Cardano‚Äôs fundamentals remain quietly strong. The network is still expanding, with over 2,000 active projects, new smart contract upgrades, and Layer-2 innovations like Hydra progressing. It may not be the flashiest right now, but Cardano continues to build. In a long-term portfolio, that development focus could still count for a lot. Why DeSoc Offers More Than Just Social Media DeSoc is quickly standing out as one of the most forward-thinking crypto projects of 2025. Unlike Ripple and Cardano, which are focused on payments and infrastructure, DeSoc is tackling something far more personal: how we communicate, share, and connect online. At its center is the SOCS token, with which DeSoc enables individuals to get the most out of their content, their information, and their digital identity. No more algorithm black boxes. No more data exploitation. Users can publish across platforms like Facebook and Twitter while still owning everything they share. Governance isn‚Äôt reserved for insiders. SOCS holders have real voting power to shape how the platform evolves. Creators will be able to increase their availability, place targeted advertisements, and be rewarded for engaging. Under the hood, DeSoc has already locked team tokens for 2 years and liquidity for 30, which is an indicator of long-term stability. Regular audits and a clear token allocation model build even more trust. While Ripple and Cardano focus on systems, DeSoc focuses on people. If you‚Äôre looking for a crypto investment with real-world use, community power, and long-term growth potential, DeSoc might be the wisest bet in 2025.

This significant eight-point jump from the previous day indicates a notable shift in investor sentiment across the cryptocurrency landscape, moving from ‚ÄòNeutral‚Äô into the ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô zone. What does this heightened sense of optimism mean for your digital asset holdings? What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and Why Does it Matter? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, provided by the software development platform Alternative, serves as a thermometer for the cryptocurrency market‚Äôs emotional state. It ranges from 0 to 100, where 0 signifies extreme fear and 100 indicates extreme greed. This index helps investors understand whether the market is overly fearful (a potential buying opportunity) or overly greedy (a potential correction risk). Understanding this index is vital. When the index shows high market greed , it often suggests that prices might be overextended. Conversely, extreme fear can signal a bottoming out. This tool provides a unique perspective on the collective psyche of crypto participants. Decoding the Shift: From Neutral to Market Greed As of August 7, the index stands at 62, firmly placing the market in the ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô category. This rise from the ‚ÄòNeutral‚Äô zone suggests that optimism is growing, and more participants are feeling bullish about crypto assets. This shift can be a double-edged sword for investors. While increased optimism can fuel further price appreciation, it also carries risks. High levels of market greed often precede market corrections as investors become less cautious. It is essential to remember that sentiment can change quickly, influencing price volatility. How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? The index considers six different factors to arrive at its score, providing a comprehensive view of crypto market sentiment : Volatility (25%): Measures current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Compares current volume and market momentum with average values. Social Media (15%): Analyzes keywords on various social media platforms. Surveys (15%): Polls investors to gauge their sentiment (currently paused). Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Assesses Bitcoin‚Äôs share of the total crypto market cap. Google Trends (10%): Looks at search queries related to Bitcoin. These components collectively paint a picture of prevailing investor sentiment , helping to identify potential market tops or bottoms based on emotional extremes. Understanding Bitcoin Dominance and Its Role Bitcoin dominance is a key factor in the index. It measures Bitcoin‚Äôs market capitalization relative to the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. A rising Bitcoin dominance can indicate that investors are moving towards the perceived safety of Bitcoin, potentially pulling liquidity from altcoins. Conversely, falling dominance might suggest an ‚Äòaltcoin season‚Äô where capital flows into other digital assets. The index uses this metric because Bitcoin often leads the market. Its dominance can signal broader trends and shifts in crypto market sentiment , affecting the overall fear or greed levels across the entire ecosystem. Navigating the Greed Zone: Actionable Insights for Investors When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index shows significant market greed , what should investors consider? This is a time for careful planning rather than impulsive decisions. While the rising sentiment can be exciting, seasoned investors often use periods of extreme greed as a signal to exercise caution. Here are some actionable insights: Review Your Portfolio: Consider rebalancing or taking some profits, especially from highly appreciated assets. Avoid FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out): Do not let the rising sentiment push you into hasty purchases at potentially inflated prices. Conduct Due Diligence: Always research thoroughly before investing, regardless of market sentiment. Set Stop-Loss Orders: Protect your investments from sudden downturns if the sentiment shifts rapidly. Remember, the index is a sentiment indicator, not a definitive buy or sell signal. It serves as a valuable tool to understand the prevailing emotions that drive market behavior. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index reaching 62 and entering the ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô zone highlights a significant shift in the market‚Äôs emotional landscape. While this reflects growing optimism and potentially upward price momentum, it also signals a time for prudence. By understanding the factors that influence this index and exercising disciplined investment strategies, you can better navigate the evolving crypto market sentiment and make informed decisions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does a score of 62 mean on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? A score of 62 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index means the market has entered the ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô zone. This indicates that investors are feeling optimistic and bullish, potentially leading to increased buying activity and higher prices. What factors influence the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The index considers six factors: volatility (25%), market momentum/volume (25%), social media activity (15%), surveys (15% ‚Äì currently paused), Bitcoin dominance (10%), and Google Trends data (10%). Is high greed good for the crypto market? While high greed can signal strong upward momentum, it can also indicate that the market might be overheated. Historically, periods of extreme greed are often followed by market corrections, making it a time for investors to exercise caution. How does Bitcoin dominance affect the index? Bitcoin dominance, which measures Bitcoin‚Äôs market share, is a key factor. A rising dominance can suggest investors are consolidating into Bitcoin, while a falling dominance might indicate a shift of capital into altcoins, both influencing overall market sentiment. Should I invest when the index shows ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô? The index is a sentiment tool, not an investment advisor. While ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô indicates optimism, it‚Äôs wise to be cautious. Consider rebalancing your portfolio, taking profits, and avoiding impulsive decisions driven by FOMO. Always conduct your own research.

Despite past rallies, retail sell-offs, weak technicals, and heavy whale dominance are holding DOGE back. Meanwhile, a new viral altcoin is rewriting the script, soaring 400% in just days. As investors chase real innovation and growth, Dogecoin may struggle to keep up in this new market cycle. Dogecoin Slides Again As Whales Keep Buying And Retail Keeps Selling Dogecoin is once again losing steam, dropping over 4% after last week‚Äôs brief 37% rally. The excitement that pushed DOGE higher has faded fast, and retail sentiment remains firmly on the sidelines. While whales continue to accumulate, with over 122 billion DOGE now in their hands, smaller holders are still offloading. Retail selling has persisted since early July, and new participants haven‚Äôt replaced the exit. This imbalance is weighing heavily on the price. Market data from Coinglass confirms the trend: trading volume is down nearly 47%, and open interest has dropped to $4.85 billion. Technicals paint a grim picture, too. DOGE trades below all major moving averages, including the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day, each reinforcing downward pressure. The MACD is deep in the red, and any small rally attempts are quickly overwhelmed by larger selloffs. Despite heavy whale support, DOGE continues to struggle with strong resistance levels and a lack of new retail enthusiasm. Analysts now question whether Dogecoin can ever realistically approach $1. It‚Äôs not just about memes anymore; market structure and momentum say otherwise. Without fresh retail demand and under consistent resistance, DOGE‚Äôs path to $1 is becoming harder to imagine. Meanwhile, a new altcoin is stealing the spotlight with a 400% surge, raising fresh questions about where retail energy is heading next. DeSoc Could Be The Viral Altcoin That DOGE Never Became While Dogecoin struggles to find upward momentum, a new altcoin is quietly building massive traction. DeSoc (SOCS) is capturing attention with its decentralized approach to social media, something traditional platforms have failed to deliver. A 2023 study found that 64% of Americans believe social media companies control the news too much. DeSoc takes this seriously, using blockchain to return control to users and protect their data. It‚Äôs not about memes or hype; it‚Äôs about transparency, fairness, and real utility. The team behind DeSoc has locked their tokens for two years and secured a 30-year liquidity lock, moves that signal a serious long-term vision and market stability. Unlike projects that focus solely on price action, DeSoc backs its mission with multiple security audits, with one already completed and more scheduled. This shows clear dedication to protecting investors and users alike. Its user-friendly design features customizable profiles, integrated wallets, and AI-powered content recommendations, all while safeguarding privacy. However, unlike Dogecoin, which has no real utility, DeSoc has a real-life use case. It is a platform where user ownership, the safety of data, and free speech are the primary concerns. With token distribution fully transparent and early access already generating buzz, DeSoc is shaping up to be the altcoin that doesn‚Äôt just ride a wave it builds one.

Meme coins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and PEPE are once again in focus‚Äîbut investors are starting to reassess where the real upside lies. In the midst of this shift, MAGACOIN FINANCE has caught the attention of high-level crypto traders, with some whales positioning early for what they believe could be a major 31x breakout. Meme Coins Are Back ‚Äì but for How Long? Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading around $0.00001220, while PEPE sits slightly lower at $0.00001046. Despite strong communities, both are struggling to regain momentum seen during previous bull runs. Dogecoin (DOGE), the original meme coin, is holding near $0.2044 but has shown signs of slowing down after a recent rally sparked by broader crypto gains. Many investors are now looking for fresh momentum plays‚Äîprojects that combine meme culture with real tokenomics, scalability, and long-term development. That‚Äôs where emerging altcoins are stepping into the spotlight. Why This Hidden Gem Is Drawing Whale Interest With capital flowing out of stagnant meme coins, MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming the go-to pick for investors looking ahead. Unlike projects stuck in hype cycles, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building an ecosystem that rewards early holders, offers deflationary mechanics, and has a clear roadmap backed by strong community engagement. Analysts are watching closely as whales enter during this early window, forecasting potentia l gains of 31x or more as retail demand begins to build. $500 invested now could realistically turn into $15,500 , according to current price projections‚Äîassuming similar momentum to other early-stage altcoin breakouts. What Comes Next for SHIB, PEPE, and DOGE? Shiba Inu‚Äôs ecosystem developments‚Äîincluding Shibarium‚Äîhaven‚Äôt yet moved the price significantly. PEPE remains highly volatile and speculative, with limited upside unless volume spikes drastically. Meanwhile, DOGE benefits from its name recognition, but many believe its days of 100x moves are behind it. That‚Äôs why investors are rotating into new territory, seeking smaller caps with bigger upside potential. Conclusion Altcoin season is in full swing, but the rules have changed. Traders aren‚Äôt just chasing hype‚Äîthey‚Äôre looking for what‚Äôs next. While SHIB, PEPE, and DOGE still hold nostalgia value, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are commanding attention for their growth potential and strategic entry points. With whales now circling and early backers projecting 31x gains , this could be the golden opportunity of the summer.

The cryptocurrency world is always in motion, and understanding its shifts is key to navigating its often-volatile waters. Recently, a significant indicator, the Altcoin Season Index , has captured the attention of many. This crucial metric, tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), recently registered a value of 36. This figure, down from previous days, signals a clear shift: the crypto market is currently experiencing what is known as Bitcoin Season . What Does the Altcoin Season Index Really Tell Us? The Altcoin Season Index is more than just a number; it is a snapshot of the broader cryptocurrency landscape. It helps investors understand whether altcoins (any cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin) are outperforming Bitcoin or vice versa. This index, which carefully excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens, compares the 90-day performance of the top 100 coins listed on CMC against Bitcoin. An index score ranging from 1 to 100. Altcoin Season : Occurs when at least 75% of the top 100 altcoins outperform Bitcoin over the past 90 days. Bitcoin Season : Indicated when 25% or fewer of these altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin. With the index now at 36, it strongly suggests that Bitcoin has been the dominant performer, leading the current market trends . Why Are We Seeing Bitcoin Season Now? The shift to Bitcoin Season is a natural part of the cryptocurrency cycle. Bitcoin often acts as a bellwether for the entire crypto market . When uncertainty rises or institutional interest focuses on established assets, capital tends to flow back into Bitcoin. This strengthens its position relative to altcoins. Several factors can contribute to this phenomenon: Market Stability Seeking : Investors often view Bitcoin as a safer haven during periods of high volatility or macroeconomic concerns. Dominance Cycle : Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements frequently dictate the overall direction of the market, influencing altcoin performance . Liquidity Concentration : Larger capital inflows often target Bitcoin first due to its superior liquidity and market capitalization. This dynamic often means that even if altcoins are seeing some gains, Bitcoin‚Äôs gains are comparatively larger, leading to a lower Altcoin Season Index . Navigating the Current Crypto Market: What Does This Mean for Your Portfolio? Understanding that we are in Bitcoin Season can help investors adjust their strategies. It is not necessarily a negative signal, but rather an indication of where current capital flows are concentrated. For many, this period might present different opportunities and challenges. Consider these actionable insights: Focus on Bitcoin : If your portfolio is heavily diversified into altcoins, this might be a time to re-evaluate your Bitcoin exposure. Strategic Altcoin Positioning : For those holding altcoins, research projects with strong fundamentals that might weather the Bitcoin Season better or be poised for future growth when the cycle shifts. Risk Management : Periods of Bitcoin dominance can sometimes precede broader market corrections for altcoins, making risk management even more crucial. Monitoring the Altcoin Season Index allows you to make informed decisions based on prevailing market trends . Looking Ahead: Will Altcoin Performance Rebound? The cryptocurrency market is cyclical, and periods of Bitcoin Season eventually give way to Altcoin Season , and vice-versa. While the current Altcoin Season Index suggests Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance, this does not mean altcoins are irrelevant. Historically, altcoins have shown incredible resilience and potential for significant gains once market sentiment shifts or specific narratives emerge. Factors that could signal a return to strong altcoin performance include: Sustained Bitcoin price stability or consolidation. Breakthroughs in specific altcoin projects or ecosystems (e.g., Layer 2 solutions, DeFi innovations). Increased retail investor interest spreading beyond Bitcoin. Keeping an eye on these broader market trends and technological advancements within the altcoin space is essential for long-term success. In conclusion, the Altcoin Season Index at 36 clearly indicates that the crypto market is currently in Bitcoin Season . This phase highlights Bitcoin‚Äôs current strength and influences altcoin performance . While it calls for a strategic approach to your portfolio, remember that market cycles are dynamic. Staying informed about these crucial market trends and understanding what drives them will empower you to make more confident decisions in the ever-evolving world of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index is a metric from CoinMarketCap that tracks whether altcoins (cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin) are outperforming Bitcoin over a 90-day period. It ranges from 1 to 100. Q2: How is Altcoin Season determined? Altcoin Season occurs when at least 75% of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. Q3: What does it mean to be in Bitcoin Season? Bitcoin Season means that Bitcoin has been the dominant performer. This happens when 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days, as indicated by the Altcoin Season Index. Q4: How does Bitcoin Season impact altcoin performance? During Bitcoin Season, altcoins generally see less significant gains compared to Bitcoin, or they may even decline in value relative to Bitcoin. Capital tends to flow more towards Bitcoin as investors seek stability or leadership from the largest cryptocurrency. Q5: Is Bitcoin Season a bad thing for crypto investors? Not necessarily. Bitcoin Season is a normal part of the crypto market cycle. It suggests where the current market strength lies. For investors, it can be a time to consolidate positions, re-evaluate risk, and strategically plan for future shifts back to altcoin dominance. Did you find this analysis helpful?

Market data from CoinGecko shows the total crypto market capitalization currently stands at approximately $3.79 trillion, representing a 0.4% decline in the last 24 hours. This pullback follows a period of uncertainty across major digital assets, with both Bitcoin and altcoins facing limited buying momentum despite periods of volatility. Analysts suggest that reduced market activity and fluctuations in leveraged trading positions are playing a significant role in current market behavior. Insights from Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges globally, highlight shifting trader sentiment as leverage levels decline while overall price movement remains subdued. These changes raise questions about whether the market is entering a phase of consolidation or setting up for more volatility ahead. Related Reading: Bitcoin Inflows To Binance Accelerate: Investor Behavior Shifts After Months Of Decline Leverage Trends on Binance Point to Market Reset According to a recent analysis from CryptoQuant contributor Arab Chain, leverage usage on Binance has decreased notably in recent days. The analyst explains that falling leverage is typically a short-term positive indicator as it suggests the exit of overleveraged traders and a reduction in forced liquidations. This can help stabilize price fluctuations and reduce abrupt sell-offs that often trigger sharp market corrections. However, Arab Chain points out that the current scenario differs slightly. Both price levels and leverage ratios have declined simultaneously, indicating that spot market buying has not picked up to offset selling activity. ‚ÄúThe lack of strong demand in the spot market weakens the probability of a rapid recovery,‚Äù the analyst wrote. This trend highlights a more cautious approach from traders, potentially reflecting macroeconomic uncertainties or a wait-and-see attitude ahead of key market developments. The estimated leverage ratio on Binance is considered a critical indicator for short-term sentiment. A high leverage ratio suggests speculative positions are dominating the market, making it more vulnerable to sudden price swings. Conversely, a falling ratio can indicate risk management among traders or widespread liquidations, both of which can temporarily ease volatility. Arab Chain emphasizes that this metric acts as an ‚Äúearly radar‚Äù for potential shifts in market momentum. Altcoin Deposits Signal Increased Trading Activity In a separate analysis, CryptoQuant‚Äôs Maartunn observed a significant increase in altcoin deposits to Binance, with a seven-day transaction count exceeding 45,000, the highest level since late 2024. This surge in activity coincided with Bitcoin‚Äôs recent push above $112,000, suggesting traders are preparing to adjust their positions across a wider range of digital assets. Deposits to exchanges are often interpreted as a signal of upcoming trading activity, as funds are moved from wallets to platforms where they can be quickly exchanged. Whether this results in increased buying or selling depends on how the broader market evolves in the coming days. The uptick in deposits could indicate growing interest in altcoins as traders look for opportunities beyond Bitcoin amid its recent stagnation.

A major player in the asset management space, Trivest Advisors, has made a substantial commitment to the digital asset market. This Hong Kong-based firm, which oversees an impressive $1.2 billion in assets, recently revealed a massive $90.4 million investment in BlackRock‚Äôs spot Bitcoin ETF, known by its ticker IBIT. This isn‚Äôt just a large sum; it‚Äôs a clear signal of growing confidence from established financial institutions in the world of digital assets. Such a significant move by Trivest Advisors underscores the increasing mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin and its associated investment vehicles, particularly the highly anticipated BlackRock Bitcoin ETF . A Pivotal Institutional Bitcoin Investment by Trivest Advisors This investment by Trivest Advisors isn‚Äôt just about the dollar amount; it signifies a strategic move. Their $90.4 million stake in BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT likely places them among the top 10 holders of the fund globally. This is a monumental step for institutional Bitcoin investment , as it demonstrates how traditional asset managers are actively integrating digital assets into their portfolios. Such a substantial commitment from a firm managing over a billion dollars sends a powerful message. It validates Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class for large-scale financial entities. This move could also inspire other hesitant institutional investors to consider similar allocations to spot Bitcoin ETFs. The Expanding Landscape of Spot Bitcoin ETF Adoption The launch of spot Bitcoin ETF products in the United States has truly transformed the cryptocurrency investment landscape. These funds offer a regulated and accessible pathway for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements without directly holding the cryptocurrency. Trivest Advisors‚Äô move highlights the accelerating trend of widespread spot Bitcoin ETF adoption. This surge in institutional interest reflects a growing understanding of Bitcoin‚Äôs potential. It also showcases the effectiveness of these ETF products in bridging the gap between traditional finance and the innovative world of digital currencies. The ease of access and regulatory oversight provided by these ETFs are key drivers behind this institutional influx. What Does This Mean for Crypto ETF Investment? Trivest Advisors‚Äô significant stake has broader implications for the entire crypto ETF investment sector. It indicates a maturing market where sophisticated investors are actively seeking exposure to digital assets through regulated products. This could lead to: Increased Liquidity: More institutional money flowing into ETFs generally enhances market liquidity. Price Stability: Greater institutional participation can contribute to more stable price discovery for Bitcoin. Broader Acceptance: Such investments pave the way for wider acceptance of cryptocurrencies in mainstream finance. While the benefits are clear, it‚Äôs also important to acknowledge that any crypto ETF investment still carries inherent market volatility. Investors should always conduct thorough research and understand the risks involved. Analyzing the Top Bitcoin ETF Holders The news about Trivest Advisors‚Äô investment naturally prompts questions about the current landscape of Bitcoin ETF holders . While exact real-time rankings can fluctuate, a $90.4 million stake positions Trivest Advisors as a significant player. This investment places them alongside other notable entities that have recognized the long-term value proposition of Bitcoin through the ETF structure.

49665982,549381,1754528416,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49665982.jpeg,Base Explains Network Disruption: Sequencer Glitch Led To 33-Minute Block Production Halt,https://bitcoinist.com/base-explains-network-disruption-33-minute-halt/,"Base, the Ethereum Layer-2 solution developed by Coinbase, experienced a 33-minute network disruption that halted block production on its Mainnet. The outage occurred on August 5, 2025, and was caused by unexpected on-chain congestion combined with an unprepared backup sequencer. While Base is designed with high availability in mind‚Äîfeaturing multiple sequencer instances managed by Conductor (an OP Stack component)‚Äîa critical handoff failure required manual intervention to resume operations. This event sparked immediate fear and speculation across the crypto community. Investors and users began to question the sustainability of the network, especially as Layer-2 scaling solutions are expected to offer seamless, reliable performance. The incident highlighted potential vulnerabilities in the sequencer infrastructure, casting doubt on whether Base can maintain uptime and stability during periods of high demand. As trust in the network was momentarily shaken, critics pointed to the risks of centralized sequencer management, while supporters emphasized that the quick response prevented a longer disruption. Nonetheless, the reputational impact has raised concerns for both institutional users and DeFi projects considering the network for deployment. The coming weeks will be critical as they address these concerns and work to restore confidence in the network. Base Outlines Root Cause And Fixes Network Outage Following the recent 33-minute network disruption, Base published a detailed postmortem report explaining the technical root cause and the mitigation steps taken to restore the network. The issue stemmed from a sequencer handoff failure within the system‚Äôs High Availability (HA) cluster, which is managed by Conductor, an OP Stack component designed to maintain uptime and minimize single points of failure. At 6:07am UTC, the active sequencer started lagging behind due to intense on-chain activity. Conductor, functioning as intended, initiated an automated handoff to a new sequencer. However, the new sequencer was still being provisioned and wasn‚Äôt yet ready to produce blocks. Typically, if a newly elected sequencer is unhealthy, Conductor would perform another handoff. Unfortunately, since Conductor wasn‚Äôt fully operational on this sequencer, it couldn‚Äôt initiate another transfer. By 6:09am UTC, monitoring systems flagged the issue, and the Base team was paged. At 6:12am UTC, the incident was officially declared. To mitigate the issue, Base engineers paused Conductor‚Äôs HA software to stop further faulty leadership transfers and manually elected a healthy sequencer. By 6:40am UTC, the network had resumed normal operations. To prevent future incidents, Base is working on updating its infrastructure to ensure that any sequencer added to the cluster is always capable of leadership transfer if elected. Additionally, the team is enhancing testing protocols to validate these fixes before deployment. These measures are aimed at bolstering Base‚Äôs system robustness and avoiding similar disruptions in the future. Ethereum Price Action Reflects Market Caution Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $3,611.52 after experiencing a sharp decline from its recent local high of $3,940. The price is struggling to regain bullish momentum, failing to hold above the $3,700 resistance zone. This chart shows that ETH has entered a consolidation phase after its aggressive rally from $2,852.16, which remains a key support level in case of further downside. The 50-day moving average (blue line) is acting as dynamic resistance around the $3,640 zone, while the 100-day (green line) and 200-day (red line) moving averages are still positioned below the price, reflecting a broader bullish trend. However, the recent rejection near the $3,860.80 level indicates that bulls are losing control in the short term. While Base itself doesn‚Äôt have a native token, its performance is closely tied to Ethereum‚Äôs Layer-2 ecosystem narrative. Investors are now watching closely to see if ETH can stabilize above $3,600, as any further weakness could amplify doubts about the broader L2 market.

Three names are making the loudest noise, Spartans.com, Stake.com, and Betway. Each follows a different plan. Stake builds buzz with ongoing prize pools, Betway offers steady seasonal free bet deals, and Spartans turns all the spotlight on a single grand prize, a Lamborghini, for one winner. For those chasing life-changing wins, the question is not only who offers the biggest prize, but also who offers the clearest way to get it. Here‚Äôs how these three heavyweights compare when ambition, clarity, and player experience go head-to-head. Spartans: Single-Prize Lamborghini Giveaway Grabs Big Attention Spartans has focused all its promotional effort on one major goal, awarding a Lamborghini to a single winner in a live-streamed finale. Unlike quiet prize draws or rotating offers, Spartans makes the entire process public and competitive. Entry is simple: sign up, deposit crypto, and opt into the Lamborghini Challenge. There are no complex missions or unclear rules. This direct style makes Spartans stand out in 2025‚Äôs big prize scene as one of the most confident operators. The pull is powerful. One grand prize creates more excitement than many smaller, hidden rewards. Every deposit feels like a step toward the spotlight. Both casual players and high-stakes users instantly understand the stakes and can‚Äôt ignore the outcome. In 2025, this is a clear example of a crypto giveaway designed to thrill rather than just keep people engaged. With instant withdrawals after the win, Spartans also sets a higher standard for trust and transparency, giving the campaign both credibility and maximum player impact. Stake.com: Constant Prizes Over One Big Spotlight Stake.com builds its giveaways around non-stop action. Players see weekly $50,000 raffles, leaderboard races, and rotating prize pools. The aim is simple, keep the activity flowing with plenty of chances to win. It‚Äôs a perfect fit for regular players who enjoy tracking many promos. Stake also fuels engagement through community live streams and influencer tie-ins. Still, while the total prize value is huge, the focus gets blurred. Rewards are shared among thousands or replaced so quickly that no single event stands out. For some, this means more chances. For others, it means less thrill. Against Spartans‚Äô single Lamborghini spotlight, Stake‚Äôs rewards lean more on loyalty than emotion. Strong in numbers, but lighter in lasting impact. Betway: Steady and Safe Rewards Betway takes a more traditional route, seasonal giveaways, boosted odds, and free bet draws. While not fully crypto-focused, some areas now allow digital currency play. Joining is easy: place a bet, earn an entry, and you could win credits, merchandise, or small cash amounts. This works for players who want stability over spectacle. But in a year when crypto gambling promos are getting bolder and more public, Betway‚Äôs approach feels careful. The prizes rarely hit the size that sparks major excitement, and the process blends in with the sportsbook‚Äôs regular flow. For those wanting easy bonuses, it‚Äôs fine. But compared to a Lamborghini or weekly six-figure pools, Betway‚Äôs style comes across as safe, but forgettable. Wrap Up The key difference in this contest is intent. Spartans is built to be remembered. The Lamborghini Challenge rewards and impresses in equal measure. It‚Äôs public, final, and impossible to mix up with a normal promo. Stake spreads its big rewards across too many winners to create one unforgettable moment. Betway stays in its comfort zone instead of pushing limits. Spartans wins not just on the size of the prize but on how it‚Äôs delivered, clear entry, tangible reward, and a finale set for all to see. This rare mix of openness and excitement makes it stand out among big prize sites. For players choosing where to play, Spartans tells the simplest story: no missions, no point systems, no tiers. Just one question, do you want the car? And for many, that clarity beats the noise of endless promos.

49666712,https://thecoinrise.com/cold-wallet-stuns-crypto-market-with-270m-deal-and-2m-users-pre-launch/,1754528437,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/49666712.jpeg,Cold Wallet Stuns Crypto Market With $270M Deal and 2M Users Pre-Launch!,https://thecoinrise.com/cold-wallet-stuns-crypto-market-with-270m-deal-and-2m-users-pre-launch/,"Crypto presales in 2025 are gaining momentum, but many are offering unfinished projects, lacking products, user bases, or any proof of delivery. Cold Wallet is the clear exception. It recently finalized a $270 million purchase, securing active infrastructure and a user base of more than 2 million, all before its official launch. This isn‚Äôt just a pitch on paper. Cold Wallet (CWT) is already functioning with tested systems and a built-in real-time cashback mechanism. It‚Äôs not preparing to look legitimate later. It‚Äôs already doing what others promise. In a market filled with vague blueprints, Cold Wallet stands out as one of the rare 2025 crypto presales showing actual results. A Bold $270M Acquisition That Changes the Game Where most presale projects are still seeking attention and building from the ground up, Cold Wallet made a strategic move with a $270 million acquisition. This deal brought the well-established Plus Wallet under its ownership, along with over 2 million active users. It wasn‚Äôt a marketing gimmick or token trade; it was a real purchase that redefined Cold Wallet‚Äôs standing. It‚Äôs not a small concept hoping to grow, it‚Äôs already equipped with the tools, tech, and user traction. For anyone reviewing crypto presales 2025, Cold Wallet isn‚Äôt forecasting what it might become; it‚Äôs building it already. Two Million Users Integrated Instantly With the Plus Wallet takeover, Cold Wallet didn‚Äôt just obtain software. It gained people. Over 2 million functioning wallets are now part of its system, with no long onboarding or transition delays. This scale of verified user migration is nearly unmatched among presales. While others rely on giveaways and referral campaigns, Cold Wallet now launches with one of the strongest user bases in the space. Each of these users adds power to the Cold Wallet ecosystem‚Äôs usage, demand, and pace. CWT isn‚Äôt merely a presale token; it powers an ecosystem that‚Äôs already running. Built on Working Systems, Not Empty Promises Cold Wallet also inherited a full-fledged operational backend and user interface through the acquisition. This matters. It allows Cold Wallet to release features quickly and without delays or broken promises. Core functions like wallet setup, gas tracking, fiat on-ramps, and multi-chain swaps aren‚Äôt goals; they‚Äôre already active features, thanks to the structure taken from Plus Wallet. Macro view of a screen of trading terminal with abstract financial graph and digits. Trading and forex concept. 3D Rendering Instead of starting at zero, Cold Wallet is accelerating a platform that already functions efficiently. Real Cashback That Rewards Activity Cold Wallet‚Äôs reward system isn‚Äôt an add-on. It‚Äôs central to the product. Users earn automatic cashback in CWT for performing tasks like swapping, transferring, or paying for gas. There are no complicated steps, staking requirements, or interfaces to navigate. The more CWT held, the higher the cashback tier, ranging from 10% up to 100%. This model directly connects platform usage to token demand. With millions of users arriving, that structure becomes even more valuable. Referral Program With Immediate Payouts Cold Wallet‚Äôs referral structure is designed to reward users upfront. Referrers earn USDT immediately, along with bonus CWT coins during the ongoing presale phase. There‚Äôs no post-launch delay or empty promises. It‚Äôs real-time value shared with those helping grow the network. This transforms Cold Wallet into a network-growing tool. Each referral not only boosts numbers but also enhances token circulation and reach. Cold Wallet‚Äôs Presale Numbers Surge Cold Wallet‚Äôs presale is still early, yet the progress is massive. The price in Stage 16 is set at $0.00942, while the listing price is projected at $0.3517. This indicates a gain potential of over 4,900%. So far, over 685 million CWT have been sold and the presale has brought in more than $5.7 million. This isn‚Äôt a case of searching for traction. Cold Wallet already has momentum and still offers entry at favorable terms. Why Cold Wallet Leads Among Crypto Presales 2025 Rather than making claims about future developments, Cold Wallet has already achieved key milestones. From securing a $270M platform and integrating 2 million users, to activating live systems and distributing real cashback, everything is already in motion. The referral rewards are live. The wallet features are deployed. The tech works and scales. There are no missing parts, only continued progress. Among all crypto presales 2025 , few are showing this level of readiness. Cold Wallet stands apart with real infrastructure, a solid user base, and a clear model linking utility to value. And with early presale stages still active, the entry point remains attractive for those following tangible success.

That‚Äôs why traders are zooming in on four high-upside contenders. This roundup highlights the top altcoin to watch right now, BlockDAG, Hyperliquid, Sui, and Binance Coin (BNB), each showing unique strength, big momentum, and solid structures behind the price action. BlockDAG is exploding with its $364M presale and tech-first ecosystem. Hyperliquid is proving structure matters, even at a premium. Sui thrives on volatility with a technical edge. And BNB? It‚Äôs holding strong with real-world adoption and institutional eyes watching. Whether you‚Äôre in it for quick flips or long-term gains, these four deserve a closer look. 1. BlockDAG: The Presale Powerhouse Turning Heads in Every Cycle When it comes to presales, few are making waves like BlockDAG (BDAG) . This project blends DAG architecture with Layer 1 scalability, setting it up to handle high volumes without the lag of older blockchains. That‚Äôs exactly why traders are flocking in, and why BlockDAG is the top altcoin to watch this season. The numbers are loud: $364 million raised, 24.8 billion BDAG coins sold, over 18,900 miners gone, and $7.7 million in hardware revenue. BDAG is priced at $0.0016 right now, while its listing is locked at $0.05. That‚Äôs a staggering 3,025% return sitting in plain sight. The 10 BTC Auction adds more fuel, every buyer gets a shot at winning Bitcoin. With this bonus and the price window closing by August 11, the energy around BDAG is real. Traders know it: this is one of the biggest shots to get in before liftoff. 2. Sui: Volatility-Driven & Timing-Obsessed Sui lives for volatility, and traders love it. Built with the Move programming language, it‚Äôs designed to give more control over digital ownership and speed. That draws in users who want performance without compromise. SUI reacts fast to market shifts, making it a prime target for tactical trades. Right now, it‚Äôs hovering at levels traders are eyeing for potential reentry. For anyone scanning for the top altcoin to watch during uncertain conditions, Sui delivers precision opportunities. It‚Äôs less about hype, more about execution, and the payoff can be real if the entry is right. 3. Hyperliquid: High Price, Strong Structure, Still on Radar Hyperliquid isn‚Äôt cheap, but it‚Äôs not backing down either. While many sit on the sidelines hoping for a dip, HYPE continues to show it‚Äôs built on solid foundations. The buzz comes from its role in the perpetual futures space, where speed, depth, and on-chain data are driving next-level platforms. Its infrastructure meets the needs of fast-moving markets while staying decentralized. For those waiting on bullish sentiment to return, Hyperliquid is the one to stalk. The price may not be perfect yet, but the structure is strong, and when it moves, it could move big. 4. BNB: Real Utility Meets Long-Term Power BNB is one of the few tokens that doesn‚Äôt just rely on speculation. As the fuel behind Binance Smart Chain, it powers trading, staking, and governance, putting it at the center of daily crypto activity. Despite market dips, BNB is holding near all-time highs. That kind of stability is turning heads at the institutional level. Talks of BNB-backed products, crypto funds, and new treasuries show just how deep the value runs. For traders playing the long game, BNB isn‚Äôt just an exchange token, it‚Äôs a foundation for serious growth. BDAG Takes the Lead in This Altcoin Race Each of these picks has something to offer, from Sui‚Äôs sharp moves to BNB‚Äôs consistent traction. Hyperliquid shows us why structure matters, even at high prices. But one project is hitting on all fronts: BlockDAG. Presale strength? Check. $364 million locked in. Real tools? Already live. Community momentum? Surging. BlockDAG isn‚Äôt waiting to prove itself, it‚Äôs doing it right now. For those aiming for big upside, solid tech, and a clear launch plan, this is the top altcoin to watch before the next phase begins. If you‚Äôre serious about catching the next breakout, don‚Äôt let this one pass you by.

The Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), operating under South Korea‚Äôs Financial Services Commission (FSC), has initiated a comprehensive study. This move highlights the nation‚Äôs commitment to creating a robust and secure environment for digital assets, particularly stablecoins, through proactive virtual asset legislation . Why is South Korea Stablecoin Regulation So Important? On August 6th, the FSC‚Äôs FIU commissioned a pivotal FSC stablecoin study . This initiative focuses on the second phase of virtual asset legislation and aims to establish clear anti-money laundering (AML) measures for stablecoins. This proactive approach is designed to integrate stablecoins into the existing financial framework, allowing their legitimate use for payments and cross-border transfers. The goal is to foster innovation while ensuring consumer protection and financial stability. By bringing stablecoins under a regulatory umbrella, South Korea seeks to mitigate risks associated with illicit activities and market volatility. This is a critical step for the broader adoption of digital currencies and strengthens South Korea stablecoin regulation efforts. What Does This Stablecoin Legislation Entail? The upcoming stablecoin legislation is not just about compliance; it‚Äôs about defining the future role of these digital assets.

Priced at $0.035, the new DeFi project has caught the eye of traders. investors who get in on phase 6 presale of MUTM will experience a 71.43% return on investment as the project goes live at $0.06. Mutuum Finance has now surpassed over $14.1 million and over 14,800 investors. Meanwhile, legacy tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE) continue to struggle with sideways momentum and lack of innovation, making way for utility-driven platforms like Mutuum to dominate headlines and investor interest. As capital rotates into more purpose-built DeFi ecosystems, the narrative this month belongs not to memecoins but to the rise of next-gen, use-case-backed assets like MUTM. Dogecoin (DOGE) Hovering Near $0.20 Amid Rotation Toward Utility-Driven Tokens Dogecoin is currently trading around $0.20, having pulled back roughly 4% in the past 24 hours and about 15% off its July peak of around $0.26‚Äì$0.27 as investor appetite shifts away from meme narratives. Despite whale accumulation, over 2‚ÄØbillion DOGE (~$400M) observed at $0.21 support levels, technical indicators like weakening RSI and flat volume suggest momentum is waning. Short-term resistance sits in the $0.23‚Äì$0.24 zone, while support levels around $0.20‚Äì$0.21 could determine DOGE‚Äôs next path. As capital begins rotating toward utility-driven DeFi platforms, emerging protocol narratives like Mutuum Finance are increasingly drawing investor focus. Mutuum Finance Launches Phase 6 of Token Presale Mutuum Finance has recently introduced Round 6 of its presale with tokens now live at $0.035, a 16.17% increase from the last round. The next price increase will take the token up by another 14.29% to $0.04, so members will now be able to make 71.43% when it finally goes live at $0.06. The presale itself has already garnered over 14,800 investors and raised over $14.1 million, demonstrating the belief that the market has placed on the potential of MUTM. Dual-Lending: Empowering Future-Proof DeFi Mutuum Finance adopts a twin-model approach of facilitating flexibility and efficacy in Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending models. Peer-to-Contract makes use of autonomous smart contracts that carry out the lending independently without any participation of human beings whatsoever. They have been designed to operate on dynamic rates in the market with an unpredictable rate of interest as guided by existing demand and supply of an in-real-time interest. Peer-to-Peer model reduces intermediaries and allows market to be in direct interaction with borrowers and lenders. Mutuum Finance Boosts Stability Focus Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will introduce a stablecoin to be USD-pegged on the Ethereum blockchain. It will be sound and secure investment product to remove risk and uncertainty that can be attributed to algorithmic stablecoins. The project is audited with a 95.0 trust score by Certik. That is a key milestone as much as Mutuum Finance‚Äôs goal is to become an institutional-grade and transparent DeFi protocol. That also shows that the team is proud to be industry security standards-compliant. Mutuum Finance Deploys $50K Bug Bounty to Strengthen Protocol Security Mutuum Finance has initiated its Bug Bounty Program with the reward pool value of $50,000 USDT. There are four severity levels in the program. They include critical, major, minor, and low. All the probable bugs are hence found and rewarded. It is in line with the vision of the team to establish a secure, open, and quality DeFi protocol. As Dogecoin stalls near $0.20 with little to show in terms of innovation, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining momentum fast. The project has already raised over $14.1 million and attracted 14,800+ investors, signaling strong market confidence. Investors joining Phase 6 at $0.035 can lock in a 71.43% return when the token launches at $0.06. With a dual-lending system, USD-pegged stablecoin in development, CertiK audit, and $50K bug bounty, MUTM is proving it‚Äôs more than hype, it‚Äôs built for long-term growth. Join the presale before the next price increase hits.

The launch of its second-generation smartphone has captured the attention of both crypto investors and mobile tech enthusiasts. Meanwhile, early investors looking for the next big opportunity are also watching MAGACOIN FINANCE, a project gaining serious traction during its early stage with massive upside projections. Seeker Smartphone: A Web3 Powerhouse in Your Pocket Solana Mobile has begun shipping its new crypto-focused smartphone, the Seeker, to over 50 countries worldwide. With more than 150,000 units pre-ordered, it‚Äôs already outpacing the original Saga phone, which sold just 20,000. Retailing at $450‚Äì$500, the Seeker is expected to bring in at least $67.5 million in revenue. But what truly sets the Seeker apart is its deep integration with blockchain tools. It includes a hardware-isolated Seed Vault for securely storing private keys and recovery phrases, along with a decentralized app store that bypasses Apple and Google‚Äôs restrictive frameworks. This opens up direct access to NFTs, DeFi, games, and dApps‚Äîall without the usual 30% commissions or app store bans. New Contender Could Outperform Even Solana‚Äôs Gains While Solana is generating buzz with real-world products, MAGACOIN FINANCE is turning heads with numbers. With analysts forecasting up to 14,500% returns from its current stage, it‚Äôs quickly becoming one of the most talked-about altcoins of the year . As access tightens and allocations vanish, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing comparisons to early-stage SHIB and DOGE‚Äîbut with a more advanced ecosystem in development. For those entering before major exchange listings, the potential could be enormous. Is $500 SOL a Realistic Target? The buzz around the Seeker has added fresh fuel to Solana‚Äôs price outlook . Already showing strength amid altcoin rotation, SOL could ride the wave of mobile adoption to new highs. Analysts point to key ecosystem metrics‚ÄîDeFi TVL, NFT activity, and user growth‚Äîas signs of continued strength. If momentum holds, a run to $500 is within reach, especially considering the anticipation of spot ETF approval. Conclusion The Seeker‚Äôs launch marks a major step forward for crypto-native mobile tech, and Solana is leading the charge. But while SOL‚Äôs climb to $500 is drawing speculation, some investors are placing their bets on MAGACOIN FINANCE for even bigger returns . With limited access remaining and bold ROI projections , this might be the altcoin to watch as the next bull run unfolds.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Bitcoin (BTC) is treading water around $115K Thursday morning in Asia, up 1% in the last 24 hours, as the post-all-time-high correction continues to play out across low volume and weak conviction. According to Glassnode , BTC has entered what it calls an ‚Äúair gap‚Äù, a low-liquidity zone between $110,000 and $116,000, after breaking down from a major supply cluster where short-term holders had previously found support. These areas typically see little trading activity and can either serve as a base for accumulation or become a trapdoor for deeper downside if demand fails to return. ‚ÄúThe market is effectively re-finding its footing,‚Äù Glassnode analysts wrote, describing the range between $110K (the prior ATH) and $116K (recent buyer cost basis) as the new battleground. They noted that while opportunistic buying has emerged, with 120,000 BTC acquired on the dip, prices have yet to reclaim resistance levels convincingly, particularly the ~$116.9K threshold that marks recent short-term holder entry points. Short-term holder profitability has dropped from 100% to 70%, which Glassnode frames as typical for a bull market mid-phase. But without fresh inflows, this could quickly erode sentiment. ETF flows have turned negative, with a -1.5K BTC outflow earlier this week, the largest since April. At the same time, funding rates in the derivatives market have cooled, reflecting reduced leverage and a more cautious stance among speculators. Market maker Enflux offered a similar take: ‚ÄúCrypto markets remain in a fragile holding pattern. Despite some relief in the altcoin space, majors like BTC and ETH are still struggling to inspire confidence,‚Äù it wrote in a client note. ‚ÄúThe broader trend? Heavy legs with more or less light volume.‚Äù ETH is up 2% in the last 24 hours, trading just below $3,600. The CoinDesk 20 Index , which tracks a broad basket of crypto assets, gained 1.69% to 3,815.22. ‚ÄúUntil BTC and ETH reclaim strength with volume,‚Äù Enflux added, ‚Äúthe path of least resistance could remain sideways to down.‚Äù The market‚Äôs next move likely hinges on whether buyers are willing to step in and build a base within this low-volume zone, or whether another flush toward $110K is needed to reset the trend. For now, traders remain cautious, and the bulls remain unproven. Market Movers: BTC: A potential Bitcoin supply shock, driven by drying OTC desk reserves and steady corporate accumulation, could ‚Äúuncork‚Äù BTC price action after a dip below $110K, market observers say. ETH: Ethereum may have formed a local top as sell pressure hits $419 million, its second-highest on record, while ETH retests a major resistance zone near $4,000 that preceded a 66% drop in late 2024, raising the risk of a 25‚Äì35% decline by September; meanwhile, Polymarket bettors remain split, with 48% backing a rally to $5,000 despite the bearish signals. Gold: Gold's rally stalled Wednesday as traders took profits and weighed rising Fed rate cut odds, U.S. trade tensions, and a looming Fed leadership shakeup, leaving prices flat after a three-day gain driven by economic weakness; spot gold last traded at $3,372.11, down 0.24% on the day. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets opened mixed Thursday, with Japan‚Äôs Nikkei 225 flat, as investors shrugged off new U.S. semiconductor tariff threats. S&P 500: U.S. stock futures were flat Wednesday night as traders digested Trump‚Äôs new semiconductor tariffs, with the S&P 500 still up 1.7% for the week.

Economists and markets widely anticipate a 25 basis point cut , maintaining the central bank‚Äôs current once-per-quarter pace of monetary easing. The decision will be announced at 12 p.m. in London, followed by a press conference with Governor Andrew Bailey at 12:30 p.m. The rate cut would mark the fifth consecutive quarter-point reduction, bringing UK rates below those of the U.S. Federal Reserve, which last moved in 2024 and currently holds its benchmark at 4.25%‚Äì4.5%. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is expected to stick with its cautious guidance of ‚Äúgradual and careful‚Äù reductions, as inflation pressures re-emerge. June inflation came in at 3.6%, higher than the bank‚Äôs 3.4% forecast and its highest reading in 17 months, driven by surging energy and food prices. The BoE may now revise its near-term inflation outlook closer to 4% for the year. Governor Bailey has downplayed the spike as temporary, but Chief Economist Huw Pill and others have warned of second-round effects feeding into wages and core inflation. BoE faces mounting growth risks as job losses soar Meanwhile, growth concerns have intensified following back-to-back contractions in the spring and rising unemployment tied to April‚Äôs payroll tax and minimum wage hikes. More than 180,000 jobs have been lost since Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced a ¬£26 billion increase in employer national insurance contributions, pushing the unemployment rate to a four-year high. The MPC is expected to highlight these labour market challenges in its updated projections. In May, it forecast growth of 1% in 2025 and 1.25% in 2026, though recent data suggests a potential upward revision after better-than-expected Q1 performance and an upgraded estimate for Q2 growth. The decision is likely to expose divisions within the nine-member MPC. A Bloomberg survey suggests a three-way split: most members favouring a 25bp cut, two pushing for a larger 50bp move, and two likely to vote for no change. Pill and external member Catherine Mann, who opposed cuts in May, are expected to maintain their stance, while Swati Dhingra and Alan Taylor may advocate for a more aggressive reduction. While today‚Äôs move is mostly priced in, traders will be watching closely for any change in forward guidance. Markets expect one more cut this year, likely in November, bringing the rate down to around 3.5% by 2026. ‚ÄúThe risks are tilted in a hawkish direction,‚Äù said Dan Hanson, Chief UK Economist at Bloomberg Economics. ‚ÄúThe committee may signal it‚Äôs rethinking its once-a-quarter pace, implying a November cut isn‚Äôt guaranteed.‚Äù BoE reconsiders bond sales strategy as long-dated gilt yields surge Attention is also turning to the BoE‚Äôs balance sheet reduction strategy. Quantitative tightening (QT) has already reduced bond holdings by about ¬£100 billion annually, but market strain‚Äîespecially in long-dated gilts‚Äîhas sparked speculation that the BoE could slow or shift the pace of sales. Governor Bailey has recently flagged concerns over rising 30-year gilt yields, reaching levels last seen in the late 1990s. A pivot toward shorter-dated debt or a reduced pace of active sales (currently expected at ¬£26 billion a year) may be under consideration ahead of the BoE‚Äôs September QT update. According to Sanjay Raja, Chief UK Economist at Deutsche Bank, a signal acknowledging long-end liquidity issues could foreshadow changes in the BoE‚Äôs sales strategy.

During a podcast appearance this week, Long was openly skeptical of the¬†company behind XRP. She alleged that the company had fallen short of its initial mission, replacing traditional banking, specifically the SWIFT network. Although on top of this, she also claimed that Ripple‚Äôs past had ‚Äúall the makings‚Äù of an initial coin offering (ICO) and argued why Ripple would be releasing a new stablecoin on Ethereum rather than entirely through the XRP Ledger. Schwartz quickly took to social media, particularly X, dispelled the misinformation, and offered further engagement. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm available whenever you want to chat about the facts about Ripple, our stablecoin RLUSD, the XRP Ledger, and its native token XRP.‚Äù He wrote . Schwartz also directed readers to a detailed post by XRPL validator @Vet_X0, which ‚Äúsets the record straight‚Äù and is a useful entry point for anyone seeking factual information. XRPL validator rejects ‚ÄòICO‚Äô allegations The validator, Vet ( @Vet_X0 ), strongly rejected Caitlin Long‚Äôs characterization of XRP as the result of an initial coin offering (ICO). He said she appeared to lack a clear understanding of the subject, yet spoke about it confidently. Vet explained that Ripple did not raise funds through an ICO. Instead, when the XRP Ledger launched in 2012, the entire supply of 100 billion XRP tokens was placed in a genesis account. At that time, the tokens had no monetary value and no public sale or capital raise. This counters Long‚Äôs claim that XRP‚Äôs origins are comparable to projects like Ethereum, which conducted a well-documented public ICO in 2014, raising funds in Bitcoin to distribute ETH to early backers. Vet also had a beef with Long claiming not once, but twice, that Ripple essentially centralizes the XRP Ledger. Vet said Long‚Äôs comments were either ignorance or technical illiteracy. He said that XRP Ledger is open-source and decentralized, and that anyone could run a validator or fork the code. Currently, the XRPL hosts over 1,000 nodes and over 100 active validators, many of which are controlled by independent individuals, universities, businesses, and financial institutions, not Ripple. Ripple said it does not own these validators and can‚Äôt update the network unaided. Ripple expands RLUSD to both Ethereum and XRPL Caitlin Long is concerned that the choice made by Ripple to launch its RLUSD stablecoin on Ethereum contradicts its original vision of using the XRP Ledger as the backbone of global finance. She suggested switching to Ethereum might mean Ripple isn‚Äôt trusting in its infrastructure. XRPL validator Vet replied that RLUSD was to be issued on Ethereum and the XRP Ledger as a deliberate multi-chain strategy. He stressed that this isn‚Äôt a move away from XRPL but rather a pragmatic attempt to enhance liquidity and target a more diverse audience across other blockchain ecosystems. According to Vet, Ripple Payments and RLUSD continue to operate natively on the XRP Ledger, and Ethereum‚Äôs involvement merely complements‚Äînot replaces‚Äîthe network‚Äôs capabilities. Vet also took the opportunity to spotlight XRPL‚Äôs long-standing technical leadership. He noted that the XRP Ledger was the first blockchain to embed a decentralized exchange (DEX) directly into its protocol. It also pioneered native tokenization, enabling users to issue custom assets without relying on smart contracts. Development on the XRP Ledger, Vet stressed, has never stagnated. Its amendment system continually adds new features based on community consensus. He described the ecosystem as vibrant, supported by a growing developer base, strong liquidity, and deeper connections to real-world finance, which are further strengthened with the rollout of RLUSD.

As of today, ETH trades at approximately $3,598, reflecting a 1% decrease in the past 24 hours. This pullback follows months of mixed price action across the market, as traders balance optimism over long-term fundamentals with short-term risk management. New insights from on-chain data suggest heightened market activity surrounding Ethereum despite its failure to reclaim the $4,000 mark. Analysts point to unprecedented levels of Open Interest (OI) in Ethereum futures contracts, combined with record daily transactions on its network. While this signals growing participation and network adoption, it also raises concerns about potential volatility if market sentiment shifts abruptly. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Falters Above $3,700 ‚Äì Is a Pullback Brewing? Ethereum Open Interest Hits All-Time High CryptoQuant analyst CryptoOnchain reported that Ethereum‚Äôs OI on Binance has recently reached a record-breaking $77 billion. Open Interest measures the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, providing insight into market activity and trader participation. The surge suggests that more capital is entering ETH futures markets, potentially setting the stage for significant price movements. This rise in OI coincides with Ethereum reaching its highest daily transaction count ever recorded. Analysts link this spike in activity to increased engagement in decentralized finance (DeFi), growth in layer-2 scaling solutions, and broader adoption of Ethereum-based applications. CryptoOnchain noted that such developments ‚Äúhighlight growing participation and user engagement,‚Äù adding that this type of market buildup often precedes sharp price trends, either upward or downward. However, this accumulation of leveraged positions carries risk. If price movements turn unfavorable for the majority of open contracts, a wave of liquidations could occur, amplifying volatility. This has been a recurring theme in the cryptocurrency market, where leveraged positions can trigger cascading sell-offs during sudden price corrections. Bearish Signals Emerge from Market Order Activity Another CryptoQuant analyst, Maartunn, highlighted a different indicator that reflects short-term market pressure on Ethereum. According to his data, Net Taker Volume for ETH stood at -$418.8 million daily. This figure represents roughly 115,400 more ETH sold via market orders than bought, indicating a clear imbalance in favor of sellers. Market orders, unlike limit orders, execute trades immediately at the best available price. A sustained negative Net Taker Volume often signals urgency among sellers, potentially foreshadowing further downside if buy-side demand fails to absorb the selling pressure. Maartunn explained that ‚Äúsuch behavior indicates participants were willing to prioritize execution speed over price,‚Äù typically a bearish market sign.

In a high-level meeting with Vice President Gibran Rakabuming Raka‚Äôs office, representatives from Bitcoin Indonesia presented a detailed proposal outlining how the country could use surplus renewable energy to mine and accumulate Bitcoin as part of a long-term economic development plan. Indonesian Bitcoin (BTC) Reserve Move Despite stringent crypto tax policies and a nationwide ban on using crypto for payments, Indonesian officials are reportedly receptive to the idea of a Bitcoin reserve for the economy. A key component of the discussion involved the importance of public education, with Bitcoin Indonesia advocating for awareness programs to improve understanding of Bitcoin‚Äôs economic potential. The group also shared macroeconomic projections, including Michael Saylor‚Äôs bullish forecast of Bitcoin reaching $13 million by 2045. With a stable inflation rate of 0.76% and a debt-to-GDP ratio of just 39%, Indonesia‚Äôs interest in Bitcoin is not driven by economic desperation but rather by a strategic vision to diversify its reserves and leverage untapped geothermal and hydroelectric energy for sustainable mining. Brazil Moves Forward with Crypto Reserve Legislation While Indonesia explores its options, Brazil is already advancing a national conversation on Bitcoin reserves . The country‚Äôs House of Representatives is scheduled to hold a public hearing on August 20 to debate a bill that could allow up to 5% of its treasury, approximately $15 billion, to be allocated to Bitcoin. Six key institutions, including Brazil‚Äôs central bank and finance ministry, will participate in the discussions. Though the bill faces opposition from some financial authorities, Vice President Geraldo Alckmin‚Äôs office has endorsed it as being in the national interest. This marks Brazil‚Äôs first-ever public hearing on crypto reserves and underscores a growing global shift toward the institutionalization of Bitcoin. A Global Trend Toward Sovereign Bitcoin Holdings Indonesia and Brazil join a growing list of nations, including the United States, Ukraine, Bhutan, and Kazakhstan, that are actively exploring Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. While motivations vary, from hedging against inflation to modernizing financial infrastructure, the trend is clear: sovereign Bitcoin reserves are no longer a fringe idea. As more governments assess the potential of digital assets, Bitcoin‚Äôs role in national economic strategies appears poised to grow significantly, signaling a transformative era in global finance.

XRP is gaining renewed interest as traders adjust positions following news of the ETF delay. Stellar recently led the charts after a breakout rally, briefly pushing past major altcoins. While these price moves get coverage, the real opportunity may lie in platforms offering lasting utility and active user rewards. Cold Wallet is gaining traction on that front. Now in Stage 16 of its presale at just $0.00942, it combines self-custody, real-world utility, and up to 100% cashback. With a launch price set at $0.3517, it gives users a 3,600% return potential. Over 682.8 million coins have already been sold. Rather than hype-based movement, Cold Wallet ($CWT) offers a working system that delivers value daily. It‚Äôs shifting focus from price watching to actual use. XRP‚Äôs Price Slips as ETF Delay Shifts Focus Elsewhere XRP‚Äôs price saw a burst of activity earlier this month, but the momentum didn‚Äôt last. The delay in launching the inverse XRP ETF until August 4, 2025, cooled off the rally. Prices briefly spiked to $0.52 before slipping back below $0.50, signaling a dip in short-term confidence. For now, XRP‚Äôs next moves depend more on regulation than innovation. XRP still holds recognition in the crypto space, but its growth is now tied to external decisions. Without strong internal developments or fresh updates, many traders are pausing. Interest is shifting to platforms that offer benefits based on user engagement rather than news. Cold Wallet stands out for this reason. While XRP‚Äôs future depends on ETF rulings, Cold Wallet is already a rewarding activity. With cashback and clear usage incentives, it offers a dependable alternative. It‚Äôs building steady traction, powered not by speculation but by function. As users look for projects offering more than just headlines, Cold Wallet is making its way to the top. Stellar Slows Down After Brief Rally Fails to Hold Stellar made waves with a massive 63% rally over the past week, briefly outperforming many other altcoins. The run was fueled by renewed interest in Stellar‚Äôs role in remittance services and increased trade volumes. However, the rally ran into resistance as prices neared $0.13. Now, many see the coin entering a sideways consolidation phase, suggesting that the move may have peaked. Even with fast transaction times and low fees, Stellar‚Äôs offerings no longer feel unique in today‚Äôs Layer 1 space. Without major changes or upgrades, it risks fading from attention. The excitement around Stellar‚Äôs rise may weaken unless backed by deeper ecosystem growth. Cold Wallet, on the other hand, doesn‚Äôt depend on price spikes. It rewards every transaction through cashback tiers. This utility-first model continues working even during sideways markets. While Stellar stalls, Cold Wallet gives active users a reason to stay engaged and earn with every action. Cold Wallet Turns Daily Crypto Use Into Cashback and 50x Returns Cold Wallet fixes one of crypto‚Äôs biggest problems, transaction fees that punish users for staying active. Most platforms take value from the user, especially on swaps, gas fees, or fiat ramps. Cold Wallet reverses that idea. Every action within the app earns $CWT, the utility coin that powers its cashback model. At Stage 16 of presale, it‚Äôs priced at $0.00942. The launch value is fixed at $0.3517, creating a return of 3,600% for early supporters. But the appeal isn‚Äôt just upside. Cold Wallet gives users a direct way to earn on activity. Holding more $CWT unlocks greater cashback rewards, up to 100%. No staking. No lock-ins. Just use the platform and earn. It includes four loyalty tiers: Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Diamond. Top-tier users receive full gas refunds and 50% cashback on swap and ramp fees. This system benefits people who actually use the wallet daily, not just large holders waiting on price moves. More than 682.8 million coins have already been sold, and the project has raised $5.6 million. With referral rewards that give both sides something and cashback that activates without delay, Cold Wallet is building a model centered on value returned to the user. It isn‚Äôt a wallet you just store crypto in, it‚Äôs one that works for you every day. Cold Wallet Brings Practical Value While Others Wait As XRP‚Äôs progress stalls due to delayed ETF news and Stellar‚Äôs rally hits resistance, Cold Wallet is quietly building something more sustainable. It rewards users for actual activity, not just holding. With a 3,600% ROI opportunity, cashback on fees, and over 682.8 million coins sold, it‚Äôs already proving itself. Cold Wallet doesn‚Äôt rely on speculation or external triggers. Its model puts value back in users‚Äô hands, creating daily utility that works across all market conditions. While other platforms wait for catalysts, Cold Wallet continues gaining traction through function, making it one of the most practical and promising presale crypto plays today.

(MHT), a company listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE). This massive acquisition, facilitated through a share purchase agreement with metallurgical company RIZAP Group, Inc., positions Bakkt as the largest shareholder of MHT. Incorporating Bitcoin Into MHT‚Äôs Treasury Management Plans As announced on Wednesday, part of this transaction will see Phillip Lord, the President of Bakkt International, assume the role of Chief Executive Officer at MHT. Under his leadership, MHT plans to incorporate Bitcoin (BTC) and other digital assets into its treasury management strategy. Furthermore, Bakkt has secured the domain name www.bitcoin.jp , which, pending approval from MarushoHotta‚Äôs shareholders, is set to become the new identity for the company. In a statement, Akshay Naheta, co-CEO of Bakkt, expressed enthusiasm for the opportunity, citing Japan‚Äôs regulatory environment as a favorable landscape for developing a Bitcoin-centric business model. He emphasized the intention to collaborate closely with MHT‚Äôs team to seamlessly integrate Bitcoin into their operational and financial framework , aiming to establish MHT as a foremost Bitcoin treasury company: Japan‚Äôs regulatory environment creates an ideal platform for a Bitcoin-centered growth business. We look forward to working with MHT‚Äôs team to integrate Bitcoin into their operating and financial model and to establish MHT as a leading Bitcoin treasury company. Bakkt Faces Setbacks As Stock Drops This acquisition aligns with Bakkt‚Äôs broader strategy to enhance its Bitcoin holdings. Recently, the company announced plans to raise up to $1 billion through various securities offerings, a move that reflects a growing trend among publicly traded companies to bolster their cryptocurrency reserves. The proposed offering includes shares of Class A common stock and pre-funded warrants, with underwriters being given a 30-day option to purchase an additional 15% of the shares sold, allowing for potential over-allotments. However, the timing, size, and terms of the offering remain contingent on market conditions. Despite these ambitious initiatives, Bakkt has encountered challenges. In March 2025, the company‚Äôs stock, BKKT , experienced a significant drop of 30% following news that two major clients, including Bank of America, would not be renewing their financial agreements with Bakkt. As of this writing, BKKT‚Äôs valuation closed Wednesday‚Äôs trading session at $9.77, up 2.5% for the day. However, the stock is trading over 70% below this year‚Äôs high of $31. Looking at a longer time frame, BKKT reached a record high of $1,271 in November 2021, which is nearly a 100% gap, further highlighting the firm‚Äôs challenges in recent years.

Meanwhile, the US is making significant progress toward its mission of becoming the crypto capital of the world. Despite this ambitious plan, concerns about potential capital flight are reportedly hindering the rapid advancement of stablecoin technology within the country. China Explores Stablecoin Initiatives According to a report from the Financial Times, Hong Kong has emerged as a testing ground for cryptocurrency, particularly given the strict bans on the mainland. Recently, the territory passed legislation allowing licensed businesses to issue tokens backed by any fiat currency. However, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has taken a cautious stance, indicating that only a limited number of licenses will be issued starting next year. Related Reading: Bitcoin Insult Alert: Pro Trader Dubs HODLers ‚ÄòIdiots,‚Äô Saylor Fires Back Policymakers in China have increasingly turned their attention to stablecoins, recognizing the growing dominance of dollar-backed tokens in the global economy. The central bank governor, Pan Gongsheng, noted in a June speech that stablecoins have ‚Äúfundamentally reshaped the traditional payment landscape.‚Äù However, the Chinese government faces a delicate balancing act; while it seeks to enhance the global standing of the renminbi, it must also maintain stringent controls over its financial system. Recent discussions among financial regulators have centered on the implementation of stablecoin projects, emphasizing that any such initiative must align with China‚Äôs unique national conditions. Yet, experts have cautioned that the risks associated with capital outflows could pose significant challenges. Interest Grows In Hong Kong Rebecca Liao, CEO of Saga, a company focused on blockchain infrastructure, articulated the complexities of adopting stablecoin technology, highlighting that it cannot be completely controlled by central authorities. This concern has contributed to Hong Kong‚Äôs slower progress in developing a thriving stablecoin market, especially when compared to the rapid growth observed in the United States. The HKMA has voiced apprehensions about the potential use of stablecoins in money laundering, emphasizing the need for stability and control in its new regulatory framework. As such, initial stablecoin programs in Hong Kong are expected to focus on business-to-business applications, limiting their broader adoption. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Bull Run In Jeopardy? Expert Reveals Strategy‚Äôs Alleged Plan To Sell All BTC Holdings The report emphasizes that interest in stablecoins is also growing among Chinese state-owned enterprises, particularly in the context of payment and settlement solutions. Multiple state-owned companies with operations in Hong Kong are reportedly looking to apply for stablecoin licenses, although only one of China‚Äôs four major state-owned banks is expected to receive a license from the HKMA in this initial phase. The HKMA has not ruled out the possibility of approving licenses for stablecoins backed by offshore renminbi, a move that could further facilitate cross-border payments‚Äîan area of increasing importance for China.

With Ripple‚Äôs banking initiative nearing launch and a potential XRP ETF approval looming, the crypto landscape is primed for movement. Seasoned traders know that dips often present the best buying opportunities‚Äîespecially when paired with strong catalysts. Among the altcoins gaining attention, MAGACOIN FINANCE has quietly emerged as a sleeper pick . Still in its presale stage, this low-cap project is drawing early comparisons to top performers from previous cycles. XRP‚Äôs ETF Catalyst and Bank License Fuel Buying Interest XRP has been regaining momentum as Ripple inches closer to resolving its long-running legal standoff with the U.S. SEC. A $50 million settlement is reportedly in the works, which would clear the path for institutional XRP sales. More significantly, rumors of an XRP ETF filing by BlackRock and other asset managers are ramping up. At the same time, Ripple‚Äôs push to secure a banking license is being viewed as a game-changing move. Analysts believe these developments could send XRP back toward the $3 range, with any ETF approval likely triggering a major rally akin to the Bitcoin ETF surge earlier this year. The Altcoin that Draws Early Whales Before Major Listings While large caps like XRP and ADA attract institutional buzz, MAGACOIN FINANCE is making waves in the high-ROI altcoin space. Currently in presale, the project has already recorded explosive early growth, with analysts projecting a potential 25x return if momentum continues. The MAGACOIN ecosystem is designed to blend meme coin virality with real-world utility, offering a hybrid approach that‚Äôs drawing strong community support. Investors are rushing to secure presale allocations before listings begin, citing similarities to early-stage PEPE and Shiba Inu‚Äîwith a more strategic roadmap in place. ADA Still Trading Far Below All-Time Highs‚ÄîBut Not for Long Cardano (ADA) has seen relatively quiet price action, but under the surface, excitement is building. The upcoming Midnight airdrop‚Äîa privacy-focused sidechain‚Äîis driving renewed interest in ADA holders. Historically, major network developments like this have preceded price rallies. Despite past underperformance compared to other top ten assets, ADA remains well below its all-time high near $3. Given its current positioning, any surge in usage or airdrop speculation could unlock a strong recovery, making ADA a solid mid-cap hold during this dip. Conclusion Market pullbacks often separate the emotional traders from the strategic ones. With XRP nearing a resolution, ADA gearing up for airdrop momentum, and MAGACOIN FINANCE blazing through its early stages with explosive projections , this dip may not last long. The smart money is already positioning.

A significant wave of Ethereum accumulation is underway, with institutional players and corporate treasuries making substantial moves into the ETH market. This trend signals a maturing digital asset landscape and could have profound implications for the future of the second-largest cryptocurrency. What‚Äôs Driving This Significant Spot ETH ETFs & Treasury Inflow? Nate Geraci, the respected president of NovaDius Wealth Management (formerly The ETF Store), recently shared compelling data on X. His report highlights a remarkable trend: since early June, companies holding Ethereum in their treasuries and newly emerging spot ETH ETFs have each acquired approximately 1.6% of the total Ethereum supply. This combined effort represents a staggering 3.2% of all ETH. Such a substantial absorption of tokens by these entities is a strong indicator of growing institutional confidence. It also suggests a long-term investment perspective rather than speculative trading. This steady inflow points to a strategic move by major players to secure a significant portion of the network‚Äôs native asset. It reflects a belief in Ethereum‚Äôs foundational technology and its potential for future growth. The Impact on ETH Supply and Market Dynamics When large entities like corporate treasuries and exchange-traded funds start buying up a significant percentage of an asset, it naturally impacts the available ETH supply . Here‚Äôs why this matters: Reduced Circulating Supply: As more ETH moves into long-term holdings and ETF reserves, less of it is available for day-to-day trading on exchanges. Potential Price Pressure: A reduced supply, coupled with sustained demand, can create upward pressure on Ethereum‚Äôs price over time. This is a fundamental economic principle. Market Validation: Institutional buying provides a strong vote of confidence. It validates Ethereum as a legitimate and valuable asset class, attracting further investment from traditional finance. This ongoing accumulation acts as a powerful signal to the broader market. It suggests that major financial players are increasingly comfortable allocating capital to digital assets, especially those with strong utility like Ethereum. Who Are These Ethereum Treasuries and Why Does It Matter? The term ‚Äò Ethereum treasuries ‚Äò refers to companies that hold ETH as part of their corporate reserves, similar to how they might hold cash, gold, or other traditional assets. This practice has gained traction as more businesses recognize the potential of blockchain technology and decentralized finance. Why is this significant? Diversification: Companies are diversifying their balance sheets with digital assets. Strategic Alignment: For many, holding ETH aligns with their business strategies, particularly those involved in Web3, NFTs, or DeFi. Long-Term Horizon: These are typically not short-term speculative plays but rather long-term strategic investments, implying a belief in Ethereum‚Äôs enduring value. The emergence of spot ETH ETFs also provides a regulated and accessible pathway for traditional investors to gain exposure to Ethereum without directly owning the cryptocurrency. This bridges the gap between traditional finance and the crypto market. The Future of Institutional Ethereum Investment: What‚Äôs Next? The recent surge in institutional Ethereum accumulation, highlighted by Nate Geraci‚Äôs report, paints a clear picture: major financial players are taking Ethereum seriously. This trend is likely to continue as regulatory clarity improves and more traditional investment vehicles become available. What can we expect going forward? Continued ETF Growth: As more spot ETH ETFs launch globally, they will likely continue to absorb a significant portion of the available supply. Broader Corporate Adoption: More companies may follow suit, adding ETH to their balance sheets as a hedge against inflation or as a strategic asset. Increased Market Stability: Large, long-term institutional holdings can contribute to greater market stability by reducing volatility often associated with retail speculation. This systematic accumulation by well-funded entities underscores Ethereum‚Äôs evolving role from a niche digital asset to a recognized, investable asset class within the global financial system. It‚Äôs a testament to the network‚Äôs robust ecosystem and its potential for widespread adoption. Conclusion: A New Era for Ethereum The collective efforts of spot ETH ETFs and corporate treasuries to acquire 3.2% of the total ETH supply since June mark a pivotal moment for Ethereum. This significant Ethereum accumulation by institutional players signals a profound shift in how traditional finance views and engages with digital assets. As more of the ETH supply is locked away in long-term holdings, the stage is set for a future where institutional Ethereum plays an even more dominant role in shaping the market. This ongoing trend not only validates Ethereum‚Äôs position but also paves the way for greater stability and mainstream integration. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Ethereum accumulation by treasuries and spot ETH ETFs? Ethereum accumulation by treasuries refers to companies holding ETH as part of their corporate balance sheets. Spot ETH ETFs are investment funds that hold actual Ethereum, allowing traditional investors to gain exposure without directly buying and storing the cryptocurrency. Both are actively acquiring significant amounts of ETH. Q2: How much of the total ETH supply has been acquired by these entities since June? According to Nate Geraci‚Äôs report, corporate treasuries and spot ETH ETFs have each acquired approximately 1.6% of the total ETH supply, leading to a combined Ethereum accumulation of roughly 3.2%. Q3: What impact does this accumulation have on the overall ETH supply? This significant accumulation reduces the amount of ETH supply available on exchanges for trading. This can lead to increased scarcity, potentially putting upward pressure on Ethereum‚Äôs price if demand remains strong or grows. Q4: Why are companies adding Ethereum to their treasuries? Companies are adding Ethereum to their Ethereum treasuries for various reasons, including diversification of assets, strategic alignment with Web3 or blockchain initiatives, and as a long-term investment believing in Ethereum‚Äôs future growth and utility. Q5: Does this institutional interest mean Ethereum is becoming more stable? Yes, the increasing involvement of institutional Ethereum investors, particularly those with long-term holding strategies, can contribute to greater market stability. Their large, less volatile holdings can help cushion price swings often associated with retail trading. Did you find this article insightful?

This technical retest comes as institutional momentum heats up: Satsuma Technology just raised $218 million in BTC-denominated funding, adding to a broader wave of long-term capital moving into Bitcoin. With higher lows forming since April and major players like pension funds and SBI Holdings expanding crypto exposure, the setup for a breakout toward $123K is becoming harder to ignore. Satsuma‚Äôs Bold Bitcoin Bet London-based Satsuma Technology has made headlines with a $217.6 million convertible credit note , the first of its kind in the UK to be fully subscribed in Bitcoin. This funding round, backed by Pantera Capital, Kraken, Blockchain.com, and UK asset managers overseeing more than ¬£300 billion, outperformed its target by 63%. JUST IN: Satsuma Technology raises $217.6M to expand Bitcoin treasury strategy. pic.twitter.com/t0bFAv80Qy ‚Äî ChainDesk (@ChainDesk_) August 6, 2025 Despite the positive momentum, Satsuma‚Äôs stock slipped 14%, a move analysts attribute to profit-taking and short-term volatility. CEO Henry Elder confirmed the capital will support their plan to fuse decentralized AI infrastructure via Bittensor with a Bitcoin-native treasury strategy. Currently holding 1,126 BTC at an average entry of $115,149, Satsuma‚Äôs position is nearly break-even, reflecting firm conviction in Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term trajectory amid broader market turbulence. The raise aligns with a growing macro trend: $7.8 billion in crypto asset acquisitions were disclosed last week, with $2.7 billion flowing into Bitcoin alone. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technical Setup Points to Breakout Bitcoin is showing notable technical strength. Price action around $114,980 is consolidating just above two key supports: The 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $112,860 Long-term ascending trendline stretching back to April. This confluence zone, where resistance has flipped into support, is often a bullish continuation signal. Bitcoin Price Chart ‚Äì Source: Tradingview RSI is about to cross above 50, which could be the start of the bullish momentum. The chart shows a broad ascending triangle with higher lows and accumulation below $123,206. A break above this level could unleash the buyers towards $131,337 and $138,680. If the trendline holds, it‚Äôs a stair-step rally. But if it breaks below $111,995 it could shift the sentiment and open the door for a drop to $105,225 or $99,500. Volume confirmation and a bullish engulfing candle above $115,000 would be the perfect entry for swing traders. BTC Trade Setup (Short-Term): Entry: Break above $115,000 Targets: $123,200 Stop-Loss: Below $113,800 If this triangle breakout confirms, bulls could regain control, especially if paired with renewed institutional inflows and ETF stability. Institutions Double Down on BTC In the U.S., the Michigan State Retirement System just tripled its Bitcoin ETF exposure, adding 200,000 shares of the ARK 21Shares BTC ETF to its portfolio, now valued at $11.4 million. This comes despite over $1.4 billion in outflows across U.S. ETFs last week, signaling long-term conviction. Michigan also holds $13.6 million in Grayscale‚Äôs Ethereum Trust , unchanged since 2024. Though crypto remains a small slice of its $19.3 billion portfolio, analysts say the Sharpe ratio for Bitcoin is increasingly attractive for pension strategies seeking asymmetric returns with manageable risk. Michigan State Pension Triples Bitcoin ETF Exposure, Latest Filing Shows ‚ñ∫ https://t.co/kllKdIYnpZ https://t.co/kllKdIYnpZ ‚Äî Decrypt (@DecryptMedia) August 6, 2025 Across the Pacific, Japan‚Äôs SBI Holdings is awaiting approval for the country‚Äôs first Bitcoin-XRP ETF. If greenlit, it would be listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange ‚Äî unlocking institutional access in a tightly regulated market. A second ETF, blending gold and crypto, is also in the pipeline. These developments could dramatically boost Asian inflows, especially if Japan‚Äôs Financial Services Agency reclassifies crypto under the FIEA statute ‚Äî a shift that could redefine institutional access across the region. What‚Äôs Next for BTC? With BTC holding support near $115K and institutional narratives strengthening across the U.S., U.K., and Japan, the foundation is set for a bullish continuation. If the ascending triangle plays out, Bitcoin could break through $123K resistance and revisit $131K or $138K in the near term and possibly set the stage for a Q4 run toward $250K or higher.

After a period of quiet, US spot Bitcoin ETFs have made a significant comeback. On August 6, these investment vehicles collectively saw a substantial net inflow of $91.52 million. This positive shift is particularly noteworthy as it broke a five-day streak of net outflows, signaling renewed investor confidence in the digital asset space and specifically in spot Bitcoin investment products. What Drove the Recent Bitcoin ETF Inflows? The latest data, shared by crypto analyst Trader T on X, paints a clear picture of this encouraging trend. The $91.52 million in total net inflows marks a decisive turn for Bitcoin ETF inflows . This isn‚Äôt just a small bump; it‚Äôs a significant indicator that institutional and retail interest in Bitcoin exposure through regulated channels is regaining momentum. BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT led the pack, attracting a robust $41.9 million in inflows. Bitwise‚Äôs BITB followed closely, securing $26.35 million. Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC , despite its higher fees, managed to pull in $14.5 million. Fidelity‚Äôs FBTC added $10.06 million to its coffers. VanEck‚Äôs HODL contributed with $4.08 million in inflows. Interestingly, not all funds experienced inflows. ARK Invest‚Äôs ARKB saw a net outflow of $5.37 million on the same day. However, the overall picture remains overwhelmingly positive, with the majority of major players showing strong net gains. Understanding BTC ETF Performance: A Closer Look This surge in inflows for US spot Bitcoin ETFs highlights a critical aspect of the evolving cryptocurrency market: the growing acceptance and integration of digital assets into traditional finance. Spot Bitcoin ETFs allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements without directly holding the cryptocurrency. This convenience and regulatory oversight are key attractions for a broad range of investors, from large institutions to individual traders. The daily flow data provides a real-time pulse of market sentiment. When funds like BlackRock and Fidelity, major players in traditional finance, see consistent inflows, it suggests a broader shift towards embracing Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. This positive BTC ETF performance can also influence broader market sentiment for Bitcoin itself, potentially leading to increased price stability or even upward momentum. What‚Äôs Next for Crypto ETF Trends? The August 6th inflows offer a glimmer of optimism, but what does this mean for future crypto ETF trends ? While one day‚Äôs data doesn‚Äôt establish a long-term pattern, it certainly provides a hopeful sign. Investors and analysts will be closely watching subsequent days‚Äô performance to see if this trend of net inflows continues or if it was an isolated event. Continued inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs could indicate: Increased Institutional Adoption: More institutions might be allocating capital to Bitcoin through these regulated products. Renewed Retail Interest: Individual investors, perhaps waiting for clearer market signals, might be re-entering the market. Market Maturity: The consistent use of ETFs suggests the market is maturing and becoming more accessible. However, it is important to remember that the crypto market remains volatile. External economic factors, regulatory news, and broader market sentiment can all impact these flows. Monitoring these trends is crucial for anyone involved in digital asset investment. Conclusion: A Positive Shift for Spot Bitcoin Investment The $91.52 million net inflow into US spot Bitcoin ETFs on August 6 is a welcome development for the cryptocurrency ecosystem. It marks an end to a period of outflows and showcases renewed confidence from investors across various funds. While the journey of digital assets in traditional finance is still unfolding, this positive turn in Bitcoin ETF inflows is a strong indicator of growing interest and potential stability for the market. It underscores the increasing importance of regulated investment products in making Bitcoin accessible to a wider audience, paving the way for further mainstream adoption. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a US spot Bitcoin ETF? A US spot Bitcoin ETF is an exchange-traded fund that directly holds Bitcoin. It allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements without having to buy and store the cryptocurrency themselves. These funds trade on traditional stock exchanges. Why are net inflows into Bitcoin ETFs important? Net inflows indicate that more money is entering these funds than leaving them. This suggests increasing investor demand and confidence in Bitcoin as an asset class, particularly through regulated investment vehicles. It can also be a positive sign for Bitcoin‚Äôs price. Which US spot Bitcoin ETFs saw the most inflows on August 6? On August 6, BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT led with $41.9 million in inflows, followed by Bitwise‚Äôs BITB ($26.35 million), Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC ($14.5 million), Fidelity‚Äôs FBTC ($10.06 million), and VanEck‚Äôs HODL ($4.08 million). Do all Bitcoin ETFs experience inflows? No, not all Bitcoin ETFs experience inflows simultaneously. On August 6, for example, ARK Invest‚Äôs ARKB saw net outflows. Fund performance can vary based on investor preference, fees, and specific fund strategies. How do Bitcoin ETF inflows impact the broader crypto market? Significant and sustained inflows into Bitcoin ETFs can signal growing institutional and retail interest, potentially leading to increased liquidity, greater price stability, and overall positive sentiment for Bitcoin and the wider cryptocurrency market.

Recently, U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs witnessed a remarkable influx of capital, with a combined net inflow of $34.15 million on August 6. This significant event marks the second consecutive trading day of positive flows, signaling growing investor confidence in Ethereum-backed financial products. This trend highlights a crucial shift in how traditional investors are engaging with the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. What‚Äôs Driving These Ethereum ETF Inflows? This impressive surge in Ethereum ETF inflows didn‚Äôt happen by chance. Data shared by Trader T reveals that key players are actively accumulating positions. Leading the charge was BlackRock‚Äôs ETHA, which alone attracted a substantial $32.41 million in inflows. This demonstrates strong institutional appetite for regulated crypto exposure. BlackRock‚Äôs ETHA: Dominant with $32.41 million in inflows. Grayscale‚Äôs ETHE: Added $10.04 million, showing continued interest in established products. ARK 21Shares‚Äô CETH: Contributed $0.37 million, rounding out the positive contributors. However, it wasn‚Äôt universally positive. Grayscale‚Äôs mini ETH experienced a net outflow of $8.67 million. This suggests some investors might be reallocating within their Ethereum holdings or optimizing their exposure strategies. Other ETFs reported no change in their holdings for the day, maintaining a steady stance. Understanding the Impact on ETH ETF Performance The consistent positive flow, particularly the second consecutive day of net inflows, is a strong indicator of robust ETH ETF performance . It reflects increasing comfort among institutional and retail investors with regulated vehicles for accessing Ethereum‚Äôs potential. This trend can lead to greater market stability and broader acceptance of digital assets. Why is this important? When large investment firms like BlackRock see significant inflows into their products, it often validates the underlying asset. For Ethereum, this means more capital is being directly channeled into its ecosystem, potentially boosting liquidity and market cap over time. It also signifies a maturing market where traditional finance is increasingly intertwined with decentralized technologies. How Do These Inflows Affect the Broader Crypto ETF Market? The success of U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs has ripple effects across the entire crypto ETF market . Positive performance in one segment, especially a major one like Ethereum, often inspires confidence in other digital asset products. This can pave the way for more diverse crypto ETF offerings in the future, expanding options for investors seeking exposure to various cryptocurrencies without direct ownership. This institutional embrace through ETFs helps bridge the gap between traditional finance and the volatile crypto world. It provides a regulated, accessible pathway for a wider range of investors, from large funds to individual retirement accounts, to participate in the growth of digital assets. This legitimization is crucial for the long-term health and expansion of the crypto market. The Future of Digital Asset Investment Looks Bright These recent inflows underscore a growing appetite for digital asset investment . The ability to invest in Ethereum through regulated ETF products offers significant advantages, including ease of access, liquidity, and oversight. As the market matures, we can expect to see continued innovation in financial products that cater to diverse investor needs. The transparency provided by ETF structures also builds trust. Investors can track holdings and performance easily, fostering a more informed and secure investment environment. This positive momentum for U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs could be a precursor to even greater institutional adoption and innovation in the broader digital asset space. In conclusion, the substantial $34.15 million in net inflows into U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs on August 6 marks a pivotal moment. Led by BlackRock, this trend signifies robust institutional confidence and a maturing market for digital asset investments. It‚Äôs a clear signal that Ethereum, through its ETF vehicles, is firmly establishing its place in mainstream finance, promising an exciting future for the crypto market.

In 2023, only 3% of respondents reported receiving any part of their salary in crypto. That figure jumped to 9.6% in 2024, as blockchain-native firms and DAOs increasingly turned to stablecoins and tokens to compensate employees and contributors. At the same time, the share of workers paid exclusively in fiat dropped from 97% to 89.1%. This shift shows a broader willingness among companies to integrate digital assets into day-to-day operations, particularly in roles that span borders or operate within decentralized ecosystems. Stablecoins Become Standard for Crypto Wages, USDC in Front Among those receiving crypto compensation, USDC was the dominant choice. The dollar-pegged stablecoin accounted for 63% of all crypto salaries, far outpacing USDT , which held a 28.6% share. Other tokens like Solana and Ethereum made up a smaller slice, with 1.9% and 1.3%, respectively. Our mission is to support the long-term success of both our portfolio companies and the broader crypto ecosystem. One major gap we‚Äôve consistently seen? Reliable, transparent compensation data for crypto teams. That‚Äôs why we created our annual Crypto Compensation Survey ‚Äì a‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Pantera Capital (@PanteraCapital) August 6, 2025 Pantera‚Äôs survey covers blockchain engineers, product managers, legal and operations staff across the industry. The results suggest that stablecoins are no longer limited to trading pairs or DeFi use cases, but are also becoming a practical tool for payroll and international payments. USDC Adoption in Payroll Strengthened by Monthly Reserve Disclosures Crypto compensation offers several advantages, especially for globally distributed teams. Stablecoins enable faster settlement times, lower transaction fees and easier access to US dollar value in regions with banking restrictions or currency instability. The findings also point to growing confidence in USDC‚Äôs reputation for regulatory compliance and transparency, particularly after Circle, its issuer, began publishing detailed monthly reserve reports and secured access to US Treasuries. More Workers Opt to Split Salaries Between Cash and Crypto While full salary payments in crypto remain uncommon, hybrid arrangements are gaining traction. Many firms now allow employees to split their compensation between fiat and digital assets, giving workers the option to dollar-cost average into crypto markets or spend directly using Web3 wallets. Pantera‚Äôs report did not disclose regional trends, but the surge in crypto salaries is likely driven in part by Asia-based teams and contractors who rely on stablecoins for cost-effective cross-border payments. The rise of on-chain compensation also comes as more crypto-native companies formalize operations. With better treasury management tools, real-time payroll rails and accounting platforms tailored for digital assets, the logistical barriers to paying in crypto are beginning to fall.

This major move by an address linked to James Wo, founder of the crypto venture capital firm DFG, has caught the attention of many, especially given the staggering crypto whale profit involved. This transaction highlights the dynamic nature of digital asset markets and the substantial gains possible for long-term holders. Unpacking the Massive James Wo ETH Sale: What Happened? An address believed to belong to James Wo has offloaded all its Ethereum holdings, marking a substantial transaction. Over the past two days, a total of 3,634.2 ETH, valued at approximately $13.29 million, found its way to Binance Exchange. This particular stash of Ethereum was accumulated back in February 2023, with an average acquisition cost of $1521.95 per ETH. The timing of this extensive James Wo ETH sale is notable, occurring after more than two years of holding these assets. This strategic divestment has resulted in an estimated profit of $7.796 million, a truly remarkable gain from their initial Ethereum holdings . Such a move by a prominent figure often sparks widespread discussion within the crypto community. The Role of On-Chain Analysis in Uncovering Major Moves How do we know about such large-scale transactions? This information comes to light thanks to meticulous on-chain analysis . Experts like @ai_9684xtpa on X actively monitor blockchain data, tracking the movement of significant cryptocurrency amounts. This transparency is a core feature of public blockchains, allowing anyone with the right tools to observe transactions. On-chain data provides invaluable insights into market trends, potential whale movements, and shifts in investor sentiment. It helps the community understand where large amounts of digital assets are moving and who might be behind those movements, even if identities are presumed rather than explicitly confirmed.

In July 2025, the blockchain payments giant filed for a charter to launch Ripple National Trust Bank, a limited-purpose national trust bank headquartered in New York. The goal: provide enterprise-grade custody, tokenization infrastructure, and stablecoin management‚Äîwithout operating as a traditional deposit-taking bank. The move includes a request for a Federal Reserve Master Account, which would allow Ripple to directly access the U.S. payment system for settlement, a leap forward in integrating crypto into traditional banking. While the bank is still awaiting final regulatory approval, the announcement has already reignited market speculation, particularly around Ripple‚Äôs native token XRP and major assets like Ethereum. Meanwhile, early-stage altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE are catching tailwinds from the broader surge in institutional interest. XRP Testing Key Levels as Market Eyes $3.69 Currently trading between $3.03 and $3.07, XRP recently broke out of a downward channel but is now facing resistance at $3.14 and $3.34. Technical analysts note that a clean breakout above $3.34 could trigger a move toward $3.69 or even higher, particularly if regulatory clarity continues to improve. Ripple‚Äôs proposed bank could accelerate XRP adoption by boosting institutional trust. With a dedicated infrastructure for safeguarding reserves, managing RLUSD (Ripple‚Äôs stablecoin), and facilitating cross-border payments, XRP could find itself at the center of a more regulated and scalable payment system. The bullish scenario? A legal victory combined with a banking license approval‚Äîtwo catalysts that could launch XRP toward new highs. Ethereum Approaches $4,000 as Bulls Take Control Ethereum is trading strong between $3,555 and $3,720. After gaining more than 40% in the past month, ETH is showing resilience amid broader market volatility. Key resistance lies at $3,881 and $4,234, and analysts remain bullish provided ETH continues to defend the $3,400 range. Ethereum stands to benefit indirectly from Ripple‚Äôs banking play as well, given the broader legitimization of tokenized infrastructure and blockchain-integrated banking services. With ETH‚Äôs growing presence in tokenized treasuries, stablecoins, and DeFi infrastructure, any movement toward regulatory clarity tends to strengthen Ethereum‚Äôs investment case. Momentum with Fresh Capital Rotation into Breakout Contenders Ripple‚Äôs growing institutional influence is prompting early investors to explore the next big opportunity‚Äîespecially among projects still in presale. That shift has brought major attention to MAGACOIN FINANCE, which has recently experienced a surge in whale inflows and early staking momentum. Ripple‚Äôs Trust Bank Launch Could Fuel MAGACOIN FINANCE 22,500% Gains‚ÄîOutpacing XRP Projections , according to some analysts. The project is riding the wave of rising institutional appetite with a meme-fueled narrative, early timing, and strategic accumulation that‚Äôs beginning to resemble early DOGE and SHIBA cycles. Investors seeking asymmetrical upside are watching MAGACOIN FINANCE closely as ETF-driven inflows trickle down to presale markets. Conclusion: Ripple‚Äôs Banking Play Sets the Stage Ripple‚Äôs National Trust Bank proposal isn‚Äôt just another crypto headline‚Äîit‚Äôs a signal that blockchain is entering Wall Street‚Äôs core financial architecture. If approved, it could catapult XRP and ETH to new heights‚Äîand in doing so, may fuel a new generation of breakout altcoins. MAGACOIN FINANCE is already capturing that energy, one wallet at a time.

Cardano (ADA) is holding strong near its support zone with slight upside, while Pi Coin (PI) is making headlines through wallet updates aimed at access and usability. Both show movement, but neither offers early access to real market tools or previews of in-action utilities. BlockDAG stands out. Using the TRADEBDAG code, buyers unlock a live trading simulator that mirrors real presale activity. This isn‚Äôt about future plans, it‚Äôs a hands-on experience now, giving users a better sense of what to expect post-launch. Among trending crypto coins, BlockDAG ‚Äôs utility-first approach clearly breaks the mold and brings more engagement early on. BlockDAG‚Äôs Live Simulator Previews Market Action! Most early-stage crypto projects rely on promises. BlockDAG flips the script. The TRADEBDAG code gives full access to its Trading Dashboard, a real-time simulator that previews actual BDAG trading post-launch. Users can view BDAG/USD price charts, track the live order book, and place trades that update wallet balances instantly. It brings a working prototype to users‚Äô hands now. This tool isn‚Äôt just about trying it out. It allows participants to build trading confidence and understand real market behavior before the official launch. The goal is to shift the presale from passive holding to full user interaction, which makes the experience more exciting and rewarding. BlockDAG‚Äôs GLOBAL LAUNCH release makes this more exciting. Although the current Batch 29 price is $0.0276, buyers can use the special GLOBAL LAUNCH rate of $0.0016 until August 11. This opens a potential 3,025% return, based on the confirmed $0.05 launch price. So far, $361 million has been raised, with over 24.7 billion coins sold. Batch 1 buyers have already seen a 2,660% ROI. As the presale momentum continues, BlockDAG proves it isn‚Äôt just selling a future idea. It‚Äôs showing exactly what‚Äôs coming next and why it matters for early access users. Pi Wallet Improves Access With Fiat Options A new Pi Wallet update is drawing fresh attention to Pi Coin (PI), especially with features designed to improve access. The wallet now supports payments through Apple Pay, Google Pay, and debit cards via Banxa and Onramper. This lowers the entry barrier and makes it easier for users to buy PI with fiat. The update also added a ‚ÄúBUY‚Äù button, streamlining user experience and hinting at broader adoption goals. There are also signs that the wallet may support other digital assets soon, which would give it a role beyond the Pi ecosystem. That could reshape how users interact with it long term. Together, these upgrades highlight a broader shift in PI‚Äôs direction. The team is clearly focused on improving access, building infrastructure, and supporting mainstream use. While exchange listings are still pending, the current updates help PI stay visible among trending crypto picks that focus on usability and interface experience. ADA Bounces Back From $0.69 Support Cardano (ADA) dropped from $0.83 to nearly $0.69 between July 28 and August 2, showing six straight days of red candles. This drop tested the long-standing $0.69 support level and caught traders‚Äô attention due to its consistent decline. Since then, ADA has recovered with two green sessions and now trades close to $0.73. ADA is currently stuck inside a multi-year symmetrical triangle. Analysts are watching the $0.72 to $0.73 range as a key breakout zone. If ADA moves higher, it could touch $0.75 or even $0.80 soon. Under the right conditions, some targets stretch as far as $0.96 by the end of August. Despite recent pressure, ADA‚Äôs ability to hold support has caught attention. It remains one of the top coins with long-term upside as traders track potential breakout levels, especially while larger altcoins move sideways or struggle to reclaim momentum. The Bottom Line Pi Coin (PI) is gaining users through wallet updates. Cardano (ADA) is holding its ground at support. But neither gives access to real-time trading before the next phase or lets users test anything ahead of listings. BlockDAG does. The TRADEBDAG code unlocks full use of its Trading Dashboard, where buyers can view price charts, place trades, and see wallet balances shift live. It‚Äôs not just testing, it‚Äôs real-time simulation based on current presale activity, which provides early training and excitement. For those looking at top crypto coins right now, BlockDAG offers a working product, not just future potential. With its $0.0016 GLOBAL LAUNCH release valid till August 11, BlockDAG puts real tools and opportunity directly in users‚Äô hands, turning curiosity into real engagement before market listings go live.

49671163,549656,1754535656,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49671163.jpeg,Worldcoin in the Spotlight Again as China Warns of Biometric Data Threats,https://bitcoinist.com/worldcoin-in-spotlight-again-china-warns-biometric/,"China‚Äôs Ministry of State Security (MSS) has raised alarms over a foreign company‚Äôs (likely Worldcoin) collection of biometric data from users in exchange for cryptocurrency rewards, calling the practice a potential threat to both individual privacy and national security. The warning, published Wednesday on the agency‚Äôs official WeChat account, pointed to documented cases of large-scale iris data collection linked to crypto token distributions . While the MSS did not explicitly name the project, the description closely aligns with Worldcoin, a project developed by Tools for Humanity. Worldcoin has gained attention for using its ‚Äúorb‚Äù devices to scan users‚Äô irises to create unique digital IDs and distribute its cryptocurrency token, WLD. According to the MSS, the transfer of these sensitive data sources to external entities ‚Äúposes risks not only to personal privacy but also to the country‚Äôs national security,‚Äù as biometric information can potentially be exploited beyond its stated purpose. Growing Global Scrutiny of Biometric Crypto Projects China‚Äôs warning adds to mounting global scrutiny over biometric data collection in the digital asset industry. Worldcoin, launched in 2023, has faced investigations and regulatory actions in multiple jurisdictions, primarily over concerns surrounding data protection and user consent. In May, Indonesian authorities suspended the project‚Äôs operating permit following reports of irregularities related to Worldcoin‚Äôs identity verification services. Tools for Humanity later stated that World voluntarily paused its proof-of-personhood operations in Indonesia while seeking clarity on licensing requirements . This is not the first time China has voiced concerns about crypto-linked risks. The country has long maintained strict policies on digital asset trading and initial coin offerings (ICOs), emphasizing consumer protection and financial stability. Last month, Shenzhen‚Äôs financial regulator issued an alert warning citizens about fraudulent schemes disguised as stablecoin investments. The MSS statement expands the scope of concern, highlighting how biometric data collection linked to crypto incentives can cross into national security territory, particularly if foreign entities manage or store sensitive information. Implications for Privacy and Regulation in the Crypto Space The latest development reflects a broader debate around privacy, identity verification, and decentralized finance. Projects like Worldcoin argue that iris scans enable a secure and scalable method of proving human identity online, which could help distinguish real users from automated bots in Web3 applications. Critics, however, have cautioned that once biometric data is collected, the risk of misuse or unauthorized access remains high, even if encrypted or anonymized. China‚Äôs public statement suggests that the country may increase oversight of foreign crypto projects operating within its jurisdiction or collecting data from Chinese nationals. This aligns with global regulatory trends, where authorities are seeking to strike a balance between technological innovation and the protection of sensitive personal information. In Europe, data regulators have opened probes into Worldcoin‚Äôs activities under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), while Kenya temporarily halted Worldcoin registrations over similar privacy concerns in 2023. The MSS has urged the public to exercise caution when approached with offers to exchange personal data for cryptocurrency rewards.

Some analysts suggest that the cryptocurrency is preparing for a massive rally. Related Reading: Solana To Drop Before The ‚ÄòReal Move‚Äô? Analyst Forecasts New Highs In Q3 Cardano Retests Key Resistance Following last week‚Äôs drop to the $0.70 support, Cardano is attempting to break out of a crucial resistance level to continue its rally. The cryptocurrency has surged 8.8% from Friday‚Äôs low, retesting the $0.74-$0.76 area throughout this week. Notably, ADA has been hovering between the $0.65-$0.85 price range since the Q2 market recovery, briefly losing this area during the June pullback. However, the July market pump sent the altcoin to a four-month high of $0.93, sparking bullish sentiment among investors. Since then, Cardano has been in a downtrend, attempting to break out of the descending resistance for the past two weeks. Market watcher Sebastian noted that the cryptocurrency has repeatedly retested the $0.76 zone over the past few days, suggesting that ‚Äúthe more it tests it, the higher the likelihood to break it.‚Äù According to the analyst, ADA must reclaim the 50-day Moving Average (MA), which has served as a strong resistance and support level and coincides with the descending resistance breakout area. Following today‚Äôs performance, the altcoin has reclaimed the 50 MA indicator and eyes a retest of the $0.76 resistance. A breakout from this level would set the stage for a retest of the next crucial area between $0.79 and $0.80. ‚ÄúGetting back above $0.80 would confirm the trend reversal,‚Äù Sebastian affirmed. Meanwhile, a rejection from this area could propel Cardano to retest the recent lows and risk losing its local range again. ADA Breakout Eyes 85%-120% Rally Man of Bitcoin noted ADA‚Äôs recent performance, asserting that it is ‚Äúnow potentially working on a small 1-2 setup.‚Äù Based on this, he suggested that ‚Äúas long as the price remains above the last swing low at $0.685, wave-5 of iii should follow next.‚Äù Meanwhile, analyst Ali Martinez highlighted that the cryptocurrency has been trading within a descending channel since its December 2024 high of $1.32. According to the chart, ADA retested the channel‚Äôs upper boundary for the first time in months during the July breakout but was ultimately rejected. Reclaiming the $0.76 could propel the altcoin to the channel‚Äôs resistance, and ‚Äúa breakout above $0.84 could set Cardano on a path toward $1.30.‚Äù Additionally, Martinez asserted that ‚ÄúADA is showing the same price structure as the last cycle, only this time, it‚Äôs unfolding more gradually. And it feels like we‚Äôre right at the beginning of an explosive move.‚Äù Similarly, Crypto Bullet stated that Cardano has been following a pattern over this cycle. Per the chart, the cryptocurrency has been trading down for months before breaking out and reaching new local highs. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin‚Äôs Price Discovery Rally Over? This Week‚Äôs Performance May Hold The Answer Last month, the cryptocurrency broke out of its eight-month downtrend, targeting a rally toward the $1.60 area.

As of this writing, Cardano is trading at $0.74, a 3% increase in the daily timeframe.

For traders engaged in derivatives, understanding market mechanics is crucial. Today, we delve into a critical indicator: the crypto perpetual futures liquidation data from the past 24 hours. This breakdown offers a fascinating glimpse into recent market volatility and prevailing market sentiment . What Exactly is Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation? In the world of derivatives, a perpetual future is a type of futures contract that has no expiration date. This allows traders to hold leveraged positions indefinitely. However, leverage comes with inherent risk. When a trader‚Äôs position falls below a certain margin requirement, it triggers a ‚Äúliquidation.‚Äù Essentially, their position is automatically closed by the exchange to prevent further losses. This is a crucial aspect of the perpetual futures market . Our focus here is on short liquidations . A short position profits when the asset price goes down. Conversely, if the price unexpectedly rises sharply, these short positions face liquidation. High short liquidations often indicate a ‚Äúshort squeeze,‚Äù where a sudden price increase forces many short sellers to close their positions, further fueling the price rally. Decoding the Latest 24-Hour Crypto Liquidations The past 24 hours have seen significant activity in the perpetual futures market , particularly concerning liquidations. Here‚Äôs a detailed look at the breakdown: ETH: $60.27 million in liquidations, with a dominant 62.65% being short positions. This suggests a notable upward price movement for Ethereum, catching many short sellers off guard. BTC: $22.29 million in liquidations, with an even higher 75.45% being short positions. Bitcoin experienced a strong surge that led to substantial losses for those betting on a price decline. MYX: $13.13 million in liquidations, with 66.58% being short positions. This altcoin also saw a significant number of short positions wiped out, reflecting similar market dynamics. These figures highlight a clear trend: a strong upward movement in these assets, leading to the forced closure of numerous short positions. The overwhelming percentage of short liquidations across all three assets points to a market that moved decisively against bearish bets, impacting overall market sentiment . Why Do Short Liquidations Dominate the Perpetual Futures Market? The dominance of short liquidations in this 24-hour period reveals a specific kind of market action. When a large number of traders are betting on prices to fall, a sudden positive catalyst or significant buying pressure can trigger a chain reaction. As prices rise, short positions quickly become unprofitable. Exchanges then step in, liquidating these positions to protect themselves and maintain market stability. This forced buying to close short positions further accelerates the price increase, creating a ‚Äúshort squeeze.‚Äù It‚Äôs a powerful phenomenon that can lead to rapid upward price spikes, as observed in the recent crypto liquidations data. Understanding this dynamic is key to interpreting current market sentiment . Actionable Insights from Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation Data For traders, monitoring crypto perpetual futures liquidation data is more than just observing numbers; it‚Äôs about gaining strategic insights. High short liquidations can signal a strong underlying buying pressure or a market turning point where bearish sentiment is being overwhelmed. Conversely, high long liquidations would suggest a market correction or a significant downturn. What can you do with this information? Firstly, it emphasizes the importance of robust risk management, especially when using leverage. Secondly, it provides a real-time pulse on current market sentiment . If short liquidations are consistently high, it might indicate a resilient market ready to push higher, or at least one that is punishing overly bearish bets. Always combine this data with other technical and fundamental analysis for a comprehensive trading strategy. In conclusion, the past 24 hours provided a stark reminder of the volatility and potential for sharp movements within the crypto market. The substantial short liquidations across ETH, BTC, and MYX underscore a period where bullish momentum surprised many bearish traders. Monitoring these trends offers valuable insights into the market‚Äôs underlying strength and the risks associated with leveraged trading. Stay informed, stay strategic. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is crypto perpetual futures liquidation? A1: Crypto perpetual futures liquidation occurs when a trader‚Äôs leveraged position in a perpetual futures contract falls below a certain margin requirement. The exchange automatically closes the position to prevent further losses, protecting both the trader and the market. Q2: Why were short liquidations so high in the last 24 hours? A2: High short liquidations indicate that many traders betting on price declines (short positions) were caught off guard by a sudden upward price movement. This often leads to a ‚Äúshort squeeze,‚Äù where forced buying to cover positions further fuels the price increase. Q3: How does liquidation impact the crypto market? A3: Liquidations can amplify price movements. A wave of crypto liquidations can accelerate a rally (if shorts are liquidated) or a crash (if longs are liquidated), leading to increased volatility and rapid shifts in market sentiment . Q4: What does this data mean for an average trader? A4: For an average trader, this data underscores the inherent risks of leveraged trading and highlights the importance of risk management. It also provides insight into the prevailing market momentum; high short liquidations suggest bullish strength and a market punishing bearish bets. Q5: Is it possible to avoid liquidation? A5: While not always entirely avoidable in extreme market conditions, traders can significantly reduce the risk of liquidation by using lower leverage, setting stop-loss orders, and maintaining sufficient margin in their accounts. Proper risk management is key in the perpetual futures market . Did you find this breakdown helpful?

The cryptocurrency's 30-day implied volatility, as represented by Volmex's BVIV index, fell to an annualized 36.5% late on Wednesday, reaching levels last seen in October 2023, when BTC was trading below $30,000, according to data source TradingView. The new multi-year low in implied volatility suggests that options traders are not yet rushing for hedges, despite U.S. economic data raising concerns about stagflation. The demand for options, which are contracts used to hedge against or profit from price swings, is a major driver of an asset's implied volatility. The same thing can be said about stocks, where the VIX index has reversed Friday's spike from 17 to 21. The VIX measures the 30-day implied volatility in the S&P 500. BTC mirrors stock market volatility patterns BTC's implied volatility has been in a months-long downtrend, moving in the opposite direction of the cryptocurrency's price, which has surged from $70,000 to over $110,000 since November. The negative correlation marks a profound shift in bitcoin's market dynamics. Historically, BTC's volatility and its spot price moved in tandem, with volatility rising in both bull and bear markets. The change in this spot-volatility correlation is attributed, in part, to the growing popularity of structured products that involve the writing (selling) of out-of-the-money call options, analysts told CoinDesk . This new dynamic suggests that bitcoin is increasingly mirroring patterns on Wall Street, where implied volatility often dwindles during steady bull runs.

With the SEC recently greenlighting the ProShares Ultra XRP ETF (UXRP), attention has shifted to spot ETF approval odds, now pegged at 85% for September or October 2025. This development is sparking fresh DOGE capital rotation and highlighting new altcoin breakout stories. MAGACOIN FINANCE, a rising name in the current altcoin rotation after XRP ETF news, is capturing interest from investors seeking high potential altcoin plays and outsized returns. XRP ETF Buzz Drives Market Shifts The SEC‚Äôs approval of the ProShares Ultra XRP ETF, a 2x leveraged futures-based fund, signals new momentum for XRP. With formal listing standards now in place, traders are positioning ahead of a possible spot ETF debut. XRP and DOGE investor shift patterns show heavy rotation into altcoins gaining ETF spillover as institutional and retail players bet on further regulatory progress. Industry analysts are closely watching the odds of a spot XRP ETF in late 2025. Many believe this move could unlock new inflows and intensify crypto market rotation, especially among high-potential altcoins tied to emerging crypto opportunities. As a result, XRP investors are increasingly reallocating to new narratives, searching for the next big opportunity to capture gains from the shifting ETF landscape. DOGE Investor Trends, Capital Rotation Sparks New Breakout Dogecoin is another major beneficiary of the current environment. DOGE investor trends show sharp upticks in both accumulation and trading volume, as meme coin sentiment rallies on the back of ETF speculation. Social channels are tracking a visible DOGE capital rotation, with traders seeking high potential altcoin breakouts connected to market-wide volatility. Altcoin rotation after ETF headlines has not only lifted DOGE but also boosted several new projects. Emerging crypto opportunities now share the spotlight, with analysts highlighting meme coins and high potential altcoin entries as must-watch for this cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE Accumulation Builds as XRP ETF Speculation Boosts Altcoin Sentiment MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly rising as accumulation surges among altcoin traders. This new contender stands out in the altcoin rotation after XRP ETF news, drawing in both meme coin enthusiasts and risk-on capital. Analysts project MAGACOIN FINANCE could target 15,400% gains, thanks to a blend of strong community activity, high engagement across social platforms, and sharp increases in wallet growth. Much of this momentum is linked to the spillover from DOGE and XRP ETF speculation, as traders search for a high potential altcoin that hasn‚Äôt yet run. Accumulation data reveals steady inflows as crypto market rotation picks up speed, putting MAGACOIN FINANCE firmly on lists of new altcoin breakout candidates. For investors tracking emerging crypto opportunities, MAGACOIN FINANCE is viewed as a fresh, high-upside target with the right blend of narrative and volatility to fuel the next major move. Wrapping Up XRP ETF speculation is fueling broad capital rotation, shifting attention toward both DOGE and new altcoin breakouts. DOGE investor trends and XRP and DOGE investor shift patterns show that high potential altcoin picks are now in the spotlight. MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out among the current wave, building rapid momentum and targeting 15,400% gains as accumulation grows. For those looking for the next big move during this cycle of altcoin rotation after XRP ETF news, MAGACOIN FINANCE is an emerging story to watch.

But not all of them have value. What matters more are the projects with real use and strong potential for gains. For people new to crypto, knowing which ones to trust can be difficult. This list highlights four top performing crypto projects in July that showed clear signs of momentum: Cold Wallet, Solana, SUI, and Hedera. Each has a different purpose, but all of them are gaining interest as the market looks ahead. 1. Cold Wallet: Gaining Speed with Strong Funding and Features Cold Wallet is taking a different path from most wallets, which is helping it become a top performing crypto. While most wallets only store assets, Cold Wallet pays users for staying active. It offers cashback in CWT for every swap, bridge, or ramp. There is also a referral system and reward tiers that increase these earnings. The early response to the presale shows interest is growing. Cold Wallet has already raised over $5.7 million in a few weeks. Whale wallets are starting to get involved. Right now, Stage 16 prices CWT at $0.00942, and the listing is confirmed at $0.3517. This gives early users a possible return of 4,900%. What also drives this growth is the $270 million purchase of Plus Wallet, which added a large user base right away. This move shows Cold Wallet is planning for long-term scale. With working features, strong backing, and a major merger already done, Cold Wallet is setting itself apart as a smart option in this cycle. 2. Solana‚Äôs Continued Growth Shows Long-Term Promise Solana continues to be one of the top performing crypto assets, with its price now at $169.45. After recovering from earlier issues, the network has become one of the busiest in the space. Thanks to its fast speeds and low fees, it supports a wide range of use cases from NFTs to DeFi. User activity stays strong every day, and developers are still building actively on the network. It is even challenging Ethereum in daily usage, but without the higher costs. Projects like Stepn, Helium, and Jupiter Exchange are growing on Solana, adding to its ecosystem. With consistent growth and strong use in the real world, Solana‚Äôs pace is hard to overlook. 3. SUI Gains Attention with Developer-Friendly Features SUI is trading at $0.77 and is showing steady momentum as a newer Layer 1 network that focuses on user experience and speed. Supported by Mysten Labs and built using the Move language, SUI gives developers more flexibility when creating dApps. This flexibility helps SUI stand out in areas such as gaming, lending, and DeFi applications. Its total value locked continues to rise, and new launches are bringing in activity. Even though it is newer compared to platforms like Solana or Ethereum, its early position could be its biggest strength. Current trends suggest SUI is one of the top performing crypto assets to keep an eye on. 4. Hedera Builds Enterprise Use Through Real Adoption Hedera (HBAR), priced at $0.078, also makes the list of top performing crypto assets this week. Its edge comes from actual usage in real-world business settings. Built on Hashgraph, not traditional blockchain, Hedera delivers speed, fixed transaction costs, and low energy usage. This makes it ideal for large companies building at scale. Industries such as healthcare, identity systems, and supply chains are already using Hedera. Well-known companies like IBM, Google, and Dell are part of its Governing Council, showing strong support. Rather than being just another altcoin, Hedera is turning into important infrastructure for future use. Comparing These Projects for 2025 Potential Solana stays ahead with its fast network, low fees, and consistent builder activity. SUI is rising fast with its focus on developer tools, new product growth, and strong potential. At the same time, Hedera is becoming a key player in enterprise use with support from major companies and working systems in place. Still, for those looking at potential gains, Cold Wallet is making waves. Stage 16 has CWT priced at $0.00942, and its planned listing price is $0.3517, showing a 4,900% return for early buyers. This is not just guesswork. The $270 million buyout of Plus Wallet instantly brought in a large and active user base. For those exploring the next top performing crypto , Cold Wallet stands out with real progress, strong early backing, and a system built to scale. Getting in early could make a major difference in outcomes.

49672234,549842,1754539209,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49672234.jpeg,"Ethereum, Not Bitcoin, May Be The Future‚Äôs Preferred Store Of Value ‚Äì VanEck Report",https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-bitcoin-store-value-vaneck-report/,"In its July 2025 crypto monthly recap report, global investment management firm VanEck suggested that Ethereum (ETH) could emerge as a superior store of value compared to Bitcoin (BTC). The report pointed to ETH‚Äôs lower inflation rate in recent months relative to BTC, alongside its growing utility within decentralized finance (DeFi). Ethereum A Better Store Of Value Than Bitcoin? In recent years, a growing number of companies have diversified their treasuries by allocating capital to digital assets ‚Äì most notably Bitcoin. However, emerging trends show that corporations are also beginning to accumulate Ethereum, recognizing its potential as both a yield-generating and deflationary asset. VanEck‚Äôs report emphasizes that while Bitcoin‚Äôs finite supply and predictable issuance policies make it a strong candidate for a store of value, Ethereum provides greater financial flexibility. In particular, ETH holders can stake their assets to earn rewards, collect network revenue, and participate in DeFi protocols to generate additional yield. The report also highlights key differences in the monetary policies of both networks. Ethereum‚Äôs initial issuance rate at launch was 14.4%, compared to Bitcoin‚Äôs 9.3%. However, two major policy changes have since dramatically reduced ETH‚Äôs inflation rate ‚Äì bringing it below Bitcoin‚Äôs. The first was Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP-1559), implemented in August 2021, which introduced a mechanism to ‚Äúburn‚Äù a portion of transaction fees. This effectively created deflationary pressure during periods of high network activity, reducing the total supply of ETH. The second transformative event was ‚ÄúThe Merge‚Äù in September 2022, when Ethereum transitioned from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. This change drastically reduced issuance ‚Äì from approximately 13,000 ETH/day to around 1,700 ETH/day ‚Äì by eliminating the need to pay miners. Following these changes, ETH‚Äôs inflation rate fell below Bitcoin‚Äôs for the first time in March 2023. Since then, ETH‚Äôs supply has grown by only 0.2%, compared to Bitcoin‚Äôs 3%. The report states: Total supply of ETH fell between October 7th, 2022, and April 4th, 2024, moving from ~120.6M on to a low of ~120.1M on, achieving an annualized (-0.25%) inflation rate over the period. Since that time, ETH burn has been reduced due to the increase in Ethereum transaction throughput, and the network has accrued (+0.5%) in additional supply. Regardless, over that same period, BTC supply has increased (+1.1%). Companies Flocking To ETH Accumulation Over the past month, several companies have unveiled Ethereum-focused treasury strategies. For instance, cryptocurrency firm Bit Digital recently crossed 120,000 ETH in total holdings. Meanwhile, Bitcoin mining firm BitMine Immersion Technologies revealed that its ETH holdings had surged past 833,000 tokens, making it the largest known corporate holder of the digital asset. At press time, ETH trades at $3,643, up 2.3% in the past 24 hours.",Ethereum|Altcoin|bitcoin|btc|Cryptocurrency|EIP-1559|ETH|Ether|Ethereum inflation|ethereum issuance rate|ETHUSDT|Store of value,EN,0,0,ETH|BTC|MACROECONOMICS|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-07 04:00:09
49672274,https://thecoinrise.com/top-crypto-to-buy-now-blockdag-extends-lead-over-ethereum-solana-toncoin/,1754539226,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecoinrise.png,"Top Crypto to Buy Now: BlockDAG Extends Lead Over Ethereum, Solana & Toncoin",https://thecoinrise.com/top-crypto-to-buy-now-blockdag-extends-lead-over-ethereum-solana-toncoin/,"The market is full of opportunities, but picking the right ones is what makes all the difference. This month, a mix of presale gems and established names is catching the attention of traders and long-term holders alike. BlockDAG is offering one of the lowest entry points we‚Äôve seen in a presale with high ROI potential, while Ethereum keeps drawing institutional money, Solana has become a key player in staking and futures markets, and Toncoin is building on deep ecosystem partnerships. If you‚Äôre looking for the best crypto to buy, this list gives you a clear breakdown of what‚Äôs trending now, why these coins are worth watching, and how they‚Äôre positioned for the months ahead. 1. BlockDAG: A Presale with Real Tools and Big Incentives BlockDAG is offering one of the most exciting presale setups we‚Äôve seen in 2025. With approximately $363 million already raised and around 24.6 billion tokens sold, it‚Äôs clear that demand is strong. The temporary $0.0016 tier running until August 11 is a big draw, especially when compared to the current batch price of $0.0276 and the planned $0.05 listing price. This gives early buyers a chance at an impressive 3,000% potential ROI. On top of this, BlockDAG has launched a 10 BTC auction prize pool worth about $1.1 million, where rewards are distributed proportionally to the amount purchased. This combination of low entry pricing and direct incentives is designed to push engagement in the final days of the presale. The project also goes beyond traditional token sales. Its Dashboard V4 simulates a live trading environment with real-time BDAG/USD charts, functional order books, wallet updates, and instant buy/sell features. This gamified setup allows participants to test strategies and get comfortable with the interface before launch. Combined with a growing community of over 2 million users mining through its X1 Mobile Miner, BlockDAG is setting up a full-fledged ecosystem even before listing. If you‚Äôre deciding on the best crypto to buy, BlockDAG‚Äôs mix of value pricing, training tools, and community incentives make it a standout choice. 2. Ethereum: Strong Institutional Backing Ethereum remains one of the best crypto to buy as its position in the market continues to strengthen. Currently trading between $3,600 and $3,700, ETH has been on an upswing, gaining around 54% over the past month and outperforming Bitcoin‚Äôs 10% rise. Even with a significant $465 million ETF outflow from BlackRock‚Äôs ETHA on August 4, corporate treasuries now hold close to 966,000 ETH, worth about $3.5 billion, up from just 116,000 ETH at the end of 2024. This shows confidence from institutions, many of which are also attracted to Ethereum‚Äôs staking yields of around 3‚Äì4%. Regulatory developments are another tailwind. With the GENIUS Act and stablecoin legislation in motion, Ethereum is becoming a preferred choice for corporates and institutions looking for a reliable asset. Analysts believe it has the potential to test resistance levels around $4,100 and possibly move toward its all-time high of $4,865. With a robust network, consistent upgrades, and deep institutional adoption, Ethereum is cementing its place as a cornerstone crypto investment for 2025. 3. Solana: Institutional Demand and Key Price Levels Solana is proving why it deserves attention, especially if you‚Äôre considering the best crypto to buy in 2025. Trading between $165 and $170, SOL has seen a sharp rise in institutional activity. CME futures open interest for Solana has climbed to $800 million, a massive 370% increase month-over-month, and the first U.S. Solana staking ETF has already launched. Adding to this momentum, Bit Mining recently invested $5 million in SOL and unveiled plans to raise $300 million for Solana treasury and infrastructure projects. On-chain data shows whales are accumulating, with $52 million in recent withdrawals from exchanges, and nearly 43% of holders are sitting at unrealized losses, signaling possible strong hands taking advantage of current price levels. Technically, Solana is at a key support range between $165 and $170. A sustained breakout above $171 could set it up for a rally toward $200 or even higher long-term targets of $900 if bullish momentum builds. These factors make Solana a coin to watch closely in the coming weeks. 4. Toncoin: Building Big Partnerships Toncoin is holding steady around $3.6‚Äì3.7 and has grown 24% over the past month. It‚Äôs quickly becoming a project to watch, especially after the TON Foundation secured a $400 million institutional treasury partnership. DeFi platform STON.fi also raised $9.5 million to enhance cross-chain functionality, boosting Toncoin‚Äôs utility. One of the most talked-about developments is Nasdaq-listed Verb Technology raising $558 million to launch the first public Toncoin treasury, with the deal closing by August 7. This growth is closely tied to Toncoin‚Äôs deep integration with Telegram, which rolled out TON Wallet access to its 87 million U.S. users. While some analysts predict a possible pullback to $2.62 in the short term, others see this as a chance for strategic entry before the ecosystem expands further. Combined with its growing visibility and institutional adoption, Toncoin offers both short-term volatility and long-term upside, making it one of the more interesting picks in today‚Äôs market. Summing Up If you‚Äôre evaluating the best crypto to buy , these four are hard to ignore. BlockDAG stands out with its $0.0016 presale tier, interactive trading dashboard, and 10 BTC auction, creating strong FOMO for those who don‚Äôt want to miss out before August 11. Ethereum continues to attract big money and regulatory support, strengthening its market position. Solana is showing powerful institutional demand and promising price action at critical levels. Toncoin‚Äôs ecosystem growth and deep Telegram integration make it a compelling choice for those willing to ride out its volatility. Together, these projects show the variety of opportunities the current market offers, whether you want a high-ROI presale, a trusted long-term asset, or a project with bold ecosystem plans.

This remarkable technical performance provides the foundation for the collaboration with Perplexity, demonstrating Artprice‚Äôs ability to integrate and make the most of the most advanced AI technologies. Artprice‚Äôs databases, with over 880,000 listed artists and more than 30 million auction results spanning three centuries of art history since 1700, represent the world‚Äôs most comprehensive informational heritage in the artistic field. This patrimonial wealth, enriched by 181 million images and managed through partnerships with 7,200 auction houses worldwide, creates a unique data ecosystem that, combined with Perplexity‚Äôs real-time search capabilities, generates unprecedented synergies. Technological Assessment and Selection of Perplexity as a Strategic Partner Comprehensive Evaluation Process and Informed Technology Choice In its research and development activities, Artprice maintains an active technological watch by subscribing to practically all the main AI platforms available on the market, ensuring a continuous strategic overview of AI developments. This thorough evaluation approach, led under the direction of Thierry Ehrmann, founder and AI specialist since 1987, with his IT teams, enables Artprice to maintain deep expertise in assessing the performance, accuracy, and reliability of AI platforms. Based on this comprehensive evaluation of over 20 leading AI platforms, Artprice determined that Perplexity‚Äôs approach‚Äîparticularly through its Premium Perplexity Labs service‚Äîrepresents the most advanced AI technology currently available. The differentiating criteria identified include Perplexity‚Äôs error rate, close to zero and unmatched to date, and its systematic methodology of citing official sources with URLs, offering the transparency and verifiability that Artprice requires for professional art market analysis. Advanced Technological Architecture of Perplexity Perplexity Labs is the most sophisticated AI service currently available, leveraging cutting-edge language models including GPT-4o and Claude 4.0 Sonnet, enabling deep analysis and generation of high-quality content. The platform conducts autonomous sessions of about 10 minutes or more, combining deep web browsing, code execution, graph creation, and multi-tool integration to transform ideas into complete deliverables.

Integrating this patrimonial documentation with Perplexity Labs‚Äô capabilities will create unprecedented synergies for historical and predictive analysis of the art market. This combination will reveal hidden patterns in the evolution of artistic tastes, valuations, and cultural trends over more than three centuries. This democratization is part of a broader trend in the evolution of the art market toward greater accessibility, illustrated by the 17% growth in sales by dealers with turnover below $250,000, and the increase in auction sales for works under $5,000. The Artprice-Perplexity alliance contributes to this trend by making technological excellence accessible to a broader audience of professionals and knowledgeable amateurs. Philosophical Dimension: A New Paradigm for AI in Art and Culture Redefining Intelligence in the Artistic Context The alliance between Artprice and Perplexity transcends purely economic and technological considerations and is part of a profound philosophical reflection on the nature of intelligence and its manifestation in the artistic and cultural domain. This philosophical dimension, emphasized by Thierry Ehrmann in his statement ‚ÄúThere can be no artificial intelligence without human intelligence,‚Äù sets a new paradigm of complementarity between human and artificial cognitive capacities. This philosophical approach opposes reductionist views of AI that see machines as substitutes for human intelligence, offering instead a symbiotic vision in which AI amplifies and enriches human capacities without replacing them. In the artistic context, this philosophy is especially significant because it recognizes that aesthetic understanding, cultural appreciation, and critical judgment remain fundamentally human, even when assisted by advanced technological tools. Epistemological Implications for Art Sciences Integrating AI into artistic research practices and art market analysis raises fundamental epistemological questions about the production and validation of knowledge in this field. The approach developed by Artprice and Perplexity‚Äîbased on systematic citation of official sources and information verifiability‚Äîestablishes new standards of scientific rigor for AI use in cultural research. This methodological shift deeply influences academic and professional practices, enabling researchers to access documentary bodies of unprecedented scale while adhering to traditional scientific rigor. The AI‚Äôs ability to process thousands of sources simultaneously and identify complex patterns opens new research possibilities unthinkable using traditional methods. Forward-looking Vision: Toward a Techno-ecology of the Sensitive The Artprice-Perplexity alliance fits within a forward-looking vision that goes beyond the simple instrumental use of technology to propose a true ‚Äútechno-ecology of the sensitive,‚Äù where digital tools become organic extensions of human sensibility and intelligence. This approach recognizes that aesthetic experience and cultural understanding cannot be reduced to computational processes, but can be enriched and deepened by appropriate intelligent systems. This philosophy of AI in art stands out from purely functionalist approaches by recognizing the existential and subjective dimension of artistic experience. It proposes a model of human-machine interaction where technology serves to reveal and explore the hidden dimensions of aesthetic experience rather than to replace or simplify it. Impact on the Educational and Professional Art Ecosystem Transformation of Pedagogical Practices in Artistic Education Artprice‚Äôs initiative to integrate AI training into its services is part of a broader transformation of pedagogical practices in artistic and cultural education. This shift, seen in many educational institutions, reflects the need to adapt training to the sector‚Äôs new technological realities. Training programs developed around the Artprice-Perplexity alliance contribute to the emergence of new professional profiles, such as ‚ÄúAI Artists,‚Äù ‚ÄúPrompt Designers,‚Äù or ‚ÄúGenerative AI Specialists,‚Äù responding to a growing demand in the job market for the creative industries. This professionalization of AI use in art creates new career opportunities while preserving the importance of traditional artistic training. Influence on Cultural and Museum Institutions The impact of the Artprice-Perplexity alliance extends beyond the commercial framework to influence practices in global cultural and museum institutions. Museums‚Äîan important part of Artprice‚Äôs clientele‚Äîbenefit from these technological innovations to improve their conservation, research, and cultural mediation practices. This influence is particularly evident in the development of new approaches to cultural mediation, where AI allows for the creation of personalized and interactive experiences for visitors. Institutions can use these technologies to develop adaptive visitor journeys, personalized recommendation systems, and in-depth analysis tools for their collections. Creation of an International Network of Technological Excellence The Artprice-Perplexity alliance contributes to the creation of an international network of technological excellence in the artistic and cultural sphere, connecting institutions, professionals, and researchers worldwide in innovative AI application practices. This network, bolstered by Artprice‚Äôs multilingual distribution in 119 countries and 11 languages, encourages the exchange of best practices and the collaborative development of new applications. This international dimension takes on particular importance in the current geopolitical context, as France seeks to position itself as the world‚Äôs third power in artificial intelligence after the US and China. The Artprice-Perplexity alliance, recognized and supported by French authorities, contributes to this ambition by showcasing French excellence in applying AI to the cultural and creative sectors. Future Perspectives and Strategic Developments Technological Roadmap 2025-2030 The collaboration between Artprice and Perplexity fits into a long-term strategic vision articulated around Artprice‚Äôs 2025-2030 plan, positioning the company as the global leader in AI-driven art market information. This roadmap foresees the progressive development of deeper integrations between Artprice‚Äôs proprietary technologies, including its Intuitive Artmarket¬Æ AI and its Blind Spot AI¬Æ technology, with Perplexity‚Äôs advanced capabilities. Future developments will likely focus on creating seamless integration between Artprice‚Äôs historical data and Perplexity‚Äôs real-time search capabilities, particularly via API connections or shared analysis platforms. The partnership could also explore joint development of AI tools specifically designed for art market analysis and prediction. Expansion into New Markets and Applications The success of this collaboration opens up prospects for expansion into other specialized knowledge domains, generally extending the influence of both companies beyond the traditional art market. The official recognition of La Demeure du Chaos/Abode of Chaos (dixit NYT) by Thierry Ehrmann‚Äîat the heart of Artprice‚Äôs headquarters‚Äîas a total work of art by the French Minister of Culture, Madame Rachida DATI, and its role in the national AI development strategy indicates potential government support for extending this collaboration model. Such cultural expansion could include developing similar applications in other sectors, such as architectural heritage, music, literature, or film, creating an integrated artificial cultural intelligence ecosystem. The methodological approach developed as part of the Artprice-Perplexity alliance could thus serve as a model for other sectors requiring the analysis of large amounts of cultural and historical data. Contribution to Global AI Innovation The Artprice-Perplexity alliance positions both companies to continue leading innovation in AI applications for the cultural and creative industries. Joint research and development efforts are producing new AI methodologies applicable beyond art market analysis, broadly contributing to the wider development of AI in cultural preservation and market intelligence.

The combined firm will be named Pubco and will trade under the ticker ‚ÄúPRTX,‚Äù an official release noted. SPAC Earmarks $31M for BTC Purchase The special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) deal will deliver up to $240 million to Parataxis Holdings, subject to shareholder redemptions. ‚ÄúThis includes $31 million of equity that will be funded immediately to purchase BTC,‚Äù the company said. Further, the deal values the combined company at $400 million, at a $10 share price. The share purchase agreement will give Pubco the flexibility to raise additional capital as needed to support the continued accumulation of BTC, it added. According to Parataxis CEO Edward Chin, the deal would make the new entity ‚Äúwell capitalised‚Äù to execute a BTC treasury strategy in the US. ‚ÄúWe will also be ideally positioned to further establish and grow our successful foothold in South Korea with Parataxis Korea,‚Äù Chin said.

However, at the beginning of the week, the leading Layer-1 protocol bounced back to reclaim $3,560. But whilst whales are buying ETH in droves, the smart money is looking elsewhere for serious gains‚Äîand the next ETH meme token earmarked by analysts for 150x gains has arrived in the form of Layer Brett ($LBRETT). Pundits believe that the Ethereum Layer 2 scalability solution memecoin is fully primed to outpace even Ethereum itself with staking rewards above 20,000% APY and explosive price potential. Learn why this low-cap blue chip gem in its crypto presale stage is seen in crypto circles as the next big thing. The Problem With Ethereum (And How $LBRETT Solves Them) Despite the recent uptick in Ethereum prices due to whale activity and on-chain ETF holdings surging to 40% in the past month‚Äînot to mention institutional giants like BlackRock also ramping up‚Äîits fundamental issues remain unsolved. Ethereum paved the way for smart contracts, but it hasn‚Äôt aged gracefully. High gas fees and slow confirmation times persist, requiring a legitimate Ethereum Layer 2 geared specifically to tackle these pain points head-on. Here‚Äôs why Layer Brett solves them: Ultra-low gas fees and lightning-fast transactions Anchored to Ethereum security but built for scale Seamless staking and buying via MetaMask or Trust Wallet Community-first model with no KYC requirements Layer Brett makes your Ethereum transactions run smoothly, bull or bear market notwithstanding, by processing transactions offchain and syncing securely back to the Ethereum mainnet. How $LBRETT Parlays Meme Power Into Real Utility Most meme tokens are just hype with no real features. That‚Äôs not the case here with Layer Brett . Beneath the viral-inducing packaging, Layer Brett offers massive utility. It‚Äôs a fully scalable, functional blockchain project with actual user benefits. Through its native dApp, users can stake $LBRETT in seconds, earning massive yields powered by low operating costs. Ethereum staking, by contrast, involves lockups, centralization risk, and far lower returns. Layer Brett offers strictly better rewards‚Äîadding fun to function altogether. Ethereum Dominated Early‚ÄîNow Layer Brett Offers a New Path Ethereum will always be a foundational piece of crypto infrastructure. But traders are increasingly diversifying into projects like Layer Brett that offer meme coin upside with actual blockchain substance. While Ethereum is valued in the hundreds of billions, $LBRETT is still under the radar. That means there‚Äôs more room for exponential growth. And with current Ethereum gas fees still reaching $10‚Äì$20 during congestion, it‚Äôs no surprise users are migrating to Ethereum Layer 2 solutions like Layer Brett. Why the Crypto Community Is Rallying Behind Layer Brett Unlike basic meme plays, Layer Brett fuses viral appeal with real infrastructure. It‚Äôs meme-born, utility-built. This project is already generating massive attention as one of the top diamonds in the rough in presale right now. With just 10 billion tokens, a transparent tokenomics model, and a $1 million giveaway, early buyers are perfectly positioned for huge upside. Add in NFT integration, gamified staking, and future cross-chain interoperability, and it‚Äôs clear Layer Brett is built to scale. Ethereum Walked So Layer Brett Can Run Ethereum led the revolution‚Äîbut now, Layer Brett is pushing it further. With the speed of Layer 2, the power of community, and the potential for 150x gains, this is the best crypto to invest in before the next crypto bull run in 2025 kicks off. Buy, stake, and meme your way into the future. Don‚Äôt let this Layer 2 rocket take off without you. Layer Brett is available in presale‚Äîbut don‚Äôt wait too late. This is YOUR opportunity to get in early on the most scalable meme project to ever launch on Ethereum.",Press Release,EN,0,0,ETH|ZRX|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-07 04:21:05

Curve‚Äôs deployment on Etherelink gives the Tezos ecosystem access to deep stablecoin liquidity and efficient pegged asset trading. The firm is also participating in Apple Farm Season 2 rewards program to encourage active use of DeFi apps on Etherlink. Curve has deployed on the Tezos Layer 2 blockchain, Etherlink. The decentralized exchange platforms will offer deep liquidity and low slippage in trading stablecoins, pegged assets, and cross-currency pairs. Etherlink is designed as a Tezos-native Smart Rollup, unlike most EVM L2s, which rely on separate governance and upgrade mechanisms. The firm said the L2 blockchain benefits from Tezos‚Äô on-chain governance, low fees, and fast decision-making. Curve seeks to bridge Tezos and EVM ecosystems @CurveFinance ‚Äì the go-to DEX for efficient, low-slippage trading of stablecoins, pegged assets, and cross-currency pairs. ‚Äî Etherlink üîó (@etherlink) August 6, 2025 Curve believes the deep protocol integration will position it as the major liquidity engine bridging the Tezos and EVM ecosystems. Maximilian Roszko, who leads network expansion at Curve, said a Curve deployment on Etherelink gives the Tezos ecosystem access to deep stablecoin liquidity and efficient pegged asset trading. He acknowledged that it was what made the initiative strategically interesting for the company. Curve said it will be among the platforms participating in Apple Farm Season 2 as part of its mission to support its growth. The initiative is a rewards program designed to boost the use of DeFi apps on Etherlink. Apple Farm launched on Etherlink and has over $3 million in rewards to drive further adoption across the Layer 2 DeFi ecosystem. Curve said the launch makes it the stablecoin and pegged asset backbone for both Etherlink and Tezos. It aims to bring liquidity to the integrated rollup and L1 pairing. The firm sees the initiative as a step towards better stablecoin infrastructure across the L2 network. ‚ÄúHaving Curve as our stablecoin backbone changes everything for Etherlink users. Traders can now access the deep liquidity they‚Äôre used to on mainnet, but with the speed and cost benefits of our Tezos-native rollup architecture.‚Äù -David Relkin, Head of DeFi and Nomadic Labs. Curve‚Äôs founder, Michael Egorov, believes the firm is poised for growth this year. He believes it will be driven by new exchanges for stablecoins pegged to different fiat currencies. He also believes that blockchain developers will cause the number of DEX and CEX stablecoin offerings to increase through the creation of new alternatives. Etherlink sees increased ecosystem deployment Etherlink has also seen strong ecosystem momentum, receiving several developments across its ecosystem in recent months. Midas launched two new tokens, mBASIS and mTBILL, on the Layer 2 blockchain last month. The company said the partnership resulted in increased activity on Etherlink with enhanced staking and liquidity channels for DeFi protocols. The Etherlink team championed the initiative with a $3 million incentive for developers. The Etherlink team said the firm‚Äôs recent launch of platforms like uranium.io and Superland partnership helps it create a robust foundation for sustained ecosystem growth. They added that the continued ecosystem announcements will stimulate growth within Tezos L2 and potentially alter DeFi tokenization landscapes with efficient, compliant solutions. The blockchain‚Äôs network performance also surged as season 1 attracted thousands of users. Its performance peaked at $47.7M in TVL and $88.5M in on-chain asset value. Its smart contract storage speed is also improving up to 30x, and bridging times are reduced from 15 days to under a minute.",Industry Thoughts,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|TOKEN SALE|ZRX|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-07 04:24:51

A fascinating trend has emerged, indicating a significant shift in market dynamics. Are we witnessing a period of crucial stability for the leading digital asset? This analysis delves into the latest Bitcoin holder behavior , offering essential perspectives on the current market. Understanding Bitcoin Short-Term Holders: A Key Market Indicator Recent data suggests a notable change in the behavior of Bitcoin short-term holders . These are individuals who have held their BTC for less than 155 days. Historically, this group is more prone to selling, especially when prices fluctuate. However, the current scenario paints a different picture, according to Cointelegraph, citing Glassnode. These holders have significantly reduced their profit-taking activities. The proportion of spent volume from holders in profit has dropped to just 45%. This is a crucial metric, as it shows less immediate desire to sell for gains. Furthermore, approximately 70% of their total holdings remain profitable. This indicates a strong underlying value perception among these newer market participants. This easing of selling pressure from Bitcoin short-term holders is a positive sign. It suggests a growing confidence in Bitcoin‚Äôs current valuation, even amidst broader market uncertainties. It reflects a maturing market where immediate profit-taking isn‚Äôt the sole driver for these specific participants, indicating a shift in overall Bitcoin holder behavior . Navigating Bitcoin Price Consolidation: What Does It Mean? Bitcoin‚Äôs price has been consolidating around the $114,800 mark. This period of Bitcoin price consolidation is often characterized by a lack of strong directional movement. Instead, the price tends to trade within a relatively narrow range. For investors, consolidation periods can be both challenging and opportune: Challenges: Lack of clear trends can make short-term trading difficult. Opportunities: It can represent a period of accumulation for long-term investors. It also allows the market to digest previous price movements before a potential breakout. The fact that Bitcoin short-term holders are easing their selling during this phase provides valuable insight. It implies that many are content to hold, rather than liquidate, even without significant upward momentum. This behavior contributes directly to the stability observed in the current BTC market balance , showcasing a more resilient Bitcoin holder behavior . Achieving BTC Market Balance: Insights from Holder Behavior The concept of BTC market balance refers to a state where buying and selling pressures are relatively equal. When the market is balanced, it tends to exhibit lower volatility and more predictable movements. The data from Glassnode strongly supports this notion. When 70% of short-term holder holdings remain profitable, yet only 45% of spent volume comes from profitable coins, it signals a healthy equilibrium. Holders are not rushing to sell their profitable coins, indicating they anticipate further gains or are simply comfortable with their current positions. This cautious approach helps to prevent drastic price swings. This balanced state is vital for sustainable growth in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. It builds a foundation of confidence and reduces the likelihood of sharp corrections driven by impulsive selling from newer participants. Understanding this aspect of Bitcoin holder behavior is key to long-term market assessment. Future Outlook: What This Crypto Market Analysis Suggests This detailed crypto market analysis paints an optimistic picture for Bitcoin‚Äôs near-term trajectory. The reduced selling from Bitcoin short-term holders during a period of price consolidation suggests underlying strength. This careful Bitcoin holder behavior is key to understanding the market‚Äôs next moves. What could this mean for the future? Increased Stability: Less erratic behavior from a historically volatile group contributes to overall market calm. Potential for Upside: If short-term holders are not selling, it means more supply is being held, which can pave the way for upward price movements once demand increases. Maturing Market: This trend indicates a growing maturity within the Bitcoin market, where participants are becoming more strategic rather than reactive. While past performance does not guarantee future results, the current data provides a compelling narrative of a market finding its footing. The collective patience of Bitcoin short-term holders is a testament to Bitcoin‚Äôs enduring appeal and its potential for continued growth. This particular aspect of Bitcoin holder behavior is a strong indicator of market health. Conclusion: A Foundation of Patience for Bitcoin The recent actions of Bitcoin short-term holders are a powerful indicator of a stabilizing market. Their reduced selling pressure amid Bitcoin price consolidation is fostering a healthier BTC market balance . This crucial development, highlighted by recent crypto market analysis and positive Bitcoin holder behavior , suggests a foundational shift towards more patient and strategic holding. As the market continues to evolve, understanding the nuances of holder behavior will remain paramount for all participants. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What defines Bitcoin short-term holders? A1: Bitcoin short-term holders are typically defined as entities or individuals who have held their Bitcoin for less than 155 days. They often react more quickly to price movements compared to long-term holders. Q2: What does it mean when Bitcoin is in a period of price consolidation? A2: Bitcoin price consolidation occurs when the price trades within a relatively narrow range after a significant move. It indicates a period of indecision or equilibrium between buyers and sellers, often preceding a new trend. Q3: How does reduced selling by short-term holders impact Bitcoin‚Äôs price? A3: When Bitcoin short-term holders reduce their selling, it indicates they are less inclined to take profits or cut losses. This reduces selling pressure on the market, contributing to price stability and potentially setting the stage for future upward movement if demand increases. Q4: What is the significance of BTC market balance? A4: BTC market balance signifies a state where buying and selling forces are relatively equal, leading to lower volatility. This balance creates a more stable and predictable environment, which can build investor confidence and support sustainable growth. Q5: Does this analysis suggest a good time to buy Bitcoin? A5: While this analysis highlights a period of stability and reduced selling pressure from Bitcoin short-term holders , investment decisions should always be based on individual financial goals and thorough research. Market stability can be seen as an opportune time for some, but it does not guarantee future price increases. If you found this analysis insightful, share it with your network!

The price formed a short-term top and started a fresh decline below the $3.020 level. The price dipped below the $3.00 level. There was a move below $2.950 and the price tested the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.730 swing low to the $3.106 high. However, the bulls were active near the $2.920 zone. The price is now trading near $2.980 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $3.00 level. There is also a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3.020 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The first major resistance is near the $3.10 level. A clear move above the $3.10 resistance might send the price toward the $3.120 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $3.180 resistance or even $3.20 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near the $3.250 zone. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $3.020 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.920 level. The next major support is near the $2.880 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.730 swing low to the $3.106 high. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.880 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.810 support.

Dogecoin is once again nearing the $1 target mark as the whole crypto market rebounds. Several traders recall the last time DOGE approached this level and are keenly observing a repeat of such. But while the spotlight shines on DOGE, there‚Äôs movement in other corners of the market too‚Äîespecially around XRP, PEPE, and a surprising new entry, MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP Gains Momentum with ETF Buzz XRP has rallied over the last few days amid speculation that the ETF might be approved. The coin surged above $3.0, increasing by nearly 33 percent over a single month. According to some analysts, this may be the beginning of something bigger. XRP may also breach the $4 mark this year, especially when regulators provide clear guidelines or when an ETF is launched. The investor confidence is gaining presently, and the trading volume proves it. XRP is also benefiting from the overall market sentiment. Bitcoin‚Äôs stability and renewed interest in altcoins are helping push XRP higher. With more institutions eyeing XRP, the coin‚Äôs fundamentals and network strength are also receiving fresh attention. PEPE Comes Roaring Back PEPE has recovered in the crypto market after consolidating for some weeks The memecoin is trading at $0.00001048 today. The memecoin has benefitted from the overall market recovery and social media hype. For many, PEPE‚Äôs recovery signals that the meme coin market isn‚Äôt just alive‚Äîit‚Äôs gearing up for a new run. Investors are now hunting for the next coin with viral potential and are hoping to catch the wave early. Some Traders Bet on MAGACOIN FINANCE Instead While Dogecoin‚Äôs path to $1 continues to build excitement, a newer coin is turning heads‚ÄîMAGACOIN FINANCE. The project is generating hype due to its branding technique and meme-based approach. According to analysts, MAGACOIN has the potential to provide a massive 18,700% ROI before the current bull market reaches full swing. MAGACOIN FINANCE provides deflationary tokenomics, staking abilities, and long-term development plans. The qualities provide it with an advantage over most other memecoins in the market that only survive on community hype. As its presale gains momentum, early buyers believe they‚Äôve found the next breakout star. MAGACOIN is showing all the early signs of a coin preparing to explode once it launches on exchanges. Final Thoughts With DOGE approaching $1 and coins like XRP and PEPE moving fast, meme coin traders are wide awake. But many believe the biggest profits come from getting in early‚Äîand MAGACOIN FINANCE is currently front and center. As long as the hype is real and the roadmap delivers, this underdog might beat its competitors before they even make it to the starting line.

Bloomberg reported Wednesday that Kennedy, who is based in Edinburgh, will oversee Kinexys Digital Assets and Kinexys Labs, two units that focus on asset tokenization and blockchain project development, respectively. She will lead the division alongside Naveen Mallela, who remains in Singapore and will continue to manage the payments side, including Kinexys Digital Payments and Kinexys Liink. JPMorgan Chase has appointed a new global co-head of its blockchain division https://t.co/tvzYdx28uj ‚Äî Bloomberg (@business) August 6, 2025 Before stepping into her new role, Kennedy led digital asset product strategy for JPMorgan‚Äôs securities services business. She brings a background in navigating institutional blockchain adoption and will now take the reins at a time when the bank is expanding its pilot programs in tokenized finance. JPMorgan Expands Blockchain Pilots With JPMD Token and Carbon Credit Platform JPMorgan has been trialling JPMD , a blockchain-based token that represents dollar deposits. In June, it completed its first transfer of JPMD from the bank‚Äôs digital wallet to crypto exchange Coinbase. Since then, the pilot has been ongoing and is expected to continue for several more months. It may then expand to other users and potentially include more currencies, depending on regulatory approval. Last month, Kinexys helped test a new blockchain platform for carbon credits . The pilot involved S&P Global Commodity Insights, EcoRegistry and the International Carbon Registry. Together, they aim to tokenize carbon credits listed in each registry‚Äôs system. This would create a more transparent and traceable market for climate-related assets. Recent US Stablecoin Rules Fuel Institutional Blockchain Momentum Kennedy‚Äôs appointment comes at a time when blockchain adoption is gaining momentum among multinational banks. This shift is being driven by new legislation in the US that sets a legal framework for stablecoins and tokenized deposits. As a result, institutions that once moved cautiously are now accelerating pilot programs. They are also bringing in experienced leaders to guide their efforts. The Kinexys division was carved out of JPMorgan‚Äôs broader Onyx platform. It was then rebranded to better match the bank‚Äôs commercial goals. Now, it unifies tokenization, digital payments and information networks under a single structure. This setup is designed to serve corporates and institutions adopting blockchain-based systems. Industry observers say JPMorgan‚Äôs proactive approach is a clear signal. Large financial institutions are preparing for a future where assets, transactions and data flows exist directly on-chain. Already, tokenized payments, cross-border settlements and carbon credit tracking offer early signs of how these systems might develop.

The ‚ÄòCL‚Äô is an innovative infrastructure protocol based on the Kaia chain that enables simultaneous participation in validator staking and liquidity provision. By integrating Kaia‚Äôs CL technology into the BORA ecosystem, METABORA GAMES will begin full-scale connectivity with external chains through the establishment of a joint liquidity pool, the introduction of a ‚Äògas abstraction‚Äô model (which enables transaction fees to be paid on behalf of users), and the implementation of a fee-burning mechanism. With the completion of the CL integration, METABORA GAMES and the Kaia Foundation established a joint liquidity provision plan and provided approximately $2 million in liquidity as of August 5. The partners plan to further boost the BORA ecosystem and enhance the token‚Äôs value through additional phased liquidity injections. Additionally, a burn mechanism will be applied to the fee revenue generated from the joint liquidity pool. A certain portion of BORA-denominated profits will be burned, reinforcing the ecosystem‚Äôs deflationary tokenomics. The burn rate and frequency will be adjusted flexibly in accordance with market conditions and revenue scale. The integration will also introduce a ‚Äògas abstraction‚Äô feature, allowing users to pay transaction fees on the Kaia mainnet using BORA tokens. This enables users to cover transaction fees with BORA tokens even if they do not hold any Kaia tokens. A METABORA GAMES representative stated, ‚ÄúThe integration of the CL Protocol marks the first step for the BORA chain in achieving functional flexibility and scalability by structurally connecting with external public infrastructure. This signifies a transition and expansion from an independent BORA mainnet model to an interactive structure that engages with external ecosystems.‚Äù They added, ‚ÄúStarting with the launch of mini Dapps based on LINE Messenger and onboarding on Kaia, we will further strengthen BORA‚Äôs tokenomics by expanding external utility and operating an organic burn mechanism that functions seamlessly across multiple chains.‚Äù About METABORA METABORA is a casual game developer and the service operator of the blockchain platform BORA. The BORA ecosystem brings together partners across various industries‚Äîranging from tokenomics and content to blockchain technology‚Äîdriving innovation and collaboration across games, sports, and entertainment. BORA is a national game/entertainment token with a high liquidity in the market and reinforcing the accessibility of users and services abroad by increasing the listing on global cryptocurrency exchanges and expanding partnership.

Realized Cap Shows Divergence Between Ethereum & Bitcoin In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has discussed about how the Realized Cap has changed for some of the assets in the cryptocurrency sector. The ‚Äú Realized Cap ‚Äù refers to a capitalization model that calculates a given coin‚Äôs total value by assuming the ‚Äòtrue‚Äô value of each token in circulation is the spot price at which it was last involved in a transaction. In short, what this indicator represents is the total amount of capital that the investors of the cryptocurrency as a whole have stored into it. Changes in its value, therefore, correspond to the inflow or outflow of capital. Below is the chart shared by Glassnode that shows the 30-day percentage change in the Realized Cap for a few different digital assets. From the graph, it‚Äôs visible that the monthly change in the Realized Cap is currently positive for all four of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and the top memecoins. This suggests that capital has flowed into the market over the last 30 days. Though, while this is true, BTC and SOL have been showing a shift in the short term. One week ago, the Realized Cap change for them stood at 6.66% and 6.34%, respectively. But today, the metric‚Äôs value has come down to 5.46% and 4.84%. Still notably positive, of course, but does reflect a slowdown in demand. Interestingly, while these two tokens have witnessed this trend, ETH has continued its Realized Cap growth with the percentage change jumping from 5.32% to 6.41%. This may be an indication that capital is rotating from other assets into the token number two by market cap . The top meme-based tokens have seen a flat trend in the indicator during the past week, which, according to the analytics firm, is another sign of ‚Äúcooling risk appetite.‚Äù In some other news, both the largest and smallest of investors on the Bitcoin network have been accumulating at the same time recently, as Glassnode has pointed out in another X post . In the chart, the data of the ‚Äú Accumulation Trend Score ‚Äù is shown, which tells us about whether Bitcoin investors are accumulating or distributing. A value close to 1 implies dominant buying, while a value near 0 suggests selling pressure. As is apparent from the graph, the metric‚Äôs value has been pretty close to 1 for both below 1 BTC and above 10,000 BTC investors. ‚ÄúThis suggests initial dip-buying during the recent correction,‚Äù notes the analytics firm. That said, Glassnode also cautions that the signal is lagging, with investor behavior smoothed over a 15-day window. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $115,100, down over 2% in the last seven days.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Realized Cap|btc|BTCUSDT|ETH|Ethereum|Ethereum Realized Cap|SOL|solana,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|SOL|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-07 05:00:20

While Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate headlines, other tokens are offering huge opportunities with fresh incentives, corporate backing, or major network upgrades. These aren‚Äôt speculative shots in the dark; they‚Äôre projects with real traction and plans that are getting investors‚Äô attention. In a market as competitive as this, knowing which assets have upside potential can make a big difference. So let‚Äôs break it down. Here‚Äôs a closer look at four cryptos, BlockDAG, BNB, Solana, and Dogecoin, that deserve your attention in 2025. Each of them brings something different to the table, but all of them are shaping up as serious contenders for anyone building a forward-thinking crypto portfolio this year. 1. BlockDAG: The Presale You Can‚Äôt Ignore If you‚Äôre looking for the best crypto to buy with real upside, BlockDAG is leading the conversation. This presale has already raised around $363 million and sold over 24.6 billion BDAG tokens. For now, the price is still at $0.0016 until August 11, 2025, after which it will reset to about $0.0276, with a final launch price set at $0.05. For early investors, this means a potential 3,025% ROI, making this one of the most attractive entry points in the current market. But the numbers aren‚Äôt the only thing driving interest. BlockDAG has introduced Dashboard V4, turning the presale into a live trading simulation. Buyers can access real-time BDAG/USD charts, live order books, and wallet balance updates, all while still in the presale phase. It‚Äôs designed to give both new and experienced traders a hands-on experience that feels like using a real exchange. To sweeten the deal, BlockDAG has launched a 10 BTC auction running until August 11, with a prize pool worth around $1.1 million. All presale participants automatically enter, and rewards are distributed proportionally based on purchase size. This combination of low entry price, interactive features, and direct incentives makes BlockDAG stand out. For those looking for a token with big potential and strong presale energy, this is arguably the best crypto to buy right now. 2. BNB: Corporate Money and Steady Growth BNB has proven it can hold its ground as a top-tier crypto. Currently priced at around $748.87, it recently weathered a market correction and maintained its position above key support levels. What‚Äôs pushing BNB higher is a surge in corporate treasury acquisitions. Big names like Nano Labs and CEA Industries are scooping up huge amounts of BNB, with plans to deploy billions into BNB-based funds. At the same time, Binance continues to expand its offerings. The launch of a web version of Binance Wallet and extended access to BTC options trading add more utility to the ecosystem, making BNB more than just an exchange token. Analysts are projecting steady gains, with near-term targets of $814 and a bullish outlook that sees the potential for $1,290 if momentum builds. For investors who want a large-cap asset with corporate confidence and platform-driven growth, BNB is still one of the best cryptos to buy in 2025. 3. Solana: Upgrades and Institutional Support Solana, trading at about $161.94, is holding support in the $155‚Äì$160 zone, with key resistance sitting around $171‚Äì$174. If it breaks past that range, a move toward $175‚Äì$190 seems likely in the short term. Institutions are taking notice, too. Bit Mining recently invested around $5 million into Solana and launched its own validator node. Meanwhile, DevvStream Holdings has committed $10 million into Bitcoin and Solana to support its blockchain-based carbon credit initiatives. On the technical side, a significant protocol upgrade with Phylax aims to boost DeFi liquidity and improve network performance, driving growth in Solana‚Äôs ecosystem. Analysts are optimistic about its trajectory, forecasting that Solana could reach the $200‚Äì$300 range by year‚Äôs end, with some predicting a possible climb toward $400 in the next bullish cycle. With strong development activity and institutional backing, Solana is another strong candidate for those considering the best crypto to buy this year. 4. Dogecoin: Still Holding Strong Dogecoin may not have the same buzz it had during its early rallies, but it‚Äôs far from quiet. Priced at about $0.1986, it‚Äôs down roughly 30% from its July highs of $0.28, but large holders are treating this as a buying opportunity. Over 310 million DOGE have been accumulated by institutional wallets during the recent dip, showing that the smart money hasn‚Äôt abandoned it. Futures open interest has also climbed above $3 billion, pointing to growing speculative activity and positioning DOGE for a potential breakout. If it can clear $0.24, the next targets could range between $0.28‚Äì$0.30. Longer-term projections are even more bullish, with some analysts predicting it could reach $1.40 by the end of 2025 under the right market conditions. For those comfortable with volatility and looking for an affordable entry point, Dogecoin still has room to surprise and remains one of the best cryptos to buy in 2025. Summing Up Choosing the best crypto to buy in 2025 means balancing opportunity with strategy. BlockDAG is offering one of the most compelling presales in years, with interactive tools, a Bitcoin reward pool, and a massive ROI potential for early buyers. BNB shows that corporate interest and continued platform growth can keep a large-cap token relevant and promising. Solana‚Äôs network upgrades and institutional backing make it a strong contender for long-term growth, while Dogecoin remains a wildcard with loyal backing and potential for big moves. Whether you‚Äôre seeking a presale with explosive potential or a token with institutional confidence, these four cryptos deserve a spot on your watchlist.

A bonus that supports everyday betting can turn marginal weeks into winning ones. Whether placing bets on football, basketball, or live events, daily bonuses add that extra edge. But many sportsbooks fall short on delivering real daily incentives. This comparison looks at Spartans , Betway, and Betfair to see which platform gives the best daily sports betting bonus in 2025. The focus is on fairness, consistency, and how well each reward suits a daily routine. Spartans Offers a 25% Daily Bonus With Clear Terms and Real Flexibility Spartans offer the only true daily sports bonus among the three. Users can claim a 25% bonus every day on deposits starting from just $10. The bonus works across all sports with only a 1.80 minimum odds condition per selection. A wagering requirement of 8x applies, keeping things clear and manageable for frequent bettors. What makes Spartans stand out is its predictable setup. Bettors know what to expect, no surprise clauses or shifting terms. The bonus can be claimed once a day, and users have three full days to meet the wagering requirement. That extended window gives bettors room to think, plan, and place bets naturally rather than rushing. Spartans also supports fast crypto transactions, allowing global users to fund and withdraw with ease. But beyond convenience, the bonus fits perfectly into the rhythm of daily play. It rewards consistency, gives players full control, and works smoothly with how seasoned users bet each day. Betway‚Äôs Weekly Specials Don‚Äôt Support Daily Betting Habits Betway is known for a wide sportsbook and an easy-to-navigate platform. Yet when it comes to daily rewards, it falls short. Most of its promotions are tied to weekly or seasonal events. Bettors might find odds boosts or combo bet perks, but daily deposit bonuses are not part of the core system. For users who bet every morning, the absence of a regular daily reward can feel limiting. While Betway does roll out decent offers from time to time, they‚Äôre typically campaign-specific and often hidden behind promotion tabs, making them hard to plan around. The lack of routine bonuses makes Betway less suitable for those who value structure in their betting habits. In contrast to Spartans‚Äô reliable approach, Betway seems to focus more on occasional engagement rather than day-to-day support. For daily bettors seeking steady returns, it doesn‚Äôt offer the consistency needed. Betfair‚Äôs Cashback Model Doesn‚Äôt Help Consistent Winners Betfair is a big name in the sportsbook space, best known for its exchange model. When it comes to bonuses, Betfair promotes cashback offers based on losses over certain periods. While this might help newer users or cautious players, it doesn‚Äôt appeal to those who play daily with a win-first mindset. Cashback offers are designed for damage control. They only activate after losses, meaning consistent winners get little or nothing. There‚Äôs no upfront reward for betting daily, and the system doesn‚Äôt incentivize strong, ongoing play. Betfair‚Äôs model lacks the proactive reward structure that daily bettors want. Those who deposit and wager regularly won‚Äôt find any benefit tied to their frequency. When measured against Spartans‚Äô direct and repeatable daily bonus, Betfair‚Äôs cashback scheme simply can‚Äôt compete. It‚Äôs a fallback plan, not a real reward. Spartans Offers the Best Daily Bonus in 2025 Daily sports bettors want a reward system that fits their pace. Spartans deliver exactly that. The 25% bonus is available every day, has fair terms, low deposit requirements, and a practical three-day usage limit. It‚Äôs designed for strategic bettors who don‚Äôt want to be rushed or restricted. Betway has its strengths, but its reliance on weekly promotions means it doesn‚Äôt cater well to everyday users. Betfair‚Äôs cashback model provides some support, but only after losses, offering little value to regular, winning bettors. In 2025, Spartans stands out as the best choice for those looking to boost their daily betting returns with a reliable and easy-to-use bonus.

MUTM is launching with real, on-chain financial tools that will drive sustainable usage from day one. For those who missed out on BNB early, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up to be the next big thing‚Äîexcept it‚Äôs entering the market with much more than an exchange discount. Built-in utility that pays you to participate Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will redefine decentralized lending by combining traditional DeFi structures with advanced tools for passive income and capital efficiency. Its Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model will enable users to earn a consistent yield by depositing blue-chip cryptocurrencies into smart contract-governed liquidity pools. For example, a user who deposits $20,000 worth of MATIC will earn a 10% APY, resulting in $2,000 per year in hands-off passive income. These returns won‚Äôt rely on hype‚Äîthey‚Äôll be driven by actual pool utilization, dynamically adjusting based on borrower demand. After depositing, users will receive mtTokens‚ÄîERC-20 interest-bearing tokens that represent their share of the pool. These tokens will appreciate in value over time as interest accrues and can also be used as collateral to unlock stablecoin liquidity. This dual-purpose design means users won‚Äôt have to choose between earning yield and accessing capital‚Äîthey‚Äôll be able to do both simultaneously, unlocking a new layer of capital efficiency. Beyond pooled lending, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will introduce a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) marketplace, built for risk-tolerant users seeking higher yields or customized terms. Instead of relying on shared pools, individuals will be able to negotiate directly, setting interest rates, durations, and collateral types. This model will be ideal for leveraging lower-cap or speculative assets that fall outside typical DeFi frameworks. For instance, a user could post $2,200 in FLOKI as collateral and borrow $1,500 in USDC, with the agreement automatically enforced through a self-executing smart contract. To safeguard all participants, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs smart contract system will enforce mandatory overcollateralization, monitor collateral health via a built-in Stability Factor, and trigger automatic liquidation if conditions deteriorate. This ensures that even high-risk loans remain contained within predictable, on-chain rules, minimizing systemic risk while maximizing opportunity. Presale acceleration, institutional-grade security, and a 22.8x price outlook Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 6 of its presale, with tokens priced at $0.035. The phase is already 10% sold, and once it reaches full capacity, the price will rise by 15% to $0.040. With a target listing price of $0.06 and an anticipated post-launch projection of $0.80 based on platform utility, growing user base, and exchange exposure, the upside is massive‚Äîmore than 22x from today‚Äôs price. Investors who entered back in Phase 1 at $0.01 have already multiplied their positions by 250%, and there is still room to grow. The platform‚Äôs security is already a standout, with a thorough CertiK audit confirming its smart contract integrity. The Token Scan Score currently stands at 95.00, backed by a CertiK Skynet Score of 78.00. To further reinforce safety, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched a $50,000 bug bounty program with critical bug reports earning up to $2,000 in rewards, ensuring the system is battle-tested before its public rollout. Community strength continues to grow with over 12,000 followers on Twitter and an active $100,000 giveaway campaign where ten early adopters will each win $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. These promotional efforts are rewarding early believers while adding more visibility to the presale. Looking forward, as the beta launch of the platform approaches, interaction rates are expected to surge. Listings on leading exchanges such as Binance, MEXC, KuCoin, or Coinbase will bring even more eyes and users into the ecosystem, helping drive demand and price momentum. With a limited total supply of 4 billion tokens and real DeFi functionality at its core, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just another altcoin‚Äîit is a capital engine in motion. BNB started as a simple discount token for traders. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is beginning its journey as a revenue-generating platform for the entire crypto economy. At just $0.035, it offers more utility, stronger tokenomics, and a clearer path to adoption than BNB had at the same price level.

SOL price is now consolidating gains and might aim for more gains above the $172 zone. SOL price started a fresh upward move above the $165 and $166 levels against the US Dollar. The price is now trading above $165 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a contracting triangle forming with resistance at $168 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $172 resistance zone. Solana Price Eyes Upside Break Solana price started a decent increase after it found support near the $162 zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . SOL climbed above the $165 level to enter a short-term positive zone. The price even smashed the $1682 resistance. The bulls were able to push the price above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $172 swing high to the $162 low. However, the bears are active near the $170 zone. The 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $172 swing high to the $162 low is acting as a resistance. There is also a contracting triangle forming with resistance at $168 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. Solana is now trading above $165 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $170 level. The next major resistance is near the $172 level. The main resistance could be $175. A successful close above the $175 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $182. Any more gains might send the price toward the $192 level. Are Downsides Limited In SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $170 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $164 zone. The first major support is near the $162 level. A break below the $162 level might send the price toward the $152 support zone. If there is a close below the $150 support, the price could decline toward the $145 support in the near term.

BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) led with $426.22 million, while Fidelity‚Äôs FETH added $35.01 million. Total ETH ETF assets now exceed $10 billion, about 4% of Ethereum‚Äôs market cap. ETH‚Äôs price rose 10% to ~$3,871, driven by institutional demand and whale accumulation, including a $114 million buy by wallet 0xF436. Technical indicators show ETH testing $4,000 resistance, with support at $3,824. Despite $2.2 billion in staking withdrawals, optimism around the Pectra upgrade and regulatory clarity fuels sentiment. However, a bearish MACD and profit-taking risks could cap gains. A breakout above $4,100 may target $4,500. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for institutional and retail growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs strength will lie in its versatile dual lending model, crafted to serve diverse user needs within the crypto lending space. On one hand, its Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pools will enable investors to deposit stablecoins and blue-chip tokens such as USDC, ETH, or AVAX, earning steady APY yields while receiving mtTokens that will represent their share and accumulate staking rewards (in MUTM) if staked in the smart contracts. This system will be attractive to institutional players seeking reliable returns with transparent risk profiles. On the other hand, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will open doors to a speculative frontier through its Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending, allowing high-risk memecoins like PEPE, TRUMP, and DOGE to be used as collateral. This segment will empower users to negotiate customized loan terms with higher interest rates, creating an inclusive financial rail that will accommodate a broad spectrum of risk appetites without mixing risk pools. This segregation will reduce systemic risk and enhance user confidence, making MUTM an appealing token for both conservative and aggressive investors. Currently in its Phase 6 presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens are offered at $0.035, with 10% of the total supply sold to over 14,800 holders, and $14.1 million raised. Early Phase 1 investors are enjoying 3.5x paper gains as the price prepares to jump to the upcoming listing price of $0.06. The platform‚Äôs beta launch is set to coincide with this listing, bringing to market full user functionality and anticipated liquidity boosts. This upcoming beta will activate core lending, borrowing, and staking features on Layer-2 networks, delivering the speed and low fees that institutional and retail users demand. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs roadmap points to significant milestones in decentralized stablecoin issuance, where stablecoins are minted only during collateral-backed loans and burned upon repayment. This mechanism will generate continuous on-chain volume, creating a powerful feedback loop of utility that supports long-term token demand. Roadmap and security foundations support a $2 target with realistic growth drivers Security remains a top priority for Mutuum Finance (MUTM), reflected in its CertiK audit, which awarded the project an impressive score of 95, alongside a Skynet rating of 78. This rigorous third-party verification gives investors confidence that the protocol‚Äôs smart contracts and Layer-2 integrations maintain high standards for safety and resilience. Looking at the broader market, Layer-2 projects with similar technical and functional profiles have demonstrated exponential growth, often realizing 10x to 20x returns post-launch once utility and liquidity mature. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs structured four-phase roadmap‚Äîfrom ongoing smart contract development and audit to launch, exchange listings, and liquidity mining‚Äîmirrors these success trajectories. Beyond the upcoming beta, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is targeting listings on respected exchanges such as Kraken and KuCoin, which will significantly increase token accessibility and trading volume. These listings, combined with growing community momentum including over 12,000 Twitter followers and a $100,000 MUTM token giveaway , set the stage for a rapid adoption cycle. Final words Investors should note that MUTM‚Äôs growth is driven by tangible developments, not hype. The token‚Äôs utility will deepen as more users participate in both P2C and P2P lending, staking rewards, and stablecoin minting. This creates real demand fueled by active usage rather than speculative pumps. Given the solid foundation and layered roadmap progress, analysts projecting a $2 target for MUTM by mid-2026 base their outlook on achievable milestones and real-world adoption, indicating a trajectory that outpaces ETH price appreciation in the same timeframe. With Ethereum (ETH)‚Äôs institutional inflows laying a fertile ground, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a compelling opportunity for investors seeking next-level exposure to DeFi innovation. As the presale nears its next phase with a planned price increase to $0.040, the window to secure tokens at the discounted $0.035 price is closing fast. This strategic entry point, combined with Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs robust platform features and forthcoming liquidity events, makes MUTM one of the most promising under-$0.05 tokens to watch in 2025 and beyond.

He suggests that GameStop (GME), once the poster child of meme stock frenzy, now surprisingly mirrors Bitcoin (BTC) as its volatility dramatically declines. This intriguing insight into GameStop Bitcoin volatility challenges previous perceptions and signals a potential new chapter for the retail trading favorite. What‚Äôs Driving This GME Bitcoin Comparison? Bill Gross, co-founder of investment management firm PIMCO, shared his unique perspective in an interview with Business Insider. He noted that GameStop‚Äôs price action over the past year has become remarkably stable, trading consistently between $20 and $35. This steady pattern stands in stark contrast to its explosive 2021 surge, which saw GME skyrocket from under $1 in 2020 to $121 in January 2021. Declining Volatility: GME‚Äôs price swings are now significantly reduced. Stable Trading Range: A consistent $20-$35 band for over a year. Mirroring Bitcoin: This new stability echoes Bitcoin‚Äôs own price movements, particularly its consolidation phases. Gross emphasizes that this behavior makes GME resemble Bitcoin more than a typical meme stock. The wild, unpredictable swings that defined its meme status have largely subsided, indicating a potential maturity in its market dynamics. This fascinating GME Bitcoin comparison highlights a significant shift. The Remarkable Decline in GameStop Bitcoin Volatility The transformation of GameStop from a highly volatile, unpredictable asset to one showing surprising stability is indeed remarkable. For many investors, the idea of comparing GameStop to Bitcoin, a leading cryptocurrency, might seem unusual. However, Bill Gross Bitcoin observations highlight a significant shift in GME‚Äôs market behavior. Bitcoin itself has experienced periods of intense volatility, but also extended phases of consolidation and more predictable movements. GME‚Äôs recent performance, staying within a defined range, suggests that the speculative fervor that once drove its price has cooled. This reduced GameStop Bitcoin volatility could be a sign of a more mature investor base or simply a market finding its equilibrium after extreme events. From Meme to Mature? GME‚Äôs journey from a speculative frenzy to a more stable asset. Predictable Patterns: Investors can observe clearer support and resistance levels. Investment Implications: Reduced volatility might appeal to a broader range of investors seeking less speculative opportunities. This unexpected parallel prompts us to reconsider how we categorize and analyze assets that have been at the center of retail trading phenomena. What Does This Mean for GameStop‚Äôs Market Evolution? Bill Gross Bitcoin insight points to a fascinating aspect of GameStop market evolution . If GME is indeed shedding its ‚Äúmeme stock‚Äù label and adopting price characteristics akin to Bitcoin, what does this imply for its future? This shift suggests that the market may be treating GameStop less as a speculative bet and more as an asset with established trading patterns. This GME Bitcoin comparison could mean: Increased Predictability: More stable price action allows for more traditional technical analysis. Wider Investor Appeal: Reduced risk might attract institutional investors or those previously wary of its extreme swings. Broader Crypto Market Trends: If GME mirrors Bitcoin, it might indirectly reflect broader sentiment or liquidity flows within the digital asset space, even if not directly tied to blockchain technology. It‚Äôs a testament to how markets adapt and evolve, even for assets that once defied conventional analysis. The ‚ÄúBond King‚Äôs‚Äù perspective offers a fresh lens through which to view GameStop‚Äôs place in the evolving financial landscape. Conclusion: A New Chapter for GameStop? Bill Gross‚Äôs compelling analysis truly offers a fresh perspective on GameStop. By highlighting the dramatic decline in GameStop Bitcoin volatility and its new, surprising resemblance to Bitcoin‚Äôs price patterns, he challenges the enduring ‚Äúmeme stock‚Äù narrative. This shift suggests GME may be entering a more mature phase, characterized by greater stability and potentially broader appeal beyond its dedicated retail base. As markets continue to evolve, understanding these unexpected parallels becomes crucial for investors navigating the complex interplay between traditional and digital assets.

Utilizing the Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP), this upgrade enables seamless USDC transfers across Avalanche (AVAX), Ethereum, and Base, eliminating costly bridge reliance. Supporting $219 billion in USDC trading volume, the integration has boosted Avalanche (AVAX)‚Äôs DeFi ecosystem, with TVL reaching $2 billion, per Invezz. Visa‚Äôs recent support for USDC settlement on Avalanche (AVAX) further strengthens its role in bridging traditional finance and Web3. Despite a recent dip to $21.41, AVAX‚Äôs trading volume spiked 40% to $1.2 billion. Technical indicators show support at $20.39 and resistance at $27.38, with an overbought RSI (72) suggesting a potential pullback. Avalanche (AVAX)‚Äôs low-fee, high-speed infrastructure positions it as a DeFi leader, though validator centralization remains a concern. Meeting the demand: Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs Layer-2 lending innovation Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is strategically positioned to meet the growing market needs exemplified by Avalanche (AVAX)‚Äôs USDC growth. Its platform uniquely combines a Layer-2 scalability solution with a dual lending system that optimizes both security and returns. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending mode will be especially noteworthy, allowing users to deposit stablecoins such as USDC and receive yield-generating mtTokens on a 1:1 basis. These mtTokens don‚Äôt just earn interest; they can also be staked in the designated smart contracts to earn dividends in MUTM tokens, creating multiple income streams for holders and strengthening the token‚Äôs ecosystem. What sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart is its design focused on scalability without compromising decentralization or security. The upcoming beta launch on Layer-2 will give users a firsthand experience with the platform‚Äôs speed and efficiency, pushing demand for MUTM tokens higher. This Layer-2 integration is a game-changer for users wanting to avoid the high fees and slow confirmations typical of many Layer-1 blockchains. In the middle of this promising outlook sits Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs current presale. With the token priced at $0.035 and over 14,800 holders already onboard, Phase 6 has seen 10% of its tokens sold, generating approximately $14.10 million in funding. This momentum isn‚Äôt just numbers; it reflects real investor confidence as MUTM prepares for its planned price increase to $0.040 in the upcoming phase. The combination of an attractive entry price and upcoming utility-driven catalysts makes MUTM a compelling choice for investors. A real investor success story and the roadmap ahead To illustrate Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs potential, consider an Avalanche (AVAX) investor who allocated $8,000 to MUTM during Phase 1, when the price was just $0.01. By the time MUTM reaches its expected listing price of $0.06, this investor‚Äôs position will have appreciated by 500%, turning that initial stake into $48,000. This example highlights not only the token‚Äôs strong growth prospects but also how early participation in Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs presale phases rewards forward-thinking investors with significant upside. Beyond price appreciation, the broader roadmap reinforces the token‚Äôs value proposition. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is committed to delivering on its promises with a structured rollout plan encompassing four detailed phases. These include progressive development milestones, the launch of their Layer-2 beta, the implementation of their decentralized stablecoin, and strategic listings on major exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance, KuCoin, MEXC, and Kraken. Each of these steps is designed to increase platform utility, user adoption, and ultimately, the demand for MUTM tokens. Confidence in Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs security and technology is further bolstered by its CertiK audit, which awarded it a Token Scan Score of 95. The audit process involved thorough manual reviews and static analysis, underscoring the project‚Äôs commitment to transparency and safety. This assurance helps build trust among potential investors who value rigorously tested smart contracts in today‚Äôs volatile crypto environment. Huge MUTM giveaway With a $100,000 giveaway and an active social media following exceeding 12,000 Twitter users, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is cultivating a vibrant community eager to support and engage with the platform‚Äôs growth. The current Phase 6, already 10% sold out, combined with the planned 15% price increase in the next phase, creates a strong sense of urgency among investors not to miss out on acquiring MUTM tokens at this discounted rate. As Avalanche (AVAX) continues to boost USDC adoption and reinforce the market for scalable DeFi solutions, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers an opportunity for investors to get ahead of the curve. With its innovative Layer-2 scaling, dual lending model, and clearly defined roadmap, MUTM is poised to deliver substantial growth and become a leading player in the evolving DeFi landscape. The time to act is now, while the token remains undervalued and its ecosystem is gearing up for a major breakthrough.

The recent implementation of new trade tariffs, particularly those involving major global economies, has sent a palpable tremor through the Forex Market Impact . While digital assets like Bitcoin often march to their own beat, macro-economic shifts, especially those affecting major fiat currencies, can indirectly influence investor sentiment and capital flows within the crypto space. Understanding these broader market movements is crucial for any investor looking to navigate the interconnected financial landscape. Understanding the Initial Shockwaves: What‚Äôs Muting Asia FX? The immediate aftermath of the new tariffs saw Asian currencies react with a cautious, almost muted response. This apparent calm, however, belies underlying anxieties and strategic positioning by central banks and investors alike. The imposition of tariffs by the United States on goods from key Asian economies has directly impacted export-reliant nations, leading to a slowdown in trade volumes and, consequently, a dampening effect on their respective currencies. The Trade War Tensions have forced many Asian central banks to consider intervention to stabilize their exchange rates, preventing excessive appreciation or depreciation that could further harm their economies. Consider the situation in China, where the Yuan has been under significant pressure. While direct intervention might not always be explicit, the People‚Äôs Bank of China (PBOC) has tools at its disposal to guide the currency. Other regional currencies, such as the South Korean Won, the Indonesian Rupiah, and the Indian Rupee, have also felt the squeeze. The muted reaction often reflects a wait-and-see approach, coupled with strategic efforts to manage market expectations. Key Factors Contributing to Muted Asia FX: Export Dependence: Many Asian economies are heavily reliant on exports, making them vulnerable to tariff impositions. Reduced demand for their goods translates to lower foreign currency earnings. Capital Outflows: Uncertainty stemming from trade disputes can trigger capital flight from emerging Asian markets as investors seek safer havens, putting downward pressure on local currencies. Central Bank Intervention: To prevent sharp currency movements that could destabilize their economies, central banks often step in, either by selling foreign reserves or adjusting interest rates, leading to a ‚Äòmuted‚Äô appearance rather than wild swings. Economic Slowdown Concerns: The tariffs threaten to slow down economic growth across the region, which naturally weakens the appeal of these currencies to international investors. The Dollar‚Äôs Dilemma: Why is US Dollar Strength Nursing Losses? Paradoxically, despite the US being the initiator of these tariffs, the US Dollar Strength has not been as robust as some might expect. While the dollar traditionally acts as a safe-haven currency during global uncertainties, the current scenario presents a more nuanced picture. The very tariffs designed to protect domestic industries are simultaneously creating headwinds for American businesses, particularly those reliant on global supply chains or export markets. This creates a ‚Äòdouble-edged sword‚Äô effect for the dollar. One major factor is the impact on corporate earnings. US companies with significant international operations are facing higher costs due to tariffs on imported components and reduced demand for their exports due to retaliatory tariffs. This can dampen investor confidence in US equities, subsequently affecting the dollar. Furthermore, market expectations regarding the Federal Reserve‚Äôs monetary policy play a critical role. If the trade war escalates and threatens US economic growth, the Fed might be compelled to adopt a more dovish stance, potentially leading to interest rate cuts. Lower interest rates typically reduce the attractiveness of holding dollar-denominated assets, thus weakening the currency. Challenges to Sustained US Dollar Strength: Economic Slowdown Risk: Tariffs can increase consumer prices and reduce corporate profits, potentially slowing US economic growth. Monetary Policy Expectations: Growing concerns about economic growth can lead to expectations of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, diminishing the dollar‚Äôs yield advantage. Global Retaliation: Other nations imposing retaliatory tariffs can harm US exports and multinational corporations, impacting the dollar‚Äôs underlying economic support. Fiscal Deficit Concerns: Increased government spending combined with potential revenue shortfalls due to trade disruptions can exacerbate the US fiscal deficit, raising long-term concerns for the dollar. Beyond Tariffs: How Are Trade War Tensions Reshaping Global Commerce? The ongoing Trade War Tensions extend far beyond the direct imposition of tariffs. They are fundamentally reshaping global supply chains, investment patterns, and the very fabric of international commerce. Businesses are now re-evaluating their manufacturing locations, sourcing strategies, and market access in response to increased uncertainty and protectionist policies. This strategic shift is leading to a significant re-alignment of global economic partnerships and trade routes. Companies that once thrived on efficient, interconnected global supply chains are now facing pressure to diversify their production bases or even reshore operations to mitigate tariff risks. This process is costly and time-consuming, leading to disruptions in production and higher consumer prices. Furthermore, the uncertainty discourages long-term foreign direct investment (FDI), as businesses are hesitant to commit capital in an unpredictable trade environment. The World Trade Organization (WTO), once a cornerstone of multilateral trade, finds its authority challenged, signaling a potential move towards more bilateral or regional trade agreements. Impact of Trade War Tensions on Global Commerce: Aspect Impact Example Supply Chains Diversification, Reshoring, Increased Costs Tech companies moving production out of China. Investment Reduced FDI, Increased Uncertainty Companies delaying new factory constructions abroad. Trade Volume Overall Decline, Shifting Trade Routes Decreased global shipping container traffic. International Relations Strained Partnerships, Rise of Bilateral Deals Increased focus on regional trade blocs over global ones. Navigating the Currents: What‚Äôs the Asia Currency Outlook Amidst Uncertainty? The Asia Currency Outlook remains a focal point of discussion among economists and investors. While the initial reaction was muted, the long-term implications of trade disputes could lead to more pronounced currency movements. Countries with strong domestic demand and less reliance on exports to the US might fare better. For instance, nations like India, with a large internal market, might be more resilient than export-heavy economies such as Vietnam or South Korea, although no country is entirely immune. Central banks in Asia are walking a tightrope, balancing the need to support economic growth with maintaining currency stability. Some may resort to capital controls or direct market interventions to prevent speculative attacks or excessive depreciation. The ongoing situation could also accelerate regional economic integration efforts, as Asian nations seek to bolster intra-regional trade to offset declining demand from Western markets. This could lead to a stronger reliance on currencies like the Chinese Yuan within the region, potentially challenging the dollar‚Äôs traditional dominance in Asian trade. Key Considerations for Asia Currency Outlook: Export Diversification: Countries successfully diversifying their export markets away from the US may see more stable currencies. Domestic Demand Strength: Economies with robust internal consumption can better withstand external shocks. Central Bank Reserves: Nations with substantial foreign exchange reserves have greater capacity to intervene and stabilize their currencies. Regional Trade Blocs: Increased integration within ASEAN or other Asian trade agreements could foster currency stability through increased intra-regional trade. Broader Horizons: What Does This Mean for the Global Economic Outlook? The cumulative effect of these trade disputes on the Global Economic Outlook is a cause for concern among international organizations and financial institutions. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank have repeatedly warned about the downside risks posed by escalating protectionism. A sustained period of trade friction could lead to a significant slowdown in global GDP growth, potentially pushing some economies into recession. Beyond the direct economic impact, there‚Äôs a risk of diminished global cooperation on other critical issues, such as climate change or financial stability, as nations become more inward-looking. Investors are increasingly seeking safe-haven assets like gold or certain government bonds, while re-evaluating their exposure to equity markets, particularly those tied to global trade. The overall Forex Market Impact is characterized by increased volatility and a tendency for capital to flow towards perceived safety, even if that safety comes with lower returns. This environment necessitates careful portfolio management and a deep understanding of geopolitical shifts. Potential Scenarios for the Global Economic Outlook: Base Case (Slowdown): Continued trade tensions lead to slower global growth, but a full-blown recession is avoided through policy adjustments and resilience. Worst Case (Recession): Escalation of trade wars, coupled with other geopolitical shocks, triggers a synchronized global recession. Best Case (De-escalation): A swift resolution to trade disputes, perhaps through new agreements, leads to a rebound in confidence and growth. Actionable Insights for Investors: How Can You Adapt? In an environment shaped by trade tariffs and shifting currency dynamics, investors need to be agile and informed. Here are some actionable insights: Diversify Your Portfolio: Beyond traditional asset classes, consider geographical diversification. Look into markets less directly exposed to the immediate trade tensions. Monitor Key Indicators: Keep a close eye on manufacturing PMIs, export data, and central bank statements from major economies. These provide early signals of economic health and policy direction. Consider Safe-Haven Assets: Gold, certain government bonds, and even some stablecoins (if you are in the crypto space) can act as hedges against volatility in traditional markets. Stay Informed on Geopolitics: Economic outcomes are increasingly tied to political decisions. Understanding the geopolitical landscape is as crucial as economic fundamentals. Embrace Long-Term Perspective: While short-term volatility is inevitable, focusing on long-term trends and strong fundamentals can help weather market storms. Avoid knee-jerk reactions to daily news cycles. Conclusion The current landscape, marked by muted Asia FX and a struggling US Dollar Strength amidst escalating Trade War Tensions, underscores the profound Forex Market Impact of protectionist policies. The ripple effects are undeniable, influencing the Asia Currency Outlook and casting a shadow over the entire Global Economic Outlook . While the immediate reactions might appear subtle, the long-term consequences are likely to be far-reaching, necessitating a strategic reassessment by businesses, policymakers, and investors worldwide. Navigating this complex environment requires vigilance, adaptability, and a comprehensive understanding of the interconnected forces at play. As the global economy continues to grapple with these challenges, staying informed and making calculated decisions will be paramount for financial resilience.

One of the biggest Ethereum whales moved this enormous sum, and while the exact reason behind the transfer isn‚Äôt publicly known, it has sparked widespread speculation about what might come next for Ethereum‚Äîand potentially for XRP too. Traders are watching closely because these moves often come just before major market shifts. With Ethereum gaining strength, XRP quietly building momentum, and altcoins starting to wake up, some investors are looking beyond the mainstream‚Äîand turning their attention to promising new projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE . Ethereum‚Äôs Strong Momentum Builds Confidence Ethereum has had an impressive comeback this year. In early August 2025, ETH climbed above $3,700 and delivered over 50% gains in just one month. That‚Äôs a huge leap compared to Bitcoin‚Äôs gain during the same period. The rally has been fueled by strong inflows into Ethereum ETFs, growing adoption in DeFi, and increased interest from large institutions. Many analysts now believe Ethereum could continue this upward trend, especially with major players like BlackRock increasing their ETH holdings. The recent whale transfer might be another sign that big investors are preparing for another major leg up. XRP‚Äôs Quiet Strength May Be Underestimated While XRP hasn‚Äôt made as much noise as Ethereum recently, it‚Äôs still one of the most closely watched altcoins. After years of legal uncertainty, the Ripple team has finally cleared many regulatory hurdles, giving investors renewed confidence in the project. XRP is now showing steady price strength, holding support levels and building quietly behind the scenes. Its focus on global payments and strong partnerships in the banking sector continue to give it long-term value. If Ethereum rallies further, it could trigger a broader altcoin push‚Äîone that XRP is well positioned to ride. ETH and XRP Look Strong‚ÄîBut MAGACOIN FINANCE Aims for 14,900% Gains As Ethereum and XRP capture headlines, a new name is quickly emerging in the crypto space: MAGACOIN FINANCE . This up-and-coming DeFi project is gaining serious momentum, especially among early investors looking for top crypto investments in 2025 and beyond. Early forecasts suggest that MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver up to 14,900% gains for early investors, thanks to its innovative DeFi features, powerful tokenomics, and fast-growing community. It‚Äôs still in its early stages, which means getting in now could be like catching Ethereum or XRP in their early days‚Äîbefore they became household names. Final Thoughts A $300 million Ethereum whale move is more than just a big transaction‚Äîit‚Äôs a signal that serious players are positioning for what could be the next big crypto rally. Ethereum is gaining steam, XRP is quietly building strength, and new projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are creating fresh excitement in the space. The presale is currently live, and interest is picking up fast. For those who missed out on the early days of Ethereum or XRP, MAGACOIN FINANCE could offer a second chance to get in early on a major winner.

Many investors are keenly watching for signs of what‚Äôs next for the leading digital asset. A prominent voice in the crypto space has recently shared his insights, suggesting that while some short-term pressures have eased, the broader bullish trend for Bitcoin remains intact. Has Short-Term Overheating Subsided for the BTC Market Outlook? According to Crypto Dan, a well-regarded crypto analyst and contributor to CryptoQuant, Bitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) recent short-term overheating has indeed subsided. This is a crucial development for the overall BTC market outlook . He noted on his official Telegram channel that Bitcoin‚Äôs market conditions have returned to levels seen before its notable rebound in June. What‚Äôs particularly interesting is that this occurred without any major price corrections, indicating a healthy rebalancing rather than a crash. This observation offers a sigh of relief for many, as rapid price increases often lead to concerns about unsustainable growth. The market appears to have naturally absorbed some of the speculative heat, allowing for a more stable foundation moving forward. What‚Äôs Impacting Current Bitcoin Price Action? Despite the cooling of short-term overheating, Bitcoin has recently shown a rather sluggish trajectory. This can be largely attributed to significant capital outflows from spot BTC Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). These outflows suggest that institutional and larger retail investors might be taking a cautious stance or reallocating their portfolios, which naturally impacts the Bitcoin price action . It‚Äôs important to understand that ETF flows are a significant indicator of institutional interest and broader market sentiment. When these funds experience net outflows, it can create selling pressure and dampen price momentum. However, this period of ‚Äúfunk,‚Äù as the analyst describes it, doesn‚Äôt necessarily signal the end of the current bull run. It might simply be a phase of consolidation or a temporary pause as the market digests recent gains and adjusts to new capital dynamics. Is the Current Bitcoin Bull Cycle Truly Over? A Crypto Analyst View From a broader perspective, Crypto Dan firmly believes that the current Bitcoin bull cycle is far from over. This is a reassuring sentiment for long-term holders and those looking to enter the market. Despite some indicators still showing signs of previous overheating, the analyst maintains that the overall likelihood of BTC entering a significant downturn remains low. His crypto analyst view suggests that the underlying fundamentals supporting Bitcoin‚Äôs growth are still strong. This perspective encourages investors to look beyond daily fluctuations and focus on the larger market trends and Bitcoin‚Äôs enduring value proposition. Key takeaways from this expert perspective include: Market Rebalancing: The short-term overheating has resolved without a crash. Temporary Slowdown: ETF outflows contribute to current sluggishness, but it‚Äôs not a fundamental collapse. Long-Term Optimism: The broader bull cycle narrative remains intact. Navigating the Market: What‚Äôs Next for This Crypto Market Analysis? For investors, understanding this nuanced outlook is key. While the market might continue to experience periods of ‚Äúfunk‚Äù or sideways movement, the overarching theme, according to this crypto market analysis , is one of continued bullish potential. This doesn‚Äôt mean Bitcoin will see explosive growth every day, but rather that its long-term upward trajectory is still in play. It‚Äôs crucial for market participants to: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on key indicators and expert opinions, like this crypto analyst view . Manage Expectations: Recognize that market cycles involve periods of consolidation. Consider Long-Term Strategy: Avoid panic selling based on short-term dips in Bitcoin price action . The market is dynamic, and while the path may not always be smooth, the foundational strength of Bitcoin and the broader crypto ecosystem appears robust, supporting the ongoing Bitcoin bull cycle . Summary: Crypto Dan‚Äôs analysis provides a calming perspective amidst recent market sluggishness. He asserts that Bitcoin‚Äôs short-term overheating has naturally subsided, preventing a major correction. Despite recent capital outflows impacting Bitcoin price action , his expert crypto analyst view is that the current Bitcoin bull cycle is not over. This comprehensive crypto market analysis suggests that while periods of ‚Äúfunk‚Äù may persist, the long-term outlook for BTC remains positive, offering a strong foundation for continued growth rather than a significant downturn. Power Word: Resilient Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does ‚Äúshort-term overheating‚Äù in BTC mean? A1: Short-term overheating refers to a rapid and unsustainable price increase in Bitcoin, often driven by excessive speculation, which can lead to a sharp correction. When it ‚Äúsubsides,‚Äù it means the market has rebalanced without a significant crash, improving the overall BTC market outlook . Q2: Why have spot BTC ETFs seen capital outflows? A2: Capital outflows from spot BTC ETFs can occur for various reasons, including investors taking profits, rebalancing portfolios, or reacting to broader economic uncertainties. These outflows indicate a decrease in demand from institutional investors and can impact Bitcoin price action . Q3: What indicates that the Bitcoin bull cycle is not over? A3: According to the analyst, despite some signs of overheating and current sluggishness, the underlying market structure and broader trends suggest the Bitcoin bull cycle‚Äôs continuation. This view often considers long-term adoption, technological advancements, and macro factors over short-term price movements. Q4: How should investors react to the current ‚Äúfunk‚Äù in the market? A4: Investors should focus on long-term strategies, avoid panic selling, and stay informed. Periods of sluggishness are normal in market cycles and do not necessarily signal the end of a bull run. It can even present opportunities for those with a long-term perspective, according to this crypto market analysis . Q5: What is the significance of a ‚Äúcrypto analyst view‚Äù in understanding market trends? A5: A crypto analyst view provides expert interpretation of complex market data and indicators. Analysts like Crypto Dan use their experience and tools to offer insights into potential future movements, helping investors make more informed decisions by looking beyond daily volatility.

It continues to steal the spotlight after revealing key details about its upcoming wallet and building momentum with its $250,000 giveaway.

With growing interest in high-growth crypto assets that combine real-world utility with low gas fees, the Remittix DeFi project is shaping up to be a clear contender in the battle for the best crypto to buy in 2025. Solana Price Rebounds But Faces Pressure From Upstarts Solana price jumped back above $165 after a week of mild selloffs, supported by renewed NFT market activity and a slight uptick in DeFi volume. A partnership announcement with Render Network helped strengthen sentiment, with users applauding Solana‚Äôs fast settlement times and low transaction fees. Solana price prediction shows that it maintains a higher low structure and is currently forming a bullish reversal from a key ascending trendline. With this, it currently has targets of $260, $312 and $356. Cardano Price Sees Modest Gains Amid Technical Strength The Cardano price currently sits around $0.74, up 3% in the last 48 hours after founder Charles Hoskinson hinted at a ‚Äúbig September announcement.‚Äù ADA continues to see solid staking interest and long-term holder confidence, but short-term price action remains range-bound. Experts have pointed out that Cardano is pacing itself with deliberate, infrastructure-first growth. With this, Cardano price momentum is building quietly. Analysts now expect a bullish move toward $2.36 . Why Remittix Is The Best Crypto To Buy Right Now While Solana and Cardano price continue making headlines, it‚Äôs Remittix that‚Äôs quietly stealing the thunder. Built as a cross-chain DeFi project for global payments, Remittix isn‚Äôt about hype but is about solving a real-world $19 trillion settlement problem.

Other analysts, including Arthur Hayes and Joe Burnett, also have optimistic targets, while firms like Bernstein and Standard Chartered expect more modest gains around $200,000. Meanwhile, IREN Ltd outperformed industry heavyweight MARA in July by mining more Bitcoin despite having a smaller hashrate. The mining firm also saw its stock rally 11.4% as it expands into AI cloud services. Bitcoin Could Hit $250K in 2025 Fundstrat co-founder and BitMine chairman Tom Lee once again talked about his bullish stance on Bitcoin, and predicted that the leading cryptocurrency could still surge to $250,000 by the end of 2025. In an interview on the Coin Stories podcast with Natalie Brunell , Lee shared that he is confident that Bitcoin will build momentum before the year concludes, and suggested a range between $200,000 and $250,000 is within reach. This projection was made after his previous call in November of 2024, when he gave Bitcoin a 12-month window to hit the $250,000 mark. While Lee is clearly still very optimistic, other analysts started to adopt more tempered expectations. Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, and Joe Burnett of Unchained have similar bullish targets , but firms like Bernstein and Standard Chartered set their year-end forecasts at $200,000. Meanwhile, 10x Research‚Äôs Markus Thielen presented a more conservative estimate of $160,000. These varied predictions come during the broader debate about the relevance of Bitcoin‚Äôs historical four-year halving cycle. Lee argues that institutional adoption is reshaping Bitcoin‚Äôs trajectory, which could possibly render traditional market cycles less predictive. Still, not everyone agrees. Analyst Rekt Capital recently said that if Bitcoin mirrors its 2020 performance, the market could peak around October 2025, which is roughly 550 days after the latest halving event in April of 2024. On the other hand, Matt Hougan , chief investment officer at Bitwise, went as far as to call the four-year halving cycle ‚Äúdead,‚Äù and projected that 2026 could instead be Bitcoin‚Äôs next major growth year. Despite the uncertainty, Lee sees the current skepticism in the market as a positive force. He believes that widespread doubt leaves room for positive surprises and sustained price discovery. Crypto Fear and Greed Index (Source: Alternative ) The recent shift in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index from ‚ÄúGreed‚Äù to ‚ÄúNeutral‚Äù also reflects this growing caution among investors. Still, Lee is quite steadfast in his long-term view, and ultimately predicted Bitcoin could reach $1 million ‚Äúover time‚Äù as adoption and institutional interest continue to grow. IREN Tops MARA in July BTC Mining In other Bitcoin-related news, shares of Bitcoin mining firm IREN Ltd surged 11.4% on Wednesday after the company reported strong July results. This included $86 million in revenue and the production of 728 Bitcoin. IREN Bitcoin mined (Source: IREN ) Interestingly, this output was more than that of industry giant MARA Holdings, which mined 703 BTC during the same period despite operating a larger deployed hashrate of 58.9 exahashes per second (EH/s) compared to IREN‚Äôs 50 EH/s. IREN‚Äôs average hashrate for the month was 45.4 EH/s, which indicates high operational efficiency and machine uptime despite rising mining difficulty and energy costs that recently pressured the sector‚Äôs profitability. MARA‚Äôs performance, although trailing IREN in July production, came after a robust second-quarter earnings report showing a 64% year-on-year revenue increase to $238 million. MARA also maintains the second-largest corporate Bitcoin treasury by holding 50,000 BTC , second only to Michael Saylor‚Äôs Strategy. After the announcement, IREN shares closed at $18.32, which pushed its market cap to $4.11 billion. This positioned IREN as the second most valuable publicly traded Bitcoin miner, surpassing both Riot Platforms and Core Scientific, and trailing only MARA. The stock‚Äôs strong performance also proves that there is growing investor confidence in IREN‚Äôs strategy to diversify beyond Bitcoin mining. IREN‚Äôs share price over the past 24 hours (Source: Google Finance ) A $2.3 million of IREN‚Äôs July revenue came from its AI cloud business, which is becoming an important part of its operations. The company recently acquired 2,400 of NVIDIA‚Äôs advanced Blackwell GPUs, with 256 units already delivered. Co-founder and co-CEO Daniel Roberts pointed out the strong market interest in the AI segment, and believes the synergy between running Bitcoin mining and AI infrastructure side-by-side is a strategic advantage. IREN‚Äôs turnaround is particularly impressive when considering it was labeled ‚Äúwildly overvalued‚Äù last year by short-selling firm Culper Research. The firm criticized IREN‚Äôs AI ambitions, and even compared them to attempting a Grand Prix in a Toyota Prius. However, since bottoming at $5.59 in April, IREN‚Äôs stock rallied over 227%, defying the earlier skepticism.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|MINING|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-07 05:30:00

Binance, a leader in the digital asset space, consistently provides transparency through its monthly Binance Proof of Reserves reports. These reports offer a fascinating glimpse into the platform‚Äôs holdings, assuring users about the backing of their assets and fostering trust in the ecosystem. Unpacking Binance‚Äôs August Proof of Reserves Report Binance recently released its 33rd Proof of Reserves report, based on an August 1st snapshot. This detailed report gives us a clear picture of the exchange‚Äôs asset backing. It highlights significant shifts in the platform‚Äôs asset distribution, providing valuable insights into market dynamics and user activity. Bitcoin (BTC) Holdings: User BTC holdings reached 591,164, marking a healthy 2.99% increase from the previous month. This growth reflects continued user confidence and accumulation of the leading cryptocurrency. Ethereum (ETH) Holdings: ETH holdings experienced a notable decline, falling 9.84% to 4.555 million. This reduction in Ethereum decline suggests potential shifts in user preferences or broader market trends impacting the second-largest cryptocurrency. Tether (USDT) Holdings: USDT holdings saw a modest rise of 0.87%, reaching 29.855 billion. The stability of USDT holdings is crucial, as it indicates consistent demand for the widely used stablecoin for trading and hedging. These figures, initially reported by Wu Blockchain on X, provide a transparent view of Binance‚Äôs commitments to its users. Why Do Binance Holdings Matter for Users? Understanding Binance holdings is crucial for any cryptocurrency user. Proof of Reserves reports are more than just numbers; they are a vital tool for ensuring accountability and solvency in the crypto industry. They demonstrate that an exchange holds sufficient assets to cover user deposits, preventing situations like those seen with less transparent platforms in the past. For users, this transparency builds confidence. It allows them to verify that their funds are genuinely backed by the exchange‚Äôs reserves, reducing systemic risk and promoting a healthier, more secure trading environment. Moreover, tracking these reports helps users assess the overall health and stability of the platform they choose for their crypto activities. Decoding the Shifts: Bitcoin Gains and Ethereum‚Äôs Dip The latest report reveals interesting trends. The increase in Bitcoin holdings could stem from several factors. It might indicate a flight to quality during uncertain market times, as Bitcoin is often seen as a safe haven asset. Alternatively, it could be a result of increased user deposits into BTC, reflecting growing bullish sentiment or long-term investment strategies. Conversely, the Ethereum decline warrants attention. This decrease could be due to users withdrawing ETH for staking on the Beacon Chain, participating in DeFi protocols off-exchange, or simply diversifying into other assets. Market corrections or shifts in investor interest towards other Layer 1 blockchains might also play a role in this observed trend. It‚Äôs important to view these movements within the context of the broader cryptocurrency market. The Future of Crypto Reserves and Industry Transparency Binance‚Äôs consistent publication of its crypto reserves reports sets a high standard for the industry. This commitment to transparency is fundamental for fostering trust, especially in a sector that has faced scrutiny regarding its operational integrity. As the cryptocurrency market matures, such regular audits and disclosures will become increasingly important for regulatory acceptance and mainstream adoption. The ongoing commitment to Proof of Reserves helps to mitigate risks and ensures that exchanges remain accountable to their users. It promotes a healthier ecosystem where users can make informed decisions based on verifiable data, not just promises. This level of transparency is key to building a robust and resilient digital asset future. In summary, Binance‚Äôs August Proof of Reserves report paints a clear picture: a robust increase in Bitcoin and USDT holdings underscores strong user confidence and stablecoin demand, while the observed Ethereum decline prompts a deeper look into evolving market dynamics. These reports are invaluable for maintaining trust and transparency in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Binance Proof of Reserves?

El-Erian argued that the Fed would have cut interest rates if it had known about the July employment revisions in advance. El-Erian stated, ‚ÄúIf the Fed had seen the July employment revisions before the meeting, it would have definitely cut interest rates,‚Äù adding that current market conditions reflect the weakening economy. He emphasized that recent data indicates a significant decline in spending by low-income households, which he said is also reflected in corporate balance sheets. He noted that interest rate cut expectations in the US bond market have reached 90%, making it almost certain that the Fed will cut rates by at least 25 basis points in September. El-Erian said a 25 basis point cut in September was a certainty, but a larger 50 basis point cut was a possibility. Recalling that the Fed has made similar surprise moves in the past, he said, ‚ÄúLast year, they did nothing in July, and then in September, they made a jumbo 50 basis point cut.‚Äù Related News: Bitcoin Bull Economist Compares Solana and Ethereum: Reveals Which One Is Better El-Erian criticized President Trump's dismissal of the BLS head, arguing that the move undermined the institutional integrity of US economic data production. ‚ÄúSuch dismissals undermine trust in the impartiality of statistical institutions,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis poses a serious problem for market confidence.‚Äù El-Erian reiterated that Fed Chair Jerome Powell should resign before his term expires. ‚ÄúPowell is leaving in May anyway,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHowever, as long as he remains in office, political pressure will increase, and this could undermine the Fed's independence,‚Äù he said, adding that this step would be the best choice to preserve the institutional structure. Trump's comments that he is considering Kevin Hassett and Kevin Warsh as the new Fed Chair, while Treasury Secretary Scott Besson's statement that he does not want the position, also came up on the program. El-Erian said that Chris Warsh and Kevin Warsh would be positive choices for the Fed's independence. *This is not investment advice.

Here Are the Details‚Ä¶,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/unexpected-development-in-binance-founder-czs-memecoin-altcoin-price-takes-a-sudden-dump-here-are-the-details/,"An unexpected development occurred in the altcoin called TST, which was launched in the first months of 2025 and caused havoc. The Test (TST) token, which Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) promoted and said was for testing purposes only and is also listed on Binance, experienced a sharp drop on Binance this morning. TST price dropped from $0.045 to $0.0159 in about 15 minutes. This represents a drop of over 60%. Having seen a small recovery after the sharp decline, TST continues to trade at $0.026 at the time of writing. TST and CZ Explanations! The TST token brought criticism with its launch. The listing of TST on Binance in a short time and the claims that it was CZ's own token increased speculation in the market. Speaking about speculations that he was involved in the token's launch, CZ maintained that TST was never sponsored by him or Binance. While CZ said TST was initially created for a video tutorial and has no official support, his attempts to clarify the situation have further fueled interest in the token. Sudden Drops Have Happened Before! On Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, some altcoins, especially ACT, experienced sudden and sharp declines exceeding 50%. At this point, altcoins such as ACT, TST, MASK, LEVER, TUT, DF, and AIXBT have experienced sharp declines in the previous months. Related News: Strange Situations Are Happening in Altcoins!

While PEPE grabs headlines with excitement, MUTM is steadily building the future of decentralized finance. A balanced opportunity against wild volatility Unlike PEPE‚Äôs hype-driven surges, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be built around a functional architecture that targets stability and growth. The platform will operate a dual lending system, starting with Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending. Here, users will deposit dependable assets such as USDC, AVAX, and LINK into shared liquidity pools. These deposits will generate stable APYs ranging between 9% and 12% (depending on the pool utilization), making the opportunity appealing for those seeking consistent yield. Depositors will receive mtTokens on a 1:1 basis, which not only will accrue interest automatically but also will unlock staking rewards paid out in MUTM tokens if staked in the smart contracts. This model will ensure that users benefit directly from their participation in the protocol‚Äôs liquidity, creating a steady income stream in addition to capital appreciation. The second lending layer will be Peer-to-Peer (P2P), which will be crafted for high-risk, high-reward players. This part of the platform will allow loans to be issued and collateralized with speculative tokens such as PEPE, DOGE, FLOKI, BONK, and TRUMP. These contracts will be directly negotiated between lenders and borrowers, providing flexibility in terms and interest rates. Crucially, the risks and rewards of P2P lending will remain isolated from the more stable P2C pools, ensuring the core platform stays secure and resilient against volatility in speculative assets. This layered approach to lending will position Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a comprehensive DeFi ecosystem catering to both conservative and aggressive investors. Currently, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in its Phase 6 presale, with the price set at $0.035. To date, the project has raised $14.1 million, gathered nearly 14,800 holders, and sold 10% of the token supply. This is the last discounted phase, and once it concludes, the price will rise to $0.040‚Äîa 15% increase that marks the final opportunity to buy in at an early price point. Early participation means locking in a discounted entry before the wider market access opens, which positions investors to capitalize on upcoming momentum. Why experts and early investors are excited Analysts who have a strong track record, including accurate forecasts for Polkadot (DOT)‚Äôs breakout and early Solana (SOL) growth, are now projecting Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to reach $1.05 by mid-2026. This forecast is based on the project‚Äôs unique dual lending mechanics, anticipated Layer-2 integration for faster transactions, and a full launch of its beta platform. One confident investor swapped $4,000 from AVAX into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) during Phase 1 and is now sitting on a $14,000 unrealized stake‚Äîa 250% gain before the token even hits major exchanges. This same stake is expected to surpass $60,000 once the beta launches and key exchange listings materialize, showcasing a substantial return driven by increasing staking demand and token buybacks. The platform‚Äôs roadmap, divided into four distinct phases, will guide Mutuum Finance (MUTM) from presale through development, audit completion, and ultimately to multichain Layer-2 launch. The upcoming beta release will allow users to experience the protocol firsthand, bringing real-world utility to the project and fueling further token demand. Security and transparency have been top priorities, reflected by Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs high CertiK audit score of 95 and a solid Skynet rating of 78. The project also runs a bug bounty program to encourage the community to report vulnerabilities, reinforcing its commitment to safety. Additionally, the project is energizing its community with a $100,000 giveaway, distributing MUTM tokens to ten lucky winners, which helps build a loyal and engaged supporter base. Final words While PEPE dazzles with flashy social-driven pumps, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is methodically building a sustainable ecosystem with real lending use cases and long-term value drivers. The $0.035 price point in this presale phase is fleeting‚Äîonce the token moves to $0.040, the easy entry window closes. For those who want to combine growth with security, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a clear, calculated path that blends stable yields, high-risk options, and a well-structured development plan. As August unfolds, investors looking beyond mere hype are turning to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the smarter, more balanced choice under $0.05. Time is running out to join this presale phase, and the rewards for early entry promise to be significant as the project advances toward its full potential.

In its first-half earnings call on Tuesday, KakaoBank CFO Kwon Tae-hoon said the firm is ‚Äúactively considering‚Äù roles in both stablecoin issuance and custody, with participation aligned to the country‚Äôs shifting digital asset policies. ‚ÄúWe plan to engage actively in line with market changes,‚Äù Kwon said, adding that KakaoBank‚Äôs internal task force is working with other Kakao units to consolidate strategy. Join the crypto policy conversation Sept. 10 in D.C. ‚Äî Register now for CoinDesk: Policy & Regulation . The move adds a regulated online bank to the list of Korean fintechs jumping into the stablecoin race after the Bank of Korea (BOK) shelved its central bank digital currency (CBDC) pilot in June. The project, as CoinDesk previously reported had reached the testing phase with commercial banks and abruptly halted after President Lee Jae-myung‚Äôs administration submitted legislation enabling the local issuance of stablecoins. Kwon emphasized KakaoBank‚Äôs technical readiness, noting the firm had participated in both phases of the now-cancelled BOK pilot. ‚ÄúWe built and operated wallets and handled exchanges and transfers,‚Äù he said, pointing to operational experience most firms in the sector can‚Äôt yet claim. He also cited three years of compliance work issuing real-name accounts for crypto exchanges, giving the bank a head start in implementing the kind of KYC and AML frameworks regulators are likely to demand for fiat-pegged tokens. KakaoBank is part of a weekly stablecoin-focused task force within the Kakao ecosystem, working alongside KakaoPay and the parent group. CEOs Chung Shin-ah (Kakao), Shin Won-keun (KakaoPay), and Yoon Ho-young (KakaoBank) are leading the initiative. The stablecoin pivot has ignited a wave of speculation and retail activity in Korea‚Äôs markets. Circle stock, which went public in June, became the most-purchased foreign equity among Korean retail investors.

Analysts predict it could hit $2 post-launch, offering a 20x return compared to PEPE‚Äôs projected gains. Consequently, investors are eyeing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for its robust utility and scalability. Pepe Coin‚Äôs limited upside Pepe Coin (PEPE) is surfing on the optimism cycle within the meme coin segment. Its fee is at 0.000011, and momentum indicators such as RSI and MACD are pointing to fresh buying pressure. If PEPE breaks the $0.000014 resistance, a 5x increase to $0.000055 in 2025 is feasible. Moreover, positive funding rates and long traders dominating shorts bolster short-term confidence. However, PEPE‚Äôs lack of a utility-driven roadmap raises concerns. Without a clear development plan, its long-term potential remains uncertain. Thus, while PEPE may offer quick gains, its speculative nature limits its appeal compared to projects with stronger fundamentals. Mutuum Finance‚Äôs presale momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 6 of its 11-phase presale, with tokens priced at $0.035, a 250% increase from the $0.01 starting price. Over $14,100,000 has been raised, with 665 million tokens sold to 14,900 holders. Phase 6 is selling out fast, and the window to secure tokens at this price is closing rapidly. Furthermore, Phase 7 will bring a 14.3% price hike to $0.04, with the launch price set at $0.06, guaranteeing a 71% ROI for current buyers. Investors purchasing now could see a 57x return if Mutuum Finance (MUTM) reaches its projected $2 post-launch in 2025. Innovative lending ecosystem Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a decentralized lending platform that blends peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-contract (P2C) models. This two-fold system enables the user to earn specifically at stablecoins such as USDC or layer ones such as ETH at a stable 12% APY, or instead P2P lending with memecoins such as DOGE at up to 33% APY. Additionally, its overcollateralized stablecoin system ensures stability by minting tokens only during loans and burning them upon repayment. Operating on a Layer-2 network, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) slashes gas fees by up to 90%, boosting accessibility. Consequently, this scalability drives token demand, supporting long-term price growth. Security and community engagement Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has finalized a CertiK audit, earning a 95.00 security score with no vulnerabilities in its smart contracts. The team has also launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program with CertiK, rewarding discoveries across critical, major, minor, and low severity tiers. Furthermore, a $100,000 MUTM giveaway is underway, splitting $10,000 among 10 winners who invest $50 in the presale and complete simple tasks. The team has introduced a leaderboard rewarding the top 50 holders with bonus tokens, fostering loyalty. These initiatives underscore Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs commitment to trust and community, enhancing its appeal in the crypto investment space. Why Mutuum Finance outshines Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just another altcoin; it‚Äôs a high-utility DeFi project with a 4 billion token cap and a clear roadmap. Its Layer-2 integration, dual lending model, and stablecoin system position it for mass adoption. While Pepe Coin (PEPE) may deliver a 5x return, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs projected 20x surge to $2 in 2025 offers unmatched potential.

He also believes South Korea will face the most favourable U.S. tariff rates on chips. U.S. President Donald Trump warned on Wednesday that countries that do not produce semiconductors in the U.S., or are planning to do so, will face 100% tariffs on semiconductor exports to the U.S. He also exempted countries that had made a commitment to manufacture chips in the U.S. or were in the process of doing so.

Yeo Han-koo also said he hoped there would be a trade deal between Washington and Seoul on semiconductors, but he did not elaborate further. South Korea‚Äôs Samsung owns two chip fabrication sites in Texas, one in Austin and another in Taylor. The firm‚Äôs new site is part of a larger expansion to boost domestic chip manufacturing. The Center for American Progress revealed that the project is under the CHIPS and Science Act, which provides incentives for domestic chip manufacturing. The U.S. Commerce Department granted SK Hynix $458M last year to support the construction of a chip packaging plant in West Lafayette, Indiana. The South Korean firm also announced that it plans to invest $3.87 billion in the project, and the government will provide $500 million in loans as part of the deal. ‚ÄúWhile both Samsung and SK Hynix have made U.S. investments, there are doubts about whether SK Hynix‚Äôs packaging plant alone would fully qualify for tariff exemptions.‚Äù ‚Äì Baik Gil-hyun, Analyst at Yuanta Securities. At the time of publication, Samsung Electronics‚Äô share price saw a 1.74% surge in the last 24 hours, to 70,050 Korean won. SK Hynix‚Äôs stock price also saw a mere 0.3% rise in the last 24 hours to 259,250 KRW. Trump announced last week that the U.S. had agreed to a trade deal with the Republic of Korea. He imposed a 15% levy on imports from the Asian trading partner.

The iPhone maker revealed on Wednesday that the South Korean company will supply chips from its production plant in Texas for Apple products. Apple said on Thursday that it‚Äôs working with Samsung at its fab in Austin to launch an innovative new technology for manufacturing chips. The company said the initiative will allow the facility to supply chips that optimize the power and performance of Apple products, including iPhones. Kiwoom Securities analyst Park Yu-ak argued that the chips in question are likely image sensors for next-generation iPhones. He believes the initiative of producing image sensors for the iPhone 18 next year would boost sales in Samsung‚Äôs semiconductor division. Sony has been Apple‚Äôs source for image sensors for iPhones. It accounted for over 50% of the global image sensor market as of last year, while Samsung accounted for 15.4%. The iPhone maker also revealed that it would spend an additional $100 billion in U.S. investments, reaching $600 billion in investments in the U.S. over the next four years.

XRP and ETH Analysts Make Bold Calls,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-to-250k-in-q4-xrp-and-eth-analysts-make-bold-calls/,"Bitcoin bulls are back with a vengeance. After topping $123,000 earlier this year and breaking into a steady climb above $140,000, some top analysts are now forecasting a potential move toward $250,000 by Q4 2025. The driver? A potent mix of institutional capital, ETF momentum, and dwindling sell pressure from long-term holders. According to data from leading on-chain platforms, whale accumulation continues at a record pace, while major ETF inflows‚Äîespecially from BlackRock and Trump Media‚Äôs Crypto Blue Chip ETF‚Äîare fueling new capital rotation into digital assets. This bullish setup is also lifting altcoins, with analysts now predicting sharp upside for both XRP and Ethereum. And in the background, presale assets like MAGACOIN FINANCE are gaining traction as retail and early-stage buyers look for the next asymmetric bet. XRP Sets Sights on $4.50 With New Legal Milestone XRP continues to ride waves of momentum, recently breaking past the $3.14 resistance and holding above key support at $3.03. Legal experts say Ripple is closing in on a final resolution with the SEC, which could open the door to XRP ETF approvals and expanded U.S. utility. Ripple‚Äôs recent application to launch the Ripple National Trust Bank ‚Äîa federally regulated institution focused on custody and stablecoin operations‚Äîhas only added to the bullish narrative. As traders digest this shift from courtroom drama to banking-grade infrastructure, the chart tells its own story. Analysts now see targets at $3.69, $4.50, and even $5.10 if breakout momentum holds into September. Ethereum‚Äôs Bullish Run Eyes $4,234 and Beyond Ethereum is surging, up over 40% in the past month and holding strong near $3,700. Analysts cite consistent inflows into ETH-focused ETFs, expanding tokenization products, and increasing L2 usage as key catalysts behind the rally. Current resistance lies at $3,881 and $4,234, but sentiment remains bullish into Q4. With Ethereum expected to play a leading role in future tokenized banking systems, it remains a cornerstone asset for both retail and institutional portfolios. While price action may see temporary retracements, the long-term trajectory appears to be tracking higher‚Äîespecially if Bitcoin reaches that $250K milestone. Momentum Builds Around Viral Altcoin as Analysts Eye 40x Returns As Bitcoin leads the way and top altcoins follow, early-stage traders are turning to breakout projects that mirror previous cycles. One such name attracting major attention is MAGACOIN FINANCE. Bitcoin to $250K? MAGACOIN FINANCE Analysts Predict Bigger Upside with 40x Presale Surge , citing early whale activity, aggressive participation, and viral growth mechanics similar to early DOGE and SHIBA. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is the timing‚Äîit‚Äôs capitalizing on ETF-driven market optimism while still offering presale access, making it a high-conviction target for investors looking beyond the top 10. This convergence of trust signals and strategic whale action is making MAGACOIN FINANCE one of the most talked-about altcoins in the past month. Investors who missed XRP‚Äôs rise are watching closely ‚Äì and some are already positioning accordingly. Conclusion: Bull Market Energy Is Returning With Bitcoin setting the pace toward $250K and altcoins like XRP and Ethereum showing strong bullish patterns, Q4 could mark the start of the most explosive phase of the 2025 cycle. But it‚Äôs not just the top coins gaining traction‚ÄîMAGACOIN FINANCE is proving that early-stage plays are back in focus. As capital rotates and confidence returns, those positioned early may find themselves ahead of the next big move.

Project Crypto, The ‚ÄòMost Bullish‚Äô Document On Tuesday, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan discussed the SEC Chair‚Äôs recent speech, titled ‚ÄúAmerican Leadership in the Digital Finance Revolution.‚Äù In a memo to clients, Hougan affirmed that ‚Äúthe most bullish document (‚Ä¶) on crypto wasn‚Äôt written by some Yahoo on Twitter. It was written by the chairman of the SEC.‚Äù As reported by Bitcoinist, Paul Atkins outlined his vision for the financial markets over the next years in a speech to the America First Policy Institute. In the speech, the SEC Chain unveiled the ‚ÄúProject Crypto‚Äù initiative, which aims to transform the US into the ‚Äúcrypto capital of the world.‚Äù The commission-wide initiative is expected to modernize securities rules and regulations, enabling US financial markets to move on-chain and ‚Äúhelp ensure that the United States remains the best place in the world to start a business, develop cutting-edge technologies, and participate in capital markets.‚Äù Atkins‚Äôs speech is ‚Äúthe most complete vision of how crypto can reshape financial markets,‚Äù the Bitwise CIO affirmed, arguing that it seems like the SEC Chair ‚Äútook all the best ideas crypto supporters have been promoting for the past decade and packaged them in a single speech, along with details on how the SEC can actually make them happen.‚Äù Hougan suggested that the most obvious question is whether the SEC‚Äôs vision was priced in. If the markets were already anticipating the SEC shift from ‚Äúcrypto antagonist to crypto catalyst,‚Äù then it should already be factored into the price of most digital assets. Nonetheless, he argued that he realized it is time to ‚Äúthink bigger‚Äù and ‚Äúmove to a faster timeline‚Äù after reading the speech, concluding that ‚ÄúIf it wasn‚Äôt priced in for me, I‚Äôm going to guess it wasn‚Äôt priced in for others.‚Äù Opening The Door For Key Opportunities In the memo, Hougan highlighted that there‚Äôs ‚Äúa lot to unpack‚Äù from Atkins‚Äôs remarks, ‚Äúyou could build an entire venture capital firm around the chairman‚Äôs vision, creating companies to capitalize on each opportunity he lays out,‚Äù he continued. However, he asserted that three immediate investment opportunities stand out, starting with investing in Ethereum and other Layer 1 blockchains that support stablecoins and tokenization. He argued that, as US regulators and lawmakers work to modernize rules and create legal frameworks to bring the financial market on-chain, gaining exposure to the underlying platforms is crucial. The best approach is likely to buy a basket of the leading assets: Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, XRP, Avalanche, Aptos, Sui, NEAR, and so on. A second opportunity rises in what Atkins called ‚ÄúSuper-Apps,‚Äù which are platforms offering a broader range of financial services. In the speech, the SEC chair argued that broker-dealers should be able to offer crypto and traditional trading, and services like staking and lending, without ‚Äúrequiring fifty-plus state licenses or multiple federal licenses.‚Äù To Bitwise CIO, platforms like Coinbase and Robinhood have embraced the super-app concept and ‚Äúcould become the largest financial services company in the world, maybe even becoming the first financial services company worth more than $1 trillion,‚Äù with the SEC‚Äôs roadmap . Lastly, Hougan affirmed that DeFi applications are another major opportunity standing out, explaining that these apps have surged in a ‚Äúregulatory gray zone‚Äù that has constrained their growth. ‚ÄúDeFi is not just a technical revolution, but a conceptual one. And the chairman of the SEC gets it,‚Äù he highlighted, predicting that with more regulatory clarity underway, the sector could surge. Despite the lack of regulatory clarity, DeFi apps have significant usage. (‚Ä¶.) With greater clarity, could these numbers rise by 10x? 50x? 100x? As traditional and crypto markets merge, the opportunity is huge.",Crypto News|Bitwise CIO|crypto regulation|DeFi adoption|ETH|Ethereum|ETHUSDT|Matt Hougan|Paul Atkins|SEC Chairman|SEC Project Crypto|Securities and Exchange Commission|Stablecoins|US SEC,EN,0,0,REGULATION|ZRX|MARKET|ETH|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-07 06:00:22

This indicates a remarkably balanced, yet slightly bearish, sentiment among traders overall. It suggests that bulls and bears are nearly equally matched, with a marginal lean towards short positions. However, the picture becomes more nuanced when we look at individual exchange data: Binance: Long 50.35%, Short 49.65% Bybit: Long 49.17%, Short 50.83% Gate.io: Long 49.06%, Short 50.94% These figures highlight interesting divergences. Binance, a dominant player, shows a slight majority of long positions, suggesting its user base is marginally more optimistic about Bitcoin‚Äôs immediate future. In contrast, Bybit and Gate.io exhibit a clearer leaning towards short positions, indicating a more bearish outlook from their respective trader communities. Understanding these differences can provide deeper crypto trading insights . Interpreting Bitcoin Market Sentiment from These Ratios The collective Bitcoin market sentiment , as reflected by these long-short ratios , appears to be at a critical juncture. The near 50/50 split across the total market suggests indecision or a standoff between bullish and bearish forces. A slight majority of short positions could imply caution or anticipation of a minor pullback, especially after recent price movements. For instance, Binance‚Äôs slight long bias might indicate that a significant portion of its traders are either buying dips or expecting a continuation of an upward trend. On the other hand, the more pronounced short bias on Bybit and Gate.io could suggest that traders on these platforms are actively hedging against potential downside or are positioning for a corrective move. This diverse positioning across exchanges underscores the complexity of predicting market moves based on a single metric. Actionable Crypto Trading Insights: How Can You You Use This Data? While futures trading data like long-short ratios provides valuable context, it should never be your sole decision-making tool. Instead, consider it as one piece of a larger puzzle for informed trading. Here are some actionable crypto trading insights : Gauge Overbought/Oversold Conditions: Extremely skewed ratios (e.g., 70%+ long or short) can sometimes signal an impending reversal. A very high long ratio might suggest an overbought market ripe for a correction, and vice versa. Our current data, however, indicates a relatively balanced market. Identify Divergences: Pay attention to discrepancies between overall market ratios and those of individual exchanges. These divergences can highlight where large pockets of sentiment are forming, potentially influencing price action. Confirm Other Indicators: Use long-short ratios to confirm or challenge signals from other technical analysis indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD, support/resistance levels). If your technical analysis suggests a bullish move and the long-short ratio is also leaning long, it strengthens your conviction. Risk Management: A balanced market, as seen today, often implies higher volatility or sideways movement until a clearer sentiment emerges. This knowledge can help you adjust your risk management strategies, perhaps by reducing position sizes or tightening stop-losses. Remember, markets are fluid. These ratios can change rapidly, reflecting shifts in trader psychology and external news events. In conclusion, monitoring BTC perpetual futures long-short ratios offers an unparalleled window into prevailing Bitcoin market sentiment . While the overall market appears finely balanced with a slight bearish tilt, individual exchange data reveals interesting nuances. By integrating these long-short ratios with other analytical tools, traders can refine their strategies and make more informed decisions in the ever-evolving crypto landscape. This crucial futures trading data empowers you to navigate the market with greater confidence. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are BTC perpetual futures? A1: BTC perpetual futures are a type of derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of Bitcoin without an expiration date. Unlike traditional futures, they do not settle physically and can be held indefinitely, mimicking spot price movements. Q2: How are long-short ratios calculated? A2: Long-short ratios are typically calculated by dividing the total number or volume of long positions by the total number or volume of short positions on an exchange or across multiple exchanges. A ratio above 1 indicates more long positions, while below 1 indicates more short positions. Our data presents it as a percentage split. Q3: Do long-short ratios predict price movements? A3: While long-short ratios provide valuable insights into Bitcoin market sentiment and trader positioning, they are not direct predictors of price movements. They are best used as a confluence indicator, helping to confirm or challenge signals from other technical and fundamental analyses. Extreme ratios can sometimes precede reversals. Q4: Which exchanges provide long-short ratio data? A4: Many major cryptocurrency exchanges that offer perpetual futures trading, such as Binance, Bybit, Gate.io, OKX, and others, provide their own long-short ratio data, often accessible through their analytics pages or APIs. Aggregators also compile this data from various sources. Q5: What does a 50/50 long-short ratio mean? A5: A 50/50 (or near 50/50) long-short ratio suggests a very balanced market sentiment, where bullish and bearish traders are almost equally positioned. This can indicate indecision, consolidation, or a period of potential sideways movement before a clearer trend emerges. It highlights a strong contest between buyers and sellers.

49677206,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=407523,1754547130,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/49677206.jpeg,Shiba Inu to Appoint Interim President ‚Äì Here‚Äôs Why That Matters,https://cryptopotato.com/shiba-inu-to-appoint-interim-president-heres-why-that-matters/,"TL;DR Shiba Inu is introducing its first-ever democratic process to appoint an interim president through a multi-phase election involving open nominations, debates, and final voting. Lead developer Shytoshi Kusama announced a shift toward community-led governance, encouraging SHIB whales to run for the position. The Elections Earlier this month, the popular meme coin project Shiba Inu celebrated its fifth birthday. Over the past half a decade, it underwent numerous developments, while Shytoshi Kusama unveiled the next one: the election of an interim president. The lead developer said the appointment of such a figure will happen after ‚Äúfair elections,‚Äù whereas the voting will go through three sessions. ‚ÄúThe first allows for anyone to be nominated, while the top 10 move onto the debate phase. Debates will take place LIVE or recorded on various platforms and times, while a secondary vote to find the top 3 will take place after one week,‚Äù the announcement reads. It is important to mention that anyone can nominate themselves for the position and will be required to create a profile to give the community some info about who they are. The final vote will take place one week after the debates between the three remaining candidates. The appointed president will be responsible for the well-being and future vision of the project and the proper execution of the Shib Paper guidelines. ‚ÄúThey are to implement the first congress (consisting of the four DAO councils), which stands as the inter-branch DAO mentioned in the Shib Paper. Most importantly, they are responsible for the community of millions and the financial responsibility of a 7 billion dollar token,‚Äù Kusama added. According to the developer, the perfect candidate must combine ‚Äútechnological prowess, unwavering dedication, and impeccable vision.‚Äù Last but not least, Kusama recommended that the president be a whale in the SHIB community (an investor who has substantial holdings of the meme coin). ‚ÄúFor this reason, I suggest a multi-vote system for this election where 1 token = 1 vote for any and all of the ecosystem tokens. In this way, whales should hypothetically win, which is aligned as they have the most skin in our success. Moreover, I implore the community to rigorously vet, check, and learn about all candidates,‚Äù they advised. What About Kusama? The lead developer argued that they have been deemed responsible for completing Ryoshi‚Äôs vision. To the uninitiated, Ryoshi is the pseudonymous creator of Shiba Inu who hasn‚Äôt revealed their identity. Kusama said their role now rests with the community, but said they will continue to post details on the election date and other updates. ‚ÄúWe will continue working on innovation, and closely with the Treat Dao and strategies therein, and will continue pursuits outside of SHIB that align with our vision and often contribute to the ecosystem or DAOs. In this way, we continue as valued Shibizens of a system we helped build from nothing,‚Äù the developer concluded.

In a significant development, Bithumb has officially designated Self Chain (SLF) as a closely monitored asset . This move, signaling increased scrutiny, has prompted immediate attention across the market, especially for those holding or trading SLF. Understanding the implications of this Bithumb SLF monitoring is crucial for all investors. What‚Äôs Happening with Self Chain Crypto? Bithumb, a prominent South Korean crypto exchange Bithumb , made its announcement regarding Self Chain Crypto (SLF) on its official website. The core of this designation is a comprehensive review process. Essentially, SLF is now under heightened observation due to specific concerns identified by the exchange. This decision is not arbitrary. Bithumb‚Äôs assessment considered several critical factors: Issuer‚Äôs Social Credibility: A review of the reputation and trustworthiness of the Self Chain project team. Smart Contract Code Disclosure: Examination of how transparently the smart contract code is disclosed on the distributed ledger. Control Over Major Event Functions: Evaluation of the project‚Äôs control mechanisms concerning significant events impacting the asset. These factors collectively indicate areas where Self Chain may need to improve or provide further clarity to maintain its standing on the exchange. Understanding a Closely Monitored Asset Status When a digital asset like SLF is labeled a closely monitored asset , it signals that the exchange has identified potential risks or areas of concern. It‚Äôs a precautionary measure, not an immediate delisting. However, it serves as a strong warning to both the project team and investors. For users, this status often leads to restricted activities. In this specific case, Bithumb has explicitly stated that SLF deposit suspension will commence. This means users will no longer be able to deposit SLF tokens into their Bithumb accounts starting from August 7 at 06:00 UTC. Such designations are common practice among exchanges globally. They aim to protect users and maintain market integrity. Moreover, they encourage projects to address identified issues promptly. How Does Crypto Exchange Bithumb Decide? The decision by crypto exchange Bithumb to place Self Chain under monitoring stems from a rigorous internal review. This review evaluates various aspects of a project‚Äôs health and compliance. The goal is to ensure a secure and trustworthy trading environment for its users. This thorough evaluation process, part of the broader Bithumb SLF monitoring initiative, underscores the exchange‚Äôs commitment to due diligence. It helps to mitigate risks associated with projects that might lack transparency or robust operational controls. Such proactive measures are vital in the fast-evolving crypto landscape, protecting investors from potential pitfalls. The Impact of SLF Deposit Suspension and What‚Äôs Next The immediate and most direct impact of this designation is the SLF deposit suspension . Starting August 7 at 06:00 UTC, users will be unable to transfer Self Chain (SLF) tokens into their Bithumb accounts. While withdrawals and trading might continue for a period, the suspension of deposits is often a precursor to further action if issues are not resolved. The designation as a closely monitored asset places the onus on the Self Chain Crypto project team to address Bithumb‚Äôs concerns. This typically involves improving transparency, enhancing communication, and potentially making technical adjustments to their smart contracts or operational procedures. The future status of Self Chain on Bithumb will depend on the project‚Äôs ability to satisfy the exchange‚Äôs requirements. If the issues remain unaddressed, further restrictions or even delisting could occur. Conversely, successful resolution could lead to the removal of the monitoring status. Investors should exercise caution and conduct their own due diligence. This latest development from crypto exchange Bithumb regarding Bithumb SLF monitoring serves as a reminder of the dynamic and regulated nature of the cryptocurrency market. Exchanges actively work to safeguard their users and maintain a healthy trading environment. For Self Chain, this is a critical juncture that demands a proactive response to ensure its continued presence on one of South Korea‚Äôs leading platforms. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does ‚Äúclosely monitored asset‚Äù mean for Self Chain (SLF)? A1: It means Bithumb has identified potential risks or concerns with Self Chain (SLF) and is subjecting it to heightened scrutiny. It‚Äôs a warning sign, not an immediate delisting, but indicates the need for the project to address identified issues. Q2: Why did Bithumb designate SLF as a closely monitored asset? A2: Bithumb‚Äôs decision was based on a comprehensive review of factors including the issuer‚Äôs social credibility, the disclosure status of smart contract code, and control over functions related to major events. Q3: When will SLF deposit suspension take effect on Bithumb? A3: SLF deposits will be suspended starting on August 7 at 06:00 UTC. Q4: Can I still trade or withdraw Self Chain (SLF) on Bithumb?
