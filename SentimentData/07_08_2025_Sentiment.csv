Internet Computer protocol price forecast for 2028 expects the token to reach a peak price of $36.8. By 2031, the price of Internet Computer might reach a maximum of $113.32. Internet Computer (ICP) is a groundbreaking blockchain network developed by the DFINITY Foundation. It aims to extend the functionality of the internet, enabling it to host backend software and transforming it into a global, decentralized computer. Internet computer blockchain incorporates advanced cryptography and innovative technology to provide scalable, efficient, and secure decentralized applications (dApps). Given its robust technology and expanding utility, the Internet Computer blockchain‚Äôs future price prospects look promising. As more developers build on the platform and adoption increases, ICP token demand will likely rise. Does Internet Computer coin have a future? How much will Internet Computer coin cost in 2025? Will ICP reach $1000? Let‚Äôs get into the current price analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Internet Computer Token ICP Price $5.12 Market Cap $2.74B Trading Volume $66.21M Circulating Supply 536.26M ICP All-time High $750.73 (May 10, 2021) All-time Low $2.86 (Sep 2023) 24-h High $5.16 24-h Low $4.96 Internet Computer Network technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day period) 5.69% 14-Day RSI 42.80 50-Day SMA $5.29 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 54 (Neutral) Green Days 16/30 (53%) 200-Day SMA $6.09 Internet Computer price analysis TL;DR Breakdown ICP remains bearish despite 1.48% daily gains. OBV shows heavy selling pressure. A break below $5.00 could trigger a cascade toward $4.812. ICP 1-day price analysis The daily chart for August 6 shows ICP trading at $5.122 with a modest +1.48% gain, yet with concerning underlying weakness. The price action remains trapped within the Bollinger Bands, with the upper band at $6.204 acting as strong resistance and the lower band at $4.812 providing support. ICPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD indicator shows both the signal line and MACD line residing in negative territory, while the histogram shows minimal bullish divergence at -0.007, suggesting momentum remains firmly bearish despite today‚Äôs minor uptick. ICP 4-hour price analysis The 4-hour timeframe shows ICP trading below the 20-period SMA at $5.138, which immediately signals short-term bearish pressure. The On Balance Volume plunging to -41.29M exposes significant selling pressure that contradicts any surface-level price stability, while the Balance of Power reading of -0.86 confirms sellers dominate the current market structure. ICPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The recent candlestick formation shows alternating green and red bars with substantial wicks, indicating intense battles between buyers and sellers around the $5.10-$5.15 range, though the bearish OBV suggests money continues flowing out despite these consolidation patterns. ICP technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $5.03 BUY SMA 5 $5.17 SELL SMA 10 $5.34 SELL SMA 21 $5.59 SELL SMA 50 $5.29 SELL SMA 100 $5.35 SELL SMA 200 $6.09 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $5.35 SELL EMA 5 $5.32 SELL EMA 10 $5.25 SELL EMA 21 $5.28 SELL EMA 50 $5.73 SELL EMA 100 $6.69 SELL EMA 200 $7.77 SELL What to expect from ICP price analysis The current market condition points toward further downside pressure, with the immediate target being the lower Bollinger Band at $4.812. Bears maintain control through negative MACD readings and substantial OBV outflows, while bulls struggle to reclaim the 20-day SMA at $5.138. Any break below $5.00 psychological support could trigger accelerated selling toward $4.50, whereas sustained recovery above $5.20 would be needed to invalidate the bearish market. Is Internet Computer a good investment? The Internet Computer (ICP) has shown significant potential and volatility since its launch, which is common for relatively new and ambitious blockchain projects. Its technology aims to decentralize the internet and bring smart contract functionality to the web, which could have wide-ranging implications for the future of web speed. However, the market performance of ICP has been highly volatile, and its success depends heavily on the adoption of its technology and the broader market environment for cryptocurrencies. Please note that before you make an investment decision, seek independent professional consultation. Will Internet Computer reach $25? Yes, Internet Computer ICP might reach and surpass $25 as early as 2027. Will Internet Computer reach $50? Yes, Internet Computer is expected to reach $50. Though the current internet computer sentiment is sideways, future price movements and market cap are expected to be positive. Will ICP reach $1000? Although its ATH sits at $750.73, attaining $1000 in the foreseeable future might be impossible.

49661491,549593,1754521214,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49661491.jpeg,"Ripple Flamed By Caitlin Long: ‚ÄòXRP Is Doomed, Banks Don‚Äôt Trust It‚Äô",https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-flamed-by-caitlin-long-xrp-doomed/,"Caitlin Long, founder and CEO of Custodia Bank, delivered one of the harshest assessments yet of Ripple and the XRP ecosystem in a recent episode of the Gold Goats ‚Äòn Guns podcast, calling into question the project‚Äôs credibility, tokenomics, and long-term viability in institutional finance. In a sweeping critique, Long stated bluntly: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not going to take over. If it were going to take over, it would have taken over a long time ago.‚Äù Caitlin Long Slams Ripple And XRP The conversation began with a reference to growing speculation that Ripple might be among the blockchain networks ‚Äúblessed‚Äù by regulators to handle tokenized financial infrastructure. But Long pushed back hard on that narrative, saying the idea ‚Äúoverstates how important that network is.‚Äù According to Long, the core issue lies in Ripple‚Äôs structural legacy. ‚ÄúThe banks have always been suspicious of it,‚Äù she said, citing what she described as the project‚Äôs centralized architecture and flawed tokenomics. ‚ÄúIt is a centralized network and the tokenomics are backwards.‚Äù She argued that the XRP supply model ‚Äî rooted in a massive pre-mine and upfront fundraising ‚Äî has permanently damaged institutional trust. ‚ÄúThe people who extracted money up front are never going to be trusted because everybody is going to look and think that anything they do is an exit scam to try to dump on retail.‚Äù For Long, the contrast with Bitcoin and Ethereum is stark. ‚ÄúThe most effective tokenization platforms are the ones where there was no money up front or very little money up front,‚Äù she explained. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs Bitcoin and Ethereum.‚Äù Long also interpreted Ripple‚Äôs recent pivot ‚Äî with the company now launching its own regulated stablecoin ‚Äî as a tacit admission of failure. ‚ÄúInstead of trying to sell that into the banking industry, they‚Äôre getting their own regulated financial institutions and trying to issue a stablecoin,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs kind of, in some ways, an admission that the base layer blockchain didn‚Äôt get the adoption they were looking for.‚Äù Her comments come amid Ripple‚Äôs continued push into institutional markets, including efforts to obtain a US bank charter and launch a US dollar stablecoin. While these moves have been celebrated in some circles as signs of maturity and strategic adaptation, Long framed them as a fallback, noting that the original promise ‚Äî to become a foundational layer for interbank settlement ‚Äî had clearly not materialized. ‚ÄúThe base layer network is not going to become the base layer of replacing SWIFT,‚Äù she said. She also pointed to the legal and regulatory drag Ripple faced over the past several years, including the SEC‚Äôs long-running lawsuit against the company for allegedly conducting an unregistered securities offering. ‚ÄúThat hamstrung them,‚Äù she said, while acknowledging that Ripple wasn‚Äôt alone in suffering under the Biden administration‚Äôs broader crackdown on crypto: ‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt hurt Ripple as much as the Fed hurt us‚Ä¶ Everybody who was targeted by the Biden administration was hurt to varying degrees.‚Äù When asked what network the US Treasury is most likely to choose for tokenizing US Treasuries, Long was unequivocal: ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not going to use Ripple. They‚Äôre going to use Ethereum. They may use Bitcoin, but the Bitcoin layer twos are not mature enough for something like that.‚Äù She cited Ethereum‚Äôs technical maturity and infrastructure readiness as the decisive factors. XRP Community Reacts The backlash from the XRP community was swift and furious. Prominent community figure Crypto Eri called the remarks ‚Äúugly tribalism,‚Äù accusing Long of conflating Ripple with the XRP Ledger, and failing to distinguish between a centralized company and a decentralized protocol. ‚ÄúThe entire blockchain community should be deeply disappointed,‚Äù she wrote. Digital Asset Investor, another well-known XRP supporter, tagged Ripple executives directly, suggesting the company was still on track to achieve regulatory breakthroughs. Ashley Prosper went even further, alleging that Long‚Äôs criticism may stem from frustration over Custodia Bank‚Äôs lack of a Federal Reserve master account : ‚ÄúSounds like Caitlin Long is mad that Ripple will get their Fed master account before Custodia Bank.‚Äù But Long‚Äôs criticism was not offhanded nor casual ‚Äî it was pointed and rooted in her long-standing perspective on what makes blockchain infrastructure bank-grade. For her, trust, decentralization, and long-term neutrality are prerequisites ‚Äî and XRP, in her view, fails on all three. ‚ÄúRipple‚Äôs been at this longer than almost anybody else and they haven‚Äôt made a lot of progress,‚Äù Long concluded. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really that simple.‚Äù At press time, XRP traded at $2.94.",XRP|Caitlin Long|ripple|ripple news|XRP news|XRP price,EN,0,0,XRP|FIAT|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-06 23:00:14

Yet sometimes, a project does more than follow market flow; it reshapes it. When talking about the best crypto coins to buy now, it‚Äôs about more than price jumps. It‚Äôs about ongoing development, functional use cases, and a shift in user experience. Here are four crypto coins standing out today, each driving change in unique ways. Leading the charge is BlockDAG, offering a presale experience unlike any other. BlockDAG: Real-Time Trading Dashboard During Presale Rather than just showing high returns, BlockDAG (BDAG) is reworking the entire presale model. Typical presales offer limited access and basic visuals. BlockDAG changes that with an interactive simulator featuring live BDAG/USD charts, a real-time order book, and functioning BUY/SELL tools. This isn‚Äôt a placeholder; it‚Äôs a real trading experience, available even before exchange listings. A standout feature is the wallet-synced interface. Once users buy BDAG, their connected wallet reflects it instantly, mirroring real-time market actions. This level of interaction is almost unheard of in the presale phase and sets a high bar for other projects. BlockDAG‚Äôs performance also speaks volumes. With over $363 million raised and more than 24.7 billion coins sold, the presale is now in batch 29 at $0.0016. The price holds until August 11th. Early buyers have already seen 2,660% growth in their funds since batch 1, proving its strength. BlockDAG continues to shape presale strategies, making it one of the best crypto coins to buy now. Bittensor: Real AI Applications on the Blockchain Bittensor earns its place by blending AI and decentralization with actual function. Unlike projects built on hype, Bittensor runs a system where AI models operate in an open framework and earn rewards in TAO tokens. These rewards are based on processing power, not social chatter. That core design aligns price and performance more naturally than many speculative plays. Contributors provide computing output and are rewarded directly, reinforcing measurable outcomes. As demand for AI-based systems grows, Bittensor keeps proving its relevance. Its long-term appeal is tied to a strong use case. With few serious rivals in the decentralized AI space, Bittensor remains one of the best crypto coins to buy now for those who believe in utility-based growth. Ethereum: Evolving Infrastructure and Steady Strength Ethereum remains a major force in crypto, not because of short-term spikes, but due to its foundation in real-world applications. As the go-to smart contract platform, Ethereum dominates DeFi, NFTs, and the rollup-driven Layer 2 ecosystem. Recent efforts to improve scaling and reduce gas fees through rollups show the network‚Äôs forward momentum. Its growth doesn‚Äôt rest on novelty, but on a steady expansion of tools, adoption, and developer output. Interest from institutions remains consistent. With staking, ETFs, and multiple ecosystem updates, Ethereum holds its place as one of the best crypto coins to buy now, showing how a well-established network can continue setting new standards for others. XRP: Strong Base Backed by Legal Clarity and Utility XRP continues to gain strength due to clearer regulatory standing and increasing real-world use. After positive developments in its legal matters, XRP‚Äôs value is now more tied to activity than speculation. Ripple‚Äôs efforts in Asia and the Middle East highlight XRP‚Äôs real use in cross-border payments. Large banks testing the system for transactions show there is consistent demand grounded in actual utility. Though news events still move the price, XRP‚Äôs current position is more solid than in past cycles. For those watching utility-led growth, XRP stands out as one of the best crypto coins to buy now. Final Thoughts! Focusing only on price charts won‚Äôt give the full story when deciding the best crypto coins to buy now . What matters is which projects are reshaping how people engage with digital assets. BlockDAG stands out by offering a pre-listening trading experience that other presales don‚Äôt provide. Bittensor shows real progress in decentralized AI. Ethereum continues to strengthen its base, while XRP pushes ahead with clarity and purpose. Together, these projects show that true performance is more than just price; it‚Äôs how they redefine expectations and deliver value.

No influencer push. No meme-fueled chaos. Just a smart idea, clean tokenomics, and the kind of product that doesn‚Äôt need overexplaining. And it‚Äôs catching on fast. While many presales drown in buzzwords or recycled hype, DeSoc is building something that speaks to a wider audience of creators, users, and investors who are tired of platforms taking everything while offering almost nothing in return. DeSoc isn‚Äôt trying to replace social media. It‚Äôs trying to fix the part that matters: ownership. With a working DeFi model that connects directly to major platforms like Instagram, TikTok, X, and Facebook, the project is gaining momentum for reasons that go beyond price speculation. It‚Äôs the latest viral craze, not because it‚Äôs loud, but because it makes sense. This Isn‚Äôt Just a Crypto Presale . It‚Äôs a Product People Actually Want DeSoc is being built as a decentralized content platform that allows creators to publish once and syndicate everywhere. Through its API integrations, a user can post on DeSoc and have their content show up across their other social accounts automatically. But the real difference is what happens behind the scenes. Every post, interaction, or tip is stored immutably on-chain. That means full transparency, clear audit trails, and a creator-first model that cuts out the middlemen. In short, it‚Äôs decentralized finance applied to the internet‚Äôs social layer. It‚Äôs not about hype. It‚Äôs about giving people the tools to own what they create and to get rewarded for it directly. Tokenomics that Makes absolute Sense A lot of crypto presales throw together tokenomics as an afterthought. DeSoc took the opposite approach. Of its 3 billion $SOCS tokens, 45% are allocated to the presale. That‚Äôs not just a liquidity move, it‚Äôs a signal to early users that they‚Äôre part of something foundational. Another 20% is set aside for development. Five percent of that goes to the team, with a two-year lock-in in place. 15% goes to the marketing team, community rewards get 10%, and 10% is reserved for liquidity. There‚Äôs also a 30-year liquidity lock, one of the longest commitments we‚Äôve seen in the space. Real Monetization, Real Use Cases, Real Incentives Here‚Äôs where DeSoc really stands apart. This DeFi platform lets creators earn through tipping, content gating, subscriptions, and micropayments. Premium content? Pay to unlock it. Want to promote a post? Use your $SOCS tokens . It‚Äôs simple, direct, and designed to make engagement valuable. You can also use tokens for peer-to-peer payments, in-app purchases, and even support charitable causes or creators directly. Think of it as decentralized finance built into everyday social activity, without the jargon or the barrier to entry. The creator economy has been waiting for something like this. Now that it‚Äôs here, it‚Äôs no surprise people are piling in. Community-Driven, Governance-Ready DeSoc isn‚Äôt a token you just hold and forget. Governance is built into the platform. Token holders can submit proposals, vote on platform upgrades, and help shape reward systems and future features. Everything is executed through smart contracts, with options for quadratic voting to ensure more balanced outcomes. The idea is to move beyond passive token holding and into actual decision-making, something crypto presale buyers rarely get to be part of. It‚Äôs transparent, it‚Äôs participatory, and it gives users a voice from the start. The $10 Million Milestone? That‚Äôs just the Beginning! Plenty of projects raise big numbers. Few do it with this much clarity. DeSoc‚Äôs $10 million haul didn‚Äôt happen because of luck or noise. It happened because the pitch is clear, the product is working, and the timing is right. As more creators look to break free from platform dependency and as users demand more control over what they see and share, DeSoc lands in the perfect spot. It‚Äôs not just a platform. It‚Äôs a model for how decentralized finance can actually support real people doing real things online. And right now, it‚Äôs still early. Each presale stage offers slightly higher pricing, rewarding those who move first but keeping access open to new buyers who see the long-term vision. Conclusion DeSoc didn‚Äôt go viral by accident. It offered something that felt fresh and backed it up. It‚Äôs the kind of crypto presale that gives the space a better name. No pump-and-dump. No smoke and mirrors. Just product, people, and progress. DeSoc is quietly showing what happens when you build for value, not just volume. With more funding pouring in and features rolling out, this latest viral craze might end up being one of the smartest early-stage moves in decentralized finance right now.

Whales Are Bailing, Retail‚Äôs Late",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-bull-run-already-over-whales-bailing/,"CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn used today‚Äôs price weakness to publish a granular, 10-part ‚ÄúBitcoin Market Analysis‚Äù on X that dissects the post-ATH landscape with on-chain detail and a clear technical line in the sand. ‚ÄúBitcoin broke its all-time high, but here‚Äôs the catch: long-term holders are [starting] to sell into the strength,‚Äù he wrote, adding that what matters now is how the market digests that supply above and around the breakout zone. In his framing, the first stress test is underway. Is The Bitcoin Bull Run Over? The thread anchors around one headline-grabbing datapoint: ‚Äúthe LTH selling pressure includes the 80,000 BTC sold by the Satoshi-era wallet.‚Äù That description is Maartunn‚Äôs interpretation of July‚Äôs extraordinary movement of eight ‚Äúancient‚Äù wallets that shifted roughly 80,000 BTC after ~14 years of dormancy via Galaxy Digital. Beyond the drama of this single entity, Maartunn argues that behavior across the holder spectrum is what‚Äôs driving the tape. ‚ÄúRetail is stepping in after the ATH,‚Äù he noted, describing a familiar pattern of late-cycle enthusiasm that followed Bitcoin‚Äôs push through $120,000 in mid-July. That surge set a new record near $123,000 before momentum faded; spot prices are now revolving around $113,000‚Äì$115,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Secretly Tracking This Market Signal: Weiss Crypto The bid didn‚Äôt vanish entirely. ‚ÄúFresh capital did help the ATH-breakout buyers,‚Äù Maartunn wrote, pointing to balance-sheet demand ‚Äúfrom firms like Strategy and Metaplanet.‚Äù Those purchases are verifiable. Strategy‚Äîthe rebranded MicroStrategy‚Äîdisclosed 21,021 BTC bought between July 28 and Aug. 3 at an average of ~$117,256, lifting its holdings to ~628,791 BTC. Tokyo-listed Metaplanet added 463 BTC on Aug. 4, taking treasury holdings to 17,595 BTC. Even so, those corporate flows ‚Äúweren‚Äôt enough to hold Bitcoin around the ~$120k level,‚Äù the analyst said. Where the thread turns more cautionary is on short-term hands. ‚ÄúShort-Term Holders started to puke and sell at a loss,‚Äù Maartunn wrote, quantifying realized-loss waves of 52,230 BTC (July 15‚Äì18), 42,493 BTC (July 24‚Äì28), and 70,028 BTC ‚Äúafter July 31.‚Äù He called the last episode notable ‚Äúnot just [for] the size, but the duration,‚Äù arguing that prolonged STH loss-realization is a pressure valve that typically needs time to exhaust. These are Maartunn‚Äôs on-chain tallies; they have not been separately published by data vendors in aggregate form. The flows picture from listed products has begun to rhyme with that stress. ‚ÄúETFs are also seeing outflows,‚Äù he observed. Multiple trackers confirm a downswing: CoinShares logged the first net weekly outflow in 15 weeks (-$223 million) with Bitcoin funds leading at -$404 million, while daily tallies this week show US spot Bitcoin ETFs bleeding for several sessions, including about -$196 million on Tuesday. Framing differs by window, but the direction is clear: the bid from ETFs is wobbling at the margin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Risks Another Crash Following Recovering Into Bearish FVG Zone Technically, Maartunn fixes attention on the former breakout zone. ‚ÄúBitcoin is finding support around its previous ATH ‚Äî roughly $112K,‚Äù he wrote, pointing to a confluence between chart structure and on-chain price-distribution. His on-chain map ‚Äúbacks it up,‚Äù flagging ‚Äústrong support in the $108K‚Äì$112K range,‚Äù an area where a large volume of coins last changed hands. Context matters. Bitcoin‚Äôs July all-time high sits around $123,000 on major benchmarks‚Äîan extension of 2025‚Äôs institutional-heavy advance‚Äîso calling $112,000 a ‚Äúprevious ATH‚Äù refers to the nearer-term breakout plateau that preceded price discovery, not the absolute record. That nuance is why Maartunn concludes with a conditional: ‚ÄúSo far this cycle, we haven‚Äôt seen any previous ATH break down‚Ä¶ Until that changes, this looks like a normal pullback. But if we do break below a former ATH ($112k), that‚Äôs a real shift in market behavior.‚Äù In the near term, the credibility of that ~$108,000‚Äì$112,000 ‚Äúshelf‚Äù will likely be decided by whether supply from profit-taking long-term holders, loss-realizing short-term holders, and ETF redemptions continues to outweigh balance-sheet demand and organic spot inflows. If the shelf holds, Maartunn‚Äôs base case is ‚Äúa normal pullback‚Äù that bleeds off excesses from the ATH push. If it fails decisively, he argues, the cycle would be showing its first meaningful breach of a prior breakout‚Äîan observable change in behavior rather than a narrative turn of phrase.

49663786,550043,1754521257,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49663786.jpeg,Ethereum Under Trump: Exploring 3 Pathways For Impact From New Crypto Policies,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-under-trump-exploring-3-pathways/,"In a recent analysis by The Motley Fool, a private financial and investing advice company based in the US, the implications of President Donald Trump‚Äôs support for the cryptocurrency sector have come under scrutiny, particularly regarding Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Trump has consistently advocated for the crypto industry, surrounding himself with pro-crypto advisors and advancing initiatives such as the establishment of a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. His administration is actively promoting legislation that would establish the United States as a global leader in cryptocurrency. The recent passage of the GENIUS Act , which establishes stablecoins as the foundation of this ongoing change in the country‚Äôs digital asset ecosystem, is a key part of this effort. Trump‚Äôs Crypto Roadmap One significant aspect of Trump‚Äôs crypto policy roadmap is the effort to clarify regulatory frameworks. The lack of clear regulations has long been a concern for businesses and financial institutions operating in the crypto space. Uncertainty about regulatory oversight has led to apprehension regarding enforcement actions, with many stakeholders worried about engaging with the sector. The current administration aims to eliminate these ambiguities by proposing legislation that would assign the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) oversight of the cryptocurrency spot market . This shift would alleviate concerns that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might assert jurisdiction, imposing stringent securities regulations on crypto companies. Recently, the House of Representatives passed the Clarity Act, which seeks to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework, though it still requires Senate approval. Ethereum At The Forefront Another key element of Trump‚Äôs roadmap is the integration of decentralized finance (DeFi) into traditional financial systems. The administration is advocating for legislative measures that recognize the potential of DeFi technologies, which rely on decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. Ethereum‚Äôs blockchain is at the forefront of this movement, according to the firm‚Äôs analysis, serving as the primary platform for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Smart contracts automate various processes, executing agreements when specific conditions are met. For instance, in real estate, a smart contract could streamline mortgage transactions by automatically executing terms once necessary documentation and payments are provided. With over half of all decentralized applications operating on the Ethereum blockchain , an expansion of decentralized finance could significantly boost the use and adoption of Ethereum itself. Additionally, the administration is focusing on stablecoins, a crucial area within the cryptocurrency landscape. Recently signed into law, the GENIUS Act aims to establish a regulatory framework for the integration of stablecoins into broader payment systems. Their appeal lies in the ability to use US Treasury securities as a reserve pool, potentially increasing demand for Treasuries and aiding in the management of national debt. The White House‚Äôs fact sheet emphasizes that the widespread adoption of dollar-backed stablecoins could modernize payment infrastructure, moving the US away from outdated systems. Notably, a substantial portion of stablecoin transactions, especially from leading stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC), occur on the Ethereum network, highlighting its central role in the ecosystem.

DeSoc Launches Viral Presale As Solana and Dogecoin Investors Pile In,https://thecoinrise.com/is-this-the-future-of-social-media-desoc-launches-viral-presale-as-solana-and-dogecoin-investors-pile-in/,"A new wave of investor interest is emerging around DeSoc , a blockchain-based social media platform that is shaking up the status quo with its innovative viral presale. As crypto users seek more meaningful use cases and fresh narratives beyond the usual DeFi cycles, DeSoc‚Äôs approach is striking a chord, especially with investors coming from Solana and Dogecoin. The project isn‚Äôt just another token launch. It‚Äôs setting up the groundwork for a full-on decentralized social media ecosystem, combining content monetization, microtransactions, and governance into one system, all powered by the $SOCS token. At just $0.01 per token and with 12 presale stages, early adopters are getting a first look at what some believe could become crypto‚Äôs answer to Instagram and Twitter. DeSoc: Content Meets Crypto Utility DeSoc‚Äôs real value lies in how it blends familiar social media behavior with tokenized incentives. Through content syndication, users can publish posts directly on DeSoc and have them appear across various platforms, including Instagram, Facebook, X, and TikTok. That cross-platform presence keeps creators visible while giving them token-based rewards for quality content, engagement, or exclusive posts. The platform introduces a reward system for content creators, tipping tools, premium subscriptions, and even micropayments for unlocking certain posts. Users can promote content, donate to causes, and engage in peer-to-peer transactions, all using $SOCS. DeSoc also features tokenized governance, smart contracts for proposal execution, and a transparent API system for seamless integration with existing social networks. The tokenomics support this vision: 45% of the total 3 billion supply is allocated to the new viral presale , 20% reserved for development, 15% for marketing, and 10% each for liquidity and community rewards. Solana‚Äôs Growth Story vs. DeSoc‚Äôs Value Proposition Solana has been on a run. The price recently touched $200 before pulling back to around $181, reflecting a 50% rally over the past month. Its ETF debut raised $100 million in just 12 days , and MetaMask‚Äôs new support for Solana adds another layer of accessibility. On the DeFi side, Solana‚Äôs total value locked is closing in on $10 billion, overtaking BNB in some key areas. Still, the surge hasn‚Äôt gone unnoticed by traders looking for entry points or exit ramps. A common concern is whether Solana‚Äôs price action is sustainable at these highs or whether capital could rotate into lower-cap, utility-driven projects like DeSoc. While Solana‚Äôs ecosystem continues expanding, it largely caters to developers and large-scale projects. By contrast, DeSoc appeals directly to everyday users, creators, and community builders. Dogecoin‚Äôs Latest Updates Spark New Interest Don‚Äôt count Dogecoin out just yet. According to recent chart analysis, DOGE is retesting the neckline of a double bottom formation , typically a bullish pattern. It recently reached a local high of $0.288 before correcting and is now hovering around $0.2388. Buyers are watching closely, with support near $0.235 holding strong. Dogecoin‚Äôs latest updates also highlight a larger truth about the token it still boasts one of the most passionate communities in the crypto space. But while it thrives on memes and culture, it‚Äôs limited in what users can actually do with it. DeSoc, by contrast, offers that same community-driven vibe but adds something Dogecoin lacks: utility. Dogecoin traders seeking the next wave may find DeSoc‚Äôs new viral presale to be a more functional pivot one that still values the community, but also empowers it. The New Viral Presale Worth Your Money Between Dogecoin‚Äôs latest updates and Solana‚Äôs recent price action, it‚Äôs clear the crypto market isn‚Äôt short on excitement. But if the goal is long-term returns rooted in adoption and utility, DeSoc‚Äôs new viral presale stands out. It offers a rare combination: creator monetization, decentralized governance, cross-platform functionality, and user-first economics. If you‚Äôre tired of speculating and want a chance to get in on something with real-world traction, $SOCS may be your best bet this year. The early presale is now live, but at $0.01, it may not remain that low for long. Discover the future of decentralized social infrastructure with DeSoc.

At the time of writing, DOGE is trading around $0.2035, showing signs of consolidation after a turbulent few months. The current setup has some analysts predicting a potential breakout, especially if capital continues rotating out of large caps like Bitcoin and Ethereum and into more speculative assets. Emerging altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE have also entered the conversation. With momentum mirroring early-stage success stories like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, the project is attracting investors hoping to secure ground-floor positions before potential exchange listings. Solana‚Äôs Capital Rotation Could Trigger DOGE Rally One of the major forces pushing attention back toward Dogecoin is the recent rotation of liquidity within the altcoin space. As seen with Solana‚Äôs sharp rise and subsequent pullback, traders are clearly reallocating funds based on short-term momentum and long-term narratives. DOGE, still one of the most recognizable cryptocurrencies globally, is benefiting from this environment. If current trends continue and investor appetite grows during the next altcoin cycle, some price forecasts suggest DOGE could aim for $0.50‚Äì$1.00 by 2026‚Äîespecially if market sentiment remains strong and retail participation increases. Why Investors Are Watching This New Altcoin Closely While meme coins like Dogecoin have historically offered explosive upside, the real buzz is now shifting toward MAGACOIN FINANCE. The project has been gaining massive traction thanks to its limited presale access and strong community backing. Traders are now speculating MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver a 38x gains , potentially outperforming legacy meme coins during the next rally. What‚Äôs drawing comparisons to Solana‚Äôs early days is its rapidly growing ecosystem and timed market entry‚Äîright as capital is flowing potentially high-reward assets. What Could Fuel DOGE‚Äôs Next Big Move Several factors could set the stage for a new Dogecoin rally: Retail-driven momentum: DOGE remains a favorite among social media traders and retail investors. Celebrity attention: Any renewed buzz from high-profile figures could reignite interest. Altcoin cycle timing: The next market-wide rally could shift capital into high-volatility assets like DOGE. Exchange upgrades and adoption: Increased integration and use cases could boost long-term value. Whale accumulation: If larger holders return, it could signal a stronger bullish trend ahead. Could DOGE Hit $1? While reaching $1 would require a significant rally, it‚Äôs not entirely out of the question‚Äîespecially if Dogecoin captures enough momentum during the next altcoin season. That said, the market is evolving, and many investors are now looking beyond traditional meme coins. The growing attention around MAGACOIN FINANCE, especially with projections of 38x returns , underscores how investor behavior is shifting toward newer, faster-moving opportunities.

Analysts now have their eyes on three top-notch projects that offer more than hype: Avalanche (AVAX), Solana (SOL), and DeSoc (SOCS) . Each of these altcoins brings something unique to the table, be it super-fast smart contracts, a growing dApp ecosystem, or going big on decentralized social infrastructure. With real-world utility, developer adoption, and growing communities backing them, these altcoins are being described as the top cryptos to invest in now by retail and institutional voices alike. Let‚Äôs dive into the numbers and why these three are causing a splash in 2025. AVAX has Resisted Despite the Price Drop Avalanche , at other times praised for its speed and scalability, now trades at $23.39, down by 6.45% over the last 24 hours. Its market cap is $9.87 billion, trading volume of $890.5 million, which went down somewhat by 1.62%. Despite this fall, AVAX is still a force to be reckoned with in the smart contract arena. The subnet architecture of the protocol allows developers to deploy extremely flexible blockchains tailored for specific applications, from gaming to DeFi. With institutional buying picking up steam and consistent updates on the roadmap, Avalanche is still a low-gas-fee cryptocurrency with long-term prospects. Solana‚Äôs Strength Keeps It In The Top Tier Solana (SOL) , the erstwhile ‚ÄúEthereum killer,‚Äù was trading at $184.52, a 6.79% dip in the last twenty-four hours. Its market cap is still at $99.48 billion, with trading volume showing a 14.1% increase to now at $11.49 billion. SOL remains standing tall for its extremely fast transaction times and ridiculously low fees and is quickly becoming the chain of choice for NFT portals, GameFi platforms, and scalable DeFi applications. The recent drop is regarded by analysts as a much-needed correction and not something to be worried about, especially as Solana-based projects continue to go strong. Still, for those who are looking for the next 100x crypto, there are others peering elsewhere to a new star by the name of DeSoc. DeSoc: The Viral Social Layer Web3 Desperately Needs While AVAX and Solana are scaling transactions, DeSoc is scaling something arguably much bigger: social identity and reputation across the decentralized web. DeSoc (Decentralized Social) fuels a unified identity layer for Web2 and Web3. From Farcaster to Twitter and Lens, the SOCS token enables users and devs to sync identity, build trust, and monetize influence across platforms. The SOCS token is now in presale, but it‚Äôs already made waves with over $10 million raised in just over a week, with pundits calling it the best altcoin to buy today for those planning ahead for 2025. What‚Äôs behind the DeSoc buzz? Decentralized identity across numerous platforms SOCS token used for staking and voting APIs for creating social tools that developers will love Reputation tracking and monetization of content Over $10 million raised, and early-bird rewards are live Whereas AVAX and Solana are taking care of the infrastructure needs at the base level, DeSoc is targeting what is missing: the people layer. In a global ecosystem where developers, influencers, and creators survive on social identity and trust, DeSoc can be the glue that holds the Web3 world together. Final Take: Balance The Present With The Future AVAX and Solana have already proven themselves, delivering reliability and scale to Web3 today. But if you want to know where the next wave of growth and innovation will arrive from, DeSoc has a compelling case. Its social-first design takes advantage of one of Web3‚Äôs most valuable assets: reputation. Add to this its developer-focused stack and user demand accelerating at an alarming speed, and it‚Äôs little wonder that SOCS tokens are vanishing fast from presale.

49662610,https://timestabloid.com/?p=77161,1754523037,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP Price Outlook if It Captures 10% of Global Real Estate Transactions,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-price-outlook-if-it-captures-10-of-global-real-estate-transactions/,"XRP is currently trading at $3.00 with a market capitalization of approximately $177.9 billion. Despite recent market fluctuations, the token has recorded a 38% increase in value this year and a notable 480% surge since November 2024. Even with this significant upward trend, several market analysts continue to suggest that XRP‚Äôs current valuation does not fully reflect its potential. A key argument supporting this view is the increasing adoption of XRP as a bridge currency for global payments. One area where this function could be expanded is the real estate sector, particularly in facilitating cross-border property transactions. As international property sales continue to grow, the question arises: What could XRP be worth if it became a key settlement tool in this domain? Global Real Estate Volume and XRP‚Äôs Hypothetical Role In 2024, the global real estate market, encompassing both residential and commercial transactions, reached a total volume of $703 billion , representing a 14% year-over-year increase. Of this, the Americas accounted for $372 billion, while the EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) region recorded $199 billion. The Asia-Pacific region contributed $131 billion. Activity intensified in the fourth quarter of the year, during which deal volume alone reached $232 billion. In a hypothetical model, if XRP were to facilitate the entirety of these cross-border property transactions, it would need to function as both a transactional intermediary and a temporary store of value. In this scenario, financial institutions, real estate firms, and investors would rely on XRP to enhance the speed and efficiency of international settlements. This would require deep liquidity and sustained demand, likely leading to upward pressure on its market value. Projected Valuations Based on Market Integration To estimate XRP‚Äôs potential price in this hypothetical context, a capital multiplier model was applied. In crypto markets, the market cap of an asset can expand significantly beyond the nominal capital inflow due to increased demand and limited supply. Multiplier effects typically range from 5x to 15x but may rise further in highly bullish market conditions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A multiplier of 10x was applied to the $703 billion in global real estate transactions, resulting in a projected market capitalization of $7.03 trillion for XRP. Given its current circulating supply of 59.3 billion tokens, this scenario implies a token price of approximately $118.55. For a more conservative estimate, a 5x multiplier was also considered. Under this model, the projected market cap would be $3.515 trillion, leading to a token price of $59.3. Even in this restrained case, XRP‚Äôs price would increase almost twentyfold from its current value. While it is unlikely that XRP will fully dominate the global real estate transaction landscape in the near term, partial adoption could still have a meaningful impact on its valuation. Should XRP capture even 5% to 10% of the annual global property transaction volume, its value could reasonably increase to a range between $6 and $12. This analysis presents a speculative but data-driven assessment of how XRP‚Äôs utility could extend beyond traditional financial remittances into larger and more complex sectors such as real estate. Although full integration remains hypothetical, the potential for growth underscores XRP‚Äôs relevance in broader financial infrastructure.

As meme coins blow up and Layer 1s struggle with congestion wars, there‚Äôs one project that‚Äôs rewriting the playbook quietly, and investors are snapping up on it fast. Say hello to DeSoc , the decentralized social identity platform that has already hit over $10 million in weeks, one of the best crypto presales to invest in today. Backed by a solid use case, expert credibility, and a growing base of believers, DeSoc is not just a coin. It‚Äôs the connective tissue Web3 has lacked. What Is DeSoc and Why Is It Booming? Short for ‚ÄúDecentralized Social,‚Äù DeSoc is solving one of crypto‚Äôs most important problems: fractured identity. Today, your identity on X (Twitter), Farcaster, Discord, or Lens exists in separate silos. DeSoc tackles that by unifying identity, social credibility, and influence across Web2 and Web3. Developed with creators, developers, and communities in mind, the SOCS token is for staking, governance, and powering the tools that make decentralized reputation possible. Here‚Äôs why analysts are so hot on it: One Identity Layer for Web2 and Web3 Developer APIs to build social tools and platforms Staking rewards and governance are built in Creator monetization through social reputation metrics Raised over $10M, with a presale that‚Äôs red hot in seconds If you slept on early Ethereum or Solana, DeSoc might be your second chance at a high-utility gem before it becomes mainstream. Experts Say It Ticks All The Right Boxes Analysts are already referring to DeSoc as one of the next 100x crypto projects, and rightly so. It sits at the intersection of multiple popular narratives: decentralized identity, social finance (SoFi), creator tools, and Web3 reputation. Even better? It‚Äôs live and currently under construction, not just a roadmap fantasy. In a space that‚Äôs too rich in speculation, DeSoc brings actual use-case utility: Synchronize identity across platforms Boost trust with on-chain reputation Developers can build using friendly APIs Token utility includes staking, governance, and creator rewards Growing quickly with smart early adopters $10 Million Raised and Growing DeSoc‚Äôs presale is blazing. Collecting well over $10 million in just weeks, early investors are racing to buy tokens before the next price level. The team also hinted at a series of high-profile partnerships, alongside an imminent testnet integration and dApp builder tools, which could open the door to thousands of apps supported by DeSoc‚Äôs identity platform. Early adopters get limited-time perks, so the timing is ideal to join now. Why DeSoc Trounces Other Presales Let‚Äôs be real, most presales these days are either memecoin or mysterious whitepaper hype. DeSoc isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs founded on Web3‚Äôs biggest requirement: verifiable identity and trust. It‚Äôs not a token with ambitions of being the next Dogecoin. It‚Äôs infrastructure. It‚Äôs designed for a purpose. It‚Äôs what Web3 has been missing. With the SOCS token powering the whole platform, early adopters are poised to ride along as growth persists, and in light of the $10 Million+ having been raised, it seems that they won‚Äôt be riding solo. Final Thought: Get In While It‚Äôs Early The presale window is still open, but it won‚Äôt be around forever. With its strong foundations, growing developer interest, and clearly articulated roadmap, DeSoc is quickly becoming the savvy investor‚Äôs best option for long-term returns.

49663028,https://thecoinrise.com/xrp-news-today-ripple-drops-below-3-as-investors-show-interest-in-new-defi-social-media-platform/,1754523611,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/49663028.jpeg,XRP News Today: Ripple Drops Below $3 As Investors Show Interest In New DeFi Social Media Platform,https://thecoinrise.com/xrp-news-today-ripple-drops-below-3-as-investors-show-interest-in-new-defi-social-media-platform/,"XRP has been a constant in the crypto universe for quite some time, with praise for its application in cross-border payments and victory in court over the SEC. Yet even traditional tokens are not exempt from investor mood swings. As of now, XRP has dipped below $3 , now selling at $3.10, a decline of 9.92%, though it recorded an astronomical 146.97% increase in day-to-day trading volume to more than $17.19 billion. So what‚Äôs going on? Yes, part of the decline can be attributed to profit-taking and market fluctuation, but there‚Äôs another trend in play too: investors relocating capital into fresh opportunities, namely, into next-gen DeFi social platforms like DeSoc . What‚Äôs Driven XRP‚Äôs Decline Despite Ripple‚Äôs persistent existence and real-world implementations, XRP has not been immune to overall sell-offs. The recent drop below the psychological $3 level is suspect considering the surge in trading volume, which typically signals either whale activity or bulk redemptions. Analysts suggest the following could be at play: Profit-taking following XRP‚Äôs recent rally over $3.30 Soliciting investor interest in more revolutionary altcoins Rotation within the market from old-school tokens to presale-stage ventures FOMO in new spaces such as decentralized identity and DeFi social This is not necessarily terrible news for XRP long-term, but short-term sentiment very much indicates retail and early adopters are searching for the next breakout. DeSoc: The Web3 Social Layer That‚Äôs Turning Heads Whereas XRP stumbles under the pressure of price, a new challenger is stepping into the limelight. DeSoc Decentralized Social is becoming the Web3 identity layer, uniting users on social platforms, chains, and communities. It‚Äôs a purpose-built project for the post-X (Twitter) world, where decentralized influence, on-chain trust, and creator ownership are more critical than ever. And the stats don‚Äôt lie: Raised over $10 million in its current presale SOCS token facilitates governance, staking, and developer functions Massive adoption by developers, influencers, and Web3 creators Cross-platform identity mapping from Web2 to Web3 Reputation rewards, not speculation In a nutshell, DeSoc is social media reimagined for crypto, and interest is high. Why Investors Are Flocking to DeSoc The crypto world is no longer satisfied with passive investment. What they are looking for now is utility, community, and upside potential, and DeSoc delivers all three. Here‚Äôs how it‚Äôs grabbing attention: Cross-chain social identity on dApps, DAOs, and Web2 Creator economy with reputation-based incentives Developer-friendly APIs for building new dApps and social tools SOCS staking with passive income and governance impact Staggering early traction with over $10M raised For investors who missed out early on Solana or Arbitrum, DeSoc is a do-over, better vision to boot. From XRP to DeSoc: Is This a Strategic Shift? Not only are XRP holders selling, but they‚Äôre strategically moving into altcoins with a definite roadmap and strong user base demand. DeSoc is not competing with Ripple‚Äôs payment rails, but it‚Äôs fixing a larger problem in the crypto ecosystem: Who do you trust online and how do you prove it? By offering portable digital identities that contain social trust and sway, DeSoc becomes infrastructure for Web3, and not just a token. Last Take: Is Time to Diversify? XRP is not going away. But its recent decline shows even top-shelf cryptos need more than hype to sustain the momentum. Conversely, DeSoc is offering something XRP can‚Äôt: an entirely new utility layer for the decentralized internet. As the presale continues to gain traction, early investors are locking in before the next wave of growth. If you‚Äôre exploring high-utility altcoins and want exposure to the growing DeFi + Social intersection, DeSoc may just be your smartest next move.

49663628,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=780683,1754524023,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/49663628.jpeg,Tim Cook joins Trump at White House for Apple investment announcement,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/apple-pledges-100b-for-us-manufacturing/,"Apple is adding $100 billion to its U.S. manufacturing plans following a closed-door meeting between Tim Cook and President Donald Trump at the White House on Wednesday. This comes as the company tries to protect its core product line from a new wave of tariffs and stay on the administration‚Äôs good side while still depending heavily on overseas factories. Trump is expected to personally announce Apple‚Äôs new pledge at the White House event where Cook will also be present. The plan involves setting up a new domestic manufacturing program to pull more of the company‚Äôs supply chain into the U.S. This includes building and assembling more critical components locally to avoid new trade penalties. It adds to Apple‚Äôs earlier promise of $500 billion, which covered projects like a server manufacturing site in Houston, a supplier training center in Michigan, and more money flowing to existing American vendors. With this new pledge, Apple‚Äôs total investment in the U.S. now stands at $600 billion. Trump raises tariffs while Apple tries to hold ground White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers tied the new investment directly to Trump‚Äôs economic goals, saying: ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs announcement with Apple is another win for our manufacturing industry that will simultaneously help reshore the production of critical components to protect America‚Äôs economic and national security.‚Äù Apple‚Äôs stock rose 6% on Wednesday after the pledge, which is its biggest intraday gain since February. Meanwhile, Trump also signed an executive order adding another 25% tariff on goods from India in response to its Russian oil purchases, in addition to a separate 25% duty already scheduled to hit the next day. Apple‚Äôs major reliance on India for iPhone assembly makes it a direct target. Trump has repeatedly pushed Apple to move full iPhone manufacturing to U.S. factories. Earlier this year, after a meeting with Cook, Trump threatened a 25% tariff if the company didn‚Äôt act. While officials have floated ideas like robotics for U.S. assembly, Cook has focused more on securing tariff exemptions. He did this successfully during Trump‚Äôs first term and has been working to do it again. Last week, during a call with analysts, Cook admitted that ‚Äúthe vast majority‚Äù of iPhones sold in the U.S. are still made in India. He added that other products such as MacBooks, iPads, and Apple Watches come from Vietnam. ‚ÄúWe obviously try to optimize our supply chain,‚Äù Cook said. ‚ÄúAnd ultimately, we will do more in the United States.‚Äù Cook also said Apple took an $800 million hit from tariffs in the last quarter and expects that number to rise to $1.1 billion by the end of September unless there are changes in trade policy. That pressure is only increasing. Trump is now preparing to target all products with semiconductor chips with new levies, which could drop as soon as next week. He‚Äôs also expanding country-specific tariffs that will hit dozens of trade partners on Thursday. Trump‚Äôs track record with Apple shows a pattern. During his first term, Cook managed to get several of Apple‚Äôs products exempted from import duties. If he can pull that off again, it could help Apple avoid price hikes that would squeeze its margins, or worse, give competitors like Samsung a pricing advantage. The initial $500 billion commitment Apple made in February included a promise to add 20,000 jobs, but the numbers weren‚Äôt much beyond its previously announced plans. That pledge only added $39 billion and around 1,000 jobs per year. The extra $100 billion is meant to reinforce its U.S. ties ahead of a broader trade crackdown. The Apple news fits into a string of public investment rollouts from the Trump administration. Earlier this year, Trump hosted a joint announcement with Oracle, SoftBank, and OpenAI, revealing a $100 billion investment in AI data centers with plans to hit $500 billion. Separately, Trump said Nvidia plans to manufacture up to $500 billion in AI infrastructure inside the U.S. through new partnerships. The White House has also linked trade deals directly to investment promises. In an agreement with the European Union, Trump secured $750 billion in American energy exports and $600 billion in U.S. investments. A similar deal with Japan led to a $550 billion investment fund targeting American projects.

Investors Rush To New Viral Social Media Altcoin,https://thecoinrise.com/dogecoin-latest-news-could-doge-hit-1-in-2025-investors-rush-to-new-viral-social-media-altcoin/,"Dogecoin is again at the forefront of crypto investors‚Äô minds, with people wondering if this meme token is about to penetrate the long-awaited $1 price point in 2025. After all, this token formed through a community of believers has taken a few more than a few by surprise before. But while some HODLers bet even larger on DOGE, a new trend is forming: investors are setting their sights on a fresh Web3 altcoin that combines DeFi and social media DeSoc . Let‚Äôs get into where DOGE stands today and why this fresh new project is generating so much excitement from meme coin fans. DOGE Drops, But Volume Skyrockets: Can $1 Still Happen? Dogecoin itself sits at $0.2378, down 7.19% in the last 24 hours. Although it did dip, volume has spiked up 72.72%, reaching $5.46 billion, showing DOGE is nowhere near the back burner. Its cap is solid at $35.74 billion, making it well within top crypto valuables. But can it get to $1 in 2025? Experts are split. DOGE has demonstrated its ability to come back strong on social sentiment, influencer backing, and macro trends. But a full dollar will take more than good vibes; it‚Äôll require substantial network growth, utility adoption, and a favorable market cycle. Still, as long as it‚Äôs Elon Musk‚Äôs meme sweetheart and a means of payment in his world, DOGE will never cease to amaze. The Shift to New Tales: Why Meme Coin Investors Turn to DeSoc Dogecoin and Shiba Inu started as jokes, but they built communities so strong that full ecosystems were created. Nowadays, that same community-based might is spreading to projects that blend social value with real crypto utility. Meet DeSoc , a brand-new altcoin trending viral for all the wrong reasons, that is, not because of memes, but because it‚Äôs revolutionizing Web3 identity and decentralized social platforms for good. Here‚Äôs what DOGE holders are jumping in for: Utility-based demand in the next bull cycle Potential for early entry with explosive returns Top-of-mind resonance with decentralized, open-source philosophies Crypto-native social applications that reward influence and trust DOGE cleared the way for DeSoc to operate, and meme fanatics are already hoarding. What Is DeSoc? The DeFi Social Coin Making Waves DeSoc isn‚Äôt a token; it‚Äôs a social infrastructure layer of the decentralized web. It‚Äôs designed to link digital identities between wallets, chains, and platforms, solving a massive problem in crypto: identity fragmentation. Some of the main features are: On-chain social reputation mapped across dApps SOCS token-based governance, rewarding real engagement Simple-to-use APIs for devs to construct social dApps DeFi x Social integration, staking, and reputation-based rewards Over $10 million raised in a viral presale DeSoc is not looking to replace DOGE it‚Äôs developing a whole new lane for crypto adoption. It‚Äôs where utility, influence, and reward meet. DOGE to DeSoc: The Evolution of Community Power What Dogecoin demonstrated is that a strong, passionate community can fuel exponential growth. But whereas DOGE is built on culture and support, DeSoc is building a protocol on the same power, giving it shape, function, and scalability. Meme coin holders know better than anyone the strength of narrative. Now they‚Äôre applying that knowledge up front in efforts such as DeSoc, where value is derived from participation, not speculation. Last Word: Two Tokens, One Direction? Dogecoin can be said to still be an outsider for the $1 mark, especially with its massive trading volume and community backing in the market. And in looking for ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs next,‚Äù most expect the likes of DeSoc , which has something DOGE lacks, an ability to assist in mainstreaming the future of decentralized identity and shape. Be you meme warrior or a utility maxi, 2025 can be the year of both DOGE and DeSoc, both prospering, just differently. Discover the future of decentralized social infrastructure with DeSoc.

Optimism price prediction for 2028 suggests the token could reach a maximum value of $11.14. In 2031, OP tokens will range between $27.9 and $33.66, with an average value of $28.88. Optimism‚Äôs (OP) commitment to innovation is highlighted by its support for Layer-3 solutions. These solutions enable the development of decentralized applications (dApps) on top of Layer-2 chains, contributing to the expansive Optimism Superchain. The platform‚Äôs initiatives, including introducing custom gas tokens and Plasma mode aimed at reducing onboarding and operational costs, make it more accessible for new users and developers. As the market closely watches the price movements and growth trajectory of the token, can Optimism reach $10 soon? Let‚Äôs get into the OP price prediction for 2025 ‚Äì 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Optimism Token OP Price $0.6681 Market Cap $1.17B Trading Volume $161.74M Circulating Supply 1.75B OP All-time High $4.85 (Mar 06, 2024) All-time Low $0.4005 (Jun 18, 2022) 24-hour High $0.6758 24-hour Low $0.6423 Optimism price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 9.68% 50-Day SMA $0.6526 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 54 (Neutral) Green Days 20/30 (67%) 200-Day SMA $0.9632 Optimism price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: OP is trading within $0.65-$0.68 range with diminishing volume. Technical convergence suggests a potential breakout, but indicators favour a downside. Optimism 1-day price chart As of August 6, 2025, OP is trading at $0.667 with a modest +0.91% gain, demonstrating resilience after experiencing significant volatility in recent sessions. The daily chart reveals price action oscillating within a defined range, with the middle Bollinger bands currently positioned around $0.715 at the upper boundary and $0.614 at the lower boundary. OPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The recent candle formation shows alternating red and green sessions, suggesting indecision among market participants, while the balance of power indicator at 0.16 hints at slight bullish momentum building beneath the surface. However, the declining OBV trend from 786.33M raises concerns about weakening volume support, which could limit any potential upside breakout attempts and suggests that institutional interest may be waning during this consolidation phase. Optimism 4-hour price chart The 4-hour chart shows OP down -0.30% from recent highs, while the Alligator indicator shows convergence at the $0.667-$0.669 range, indicating a potential directional decision point approaching. OPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The price has been respecting multiple moving average levels, creating a technical standoff where neither bulls nor bears have gained decisive control, and the 24-hour volume of 16.39M appears adequate but not explosive enough to suggest imminent breakout momentum. The CMF reading of -0.03 signals slight money flow weakness, indicating that despite the relatively stable price action, underlying buying pressure remains subdued and smart money may be quietly rotating out of positions. Optimism technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.6660 BUY SMA 5 $0.6856 SELL SMA 10 $0.7116 SELL SMA 21 $0.7412 SELL SMA 50 $0.6526 BUY SMA 100 $0.6913 SELL SMA 200 $0.9632 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.6805 SELL EMA 5 $0.6686 SELL EMA 10 $0.6672 BUY EMA 21 $0.6990 SELL EMA 50 $0.8266 SELL EMA 100 $1.0544 SELL EMA 200 $1.3483 SELL What to expect from Optimism? OP is likely to keep ranging between $0.65 and $0.68, with direction hinging on volume and market sentiment. Weak volume and negative money flow hint at a possible downside break in the coming sessions. Is Optimism a good crypto investment? Optimism (OP) could be a good investment if you believe in Ethereum scaling and the growth of Layer 2 solutions. However, like all crypto, it‚Äôs risky, and its value depends on adoption and market trends. Only invest what you‚Äôre willing to lose! Will OP recover? A recovery is possible, but we fear the overall bearish sentiment makes a short-term rebound unlikely. However, as the market consolidates, we expect reduced volatility, which may lead to a breakout in either direction, depending on market dynamics. Will Optimism reach $10? Yes, Optimism is projected to close up to $10 by 2028. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in its price. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and require unprecedented growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook.

Optimism historic price sentiment Optimism price history by Coingecko OP launched with an initial value of $4.57 on May 31 but dropped sharply in June due to the UST stablecoin de-pegging and LUNA collapse, closing June at $0.5434. It further declined to $0.4147 by mid-July. In August, OP briefly surged above $1.90, but by mid-October, it dropped to $0.70 following the FTX collapse. In Q1 2023, OP surged past $3.00 during a crypto bull run but lost 66% shortly after. A recovery saw it close the year at $3.90. OP saw an eventful 2024, reaching an all-time high of $4.85 in March before sliding below $2.30 by mid-April. After a brief recovery to over $2.90 in May, it entered a bearish phase, trading at $1.82‚Äì$1.96 by July and $1.54‚Äì$1.62 by October. November brought a spark of hope with a peak at $2.60. OP closed December within the range of $1.611‚Äì$2.773. In January 2025, OP peaked at $2.18 but lost momentum, dropping to as low as $0.84 in February.

While other presales wait behind coming-soon tags, BlockDAG (BDAG) puts users in control now. It shows the full setup before listings begin. So far, BlockDAG has raised $363 million, sold more than 24.7 billion coins, and moved into batch 29 with a price of $0.0276. That reflects a 2,660% ROI since batch 1. Still, the limited-time price of $0.0016 offers a major entry point. It allows early buyers to lock in the price before any listing changes happen. For those who want more than a placeholder, and are looking for access to real trading tools before launch, BlockDAG stands out as the most complete option right now. Chainlink (LINK) Chainlink remains a leading tool for bringing off-chain data onto the blockchain. Its Oracle system supports major parts of crypto like DeFi, NFTs, and digital insurance. With support across Ethereum, Solana, and several Layer-2 networks, it powers apps that need price data, sports updates, or weather inputs. As new trends like AI and DePIN grow, Chainlink‚Äôs role as a trusted data link keeps expanding. It‚Äôs already working with major players such as Swift and DTCC, pointing to more real-world use cases for decentralized finance. Though it might not bring fast price spikes, Chainlink is known for steady value and strong utility. It suits those who want exposure to crypto tools that support major apps. For 2025, it remains one of the best crypto to buy in 2025 for steady and useful growth. Mantle (MNT) Mantle is a fresh Layer-2 scaling system that stands on solid ground. It‚Äôs backed by BitDAO‚Äôs large treasury, which controls more than $2 billion in assets. This gives Mantle strong funding and a place among the best-supported Ethereum scaling networks. Unlike projects that rely on short-term interest, Mantle is quietly building long-term solutions for both performance and decision-making. It uses EigenDA for flexible data access and supports builders and liquidity with its native asset. What makes Mantle stand out is how its setup goes beyond paying gas fees. It connects to a larger system of rewards linked to BitDAO. As more apps launch and funds are used, this setup could drive more usage and price movement. In 2025, Mantle offers a powerful setup, making it one of the best crypto to buy in 2025 for structure and potential. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu started as a meme, but now it runs its own blockchain, exchange, and virtual world. Its network includes Shibarium, SHIB: The Metaverse, and ShibaSwap, a platform for trading digital assets. Going into 2025, SHIB is focusing on growing its tools and user control. Shibarium now supports transactions using BONE, and SHIB supply continues to shrink with regular burns, all while more users join the ecosystem. While it began as a meme, SHIB now brings more to the table than many expect. It mixes strong community backing with new features that boost its value. Though riskier than others here, it‚Äôs still one of the best cryptos to buy in 2025 for those aiming at bigger swings and high reward chances. Final Take Picking the best crypto to buy in 2025 means looking at tools, trust, and actual use. BlockDAG checks all the boxes, with a working trading platform and an entry price that gives more room for gains. Chainlink stays strong as the network backbone, Mantle brings funded growth options, and Shiba Inu moves from hype to working systems. Each one fits a different type of goal, but BlockDAG is moving ahead while others are still setting up.

However, despite this increase in on-chain fundamentals, ETH‚Äôs price continues to trade below major resistance levels, raising concerns that bullish momentum may be fading. Ethereum Network Activity Picks Momentum According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor CryptoOnChain, Ethereum‚Äôs daily transaction count ‚Äì highlighted in pink in the below chart ‚Äì has surged to a new ATH of approximately 1,550,000 transactions per day. This sharp increase in daily transactions, particularly noticeable over the past few months, points to intensified on-chain usage and overall network engagement. In addition to transaction count, other metrics also reflect a spike in activity ‚Äì most notably, the number of unique Ethereum addresses. As of August 5, the total number of unique Ethereum addresses stood at 332,122,674, marking an increase of 207,454 new wallets compared to the previous day. While some of these may belong to existing users creating new addresses, the majority likely represent new participants entering the Ethereum ecosystem. Related Reading: Ethereum Rally Not Fueled By Bitcoin Dump, On-Chain Signals Show CryptoOnChain emphasized that despite these bullish on-chain signals, Ethereum‚Äôs price has not followed suit. As shown in the above chart, ETH‚Äôs price ‚Äì highlighted in orange ‚Äì remains subdued, failing to break above prior highs or key resistance zones. This disconnect between rising network fundamentals and lagging price action may indicate that the market is in an accumulation phase, the analyst said. CryptoOnChain further suggested that Ethereum could be setting the stage for a significant bullish breakout, with potential upside targets reaching as high as $5,000. Is ETH Price Headed For A New ATH? In a separate analysis posted on X, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto shared the following ETH monthly chart, noting that the asset is ‚Äúcompressing within a massive monthly triangle.‚Äù According to the analyst, a successful breakout from this pattern could potentially drive ETH toward $8,000. For the uninitiated, the triangle pattern is a chart formation that occurs when price action consolidates between converging trendlines, forming a shape that resembles a triangle. It typically indicates a period of indecision that often resolves with a breakout in the direction of the prior trend, signaling continuation or reversal depending on the context. Related Reading: Is Ethereum Gearing Up for a Major Move? Analysts Split on What‚Äôs Next Another well-known analyst, Gert van Lagen, echoed a similar outlook. He noted that ETH may be positioning for a powerful breakout, with a projected price target of up to $9,000, citing growing technical and fundamental support. Meanwhile, on-chain exchange data also supports a bullish narrative. Over the past two weeks, more than 1 million ETH has been withdrawn from centralized exchanges ‚Äì fuelling speculations about a potential supply crunch. At press time, ETH trades at $3,590, down 1.1% in the past 24 hours.

Investors are already speculating that such a move could reignite an explosive altcoin season‚Äîone that mirrors the massive runs seen during Ethereum and Bitcoin ETF approvals. The excitement is also pushing attention toward lesser-known opportunities, with MAGACOIN FINANCE emerging as a standout contender. Its potential upside has analysts comparing it to XRP‚Äôs 2017 bull market surge. XRP ETF Hype Heats Up After years of legal hurdles, Ripple appears to be on the verge of a breakthrough. Sources close to the matter suggest that discussions with major financial institutions‚Äîincluding BlackRock and Fidelity‚Äîare ramping up, with ETF paperwork likely to follow once Ripple‚Äôs final settlement with the SEC is confirmed. This would mark a huge shift in how institutional investors access XRP and could drive billions in capital into the asset. Historically, similar ETF approvals have triggered steep price rallies. For example, Bitcoin surged over 60% after the spot ETF greenlight earlier this year, and Ethereum saw double-digit gains ahead of its futures-based ETF. XRP‚Äôs price currently sits near $2.45, and many believe the ETF news could push it past its previous all-time high of $3.84. This Altcoin Could Outperform If XRP Ignites the Market With attention building around Ripple, smart money is starting to look for altcoins that could ride the ETF wave. That‚Äôs where MAGACOIN FINANCE enters the picture. Analysts say this new project could deliver up to 20,300% gains , thanks to its growing community, real-world use cases , and ongoing development. The presale is gaining traction fast, with early investors already seeing impressive growth. If the XRP ETF unlocks a fresh altcoin rally, MAGACOIN FINANCE could become one of the biggest winners, offering a high-risk, high-reward entry for forward-thinking investors. What Comes Next for XRP and Altcoins? The countdown to August 15, 2025, is critical. That‚Äôs the deadline for Ripple and the SEC to file their joint status update, widely expected to confirm the final terms of their settlement. Once that happens, the regulatory fog over XRP clears‚Äîand so does the path for institutions to enter through ETFs. In the meantime, traders are rotating into altcoins that could benefit from XRP‚Äôs momentum. Ethereum, Cardano, and Solana are all gaining volume, but newer names like MAGACOIN FINANCE are seeing a bigger surge in speculative interest due to their upside potential and low market caps. Conclusion: If Ripple lands its ETF approval, it could mark the beginning of a powerful altcoin season. Historical patterns show that ETF approvals don‚Äôt just boost the coin in question‚Äîthey lift the entire crypto ecosystem. For investors looking beyond the top 10, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a high-ROI investment , with analysts forecasting breakout-level gains should XRP spark the next rally.

49663787,549402,1754524822,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49663787.jpeg,Binance Former Leader Seeks Quick Exit From $1.8 Billion FTX Lawsuit,https://bitcoinist.com/binance-former-leader-seeks-quick-exit-from-1-8-billion-ftx-lawsuit/,"Former Binance CEO Changpeng ‚ÄúCZ‚Äù Zhao has moved to shake off a $1.76 billion clawback bid from the now-bankrupt FTX trust. It‚Äôs a bold opening move. Based on reports, he argues the case should never have landed in a Delaware court. Challenge To Delaware Jurisdiction According to a report , Zhao insists he lives in the United Arab Emirates and has no real ties to Delaware. He points out that the complaint doesn‚Äôt show he‚Äôs ‚Äúat home‚Äù there. His lawyers say the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware lacks power to decide this fight. If the judge agrees, FTX may have to find a new venue or refile elsewhere. Those jurisdiction rules matter when you‚Äôre chasing a humongous amount of money like $1.76 billion. FTX says the money flowed from a share purchase deal in 2021. Binance snapped up those shares just as FTX was heading toward insolvency. Zhao‚Äôs team calls that claim weak. They claim it falls outside US laws because the deal and his actions mostly took place overseas. Fight Over Fraud Claims Based on the motion filed on Monday, Zhao‚Äôs side also questions whether US fraud rules can stretch beyond America‚Äôs borders. He argues that the regulations at issue don‚Äôt apply to someone living in the UAE. Reports have disclosed that he challenged what lawyers call ‚Äúconstructive fraud‚Äù counts. Those counts hinge on federal definitions tied to securities contracts, Zhao‚Äôs filing says. FTX first sued Binance and Zhao back in November 2024. At that time, a Binance spokesperson blasted the effort as ‚Äúmeritless.‚Äù They said the trust was trying to shift blame for FTX‚Äôs collapse onto Binance and its founder. Binance already filed a similar motion to dismiss in May. That earlier paper noted FTX blamed Binance for ‚Äúpervasive malfeasance‚Äù by Sam Bankman-Fried. Weighing The Prior Motions That May motion raised many of the same points now front and center. It highlighted that FTX‚Äôs lawyers pointed to emails and wire transfers routed through US banks. Binance replied that those links aren‚Äôt enough. They argued simple financial messages don‚Äôt create a business ‚Äúpresence‚Äù in Delaware. Sam Bankman-Fried is serving a 25-year sentence for fraud and conspiracy. Whatever happens next, this fight over venue and jurisdiction will set the stage for a long legal battle over who pays for FTX‚Äôs losses. Zhao himself served four months in prison after pleading guilty to US anti-money laundering charges. The Pushback Meanwhile, FTX trust attorneys are expected to push back. They‚Äôll stress that billions of dollars moved through US accounts. They‚Äôll say those wires and phone calls establish jurisdiction under longstanding rules. The court‚Äôs decision on this procedural step could stretch on for months.

As X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram face mounting pressure for censorship, data harvesting, and algorithmic manipulation, blockchain-based alternatives are picking up serious traction. One of the major players in this new space is DeSoc , a new viral altcoin that‚Äôs about to revolutionize the way we socialize, converse, and make money online. While Solana has taken charge in rapid-speed blockchain adoption, experts now believe DeSoc may be up to par not in terms of TPS speed, but in revolutionizing the social aspect of Web3. Solana Dips as Investors Watch the Next Big Thing Solana is currently priced at $186, up 1% in the past 24 hours. Its market cap has a strong hold at $100 billion, with its trading volume up by 14.1% to $11.49 billion, a guarantee that there is action for SOL even during declines. Being one of the most scalable and fastest blockchains, Solana is well sought after for DeFi, NFTs, and meme coins. Even at its pace, however, Solana has failed to solve the social media equation. That‚Äôs where DeSoc is gaining traction, one that isn‚Äôt throughput-based, but trust, identity, and participation. DeSoc: Integrating Social Media, DeFi, and Digital Identity DeSoc is an emerging altcoin project that turns the Web3 experience on its head. Instead of simply storing data or swapping tokens, DeSoc enables individuals to build portable social identities usable in both dApps and blockchains. Here is how DeSoc is different: Decentralized reputation systems tied to wallet activity Interoperable social IDs you own not Big Tech Crypto-native social streams and voting systems Rewards engagement, not speculation Over $10M presale, with virality growing by the day This doesn‚Äôt just make DeSoc a sharing or messaging platform but a foundation layer for the future of digital society. Is DeSoc Able to Compete with Solana? Not in Speed, But in Influence Solana has no equal when it comes to performance metrics, with thousands of transactions per second and negligible gas fees. But while Solana focuses on infrastructure, DeSoc focuses on experience. Web2 social media is algorithm-driven and platform-controlled sites that moderate what people can see, monetize information, and pay advertisers rather than users. DeSoc flips this model on its head by putting users first, paying them, and making them cross-platform transportable. Crypto users no longer accept pumping tokens only. They want networks that give them something, influence, reputation, and community ownership. That‚Äôs DeSoc‚Äôs battlefield. And with meme coin holders, DeFi enthusiasts, and creators all searching for ways to participate and earn better, DeSoc can be among the few projects that can compete with Solana‚Äôs user growth, but from a different angle. Why DeSoc Is Gaining Attention Now Timing is everything in crypto, and DeSoc is riding a few waves: Need for decentralized identity Resistance to Big Tech censorship Cross-chain integration is becoming a requirement Utility in the real world drives altcoin adoption With a token that rewards users and builders, and a presale of over $10 million, DeSoc isn‚Äôt merely riding the social crypto wave; it‚Äôs leading it. Last Take: The Social Layer of Web3 Is Here Solana will remain a crypto behemoth of high-performance infrastructure. Infrastructure needs apps, users, and activity, and that is where DeSoc will thrive. As online communities grow, and identity is the new currency of trust, DeSoc is building perhaps the most impactful layer of Web3 to date. Whether you‚Äôre a creator, investor, or DeFi enthusiast, DeSoc offers a powerful new way to connect, earn, and belong in the crypto space.

Each is moving forward for different reasons. Cold Wallet has passed $5.8 million in its presale, showing potential for a 4,900% return from its current price to launch. Ethereum still leads in DeFi. Solana brings speed and rising volume, while Polkadot connects blockchains through modular tools. These projects range widely in price, from under $0.01 to above $3,622, but each offers something unique. Among them, Cold Wallet takes a different route by focusing on active users instead of future plans. That shift in approach makes it stand out among today‚Äôs top trending crypto to buy options. 1. Cold Wallet: Cashback Model Grows After $270M Deal Cold Wallet‚Äôs presale is now in Stage 16, with CWT priced at $0.00942. Over 645 million tokens are sold, and more than $5.8 million has already been raised. The token‚Äôs confirmed listing at $0.3517 points to a possible 4,900% gain. This growth follows the $270 million purchase of Plus Wallet, adding 2 million users and expanding reach in the self-custody wallet space. Cold Wallet ($CWT) stands out by offering cashback on everyday crypto use like gas, swaps, and transfers. There‚Äôs no staking or lockups involved. The system works within the wallet, providing simple rewards that give it an edge over wallets like MetaMask, which still face complaints about user flow and onboarding. Plus Wallet‚Äôs fast growth since early 2025 showed that ease of use matters. Now Cold Crypto Wallet plans to build on that, combining feedback into one stronger system across the two platforms. The ColdWallet.com domain was valued at only $2 million, which suggests the rest of the deal reflects product strength and real adoption. That level of working utility places Cold Wallet firmly among the top trending crypto to buy for those who value results over hype.. As presale momentum builds and more users migrate, Cold Wallet is shifting from a single app into a larger product ecosystem. 2. Ethereum‚Äôs Upgrades Keep It Strong in a Changing Market Ethereum is still a key part of the blockchain space, with its price near $3,622. As the top smart contract platform, it supports major DeFi apps, NFT sites, and enterprise tools. Backed by strong use and long-term support, Ethereum stays a leading option among the top trending crypto to buy. Its Dencun upgrade helped cut costs and improve network performance, which helps it stay ahead as Layer 2 platforms grow. The move to proof-of-stake has lowered energy use and added a burn system, which slowly reduces the token supply. Ethereum still faces challenges during times of high traffic, but its focus on rollups and Layer 2 solutions is helping to fix that. The network is working toward a more scalable future without losing its leading role. 3. Solana‚Äôs High-Speed Use Grows with Key Partnerships Solana, priced around $168.96, is seeing high demand from fast-moving apps. Its low fees and fast processing make it a top choice for games, NFTs, and memecoins. With more than 20 million daily transactions, its usage continues to grow. Connections with major names like Shopify and Visa give Solana extra weight in the space. The builder community is also active, with over 2,500 developers working on updates and tools. With its strong performance and growing set of features, Solana is often listed as a top trending crypto to buy for users who want speed and live interactions. While past outages raised concerns, recent improvements in network stability have helped rebuild trust in 2025. 4. Polkadot‚Äôs Design Connects Projects Across Blockchains Polkadot trades near $3.65 and is built to run many blockchains in parallel through parachains. This setup makes it great for projects that need speed and cross-chain links. It is becoming a go-to for builders looking for smooth connections between different networks. The developer base is growing, and many teams are testing on Polkadot or bidding in parachain auctions. Its tech is strong, and its focus on easy blockchain links supports its place as a top trending crypto to buy among infrastructure-first developers. Still, Polkadot‚Äôs name isn‚Äôt widely known outside of crypto circles. But new funding and fresh marketing in 2025 aim to fix that, giving the platform a chance to reach more users and builders. One Project Is Gaining the Lead as the Year Moves Forward Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot, and Cold Wallet all offer value in different ways. Ethereum has proven systems, Solana leads on speed, and Polkadot offers smooth chain-to-chain communication. But Cold Wallet is moving quickly. It has raised over $5.8 million in crypto presale 2025 , offers a 4,900% projected return, and completed a $270 million acquisition of Plus Wallet. This mix of momentum, users, and live features is making it stand out. As the end of 2025 gets closer, time to join early projects is running out. For those looking at the next top trending crypto to buy, Cold Wallet‚Äôs progress shows it may be ahead of the curve.

49663811,https://timestabloid.com/?p=77163,1754524856,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP‚Äôs Potential Price Target in a $20 Trillion Crypto Market Cap,https://timestabloid.com/xrps-potential-price-target-in-a-20-trillion-crypto-market-cap/,"As of now, the global cryptocurrency market is valued at approximately $3.7 trillion. XRP remains one of the few digital assets maintaining a substantial market share in this landscape. Currently, XRP holds around 4% of the total market capitalization, with a valuation of $123 billion. In comparison, other notable altcoins trail behind. Cardano represents just 0.63% of the market with a $20 billion capitalization, while Binance Coin (BNB) and Solana account for 2.78% and 2.29% respectively. The leading positions, however, continue to be held by Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the stablecoin USDT. Bitcoin dominates the market with a 64% share, valued at over $2 trillion. Ethereum holds 9%, and USDT represents approximately 5%. Forecasting XRP‚Äôs Potential in a $20 Trillion Market Analysts anticipate that the total value of the crypto market could exceed $20 trillion during the current bullish cycle. Some commentators, including popular voices like Capt Toblerone, have suggested the market could expand even further, to as much as $35 trillion. Assuming XRP maintains its current 4% market share in a $20 trillion crypto market, its capitalization would rise to $800 billion. With a circulating supply of approximately 58.93 billion tokens, this would place XRP at a price of around $13.57 per token. Such a price level would establish a new all-time high for XRP, which has remained below its historical peak for over seven years. Several analysts have predicted that XRP could reach or exceed $13 in this cycle, with some anticipating prices above $20 if adoption and demand continue to increase. Institutional Adoption May Influence Valuation Recent developments have introduced new factors that may support a higher valuation for XRP. Beyond traditional price modeling based on technical analysis and historical data, institutional interest in XRP has grown. The launch of XRP-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and its potential inclusion in corporate treasury strategies suggest that demand from institutional investors may significantly impact the asset‚Äôs price trajectory. If such developments persist, XRP could experience upward pressure beyond what market share analysis alone would predict. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Implications for Other Major Cryptocurrencies Applying the same model to other leading cryptocurrencies yields substantial growth projections. If Bitcoin retains its 64% dominance , its market capitalization in a $20 trillion market would rise to $12.8 trillion, translating to an estimated price of over $644,000 per BTC. Ethereum, maintaining its 9% share, would achieve a $1.8 trillion valuation, crossing the trillion-dollar threshold. Stablecoin USDT would rise to roughly $966 billion. Altcoins such as BNB and Solana would also experience significant gains, with market caps reaching $556 billion and $458 billion, respectively. Cardano, maintaining a 0.63% share, would see its valuation increase to approximately $126 billion. This would place ADA at a projected price of $3.56, approaching its previous all-time high of $3.10. XRP‚Äôs current market share positions it for substantial price growth if the broader cryptocurrency market reaches the projected $20 trillion mark. Provided XRP sustains its share and continues to benefit from institutional interest and ecosystem integration, a price exceeding $13 appears within reach under favorable conditions.

Three altcoins, DeSoc , Avalanche (AVAX), and Solana, are gaining serious traction for very different but equally powerful reasons. From user-owned social platforms to high-speed DeFi ecosystems, these projects are lighting up watchlists everywhere. Here‚Äôs why DeSoc, AVAX, and Solana stand out as explosive buys right now. Avalanche Attracts New Volume As It Eyes $30 Avalanche is steadily rebuilding momentum, positioning itself as one of the most explosive altcoins to watch right now. After a period of sideways movement and macro-driven dips, AVAX is now trading around $23.72, with analysts pointing to a possible breakout. Despite a minor pullback of 1.27% in the last 24 hours, the project holds strong with nearly $900 million in trading volume. Market analyst Ali Martinez highlighted $26 as the key resistance level if breached, Avalanche could trigger a swift rally toward $30 or even $35. Another analyst, CryptoShadow , sees this as part of a larger bullish continuation, not just a temporary spike. Avalanche‚Äôs technicals align with broader bullish sentiment across the market, with renewed buying pressure supporting the case for upside. As Bitcoin steadies and altcoins regain ground, AVAX is following with conviction. The ecosystem is showing signs of renewed activity, drawing attention from traders and long-term investors alike. Avalanche is no longer just recovering, it‚Äôs preparing for lift-off. Analysts Say Solana‚Äôs Chart Looks Ready For More Solana is gaining serious attention once again as it reclaims a strong position above the $200 level. After weeks of choppy trading and sideways movement, the token has broken through key resistance and is now setting up for what many analysts believe could be a major run. With daily volume soaring past $38 billion and its market cap holding steady at over $108 billion, Solana sits confidently in the top five. Analyst ZYN highlighted its breakout above $200 as a pivotal moment, calling the structure ‚Äúclean‚Äù with higher highs and higher lows. Another respected voice, Ali Martinez , pointed out that SOL recently broke out of an ascending triangle, often a signal of steep upside ahead. His next targets range from $300 to $360 if the momentum holds. Meanwhile, meaningful resistance doesn‚Äôt appear until the $260 mark, giving SOL room to run. If buyers remain active, this rally could only be getting started. Among the top altcoins right now, Solana is not just participating it‚Äôs leading. SOCS Token Unlocks A New Era Of Online Monetization DeSoc is quickly emerging as one of the most explosive altcoins to buy right now, not just for its tech, but for its mission. Built on blockchain, DeSoc is taking a direct shot at centralized social platforms by giving power back to users. It‚Äôs not just about content; it‚Äôs about ownership, monetization, and identity.

The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with recent reports of a truly significant event: a massive ETH whale accumulation . Over the past three days, a single entity has amassed an astounding amount of Ethereum, signaling a potentially bullish outlook for the popular altcoin. This kind of substantial Ethereum accumulation by a major player often captures the market‚Äôs attention, leading to widespread speculation about future price movements and market sentiment. What is This Gigantic ETH Whale Accumulation? Recent on-chain data, highlighted by crypto analyst @EmberCN on X, reveals that a prominent whale or institution, operating through a wallet created via BitGo, has made colossal moves in the Ethereum market. This entity has rapidly acquired a substantial volume of ETH, indicating strong conviction in Ethereum‚Äôs value proposition. Recent Inflow: In a span of just 20 hours, the wallet received 27,073 ETH, valued at approximately $97.62 million. This significant inflow immediately caught the eye of market observers. Total Accumulation: Over the last three days, the same entity has accumulated a staggering total of 128,204 ETH. This entire stash is worth around $464.5 million, marking one of the largest single crypto whale movements seen recently. These large-scale transactions were facilitated through several institutional-grade platforms, including FalconX, Galaxy Digital, and BitGo. The involvement of such platforms suggests that this is likely an institutional investor rather than an individual trader. Who is Behind This Institutional ETH Accumulation? While the exact identity of the ‚Äòwhale‚Äô remains anonymous, the use of platforms like BitGo, FalconX, and Galaxy Digital strongly points towards an institutional entity. These platforms are well-known for providing secure and compliant services to institutional clients, including hedge funds, asset managers, and corporations looking to engage with digital assets. BitGo, for instance, is a leading provider of digital asset financial services, specializing in security, custody, and liquidity. FalconX offers institutional prime brokerage services for digital assets, while Galaxy Digital is a diversified financial services and investment management company in the digital asset sector. Their involvement underscores the growing trend of institutional ETH adoption. Why Does This Ethereum Whale Activity Matter? The actions of a crypto whale , especially one engaging in such significant large ETH buys , often serve as a bellwether for market sentiment. When a major holder makes a substantial purchase, it can be interpreted in several ways: Strong Confidence: It suggests that the whale has high conviction in Ethereum‚Äôs long-term potential and believes the current price offers a favorable entry point. Market Influence: Such a large acquisition can influence market dynamics, potentially creating upward price pressure as demand increases. Institutional Interest: It highlights increasing institutional interest in Ethereum, which can bring more stability and legitimacy to the asset class. This level of Ethereum accumulation could signal a shift in market sentiment, potentially encouraging other investors to follow suit. It reflects a strategic long-term play, rather than short-term speculation. What Are the Implications of These Large ETH Buys? The implications of this significant ETH whale accumulation are multifaceted. Firstly, it adds considerable buying pressure to the Ethereum market. When a single entity purchases nearly half a billion dollars worth of ETH, it absorbs a substantial portion of available supply, which can naturally lead to price appreciation if sustained demand follows. Secondly, it reinforces the narrative of Ethereum as a prime asset for institutional portfolios. As more traditional financial players look to diversify into digital assets, Ethereum‚Äôs robust ecosystem, encompassing DeFi, NFTs, and a vast developer community, makes it an attractive option. This particular institutional ETH move could pave the way for more large-scale investments. Finally, it serves as a vote of confidence in Ethereum‚Äôs ongoing developments, such as scalability improvements and the transition to Ethereum 2.0 (now known as the Merge and subsequent upgrades). These technological advancements enhance Ethereum‚Äôs utility and appeal, making it a valuable asset for long-term holding. In conclusion, the recent ETH whale accumulation of $464.5 million in just three days is a powerful indicator of strong institutional conviction in Ethereum. This massive inflow of capital, facilitated by leading institutional platforms, underscores Ethereum‚Äôs growing appeal as a cornerstone digital asset. It hints at a potentially bullish future, as large players position themselves for what they believe will be significant long-term gains. This development truly makes waves in the crypto sea, offering a compelling narrative for Ethereum‚Äôs trajectory. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is an ETH whale? A: An ETH whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of Ethereum, enough to potentially influence its market price through their buying or selling activities. Q2: Why is this specific ETH accumulation significant? A: This accumulation is significant due to its sheer size ($464.5 million) and the short timeframe (3 days), indicating strong conviction and potentially institutional backing, which can signal broader market confidence. Q3: Who is BitGo and why are they mentioned? A: BitGo is a leading digital asset trust and security company that provides institutional-grade custody, trading, and finance solutions. Their involvement suggests that the whale is likely an institutional investor due to the high-security and compliance requirements for such large transactions. Q4: Does this large ETH accumulation guarantee a price increase for Ethereum? A: While a large accumulation often indicates bullish sentiment and can contribute to price appreciation, it does not guarantee a price increase. Cryptocurrency markets are complex and influenced by many factors, including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory news, and overall market sentiment. Q5: How can I track crypto whale movements? A: You can track crypto whale movements using on-chain analytics platforms and blockchain explorers that monitor large transactions and wallet activities. Many crypto news outlets and social media accounts also report on significant whale movements. Did you find this analysis of the recent ETH whale accumulation insightful?

With billions flowing into meme coin projects, the digital asset class, once considered a joke, is now commanding serious attention from traders, influencers, and early adopters. Meme coins have transformed from fringe experiments to top cryptos to join in 2025, offering a rare combination of relatability, market energy, and presale upside that traditional tokens struggle to match. While the buzz centers around familiar names, the real momentum lies in what‚Äôs emerging now. The rising class of meme coins, including MoonBull ($MOBU), Floki ($FLOKI), Brett ($BRETT), and Popcat ($POPCAT), is redefining early-stage opportunity. These tokens have layered tokenomics, communities with viral potential, and accessible price points that invite both new and seasoned crypto investors. 1. MoonBull ($MOBU) MoonBull ($MOBU) is built for Ethereum users and meme coin enthusiasts who are focused on high-velocity gains and smart contract reliability. This token is laser-focused on rewarding early-stage participants through an advanced staking system and mystery token drops. Its DeFi integration gives it structural depth, while its meme branding taps into the viral power of internet culture. MoonBull‚Äôs roadmap is intentionally guarded, revealing insights only to whitelist members. This design rewards those who engage early and adds a layer of exclusivity that intensifies demand. What also makes MoonBull compelling is its Ethereum foundation, which ensures secure, scalable infrastructure for DeFi and token interactions. Here‚Äôs what whitelist members will gain: Access at the lowest token price Unlock secret staking rewards Receive bonus token allocations Get private insights into the roadmap These perks won‚Äôt be shared publicly. Once the allocation fills, that‚Äôs it. No resets, no retries. MoonBull made it to this list of top cryptos to join in 2025 due to its intelligent mix of exclusivity, strong tokenomics, and presale architecture that supports rapid early-stage growth. Learn from Missed Chances: What Hesitation Can Cost Picture an investor scrolling through forums in 2013, dismissing Dogecoin as just another online joke. Or someone briefly considering Shiba Inu before its parabolic rise, only to move on without action. These moments become cautionary tales repeated in hindsight. MoonBull‚Äôs whitelist offers a chance to change that narrative. It represents a rare gateway to early-stage entry ‚Äì before the broader market awakens. While Stage One of the presale will eventually open to all, whitelist members receive private notice of the exact launch time and gain access before the public. The clock is ticking, and for those who understand that timing is everything, this may be the pivotal window that sets a portfolio apart. 2. Floki ($FLOKI) Floki ($FLOKI) gained its initial popularity due to its Elon Musk, but it has since matured into a robust ecosystem with utility and staying power. Its roadmap includes NFT gaming, metaverse expansion, and educational crypto platforms designed for new users. Built on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain, Floki has positioned itself as more than just a meme ‚Äì it‚Äôs a movement. Floki‚Äôs appeal lies in its trifecta approach: entertainment, education, and earning potential. The team has pushed hard into real-world use cases, with recent announcements around DeFi product integrations and community-driven philanthropic initiatives. Investors are drawn to Floki for its unique ability to balance humor and long-term strategy. It continues to build decentralized products, strengthening its case as one of the top cryptos to join in 2025. Floki earned its place on this list for blending meme culture with utility, delivering long-term vision and community leadership that attracts both new and experienced investors. 3. Brett ($BRETT) Brett ($BRETT) is a newcomer that leverages meme virality while integrating advanced token features for serious traders. What sets Brett apart is its dual-token economy and unique burn mechanics that support long-term price action. It thrives on cultural relevance, especially among Gen Z investors who resonate with its branding and storytelling. From limited NFT collections to gamified staking events, Brett is creating an ecosystem that is both fun and functional. The project‚Äôs team has consistently delivered on milestones, increasing confidence in its roadmap. The community behind Brett is rapidly expanding, thanks to creative airdrop campaigns and meme challenges that spread across TikTok and X. This gives it strong viral legs ‚Äì a critical feature for breakout meme coins. Brett is included among the top cryptos to join in 2025 due to its creative burn economy, dual-token design, and cultural magnetism that translates into real market momentum. 4. Popcat ($POPCAT) Popcat ($POPCAT) blends nostalgia and innovation. Inspired by a viral meme, it has evolved into a fully-fledged ecosystem complete with liquidity rewards, staking options, and gamified user interactions. Built on the Solana blockchain, Popcat offers speed, scalability, and very low transaction costs ‚Äì features that new users and day traders appreciate. One of Popcat‚Äôs biggest innovations is its meme-fueled GameFi engine. Users can earn rewards through mini-games, referrals, and content engagement. This model builds long-term user retention and continuous on-chain activity. In a time when attention spans are short and users seek quick ROI, Popcat provides both entertainment and income. Its branding is instantly recognizable, and its ecosystem is simple to navigate. Popcat secured its spot in this list of top cryptos to join in 2025 due to its GameFi integration, strong brand recall, and Solana-based performance that caters to active traders. Conclusion Based on the latest research, the top cryptos to join in 2025 include Moon Bull , Floki, Brett, and Popcat. Each of these projects brings a distinct blend of meme culture, smart tokenomics, and presale opportunity. However, MoonBull‚Äôs live whitelist access makes it the most time-sensitive opportunity among them. Whitelists remain a strategic way for investors to access new markets at rock-bottom prices before public trading drives up value. With MoonBull‚Äôs exclusive Stage One access and early staking rewards only available to whitelisted members, now is the time to act. The world is watching crypto adoption grow. Countries are adding Bitcoin to reserves, institutional players are entering meme territory, and early-stage tokens are offering unheard-of gains. This could be the tipping point for a new crypto wave, and MoonBull is leading the charge. For More Information: Website: https://www.moonbull.io/ Telegram: https://t.me/MoonBullCoin Twitter: https://x.com/MoonBullX FAQs What is the benefit of joining a crypto whitelist like MoonBull‚Äôs? Joining the whitelist gives users early access to tokens at the lowest possible price, plus exclusive rewards and insights that are not made public before launch. How do meme coins generate value beyond hype? Modern meme coins integrate DeFi utilities, staking, and community-based rewards, offering real value alongside viral branding.

Is it safe to join the MoonBull whitelist? MoonBull uses a secure whitelist form and Ethereum smart contracts, offering reliability and transparency for users.

Which Of These Is A Wiser Investment In 2025",https://thecoinrise.com/desoc-ripple-or-cardano-which-of-these-is-a-wiser-investment-in-2025/,"As the crypto market evolves, investors are looking beyond hype and into real-world value. Ripple, Cardano, and the rising star DeSoc each offer something different: payments, infrastructure, and decentralized social media. But which one holds the smartest potential for 2025? Whether you‚Äôre drawn to utility, long-term growth, or user-driven innovation, this breakdown explores which of these three could be the wisest investment this year. XRP Hits Resistance As Analysts Warn Of A Pullback XRP has delivered solid gains in July, jumping over 55% and continuing its five-year streak of closing the month in the green. But recent signals suggest that the momentum may be cooling. The token reached just below its all-time high of $3.80, only to form what analysts now call a double top, a classic sign of potential reversal. Crypto analyst Tradersboat pointed out that XRP has shown signs of buyer exhaustion, along with a Break of Structure, indicating bears may be gaining control. Resistance at $3.60 has held firm, with rejection from that level adding weight to the bearish case. While another short-term push to $3.70 remains possible, the larger setup points to a potential drop below $3.40. Historically, August has been one of XRP‚Äôs weakest months, with the past three years showing an average 12% dip after strong Julys. This pattern might repeat if sentiment shifts. While XRP has strong fundamentals, timing could be critical for new investors deciding between Ripple, Cardano, or a rising player like DeSoc. Cardano‚Äôs Price Weakens But Network Development Stays Strong Cardano is facing renewed pressure after a sharp 15% drop sent its price down to around $0.77. The fall broke through key support zones, triggering stop-losses and sparking concerns of a deeper slide. Investor sentiment has cooled as the SEC paused Bitwise‚Äôs multi-asset ETF, which included ADA. That move, though involving a small allocation, echoed broader regulatory uncertainty now hanging over altcoins. On-chain signals aren‚Äôt helping the case either daily active users have dropped below 40,000, and DeFi TVL has slipped to $382 million. The MACD has flipped negative, and the RSI still leaves room for further downside. If $0.73 doesn‚Äôt hold, some traders expect a test of $0.68 . Yet, beneath the bearish short-term setup, Cardano‚Äôs fundamentals remain quietly strong. The network is still expanding, with over 2,000 active projects, new smart contract upgrades, and Layer-2 innovations like Hydra progressing. It may not be the flashiest right now, but Cardano continues to build. In a long-term portfolio, that development focus could still count for a lot. Why DeSoc Offers More Than Just Social Media DeSoc is quickly standing out as one of the most forward-thinking crypto projects of 2025. Unlike Ripple and Cardano, which are focused on payments and infrastructure, DeSoc is tackling something far more personal: how we communicate, share, and connect online. At its center is the SOCS token, with which DeSoc enables individuals to get the most out of their content, their information, and their digital identity. No more algorithm black boxes. No more data exploitation. Users can publish across platforms like Facebook and Twitter while still owning everything they share. Governance isn‚Äôt reserved for insiders. SOCS holders have real voting power to shape how the platform evolves. Creators will be able to increase their availability, place targeted advertisements, and be rewarded for engaging. Under the hood, DeSoc has already locked team tokens for 2 years and liquidity for 30, which is an indicator of long-term stability. Regular audits and a clear token allocation model build even more trust. While Ripple and Cardano focus on systems, DeSoc focuses on people. If you‚Äôre looking for a crypto investment with real-world use, community power, and long-term growth potential, DeSoc might be the wisest bet in 2025.

This significant eight-point jump from the previous day indicates a notable shift in investor sentiment across the cryptocurrency landscape, moving from ‚ÄòNeutral‚Äô into the ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô zone. What does this heightened sense of optimism mean for your digital asset holdings? What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and Why Does it Matter? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, provided by the software development platform Alternative, serves as a thermometer for the cryptocurrency market‚Äôs emotional state. It ranges from 0 to 100, where 0 signifies extreme fear and 100 indicates extreme greed. This index helps investors understand whether the market is overly fearful (a potential buying opportunity) or overly greedy (a potential correction risk). Understanding this index is vital. When the index shows high market greed , it often suggests that prices might be overextended. Conversely, extreme fear can signal a bottoming out. This tool provides a unique perspective on the collective psyche of crypto participants. Decoding the Shift: From Neutral to Market Greed As of August 7, the index stands at 62, firmly placing the market in the ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô category. This rise from the ‚ÄòNeutral‚Äô zone suggests that optimism is growing, and more participants are feeling bullish about crypto assets. This shift can be a double-edged sword for investors. While increased optimism can fuel further price appreciation, it also carries risks. High levels of market greed often precede market corrections as investors become less cautious. It is essential to remember that sentiment can change quickly, influencing price volatility. How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? The index considers six different factors to arrive at its score, providing a comprehensive view of crypto market sentiment : Volatility (25%): Measures current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Compares current volume and market momentum with average values. Social Media (15%): Analyzes keywords on various social media platforms. Surveys (15%): Polls investors to gauge their sentiment (currently paused). Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Assesses Bitcoin‚Äôs share of the total crypto market cap. Google Trends (10%): Looks at search queries related to Bitcoin. These components collectively paint a picture of prevailing investor sentiment , helping to identify potential market tops or bottoms based on emotional extremes. Understanding Bitcoin Dominance and Its Role Bitcoin dominance is a key factor in the index. It measures Bitcoin‚Äôs market capitalization relative to the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. A rising Bitcoin dominance can indicate that investors are moving towards the perceived safety of Bitcoin, potentially pulling liquidity from altcoins. Conversely, falling dominance might suggest an ‚Äòaltcoin season‚Äô where capital flows into other digital assets. The index uses this metric because Bitcoin often leads the market. Its dominance can signal broader trends and shifts in crypto market sentiment , affecting the overall fear or greed levels across the entire ecosystem. Navigating the Greed Zone: Actionable Insights for Investors When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index shows significant market greed , what should investors consider? This is a time for careful planning rather than impulsive decisions. While the rising sentiment can be exciting, seasoned investors often use periods of extreme greed as a signal to exercise caution. Here are some actionable insights: Review Your Portfolio: Consider rebalancing or taking some profits, especially from highly appreciated assets. Avoid FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out): Do not let the rising sentiment push you into hasty purchases at potentially inflated prices. Conduct Due Diligence: Always research thoroughly before investing, regardless of market sentiment. Set Stop-Loss Orders: Protect your investments from sudden downturns if the sentiment shifts rapidly. Remember, the index is a sentiment indicator, not a definitive buy or sell signal. It serves as a valuable tool to understand the prevailing emotions that drive market behavior. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index reaching 62 and entering the ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô zone highlights a significant shift in the market‚Äôs emotional landscape. While this reflects growing optimism and potentially upward price momentum, it also signals a time for prudence. By understanding the factors that influence this index and exercising disciplined investment strategies, you can better navigate the evolving crypto market sentiment and make informed decisions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does a score of 62 mean on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? A score of 62 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index means the market has entered the ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô zone. This indicates that investors are feeling optimistic and bullish, potentially leading to increased buying activity and higher prices. What factors influence the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The index considers six factors: volatility (25%), market momentum/volume (25%), social media activity (15%), surveys (15% ‚Äì currently paused), Bitcoin dominance (10%), and Google Trends data (10%). Is high greed good for the crypto market? While high greed can signal strong upward momentum, it can also indicate that the market might be overheated. Historically, periods of extreme greed are often followed by market corrections, making it a time for investors to exercise caution. How does Bitcoin dominance affect the index? Bitcoin dominance, which measures Bitcoin‚Äôs market share, is a key factor. A rising dominance can suggest investors are consolidating into Bitcoin, while a falling dominance might indicate a shift of capital into altcoins, both influencing overall market sentiment. Should I invest when the index shows ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô? The index is a sentiment tool, not an investment advisor. While ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô indicates optimism, it‚Äôs wise to be cautious. Consider rebalancing your portfolio, taking profits, and avoiding impulsive decisions driven by FOMO. Always conduct your own research.

Despite past rallies, retail sell-offs, weak technicals, and heavy whale dominance are holding DOGE back. Meanwhile, a new viral altcoin is rewriting the script, soaring 400% in just days. As investors chase real innovation and growth, Dogecoin may struggle to keep up in this new market cycle. Dogecoin Slides Again As Whales Keep Buying And Retail Keeps Selling Dogecoin is once again losing steam, dropping over 4% after last week‚Äôs brief 37% rally. The excitement that pushed DOGE higher has faded fast, and retail sentiment remains firmly on the sidelines. While whales continue to accumulate, with over 122 billion DOGE now in their hands, smaller holders are still offloading. Retail selling has persisted since early July, and new participants haven‚Äôt replaced the exit. This imbalance is weighing heavily on the price. Market data from Coinglass confirms the trend: trading volume is down nearly 47%, and open interest has dropped to $4.85 billion. Technicals paint a grim picture, too. DOGE trades below all major moving averages, including the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day, each reinforcing downward pressure. The MACD is deep in the red, and any small rally attempts are quickly overwhelmed by larger selloffs. Despite heavy whale support, DOGE continues to struggle with strong resistance levels and a lack of new retail enthusiasm. Analysts now question whether Dogecoin can ever realistically approach $1. It‚Äôs not just about memes anymore; market structure and momentum say otherwise. Without fresh retail demand and under consistent resistance, DOGE‚Äôs path to $1 is becoming harder to imagine. Meanwhile, a new altcoin is stealing the spotlight with a 400% surge, raising fresh questions about where retail energy is heading next. DeSoc Could Be The Viral Altcoin That DOGE Never Became While Dogecoin struggles to find upward momentum, a new altcoin is quietly building massive traction. DeSoc (SOCS) is capturing attention with its decentralized approach to social media, something traditional platforms have failed to deliver. A 2023 study found that 64% of Americans believe social media companies control the news too much. DeSoc takes this seriously, using blockchain to return control to users and protect their data. It‚Äôs not about memes or hype; it‚Äôs about transparency, fairness, and real utility. The team behind DeSoc has locked their tokens for two years and secured a 30-year liquidity lock, moves that signal a serious long-term vision and market stability. Unlike projects that focus solely on price action, DeSoc backs its mission with multiple security audits, with one already completed and more scheduled. This shows clear dedication to protecting investors and users alike. Its user-friendly design features customizable profiles, integrated wallets, and AI-powered content recommendations, all while safeguarding privacy. However, unlike Dogecoin, which has no real utility, DeSoc has a real-life use case. It is a platform where user ownership, the safety of data, and free speech are the primary concerns. With token distribution fully transparent and early access already generating buzz, DeSoc is shaping up to be the altcoin that doesn‚Äôt just ride a wave it builds one.

Meme coins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and PEPE are once again in focus‚Äîbut investors are starting to reassess where the real upside lies. In the midst of this shift, MAGACOIN FINANCE has caught the attention of high-level crypto traders, with some whales positioning early for what they believe could be a major 31x breakout. Meme Coins Are Back ‚Äì but for How Long? Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading around $0.00001220, while PEPE sits slightly lower at $0.00001046. Despite strong communities, both are struggling to regain momentum seen during previous bull runs. Dogecoin (DOGE), the original meme coin, is holding near $0.2044 but has shown signs of slowing down after a recent rally sparked by broader crypto gains. Many investors are now looking for fresh momentum plays‚Äîprojects that combine meme culture with real tokenomics, scalability, and long-term development. That‚Äôs where emerging altcoins are stepping into the spotlight. Why This Hidden Gem Is Drawing Whale Interest With capital flowing out of stagnant meme coins, MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming the go-to pick for investors looking ahead. Unlike projects stuck in hype cycles, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building an ecosystem that rewards early holders, offers deflationary mechanics, and has a clear roadmap backed by strong community engagement. Analysts are watching closely as whales enter during this early window, forecasting potentia l gains of 31x or more as retail demand begins to build. $500 invested now could realistically turn into $15,500 , according to current price projections‚Äîassuming similar momentum to other early-stage altcoin breakouts. What Comes Next for SHIB, PEPE, and DOGE? Shiba Inu‚Äôs ecosystem developments‚Äîincluding Shibarium‚Äîhaven‚Äôt yet moved the price significantly. PEPE remains highly volatile and speculative, with limited upside unless volume spikes drastically. Meanwhile, DOGE benefits from its name recognition, but many believe its days of 100x moves are behind it. That‚Äôs why investors are rotating into new territory, seeking smaller caps with bigger upside potential. Conclusion Altcoin season is in full swing, but the rules have changed. Traders aren‚Äôt just chasing hype‚Äîthey‚Äôre looking for what‚Äôs next. While SHIB, PEPE, and DOGE still hold nostalgia value, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are commanding attention for their growth potential and strategic entry points. With whales now circling and early backers projecting 31x gains , this could be the golden opportunity of the summer.

The cryptocurrency world is always in motion, and understanding its shifts is key to navigating its often-volatile waters. Recently, a significant indicator, the Altcoin Season Index , has captured the attention of many. This crucial metric, tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), recently registered a value of 36. This figure, down from previous days, signals a clear shift: the crypto market is currently experiencing what is known as Bitcoin Season . What Does the Altcoin Season Index Really Tell Us? The Altcoin Season Index is more than just a number; it is a snapshot of the broader cryptocurrency landscape. It helps investors understand whether altcoins (any cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin) are outperforming Bitcoin or vice versa. This index, which carefully excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens, compares the 90-day performance of the top 100 coins listed on CMC against Bitcoin. An index score ranging from 1 to 100. Altcoin Season : Occurs when at least 75% of the top 100 altcoins outperform Bitcoin over the past 90 days. Bitcoin Season : Indicated when 25% or fewer of these altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin. With the index now at 36, it strongly suggests that Bitcoin has been the dominant performer, leading the current market trends . Why Are We Seeing Bitcoin Season Now? The shift to Bitcoin Season is a natural part of the cryptocurrency cycle. Bitcoin often acts as a bellwether for the entire crypto market . When uncertainty rises or institutional interest focuses on established assets, capital tends to flow back into Bitcoin. This strengthens its position relative to altcoins. Several factors can contribute to this phenomenon: Market Stability Seeking : Investors often view Bitcoin as a safer haven during periods of high volatility or macroeconomic concerns. Dominance Cycle : Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements frequently dictate the overall direction of the market, influencing altcoin performance . Liquidity Concentration : Larger capital inflows often target Bitcoin first due to its superior liquidity and market capitalization. This dynamic often means that even if altcoins are seeing some gains, Bitcoin‚Äôs gains are comparatively larger, leading to a lower Altcoin Season Index . Navigating the Current Crypto Market: What Does This Mean for Your Portfolio? Understanding that we are in Bitcoin Season can help investors adjust their strategies. It is not necessarily a negative signal, but rather an indication of where current capital flows are concentrated. For many, this period might present different opportunities and challenges. Consider these actionable insights: Focus on Bitcoin : If your portfolio is heavily diversified into altcoins, this might be a time to re-evaluate your Bitcoin exposure. Strategic Altcoin Positioning : For those holding altcoins, research projects with strong fundamentals that might weather the Bitcoin Season better or be poised for future growth when the cycle shifts. Risk Management : Periods of Bitcoin dominance can sometimes precede broader market corrections for altcoins, making risk management even more crucial. Monitoring the Altcoin Season Index allows you to make informed decisions based on prevailing market trends . Looking Ahead: Will Altcoin Performance Rebound? The cryptocurrency market is cyclical, and periods of Bitcoin Season eventually give way to Altcoin Season , and vice-versa. While the current Altcoin Season Index suggests Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance, this does not mean altcoins are irrelevant. Historically, altcoins have shown incredible resilience and potential for significant gains once market sentiment shifts or specific narratives emerge. Factors that could signal a return to strong altcoin performance include: Sustained Bitcoin price stability or consolidation. Breakthroughs in specific altcoin projects or ecosystems (e.g., Layer 2 solutions, DeFi innovations). Increased retail investor interest spreading beyond Bitcoin. Keeping an eye on these broader market trends and technological advancements within the altcoin space is essential for long-term success. In conclusion, the Altcoin Season Index at 36 clearly indicates that the crypto market is currently in Bitcoin Season . This phase highlights Bitcoin‚Äôs current strength and influences altcoin performance . While it calls for a strategic approach to your portfolio, remember that market cycles are dynamic. Staying informed about these crucial market trends and understanding what drives them will empower you to make more confident decisions in the ever-evolving world of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index is a metric from CoinMarketCap that tracks whether altcoins (cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin) are outperforming Bitcoin over a 90-day period. It ranges from 1 to 100. Q2: How is Altcoin Season determined? Altcoin Season occurs when at least 75% of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. Q3: What does it mean to be in Bitcoin Season? Bitcoin Season means that Bitcoin has been the dominant performer. This happens when 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days, as indicated by the Altcoin Season Index. Q4: How does Bitcoin Season impact altcoin performance? During Bitcoin Season, altcoins generally see less significant gains compared to Bitcoin, or they may even decline in value relative to Bitcoin. Capital tends to flow more towards Bitcoin as investors seek stability or leadership from the largest cryptocurrency. Q5: Is Bitcoin Season a bad thing for crypto investors? Not necessarily. Bitcoin Season is a normal part of the crypto market cycle. It suggests where the current market strength lies. For investors, it can be a time to consolidate positions, re-evaluate risk, and strategically plan for future shifts back to altcoin dominance. Did you find this analysis helpful?

Market data from CoinGecko shows the total crypto market capitalization currently stands at approximately $3.79 trillion, representing a 0.4% decline in the last 24 hours. This pullback follows a period of uncertainty across major digital assets, with both Bitcoin and altcoins facing limited buying momentum despite periods of volatility. Analysts suggest that reduced market activity and fluctuations in leveraged trading positions are playing a significant role in current market behavior. Insights from Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges globally, highlight shifting trader sentiment as leverage levels decline while overall price movement remains subdued. These changes raise questions about whether the market is entering a phase of consolidation or setting up for more volatility ahead. Related Reading: Bitcoin Inflows To Binance Accelerate: Investor Behavior Shifts After Months Of Decline Leverage Trends on Binance Point to Market Reset According to a recent analysis from CryptoQuant contributor Arab Chain, leverage usage on Binance has decreased notably in recent days. The analyst explains that falling leverage is typically a short-term positive indicator as it suggests the exit of overleveraged traders and a reduction in forced liquidations. This can help stabilize price fluctuations and reduce abrupt sell-offs that often trigger sharp market corrections. However, Arab Chain points out that the current scenario differs slightly. Both price levels and leverage ratios have declined simultaneously, indicating that spot market buying has not picked up to offset selling activity. ‚ÄúThe lack of strong demand in the spot market weakens the probability of a rapid recovery,‚Äù the analyst wrote. This trend highlights a more cautious approach from traders, potentially reflecting macroeconomic uncertainties or a wait-and-see attitude ahead of key market developments. The estimated leverage ratio on Binance is considered a critical indicator for short-term sentiment. A high leverage ratio suggests speculative positions are dominating the market, making it more vulnerable to sudden price swings. Conversely, a falling ratio can indicate risk management among traders or widespread liquidations, both of which can temporarily ease volatility. Arab Chain emphasizes that this metric acts as an ‚Äúearly radar‚Äù for potential shifts in market momentum. Altcoin Deposits Signal Increased Trading Activity In a separate analysis, CryptoQuant‚Äôs Maartunn observed a significant increase in altcoin deposits to Binance, with a seven-day transaction count exceeding 45,000, the highest level since late 2024. This surge in activity coincided with Bitcoin‚Äôs recent push above $112,000, suggesting traders are preparing to adjust their positions across a wider range of digital assets. Deposits to exchanges are often interpreted as a signal of upcoming trading activity, as funds are moved from wallets to platforms where they can be quickly exchanged. Whether this results in increased buying or selling depends on how the broader market evolves in the coming days. The uptick in deposits could indicate growing interest in altcoins as traders look for opportunities beyond Bitcoin amid its recent stagnation.

A major player in the asset management space, Trivest Advisors, has made a substantial commitment to the digital asset market. This Hong Kong-based firm, which oversees an impressive $1.2 billion in assets, recently revealed a massive $90.4 million investment in BlackRock‚Äôs spot Bitcoin ETF, known by its ticker IBIT. This isn‚Äôt just a large sum; it‚Äôs a clear signal of growing confidence from established financial institutions in the world of digital assets. Such a significant move by Trivest Advisors underscores the increasing mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin and its associated investment vehicles, particularly the highly anticipated BlackRock Bitcoin ETF . A Pivotal Institutional Bitcoin Investment by Trivest Advisors This investment by Trivest Advisors isn‚Äôt just about the dollar amount; it signifies a strategic move. Their $90.4 million stake in BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT likely places them among the top 10 holders of the fund globally. This is a monumental step for institutional Bitcoin investment , as it demonstrates how traditional asset managers are actively integrating digital assets into their portfolios. Such a substantial commitment from a firm managing over a billion dollars sends a powerful message. It validates Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class for large-scale financial entities. This move could also inspire other hesitant institutional investors to consider similar allocations to spot Bitcoin ETFs. The Expanding Landscape of Spot Bitcoin ETF Adoption The launch of spot Bitcoin ETF products in the United States has truly transformed the cryptocurrency investment landscape. These funds offer a regulated and accessible pathway for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements without directly holding the cryptocurrency. Trivest Advisors‚Äô move highlights the accelerating trend of widespread spot Bitcoin ETF adoption. This surge in institutional interest reflects a growing understanding of Bitcoin‚Äôs potential. It also showcases the effectiveness of these ETF products in bridging the gap between traditional finance and the innovative world of digital currencies. The ease of access and regulatory oversight provided by these ETFs are key drivers behind this institutional influx. What Does This Mean for Crypto ETF Investment? Trivest Advisors‚Äô significant stake has broader implications for the entire crypto ETF investment sector. It indicates a maturing market where sophisticated investors are actively seeking exposure to digital assets through regulated products. This could lead to: Increased Liquidity: More institutional money flowing into ETFs generally enhances market liquidity. Price Stability: Greater institutional participation can contribute to more stable price discovery for Bitcoin. Broader Acceptance: Such investments pave the way for wider acceptance of cryptocurrencies in mainstream finance. While the benefits are clear, it‚Äôs also important to acknowledge that any crypto ETF investment still carries inherent market volatility. Investors should always conduct thorough research and understand the risks involved. Analyzing the Top Bitcoin ETF Holders The news about Trivest Advisors‚Äô investment naturally prompts questions about the current landscape of Bitcoin ETF holders . While exact real-time rankings can fluctuate, a $90.4 million stake positions Trivest Advisors as a significant player. This investment places them alongside other notable entities that have recognized the long-term value proposition of Bitcoin through the ETF structure.

49665982,549381,1754528416,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49665982.jpeg,Base Explains Network Disruption: Sequencer Glitch Led To 33-Minute Block Production Halt,https://bitcoinist.com/base-explains-network-disruption-33-minute-halt/,"Base, the Ethereum Layer-2 solution developed by Coinbase, experienced a 33-minute network disruption that halted block production on its Mainnet. The outage occurred on August 5, 2025, and was caused by unexpected on-chain congestion combined with an unprepared backup sequencer. While Base is designed with high availability in mind‚Äîfeaturing multiple sequencer instances managed by Conductor (an OP Stack component)‚Äîa critical handoff failure required manual intervention to resume operations. This event sparked immediate fear and speculation across the crypto community. Investors and users began to question the sustainability of the network, especially as Layer-2 scaling solutions are expected to offer seamless, reliable performance. The incident highlighted potential vulnerabilities in the sequencer infrastructure, casting doubt on whether Base can maintain uptime and stability during periods of high demand. As trust in the network was momentarily shaken, critics pointed to the risks of centralized sequencer management, while supporters emphasized that the quick response prevented a longer disruption. Nonetheless, the reputational impact has raised concerns for both institutional users and DeFi projects considering the network for deployment. The coming weeks will be critical as they address these concerns and work to restore confidence in the network. Base Outlines Root Cause And Fixes Network Outage Following the recent 33-minute network disruption, Base published a detailed postmortem report explaining the technical root cause and the mitigation steps taken to restore the network. The issue stemmed from a sequencer handoff failure within the system‚Äôs High Availability (HA) cluster, which is managed by Conductor, an OP Stack component designed to maintain uptime and minimize single points of failure. At 6:07am UTC, the active sequencer started lagging behind due to intense on-chain activity. Conductor, functioning as intended, initiated an automated handoff to a new sequencer. However, the new sequencer was still being provisioned and wasn‚Äôt yet ready to produce blocks. Typically, if a newly elected sequencer is unhealthy, Conductor would perform another handoff. Unfortunately, since Conductor wasn‚Äôt fully operational on this sequencer, it couldn‚Äôt initiate another transfer. By 6:09am UTC, monitoring systems flagged the issue, and the Base team was paged. At 6:12am UTC, the incident was officially declared. To mitigate the issue, Base engineers paused Conductor‚Äôs HA software to stop further faulty leadership transfers and manually elected a healthy sequencer. By 6:40am UTC, the network had resumed normal operations. To prevent future incidents, Base is working on updating its infrastructure to ensure that any sequencer added to the cluster is always capable of leadership transfer if elected. Additionally, the team is enhancing testing protocols to validate these fixes before deployment. These measures are aimed at bolstering Base‚Äôs system robustness and avoiding similar disruptions in the future. Ethereum Price Action Reflects Market Caution Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $3,611.52 after experiencing a sharp decline from its recent local high of $3,940. The price is struggling to regain bullish momentum, failing to hold above the $3,700 resistance zone. This chart shows that ETH has entered a consolidation phase after its aggressive rally from $2,852.16, which remains a key support level in case of further downside. The 50-day moving average (blue line) is acting as dynamic resistance around the $3,640 zone, while the 100-day (green line) and 200-day (red line) moving averages are still positioned below the price, reflecting a broader bullish trend. However, the recent rejection near the $3,860.80 level indicates that bulls are losing control in the short term. While Base itself doesn‚Äôt have a native token, its performance is closely tied to Ethereum‚Äôs Layer-2 ecosystem narrative. Investors are now watching closely to see if ETH can stabilize above $3,600, as any further weakness could amplify doubts about the broader L2 market.

Three names are making the loudest noise, Spartans.com, Stake.com, and Betway. Each follows a different plan. Stake builds buzz with ongoing prize pools, Betway offers steady seasonal free bet deals, and Spartans turns all the spotlight on a single grand prize, a Lamborghini, for one winner. For those chasing life-changing wins, the question is not only who offers the biggest prize, but also who offers the clearest way to get it. Here‚Äôs how these three heavyweights compare when ambition, clarity, and player experience go head-to-head. Spartans: Single-Prize Lamborghini Giveaway Grabs Big Attention Spartans has focused all its promotional effort on one major goal, awarding a Lamborghini to a single winner in a live-streamed finale. Unlike quiet prize draws or rotating offers, Spartans makes the entire process public and competitive. Entry is simple: sign up, deposit crypto, and opt into the Lamborghini Challenge. There are no complex missions or unclear rules. This direct style makes Spartans stand out in 2025‚Äôs big prize scene as one of the most confident operators. The pull is powerful. One grand prize creates more excitement than many smaller, hidden rewards. Every deposit feels like a step toward the spotlight. Both casual players and high-stakes users instantly understand the stakes and can‚Äôt ignore the outcome. In 2025, this is a clear example of a crypto giveaway designed to thrill rather than just keep people engaged. With instant withdrawals after the win, Spartans also sets a higher standard for trust and transparency, giving the campaign both credibility and maximum player impact. Stake.com: Constant Prizes Over One Big Spotlight Stake.com builds its giveaways around non-stop action. Players see weekly $50,000 raffles, leaderboard races, and rotating prize pools. The aim is simple, keep the activity flowing with plenty of chances to win. It‚Äôs a perfect fit for regular players who enjoy tracking many promos. Stake also fuels engagement through community live streams and influencer tie-ins. Still, while the total prize value is huge, the focus gets blurred. Rewards are shared among thousands or replaced so quickly that no single event stands out. For some, this means more chances. For others, it means less thrill. Against Spartans‚Äô single Lamborghini spotlight, Stake‚Äôs rewards lean more on loyalty than emotion. Strong in numbers, but lighter in lasting impact. Betway: Steady and Safe Rewards Betway takes a more traditional route, seasonal giveaways, boosted odds, and free bet draws. While not fully crypto-focused, some areas now allow digital currency play. Joining is easy: place a bet, earn an entry, and you could win credits, merchandise, or small cash amounts. This works for players who want stability over spectacle. But in a year when crypto gambling promos are getting bolder and more public, Betway‚Äôs approach feels careful. The prizes rarely hit the size that sparks major excitement, and the process blends in with the sportsbook‚Äôs regular flow. For those wanting easy bonuses, it‚Äôs fine. But compared to a Lamborghini or weekly six-figure pools, Betway‚Äôs style comes across as safe, but forgettable. Wrap Up The key difference in this contest is intent. Spartans is built to be remembered. The Lamborghini Challenge rewards and impresses in equal measure. It‚Äôs public, final, and impossible to mix up with a normal promo. Stake spreads its big rewards across too many winners to create one unforgettable moment. Betway stays in its comfort zone instead of pushing limits. Spartans wins not just on the size of the prize but on how it‚Äôs delivered, clear entry, tangible reward, and a finale set for all to see. This rare mix of openness and excitement makes it stand out among big prize sites. For players choosing where to play, Spartans tells the simplest story: no missions, no point systems, no tiers. Just one question, do you want the car? And for many, that clarity beats the noise of endless promos.

49666712,https://thecoinrise.com/cold-wallet-stuns-crypto-market-with-270m-deal-and-2m-users-pre-launch/,1754528437,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/49666712.jpeg,Cold Wallet Stuns Crypto Market With $270M Deal and 2M Users Pre-Launch!,https://thecoinrise.com/cold-wallet-stuns-crypto-market-with-270m-deal-and-2m-users-pre-launch/,"Crypto presales in 2025 are gaining momentum, but many are offering unfinished projects, lacking products, user bases, or any proof of delivery. Cold Wallet is the clear exception. It recently finalized a $270 million purchase, securing active infrastructure and a user base of more than 2 million, all before its official launch. This isn‚Äôt just a pitch on paper. Cold Wallet (CWT) is already functioning with tested systems and a built-in real-time cashback mechanism. It‚Äôs not preparing to look legitimate later. It‚Äôs already doing what others promise. In a market filled with vague blueprints, Cold Wallet stands out as one of the rare 2025 crypto presales showing actual results. A Bold $270M Acquisition That Changes the Game Where most presale projects are still seeking attention and building from the ground up, Cold Wallet made a strategic move with a $270 million acquisition. This deal brought the well-established Plus Wallet under its ownership, along with over 2 million active users. It wasn‚Äôt a marketing gimmick or token trade; it was a real purchase that redefined Cold Wallet‚Äôs standing. It‚Äôs not a small concept hoping to grow, it‚Äôs already equipped with the tools, tech, and user traction. For anyone reviewing crypto presales 2025, Cold Wallet isn‚Äôt forecasting what it might become; it‚Äôs building it already. Two Million Users Integrated Instantly With the Plus Wallet takeover, Cold Wallet didn‚Äôt just obtain software. It gained people. Over 2 million functioning wallets are now part of its system, with no long onboarding or transition delays. This scale of verified user migration is nearly unmatched among presales. While others rely on giveaways and referral campaigns, Cold Wallet now launches with one of the strongest user bases in the space. Each of these users adds power to the Cold Wallet ecosystem‚Äôs usage, demand, and pace. CWT isn‚Äôt merely a presale token; it powers an ecosystem that‚Äôs already running. Built on Working Systems, Not Empty Promises Cold Wallet also inherited a full-fledged operational backend and user interface through the acquisition. This matters. It allows Cold Wallet to release features quickly and without delays or broken promises. Core functions like wallet setup, gas tracking, fiat on-ramps, and multi-chain swaps aren‚Äôt goals; they‚Äôre already active features, thanks to the structure taken from Plus Wallet. Macro view of a screen of trading terminal with abstract financial graph and digits. Trading and forex concept. 3D Rendering Instead of starting at zero, Cold Wallet is accelerating a platform that already functions efficiently. Real Cashback That Rewards Activity Cold Wallet‚Äôs reward system isn‚Äôt an add-on. It‚Äôs central to the product. Users earn automatic cashback in CWT for performing tasks like swapping, transferring, or paying for gas. There are no complicated steps, staking requirements, or interfaces to navigate. The more CWT held, the higher the cashback tier, ranging from 10% up to 100%. This model directly connects platform usage to token demand. With millions of users arriving, that structure becomes even more valuable. Referral Program With Immediate Payouts Cold Wallet‚Äôs referral structure is designed to reward users upfront. Referrers earn USDT immediately, along with bonus CWT coins during the ongoing presale phase. There‚Äôs no post-launch delay or empty promises. It‚Äôs real-time value shared with those helping grow the network. This transforms Cold Wallet into a network-growing tool. Each referral not only boosts numbers but also enhances token circulation and reach. Cold Wallet‚Äôs Presale Numbers Surge Cold Wallet‚Äôs presale is still early, yet the progress is massive. The price in Stage 16 is set at $0.00942, while the listing price is projected at $0.3517. This indicates a gain potential of over 4,900%. So far, over 685 million CWT have been sold and the presale has brought in more than $5.7 million. This isn‚Äôt a case of searching for traction. Cold Wallet already has momentum and still offers entry at favorable terms. Why Cold Wallet Leads Among Crypto Presales 2025 Rather than making claims about future developments, Cold Wallet has already achieved key milestones. From securing a $270M platform and integrating 2 million users, to activating live systems and distributing real cashback, everything is already in motion. The referral rewards are live. The wallet features are deployed. The tech works and scales. There are no missing parts, only continued progress. Among all crypto presales 2025 , few are showing this level of readiness. Cold Wallet stands apart with real infrastructure, a solid user base, and a clear model linking utility to value. And with early presale stages still active, the entry point remains attractive for those following tangible success.

That‚Äôs why traders are zooming in on four high-upside contenders. This roundup highlights the top altcoin to watch right now, BlockDAG, Hyperliquid, Sui, and Binance Coin (BNB), each showing unique strength, big momentum, and solid structures behind the price action. BlockDAG is exploding with its $364M presale and tech-first ecosystem. Hyperliquid is proving structure matters, even at a premium. Sui thrives on volatility with a technical edge. And BNB? It‚Äôs holding strong with real-world adoption and institutional eyes watching. Whether you‚Äôre in it for quick flips or long-term gains, these four deserve a closer look. 1. BlockDAG: The Presale Powerhouse Turning Heads in Every Cycle When it comes to presales, few are making waves like BlockDAG (BDAG) . This project blends DAG architecture with Layer 1 scalability, setting it up to handle high volumes without the lag of older blockchains. That‚Äôs exactly why traders are flocking in, and why BlockDAG is the top altcoin to watch this season. The numbers are loud: $364 million raised, 24.8 billion BDAG coins sold, over 18,900 miners gone, and $7.7 million in hardware revenue. BDAG is priced at $0.0016 right now, while its listing is locked at $0.05. That‚Äôs a staggering 3,025% return sitting in plain sight. The 10 BTC Auction adds more fuel, every buyer gets a shot at winning Bitcoin. With this bonus and the price window closing by August 11, the energy around BDAG is real. Traders know it: this is one of the biggest shots to get in before liftoff. 2. Sui: Volatility-Driven & Timing-Obsessed Sui lives for volatility, and traders love it. Built with the Move programming language, it‚Äôs designed to give more control over digital ownership and speed. That draws in users who want performance without compromise. SUI reacts fast to market shifts, making it a prime target for tactical trades. Right now, it‚Äôs hovering at levels traders are eyeing for potential reentry. For anyone scanning for the top altcoin to watch during uncertain conditions, Sui delivers precision opportunities. It‚Äôs less about hype, more about execution, and the payoff can be real if the entry is right. 3. Hyperliquid: High Price, Strong Structure, Still on Radar Hyperliquid isn‚Äôt cheap, but it‚Äôs not backing down either. While many sit on the sidelines hoping for a dip, HYPE continues to show it‚Äôs built on solid foundations. The buzz comes from its role in the perpetual futures space, where speed, depth, and on-chain data are driving next-level platforms. Its infrastructure meets the needs of fast-moving markets while staying decentralized. For those waiting on bullish sentiment to return, Hyperliquid is the one to stalk. The price may not be perfect yet, but the structure is strong, and when it moves, it could move big. 4. BNB: Real Utility Meets Long-Term Power BNB is one of the few tokens that doesn‚Äôt just rely on speculation. As the fuel behind Binance Smart Chain, it powers trading, staking, and governance, putting it at the center of daily crypto activity. Despite market dips, BNB is holding near all-time highs. That kind of stability is turning heads at the institutional level. Talks of BNB-backed products, crypto funds, and new treasuries show just how deep the value runs. For traders playing the long game, BNB isn‚Äôt just an exchange token, it‚Äôs a foundation for serious growth. BDAG Takes the Lead in This Altcoin Race Each of these picks has something to offer, from Sui‚Äôs sharp moves to BNB‚Äôs consistent traction. Hyperliquid shows us why structure matters, even at high prices. But one project is hitting on all fronts: BlockDAG. Presale strength? Check. $364 million locked in. Real tools? Already live. Community momentum? Surging. BlockDAG isn‚Äôt waiting to prove itself, it‚Äôs doing it right now. For those aiming for big upside, solid tech, and a clear launch plan, this is the top altcoin to watch before the next phase begins. If you‚Äôre serious about catching the next breakout, don‚Äôt let this one pass you by.

The Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), operating under South Korea‚Äôs Financial Services Commission (FSC), has initiated a comprehensive study. This move highlights the nation‚Äôs commitment to creating a robust and secure environment for digital assets, particularly stablecoins, through proactive virtual asset legislation . Why is South Korea Stablecoin Regulation So Important? On August 6th, the FSC‚Äôs FIU commissioned a pivotal FSC stablecoin study . This initiative focuses on the second phase of virtual asset legislation and aims to establish clear anti-money laundering (AML) measures for stablecoins. This proactive approach is designed to integrate stablecoins into the existing financial framework, allowing their legitimate use for payments and cross-border transfers. The goal is to foster innovation while ensuring consumer protection and financial stability. By bringing stablecoins under a regulatory umbrella, South Korea seeks to mitigate risks associated with illicit activities and market volatility. This is a critical step for the broader adoption of digital currencies and strengthens South Korea stablecoin regulation efforts. What Does This Stablecoin Legislation Entail? The upcoming stablecoin legislation is not just about compliance; it‚Äôs about defining the future role of these digital assets.

Priced at $0.035, the new DeFi project has caught the eye of traders. investors who get in on phase 6 presale of MUTM will experience a 71.43% return on investment as the project goes live at $0.06. Mutuum Finance has now surpassed over $14.1 million and over 14,800 investors. Meanwhile, legacy tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE) continue to struggle with sideways momentum and lack of innovation, making way for utility-driven platforms like Mutuum to dominate headlines and investor interest. As capital rotates into more purpose-built DeFi ecosystems, the narrative this month belongs not to memecoins but to the rise of next-gen, use-case-backed assets like MUTM. Dogecoin (DOGE) Hovering Near $0.20 Amid Rotation Toward Utility-Driven Tokens Dogecoin is currently trading around $0.20, having pulled back roughly 4% in the past 24 hours and about 15% off its July peak of around $0.26‚Äì$0.27 as investor appetite shifts away from meme narratives. Despite whale accumulation, over 2‚ÄØbillion DOGE (~$400M) observed at $0.21 support levels, technical indicators like weakening RSI and flat volume suggest momentum is waning. Short-term resistance sits in the $0.23‚Äì$0.24 zone, while support levels around $0.20‚Äì$0.21 could determine DOGE‚Äôs next path. As capital begins rotating toward utility-driven DeFi platforms, emerging protocol narratives like Mutuum Finance are increasingly drawing investor focus. Mutuum Finance Launches Phase 6 of Token Presale Mutuum Finance has recently introduced Round 6 of its presale with tokens now live at $0.035, a 16.17% increase from the last round. The next price increase will take the token up by another 14.29% to $0.04, so members will now be able to make 71.43% when it finally goes live at $0.06. The presale itself has already garnered over 14,800 investors and raised over $14.1 million, demonstrating the belief that the market has placed on the potential of MUTM. Dual-Lending: Empowering Future-Proof DeFi Mutuum Finance adopts a twin-model approach of facilitating flexibility and efficacy in Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending models. Peer-to-Contract makes use of autonomous smart contracts that carry out the lending independently without any participation of human beings whatsoever. They have been designed to operate on dynamic rates in the market with an unpredictable rate of interest as guided by existing demand and supply of an in-real-time interest. Peer-to-Peer model reduces intermediaries and allows market to be in direct interaction with borrowers and lenders. Mutuum Finance Boosts Stability Focus Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will introduce a stablecoin to be USD-pegged on the Ethereum blockchain. It will be sound and secure investment product to remove risk and uncertainty that can be attributed to algorithmic stablecoins. The project is audited with a 95.0 trust score by Certik. That is a key milestone as much as Mutuum Finance‚Äôs goal is to become an institutional-grade and transparent DeFi protocol. That also shows that the team is proud to be industry security standards-compliant. Mutuum Finance Deploys $50K Bug Bounty to Strengthen Protocol Security Mutuum Finance has initiated its Bug Bounty Program with the reward pool value of $50,000 USDT. There are four severity levels in the program. They include critical, major, minor, and low. All the probable bugs are hence found and rewarded. It is in line with the vision of the team to establish a secure, open, and quality DeFi protocol. As Dogecoin stalls near $0.20 with little to show in terms of innovation, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining momentum fast. The project has already raised over $14.1 million and attracted 14,800+ investors, signaling strong market confidence. Investors joining Phase 6 at $0.035 can lock in a 71.43% return when the token launches at $0.06. With a dual-lending system, USD-pegged stablecoin in development, CertiK audit, and $50K bug bounty, MUTM is proving it‚Äôs more than hype, it‚Äôs built for long-term growth. Join the presale before the next price increase hits.

The launch of its second-generation smartphone has captured the attention of both crypto investors and mobile tech enthusiasts. Meanwhile, early investors looking for the next big opportunity are also watching MAGACOIN FINANCE, a project gaining serious traction during its early stage with massive upside projections. Seeker Smartphone: A Web3 Powerhouse in Your Pocket Solana Mobile has begun shipping its new crypto-focused smartphone, the Seeker, to over 50 countries worldwide. With more than 150,000 units pre-ordered, it‚Äôs already outpacing the original Saga phone, which sold just 20,000. Retailing at $450‚Äì$500, the Seeker is expected to bring in at least $67.5 million in revenue. But what truly sets the Seeker apart is its deep integration with blockchain tools. It includes a hardware-isolated Seed Vault for securely storing private keys and recovery phrases, along with a decentralized app store that bypasses Apple and Google‚Äôs restrictive frameworks. This opens up direct access to NFTs, DeFi, games, and dApps‚Äîall without the usual 30% commissions or app store bans. New Contender Could Outperform Even Solana‚Äôs Gains While Solana is generating buzz with real-world products, MAGACOIN FINANCE is turning heads with numbers. With analysts forecasting up to 14,500% returns from its current stage, it‚Äôs quickly becoming one of the most talked-about altcoins of the year . As access tightens and allocations vanish, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing comparisons to early-stage SHIB and DOGE‚Äîbut with a more advanced ecosystem in development. For those entering before major exchange listings, the potential could be enormous. Is $500 SOL a Realistic Target? The buzz around the Seeker has added fresh fuel to Solana‚Äôs price outlook . Already showing strength amid altcoin rotation, SOL could ride the wave of mobile adoption to new highs. Analysts point to key ecosystem metrics‚ÄîDeFi TVL, NFT activity, and user growth‚Äîas signs of continued strength. If momentum holds, a run to $500 is within reach, especially considering the anticipation of spot ETF approval. Conclusion The Seeker‚Äôs launch marks a major step forward for crypto-native mobile tech, and Solana is leading the charge. But while SOL‚Äôs climb to $500 is drawing speculation, some investors are placing their bets on MAGACOIN FINANCE for even bigger returns . With limited access remaining and bold ROI projections , this might be the altcoin to watch as the next bull run unfolds.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Bitcoin (BTC) is treading water around $115K Thursday morning in Asia, up 1% in the last 24 hours, as the post-all-time-high correction continues to play out across low volume and weak conviction. According to Glassnode , BTC has entered what it calls an ‚Äúair gap‚Äù, a low-liquidity zone between $110,000 and $116,000, after breaking down from a major supply cluster where short-term holders had previously found support. These areas typically see little trading activity and can either serve as a base for accumulation or become a trapdoor for deeper downside if demand fails to return. ‚ÄúThe market is effectively re-finding its footing,‚Äù Glassnode analysts wrote, describing the range between $110K (the prior ATH) and $116K (recent buyer cost basis) as the new battleground. They noted that while opportunistic buying has emerged, with 120,000 BTC acquired on the dip, prices have yet to reclaim resistance levels convincingly, particularly the ~$116.9K threshold that marks recent short-term holder entry points. Short-term holder profitability has dropped from 100% to 70%, which Glassnode frames as typical for a bull market mid-phase. But without fresh inflows, this could quickly erode sentiment. ETF flows have turned negative, with a -1.5K BTC outflow earlier this week, the largest since April. At the same time, funding rates in the derivatives market have cooled, reflecting reduced leverage and a more cautious stance among speculators. Market maker Enflux offered a similar take: ‚ÄúCrypto markets remain in a fragile holding pattern. Despite some relief in the altcoin space, majors like BTC and ETH are still struggling to inspire confidence,‚Äù it wrote in a client note. ‚ÄúThe broader trend? Heavy legs with more or less light volume.‚Äù ETH is up 2% in the last 24 hours, trading just below $3,600. The CoinDesk 20 Index , which tracks a broad basket of crypto assets, gained 1.69% to 3,815.22. ‚ÄúUntil BTC and ETH reclaim strength with volume,‚Äù Enflux added, ‚Äúthe path of least resistance could remain sideways to down.‚Äù The market‚Äôs next move likely hinges on whether buyers are willing to step in and build a base within this low-volume zone, or whether another flush toward $110K is needed to reset the trend. For now, traders remain cautious, and the bulls remain unproven. Market Movers: BTC: A potential Bitcoin supply shock, driven by drying OTC desk reserves and steady corporate accumulation, could ‚Äúuncork‚Äù BTC price action after a dip below $110K, market observers say. ETH: Ethereum may have formed a local top as sell pressure hits $419 million, its second-highest on record, while ETH retests a major resistance zone near $4,000 that preceded a 66% drop in late 2024, raising the risk of a 25‚Äì35% decline by September; meanwhile, Polymarket bettors remain split, with 48% backing a rally to $5,000 despite the bearish signals. Gold: Gold's rally stalled Wednesday as traders took profits and weighed rising Fed rate cut odds, U.S. trade tensions, and a looming Fed leadership shakeup, leaving prices flat after a three-day gain driven by economic weakness; spot gold last traded at $3,372.11, down 0.24% on the day. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets opened mixed Thursday, with Japan‚Äôs Nikkei 225 flat, as investors shrugged off new U.S. semiconductor tariff threats. S&P 500: U.S. stock futures were flat Wednesday night as traders digested Trump‚Äôs new semiconductor tariffs, with the S&P 500 still up 1.7% for the week.

Economists and markets widely anticipate a 25 basis point cut , maintaining the central bank‚Äôs current once-per-quarter pace of monetary easing. The decision will be announced at 12 p.m. in London, followed by a press conference with Governor Andrew Bailey at 12:30 p.m. The rate cut would mark the fifth consecutive quarter-point reduction, bringing UK rates below those of the U.S. Federal Reserve, which last moved in 2024 and currently holds its benchmark at 4.25%‚Äì4.5%. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is expected to stick with its cautious guidance of ‚Äúgradual and careful‚Äù reductions, as inflation pressures re-emerge. June inflation came in at 3.6%, higher than the bank‚Äôs 3.4% forecast and its highest reading in 17 months, driven by surging energy and food prices. The BoE may now revise its near-term inflation outlook closer to 4% for the year. Governor Bailey has downplayed the spike as temporary, but Chief Economist Huw Pill and others have warned of second-round effects feeding into wages and core inflation. BoE faces mounting growth risks as job losses soar Meanwhile, growth concerns have intensified following back-to-back contractions in the spring and rising unemployment tied to April‚Äôs payroll tax and minimum wage hikes. More than 180,000 jobs have been lost since Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced a ¬£26 billion increase in employer national insurance contributions, pushing the unemployment rate to a four-year high. The MPC is expected to highlight these labour market challenges in its updated projections. In May, it forecast growth of 1% in 2025 and 1.25% in 2026, though recent data suggests a potential upward revision after better-than-expected Q1 performance and an upgraded estimate for Q2 growth. The decision is likely to expose divisions within the nine-member MPC. A Bloomberg survey suggests a three-way split: most members favouring a 25bp cut, two pushing for a larger 50bp move, and two likely to vote for no change. Pill and external member Catherine Mann, who opposed cuts in May, are expected to maintain their stance, while Swati Dhingra and Alan Taylor may advocate for a more aggressive reduction. While today‚Äôs move is mostly priced in, traders will be watching closely for any change in forward guidance. Markets expect one more cut this year, likely in November, bringing the rate down to around 3.5% by 2026. ‚ÄúThe risks are tilted in a hawkish direction,‚Äù said Dan Hanson, Chief UK Economist at Bloomberg Economics. ‚ÄúThe committee may signal it‚Äôs rethinking its once-a-quarter pace, implying a November cut isn‚Äôt guaranteed.‚Äù BoE reconsiders bond sales strategy as long-dated gilt yields surge Attention is also turning to the BoE‚Äôs balance sheet reduction strategy. Quantitative tightening (QT) has already reduced bond holdings by about ¬£100 billion annually, but market strain‚Äîespecially in long-dated gilts‚Äîhas sparked speculation that the BoE could slow or shift the pace of sales. Governor Bailey has recently flagged concerns over rising 30-year gilt yields, reaching levels last seen in the late 1990s. A pivot toward shorter-dated debt or a reduced pace of active sales (currently expected at ¬£26 billion a year) may be under consideration ahead of the BoE‚Äôs September QT update. According to Sanjay Raja, Chief UK Economist at Deutsche Bank, a signal acknowledging long-end liquidity issues could foreshadow changes in the BoE‚Äôs sales strategy.

During a podcast appearance this week, Long was openly skeptical of the¬†company behind XRP. She alleged that the company had fallen short of its initial mission, replacing traditional banking, specifically the SWIFT network. Although on top of this, she also claimed that Ripple‚Äôs past had ‚Äúall the makings‚Äù of an initial coin offering (ICO) and argued why Ripple would be releasing a new stablecoin on Ethereum rather than entirely through the XRP Ledger. Schwartz quickly took to social media, particularly X, dispelled the misinformation, and offered further engagement. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm available whenever you want to chat about the facts about Ripple, our stablecoin RLUSD, the XRP Ledger, and its native token XRP.‚Äù He wrote . Schwartz also directed readers to a detailed post by XRPL validator @Vet_X0, which ‚Äúsets the record straight‚Äù and is a useful entry point for anyone seeking factual information. XRPL validator rejects ‚ÄòICO‚Äô allegations The validator, Vet ( @Vet_X0 ), strongly rejected Caitlin Long‚Äôs characterization of XRP as the result of an initial coin offering (ICO). He said she appeared to lack a clear understanding of the subject, yet spoke about it confidently. Vet explained that Ripple did not raise funds through an ICO. Instead, when the XRP Ledger launched in 2012, the entire supply of 100 billion XRP tokens was placed in a genesis account. At that time, the tokens had no monetary value and no public sale or capital raise. This counters Long‚Äôs claim that XRP‚Äôs origins are comparable to projects like Ethereum, which conducted a well-documented public ICO in 2014, raising funds in Bitcoin to distribute ETH to early backers. Vet also had a beef with Long claiming not once, but twice, that Ripple essentially centralizes the XRP Ledger. Vet said Long‚Äôs comments were either ignorance or technical illiteracy. He said that XRP Ledger is open-source and decentralized, and that anyone could run a validator or fork the code. Currently, the XRPL hosts over 1,000 nodes and over 100 active validators, many of which are controlled by independent individuals, universities, businesses, and financial institutions, not Ripple. Ripple said it does not own these validators and can‚Äôt update the network unaided. Ripple expands RLUSD to both Ethereum and XRPL Caitlin Long is concerned that the choice made by Ripple to launch its RLUSD stablecoin on Ethereum contradicts its original vision of using the XRP Ledger as the backbone of global finance. She suggested switching to Ethereum might mean Ripple isn‚Äôt trusting in its infrastructure. XRPL validator Vet replied that RLUSD was to be issued on Ethereum and the XRP Ledger as a deliberate multi-chain strategy. He stressed that this isn‚Äôt a move away from XRPL but rather a pragmatic attempt to enhance liquidity and target a more diverse audience across other blockchain ecosystems. According to Vet, Ripple Payments and RLUSD continue to operate natively on the XRP Ledger, and Ethereum‚Äôs involvement merely complements‚Äînot replaces‚Äîthe network‚Äôs capabilities. Vet also took the opportunity to spotlight XRPL‚Äôs long-standing technical leadership. He noted that the XRP Ledger was the first blockchain to embed a decentralized exchange (DEX) directly into its protocol. It also pioneered native tokenization, enabling users to issue custom assets without relying on smart contracts. Development on the XRP Ledger, Vet stressed, has never stagnated. Its amendment system continually adds new features based on community consensus. He described the ecosystem as vibrant, supported by a growing developer base, strong liquidity, and deeper connections to real-world finance, which are further strengthened with the rollout of RLUSD.

As of today, ETH trades at approximately $3,598, reflecting a 1% decrease in the past 24 hours. This pullback follows months of mixed price action across the market, as traders balance optimism over long-term fundamentals with short-term risk management. New insights from on-chain data suggest heightened market activity surrounding Ethereum despite its failure to reclaim the $4,000 mark. Analysts point to unprecedented levels of Open Interest (OI) in Ethereum futures contracts, combined with record daily transactions on its network. While this signals growing participation and network adoption, it also raises concerns about potential volatility if market sentiment shifts abruptly. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Falters Above $3,700 ‚Äì Is a Pullback Brewing? Ethereum Open Interest Hits All-Time High CryptoQuant analyst CryptoOnchain reported that Ethereum‚Äôs OI on Binance has recently reached a record-breaking $77 billion. Open Interest measures the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, providing insight into market activity and trader participation. The surge suggests that more capital is entering ETH futures markets, potentially setting the stage for significant price movements. This rise in OI coincides with Ethereum reaching its highest daily transaction count ever recorded. Analysts link this spike in activity to increased engagement in decentralized finance (DeFi), growth in layer-2 scaling solutions, and broader adoption of Ethereum-based applications. CryptoOnchain noted that such developments ‚Äúhighlight growing participation and user engagement,‚Äù adding that this type of market buildup often precedes sharp price trends, either upward or downward. However, this accumulation of leveraged positions carries risk. If price movements turn unfavorable for the majority of open contracts, a wave of liquidations could occur, amplifying volatility. This has been a recurring theme in the cryptocurrency market, where leveraged positions can trigger cascading sell-offs during sudden price corrections. Bearish Signals Emerge from Market Order Activity Another CryptoQuant analyst, Maartunn, highlighted a different indicator that reflects short-term market pressure on Ethereum. According to his data, Net Taker Volume for ETH stood at -$418.8 million daily. This figure represents roughly 115,400 more ETH sold via market orders than bought, indicating a clear imbalance in favor of sellers. Market orders, unlike limit orders, execute trades immediately at the best available price. A sustained negative Net Taker Volume often signals urgency among sellers, potentially foreshadowing further downside if buy-side demand fails to absorb the selling pressure. Maartunn explained that ‚Äúsuch behavior indicates participants were willing to prioritize execution speed over price,‚Äù typically a bearish market sign.

In a high-level meeting with Vice President Gibran Rakabuming Raka‚Äôs office, representatives from Bitcoin Indonesia presented a detailed proposal outlining how the country could use surplus renewable energy to mine and accumulate Bitcoin as part of a long-term economic development plan. Indonesian Bitcoin (BTC) Reserve Move Despite stringent crypto tax policies and a nationwide ban on using crypto for payments, Indonesian officials are reportedly receptive to the idea of a Bitcoin reserve for the economy. A key component of the discussion involved the importance of public education, with Bitcoin Indonesia advocating for awareness programs to improve understanding of Bitcoin‚Äôs economic potential. The group also shared macroeconomic projections, including Michael Saylor‚Äôs bullish forecast of Bitcoin reaching $13 million by 2045. With a stable inflation rate of 0.76% and a debt-to-GDP ratio of just 39%, Indonesia‚Äôs interest in Bitcoin is not driven by economic desperation but rather by a strategic vision to diversify its reserves and leverage untapped geothermal and hydroelectric energy for sustainable mining. Brazil Moves Forward with Crypto Reserve Legislation While Indonesia explores its options, Brazil is already advancing a national conversation on Bitcoin reserves . The country‚Äôs House of Representatives is scheduled to hold a public hearing on August 20 to debate a bill that could allow up to 5% of its treasury, approximately $15 billion, to be allocated to Bitcoin. Six key institutions, including Brazil‚Äôs central bank and finance ministry, will participate in the discussions. Though the bill faces opposition from some financial authorities, Vice President Geraldo Alckmin‚Äôs office has endorsed it as being in the national interest. This marks Brazil‚Äôs first-ever public hearing on crypto reserves and underscores a growing global shift toward the institutionalization of Bitcoin. A Global Trend Toward Sovereign Bitcoin Holdings Indonesia and Brazil join a growing list of nations, including the United States, Ukraine, Bhutan, and Kazakhstan, that are actively exploring Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. While motivations vary, from hedging against inflation to modernizing financial infrastructure, the trend is clear: sovereign Bitcoin reserves are no longer a fringe idea. As more governments assess the potential of digital assets, Bitcoin‚Äôs role in national economic strategies appears poised to grow significantly, signaling a transformative era in global finance.

XRP is gaining renewed interest as traders adjust positions following news of the ETF delay. Stellar recently led the charts after a breakout rally, briefly pushing past major altcoins. While these price moves get coverage, the real opportunity may lie in platforms offering lasting utility and active user rewards. Cold Wallet is gaining traction on that front. Now in Stage 16 of its presale at just $0.00942, it combines self-custody, real-world utility, and up to 100% cashback. With a launch price set at $0.3517, it gives users a 3,600% return potential. Over 682.8 million coins have already been sold. Rather than hype-based movement, Cold Wallet ($CWT) offers a working system that delivers value daily. It‚Äôs shifting focus from price watching to actual use. XRP‚Äôs Price Slips as ETF Delay Shifts Focus Elsewhere XRP‚Äôs price saw a burst of activity earlier this month, but the momentum didn‚Äôt last. The delay in launching the inverse XRP ETF until August 4, 2025, cooled off the rally. Prices briefly spiked to $0.52 before slipping back below $0.50, signaling a dip in short-term confidence. For now, XRP‚Äôs next moves depend more on regulation than innovation. XRP still holds recognition in the crypto space, but its growth is now tied to external decisions. Without strong internal developments or fresh updates, many traders are pausing. Interest is shifting to platforms that offer benefits based on user engagement rather than news. Cold Wallet stands out for this reason. While XRP‚Äôs future depends on ETF rulings, Cold Wallet is already a rewarding activity. With cashback and clear usage incentives, it offers a dependable alternative. It‚Äôs building steady traction, powered not by speculation but by function. As users look for projects offering more than just headlines, Cold Wallet is making its way to the top. Stellar Slows Down After Brief Rally Fails to Hold Stellar made waves with a massive 63% rally over the past week, briefly outperforming many other altcoins. The run was fueled by renewed interest in Stellar‚Äôs role in remittance services and increased trade volumes. However, the rally ran into resistance as prices neared $0.13. Now, many see the coin entering a sideways consolidation phase, suggesting that the move may have peaked. Even with fast transaction times and low fees, Stellar‚Äôs offerings no longer feel unique in today‚Äôs Layer 1 space. Without major changes or upgrades, it risks fading from attention. The excitement around Stellar‚Äôs rise may weaken unless backed by deeper ecosystem growth. Cold Wallet, on the other hand, doesn‚Äôt depend on price spikes. It rewards every transaction through cashback tiers. This utility-first model continues working even during sideways markets. While Stellar stalls, Cold Wallet gives active users a reason to stay engaged and earn with every action. Cold Wallet Turns Daily Crypto Use Into Cashback and 50x Returns Cold Wallet fixes one of crypto‚Äôs biggest problems, transaction fees that punish users for staying active. Most platforms take value from the user, especially on swaps, gas fees, or fiat ramps. Cold Wallet reverses that idea. Every action within the app earns $CWT, the utility coin that powers its cashback model. At Stage 16 of presale, it‚Äôs priced at $0.00942. The launch value is fixed at $0.3517, creating a return of 3,600% for early supporters. But the appeal isn‚Äôt just upside. Cold Wallet gives users a direct way to earn on activity. Holding more $CWT unlocks greater cashback rewards, up to 100%. No staking. No lock-ins. Just use the platform and earn. It includes four loyalty tiers: Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Diamond. Top-tier users receive full gas refunds and 50% cashback on swap and ramp fees. This system benefits people who actually use the wallet daily, not just large holders waiting on price moves. More than 682.8 million coins have already been sold, and the project has raised $5.6 million. With referral rewards that give both sides something and cashback that activates without delay, Cold Wallet is building a model centered on value returned to the user. It isn‚Äôt a wallet you just store crypto in, it‚Äôs one that works for you every day. Cold Wallet Brings Practical Value While Others Wait As XRP‚Äôs progress stalls due to delayed ETF news and Stellar‚Äôs rally hits resistance, Cold Wallet is quietly building something more sustainable. It rewards users for actual activity, not just holding. With a 3,600% ROI opportunity, cashback on fees, and over 682.8 million coins sold, it‚Äôs already proving itself. Cold Wallet doesn‚Äôt rely on speculation or external triggers. Its model puts value back in users‚Äô hands, creating daily utility that works across all market conditions. While other platforms wait for catalysts, Cold Wallet continues gaining traction through function, making it one of the most practical and promising presale crypto plays today.

(MHT), a company listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE). This massive acquisition, facilitated through a share purchase agreement with metallurgical company RIZAP Group, Inc., positions Bakkt as the largest shareholder of MHT. Incorporating Bitcoin Into MHT‚Äôs Treasury Management Plans As announced on Wednesday, part of this transaction will see Phillip Lord, the President of Bakkt International, assume the role of Chief Executive Officer at MHT. Under his leadership, MHT plans to incorporate Bitcoin (BTC) and other digital assets into its treasury management strategy. Furthermore, Bakkt has secured the domain name www.bitcoin.jp , which, pending approval from MarushoHotta‚Äôs shareholders, is set to become the new identity for the company. In a statement, Akshay Naheta, co-CEO of Bakkt, expressed enthusiasm for the opportunity, citing Japan‚Äôs regulatory environment as a favorable landscape for developing a Bitcoin-centric business model. He emphasized the intention to collaborate closely with MHT‚Äôs team to seamlessly integrate Bitcoin into their operational and financial framework , aiming to establish MHT as a foremost Bitcoin treasury company: Japan‚Äôs regulatory environment creates an ideal platform for a Bitcoin-centered growth business. We look forward to working with MHT‚Äôs team to integrate Bitcoin into their operating and financial model and to establish MHT as a leading Bitcoin treasury company. Bakkt Faces Setbacks As Stock Drops This acquisition aligns with Bakkt‚Äôs broader strategy to enhance its Bitcoin holdings. Recently, the company announced plans to raise up to $1 billion through various securities offerings, a move that reflects a growing trend among publicly traded companies to bolster their cryptocurrency reserves. The proposed offering includes shares of Class A common stock and pre-funded warrants, with underwriters being given a 30-day option to purchase an additional 15% of the shares sold, allowing for potential over-allotments. However, the timing, size, and terms of the offering remain contingent on market conditions. Despite these ambitious initiatives, Bakkt has encountered challenges. In March 2025, the company‚Äôs stock, BKKT , experienced a significant drop of 30% following news that two major clients, including Bank of America, would not be renewing their financial agreements with Bakkt. As of this writing, BKKT‚Äôs valuation closed Wednesday‚Äôs trading session at $9.77, up 2.5% for the day. However, the stock is trading over 70% below this year‚Äôs high of $31. Looking at a longer time frame, BKKT reached a record high of $1,271 in November 2021, which is nearly a 100% gap, further highlighting the firm‚Äôs challenges in recent years.

Meanwhile, the US is making significant progress toward its mission of becoming the crypto capital of the world. Despite this ambitious plan, concerns about potential capital flight are reportedly hindering the rapid advancement of stablecoin technology within the country. China Explores Stablecoin Initiatives According to a report from the Financial Times, Hong Kong has emerged as a testing ground for cryptocurrency, particularly given the strict bans on the mainland. Recently, the territory passed legislation allowing licensed businesses to issue tokens backed by any fiat currency. However, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has taken a cautious stance, indicating that only a limited number of licenses will be issued starting next year. Related Reading: Bitcoin Insult Alert: Pro Trader Dubs HODLers ‚ÄòIdiots,‚Äô Saylor Fires Back Policymakers in China have increasingly turned their attention to stablecoins, recognizing the growing dominance of dollar-backed tokens in the global economy. The central bank governor, Pan Gongsheng, noted in a June speech that stablecoins have ‚Äúfundamentally reshaped the traditional payment landscape.‚Äù However, the Chinese government faces a delicate balancing act; while it seeks to enhance the global standing of the renminbi, it must also maintain stringent controls over its financial system. Recent discussions among financial regulators have centered on the implementation of stablecoin projects, emphasizing that any such initiative must align with China‚Äôs unique national conditions. Yet, experts have cautioned that the risks associated with capital outflows could pose significant challenges. Interest Grows In Hong Kong Rebecca Liao, CEO of Saga, a company focused on blockchain infrastructure, articulated the complexities of adopting stablecoin technology, highlighting that it cannot be completely controlled by central authorities. This concern has contributed to Hong Kong‚Äôs slower progress in developing a thriving stablecoin market, especially when compared to the rapid growth observed in the United States. The HKMA has voiced apprehensions about the potential use of stablecoins in money laundering, emphasizing the need for stability and control in its new regulatory framework. As such, initial stablecoin programs in Hong Kong are expected to focus on business-to-business applications, limiting their broader adoption. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Bull Run In Jeopardy? Expert Reveals Strategy‚Äôs Alleged Plan To Sell All BTC Holdings The report emphasizes that interest in stablecoins is also growing among Chinese state-owned enterprises, particularly in the context of payment and settlement solutions. Multiple state-owned companies with operations in Hong Kong are reportedly looking to apply for stablecoin licenses, although only one of China‚Äôs four major state-owned banks is expected to receive a license from the HKMA in this initial phase. The HKMA has not ruled out the possibility of approving licenses for stablecoins backed by offshore renminbi, a move that could further facilitate cross-border payments‚Äîan area of increasing importance for China.

With Ripple‚Äôs banking initiative nearing launch and a potential XRP ETF approval looming, the crypto landscape is primed for movement. Seasoned traders know that dips often present the best buying opportunities‚Äîespecially when paired with strong catalysts. Among the altcoins gaining attention, MAGACOIN FINANCE has quietly emerged as a sleeper pick . Still in its presale stage, this low-cap project is drawing early comparisons to top performers from previous cycles. XRP‚Äôs ETF Catalyst and Bank License Fuel Buying Interest XRP has been regaining momentum as Ripple inches closer to resolving its long-running legal standoff with the U.S. SEC. A $50 million settlement is reportedly in the works, which would clear the path for institutional XRP sales. More significantly, rumors of an XRP ETF filing by BlackRock and other asset managers are ramping up. At the same time, Ripple‚Äôs push to secure a banking license is being viewed as a game-changing move. Analysts believe these developments could send XRP back toward the $3 range, with any ETF approval likely triggering a major rally akin to the Bitcoin ETF surge earlier this year. The Altcoin that Draws Early Whales Before Major Listings While large caps like XRP and ADA attract institutional buzz, MAGACOIN FINANCE is making waves in the high-ROI altcoin space. Currently in presale, the project has already recorded explosive early growth, with analysts projecting a potential 25x return if momentum continues. The MAGACOIN ecosystem is designed to blend meme coin virality with real-world utility, offering a hybrid approach that‚Äôs drawing strong community support. Investors are rushing to secure presale allocations before listings begin, citing similarities to early-stage PEPE and Shiba Inu‚Äîwith a more strategic roadmap in place. ADA Still Trading Far Below All-Time Highs‚ÄîBut Not for Long Cardano (ADA) has seen relatively quiet price action, but under the surface, excitement is building. The upcoming Midnight airdrop‚Äîa privacy-focused sidechain‚Äîis driving renewed interest in ADA holders. Historically, major network developments like this have preceded price rallies. Despite past underperformance compared to other top ten assets, ADA remains well below its all-time high near $3. Given its current positioning, any surge in usage or airdrop speculation could unlock a strong recovery, making ADA a solid mid-cap hold during this dip. Conclusion Market pullbacks often separate the emotional traders from the strategic ones. With XRP nearing a resolution, ADA gearing up for airdrop momentum, and MAGACOIN FINANCE blazing through its early stages with explosive projections , this dip may not last long. The smart money is already positioning.

A significant wave of Ethereum accumulation is underway, with institutional players and corporate treasuries making substantial moves into the ETH market. This trend signals a maturing digital asset landscape and could have profound implications for the future of the second-largest cryptocurrency. What‚Äôs Driving This Significant Spot ETH ETFs & Treasury Inflow? Nate Geraci, the respected president of NovaDius Wealth Management (formerly The ETF Store), recently shared compelling data on X. His report highlights a remarkable trend: since early June, companies holding Ethereum in their treasuries and newly emerging spot ETH ETFs have each acquired approximately 1.6% of the total Ethereum supply. This combined effort represents a staggering 3.2% of all ETH. Such a substantial absorption of tokens by these entities is a strong indicator of growing institutional confidence. It also suggests a long-term investment perspective rather than speculative trading. This steady inflow points to a strategic move by major players to secure a significant portion of the network‚Äôs native asset. It reflects a belief in Ethereum‚Äôs foundational technology and its potential for future growth. The Impact on ETH Supply and Market Dynamics When large entities like corporate treasuries and exchange-traded funds start buying up a significant percentage of an asset, it naturally impacts the available ETH supply . Here‚Äôs why this matters: Reduced Circulating Supply: As more ETH moves into long-term holdings and ETF reserves, less of it is available for day-to-day trading on exchanges. Potential Price Pressure: A reduced supply, coupled with sustained demand, can create upward pressure on Ethereum‚Äôs price over time. This is a fundamental economic principle. Market Validation: Institutional buying provides a strong vote of confidence. It validates Ethereum as a legitimate and valuable asset class, attracting further investment from traditional finance. This ongoing accumulation acts as a powerful signal to the broader market. It suggests that major financial players are increasingly comfortable allocating capital to digital assets, especially those with strong utility like Ethereum. Who Are These Ethereum Treasuries and Why Does It Matter? The term ‚Äò Ethereum treasuries ‚Äò refers to companies that hold ETH as part of their corporate reserves, similar to how they might hold cash, gold, or other traditional assets. This practice has gained traction as more businesses recognize the potential of blockchain technology and decentralized finance. Why is this significant? Diversification: Companies are diversifying their balance sheets with digital assets. Strategic Alignment: For many, holding ETH aligns with their business strategies, particularly those involved in Web3, NFTs, or DeFi. Long-Term Horizon: These are typically not short-term speculative plays but rather long-term strategic investments, implying a belief in Ethereum‚Äôs enduring value. The emergence of spot ETH ETFs also provides a regulated and accessible pathway for traditional investors to gain exposure to Ethereum without directly owning the cryptocurrency. This bridges the gap between traditional finance and the crypto market. The Future of Institutional Ethereum Investment: What‚Äôs Next? The recent surge in institutional Ethereum accumulation, highlighted by Nate Geraci‚Äôs report, paints a clear picture: major financial players are taking Ethereum seriously. This trend is likely to continue as regulatory clarity improves and more traditional investment vehicles become available. What can we expect going forward? Continued ETF Growth: As more spot ETH ETFs launch globally, they will likely continue to absorb a significant portion of the available supply. Broader Corporate Adoption: More companies may follow suit, adding ETH to their balance sheets as a hedge against inflation or as a strategic asset. Increased Market Stability: Large, long-term institutional holdings can contribute to greater market stability by reducing volatility often associated with retail speculation. This systematic accumulation by well-funded entities underscores Ethereum‚Äôs evolving role from a niche digital asset to a recognized, investable asset class within the global financial system. It‚Äôs a testament to the network‚Äôs robust ecosystem and its potential for widespread adoption. Conclusion: A New Era for Ethereum The collective efforts of spot ETH ETFs and corporate treasuries to acquire 3.2% of the total ETH supply since June mark a pivotal moment for Ethereum. This significant Ethereum accumulation by institutional players signals a profound shift in how traditional finance views and engages with digital assets. As more of the ETH supply is locked away in long-term holdings, the stage is set for a future where institutional Ethereum plays an even more dominant role in shaping the market. This ongoing trend not only validates Ethereum‚Äôs position but also paves the way for greater stability and mainstream integration. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Ethereum accumulation by treasuries and spot ETH ETFs? Ethereum accumulation by treasuries refers to companies holding ETH as part of their corporate balance sheets. Spot ETH ETFs are investment funds that hold actual Ethereum, allowing traditional investors to gain exposure without directly buying and storing the cryptocurrency. Both are actively acquiring significant amounts of ETH. Q2: How much of the total ETH supply has been acquired by these entities since June? According to Nate Geraci‚Äôs report, corporate treasuries and spot ETH ETFs have each acquired approximately 1.6% of the total ETH supply, leading to a combined Ethereum accumulation of roughly 3.2%. Q3: What impact does this accumulation have on the overall ETH supply? This significant accumulation reduces the amount of ETH supply available on exchanges for trading. This can lead to increased scarcity, potentially putting upward pressure on Ethereum‚Äôs price if demand remains strong or grows. Q4: Why are companies adding Ethereum to their treasuries? Companies are adding Ethereum to their Ethereum treasuries for various reasons, including diversification of assets, strategic alignment with Web3 or blockchain initiatives, and as a long-term investment believing in Ethereum‚Äôs future growth and utility. Q5: Does this institutional interest mean Ethereum is becoming more stable? Yes, the increasing involvement of institutional Ethereum investors, particularly those with long-term holding strategies, can contribute to greater market stability. Their large, less volatile holdings can help cushion price swings often associated with retail trading. Did you find this article insightful?

This technical retest comes as institutional momentum heats up: Satsuma Technology just raised $218 million in BTC-denominated funding, adding to a broader wave of long-term capital moving into Bitcoin. With higher lows forming since April and major players like pension funds and SBI Holdings expanding crypto exposure, the setup for a breakout toward $123K is becoming harder to ignore. Satsuma‚Äôs Bold Bitcoin Bet London-based Satsuma Technology has made headlines with a $217.6 million convertible credit note , the first of its kind in the UK to be fully subscribed in Bitcoin. This funding round, backed by Pantera Capital, Kraken, Blockchain.com, and UK asset managers overseeing more than ¬£300 billion, outperformed its target by 63%. JUST IN: Satsuma Technology raises $217.6M to expand Bitcoin treasury strategy. pic.twitter.com/t0bFAv80Qy ‚Äî ChainDesk (@ChainDesk_) August 6, 2025 Despite the positive momentum, Satsuma‚Äôs stock slipped 14%, a move analysts attribute to profit-taking and short-term volatility. CEO Henry Elder confirmed the capital will support their plan to fuse decentralized AI infrastructure via Bittensor with a Bitcoin-native treasury strategy. Currently holding 1,126 BTC at an average entry of $115,149, Satsuma‚Äôs position is nearly break-even, reflecting firm conviction in Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term trajectory amid broader market turbulence. The raise aligns with a growing macro trend: $7.8 billion in crypto asset acquisitions were disclosed last week, with $2.7 billion flowing into Bitcoin alone. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technical Setup Points to Breakout Bitcoin is showing notable technical strength. Price action around $114,980 is consolidating just above two key supports: The 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $112,860 Long-term ascending trendline stretching back to April. This confluence zone, where resistance has flipped into support, is often a bullish continuation signal. Bitcoin Price Chart ‚Äì Source: Tradingview RSI is about to cross above 50, which could be the start of the bullish momentum. The chart shows a broad ascending triangle with higher lows and accumulation below $123,206. A break above this level could unleash the buyers towards $131,337 and $138,680. If the trendline holds, it‚Äôs a stair-step rally. But if it breaks below $111,995 it could shift the sentiment and open the door for a drop to $105,225 or $99,500. Volume confirmation and a bullish engulfing candle above $115,000 would be the perfect entry for swing traders. BTC Trade Setup (Short-Term): Entry: Break above $115,000 Targets: $123,200 Stop-Loss: Below $113,800 If this triangle breakout confirms, bulls could regain control, especially if paired with renewed institutional inflows and ETF stability. Institutions Double Down on BTC In the U.S., the Michigan State Retirement System just tripled its Bitcoin ETF exposure, adding 200,000 shares of the ARK 21Shares BTC ETF to its portfolio, now valued at $11.4 million. This comes despite over $1.4 billion in outflows across U.S. ETFs last week, signaling long-term conviction. Michigan also holds $13.6 million in Grayscale‚Äôs Ethereum Trust , unchanged since 2024. Though crypto remains a small slice of its $19.3 billion portfolio, analysts say the Sharpe ratio for Bitcoin is increasingly attractive for pension strategies seeking asymmetric returns with manageable risk. Michigan State Pension Triples Bitcoin ETF Exposure, Latest Filing Shows ‚ñ∫ https://t.co/kllKdIYnpZ https://t.co/kllKdIYnpZ ‚Äî Decrypt (@DecryptMedia) August 6, 2025 Across the Pacific, Japan‚Äôs SBI Holdings is awaiting approval for the country‚Äôs first Bitcoin-XRP ETF. If greenlit, it would be listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange ‚Äî unlocking institutional access in a tightly regulated market. A second ETF, blending gold and crypto, is also in the pipeline. These developments could dramatically boost Asian inflows, especially if Japan‚Äôs Financial Services Agency reclassifies crypto under the FIEA statute ‚Äî a shift that could redefine institutional access across the region. What‚Äôs Next for BTC? With BTC holding support near $115K and institutional narratives strengthening across the U.S., U.K., and Japan, the foundation is set for a bullish continuation. If the ascending triangle plays out, Bitcoin could break through $123K resistance and revisit $131K or $138K in the near term and possibly set the stage for a Q4 run toward $250K or higher.

After a period of quiet, US spot Bitcoin ETFs have made a significant comeback. On August 6, these investment vehicles collectively saw a substantial net inflow of $91.52 million. This positive shift is particularly noteworthy as it broke a five-day streak of net outflows, signaling renewed investor confidence in the digital asset space and specifically in spot Bitcoin investment products. What Drove the Recent Bitcoin ETF Inflows? The latest data, shared by crypto analyst Trader T on X, paints a clear picture of this encouraging trend. The $91.52 million in total net inflows marks a decisive turn for Bitcoin ETF inflows . This isn‚Äôt just a small bump; it‚Äôs a significant indicator that institutional and retail interest in Bitcoin exposure through regulated channels is regaining momentum. BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT led the pack, attracting a robust $41.9 million in inflows. Bitwise‚Äôs BITB followed closely, securing $26.35 million. Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC , despite its higher fees, managed to pull in $14.5 million. Fidelity‚Äôs FBTC added $10.06 million to its coffers. VanEck‚Äôs HODL contributed with $4.08 million in inflows. Interestingly, not all funds experienced inflows. ARK Invest‚Äôs ARKB saw a net outflow of $5.37 million on the same day. However, the overall picture remains overwhelmingly positive, with the majority of major players showing strong net gains. Understanding BTC ETF Performance: A Closer Look This surge in inflows for US spot Bitcoin ETFs highlights a critical aspect of the evolving cryptocurrency market: the growing acceptance and integration of digital assets into traditional finance. Spot Bitcoin ETFs allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements without directly holding the cryptocurrency. This convenience and regulatory oversight are key attractions for a broad range of investors, from large institutions to individual traders. The daily flow data provides a real-time pulse of market sentiment. When funds like BlackRock and Fidelity, major players in traditional finance, see consistent inflows, it suggests a broader shift towards embracing Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. This positive BTC ETF performance can also influence broader market sentiment for Bitcoin itself, potentially leading to increased price stability or even upward momentum. What‚Äôs Next for Crypto ETF Trends? The August 6th inflows offer a glimmer of optimism, but what does this mean for future crypto ETF trends ? While one day‚Äôs data doesn‚Äôt establish a long-term pattern, it certainly provides a hopeful sign. Investors and analysts will be closely watching subsequent days‚Äô performance to see if this trend of net inflows continues or if it was an isolated event. Continued inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs could indicate: Increased Institutional Adoption: More institutions might be allocating capital to Bitcoin through these regulated products. Renewed Retail Interest: Individual investors, perhaps waiting for clearer market signals, might be re-entering the market. Market Maturity: The consistent use of ETFs suggests the market is maturing and becoming more accessible. However, it is important to remember that the crypto market remains volatile. External economic factors, regulatory news, and broader market sentiment can all impact these flows. Monitoring these trends is crucial for anyone involved in digital asset investment. Conclusion: A Positive Shift for Spot Bitcoin Investment The $91.52 million net inflow into US spot Bitcoin ETFs on August 6 is a welcome development for the cryptocurrency ecosystem. It marks an end to a period of outflows and showcases renewed confidence from investors across various funds. While the journey of digital assets in traditional finance is still unfolding, this positive turn in Bitcoin ETF inflows is a strong indicator of growing interest and potential stability for the market. It underscores the increasing importance of regulated investment products in making Bitcoin accessible to a wider audience, paving the way for further mainstream adoption. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a US spot Bitcoin ETF? A US spot Bitcoin ETF is an exchange-traded fund that directly holds Bitcoin. It allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements without having to buy and store the cryptocurrency themselves. These funds trade on traditional stock exchanges. Why are net inflows into Bitcoin ETFs important? Net inflows indicate that more money is entering these funds than leaving them. This suggests increasing investor demand and confidence in Bitcoin as an asset class, particularly through regulated investment vehicles. It can also be a positive sign for Bitcoin‚Äôs price. Which US spot Bitcoin ETFs saw the most inflows on August 6? On August 6, BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT led with $41.9 million in inflows, followed by Bitwise‚Äôs BITB ($26.35 million), Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC ($14.5 million), Fidelity‚Äôs FBTC ($10.06 million), and VanEck‚Äôs HODL ($4.08 million). Do all Bitcoin ETFs experience inflows? No, not all Bitcoin ETFs experience inflows simultaneously. On August 6, for example, ARK Invest‚Äôs ARKB saw net outflows. Fund performance can vary based on investor preference, fees, and specific fund strategies. How do Bitcoin ETF inflows impact the broader crypto market? Significant and sustained inflows into Bitcoin ETFs can signal growing institutional and retail interest, potentially leading to increased liquidity, greater price stability, and overall positive sentiment for Bitcoin and the wider cryptocurrency market.

Recently, U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs witnessed a remarkable influx of capital, with a combined net inflow of $34.15 million on August 6. This significant event marks the second consecutive trading day of positive flows, signaling growing investor confidence in Ethereum-backed financial products. This trend highlights a crucial shift in how traditional investors are engaging with the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. What‚Äôs Driving These Ethereum ETF Inflows? This impressive surge in Ethereum ETF inflows didn‚Äôt happen by chance. Data shared by Trader T reveals that key players are actively accumulating positions. Leading the charge was BlackRock‚Äôs ETHA, which alone attracted a substantial $32.41 million in inflows. This demonstrates strong institutional appetite for regulated crypto exposure. BlackRock‚Äôs ETHA: Dominant with $32.41 million in inflows. Grayscale‚Äôs ETHE: Added $10.04 million, showing continued interest in established products. ARK 21Shares‚Äô CETH: Contributed $0.37 million, rounding out the positive contributors. However, it wasn‚Äôt universally positive. Grayscale‚Äôs mini ETH experienced a net outflow of $8.67 million. This suggests some investors might be reallocating within their Ethereum holdings or optimizing their exposure strategies. Other ETFs reported no change in their holdings for the day, maintaining a steady stance. Understanding the Impact on ETH ETF Performance The consistent positive flow, particularly the second consecutive day of net inflows, is a strong indicator of robust ETH ETF performance . It reflects increasing comfort among institutional and retail investors with regulated vehicles for accessing Ethereum‚Äôs potential. This trend can lead to greater market stability and broader acceptance of digital assets. Why is this important? When large investment firms like BlackRock see significant inflows into their products, it often validates the underlying asset. For Ethereum, this means more capital is being directly channeled into its ecosystem, potentially boosting liquidity and market cap over time. It also signifies a maturing market where traditional finance is increasingly intertwined with decentralized technologies. How Do These Inflows Affect the Broader Crypto ETF Market? The success of U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs has ripple effects across the entire crypto ETF market . Positive performance in one segment, especially a major one like Ethereum, often inspires confidence in other digital asset products. This can pave the way for more diverse crypto ETF offerings in the future, expanding options for investors seeking exposure to various cryptocurrencies without direct ownership. This institutional embrace through ETFs helps bridge the gap between traditional finance and the volatile crypto world. It provides a regulated, accessible pathway for a wider range of investors, from large funds to individual retirement accounts, to participate in the growth of digital assets. This legitimization is crucial for the long-term health and expansion of the crypto market. The Future of Digital Asset Investment Looks Bright These recent inflows underscore a growing appetite for digital asset investment . The ability to invest in Ethereum through regulated ETF products offers significant advantages, including ease of access, liquidity, and oversight. As the market matures, we can expect to see continued innovation in financial products that cater to diverse investor needs. The transparency provided by ETF structures also builds trust. Investors can track holdings and performance easily, fostering a more informed and secure investment environment. This positive momentum for U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs could be a precursor to even greater institutional adoption and innovation in the broader digital asset space. In conclusion, the substantial $34.15 million in net inflows into U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs on August 6 marks a pivotal moment. Led by BlackRock, this trend signifies robust institutional confidence and a maturing market for digital asset investments. It‚Äôs a clear signal that Ethereum, through its ETF vehicles, is firmly establishing its place in mainstream finance, promising an exciting future for the crypto market.

In 2023, only 3% of respondents reported receiving any part of their salary in crypto. That figure jumped to 9.6% in 2024, as blockchain-native firms and DAOs increasingly turned to stablecoins and tokens to compensate employees and contributors. At the same time, the share of workers paid exclusively in fiat dropped from 97% to 89.1%. This shift shows a broader willingness among companies to integrate digital assets into day-to-day operations, particularly in roles that span borders or operate within decentralized ecosystems. Stablecoins Become Standard for Crypto Wages, USDC in Front Among those receiving crypto compensation, USDC was the dominant choice. The dollar-pegged stablecoin accounted for 63% of all crypto salaries, far outpacing USDT , which held a 28.6% share. Other tokens like Solana and Ethereum made up a smaller slice, with 1.9% and 1.3%, respectively. Our mission is to support the long-term success of both our portfolio companies and the broader crypto ecosystem. One major gap we‚Äôve consistently seen? Reliable, transparent compensation data for crypto teams. That‚Äôs why we created our annual Crypto Compensation Survey ‚Äì a‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Pantera Capital (@PanteraCapital) August 6, 2025 Pantera‚Äôs survey covers blockchain engineers, product managers, legal and operations staff across the industry. The results suggest that stablecoins are no longer limited to trading pairs or DeFi use cases, but are also becoming a practical tool for payroll and international payments. USDC Adoption in Payroll Strengthened by Monthly Reserve Disclosures Crypto compensation offers several advantages, especially for globally distributed teams. Stablecoins enable faster settlement times, lower transaction fees and easier access to US dollar value in regions with banking restrictions or currency instability. The findings also point to growing confidence in USDC‚Äôs reputation for regulatory compliance and transparency, particularly after Circle, its issuer, began publishing detailed monthly reserve reports and secured access to US Treasuries. More Workers Opt to Split Salaries Between Cash and Crypto While full salary payments in crypto remain uncommon, hybrid arrangements are gaining traction. Many firms now allow employees to split their compensation between fiat and digital assets, giving workers the option to dollar-cost average into crypto markets or spend directly using Web3 wallets. Pantera‚Äôs report did not disclose regional trends, but the surge in crypto salaries is likely driven in part by Asia-based teams and contractors who rely on stablecoins for cost-effective cross-border payments. The rise of on-chain compensation also comes as more crypto-native companies formalize operations. With better treasury management tools, real-time payroll rails and accounting platforms tailored for digital assets, the logistical barriers to paying in crypto are beginning to fall.

This major move by an address linked to James Wo, founder of the crypto venture capital firm DFG, has caught the attention of many, especially given the staggering crypto whale profit involved. This transaction highlights the dynamic nature of digital asset markets and the substantial gains possible for long-term holders. Unpacking the Massive James Wo ETH Sale: What Happened? An address believed to belong to James Wo has offloaded all its Ethereum holdings, marking a substantial transaction. Over the past two days, a total of 3,634.2 ETH, valued at approximately $13.29 million, found its way to Binance Exchange. This particular stash of Ethereum was accumulated back in February 2023, with an average acquisition cost of $1521.95 per ETH. The timing of this extensive James Wo ETH sale is notable, occurring after more than two years of holding these assets. This strategic divestment has resulted in an estimated profit of $7.796 million, a truly remarkable gain from their initial Ethereum holdings . Such a move by a prominent figure often sparks widespread discussion within the crypto community. The Role of On-Chain Analysis in Uncovering Major Moves How do we know about such large-scale transactions? This information comes to light thanks to meticulous on-chain analysis . Experts like @ai_9684xtpa on X actively monitor blockchain data, tracking the movement of significant cryptocurrency amounts. This transparency is a core feature of public blockchains, allowing anyone with the right tools to observe transactions. On-chain data provides invaluable insights into market trends, potential whale movements, and shifts in investor sentiment. It helps the community understand where large amounts of digital assets are moving and who might be behind those movements, even if identities are presumed rather than explicitly confirmed.

In July 2025, the blockchain payments giant filed for a charter to launch Ripple National Trust Bank, a limited-purpose national trust bank headquartered in New York. The goal: provide enterprise-grade custody, tokenization infrastructure, and stablecoin management‚Äîwithout operating as a traditional deposit-taking bank. The move includes a request for a Federal Reserve Master Account, which would allow Ripple to directly access the U.S. payment system for settlement, a leap forward in integrating crypto into traditional banking. While the bank is still awaiting final regulatory approval, the announcement has already reignited market speculation, particularly around Ripple‚Äôs native token XRP and major assets like Ethereum. Meanwhile, early-stage altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE are catching tailwinds from the broader surge in institutional interest. XRP Testing Key Levels as Market Eyes $3.69 Currently trading between $3.03 and $3.07, XRP recently broke out of a downward channel but is now facing resistance at $3.14 and $3.34. Technical analysts note that a clean breakout above $3.34 could trigger a move toward $3.69 or even higher, particularly if regulatory clarity continues to improve. Ripple‚Äôs proposed bank could accelerate XRP adoption by boosting institutional trust. With a dedicated infrastructure for safeguarding reserves, managing RLUSD (Ripple‚Äôs stablecoin), and facilitating cross-border payments, XRP could find itself at the center of a more regulated and scalable payment system. The bullish scenario? A legal victory combined with a banking license approval‚Äîtwo catalysts that could launch XRP toward new highs. Ethereum Approaches $4,000 as Bulls Take Control Ethereum is trading strong between $3,555 and $3,720. After gaining more than 40% in the past month, ETH is showing resilience amid broader market volatility. Key resistance lies at $3,881 and $4,234, and analysts remain bullish provided ETH continues to defend the $3,400 range. Ethereum stands to benefit indirectly from Ripple‚Äôs banking play as well, given the broader legitimization of tokenized infrastructure and blockchain-integrated banking services. With ETH‚Äôs growing presence in tokenized treasuries, stablecoins, and DeFi infrastructure, any movement toward regulatory clarity tends to strengthen Ethereum‚Äôs investment case. Momentum with Fresh Capital Rotation into Breakout Contenders Ripple‚Äôs growing institutional influence is prompting early investors to explore the next big opportunity‚Äîespecially among projects still in presale. That shift has brought major attention to MAGACOIN FINANCE, which has recently experienced a surge in whale inflows and early staking momentum. Ripple‚Äôs Trust Bank Launch Could Fuel MAGACOIN FINANCE 22,500% Gains‚ÄîOutpacing XRP Projections , according to some analysts. The project is riding the wave of rising institutional appetite with a meme-fueled narrative, early timing, and strategic accumulation that‚Äôs beginning to resemble early DOGE and SHIBA cycles. Investors seeking asymmetrical upside are watching MAGACOIN FINANCE closely as ETF-driven inflows trickle down to presale markets. Conclusion: Ripple‚Äôs Banking Play Sets the Stage Ripple‚Äôs National Trust Bank proposal isn‚Äôt just another crypto headline‚Äîit‚Äôs a signal that blockchain is entering Wall Street‚Äôs core financial architecture. If approved, it could catapult XRP and ETH to new heights‚Äîand in doing so, may fuel a new generation of breakout altcoins. MAGACOIN FINANCE is already capturing that energy, one wallet at a time.

Cardano (ADA) is holding strong near its support zone with slight upside, while Pi Coin (PI) is making headlines through wallet updates aimed at access and usability. Both show movement, but neither offers early access to real market tools or previews of in-action utilities. BlockDAG stands out. Using the TRADEBDAG code, buyers unlock a live trading simulator that mirrors real presale activity. This isn‚Äôt about future plans, it‚Äôs a hands-on experience now, giving users a better sense of what to expect post-launch. Among trending crypto coins, BlockDAG ‚Äôs utility-first approach clearly breaks the mold and brings more engagement early on. BlockDAG‚Äôs Live Simulator Previews Market Action! Most early-stage crypto projects rely on promises. BlockDAG flips the script. The TRADEBDAG code gives full access to its Trading Dashboard, a real-time simulator that previews actual BDAG trading post-launch. Users can view BDAG/USD price charts, track the live order book, and place trades that update wallet balances instantly. It brings a working prototype to users‚Äô hands now. This tool isn‚Äôt just about trying it out. It allows participants to build trading confidence and understand real market behavior before the official launch. The goal is to shift the presale from passive holding to full user interaction, which makes the experience more exciting and rewarding. BlockDAG‚Äôs GLOBAL LAUNCH release makes this more exciting. Although the current Batch 29 price is $0.0276, buyers can use the special GLOBAL LAUNCH rate of $0.0016 until August 11. This opens a potential 3,025% return, based on the confirmed $0.05 launch price. So far, $361 million has been raised, with over 24.7 billion coins sold. Batch 1 buyers have already seen a 2,660% ROI. As the presale momentum continues, BlockDAG proves it isn‚Äôt just selling a future idea. It‚Äôs showing exactly what‚Äôs coming next and why it matters for early access users. Pi Wallet Improves Access With Fiat Options A new Pi Wallet update is drawing fresh attention to Pi Coin (PI), especially with features designed to improve access. The wallet now supports payments through Apple Pay, Google Pay, and debit cards via Banxa and Onramper. This lowers the entry barrier and makes it easier for users to buy PI with fiat. The update also added a ‚ÄúBUY‚Äù button, streamlining user experience and hinting at broader adoption goals. There are also signs that the wallet may support other digital assets soon, which would give it a role beyond the Pi ecosystem. That could reshape how users interact with it long term. Together, these upgrades highlight a broader shift in PI‚Äôs direction. The team is clearly focused on improving access, building infrastructure, and supporting mainstream use. While exchange listings are still pending, the current updates help PI stay visible among trending crypto picks that focus on usability and interface experience. ADA Bounces Back From $0.69 Support Cardano (ADA) dropped from $0.83 to nearly $0.69 between July 28 and August 2, showing six straight days of red candles. This drop tested the long-standing $0.69 support level and caught traders‚Äô attention due to its consistent decline. Since then, ADA has recovered with two green sessions and now trades close to $0.73. ADA is currently stuck inside a multi-year symmetrical triangle. Analysts are watching the $0.72 to $0.73 range as a key breakout zone. If ADA moves higher, it could touch $0.75 or even $0.80 soon. Under the right conditions, some targets stretch as far as $0.96 by the end of August. Despite recent pressure, ADA‚Äôs ability to hold support has caught attention. It remains one of the top coins with long-term upside as traders track potential breakout levels, especially while larger altcoins move sideways or struggle to reclaim momentum. The Bottom Line Pi Coin (PI) is gaining users through wallet updates. Cardano (ADA) is holding its ground at support. But neither gives access to real-time trading before the next phase or lets users test anything ahead of listings. BlockDAG does. The TRADEBDAG code unlocks full use of its Trading Dashboard, where buyers can view price charts, place trades, and see wallet balances shift live. It‚Äôs not just testing, it‚Äôs real-time simulation based on current presale activity, which provides early training and excitement. For those looking at top crypto coins right now, BlockDAG offers a working product, not just future potential. With its $0.0016 GLOBAL LAUNCH release valid till August 11, BlockDAG puts real tools and opportunity directly in users‚Äô hands, turning curiosity into real engagement before market listings go live.

49671163,549656,1754535656,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49671163.jpeg,Worldcoin in the Spotlight Again as China Warns of Biometric Data Threats,https://bitcoinist.com/worldcoin-in-spotlight-again-china-warns-biometric/,"China‚Äôs Ministry of State Security (MSS) has raised alarms over a foreign company‚Äôs (likely Worldcoin) collection of biometric data from users in exchange for cryptocurrency rewards, calling the practice a potential threat to both individual privacy and national security. The warning, published Wednesday on the agency‚Äôs official WeChat account, pointed to documented cases of large-scale iris data collection linked to crypto token distributions . While the MSS did not explicitly name the project, the description closely aligns with Worldcoin, a project developed by Tools for Humanity. Worldcoin has gained attention for using its ‚Äúorb‚Äù devices to scan users‚Äô irises to create unique digital IDs and distribute its cryptocurrency token, WLD. According to the MSS, the transfer of these sensitive data sources to external entities ‚Äúposes risks not only to personal privacy but also to the country‚Äôs national security,‚Äù as biometric information can potentially be exploited beyond its stated purpose. Growing Global Scrutiny of Biometric Crypto Projects China‚Äôs warning adds to mounting global scrutiny over biometric data collection in the digital asset industry. Worldcoin, launched in 2023, has faced investigations and regulatory actions in multiple jurisdictions, primarily over concerns surrounding data protection and user consent. In May, Indonesian authorities suspended the project‚Äôs operating permit following reports of irregularities related to Worldcoin‚Äôs identity verification services. Tools for Humanity later stated that World voluntarily paused its proof-of-personhood operations in Indonesia while seeking clarity on licensing requirements . This is not the first time China has voiced concerns about crypto-linked risks. The country has long maintained strict policies on digital asset trading and initial coin offerings (ICOs), emphasizing consumer protection and financial stability. Last month, Shenzhen‚Äôs financial regulator issued an alert warning citizens about fraudulent schemes disguised as stablecoin investments. The MSS statement expands the scope of concern, highlighting how biometric data collection linked to crypto incentives can cross into national security territory, particularly if foreign entities manage or store sensitive information. Implications for Privacy and Regulation in the Crypto Space The latest development reflects a broader debate around privacy, identity verification, and decentralized finance. Projects like Worldcoin argue that iris scans enable a secure and scalable method of proving human identity online, which could help distinguish real users from automated bots in Web3 applications. Critics, however, have cautioned that once biometric data is collected, the risk of misuse or unauthorized access remains high, even if encrypted or anonymized. China‚Äôs public statement suggests that the country may increase oversight of foreign crypto projects operating within its jurisdiction or collecting data from Chinese nationals. This aligns with global regulatory trends, where authorities are seeking to strike a balance between technological innovation and the protection of sensitive personal information. In Europe, data regulators have opened probes into Worldcoin‚Äôs activities under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), while Kenya temporarily halted Worldcoin registrations over similar privacy concerns in 2023. The MSS has urged the public to exercise caution when approached with offers to exchange personal data for cryptocurrency rewards.

Some analysts suggest that the cryptocurrency is preparing for a massive rally. Related Reading: Solana To Drop Before The ‚ÄòReal Move‚Äô? Analyst Forecasts New Highs In Q3 Cardano Retests Key Resistance Following last week‚Äôs drop to the $0.70 support, Cardano is attempting to break out of a crucial resistance level to continue its rally. The cryptocurrency has surged 8.8% from Friday‚Äôs low, retesting the $0.74-$0.76 area throughout this week. Notably, ADA has been hovering between the $0.65-$0.85 price range since the Q2 market recovery, briefly losing this area during the June pullback. However, the July market pump sent the altcoin to a four-month high of $0.93, sparking bullish sentiment among investors. Since then, Cardano has been in a downtrend, attempting to break out of the descending resistance for the past two weeks. Market watcher Sebastian noted that the cryptocurrency has repeatedly retested the $0.76 zone over the past few days, suggesting that ‚Äúthe more it tests it, the higher the likelihood to break it.‚Äù According to the analyst, ADA must reclaim the 50-day Moving Average (MA), which has served as a strong resistance and support level and coincides with the descending resistance breakout area. Following today‚Äôs performance, the altcoin has reclaimed the 50 MA indicator and eyes a retest of the $0.76 resistance. A breakout from this level would set the stage for a retest of the next crucial area between $0.79 and $0.80. ‚ÄúGetting back above $0.80 would confirm the trend reversal,‚Äù Sebastian affirmed. Meanwhile, a rejection from this area could propel Cardano to retest the recent lows and risk losing its local range again. ADA Breakout Eyes 85%-120% Rally Man of Bitcoin noted ADA‚Äôs recent performance, asserting that it is ‚Äúnow potentially working on a small 1-2 setup.‚Äù Based on this, he suggested that ‚Äúas long as the price remains above the last swing low at $0.685, wave-5 of iii should follow next.‚Äù Meanwhile, analyst Ali Martinez highlighted that the cryptocurrency has been trading within a descending channel since its December 2024 high of $1.32. According to the chart, ADA retested the channel‚Äôs upper boundary for the first time in months during the July breakout but was ultimately rejected. Reclaiming the $0.76 could propel the altcoin to the channel‚Äôs resistance, and ‚Äúa breakout above $0.84 could set Cardano on a path toward $1.30.‚Äù Additionally, Martinez asserted that ‚ÄúADA is showing the same price structure as the last cycle, only this time, it‚Äôs unfolding more gradually. And it feels like we‚Äôre right at the beginning of an explosive move.‚Äù Similarly, Crypto Bullet stated that Cardano has been following a pattern over this cycle. Per the chart, the cryptocurrency has been trading down for months before breaking out and reaching new local highs. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin‚Äôs Price Discovery Rally Over? This Week‚Äôs Performance May Hold The Answer Last month, the cryptocurrency broke out of its eight-month downtrend, targeting a rally toward the $1.60 area.

As of this writing, Cardano is trading at $0.74, a 3% increase in the daily timeframe.

For traders engaged in derivatives, understanding market mechanics is crucial. Today, we delve into a critical indicator: the crypto perpetual futures liquidation data from the past 24 hours. This breakdown offers a fascinating glimpse into recent market volatility and prevailing market sentiment . What Exactly is Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation? In the world of derivatives, a perpetual future is a type of futures contract that has no expiration date. This allows traders to hold leveraged positions indefinitely. However, leverage comes with inherent risk. When a trader‚Äôs position falls below a certain margin requirement, it triggers a ‚Äúliquidation.‚Äù Essentially, their position is automatically closed by the exchange to prevent further losses. This is a crucial aspect of the perpetual futures market . Our focus here is on short liquidations . A short position profits when the asset price goes down. Conversely, if the price unexpectedly rises sharply, these short positions face liquidation. High short liquidations often indicate a ‚Äúshort squeeze,‚Äù where a sudden price increase forces many short sellers to close their positions, further fueling the price rally. Decoding the Latest 24-Hour Crypto Liquidations The past 24 hours have seen significant activity in the perpetual futures market , particularly concerning liquidations. Here‚Äôs a detailed look at the breakdown: ETH: $60.27 million in liquidations, with a dominant 62.65% being short positions. This suggests a notable upward price movement for Ethereum, catching many short sellers off guard. BTC: $22.29 million in liquidations, with an even higher 75.45% being short positions. Bitcoin experienced a strong surge that led to substantial losses for those betting on a price decline. MYX: $13.13 million in liquidations, with 66.58% being short positions. This altcoin also saw a significant number of short positions wiped out, reflecting similar market dynamics. These figures highlight a clear trend: a strong upward movement in these assets, leading to the forced closure of numerous short positions. The overwhelming percentage of short liquidations across all three assets points to a market that moved decisively against bearish bets, impacting overall market sentiment . Why Do Short Liquidations Dominate the Perpetual Futures Market? The dominance of short liquidations in this 24-hour period reveals a specific kind of market action. When a large number of traders are betting on prices to fall, a sudden positive catalyst or significant buying pressure can trigger a chain reaction. As prices rise, short positions quickly become unprofitable. Exchanges then step in, liquidating these positions to protect themselves and maintain market stability. This forced buying to close short positions further accelerates the price increase, creating a ‚Äúshort squeeze.‚Äù It‚Äôs a powerful phenomenon that can lead to rapid upward price spikes, as observed in the recent crypto liquidations data. Understanding this dynamic is key to interpreting current market sentiment . Actionable Insights from Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation Data For traders, monitoring crypto perpetual futures liquidation data is more than just observing numbers; it‚Äôs about gaining strategic insights. High short liquidations can signal a strong underlying buying pressure or a market turning point where bearish sentiment is being overwhelmed. Conversely, high long liquidations would suggest a market correction or a significant downturn. What can you do with this information? Firstly, it emphasizes the importance of robust risk management, especially when using leverage. Secondly, it provides a real-time pulse on current market sentiment . If short liquidations are consistently high, it might indicate a resilient market ready to push higher, or at least one that is punishing overly bearish bets. Always combine this data with other technical and fundamental analysis for a comprehensive trading strategy. In conclusion, the past 24 hours provided a stark reminder of the volatility and potential for sharp movements within the crypto market. The substantial short liquidations across ETH, BTC, and MYX underscore a period where bullish momentum surprised many bearish traders. Monitoring these trends offers valuable insights into the market‚Äôs underlying strength and the risks associated with leveraged trading. Stay informed, stay strategic. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is crypto perpetual futures liquidation? A1: Crypto perpetual futures liquidation occurs when a trader‚Äôs leveraged position in a perpetual futures contract falls below a certain margin requirement. The exchange automatically closes the position to prevent further losses, protecting both the trader and the market. Q2: Why were short liquidations so high in the last 24 hours? A2: High short liquidations indicate that many traders betting on price declines (short positions) were caught off guard by a sudden upward price movement. This often leads to a ‚Äúshort squeeze,‚Äù where forced buying to cover positions further fuels the price increase. Q3: How does liquidation impact the crypto market? A3: Liquidations can amplify price movements. A wave of crypto liquidations can accelerate a rally (if shorts are liquidated) or a crash (if longs are liquidated), leading to increased volatility and rapid shifts in market sentiment . Q4: What does this data mean for an average trader? A4: For an average trader, this data underscores the inherent risks of leveraged trading and highlights the importance of risk management. It also provides insight into the prevailing market momentum; high short liquidations suggest bullish strength and a market punishing bearish bets. Q5: Is it possible to avoid liquidation? A5: While not always entirely avoidable in extreme market conditions, traders can significantly reduce the risk of liquidation by using lower leverage, setting stop-loss orders, and maintaining sufficient margin in their accounts. Proper risk management is key in the perpetual futures market . Did you find this breakdown helpful?
