Internet Computer protocol price forecast for 2028 expects the token to reach a peak price of $36.8. By 2031, the price of Internet Computer might reach a maximum of $113.32. Internet Computer (ICP) is a groundbreaking blockchain network developed by the DFINITY Foundation. It aims to extend the functionality of the internet, enabling it to host backend software and transforming it into a global, decentralized computer. Internet computer blockchain incorporates advanced cryptography and innovative technology to provide scalable, efficient, and secure decentralized applications (dApps). Given its robust technology and expanding utility, the Internet Computer blockchain‚Äôs future price prospects look promising. As more developers build on the platform and adoption increases, ICP token demand will likely rise. Does Internet Computer coin have a future? How much will Internet Computer coin cost in 2025? Will ICP reach $1000? Let‚Äôs get into the current price analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Internet Computer Token ICP Price $5.12 Market Cap $2.74B Trading Volume $66.21M Circulating Supply 536.26M ICP All-time High $750.73 (May 10, 2021) All-time Low $2.86 (Sep 2023) 24-h High $5.16 24-h Low $4.96 Internet Computer Network technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day period) 5.69% 14-Day RSI 42.80 50-Day SMA $5.29 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 54 (Neutral) Green Days 16/30 (53%) 200-Day SMA $6.09 Internet Computer price analysis TL;DR Breakdown ICP remains bearish despite 1.48% daily gains. OBV shows heavy selling pressure. A break below $5.00 could trigger a cascade toward $4.812. ICP 1-day price analysis The daily chart for August 6 shows ICP trading at $5.122 with a modest +1.48% gain, yet with concerning underlying weakness. The price action remains trapped within the Bollinger Bands, with the upper band at $6.204 acting as strong resistance and the lower band at $4.812 providing support. ICPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD indicator shows both the signal line and MACD line residing in negative territory, while the histogram shows minimal bullish divergence at -0.007, suggesting momentum remains firmly bearish despite today‚Äôs minor uptick. ICP 4-hour price analysis The 4-hour timeframe shows ICP trading below the 20-period SMA at $5.138, which immediately signals short-term bearish pressure. The On Balance Volume plunging to -41.29M exposes significant selling pressure that contradicts any surface-level price stability, while the Balance of Power reading of -0.86 confirms sellers dominate the current market structure. ICPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The recent candlestick formation shows alternating green and red bars with substantial wicks, indicating intense battles between buyers and sellers around the $5.10-$5.15 range, though the bearish OBV suggests money continues flowing out despite these consolidation patterns. ICP technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $5.03 BUY SMA 5 $5.17 SELL SMA 10 $5.34 SELL SMA 21 $5.59 SELL SMA 50 $5.29 SELL SMA 100 $5.35 SELL SMA 200 $6.09 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $5.35 SELL EMA 5 $5.32 SELL EMA 10 $5.25 SELL EMA 21 $5.28 SELL EMA 50 $5.73 SELL EMA 100 $6.69 SELL EMA 200 $7.77 SELL What to expect from ICP price analysis The current market condition points toward further downside pressure, with the immediate target being the lower Bollinger Band at $4.812. Bears maintain control through negative MACD readings and substantial OBV outflows, while bulls struggle to reclaim the 20-day SMA at $5.138. Any break below $5.00 psychological support could trigger accelerated selling toward $4.50, whereas sustained recovery above $5.20 would be needed to invalidate the bearish market. Is Internet Computer a good investment? The Internet Computer (ICP) has shown significant potential and volatility since its launch, which is common for relatively new and ambitious blockchain projects. Its technology aims to decentralize the internet and bring smart contract functionality to the web, which could have wide-ranging implications for the future of web speed. However, the market performance of ICP has been highly volatile, and its success depends heavily on the adoption of its technology and the broader market environment for cryptocurrencies. Please note that before you make an investment decision, seek independent professional consultation. Will Internet Computer reach $25? Yes, Internet Computer ICP might reach and surpass $25 as early as 2027. Will Internet Computer reach $50? Yes, Internet Computer is expected to reach $50. Though the current internet computer sentiment is sideways, future price movements and market cap are expected to be positive. Will ICP reach $1000? Although its ATH sits at $750.73, attaining $1000 in the foreseeable future might be impossible.

49661491,549593,1754521214,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49661491.jpeg,"Ripple Flamed By Caitlin Long: ‚ÄòXRP Is Doomed, Banks Don‚Äôt Trust It‚Äô",https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-flamed-by-caitlin-long-xrp-doomed/,"Caitlin Long, founder and CEO of Custodia Bank, delivered one of the harshest assessments yet of Ripple and the XRP ecosystem in a recent episode of the Gold Goats ‚Äòn Guns podcast, calling into question the project‚Äôs credibility, tokenomics, and long-term viability in institutional finance. In a sweeping critique, Long stated bluntly: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not going to take over. If it were going to take over, it would have taken over a long time ago.‚Äù Caitlin Long Slams Ripple And XRP The conversation began with a reference to growing speculation that Ripple might be among the blockchain networks ‚Äúblessed‚Äù by regulators to handle tokenized financial infrastructure. But Long pushed back hard on that narrative, saying the idea ‚Äúoverstates how important that network is.‚Äù According to Long, the core issue lies in Ripple‚Äôs structural legacy. ‚ÄúThe banks have always been suspicious of it,‚Äù she said, citing what she described as the project‚Äôs centralized architecture and flawed tokenomics. ‚ÄúIt is a centralized network and the tokenomics are backwards.‚Äù She argued that the XRP supply model ‚Äî rooted in a massive pre-mine and upfront fundraising ‚Äî has permanently damaged institutional trust. ‚ÄúThe people who extracted money up front are never going to be trusted because everybody is going to look and think that anything they do is an exit scam to try to dump on retail.‚Äù For Long, the contrast with Bitcoin and Ethereum is stark. ‚ÄúThe most effective tokenization platforms are the ones where there was no money up front or very little money up front,‚Äù she explained. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs Bitcoin and Ethereum.‚Äù Long also interpreted Ripple‚Äôs recent pivot ‚Äî with the company now launching its own regulated stablecoin ‚Äî as a tacit admission of failure. ‚ÄúInstead of trying to sell that into the banking industry, they‚Äôre getting their own regulated financial institutions and trying to issue a stablecoin,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs kind of, in some ways, an admission that the base layer blockchain didn‚Äôt get the adoption they were looking for.‚Äù Her comments come amid Ripple‚Äôs continued push into institutional markets, including efforts to obtain a US bank charter and launch a US dollar stablecoin. While these moves have been celebrated in some circles as signs of maturity and strategic adaptation, Long framed them as a fallback, noting that the original promise ‚Äî to become a foundational layer for interbank settlement ‚Äî had clearly not materialized. ‚ÄúThe base layer network is not going to become the base layer of replacing SWIFT,‚Äù she said. She also pointed to the legal and regulatory drag Ripple faced over the past several years, including the SEC‚Äôs long-running lawsuit against the company for allegedly conducting an unregistered securities offering. ‚ÄúThat hamstrung them,‚Äù she said, while acknowledging that Ripple wasn‚Äôt alone in suffering under the Biden administration‚Äôs broader crackdown on crypto: ‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt hurt Ripple as much as the Fed hurt us‚Ä¶ Everybody who was targeted by the Biden administration was hurt to varying degrees.‚Äù When asked what network the US Treasury is most likely to choose for tokenizing US Treasuries, Long was unequivocal: ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not going to use Ripple. They‚Äôre going to use Ethereum. They may use Bitcoin, but the Bitcoin layer twos are not mature enough for something like that.‚Äù She cited Ethereum‚Äôs technical maturity and infrastructure readiness as the decisive factors. XRP Community Reacts The backlash from the XRP community was swift and furious. Prominent community figure Crypto Eri called the remarks ‚Äúugly tribalism,‚Äù accusing Long of conflating Ripple with the XRP Ledger, and failing to distinguish between a centralized company and a decentralized protocol. ‚ÄúThe entire blockchain community should be deeply disappointed,‚Äù she wrote. Digital Asset Investor, another well-known XRP supporter, tagged Ripple executives directly, suggesting the company was still on track to achieve regulatory breakthroughs. Ashley Prosper went even further, alleging that Long‚Äôs criticism may stem from frustration over Custodia Bank‚Äôs lack of a Federal Reserve master account : ‚ÄúSounds like Caitlin Long is mad that Ripple will get their Fed master account before Custodia Bank.‚Äù But Long‚Äôs criticism was not offhanded nor casual ‚Äî it was pointed and rooted in her long-standing perspective on what makes blockchain infrastructure bank-grade. For her, trust, decentralization, and long-term neutrality are prerequisites ‚Äî and XRP, in her view, fails on all three. ‚ÄúRipple‚Äôs been at this longer than almost anybody else and they haven‚Äôt made a lot of progress,‚Äù Long concluded. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really that simple.‚Äù At press time, XRP traded at $2.94.",XRP|Caitlin Long|ripple|ripple news|XRP news|XRP price,EN,0,0,XRP|FIAT|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-06 23:00:14

Yet sometimes, a project does more than follow market flow; it reshapes it. When talking about the best crypto coins to buy now, it‚Äôs about more than price jumps. It‚Äôs about ongoing development, functional use cases, and a shift in user experience. Here are four crypto coins standing out today, each driving change in unique ways. Leading the charge is BlockDAG, offering a presale experience unlike any other. BlockDAG: Real-Time Trading Dashboard During Presale Rather than just showing high returns, BlockDAG (BDAG) is reworking the entire presale model. Typical presales offer limited access and basic visuals. BlockDAG changes that with an interactive simulator featuring live BDAG/USD charts, a real-time order book, and functioning BUY/SELL tools. This isn‚Äôt a placeholder; it‚Äôs a real trading experience, available even before exchange listings. A standout feature is the wallet-synced interface. Once users buy BDAG, their connected wallet reflects it instantly, mirroring real-time market actions. This level of interaction is almost unheard of in the presale phase and sets a high bar for other projects. BlockDAG‚Äôs performance also speaks volumes. With over $363 million raised and more than 24.7 billion coins sold, the presale is now in batch 29 at $0.0016. The price holds until August 11th. Early buyers have already seen 2,660% growth in their funds since batch 1, proving its strength. BlockDAG continues to shape presale strategies, making it one of the best crypto coins to buy now. Bittensor: Real AI Applications on the Blockchain Bittensor earns its place by blending AI and decentralization with actual function. Unlike projects built on hype, Bittensor runs a system where AI models operate in an open framework and earn rewards in TAO tokens. These rewards are based on processing power, not social chatter. That core design aligns price and performance more naturally than many speculative plays. Contributors provide computing output and are rewarded directly, reinforcing measurable outcomes. As demand for AI-based systems grows, Bittensor keeps proving its relevance. Its long-term appeal is tied to a strong use case. With few serious rivals in the decentralized AI space, Bittensor remains one of the best crypto coins to buy now for those who believe in utility-based growth. Ethereum: Evolving Infrastructure and Steady Strength Ethereum remains a major force in crypto, not because of short-term spikes, but due to its foundation in real-world applications. As the go-to smart contract platform, Ethereum dominates DeFi, NFTs, and the rollup-driven Layer 2 ecosystem. Recent efforts to improve scaling and reduce gas fees through rollups show the network‚Äôs forward momentum. Its growth doesn‚Äôt rest on novelty, but on a steady expansion of tools, adoption, and developer output. Interest from institutions remains consistent. With staking, ETFs, and multiple ecosystem updates, Ethereum holds its place as one of the best crypto coins to buy now, showing how a well-established network can continue setting new standards for others. XRP: Strong Base Backed by Legal Clarity and Utility XRP continues to gain strength due to clearer regulatory standing and increasing real-world use. After positive developments in its legal matters, XRP‚Äôs value is now more tied to activity than speculation. Ripple‚Äôs efforts in Asia and the Middle East highlight XRP‚Äôs real use in cross-border payments. Large banks testing the system for transactions show there is consistent demand grounded in actual utility. Though news events still move the price, XRP‚Äôs current position is more solid than in past cycles. For those watching utility-led growth, XRP stands out as one of the best crypto coins to buy now. Final Thoughts! Focusing only on price charts won‚Äôt give the full story when deciding the best crypto coins to buy now . What matters is which projects are reshaping how people engage with digital assets. BlockDAG stands out by offering a pre-listening trading experience that other presales don‚Äôt provide. Bittensor shows real progress in decentralized AI. Ethereum continues to strengthen its base, while XRP pushes ahead with clarity and purpose. Together, these projects show that true performance is more than just price; it‚Äôs how they redefine expectations and deliver value.

No influencer push. No meme-fueled chaos. Just a smart idea, clean tokenomics, and the kind of product that doesn‚Äôt need overexplaining. And it‚Äôs catching on fast. While many presales drown in buzzwords or recycled hype, DeSoc is building something that speaks to a wider audience of creators, users, and investors who are tired of platforms taking everything while offering almost nothing in return. DeSoc isn‚Äôt trying to replace social media. It‚Äôs trying to fix the part that matters: ownership. With a working DeFi model that connects directly to major platforms like Instagram, TikTok, X, and Facebook, the project is gaining momentum for reasons that go beyond price speculation. It‚Äôs the latest viral craze, not because it‚Äôs loud, but because it makes sense. This Isn‚Äôt Just a Crypto Presale . It‚Äôs a Product People Actually Want DeSoc is being built as a decentralized content platform that allows creators to publish once and syndicate everywhere. Through its API integrations, a user can post on DeSoc and have their content show up across their other social accounts automatically. But the real difference is what happens behind the scenes. Every post, interaction, or tip is stored immutably on-chain. That means full transparency, clear audit trails, and a creator-first model that cuts out the middlemen. In short, it‚Äôs decentralized finance applied to the internet‚Äôs social layer. It‚Äôs not about hype. It‚Äôs about giving people the tools to own what they create and to get rewarded for it directly. Tokenomics that Makes absolute Sense A lot of crypto presales throw together tokenomics as an afterthought. DeSoc took the opposite approach. Of its 3 billion $SOCS tokens, 45% are allocated to the presale. That‚Äôs not just a liquidity move, it‚Äôs a signal to early users that they‚Äôre part of something foundational. Another 20% is set aside for development. Five percent of that goes to the team, with a two-year lock-in in place. 15% goes to the marketing team, community rewards get 10%, and 10% is reserved for liquidity. There‚Äôs also a 30-year liquidity lock, one of the longest commitments we‚Äôve seen in the space. Real Monetization, Real Use Cases, Real Incentives Here‚Äôs where DeSoc really stands apart. This DeFi platform lets creators earn through tipping, content gating, subscriptions, and micropayments. Premium content? Pay to unlock it. Want to promote a post? Use your $SOCS tokens . It‚Äôs simple, direct, and designed to make engagement valuable. You can also use tokens for peer-to-peer payments, in-app purchases, and even support charitable causes or creators directly. Think of it as decentralized finance built into everyday social activity, without the jargon or the barrier to entry. The creator economy has been waiting for something like this. Now that it‚Äôs here, it‚Äôs no surprise people are piling in. Community-Driven, Governance-Ready DeSoc isn‚Äôt a token you just hold and forget. Governance is built into the platform. Token holders can submit proposals, vote on platform upgrades, and help shape reward systems and future features. Everything is executed through smart contracts, with options for quadratic voting to ensure more balanced outcomes. The idea is to move beyond passive token holding and into actual decision-making, something crypto presale buyers rarely get to be part of. It‚Äôs transparent, it‚Äôs participatory, and it gives users a voice from the start. The $10 Million Milestone? That‚Äôs just the Beginning! Plenty of projects raise big numbers. Few do it with this much clarity. DeSoc‚Äôs $10 million haul didn‚Äôt happen because of luck or noise. It happened because the pitch is clear, the product is working, and the timing is right. As more creators look to break free from platform dependency and as users demand more control over what they see and share, DeSoc lands in the perfect spot. It‚Äôs not just a platform. It‚Äôs a model for how decentralized finance can actually support real people doing real things online. And right now, it‚Äôs still early. Each presale stage offers slightly higher pricing, rewarding those who move first but keeping access open to new buyers who see the long-term vision. Conclusion DeSoc didn‚Äôt go viral by accident. It offered something that felt fresh and backed it up. It‚Äôs the kind of crypto presale that gives the space a better name. No pump-and-dump. No smoke and mirrors. Just product, people, and progress. DeSoc is quietly showing what happens when you build for value, not just volume. With more funding pouring in and features rolling out, this latest viral craze might end up being one of the smartest early-stage moves in decentralized finance right now.

Whales Are Bailing, Retail‚Äôs Late",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-bull-run-already-over-whales-bailing/,"CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn used today‚Äôs price weakness to publish a granular, 10-part ‚ÄúBitcoin Market Analysis‚Äù on X that dissects the post-ATH landscape with on-chain detail and a clear technical line in the sand. ‚ÄúBitcoin broke its all-time high, but here‚Äôs the catch: long-term holders are [starting] to sell into the strength,‚Äù he wrote, adding that what matters now is how the market digests that supply above and around the breakout zone. In his framing, the first stress test is underway. Is The Bitcoin Bull Run Over? The thread anchors around one headline-grabbing datapoint: ‚Äúthe LTH selling pressure includes the 80,000 BTC sold by the Satoshi-era wallet.‚Äù That description is Maartunn‚Äôs interpretation of July‚Äôs extraordinary movement of eight ‚Äúancient‚Äù wallets that shifted roughly 80,000 BTC after ~14 years of dormancy via Galaxy Digital. Beyond the drama of this single entity, Maartunn argues that behavior across the holder spectrum is what‚Äôs driving the tape. ‚ÄúRetail is stepping in after the ATH,‚Äù he noted, describing a familiar pattern of late-cycle enthusiasm that followed Bitcoin‚Äôs push through $120,000 in mid-July. That surge set a new record near $123,000 before momentum faded; spot prices are now revolving around $113,000‚Äì$115,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Secretly Tracking This Market Signal: Weiss Crypto The bid didn‚Äôt vanish entirely. ‚ÄúFresh capital did help the ATH-breakout buyers,‚Äù Maartunn wrote, pointing to balance-sheet demand ‚Äúfrom firms like Strategy and Metaplanet.‚Äù Those purchases are verifiable. Strategy‚Äîthe rebranded MicroStrategy‚Äîdisclosed 21,021 BTC bought between July 28 and Aug. 3 at an average of ~$117,256, lifting its holdings to ~628,791 BTC. Tokyo-listed Metaplanet added 463 BTC on Aug. 4, taking treasury holdings to 17,595 BTC. Even so, those corporate flows ‚Äúweren‚Äôt enough to hold Bitcoin around the ~$120k level,‚Äù the analyst said. Where the thread turns more cautionary is on short-term hands. ‚ÄúShort-Term Holders started to puke and sell at a loss,‚Äù Maartunn wrote, quantifying realized-loss waves of 52,230 BTC (July 15‚Äì18), 42,493 BTC (July 24‚Äì28), and 70,028 BTC ‚Äúafter July 31.‚Äù He called the last episode notable ‚Äúnot just [for] the size, but the duration,‚Äù arguing that prolonged STH loss-realization is a pressure valve that typically needs time to exhaust. These are Maartunn‚Äôs on-chain tallies; they have not been separately published by data vendors in aggregate form. The flows picture from listed products has begun to rhyme with that stress. ‚ÄúETFs are also seeing outflows,‚Äù he observed. Multiple trackers confirm a downswing: CoinShares logged the first net weekly outflow in 15 weeks (-$223 million) with Bitcoin funds leading at -$404 million, while daily tallies this week show US spot Bitcoin ETFs bleeding for several sessions, including about -$196 million on Tuesday. Framing differs by window, but the direction is clear: the bid from ETFs is wobbling at the margin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Risks Another Crash Following Recovering Into Bearish FVG Zone Technically, Maartunn fixes attention on the former breakout zone. ‚ÄúBitcoin is finding support around its previous ATH ‚Äî roughly $112K,‚Äù he wrote, pointing to a confluence between chart structure and on-chain price-distribution. His on-chain map ‚Äúbacks it up,‚Äù flagging ‚Äústrong support in the $108K‚Äì$112K range,‚Äù an area where a large volume of coins last changed hands. Context matters. Bitcoin‚Äôs July all-time high sits around $123,000 on major benchmarks‚Äîan extension of 2025‚Äôs institutional-heavy advance‚Äîso calling $112,000 a ‚Äúprevious ATH‚Äù refers to the nearer-term breakout plateau that preceded price discovery, not the absolute record. That nuance is why Maartunn concludes with a conditional: ‚ÄúSo far this cycle, we haven‚Äôt seen any previous ATH break down‚Ä¶ Until that changes, this looks like a normal pullback. But if we do break below a former ATH ($112k), that‚Äôs a real shift in market behavior.‚Äù In the near term, the credibility of that ~$108,000‚Äì$112,000 ‚Äúshelf‚Äù will likely be decided by whether supply from profit-taking long-term holders, loss-realizing short-term holders, and ETF redemptions continues to outweigh balance-sheet demand and organic spot inflows. If the shelf holds, Maartunn‚Äôs base case is ‚Äúa normal pullback‚Äù that bleeds off excesses from the ATH push. If it fails decisively, he argues, the cycle would be showing its first meaningful breach of a prior breakout‚Äîan observable change in behavior rather than a narrative turn of phrase.

49663786,550043,1754521257,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49663786.jpeg,Ethereum Under Trump: Exploring 3 Pathways For Impact From New Crypto Policies,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-under-trump-exploring-3-pathways/,"In a recent analysis by The Motley Fool, a private financial and investing advice company based in the US, the implications of President Donald Trump‚Äôs support for the cryptocurrency sector have come under scrutiny, particularly regarding Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Trump has consistently advocated for the crypto industry, surrounding himself with pro-crypto advisors and advancing initiatives such as the establishment of a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. His administration is actively promoting legislation that would establish the United States as a global leader in cryptocurrency. The recent passage of the GENIUS Act , which establishes stablecoins as the foundation of this ongoing change in the country‚Äôs digital asset ecosystem, is a key part of this effort. Trump‚Äôs Crypto Roadmap One significant aspect of Trump‚Äôs crypto policy roadmap is the effort to clarify regulatory frameworks. The lack of clear regulations has long been a concern for businesses and financial institutions operating in the crypto space. Uncertainty about regulatory oversight has led to apprehension regarding enforcement actions, with many stakeholders worried about engaging with the sector. The current administration aims to eliminate these ambiguities by proposing legislation that would assign the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) oversight of the cryptocurrency spot market . This shift would alleviate concerns that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might assert jurisdiction, imposing stringent securities regulations on crypto companies. Recently, the House of Representatives passed the Clarity Act, which seeks to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework, though it still requires Senate approval. Ethereum At The Forefront Another key element of Trump‚Äôs roadmap is the integration of decentralized finance (DeFi) into traditional financial systems. The administration is advocating for legislative measures that recognize the potential of DeFi technologies, which rely on decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. Ethereum‚Äôs blockchain is at the forefront of this movement, according to the firm‚Äôs analysis, serving as the primary platform for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Smart contracts automate various processes, executing agreements when specific conditions are met. For instance, in real estate, a smart contract could streamline mortgage transactions by automatically executing terms once necessary documentation and payments are provided. With over half of all decentralized applications operating on the Ethereum blockchain , an expansion of decentralized finance could significantly boost the use and adoption of Ethereum itself. Additionally, the administration is focusing on stablecoins, a crucial area within the cryptocurrency landscape. Recently signed into law, the GENIUS Act aims to establish a regulatory framework for the integration of stablecoins into broader payment systems. Their appeal lies in the ability to use US Treasury securities as a reserve pool, potentially increasing demand for Treasuries and aiding in the management of national debt. The White House‚Äôs fact sheet emphasizes that the widespread adoption of dollar-backed stablecoins could modernize payment infrastructure, moving the US away from outdated systems. Notably, a substantial portion of stablecoin transactions, especially from leading stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC), occur on the Ethereum network, highlighting its central role in the ecosystem.

DeSoc Launches Viral Presale As Solana and Dogecoin Investors Pile In,https://thecoinrise.com/is-this-the-future-of-social-media-desoc-launches-viral-presale-as-solana-and-dogecoin-investors-pile-in/,"A new wave of investor interest is emerging around DeSoc , a blockchain-based social media platform that is shaking up the status quo with its innovative viral presale. As crypto users seek more meaningful use cases and fresh narratives beyond the usual DeFi cycles, DeSoc‚Äôs approach is striking a chord, especially with investors coming from Solana and Dogecoin. The project isn‚Äôt just another token launch. It‚Äôs setting up the groundwork for a full-on decentralized social media ecosystem, combining content monetization, microtransactions, and governance into one system, all powered by the $SOCS token. At just $0.01 per token and with 12 presale stages, early adopters are getting a first look at what some believe could become crypto‚Äôs answer to Instagram and Twitter. DeSoc: Content Meets Crypto Utility DeSoc‚Äôs real value lies in how it blends familiar social media behavior with tokenized incentives. Through content syndication, users can publish posts directly on DeSoc and have them appear across various platforms, including Instagram, Facebook, X, and TikTok. That cross-platform presence keeps creators visible while giving them token-based rewards for quality content, engagement, or exclusive posts. The platform introduces a reward system for content creators, tipping tools, premium subscriptions, and even micropayments for unlocking certain posts. Users can promote content, donate to causes, and engage in peer-to-peer transactions, all using $SOCS. DeSoc also features tokenized governance, smart contracts for proposal execution, and a transparent API system for seamless integration with existing social networks. The tokenomics support this vision: 45% of the total 3 billion supply is allocated to the new viral presale , 20% reserved for development, 15% for marketing, and 10% each for liquidity and community rewards. Solana‚Äôs Growth Story vs. DeSoc‚Äôs Value Proposition Solana has been on a run. The price recently touched $200 before pulling back to around $181, reflecting a 50% rally over the past month. Its ETF debut raised $100 million in just 12 days , and MetaMask‚Äôs new support for Solana adds another layer of accessibility. On the DeFi side, Solana‚Äôs total value locked is closing in on $10 billion, overtaking BNB in some key areas. Still, the surge hasn‚Äôt gone unnoticed by traders looking for entry points or exit ramps. A common concern is whether Solana‚Äôs price action is sustainable at these highs or whether capital could rotate into lower-cap, utility-driven projects like DeSoc. While Solana‚Äôs ecosystem continues expanding, it largely caters to developers and large-scale projects. By contrast, DeSoc appeals directly to everyday users, creators, and community builders. Dogecoin‚Äôs Latest Updates Spark New Interest Don‚Äôt count Dogecoin out just yet. According to recent chart analysis, DOGE is retesting the neckline of a double bottom formation , typically a bullish pattern. It recently reached a local high of $0.288 before correcting and is now hovering around $0.2388. Buyers are watching closely, with support near $0.235 holding strong. Dogecoin‚Äôs latest updates also highlight a larger truth about the token it still boasts one of the most passionate communities in the crypto space. But while it thrives on memes and culture, it‚Äôs limited in what users can actually do with it. DeSoc, by contrast, offers that same community-driven vibe but adds something Dogecoin lacks: utility. Dogecoin traders seeking the next wave may find DeSoc‚Äôs new viral presale to be a more functional pivot one that still values the community, but also empowers it. The New Viral Presale Worth Your Money Between Dogecoin‚Äôs latest updates and Solana‚Äôs recent price action, it‚Äôs clear the crypto market isn‚Äôt short on excitement. But if the goal is long-term returns rooted in adoption and utility, DeSoc‚Äôs new viral presale stands out. It offers a rare combination: creator monetization, decentralized governance, cross-platform functionality, and user-first economics. If you‚Äôre tired of speculating and want a chance to get in on something with real-world traction, $SOCS may be your best bet this year. The early presale is now live, but at $0.01, it may not remain that low for long. Discover the future of decentralized social infrastructure with DeSoc.

At the time of writing, DOGE is trading around $0.2035, showing signs of consolidation after a turbulent few months. The current setup has some analysts predicting a potential breakout, especially if capital continues rotating out of large caps like Bitcoin and Ethereum and into more speculative assets. Emerging altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE have also entered the conversation. With momentum mirroring early-stage success stories like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, the project is attracting investors hoping to secure ground-floor positions before potential exchange listings. Solana‚Äôs Capital Rotation Could Trigger DOGE Rally One of the major forces pushing attention back toward Dogecoin is the recent rotation of liquidity within the altcoin space. As seen with Solana‚Äôs sharp rise and subsequent pullback, traders are clearly reallocating funds based on short-term momentum and long-term narratives. DOGE, still one of the most recognizable cryptocurrencies globally, is benefiting from this environment. If current trends continue and investor appetite grows during the next altcoin cycle, some price forecasts suggest DOGE could aim for $0.50‚Äì$1.00 by 2026‚Äîespecially if market sentiment remains strong and retail participation increases. Why Investors Are Watching This New Altcoin Closely While meme coins like Dogecoin have historically offered explosive upside, the real buzz is now shifting toward MAGACOIN FINANCE. The project has been gaining massive traction thanks to its limited presale access and strong community backing. Traders are now speculating MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver a 38x gains , potentially outperforming legacy meme coins during the next rally. What‚Äôs drawing comparisons to Solana‚Äôs early days is its rapidly growing ecosystem and timed market entry‚Äîright as capital is flowing potentially high-reward assets. What Could Fuel DOGE‚Äôs Next Big Move Several factors could set the stage for a new Dogecoin rally: Retail-driven momentum: DOGE remains a favorite among social media traders and retail investors. Celebrity attention: Any renewed buzz from high-profile figures could reignite interest. Altcoin cycle timing: The next market-wide rally could shift capital into high-volatility assets like DOGE. Exchange upgrades and adoption: Increased integration and use cases could boost long-term value. Whale accumulation: If larger holders return, it could signal a stronger bullish trend ahead. Could DOGE Hit $1? While reaching $1 would require a significant rally, it‚Äôs not entirely out of the question‚Äîespecially if Dogecoin captures enough momentum during the next altcoin season. That said, the market is evolving, and many investors are now looking beyond traditional meme coins. The growing attention around MAGACOIN FINANCE, especially with projections of 38x returns , underscores how investor behavior is shifting toward newer, faster-moving opportunities.

Analysts now have their eyes on three top-notch projects that offer more than hype: Avalanche (AVAX), Solana (SOL), and DeSoc (SOCS) . Each of these altcoins brings something unique to the table, be it super-fast smart contracts, a growing dApp ecosystem, or going big on decentralized social infrastructure. With real-world utility, developer adoption, and growing communities backing them, these altcoins are being described as the top cryptos to invest in now by retail and institutional voices alike. Let‚Äôs dive into the numbers and why these three are causing a splash in 2025. AVAX has Resisted Despite the Price Drop Avalanche , at other times praised for its speed and scalability, now trades at $23.39, down by 6.45% over the last 24 hours. Its market cap is $9.87 billion, trading volume of $890.5 million, which went down somewhat by 1.62%. Despite this fall, AVAX is still a force to be reckoned with in the smart contract arena. The subnet architecture of the protocol allows developers to deploy extremely flexible blockchains tailored for specific applications, from gaming to DeFi. With institutional buying picking up steam and consistent updates on the roadmap, Avalanche is still a low-gas-fee cryptocurrency with long-term prospects. Solana‚Äôs Strength Keeps It In The Top Tier Solana (SOL) , the erstwhile ‚ÄúEthereum killer,‚Äù was trading at $184.52, a 6.79% dip in the last twenty-four hours. Its market cap is still at $99.48 billion, with trading volume showing a 14.1% increase to now at $11.49 billion. SOL remains standing tall for its extremely fast transaction times and ridiculously low fees and is quickly becoming the chain of choice for NFT portals, GameFi platforms, and scalable DeFi applications. The recent drop is regarded by analysts as a much-needed correction and not something to be worried about, especially as Solana-based projects continue to go strong. Still, for those who are looking for the next 100x crypto, there are others peering elsewhere to a new star by the name of DeSoc. DeSoc: The Viral Social Layer Web3 Desperately Needs While AVAX and Solana are scaling transactions, DeSoc is scaling something arguably much bigger: social identity and reputation across the decentralized web. DeSoc (Decentralized Social) fuels a unified identity layer for Web2 and Web3. From Farcaster to Twitter and Lens, the SOCS token enables users and devs to sync identity, build trust, and monetize influence across platforms. The SOCS token is now in presale, but it‚Äôs already made waves with over $10 million raised in just over a week, with pundits calling it the best altcoin to buy today for those planning ahead for 2025. What‚Äôs behind the DeSoc buzz? Decentralized identity across numerous platforms SOCS token used for staking and voting APIs for creating social tools that developers will love Reputation tracking and monetization of content Over $10 million raised, and early-bird rewards are live Whereas AVAX and Solana are taking care of the infrastructure needs at the base level, DeSoc is targeting what is missing: the people layer. In a global ecosystem where developers, influencers, and creators survive on social identity and trust, DeSoc can be the glue that holds the Web3 world together. Final Take: Balance The Present With The Future AVAX and Solana have already proven themselves, delivering reliability and scale to Web3 today. But if you want to know where the next wave of growth and innovation will arrive from, DeSoc has a compelling case. Its social-first design takes advantage of one of Web3‚Äôs most valuable assets: reputation. Add to this its developer-focused stack and user demand accelerating at an alarming speed, and it‚Äôs little wonder that SOCS tokens are vanishing fast from presale.

49662610,https://timestabloid.com/?p=77161,1754523037,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP Price Outlook if It Captures 10% of Global Real Estate Transactions,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-price-outlook-if-it-captures-10-of-global-real-estate-transactions/,"XRP is currently trading at $3.00 with a market capitalization of approximately $177.9 billion. Despite recent market fluctuations, the token has recorded a 38% increase in value this year and a notable 480% surge since November 2024. Even with this significant upward trend, several market analysts continue to suggest that XRP‚Äôs current valuation does not fully reflect its potential. A key argument supporting this view is the increasing adoption of XRP as a bridge currency for global payments. One area where this function could be expanded is the real estate sector, particularly in facilitating cross-border property transactions. As international property sales continue to grow, the question arises: What could XRP be worth if it became a key settlement tool in this domain? Global Real Estate Volume and XRP‚Äôs Hypothetical Role In 2024, the global real estate market, encompassing both residential and commercial transactions, reached a total volume of $703 billion , representing a 14% year-over-year increase. Of this, the Americas accounted for $372 billion, while the EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) region recorded $199 billion. The Asia-Pacific region contributed $131 billion. Activity intensified in the fourth quarter of the year, during which deal volume alone reached $232 billion. In a hypothetical model, if XRP were to facilitate the entirety of these cross-border property transactions, it would need to function as both a transactional intermediary and a temporary store of value. In this scenario, financial institutions, real estate firms, and investors would rely on XRP to enhance the speed and efficiency of international settlements. This would require deep liquidity and sustained demand, likely leading to upward pressure on its market value. Projected Valuations Based on Market Integration To estimate XRP‚Äôs potential price in this hypothetical context, a capital multiplier model was applied. In crypto markets, the market cap of an asset can expand significantly beyond the nominal capital inflow due to increased demand and limited supply. Multiplier effects typically range from 5x to 15x but may rise further in highly bullish market conditions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A multiplier of 10x was applied to the $703 billion in global real estate transactions, resulting in a projected market capitalization of $7.03 trillion for XRP. Given its current circulating supply of 59.3 billion tokens, this scenario implies a token price of approximately $118.55. For a more conservative estimate, a 5x multiplier was also considered. Under this model, the projected market cap would be $3.515 trillion, leading to a token price of $59.3. Even in this restrained case, XRP‚Äôs price would increase almost twentyfold from its current value. While it is unlikely that XRP will fully dominate the global real estate transaction landscape in the near term, partial adoption could still have a meaningful impact on its valuation. Should XRP capture even 5% to 10% of the annual global property transaction volume, its value could reasonably increase to a range between $6 and $12. This analysis presents a speculative but data-driven assessment of how XRP‚Äôs utility could extend beyond traditional financial remittances into larger and more complex sectors such as real estate. Although full integration remains hypothetical, the potential for growth underscores XRP‚Äôs relevance in broader financial infrastructure.

As meme coins blow up and Layer 1s struggle with congestion wars, there‚Äôs one project that‚Äôs rewriting the playbook quietly, and investors are snapping up on it fast. Say hello to DeSoc , the decentralized social identity platform that has already hit over $10 million in weeks, one of the best crypto presales to invest in today. Backed by a solid use case, expert credibility, and a growing base of believers, DeSoc is not just a coin. It‚Äôs the connective tissue Web3 has lacked. What Is DeSoc and Why Is It Booming? Short for ‚ÄúDecentralized Social,‚Äù DeSoc is solving one of crypto‚Äôs most important problems: fractured identity. Today, your identity on X (Twitter), Farcaster, Discord, or Lens exists in separate silos. DeSoc tackles that by unifying identity, social credibility, and influence across Web2 and Web3. Developed with creators, developers, and communities in mind, the SOCS token is for staking, governance, and powering the tools that make decentralized reputation possible. Here‚Äôs why analysts are so hot on it: One Identity Layer for Web2 and Web3 Developer APIs to build social tools and platforms Staking rewards and governance are built in Creator monetization through social reputation metrics Raised over $10M, with a presale that‚Äôs red hot in seconds If you slept on early Ethereum or Solana, DeSoc might be your second chance at a high-utility gem before it becomes mainstream. Experts Say It Ticks All The Right Boxes Analysts are already referring to DeSoc as one of the next 100x crypto projects, and rightly so. It sits at the intersection of multiple popular narratives: decentralized identity, social finance (SoFi), creator tools, and Web3 reputation. Even better? It‚Äôs live and currently under construction, not just a roadmap fantasy. In a space that‚Äôs too rich in speculation, DeSoc brings actual use-case utility: Synchronize identity across platforms Boost trust with on-chain reputation Developers can build using friendly APIs Token utility includes staking, governance, and creator rewards Growing quickly with smart early adopters $10 Million Raised and Growing DeSoc‚Äôs presale is blazing. Collecting well over $10 million in just weeks, early investors are racing to buy tokens before the next price level. The team also hinted at a series of high-profile partnerships, alongside an imminent testnet integration and dApp builder tools, which could open the door to thousands of apps supported by DeSoc‚Äôs identity platform. Early adopters get limited-time perks, so the timing is ideal to join now. Why DeSoc Trounces Other Presales Let‚Äôs be real, most presales these days are either memecoin or mysterious whitepaper hype. DeSoc isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs founded on Web3‚Äôs biggest requirement: verifiable identity and trust. It‚Äôs not a token with ambitions of being the next Dogecoin. It‚Äôs infrastructure. It‚Äôs designed for a purpose. It‚Äôs what Web3 has been missing. With the SOCS token powering the whole platform, early adopters are poised to ride along as growth persists, and in light of the $10 Million+ having been raised, it seems that they won‚Äôt be riding solo. Final Thought: Get In While It‚Äôs Early The presale window is still open, but it won‚Äôt be around forever. With its strong foundations, growing developer interest, and clearly articulated roadmap, DeSoc is quickly becoming the savvy investor‚Äôs best option for long-term returns.

49663028,https://thecoinrise.com/xrp-news-today-ripple-drops-below-3-as-investors-show-interest-in-new-defi-social-media-platform/,1754523611,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/49663028.jpeg,XRP News Today: Ripple Drops Below $3 As Investors Show Interest In New DeFi Social Media Platform,https://thecoinrise.com/xrp-news-today-ripple-drops-below-3-as-investors-show-interest-in-new-defi-social-media-platform/,"XRP has been a constant in the crypto universe for quite some time, with praise for its application in cross-border payments and victory in court over the SEC. Yet even traditional tokens are not exempt from investor mood swings. As of now, XRP has dipped below $3 , now selling at $3.10, a decline of 9.92%, though it recorded an astronomical 146.97% increase in day-to-day trading volume to more than $17.19 billion. So what‚Äôs going on? Yes, part of the decline can be attributed to profit-taking and market fluctuation, but there‚Äôs another trend in play too: investors relocating capital into fresh opportunities, namely, into next-gen DeFi social platforms like DeSoc . What‚Äôs Driven XRP‚Äôs Decline Despite Ripple‚Äôs persistent existence and real-world implementations, XRP has not been immune to overall sell-offs. The recent drop below the psychological $3 level is suspect considering the surge in trading volume, which typically signals either whale activity or bulk redemptions. Analysts suggest the following could be at play: Profit-taking following XRP‚Äôs recent rally over $3.30 Soliciting investor interest in more revolutionary altcoins Rotation within the market from old-school tokens to presale-stage ventures FOMO in new spaces such as decentralized identity and DeFi social This is not necessarily terrible news for XRP long-term, but short-term sentiment very much indicates retail and early adopters are searching for the next breakout. DeSoc: The Web3 Social Layer That‚Äôs Turning Heads Whereas XRP stumbles under the pressure of price, a new challenger is stepping into the limelight. DeSoc Decentralized Social is becoming the Web3 identity layer, uniting users on social platforms, chains, and communities. It‚Äôs a purpose-built project for the post-X (Twitter) world, where decentralized influence, on-chain trust, and creator ownership are more critical than ever. And the stats don‚Äôt lie: Raised over $10 million in its current presale SOCS token facilitates governance, staking, and developer functions Massive adoption by developers, influencers, and Web3 creators Cross-platform identity mapping from Web2 to Web3 Reputation rewards, not speculation In a nutshell, DeSoc is social media reimagined for crypto, and interest is high. Why Investors Are Flocking to DeSoc The crypto world is no longer satisfied with passive investment. What they are looking for now is utility, community, and upside potential, and DeSoc delivers all three. Here‚Äôs how it‚Äôs grabbing attention: Cross-chain social identity on dApps, DAOs, and Web2 Creator economy with reputation-based incentives Developer-friendly APIs for building new dApps and social tools SOCS staking with passive income and governance impact Staggering early traction with over $10M raised For investors who missed out early on Solana or Arbitrum, DeSoc is a do-over, better vision to boot. From XRP to DeSoc: Is This a Strategic Shift? Not only are XRP holders selling, but they‚Äôre strategically moving into altcoins with a definite roadmap and strong user base demand. DeSoc is not competing with Ripple‚Äôs payment rails, but it‚Äôs fixing a larger problem in the crypto ecosystem: Who do you trust online and how do you prove it? By offering portable digital identities that contain social trust and sway, DeSoc becomes infrastructure for Web3, and not just a token. Last Take: Is Time to Diversify? XRP is not going away. But its recent decline shows even top-shelf cryptos need more than hype to sustain the momentum. Conversely, DeSoc is offering something XRP can‚Äôt: an entirely new utility layer for the decentralized internet. As the presale continues to gain traction, early investors are locking in before the next wave of growth. If you‚Äôre exploring high-utility altcoins and want exposure to the growing DeFi + Social intersection, DeSoc may just be your smartest next move.

49663628,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=780683,1754524023,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/49663628.jpeg,Tim Cook joins Trump at White House for Apple investment announcement,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/apple-pledges-100b-for-us-manufacturing/,"Apple is adding $100 billion to its U.S. manufacturing plans following a closed-door meeting between Tim Cook and President Donald Trump at the White House on Wednesday. This comes as the company tries to protect its core product line from a new wave of tariffs and stay on the administration‚Äôs good side while still depending heavily on overseas factories. Trump is expected to personally announce Apple‚Äôs new pledge at the White House event where Cook will also be present. The plan involves setting up a new domestic manufacturing program to pull more of the company‚Äôs supply chain into the U.S. This includes building and assembling more critical components locally to avoid new trade penalties. It adds to Apple‚Äôs earlier promise of $500 billion, which covered projects like a server manufacturing site in Houston, a supplier training center in Michigan, and more money flowing to existing American vendors. With this new pledge, Apple‚Äôs total investment in the U.S. now stands at $600 billion. Trump raises tariffs while Apple tries to hold ground White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers tied the new investment directly to Trump‚Äôs economic goals, saying: ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs announcement with Apple is another win for our manufacturing industry that will simultaneously help reshore the production of critical components to protect America‚Äôs economic and national security.‚Äù Apple‚Äôs stock rose 6% on Wednesday after the pledge, which is its biggest intraday gain since February. Meanwhile, Trump also signed an executive order adding another 25% tariff on goods from India in response to its Russian oil purchases, in addition to a separate 25% duty already scheduled to hit the next day. Apple‚Äôs major reliance on India for iPhone assembly makes it a direct target. Trump has repeatedly pushed Apple to move full iPhone manufacturing to U.S. factories. Earlier this year, after a meeting with Cook, Trump threatened a 25% tariff if the company didn‚Äôt act. While officials have floated ideas like robotics for U.S. assembly, Cook has focused more on securing tariff exemptions. He did this successfully during Trump‚Äôs first term and has been working to do it again. Last week, during a call with analysts, Cook admitted that ‚Äúthe vast majority‚Äù of iPhones sold in the U.S. are still made in India. He added that other products such as MacBooks, iPads, and Apple Watches come from Vietnam. ‚ÄúWe obviously try to optimize our supply chain,‚Äù Cook said. ‚ÄúAnd ultimately, we will do more in the United States.‚Äù Cook also said Apple took an $800 million hit from tariffs in the last quarter and expects that number to rise to $1.1 billion by the end of September unless there are changes in trade policy. That pressure is only increasing. Trump is now preparing to target all products with semiconductor chips with new levies, which could drop as soon as next week. He‚Äôs also expanding country-specific tariffs that will hit dozens of trade partners on Thursday. Trump‚Äôs track record with Apple shows a pattern. During his first term, Cook managed to get several of Apple‚Äôs products exempted from import duties. If he can pull that off again, it could help Apple avoid price hikes that would squeeze its margins, or worse, give competitors like Samsung a pricing advantage. The initial $500 billion commitment Apple made in February included a promise to add 20,000 jobs, but the numbers weren‚Äôt much beyond its previously announced plans. That pledge only added $39 billion and around 1,000 jobs per year. The extra $100 billion is meant to reinforce its U.S. ties ahead of a broader trade crackdown. The Apple news fits into a string of public investment rollouts from the Trump administration. Earlier this year, Trump hosted a joint announcement with Oracle, SoftBank, and OpenAI, revealing a $100 billion investment in AI data centers with plans to hit $500 billion. Separately, Trump said Nvidia plans to manufacture up to $500 billion in AI infrastructure inside the U.S. through new partnerships. The White House has also linked trade deals directly to investment promises. In an agreement with the European Union, Trump secured $750 billion in American energy exports and $600 billion in U.S. investments. A similar deal with Japan led to a $550 billion investment fund targeting American projects.

Investors Rush To New Viral Social Media Altcoin,https://thecoinrise.com/dogecoin-latest-news-could-doge-hit-1-in-2025-investors-rush-to-new-viral-social-media-altcoin/,"Dogecoin is again at the forefront of crypto investors‚Äô minds, with people wondering if this meme token is about to penetrate the long-awaited $1 price point in 2025. After all, this token formed through a community of believers has taken a few more than a few by surprise before. But while some HODLers bet even larger on DOGE, a new trend is forming: investors are setting their sights on a fresh Web3 altcoin that combines DeFi and social media DeSoc . Let‚Äôs get into where DOGE stands today and why this fresh new project is generating so much excitement from meme coin fans. DOGE Drops, But Volume Skyrockets: Can $1 Still Happen? Dogecoin itself sits at $0.2378, down 7.19% in the last 24 hours. Although it did dip, volume has spiked up 72.72%, reaching $5.46 billion, showing DOGE is nowhere near the back burner. Its cap is solid at $35.74 billion, making it well within top crypto valuables. But can it get to $1 in 2025? Experts are split. DOGE has demonstrated its ability to come back strong on social sentiment, influencer backing, and macro trends. But a full dollar will take more than good vibes; it‚Äôll require substantial network growth, utility adoption, and a favorable market cycle. Still, as long as it‚Äôs Elon Musk‚Äôs meme sweetheart and a means of payment in his world, DOGE will never cease to amaze. The Shift to New Tales: Why Meme Coin Investors Turn to DeSoc Dogecoin and Shiba Inu started as jokes, but they built communities so strong that full ecosystems were created. Nowadays, that same community-based might is spreading to projects that blend social value with real crypto utility. Meet DeSoc , a brand-new altcoin trending viral for all the wrong reasons, that is, not because of memes, but because it‚Äôs revolutionizing Web3 identity and decentralized social platforms for good. Here‚Äôs what DOGE holders are jumping in for: Utility-based demand in the next bull cycle Potential for early entry with explosive returns Top-of-mind resonance with decentralized, open-source philosophies Crypto-native social applications that reward influence and trust DOGE cleared the way for DeSoc to operate, and meme fanatics are already hoarding. What Is DeSoc? The DeFi Social Coin Making Waves DeSoc isn‚Äôt a token; it‚Äôs a social infrastructure layer of the decentralized web. It‚Äôs designed to link digital identities between wallets, chains, and platforms, solving a massive problem in crypto: identity fragmentation. Some of the main features are: On-chain social reputation mapped across dApps SOCS token-based governance, rewarding real engagement Simple-to-use APIs for devs to construct social dApps DeFi x Social integration, staking, and reputation-based rewards Over $10 million raised in a viral presale DeSoc is not looking to replace DOGE it‚Äôs developing a whole new lane for crypto adoption. It‚Äôs where utility, influence, and reward meet. DOGE to DeSoc: The Evolution of Community Power What Dogecoin demonstrated is that a strong, passionate community can fuel exponential growth. But whereas DOGE is built on culture and support, DeSoc is building a protocol on the same power, giving it shape, function, and scalability. Meme coin holders know better than anyone the strength of narrative. Now they‚Äôre applying that knowledge up front in efforts such as DeSoc, where value is derived from participation, not speculation. Last Word: Two Tokens, One Direction? Dogecoin can be said to still be an outsider for the $1 mark, especially with its massive trading volume and community backing in the market. And in looking for ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs next,‚Äù most expect the likes of DeSoc , which has something DOGE lacks, an ability to assist in mainstreaming the future of decentralized identity and shape. Be you meme warrior or a utility maxi, 2025 can be the year of both DOGE and DeSoc, both prospering, just differently. Discover the future of decentralized social infrastructure with DeSoc.

Optimism price prediction for 2028 suggests the token could reach a maximum value of $11.14. In 2031, OP tokens will range between $27.9 and $33.66, with an average value of $28.88. Optimism‚Äôs (OP) commitment to innovation is highlighted by its support for Layer-3 solutions. These solutions enable the development of decentralized applications (dApps) on top of Layer-2 chains, contributing to the expansive Optimism Superchain. The platform‚Äôs initiatives, including introducing custom gas tokens and Plasma mode aimed at reducing onboarding and operational costs, make it more accessible for new users and developers. As the market closely watches the price movements and growth trajectory of the token, can Optimism reach $10 soon? Let‚Äôs get into the OP price prediction for 2025 ‚Äì 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Optimism Token OP Price $0.6681 Market Cap $1.17B Trading Volume $161.74M Circulating Supply 1.75B OP All-time High $4.85 (Mar 06, 2024) All-time Low $0.4005 (Jun 18, 2022) 24-hour High $0.6758 24-hour Low $0.6423 Optimism price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 9.68% 50-Day SMA $0.6526 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 54 (Neutral) Green Days 20/30 (67%) 200-Day SMA $0.9632 Optimism price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: OP is trading within $0.65-$0.68 range with diminishing volume. Technical convergence suggests a potential breakout, but indicators favour a downside. Optimism 1-day price chart As of August 6, 2025, OP is trading at $0.667 with a modest +0.91% gain, demonstrating resilience after experiencing significant volatility in recent sessions. The daily chart reveals price action oscillating within a defined range, with the middle Bollinger bands currently positioned around $0.715 at the upper boundary and $0.614 at the lower boundary. OPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The recent candle formation shows alternating red and green sessions, suggesting indecision among market participants, while the balance of power indicator at 0.16 hints at slight bullish momentum building beneath the surface. However, the declining OBV trend from 786.33M raises concerns about weakening volume support, which could limit any potential upside breakout attempts and suggests that institutional interest may be waning during this consolidation phase. Optimism 4-hour price chart The 4-hour chart shows OP down -0.30% from recent highs, while the Alligator indicator shows convergence at the $0.667-$0.669 range, indicating a potential directional decision point approaching. OPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The price has been respecting multiple moving average levels, creating a technical standoff where neither bulls nor bears have gained decisive control, and the 24-hour volume of 16.39M appears adequate but not explosive enough to suggest imminent breakout momentum. The CMF reading of -0.03 signals slight money flow weakness, indicating that despite the relatively stable price action, underlying buying pressure remains subdued and smart money may be quietly rotating out of positions. Optimism technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.6660 BUY SMA 5 $0.6856 SELL SMA 10 $0.7116 SELL SMA 21 $0.7412 SELL SMA 50 $0.6526 BUY SMA 100 $0.6913 SELL SMA 200 $0.9632 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.6805 SELL EMA 5 $0.6686 SELL EMA 10 $0.6672 BUY EMA 21 $0.6990 SELL EMA 50 $0.8266 SELL EMA 100 $1.0544 SELL EMA 200 $1.3483 SELL What to expect from Optimism? OP is likely to keep ranging between $0.65 and $0.68, with direction hinging on volume and market sentiment. Weak volume and negative money flow hint at a possible downside break in the coming sessions. Is Optimism a good crypto investment? Optimism (OP) could be a good investment if you believe in Ethereum scaling and the growth of Layer 2 solutions. However, like all crypto, it‚Äôs risky, and its value depends on adoption and market trends. Only invest what you‚Äôre willing to lose! Will OP recover? A recovery is possible, but we fear the overall bearish sentiment makes a short-term rebound unlikely. However, as the market consolidates, we expect reduced volatility, which may lead to a breakout in either direction, depending on market dynamics. Will Optimism reach $10? Yes, Optimism is projected to close up to $10 by 2028. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in its price. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and require unprecedented growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook.

Optimism historic price sentiment Optimism price history by Coingecko OP launched with an initial value of $4.57 on May 31 but dropped sharply in June due to the UST stablecoin de-pegging and LUNA collapse, closing June at $0.5434. It further declined to $0.4147 by mid-July. In August, OP briefly surged above $1.90, but by mid-October, it dropped to $0.70 following the FTX collapse. In Q1 2023, OP surged past $3.00 during a crypto bull run but lost 66% shortly after. A recovery saw it close the year at $3.90. OP saw an eventful 2024, reaching an all-time high of $4.85 in March before sliding below $2.30 by mid-April. After a brief recovery to over $2.90 in May, it entered a bearish phase, trading at $1.82‚Äì$1.96 by July and $1.54‚Äì$1.62 by October. November brought a spark of hope with a peak at $2.60. OP closed December within the range of $1.611‚Äì$2.773. In January 2025, OP peaked at $2.18 but lost momentum, dropping to as low as $0.84 in February.

While other presales wait behind coming-soon tags, BlockDAG (BDAG) puts users in control now. It shows the full setup before listings begin. So far, BlockDAG has raised $363 million, sold more than 24.7 billion coins, and moved into batch 29 with a price of $0.0276. That reflects a 2,660% ROI since batch 1. Still, the limited-time price of $0.0016 offers a major entry point. It allows early buyers to lock in the price before any listing changes happen. For those who want more than a placeholder, and are looking for access to real trading tools before launch, BlockDAG stands out as the most complete option right now. Chainlink (LINK) Chainlink remains a leading tool for bringing off-chain data onto the blockchain. Its Oracle system supports major parts of crypto like DeFi, NFTs, and digital insurance. With support across Ethereum, Solana, and several Layer-2 networks, it powers apps that need price data, sports updates, or weather inputs. As new trends like AI and DePIN grow, Chainlink‚Äôs role as a trusted data link keeps expanding. It‚Äôs already working with major players such as Swift and DTCC, pointing to more real-world use cases for decentralized finance. Though it might not bring fast price spikes, Chainlink is known for steady value and strong utility. It suits those who want exposure to crypto tools that support major apps. For 2025, it remains one of the best crypto to buy in 2025 for steady and useful growth. Mantle (MNT) Mantle is a fresh Layer-2 scaling system that stands on solid ground. It‚Äôs backed by BitDAO‚Äôs large treasury, which controls more than $2 billion in assets. This gives Mantle strong funding and a place among the best-supported Ethereum scaling networks. Unlike projects that rely on short-term interest, Mantle is quietly building long-term solutions for both performance and decision-making. It uses EigenDA for flexible data access and supports builders and liquidity with its native asset. What makes Mantle stand out is how its setup goes beyond paying gas fees. It connects to a larger system of rewards linked to BitDAO. As more apps launch and funds are used, this setup could drive more usage and price movement. In 2025, Mantle offers a powerful setup, making it one of the best crypto to buy in 2025 for structure and potential. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu started as a meme, but now it runs its own blockchain, exchange, and virtual world. Its network includes Shibarium, SHIB: The Metaverse, and ShibaSwap, a platform for trading digital assets. Going into 2025, SHIB is focusing on growing its tools and user control. Shibarium now supports transactions using BONE, and SHIB supply continues to shrink with regular burns, all while more users join the ecosystem. While it began as a meme, SHIB now brings more to the table than many expect. It mixes strong community backing with new features that boost its value. Though riskier than others here, it‚Äôs still one of the best cryptos to buy in 2025 for those aiming at bigger swings and high reward chances. Final Take Picking the best crypto to buy in 2025 means looking at tools, trust, and actual use. BlockDAG checks all the boxes, with a working trading platform and an entry price that gives more room for gains. Chainlink stays strong as the network backbone, Mantle brings funded growth options, and Shiba Inu moves from hype to working systems. Each one fits a different type of goal, but BlockDAG is moving ahead while others are still setting up.

However, despite this increase in on-chain fundamentals, ETH‚Äôs price continues to trade below major resistance levels, raising concerns that bullish momentum may be fading. Ethereum Network Activity Picks Momentum According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor CryptoOnChain, Ethereum‚Äôs daily transaction count ‚Äì highlighted in pink in the below chart ‚Äì has surged to a new ATH of approximately 1,550,000 transactions per day. This sharp increase in daily transactions, particularly noticeable over the past few months, points to intensified on-chain usage and overall network engagement. In addition to transaction count, other metrics also reflect a spike in activity ‚Äì most notably, the number of unique Ethereum addresses. As of August 5, the total number of unique Ethereum addresses stood at 332,122,674, marking an increase of 207,454 new wallets compared to the previous day. While some of these may belong to existing users creating new addresses, the majority likely represent new participants entering the Ethereum ecosystem. Related Reading: Ethereum Rally Not Fueled By Bitcoin Dump, On-Chain Signals Show CryptoOnChain emphasized that despite these bullish on-chain signals, Ethereum‚Äôs price has not followed suit. As shown in the above chart, ETH‚Äôs price ‚Äì highlighted in orange ‚Äì remains subdued, failing to break above prior highs or key resistance zones. This disconnect between rising network fundamentals and lagging price action may indicate that the market is in an accumulation phase, the analyst said. CryptoOnChain further suggested that Ethereum could be setting the stage for a significant bullish breakout, with potential upside targets reaching as high as $5,000. Is ETH Price Headed For A New ATH? In a separate analysis posted on X, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto shared the following ETH monthly chart, noting that the asset is ‚Äúcompressing within a massive monthly triangle.‚Äù According to the analyst, a successful breakout from this pattern could potentially drive ETH toward $8,000. For the uninitiated, the triangle pattern is a chart formation that occurs when price action consolidates between converging trendlines, forming a shape that resembles a triangle. It typically indicates a period of indecision that often resolves with a breakout in the direction of the prior trend, signaling continuation or reversal depending on the context. Related Reading: Is Ethereum Gearing Up for a Major Move? Analysts Split on What‚Äôs Next Another well-known analyst, Gert van Lagen, echoed a similar outlook. He noted that ETH may be positioning for a powerful breakout, with a projected price target of up to $9,000, citing growing technical and fundamental support. Meanwhile, on-chain exchange data also supports a bullish narrative. Over the past two weeks, more than 1 million ETH has been withdrawn from centralized exchanges ‚Äì fuelling speculations about a potential supply crunch. At press time, ETH trades at $3,590, down 1.1% in the past 24 hours.

Investors are already speculating that such a move could reignite an explosive altcoin season‚Äîone that mirrors the massive runs seen during Ethereum and Bitcoin ETF approvals. The excitement is also pushing attention toward lesser-known opportunities, with MAGACOIN FINANCE emerging as a standout contender. Its potential upside has analysts comparing it to XRP‚Äôs 2017 bull market surge. XRP ETF Hype Heats Up After years of legal hurdles, Ripple appears to be on the verge of a breakthrough. Sources close to the matter suggest that discussions with major financial institutions‚Äîincluding BlackRock and Fidelity‚Äîare ramping up, with ETF paperwork likely to follow once Ripple‚Äôs final settlement with the SEC is confirmed. This would mark a huge shift in how institutional investors access XRP and could drive billions in capital into the asset. Historically, similar ETF approvals have triggered steep price rallies. For example, Bitcoin surged over 60% after the spot ETF greenlight earlier this year, and Ethereum saw double-digit gains ahead of its futures-based ETF. XRP‚Äôs price currently sits near $2.45, and many believe the ETF news could push it past its previous all-time high of $3.84. This Altcoin Could Outperform If XRP Ignites the Market With attention building around Ripple, smart money is starting to look for altcoins that could ride the ETF wave. That‚Äôs where MAGACOIN FINANCE enters the picture. Analysts say this new project could deliver up to 20,300% gains , thanks to its growing community, real-world use cases , and ongoing development. The presale is gaining traction fast, with early investors already seeing impressive growth. If the XRP ETF unlocks a fresh altcoin rally, MAGACOIN FINANCE could become one of the biggest winners, offering a high-risk, high-reward entry for forward-thinking investors. What Comes Next for XRP and Altcoins? The countdown to August 15, 2025, is critical. That‚Äôs the deadline for Ripple and the SEC to file their joint status update, widely expected to confirm the final terms of their settlement. Once that happens, the regulatory fog over XRP clears‚Äîand so does the path for institutions to enter through ETFs. In the meantime, traders are rotating into altcoins that could benefit from XRP‚Äôs momentum. Ethereum, Cardano, and Solana are all gaining volume, but newer names like MAGACOIN FINANCE are seeing a bigger surge in speculative interest due to their upside potential and low market caps. Conclusion: If Ripple lands its ETF approval, it could mark the beginning of a powerful altcoin season. Historical patterns show that ETF approvals don‚Äôt just boost the coin in question‚Äîthey lift the entire crypto ecosystem. For investors looking beyond the top 10, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a high-ROI investment , with analysts forecasting breakout-level gains should XRP spark the next rally.

49663787,549402,1754524822,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49663787.jpeg,Binance Former Leader Seeks Quick Exit From $1.8 Billion FTX Lawsuit,https://bitcoinist.com/binance-former-leader-seeks-quick-exit-from-1-8-billion-ftx-lawsuit/,"Former Binance CEO Changpeng ‚ÄúCZ‚Äù Zhao has moved to shake off a $1.76 billion clawback bid from the now-bankrupt FTX trust. It‚Äôs a bold opening move. Based on reports, he argues the case should never have landed in a Delaware court. Challenge To Delaware Jurisdiction According to a report , Zhao insists he lives in the United Arab Emirates and has no real ties to Delaware. He points out that the complaint doesn‚Äôt show he‚Äôs ‚Äúat home‚Äù there. His lawyers say the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware lacks power to decide this fight. If the judge agrees, FTX may have to find a new venue or refile elsewhere. Those jurisdiction rules matter when you‚Äôre chasing a humongous amount of money like $1.76 billion. FTX says the money flowed from a share purchase deal in 2021. Binance snapped up those shares just as FTX was heading toward insolvency. Zhao‚Äôs team calls that claim weak. They claim it falls outside US laws because the deal and his actions mostly took place overseas. Fight Over Fraud Claims Based on the motion filed on Monday, Zhao‚Äôs side also questions whether US fraud rules can stretch beyond America‚Äôs borders. He argues that the regulations at issue don‚Äôt apply to someone living in the UAE. Reports have disclosed that he challenged what lawyers call ‚Äúconstructive fraud‚Äù counts. Those counts hinge on federal definitions tied to securities contracts, Zhao‚Äôs filing says. FTX first sued Binance and Zhao back in November 2024. At that time, a Binance spokesperson blasted the effort as ‚Äúmeritless.‚Äù They said the trust was trying to shift blame for FTX‚Äôs collapse onto Binance and its founder. Binance already filed a similar motion to dismiss in May. That earlier paper noted FTX blamed Binance for ‚Äúpervasive malfeasance‚Äù by Sam Bankman-Fried. Weighing The Prior Motions That May motion raised many of the same points now front and center. It highlighted that FTX‚Äôs lawyers pointed to emails and wire transfers routed through US banks. Binance replied that those links aren‚Äôt enough. They argued simple financial messages don‚Äôt create a business ‚Äúpresence‚Äù in Delaware. Sam Bankman-Fried is serving a 25-year sentence for fraud and conspiracy. Whatever happens next, this fight over venue and jurisdiction will set the stage for a long legal battle over who pays for FTX‚Äôs losses. Zhao himself served four months in prison after pleading guilty to US anti-money laundering charges. The Pushback Meanwhile, FTX trust attorneys are expected to push back. They‚Äôll stress that billions of dollars moved through US accounts. They‚Äôll say those wires and phone calls establish jurisdiction under longstanding rules. The court‚Äôs decision on this procedural step could stretch on for months.

As X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram face mounting pressure for censorship, data harvesting, and algorithmic manipulation, blockchain-based alternatives are picking up serious traction. One of the major players in this new space is DeSoc , a new viral altcoin that‚Äôs about to revolutionize the way we socialize, converse, and make money online. While Solana has taken charge in rapid-speed blockchain adoption, experts now believe DeSoc may be up to par not in terms of TPS speed, but in revolutionizing the social aspect of Web3. Solana Dips as Investors Watch the Next Big Thing Solana is currently priced at $186, up 1% in the past 24 hours. Its market cap has a strong hold at $100 billion, with its trading volume up by 14.1% to $11.49 billion, a guarantee that there is action for SOL even during declines. Being one of the most scalable and fastest blockchains, Solana is well sought after for DeFi, NFTs, and meme coins. Even at its pace, however, Solana has failed to solve the social media equation. That‚Äôs where DeSoc is gaining traction, one that isn‚Äôt throughput-based, but trust, identity, and participation. DeSoc: Integrating Social Media, DeFi, and Digital Identity DeSoc is an emerging altcoin project that turns the Web3 experience on its head. Instead of simply storing data or swapping tokens, DeSoc enables individuals to build portable social identities usable in both dApps and blockchains. Here is how DeSoc is different: Decentralized reputation systems tied to wallet activity Interoperable social IDs you own not Big Tech Crypto-native social streams and voting systems Rewards engagement, not speculation Over $10M presale, with virality growing by the day This doesn‚Äôt just make DeSoc a sharing or messaging platform but a foundation layer for the future of digital society. Is DeSoc Able to Compete with Solana? Not in Speed, But in Influence Solana has no equal when it comes to performance metrics, with thousands of transactions per second and negligible gas fees. But while Solana focuses on infrastructure, DeSoc focuses on experience. Web2 social media is algorithm-driven and platform-controlled sites that moderate what people can see, monetize information, and pay advertisers rather than users. DeSoc flips this model on its head by putting users first, paying them, and making them cross-platform transportable. Crypto users no longer accept pumping tokens only. They want networks that give them something, influence, reputation, and community ownership. That‚Äôs DeSoc‚Äôs battlefield. And with meme coin holders, DeFi enthusiasts, and creators all searching for ways to participate and earn better, DeSoc can be among the few projects that can compete with Solana‚Äôs user growth, but from a different angle. Why DeSoc Is Gaining Attention Now Timing is everything in crypto, and DeSoc is riding a few waves: Need for decentralized identity Resistance to Big Tech censorship Cross-chain integration is becoming a requirement Utility in the real world drives altcoin adoption With a token that rewards users and builders, and a presale of over $10 million, DeSoc isn‚Äôt merely riding the social crypto wave; it‚Äôs leading it. Last Take: The Social Layer of Web3 Is Here Solana will remain a crypto behemoth of high-performance infrastructure. Infrastructure needs apps, users, and activity, and that is where DeSoc will thrive. As online communities grow, and identity is the new currency of trust, DeSoc is building perhaps the most impactful layer of Web3 to date. Whether you‚Äôre a creator, investor, or DeFi enthusiast, DeSoc offers a powerful new way to connect, earn, and belong in the crypto space.

Each is moving forward for different reasons. Cold Wallet has passed $5.8 million in its presale, showing potential for a 4,900% return from its current price to launch. Ethereum still leads in DeFi. Solana brings speed and rising volume, while Polkadot connects blockchains through modular tools. These projects range widely in price, from under $0.01 to above $3,622, but each offers something unique. Among them, Cold Wallet takes a different route by focusing on active users instead of future plans. That shift in approach makes it stand out among today‚Äôs top trending crypto to buy options. 1. Cold Wallet: Cashback Model Grows After $270M Deal Cold Wallet‚Äôs presale is now in Stage 16, with CWT priced at $0.00942. Over 645 million tokens are sold, and more than $5.8 million has already been raised. The token‚Äôs confirmed listing at $0.3517 points to a possible 4,900% gain. This growth follows the $270 million purchase of Plus Wallet, adding 2 million users and expanding reach in the self-custody wallet space. Cold Wallet ($CWT) stands out by offering cashback on everyday crypto use like gas, swaps, and transfers. There‚Äôs no staking or lockups involved. The system works within the wallet, providing simple rewards that give it an edge over wallets like MetaMask, which still face complaints about user flow and onboarding. Plus Wallet‚Äôs fast growth since early 2025 showed that ease of use matters. Now Cold Crypto Wallet plans to build on that, combining feedback into one stronger system across the two platforms. The ColdWallet.com domain was valued at only $2 million, which suggests the rest of the deal reflects product strength and real adoption. That level of working utility places Cold Wallet firmly among the top trending crypto to buy for those who value results over hype.. As presale momentum builds and more users migrate, Cold Wallet is shifting from a single app into a larger product ecosystem. 2. Ethereum‚Äôs Upgrades Keep It Strong in a Changing Market Ethereum is still a key part of the blockchain space, with its price near $3,622. As the top smart contract platform, it supports major DeFi apps, NFT sites, and enterprise tools. Backed by strong use and long-term support, Ethereum stays a leading option among the top trending crypto to buy. Its Dencun upgrade helped cut costs and improve network performance, which helps it stay ahead as Layer 2 platforms grow. The move to proof-of-stake has lowered energy use and added a burn system, which slowly reduces the token supply. Ethereum still faces challenges during times of high traffic, but its focus on rollups and Layer 2 solutions is helping to fix that. The network is working toward a more scalable future without losing its leading role. 3. Solana‚Äôs High-Speed Use Grows with Key Partnerships Solana, priced around $168.96, is seeing high demand from fast-moving apps. Its low fees and fast processing make it a top choice for games, NFTs, and memecoins. With more than 20 million daily transactions, its usage continues to grow. Connections with major names like Shopify and Visa give Solana extra weight in the space. The builder community is also active, with over 2,500 developers working on updates and tools. With its strong performance and growing set of features, Solana is often listed as a top trending crypto to buy for users who want speed and live interactions. While past outages raised concerns, recent improvements in network stability have helped rebuild trust in 2025. 4. Polkadot‚Äôs Design Connects Projects Across Blockchains Polkadot trades near $3.65 and is built to run many blockchains in parallel through parachains. This setup makes it great for projects that need speed and cross-chain links. It is becoming a go-to for builders looking for smooth connections between different networks. The developer base is growing, and many teams are testing on Polkadot or bidding in parachain auctions. Its tech is strong, and its focus on easy blockchain links supports its place as a top trending crypto to buy among infrastructure-first developers. Still, Polkadot‚Äôs name isn‚Äôt widely known outside of crypto circles. But new funding and fresh marketing in 2025 aim to fix that, giving the platform a chance to reach more users and builders. One Project Is Gaining the Lead as the Year Moves Forward Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot, and Cold Wallet all offer value in different ways. Ethereum has proven systems, Solana leads on speed, and Polkadot offers smooth chain-to-chain communication. But Cold Wallet is moving quickly. It has raised over $5.8 million in crypto presale 2025 , offers a 4,900% projected return, and completed a $270 million acquisition of Plus Wallet. This mix of momentum, users, and live features is making it stand out. As the end of 2025 gets closer, time to join early projects is running out. For those looking at the next top trending crypto to buy, Cold Wallet‚Äôs progress shows it may be ahead of the curve.

49663811,https://timestabloid.com/?p=77163,1754524856,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP‚Äôs Potential Price Target in a $20 Trillion Crypto Market Cap,https://timestabloid.com/xrps-potential-price-target-in-a-20-trillion-crypto-market-cap/,"As of now, the global cryptocurrency market is valued at approximately $3.7 trillion. XRP remains one of the few digital assets maintaining a substantial market share in this landscape. Currently, XRP holds around 4% of the total market capitalization, with a valuation of $123 billion. In comparison, other notable altcoins trail behind. Cardano represents just 0.63% of the market with a $20 billion capitalization, while Binance Coin (BNB) and Solana account for 2.78% and 2.29% respectively. The leading positions, however, continue to be held by Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the stablecoin USDT. Bitcoin dominates the market with a 64% share, valued at over $2 trillion. Ethereum holds 9%, and USDT represents approximately 5%. Forecasting XRP‚Äôs Potential in a $20 Trillion Market Analysts anticipate that the total value of the crypto market could exceed $20 trillion during the current bullish cycle. Some commentators, including popular voices like Capt Toblerone, have suggested the market could expand even further, to as much as $35 trillion. Assuming XRP maintains its current 4% market share in a $20 trillion crypto market, its capitalization would rise to $800 billion. With a circulating supply of approximately 58.93 billion tokens, this would place XRP at a price of around $13.57 per token. Such a price level would establish a new all-time high for XRP, which has remained below its historical peak for over seven years. Several analysts have predicted that XRP could reach or exceed $13 in this cycle, with some anticipating prices above $20 if adoption and demand continue to increase. Institutional Adoption May Influence Valuation Recent developments have introduced new factors that may support a higher valuation for XRP. Beyond traditional price modeling based on technical analysis and historical data, institutional interest in XRP has grown. The launch of XRP-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and its potential inclusion in corporate treasury strategies suggest that demand from institutional investors may significantly impact the asset‚Äôs price trajectory. If such developments persist, XRP could experience upward pressure beyond what market share analysis alone would predict. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Implications for Other Major Cryptocurrencies Applying the same model to other leading cryptocurrencies yields substantial growth projections. If Bitcoin retains its 64% dominance , its market capitalization in a $20 trillion market would rise to $12.8 trillion, translating to an estimated price of over $644,000 per BTC. Ethereum, maintaining its 9% share, would achieve a $1.8 trillion valuation, crossing the trillion-dollar threshold. Stablecoin USDT would rise to roughly $966 billion. Altcoins such as BNB and Solana would also experience significant gains, with market caps reaching $556 billion and $458 billion, respectively. Cardano, maintaining a 0.63% share, would see its valuation increase to approximately $126 billion. This would place ADA at a projected price of $3.56, approaching its previous all-time high of $3.10. XRP‚Äôs current market share positions it for substantial price growth if the broader cryptocurrency market reaches the projected $20 trillion mark. Provided XRP sustains its share and continues to benefit from institutional interest and ecosystem integration, a price exceeding $13 appears within reach under favorable conditions.

Three altcoins, DeSoc , Avalanche (AVAX), and Solana, are gaining serious traction for very different but equally powerful reasons. From user-owned social platforms to high-speed DeFi ecosystems, these projects are lighting up watchlists everywhere. Here‚Äôs why DeSoc, AVAX, and Solana stand out as explosive buys right now. Avalanche Attracts New Volume As It Eyes $30 Avalanche is steadily rebuilding momentum, positioning itself as one of the most explosive altcoins to watch right now. After a period of sideways movement and macro-driven dips, AVAX is now trading around $23.72, with analysts pointing to a possible breakout. Despite a minor pullback of 1.27% in the last 24 hours, the project holds strong with nearly $900 million in trading volume. Market analyst Ali Martinez highlighted $26 as the key resistance level if breached, Avalanche could trigger a swift rally toward $30 or even $35. Another analyst, CryptoShadow , sees this as part of a larger bullish continuation, not just a temporary spike. Avalanche‚Äôs technicals align with broader bullish sentiment across the market, with renewed buying pressure supporting the case for upside. As Bitcoin steadies and altcoins regain ground, AVAX is following with conviction. The ecosystem is showing signs of renewed activity, drawing attention from traders and long-term investors alike. Avalanche is no longer just recovering, it‚Äôs preparing for lift-off. Analysts Say Solana‚Äôs Chart Looks Ready For More Solana is gaining serious attention once again as it reclaims a strong position above the $200 level. After weeks of choppy trading and sideways movement, the token has broken through key resistance and is now setting up for what many analysts believe could be a major run. With daily volume soaring past $38 billion and its market cap holding steady at over $108 billion, Solana sits confidently in the top five. Analyst ZYN highlighted its breakout above $200 as a pivotal moment, calling the structure ‚Äúclean‚Äù with higher highs and higher lows. Another respected voice, Ali Martinez , pointed out that SOL recently broke out of an ascending triangle, often a signal of steep upside ahead. His next targets range from $300 to $360 if the momentum holds. Meanwhile, meaningful resistance doesn‚Äôt appear until the $260 mark, giving SOL room to run. If buyers remain active, this rally could only be getting started. Among the top altcoins right now, Solana is not just participating it‚Äôs leading. SOCS Token Unlocks A New Era Of Online Monetization DeSoc is quickly emerging as one of the most explosive altcoins to buy right now, not just for its tech, but for its mission. Built on blockchain, DeSoc is taking a direct shot at centralized social platforms by giving power back to users. It‚Äôs not just about content; it‚Äôs about ownership, monetization, and identity.

The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with recent reports of a truly significant event: a massive ETH whale accumulation . Over the past three days, a single entity has amassed an astounding amount of Ethereum, signaling a potentially bullish outlook for the popular altcoin. This kind of substantial Ethereum accumulation by a major player often captures the market‚Äôs attention, leading to widespread speculation about future price movements and market sentiment. What is This Gigantic ETH Whale Accumulation? Recent on-chain data, highlighted by crypto analyst @EmberCN on X, reveals that a prominent whale or institution, operating through a wallet created via BitGo, has made colossal moves in the Ethereum market. This entity has rapidly acquired a substantial volume of ETH, indicating strong conviction in Ethereum‚Äôs value proposition. Recent Inflow: In a span of just 20 hours, the wallet received 27,073 ETH, valued at approximately $97.62 million. This significant inflow immediately caught the eye of market observers. Total Accumulation: Over the last three days, the same entity has accumulated a staggering total of 128,204 ETH. This entire stash is worth around $464.5 million, marking one of the largest single crypto whale movements seen recently. These large-scale transactions were facilitated through several institutional-grade platforms, including FalconX, Galaxy Digital, and BitGo. The involvement of such platforms suggests that this is likely an institutional investor rather than an individual trader. Who is Behind This Institutional ETH Accumulation? While the exact identity of the ‚Äòwhale‚Äô remains anonymous, the use of platforms like BitGo, FalconX, and Galaxy Digital strongly points towards an institutional entity. These platforms are well-known for providing secure and compliant services to institutional clients, including hedge funds, asset managers, and corporations looking to engage with digital assets. BitGo, for instance, is a leading provider of digital asset financial services, specializing in security, custody, and liquidity. FalconX offers institutional prime brokerage services for digital assets, while Galaxy Digital is a diversified financial services and investment management company in the digital asset sector. Their involvement underscores the growing trend of institutional ETH adoption. Why Does This Ethereum Whale Activity Matter? The actions of a crypto whale , especially one engaging in such significant large ETH buys , often serve as a bellwether for market sentiment. When a major holder makes a substantial purchase, it can be interpreted in several ways: Strong Confidence: It suggests that the whale has high conviction in Ethereum‚Äôs long-term potential and believes the current price offers a favorable entry point. Market Influence: Such a large acquisition can influence market dynamics, potentially creating upward price pressure as demand increases. Institutional Interest: It highlights increasing institutional interest in Ethereum, which can bring more stability and legitimacy to the asset class. This level of Ethereum accumulation could signal a shift in market sentiment, potentially encouraging other investors to follow suit. It reflects a strategic long-term play, rather than short-term speculation. What Are the Implications of These Large ETH Buys? The implications of this significant ETH whale accumulation are multifaceted. Firstly, it adds considerable buying pressure to the Ethereum market. When a single entity purchases nearly half a billion dollars worth of ETH, it absorbs a substantial portion of available supply, which can naturally lead to price appreciation if sustained demand follows. Secondly, it reinforces the narrative of Ethereum as a prime asset for institutional portfolios. As more traditional financial players look to diversify into digital assets, Ethereum‚Äôs robust ecosystem, encompassing DeFi, NFTs, and a vast developer community, makes it an attractive option. This particular institutional ETH move could pave the way for more large-scale investments. Finally, it serves as a vote of confidence in Ethereum‚Äôs ongoing developments, such as scalability improvements and the transition to Ethereum 2.0 (now known as the Merge and subsequent upgrades). These technological advancements enhance Ethereum‚Äôs utility and appeal, making it a valuable asset for long-term holding. In conclusion, the recent ETH whale accumulation of $464.5 million in just three days is a powerful indicator of strong institutional conviction in Ethereum. This massive inflow of capital, facilitated by leading institutional platforms, underscores Ethereum‚Äôs growing appeal as a cornerstone digital asset. It hints at a potentially bullish future, as large players position themselves for what they believe will be significant long-term gains. This development truly makes waves in the crypto sea, offering a compelling narrative for Ethereum‚Äôs trajectory. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is an ETH whale? A: An ETH whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of Ethereum, enough to potentially influence its market price through their buying or selling activities. Q2: Why is this specific ETH accumulation significant? A: This accumulation is significant due to its sheer size ($464.5 million) and the short timeframe (3 days), indicating strong conviction and potentially institutional backing, which can signal broader market confidence. Q3: Who is BitGo and why are they mentioned? A: BitGo is a leading digital asset trust and security company that provides institutional-grade custody, trading, and finance solutions. Their involvement suggests that the whale is likely an institutional investor due to the high-security and compliance requirements for such large transactions. Q4: Does this large ETH accumulation guarantee a price increase for Ethereum? A: While a large accumulation often indicates bullish sentiment and can contribute to price appreciation, it does not guarantee a price increase. Cryptocurrency markets are complex and influenced by many factors, including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory news, and overall market sentiment. Q5: How can I track crypto whale movements? A: You can track crypto whale movements using on-chain analytics platforms and blockchain explorers that monitor large transactions and wallet activities. Many crypto news outlets and social media accounts also report on significant whale movements. Did you find this analysis of the recent ETH whale accumulation insightful?

With billions flowing into meme coin projects, the digital asset class, once considered a joke, is now commanding serious attention from traders, influencers, and early adopters. Meme coins have transformed from fringe experiments to top cryptos to join in 2025, offering a rare combination of relatability, market energy, and presale upside that traditional tokens struggle to match. While the buzz centers around familiar names, the real momentum lies in what‚Äôs emerging now. The rising class of meme coins, including MoonBull ($MOBU), Floki ($FLOKI), Brett ($BRETT), and Popcat ($POPCAT), is redefining early-stage opportunity. These tokens have layered tokenomics, communities with viral potential, and accessible price points that invite both new and seasoned crypto investors. 1. MoonBull ($MOBU) MoonBull ($MOBU) is built for Ethereum users and meme coin enthusiasts who are focused on high-velocity gains and smart contract reliability. This token is laser-focused on rewarding early-stage participants through an advanced staking system and mystery token drops. Its DeFi integration gives it structural depth, while its meme branding taps into the viral power of internet culture. MoonBull‚Äôs roadmap is intentionally guarded, revealing insights only to whitelist members. This design rewards those who engage early and adds a layer of exclusivity that intensifies demand. What also makes MoonBull compelling is its Ethereum foundation, which ensures secure, scalable infrastructure for DeFi and token interactions. Here‚Äôs what whitelist members will gain: Access at the lowest token price Unlock secret staking rewards Receive bonus token allocations Get private insights into the roadmap These perks won‚Äôt be shared publicly. Once the allocation fills, that‚Äôs it. No resets, no retries. MoonBull made it to this list of top cryptos to join in 2025 due to its intelligent mix of exclusivity, strong tokenomics, and presale architecture that supports rapid early-stage growth. Learn from Missed Chances: What Hesitation Can Cost Picture an investor scrolling through forums in 2013, dismissing Dogecoin as just another online joke. Or someone briefly considering Shiba Inu before its parabolic rise, only to move on without action. These moments become cautionary tales repeated in hindsight. MoonBull‚Äôs whitelist offers a chance to change that narrative. It represents a rare gateway to early-stage entry ‚Äì before the broader market awakens. While Stage One of the presale will eventually open to all, whitelist members receive private notice of the exact launch time and gain access before the public. The clock is ticking, and for those who understand that timing is everything, this may be the pivotal window that sets a portfolio apart. 2. Floki ($FLOKI) Floki ($FLOKI) gained its initial popularity due to its Elon Musk, but it has since matured into a robust ecosystem with utility and staying power. Its roadmap includes NFT gaming, metaverse expansion, and educational crypto platforms designed for new users. Built on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain, Floki has positioned itself as more than just a meme ‚Äì it‚Äôs a movement. Floki‚Äôs appeal lies in its trifecta approach: entertainment, education, and earning potential. The team has pushed hard into real-world use cases, with recent announcements around DeFi product integrations and community-driven philanthropic initiatives. Investors are drawn to Floki for its unique ability to balance humor and long-term strategy. It continues to build decentralized products, strengthening its case as one of the top cryptos to join in 2025. Floki earned its place on this list for blending meme culture with utility, delivering long-term vision and community leadership that attracts both new and experienced investors. 3. Brett ($BRETT) Brett ($BRETT) is a newcomer that leverages meme virality while integrating advanced token features for serious traders. What sets Brett apart is its dual-token economy and unique burn mechanics that support long-term price action. It thrives on cultural relevance, especially among Gen Z investors who resonate with its branding and storytelling. From limited NFT collections to gamified staking events, Brett is creating an ecosystem that is both fun and functional. The project‚Äôs team has consistently delivered on milestones, increasing confidence in its roadmap. The community behind Brett is rapidly expanding, thanks to creative airdrop campaigns and meme challenges that spread across TikTok and X. This gives it strong viral legs ‚Äì a critical feature for breakout meme coins. Brett is included among the top cryptos to join in 2025 due to its creative burn economy, dual-token design, and cultural magnetism that translates into real market momentum. 4. Popcat ($POPCAT) Popcat ($POPCAT) blends nostalgia and innovation. Inspired by a viral meme, it has evolved into a fully-fledged ecosystem complete with liquidity rewards, staking options, and gamified user interactions. Built on the Solana blockchain, Popcat offers speed, scalability, and very low transaction costs ‚Äì features that new users and day traders appreciate. One of Popcat‚Äôs biggest innovations is its meme-fueled GameFi engine. Users can earn rewards through mini-games, referrals, and content engagement. This model builds long-term user retention and continuous on-chain activity. In a time when attention spans are short and users seek quick ROI, Popcat provides both entertainment and income. Its branding is instantly recognizable, and its ecosystem is simple to navigate. Popcat secured its spot in this list of top cryptos to join in 2025 due to its GameFi integration, strong brand recall, and Solana-based performance that caters to active traders. Conclusion Based on the latest research, the top cryptos to join in 2025 include Moon Bull , Floki, Brett, and Popcat. Each of these projects brings a distinct blend of meme culture, smart tokenomics, and presale opportunity. However, MoonBull‚Äôs live whitelist access makes it the most time-sensitive opportunity among them. Whitelists remain a strategic way for investors to access new markets at rock-bottom prices before public trading drives up value. With MoonBull‚Äôs exclusive Stage One access and early staking rewards only available to whitelisted members, now is the time to act. The world is watching crypto adoption grow. Countries are adding Bitcoin to reserves, institutional players are entering meme territory, and early-stage tokens are offering unheard-of gains. This could be the tipping point for a new crypto wave, and MoonBull is leading the charge. For More Information: Website: https://www.moonbull.io/ Telegram: https://t.me/MoonBullCoin Twitter: https://x.com/MoonBullX FAQs What is the benefit of joining a crypto whitelist like MoonBull‚Äôs? Joining the whitelist gives users early access to tokens at the lowest possible price, plus exclusive rewards and insights that are not made public before launch. How do meme coins generate value beyond hype? Modern meme coins integrate DeFi utilities, staking, and community-based rewards, offering real value alongside viral branding.

Is it safe to join the MoonBull whitelist? MoonBull uses a secure whitelist form and Ethereum smart contracts, offering reliability and transparency for users.

Which Of These Is A Wiser Investment In 2025",https://thecoinrise.com/desoc-ripple-or-cardano-which-of-these-is-a-wiser-investment-in-2025/,"As the crypto market evolves, investors are looking beyond hype and into real-world value. Ripple, Cardano, and the rising star DeSoc each offer something different: payments, infrastructure, and decentralized social media. But which one holds the smartest potential for 2025? Whether you‚Äôre drawn to utility, long-term growth, or user-driven innovation, this breakdown explores which of these three could be the wisest investment this year. XRP Hits Resistance As Analysts Warn Of A Pullback XRP has delivered solid gains in July, jumping over 55% and continuing its five-year streak of closing the month in the green. But recent signals suggest that the momentum may be cooling. The token reached just below its all-time high of $3.80, only to form what analysts now call a double top, a classic sign of potential reversal. Crypto analyst Tradersboat pointed out that XRP has shown signs of buyer exhaustion, along with a Break of Structure, indicating bears may be gaining control. Resistance at $3.60 has held firm, with rejection from that level adding weight to the bearish case. While another short-term push to $3.70 remains possible, the larger setup points to a potential drop below $3.40. Historically, August has been one of XRP‚Äôs weakest months, with the past three years showing an average 12% dip after strong Julys. This pattern might repeat if sentiment shifts. While XRP has strong fundamentals, timing could be critical for new investors deciding between Ripple, Cardano, or a rising player like DeSoc. Cardano‚Äôs Price Weakens But Network Development Stays Strong Cardano is facing renewed pressure after a sharp 15% drop sent its price down to around $0.77. The fall broke through key support zones, triggering stop-losses and sparking concerns of a deeper slide. Investor sentiment has cooled as the SEC paused Bitwise‚Äôs multi-asset ETF, which included ADA. That move, though involving a small allocation, echoed broader regulatory uncertainty now hanging over altcoins. On-chain signals aren‚Äôt helping the case either daily active users have dropped below 40,000, and DeFi TVL has slipped to $382 million. The MACD has flipped negative, and the RSI still leaves room for further downside. If $0.73 doesn‚Äôt hold, some traders expect a test of $0.68 . Yet, beneath the bearish short-term setup, Cardano‚Äôs fundamentals remain quietly strong. The network is still expanding, with over 2,000 active projects, new smart contract upgrades, and Layer-2 innovations like Hydra progressing. It may not be the flashiest right now, but Cardano continues to build. In a long-term portfolio, that development focus could still count for a lot. Why DeSoc Offers More Than Just Social Media DeSoc is quickly standing out as one of the most forward-thinking crypto projects of 2025. Unlike Ripple and Cardano, which are focused on payments and infrastructure, DeSoc is tackling something far more personal: how we communicate, share, and connect online. At its center is the SOCS token, with which DeSoc enables individuals to get the most out of their content, their information, and their digital identity. No more algorithm black boxes. No more data exploitation. Users can publish across platforms like Facebook and Twitter while still owning everything they share. Governance isn‚Äôt reserved for insiders. SOCS holders have real voting power to shape how the platform evolves. Creators will be able to increase their availability, place targeted advertisements, and be rewarded for engaging. Under the hood, DeSoc has already locked team tokens for 2 years and liquidity for 30, which is an indicator of long-term stability. Regular audits and a clear token allocation model build even more trust. While Ripple and Cardano focus on systems, DeSoc focuses on people. If you‚Äôre looking for a crypto investment with real-world use, community power, and long-term growth potential, DeSoc might be the wisest bet in 2025.

This significant eight-point jump from the previous day indicates a notable shift in investor sentiment across the cryptocurrency landscape, moving from ‚ÄòNeutral‚Äô into the ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô zone. What does this heightened sense of optimism mean for your digital asset holdings? What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and Why Does it Matter? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, provided by the software development platform Alternative, serves as a thermometer for the cryptocurrency market‚Äôs emotional state. It ranges from 0 to 100, where 0 signifies extreme fear and 100 indicates extreme greed. This index helps investors understand whether the market is overly fearful (a potential buying opportunity) or overly greedy (a potential correction risk). Understanding this index is vital. When the index shows high market greed , it often suggests that prices might be overextended. Conversely, extreme fear can signal a bottoming out. This tool provides a unique perspective on the collective psyche of crypto participants. Decoding the Shift: From Neutral to Market Greed As of August 7, the index stands at 62, firmly placing the market in the ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô category. This rise from the ‚ÄòNeutral‚Äô zone suggests that optimism is growing, and more participants are feeling bullish about crypto assets. This shift can be a double-edged sword for investors. While increased optimism can fuel further price appreciation, it also carries risks. High levels of market greed often precede market corrections as investors become less cautious. It is essential to remember that sentiment can change quickly, influencing price volatility. How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? The index considers six different factors to arrive at its score, providing a comprehensive view of crypto market sentiment : Volatility (25%): Measures current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Compares current volume and market momentum with average values. Social Media (15%): Analyzes keywords on various social media platforms. Surveys (15%): Polls investors to gauge their sentiment (currently paused). Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Assesses Bitcoin‚Äôs share of the total crypto market cap. Google Trends (10%): Looks at search queries related to Bitcoin. These components collectively paint a picture of prevailing investor sentiment , helping to identify potential market tops or bottoms based on emotional extremes. Understanding Bitcoin Dominance and Its Role Bitcoin dominance is a key factor in the index. It measures Bitcoin‚Äôs market capitalization relative to the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. A rising Bitcoin dominance can indicate that investors are moving towards the perceived safety of Bitcoin, potentially pulling liquidity from altcoins. Conversely, falling dominance might suggest an ‚Äòaltcoin season‚Äô where capital flows into other digital assets. The index uses this metric because Bitcoin often leads the market. Its dominance can signal broader trends and shifts in crypto market sentiment , affecting the overall fear or greed levels across the entire ecosystem. Navigating the Greed Zone: Actionable Insights for Investors When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index shows significant market greed , what should investors consider? This is a time for careful planning rather than impulsive decisions. While the rising sentiment can be exciting, seasoned investors often use periods of extreme greed as a signal to exercise caution. Here are some actionable insights: Review Your Portfolio: Consider rebalancing or taking some profits, especially from highly appreciated assets. Avoid FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out): Do not let the rising sentiment push you into hasty purchases at potentially inflated prices. Conduct Due Diligence: Always research thoroughly before investing, regardless of market sentiment. Set Stop-Loss Orders: Protect your investments from sudden downturns if the sentiment shifts rapidly. Remember, the index is a sentiment indicator, not a definitive buy or sell signal. It serves as a valuable tool to understand the prevailing emotions that drive market behavior. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index reaching 62 and entering the ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô zone highlights a significant shift in the market‚Äôs emotional landscape. While this reflects growing optimism and potentially upward price momentum, it also signals a time for prudence. By understanding the factors that influence this index and exercising disciplined investment strategies, you can better navigate the evolving crypto market sentiment and make informed decisions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does a score of 62 mean on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? A score of 62 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index means the market has entered the ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô zone. This indicates that investors are feeling optimistic and bullish, potentially leading to increased buying activity and higher prices. What factors influence the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The index considers six factors: volatility (25%), market momentum/volume (25%), social media activity (15%), surveys (15% ‚Äì currently paused), Bitcoin dominance (10%), and Google Trends data (10%). Is high greed good for the crypto market? While high greed can signal strong upward momentum, it can also indicate that the market might be overheated. Historically, periods of extreme greed are often followed by market corrections, making it a time for investors to exercise caution. How does Bitcoin dominance affect the index? Bitcoin dominance, which measures Bitcoin‚Äôs market share, is a key factor. A rising dominance can suggest investors are consolidating into Bitcoin, while a falling dominance might indicate a shift of capital into altcoins, both influencing overall market sentiment. Should I invest when the index shows ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô? The index is a sentiment tool, not an investment advisor. While ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô indicates optimism, it‚Äôs wise to be cautious. Consider rebalancing your portfolio, taking profits, and avoiding impulsive decisions driven by FOMO. Always conduct your own research.

Despite past rallies, retail sell-offs, weak technicals, and heavy whale dominance are holding DOGE back. Meanwhile, a new viral altcoin is rewriting the script, soaring 400% in just days. As investors chase real innovation and growth, Dogecoin may struggle to keep up in this new market cycle. Dogecoin Slides Again As Whales Keep Buying And Retail Keeps Selling Dogecoin is once again losing steam, dropping over 4% after last week‚Äôs brief 37% rally. The excitement that pushed DOGE higher has faded fast, and retail sentiment remains firmly on the sidelines. While whales continue to accumulate, with over 122 billion DOGE now in their hands, smaller holders are still offloading. Retail selling has persisted since early July, and new participants haven‚Äôt replaced the exit. This imbalance is weighing heavily on the price. Market data from Coinglass confirms the trend: trading volume is down nearly 47%, and open interest has dropped to $4.85 billion. Technicals paint a grim picture, too. DOGE trades below all major moving averages, including the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day, each reinforcing downward pressure. The MACD is deep in the red, and any small rally attempts are quickly overwhelmed by larger selloffs. Despite heavy whale support, DOGE continues to struggle with strong resistance levels and a lack of new retail enthusiasm. Analysts now question whether Dogecoin can ever realistically approach $1. It‚Äôs not just about memes anymore; market structure and momentum say otherwise. Without fresh retail demand and under consistent resistance, DOGE‚Äôs path to $1 is becoming harder to imagine. Meanwhile, a new altcoin is stealing the spotlight with a 400% surge, raising fresh questions about where retail energy is heading next. DeSoc Could Be The Viral Altcoin That DOGE Never Became While Dogecoin struggles to find upward momentum, a new altcoin is quietly building massive traction. DeSoc (SOCS) is capturing attention with its decentralized approach to social media, something traditional platforms have failed to deliver. A 2023 study found that 64% of Americans believe social media companies control the news too much. DeSoc takes this seriously, using blockchain to return control to users and protect their data. It‚Äôs not about memes or hype; it‚Äôs about transparency, fairness, and real utility. The team behind DeSoc has locked their tokens for two years and secured a 30-year liquidity lock, moves that signal a serious long-term vision and market stability. Unlike projects that focus solely on price action, DeSoc backs its mission with multiple security audits, with one already completed and more scheduled. This shows clear dedication to protecting investors and users alike. Its user-friendly design features customizable profiles, integrated wallets, and AI-powered content recommendations, all while safeguarding privacy. However, unlike Dogecoin, which has no real utility, DeSoc has a real-life use case. It is a platform where user ownership, the safety of data, and free speech are the primary concerns. With token distribution fully transparent and early access already generating buzz, DeSoc is shaping up to be the altcoin that doesn‚Äôt just ride a wave it builds one.

Meme coins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and PEPE are once again in focus‚Äîbut investors are starting to reassess where the real upside lies. In the midst of this shift, MAGACOIN FINANCE has caught the attention of high-level crypto traders, with some whales positioning early for what they believe could be a major 31x breakout. Meme Coins Are Back ‚Äì but for How Long? Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading around $0.00001220, while PEPE sits slightly lower at $0.00001046. Despite strong communities, both are struggling to regain momentum seen during previous bull runs. Dogecoin (DOGE), the original meme coin, is holding near $0.2044 but has shown signs of slowing down after a recent rally sparked by broader crypto gains. Many investors are now looking for fresh momentum plays‚Äîprojects that combine meme culture with real tokenomics, scalability, and long-term development. That‚Äôs where emerging altcoins are stepping into the spotlight. Why This Hidden Gem Is Drawing Whale Interest With capital flowing out of stagnant meme coins, MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming the go-to pick for investors looking ahead. Unlike projects stuck in hype cycles, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building an ecosystem that rewards early holders, offers deflationary mechanics, and has a clear roadmap backed by strong community engagement. Analysts are watching closely as whales enter during this early window, forecasting potentia l gains of 31x or more as retail demand begins to build. $500 invested now could realistically turn into $15,500 , according to current price projections‚Äîassuming similar momentum to other early-stage altcoin breakouts. What Comes Next for SHIB, PEPE, and DOGE? Shiba Inu‚Äôs ecosystem developments‚Äîincluding Shibarium‚Äîhaven‚Äôt yet moved the price significantly. PEPE remains highly volatile and speculative, with limited upside unless volume spikes drastically. Meanwhile, DOGE benefits from its name recognition, but many believe its days of 100x moves are behind it. That‚Äôs why investors are rotating into new territory, seeking smaller caps with bigger upside potential. Conclusion Altcoin season is in full swing, but the rules have changed. Traders aren‚Äôt just chasing hype‚Äîthey‚Äôre looking for what‚Äôs next. While SHIB, PEPE, and DOGE still hold nostalgia value, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are commanding attention for their growth potential and strategic entry points. With whales now circling and early backers projecting 31x gains , this could be the golden opportunity of the summer.

The cryptocurrency world is always in motion, and understanding its shifts is key to navigating its often-volatile waters. Recently, a significant indicator, the Altcoin Season Index , has captured the attention of many. This crucial metric, tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), recently registered a value of 36. This figure, down from previous days, signals a clear shift: the crypto market is currently experiencing what is known as Bitcoin Season . What Does the Altcoin Season Index Really Tell Us? The Altcoin Season Index is more than just a number; it is a snapshot of the broader cryptocurrency landscape. It helps investors understand whether altcoins (any cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin) are outperforming Bitcoin or vice versa. This index, which carefully excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens, compares the 90-day performance of the top 100 coins listed on CMC against Bitcoin. An index score ranging from 1 to 100. Altcoin Season : Occurs when at least 75% of the top 100 altcoins outperform Bitcoin over the past 90 days. Bitcoin Season : Indicated when 25% or fewer of these altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin. With the index now at 36, it strongly suggests that Bitcoin has been the dominant performer, leading the current market trends . Why Are We Seeing Bitcoin Season Now? The shift to Bitcoin Season is a natural part of the cryptocurrency cycle. Bitcoin often acts as a bellwether for the entire crypto market . When uncertainty rises or institutional interest focuses on established assets, capital tends to flow back into Bitcoin. This strengthens its position relative to altcoins. Several factors can contribute to this phenomenon: Market Stability Seeking : Investors often view Bitcoin as a safer haven during periods of high volatility or macroeconomic concerns. Dominance Cycle : Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements frequently dictate the overall direction of the market, influencing altcoin performance . Liquidity Concentration : Larger capital inflows often target Bitcoin first due to its superior liquidity and market capitalization. This dynamic often means that even if altcoins are seeing some gains, Bitcoin‚Äôs gains are comparatively larger, leading to a lower Altcoin Season Index . Navigating the Current Crypto Market: What Does This Mean for Your Portfolio? Understanding that we are in Bitcoin Season can help investors adjust their strategies. It is not necessarily a negative signal, but rather an indication of where current capital flows are concentrated. For many, this period might present different opportunities and challenges. Consider these actionable insights: Focus on Bitcoin : If your portfolio is heavily diversified into altcoins, this might be a time to re-evaluate your Bitcoin exposure. Strategic Altcoin Positioning : For those holding altcoins, research projects with strong fundamentals that might weather the Bitcoin Season better or be poised for future growth when the cycle shifts. Risk Management : Periods of Bitcoin dominance can sometimes precede broader market corrections for altcoins, making risk management even more crucial. Monitoring the Altcoin Season Index allows you to make informed decisions based on prevailing market trends . Looking Ahead: Will Altcoin Performance Rebound? The cryptocurrency market is cyclical, and periods of Bitcoin Season eventually give way to Altcoin Season , and vice-versa. While the current Altcoin Season Index suggests Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance, this does not mean altcoins are irrelevant. Historically, altcoins have shown incredible resilience and potential for significant gains once market sentiment shifts or specific narratives emerge. Factors that could signal a return to strong altcoin performance include: Sustained Bitcoin price stability or consolidation. Breakthroughs in specific altcoin projects or ecosystems (e.g., Layer 2 solutions, DeFi innovations). Increased retail investor interest spreading beyond Bitcoin. Keeping an eye on these broader market trends and technological advancements within the altcoin space is essential for long-term success. In conclusion, the Altcoin Season Index at 36 clearly indicates that the crypto market is currently in Bitcoin Season . This phase highlights Bitcoin‚Äôs current strength and influences altcoin performance . While it calls for a strategic approach to your portfolio, remember that market cycles are dynamic. Staying informed about these crucial market trends and understanding what drives them will empower you to make more confident decisions in the ever-evolving world of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index is a metric from CoinMarketCap that tracks whether altcoins (cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin) are outperforming Bitcoin over a 90-day period. It ranges from 1 to 100. Q2: How is Altcoin Season determined? Altcoin Season occurs when at least 75% of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. Q3: What does it mean to be in Bitcoin Season? Bitcoin Season means that Bitcoin has been the dominant performer. This happens when 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days, as indicated by the Altcoin Season Index. Q4: How does Bitcoin Season impact altcoin performance? During Bitcoin Season, altcoins generally see less significant gains compared to Bitcoin, or they may even decline in value relative to Bitcoin. Capital tends to flow more towards Bitcoin as investors seek stability or leadership from the largest cryptocurrency. Q5: Is Bitcoin Season a bad thing for crypto investors? Not necessarily. Bitcoin Season is a normal part of the crypto market cycle. It suggests where the current market strength lies. For investors, it can be a time to consolidate positions, re-evaluate risk, and strategically plan for future shifts back to altcoin dominance. Did you find this analysis helpful?

Market data from CoinGecko shows the total crypto market capitalization currently stands at approximately $3.79 trillion, representing a 0.4% decline in the last 24 hours. This pullback follows a period of uncertainty across major digital assets, with both Bitcoin and altcoins facing limited buying momentum despite periods of volatility. Analysts suggest that reduced market activity and fluctuations in leveraged trading positions are playing a significant role in current market behavior. Insights from Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges globally, highlight shifting trader sentiment as leverage levels decline while overall price movement remains subdued. These changes raise questions about whether the market is entering a phase of consolidation or setting up for more volatility ahead. Related Reading: Bitcoin Inflows To Binance Accelerate: Investor Behavior Shifts After Months Of Decline Leverage Trends on Binance Point to Market Reset According to a recent analysis from CryptoQuant contributor Arab Chain, leverage usage on Binance has decreased notably in recent days. The analyst explains that falling leverage is typically a short-term positive indicator as it suggests the exit of overleveraged traders and a reduction in forced liquidations. This can help stabilize price fluctuations and reduce abrupt sell-offs that often trigger sharp market corrections. However, Arab Chain points out that the current scenario differs slightly. Both price levels and leverage ratios have declined simultaneously, indicating that spot market buying has not picked up to offset selling activity. ‚ÄúThe lack of strong demand in the spot market weakens the probability of a rapid recovery,‚Äù the analyst wrote. This trend highlights a more cautious approach from traders, potentially reflecting macroeconomic uncertainties or a wait-and-see attitude ahead of key market developments. The estimated leverage ratio on Binance is considered a critical indicator for short-term sentiment. A high leverage ratio suggests speculative positions are dominating the market, making it more vulnerable to sudden price swings. Conversely, a falling ratio can indicate risk management among traders or widespread liquidations, both of which can temporarily ease volatility. Arab Chain emphasizes that this metric acts as an ‚Äúearly radar‚Äù for potential shifts in market momentum. Altcoin Deposits Signal Increased Trading Activity In a separate analysis, CryptoQuant‚Äôs Maartunn observed a significant increase in altcoin deposits to Binance, with a seven-day transaction count exceeding 45,000, the highest level since late 2024. This surge in activity coincided with Bitcoin‚Äôs recent push above $112,000, suggesting traders are preparing to adjust their positions across a wider range of digital assets. Deposits to exchanges are often interpreted as a signal of upcoming trading activity, as funds are moved from wallets to platforms where they can be quickly exchanged. Whether this results in increased buying or selling depends on how the broader market evolves in the coming days. The uptick in deposits could indicate growing interest in altcoins as traders look for opportunities beyond Bitcoin amid its recent stagnation.

A major player in the asset management space, Trivest Advisors, has made a substantial commitment to the digital asset market. This Hong Kong-based firm, which oversees an impressive $1.2 billion in assets, recently revealed a massive $90.4 million investment in BlackRock‚Äôs spot Bitcoin ETF, known by its ticker IBIT. This isn‚Äôt just a large sum; it‚Äôs a clear signal of growing confidence from established financial institutions in the world of digital assets. Such a significant move by Trivest Advisors underscores the increasing mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin and its associated investment vehicles, particularly the highly anticipated BlackRock Bitcoin ETF . A Pivotal Institutional Bitcoin Investment by Trivest Advisors This investment by Trivest Advisors isn‚Äôt just about the dollar amount; it signifies a strategic move. Their $90.4 million stake in BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT likely places them among the top 10 holders of the fund globally. This is a monumental step for institutional Bitcoin investment , as it demonstrates how traditional asset managers are actively integrating digital assets into their portfolios. Such a substantial commitment from a firm managing over a billion dollars sends a powerful message. It validates Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class for large-scale financial entities. This move could also inspire other hesitant institutional investors to consider similar allocations to spot Bitcoin ETFs. The Expanding Landscape of Spot Bitcoin ETF Adoption The launch of spot Bitcoin ETF products in the United States has truly transformed the cryptocurrency investment landscape. These funds offer a regulated and accessible pathway for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements without directly holding the cryptocurrency. Trivest Advisors‚Äô move highlights the accelerating trend of widespread spot Bitcoin ETF adoption. This surge in institutional interest reflects a growing understanding of Bitcoin‚Äôs potential. It also showcases the effectiveness of these ETF products in bridging the gap between traditional finance and the innovative world of digital currencies. The ease of access and regulatory oversight provided by these ETFs are key drivers behind this institutional influx. What Does This Mean for Crypto ETF Investment? Trivest Advisors‚Äô significant stake has broader implications for the entire crypto ETF investment sector. It indicates a maturing market where sophisticated investors are actively seeking exposure to digital assets through regulated products. This could lead to: Increased Liquidity: More institutional money flowing into ETFs generally enhances market liquidity. Price Stability: Greater institutional participation can contribute to more stable price discovery for Bitcoin. Broader Acceptance: Such investments pave the way for wider acceptance of cryptocurrencies in mainstream finance. While the benefits are clear, it‚Äôs also important to acknowledge that any crypto ETF investment still carries inherent market volatility. Investors should always conduct thorough research and understand the risks involved. Analyzing the Top Bitcoin ETF Holders The news about Trivest Advisors‚Äô investment naturally prompts questions about the current landscape of Bitcoin ETF holders . While exact real-time rankings can fluctuate, a $90.4 million stake positions Trivest Advisors as a significant player. This investment places them alongside other notable entities that have recognized the long-term value proposition of Bitcoin through the ETF structure.

49665982,549381,1754528416,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49665982.jpeg,Base Explains Network Disruption: Sequencer Glitch Led To 33-Minute Block Production Halt,https://bitcoinist.com/base-explains-network-disruption-33-minute-halt/,"Base, the Ethereum Layer-2 solution developed by Coinbase, experienced a 33-minute network disruption that halted block production on its Mainnet. The outage occurred on August 5, 2025, and was caused by unexpected on-chain congestion combined with an unprepared backup sequencer. While Base is designed with high availability in mind‚Äîfeaturing multiple sequencer instances managed by Conductor (an OP Stack component)‚Äîa critical handoff failure required manual intervention to resume operations. This event sparked immediate fear and speculation across the crypto community. Investors and users began to question the sustainability of the network, especially as Layer-2 scaling solutions are expected to offer seamless, reliable performance. The incident highlighted potential vulnerabilities in the sequencer infrastructure, casting doubt on whether Base can maintain uptime and stability during periods of high demand. As trust in the network was momentarily shaken, critics pointed to the risks of centralized sequencer management, while supporters emphasized that the quick response prevented a longer disruption. Nonetheless, the reputational impact has raised concerns for both institutional users and DeFi projects considering the network for deployment. The coming weeks will be critical as they address these concerns and work to restore confidence in the network. Base Outlines Root Cause And Fixes Network Outage Following the recent 33-minute network disruption, Base published a detailed postmortem report explaining the technical root cause and the mitigation steps taken to restore the network. The issue stemmed from a sequencer handoff failure within the system‚Äôs High Availability (HA) cluster, which is managed by Conductor, an OP Stack component designed to maintain uptime and minimize single points of failure. At 6:07am UTC, the active sequencer started lagging behind due to intense on-chain activity. Conductor, functioning as intended, initiated an automated handoff to a new sequencer. However, the new sequencer was still being provisioned and wasn‚Äôt yet ready to produce blocks. Typically, if a newly elected sequencer is unhealthy, Conductor would perform another handoff. Unfortunately, since Conductor wasn‚Äôt fully operational on this sequencer, it couldn‚Äôt initiate another transfer. By 6:09am UTC, monitoring systems flagged the issue, and the Base team was paged. At 6:12am UTC, the incident was officially declared. To mitigate the issue, Base engineers paused Conductor‚Äôs HA software to stop further faulty leadership transfers and manually elected a healthy sequencer. By 6:40am UTC, the network had resumed normal operations. To prevent future incidents, Base is working on updating its infrastructure to ensure that any sequencer added to the cluster is always capable of leadership transfer if elected. Additionally, the team is enhancing testing protocols to validate these fixes before deployment. These measures are aimed at bolstering Base‚Äôs system robustness and avoiding similar disruptions in the future. Ethereum Price Action Reflects Market Caution Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $3,611.52 after experiencing a sharp decline from its recent local high of $3,940. The price is struggling to regain bullish momentum, failing to hold above the $3,700 resistance zone. This chart shows that ETH has entered a consolidation phase after its aggressive rally from $2,852.16, which remains a key support level in case of further downside. The 50-day moving average (blue line) is acting as dynamic resistance around the $3,640 zone, while the 100-day (green line) and 200-day (red line) moving averages are still positioned below the price, reflecting a broader bullish trend. However, the recent rejection near the $3,860.80 level indicates that bulls are losing control in the short term. While Base itself doesn‚Äôt have a native token, its performance is closely tied to Ethereum‚Äôs Layer-2 ecosystem narrative. Investors are now watching closely to see if ETH can stabilize above $3,600, as any further weakness could amplify doubts about the broader L2 market.

Three names are making the loudest noise, Spartans.com, Stake.com, and Betway. Each follows a different plan. Stake builds buzz with ongoing prize pools, Betway offers steady seasonal free bet deals, and Spartans turns all the spotlight on a single grand prize, a Lamborghini, for one winner. For those chasing life-changing wins, the question is not only who offers the biggest prize, but also who offers the clearest way to get it. Here‚Äôs how these three heavyweights compare when ambition, clarity, and player experience go head-to-head. Spartans: Single-Prize Lamborghini Giveaway Grabs Big Attention Spartans has focused all its promotional effort on one major goal, awarding a Lamborghini to a single winner in a live-streamed finale. Unlike quiet prize draws or rotating offers, Spartans makes the entire process public and competitive. Entry is simple: sign up, deposit crypto, and opt into the Lamborghini Challenge. There are no complex missions or unclear rules. This direct style makes Spartans stand out in 2025‚Äôs big prize scene as one of the most confident operators. The pull is powerful. One grand prize creates more excitement than many smaller, hidden rewards. Every deposit feels like a step toward the spotlight. Both casual players and high-stakes users instantly understand the stakes and can‚Äôt ignore the outcome. In 2025, this is a clear example of a crypto giveaway designed to thrill rather than just keep people engaged. With instant withdrawals after the win, Spartans also sets a higher standard for trust and transparency, giving the campaign both credibility and maximum player impact. Stake.com: Constant Prizes Over One Big Spotlight Stake.com builds its giveaways around non-stop action. Players see weekly $50,000 raffles, leaderboard races, and rotating prize pools. The aim is simple, keep the activity flowing with plenty of chances to win. It‚Äôs a perfect fit for regular players who enjoy tracking many promos. Stake also fuels engagement through community live streams and influencer tie-ins. Still, while the total prize value is huge, the focus gets blurred. Rewards are shared among thousands or replaced so quickly that no single event stands out. For some, this means more chances. For others, it means less thrill. Against Spartans‚Äô single Lamborghini spotlight, Stake‚Äôs rewards lean more on loyalty than emotion. Strong in numbers, but lighter in lasting impact. Betway: Steady and Safe Rewards Betway takes a more traditional route, seasonal giveaways, boosted odds, and free bet draws. While not fully crypto-focused, some areas now allow digital currency play. Joining is easy: place a bet, earn an entry, and you could win credits, merchandise, or small cash amounts. This works for players who want stability over spectacle. But in a year when crypto gambling promos are getting bolder and more public, Betway‚Äôs approach feels careful. The prizes rarely hit the size that sparks major excitement, and the process blends in with the sportsbook‚Äôs regular flow. For those wanting easy bonuses, it‚Äôs fine. But compared to a Lamborghini or weekly six-figure pools, Betway‚Äôs style comes across as safe, but forgettable. Wrap Up The key difference in this contest is intent. Spartans is built to be remembered. The Lamborghini Challenge rewards and impresses in equal measure. It‚Äôs public, final, and impossible to mix up with a normal promo. Stake spreads its big rewards across too many winners to create one unforgettable moment. Betway stays in its comfort zone instead of pushing limits. Spartans wins not just on the size of the prize but on how it‚Äôs delivered, clear entry, tangible reward, and a finale set for all to see. This rare mix of openness and excitement makes it stand out among big prize sites. For players choosing where to play, Spartans tells the simplest story: no missions, no point systems, no tiers. Just one question, do you want the car? And for many, that clarity beats the noise of endless promos.

49666712,https://thecoinrise.com/cold-wallet-stuns-crypto-market-with-270m-deal-and-2m-users-pre-launch/,1754528437,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/49666712.jpeg,Cold Wallet Stuns Crypto Market With $270M Deal and 2M Users Pre-Launch!,https://thecoinrise.com/cold-wallet-stuns-crypto-market-with-270m-deal-and-2m-users-pre-launch/,"Crypto presales in 2025 are gaining momentum, but many are offering unfinished projects, lacking products, user bases, or any proof of delivery. Cold Wallet is the clear exception. It recently finalized a $270 million purchase, securing active infrastructure and a user base of more than 2 million, all before its official launch. This isn‚Äôt just a pitch on paper. Cold Wallet (CWT) is already functioning with tested systems and a built-in real-time cashback mechanism. It‚Äôs not preparing to look legitimate later. It‚Äôs already doing what others promise. In a market filled with vague blueprints, Cold Wallet stands out as one of the rare 2025 crypto presales showing actual results. A Bold $270M Acquisition That Changes the Game Where most presale projects are still seeking attention and building from the ground up, Cold Wallet made a strategic move with a $270 million acquisition. This deal brought the well-established Plus Wallet under its ownership, along with over 2 million active users. It wasn‚Äôt a marketing gimmick or token trade; it was a real purchase that redefined Cold Wallet‚Äôs standing. It‚Äôs not a small concept hoping to grow, it‚Äôs already equipped with the tools, tech, and user traction. For anyone reviewing crypto presales 2025, Cold Wallet isn‚Äôt forecasting what it might become; it‚Äôs building it already. Two Million Users Integrated Instantly With the Plus Wallet takeover, Cold Wallet didn‚Äôt just obtain software. It gained people. Over 2 million functioning wallets are now part of its system, with no long onboarding or transition delays. This scale of verified user migration is nearly unmatched among presales. While others rely on giveaways and referral campaigns, Cold Wallet now launches with one of the strongest user bases in the space. Each of these users adds power to the Cold Wallet ecosystem‚Äôs usage, demand, and pace. CWT isn‚Äôt merely a presale token; it powers an ecosystem that‚Äôs already running. Built on Working Systems, Not Empty Promises Cold Wallet also inherited a full-fledged operational backend and user interface through the acquisition. This matters. It allows Cold Wallet to release features quickly and without delays or broken promises. Core functions like wallet setup, gas tracking, fiat on-ramps, and multi-chain swaps aren‚Äôt goals; they‚Äôre already active features, thanks to the structure taken from Plus Wallet. Macro view of a screen of trading terminal with abstract financial graph and digits. Trading and forex concept. 3D Rendering Instead of starting at zero, Cold Wallet is accelerating a platform that already functions efficiently. Real Cashback That Rewards Activity Cold Wallet‚Äôs reward system isn‚Äôt an add-on. It‚Äôs central to the product. Users earn automatic cashback in CWT for performing tasks like swapping, transferring, or paying for gas. There are no complicated steps, staking requirements, or interfaces to navigate. The more CWT held, the higher the cashback tier, ranging from 10% up to 100%. This model directly connects platform usage to token demand. With millions of users arriving, that structure becomes even more valuable. Referral Program With Immediate Payouts Cold Wallet‚Äôs referral structure is designed to reward users upfront. Referrers earn USDT immediately, along with bonus CWT coins during the ongoing presale phase. There‚Äôs no post-launch delay or empty promises. It‚Äôs real-time value shared with those helping grow the network. This transforms Cold Wallet into a network-growing tool. Each referral not only boosts numbers but also enhances token circulation and reach. Cold Wallet‚Äôs Presale Numbers Surge Cold Wallet‚Äôs presale is still early, yet the progress is massive. The price in Stage 16 is set at $0.00942, while the listing price is projected at $0.3517. This indicates a gain potential of over 4,900%. So far, over 685 million CWT have been sold and the presale has brought in more than $5.7 million. This isn‚Äôt a case of searching for traction. Cold Wallet already has momentum and still offers entry at favorable terms. Why Cold Wallet Leads Among Crypto Presales 2025 Rather than making claims about future developments, Cold Wallet has already achieved key milestones. From securing a $270M platform and integrating 2 million users, to activating live systems and distributing real cashback, everything is already in motion. The referral rewards are live. The wallet features are deployed. The tech works and scales. There are no missing parts, only continued progress. Among all crypto presales 2025 , few are showing this level of readiness. Cold Wallet stands apart with real infrastructure, a solid user base, and a clear model linking utility to value. And with early presale stages still active, the entry point remains attractive for those following tangible success.

That‚Äôs why traders are zooming in on four high-upside contenders. This roundup highlights the top altcoin to watch right now, BlockDAG, Hyperliquid, Sui, and Binance Coin (BNB), each showing unique strength, big momentum, and solid structures behind the price action. BlockDAG is exploding with its $364M presale and tech-first ecosystem. Hyperliquid is proving structure matters, even at a premium. Sui thrives on volatility with a technical edge. And BNB? It‚Äôs holding strong with real-world adoption and institutional eyes watching. Whether you‚Äôre in it for quick flips or long-term gains, these four deserve a closer look. 1. BlockDAG: The Presale Powerhouse Turning Heads in Every Cycle When it comes to presales, few are making waves like BlockDAG (BDAG) . This project blends DAG architecture with Layer 1 scalability, setting it up to handle high volumes without the lag of older blockchains. That‚Äôs exactly why traders are flocking in, and why BlockDAG is the top altcoin to watch this season. The numbers are loud: $364 million raised, 24.8 billion BDAG coins sold, over 18,900 miners gone, and $7.7 million in hardware revenue. BDAG is priced at $0.0016 right now, while its listing is locked at $0.05. That‚Äôs a staggering 3,025% return sitting in plain sight. The 10 BTC Auction adds more fuel, every buyer gets a shot at winning Bitcoin. With this bonus and the price window closing by August 11, the energy around BDAG is real. Traders know it: this is one of the biggest shots to get in before liftoff. 2. Sui: Volatility-Driven & Timing-Obsessed Sui lives for volatility, and traders love it. Built with the Move programming language, it‚Äôs designed to give more control over digital ownership and speed. That draws in users who want performance without compromise. SUI reacts fast to market shifts, making it a prime target for tactical trades. Right now, it‚Äôs hovering at levels traders are eyeing for potential reentry. For anyone scanning for the top altcoin to watch during uncertain conditions, Sui delivers precision opportunities. It‚Äôs less about hype, more about execution, and the payoff can be real if the entry is right. 3. Hyperliquid: High Price, Strong Structure, Still on Radar Hyperliquid isn‚Äôt cheap, but it‚Äôs not backing down either. While many sit on the sidelines hoping for a dip, HYPE continues to show it‚Äôs built on solid foundations. The buzz comes from its role in the perpetual futures space, where speed, depth, and on-chain data are driving next-level platforms. Its infrastructure meets the needs of fast-moving markets while staying decentralized. For those waiting on bullish sentiment to return, Hyperliquid is the one to stalk. The price may not be perfect yet, but the structure is strong, and when it moves, it could move big. 4. BNB: Real Utility Meets Long-Term Power BNB is one of the few tokens that doesn‚Äôt just rely on speculation. As the fuel behind Binance Smart Chain, it powers trading, staking, and governance, putting it at the center of daily crypto activity. Despite market dips, BNB is holding near all-time highs. That kind of stability is turning heads at the institutional level. Talks of BNB-backed products, crypto funds, and new treasuries show just how deep the value runs. For traders playing the long game, BNB isn‚Äôt just an exchange token, it‚Äôs a foundation for serious growth. BDAG Takes the Lead in This Altcoin Race Each of these picks has something to offer, from Sui‚Äôs sharp moves to BNB‚Äôs consistent traction. Hyperliquid shows us why structure matters, even at high prices. But one project is hitting on all fronts: BlockDAG. Presale strength? Check. $364 million locked in. Real tools? Already live. Community momentum? Surging. BlockDAG isn‚Äôt waiting to prove itself, it‚Äôs doing it right now. For those aiming for big upside, solid tech, and a clear launch plan, this is the top altcoin to watch before the next phase begins. If you‚Äôre serious about catching the next breakout, don‚Äôt let this one pass you by.

The Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), operating under South Korea‚Äôs Financial Services Commission (FSC), has initiated a comprehensive study. This move highlights the nation‚Äôs commitment to creating a robust and secure environment for digital assets, particularly stablecoins, through proactive virtual asset legislation . Why is South Korea Stablecoin Regulation So Important? On August 6th, the FSC‚Äôs FIU commissioned a pivotal FSC stablecoin study . This initiative focuses on the second phase of virtual asset legislation and aims to establish clear anti-money laundering (AML) measures for stablecoins. This proactive approach is designed to integrate stablecoins into the existing financial framework, allowing their legitimate use for payments and cross-border transfers. The goal is to foster innovation while ensuring consumer protection and financial stability. By bringing stablecoins under a regulatory umbrella, South Korea seeks to mitigate risks associated with illicit activities and market volatility. This is a critical step for the broader adoption of digital currencies and strengthens South Korea stablecoin regulation efforts. What Does This Stablecoin Legislation Entail? The upcoming stablecoin legislation is not just about compliance; it‚Äôs about defining the future role of these digital assets.

Priced at $0.035, the new DeFi project has caught the eye of traders. investors who get in on phase 6 presale of MUTM will experience a 71.43% return on investment as the project goes live at $0.06. Mutuum Finance has now surpassed over $14.1 million and over 14,800 investors. Meanwhile, legacy tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE) continue to struggle with sideways momentum and lack of innovation, making way for utility-driven platforms like Mutuum to dominate headlines and investor interest. As capital rotates into more purpose-built DeFi ecosystems, the narrative this month belongs not to memecoins but to the rise of next-gen, use-case-backed assets like MUTM. Dogecoin (DOGE) Hovering Near $0.20 Amid Rotation Toward Utility-Driven Tokens Dogecoin is currently trading around $0.20, having pulled back roughly 4% in the past 24 hours and about 15% off its July peak of around $0.26‚Äì$0.27 as investor appetite shifts away from meme narratives. Despite whale accumulation, over 2‚ÄØbillion DOGE (~$400M) observed at $0.21 support levels, technical indicators like weakening RSI and flat volume suggest momentum is waning. Short-term resistance sits in the $0.23‚Äì$0.24 zone, while support levels around $0.20‚Äì$0.21 could determine DOGE‚Äôs next path. As capital begins rotating toward utility-driven DeFi platforms, emerging protocol narratives like Mutuum Finance are increasingly drawing investor focus. Mutuum Finance Launches Phase 6 of Token Presale Mutuum Finance has recently introduced Round 6 of its presale with tokens now live at $0.035, a 16.17% increase from the last round. The next price increase will take the token up by another 14.29% to $0.04, so members will now be able to make 71.43% when it finally goes live at $0.06. The presale itself has already garnered over 14,800 investors and raised over $14.1 million, demonstrating the belief that the market has placed on the potential of MUTM. Dual-Lending: Empowering Future-Proof DeFi Mutuum Finance adopts a twin-model approach of facilitating flexibility and efficacy in Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending models. Peer-to-Contract makes use of autonomous smart contracts that carry out the lending independently without any participation of human beings whatsoever. They have been designed to operate on dynamic rates in the market with an unpredictable rate of interest as guided by existing demand and supply of an in-real-time interest. Peer-to-Peer model reduces intermediaries and allows market to be in direct interaction with borrowers and lenders. Mutuum Finance Boosts Stability Focus Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will introduce a stablecoin to be USD-pegged on the Ethereum blockchain. It will be sound and secure investment product to remove risk and uncertainty that can be attributed to algorithmic stablecoins. The project is audited with a 95.0 trust score by Certik. That is a key milestone as much as Mutuum Finance‚Äôs goal is to become an institutional-grade and transparent DeFi protocol. That also shows that the team is proud to be industry security standards-compliant. Mutuum Finance Deploys $50K Bug Bounty to Strengthen Protocol Security Mutuum Finance has initiated its Bug Bounty Program with the reward pool value of $50,000 USDT. There are four severity levels in the program. They include critical, major, minor, and low. All the probable bugs are hence found and rewarded. It is in line with the vision of the team to establish a secure, open, and quality DeFi protocol. As Dogecoin stalls near $0.20 with little to show in terms of innovation, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining momentum fast. The project has already raised over $14.1 million and attracted 14,800+ investors, signaling strong market confidence. Investors joining Phase 6 at $0.035 can lock in a 71.43% return when the token launches at $0.06. With a dual-lending system, USD-pegged stablecoin in development, CertiK audit, and $50K bug bounty, MUTM is proving it‚Äôs more than hype, it‚Äôs built for long-term growth. Join the presale before the next price increase hits.

The launch of its second-generation smartphone has captured the attention of both crypto investors and mobile tech enthusiasts. Meanwhile, early investors looking for the next big opportunity are also watching MAGACOIN FINANCE, a project gaining serious traction during its early stage with massive upside projections. Seeker Smartphone: A Web3 Powerhouse in Your Pocket Solana Mobile has begun shipping its new crypto-focused smartphone, the Seeker, to over 50 countries worldwide. With more than 150,000 units pre-ordered, it‚Äôs already outpacing the original Saga phone, which sold just 20,000. Retailing at $450‚Äì$500, the Seeker is expected to bring in at least $67.5 million in revenue. But what truly sets the Seeker apart is its deep integration with blockchain tools. It includes a hardware-isolated Seed Vault for securely storing private keys and recovery phrases, along with a decentralized app store that bypasses Apple and Google‚Äôs restrictive frameworks. This opens up direct access to NFTs, DeFi, games, and dApps‚Äîall without the usual 30% commissions or app store bans. New Contender Could Outperform Even Solana‚Äôs Gains While Solana is generating buzz with real-world products, MAGACOIN FINANCE is turning heads with numbers. With analysts forecasting up to 14,500% returns from its current stage, it‚Äôs quickly becoming one of the most talked-about altcoins of the year . As access tightens and allocations vanish, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing comparisons to early-stage SHIB and DOGE‚Äîbut with a more advanced ecosystem in development. For those entering before major exchange listings, the potential could be enormous. Is $500 SOL a Realistic Target? The buzz around the Seeker has added fresh fuel to Solana‚Äôs price outlook . Already showing strength amid altcoin rotation, SOL could ride the wave of mobile adoption to new highs. Analysts point to key ecosystem metrics‚ÄîDeFi TVL, NFT activity, and user growth‚Äîas signs of continued strength. If momentum holds, a run to $500 is within reach, especially considering the anticipation of spot ETF approval. Conclusion The Seeker‚Äôs launch marks a major step forward for crypto-native mobile tech, and Solana is leading the charge. But while SOL‚Äôs climb to $500 is drawing speculation, some investors are placing their bets on MAGACOIN FINANCE for even bigger returns . With limited access remaining and bold ROI projections , this might be the altcoin to watch as the next bull run unfolds.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Bitcoin (BTC) is treading water around $115K Thursday morning in Asia, up 1% in the last 24 hours, as the post-all-time-high correction continues to play out across low volume and weak conviction. According to Glassnode , BTC has entered what it calls an ‚Äúair gap‚Äù, a low-liquidity zone between $110,000 and $116,000, after breaking down from a major supply cluster where short-term holders had previously found support. These areas typically see little trading activity and can either serve as a base for accumulation or become a trapdoor for deeper downside if demand fails to return. ‚ÄúThe market is effectively re-finding its footing,‚Äù Glassnode analysts wrote, describing the range between $110K (the prior ATH) and $116K (recent buyer cost basis) as the new battleground. They noted that while opportunistic buying has emerged, with 120,000 BTC acquired on the dip, prices have yet to reclaim resistance levels convincingly, particularly the ~$116.9K threshold that marks recent short-term holder entry points. Short-term holder profitability has dropped from 100% to 70%, which Glassnode frames as typical for a bull market mid-phase. But without fresh inflows, this could quickly erode sentiment. ETF flows have turned negative, with a -1.5K BTC outflow earlier this week, the largest since April. At the same time, funding rates in the derivatives market have cooled, reflecting reduced leverage and a more cautious stance among speculators. Market maker Enflux offered a similar take: ‚ÄúCrypto markets remain in a fragile holding pattern. Despite some relief in the altcoin space, majors like BTC and ETH are still struggling to inspire confidence,‚Äù it wrote in a client note. ‚ÄúThe broader trend? Heavy legs with more or less light volume.‚Äù ETH is up 2% in the last 24 hours, trading just below $3,600. The CoinDesk 20 Index , which tracks a broad basket of crypto assets, gained 1.69% to 3,815.22. ‚ÄúUntil BTC and ETH reclaim strength with volume,‚Äù Enflux added, ‚Äúthe path of least resistance could remain sideways to down.‚Äù The market‚Äôs next move likely hinges on whether buyers are willing to step in and build a base within this low-volume zone, or whether another flush toward $110K is needed to reset the trend. For now, traders remain cautious, and the bulls remain unproven. Market Movers: BTC: A potential Bitcoin supply shock, driven by drying OTC desk reserves and steady corporate accumulation, could ‚Äúuncork‚Äù BTC price action after a dip below $110K, market observers say. ETH: Ethereum may have formed a local top as sell pressure hits $419 million, its second-highest on record, while ETH retests a major resistance zone near $4,000 that preceded a 66% drop in late 2024, raising the risk of a 25‚Äì35% decline by September; meanwhile, Polymarket bettors remain split, with 48% backing a rally to $5,000 despite the bearish signals. Gold: Gold's rally stalled Wednesday as traders took profits and weighed rising Fed rate cut odds, U.S. trade tensions, and a looming Fed leadership shakeup, leaving prices flat after a three-day gain driven by economic weakness; spot gold last traded at $3,372.11, down 0.24% on the day. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets opened mixed Thursday, with Japan‚Äôs Nikkei 225 flat, as investors shrugged off new U.S. semiconductor tariff threats. S&P 500: U.S. stock futures were flat Wednesday night as traders digested Trump‚Äôs new semiconductor tariffs, with the S&P 500 still up 1.7% for the week.

Economists and markets widely anticipate a 25 basis point cut , maintaining the central bank‚Äôs current once-per-quarter pace of monetary easing. The decision will be announced at 12 p.m. in London, followed by a press conference with Governor Andrew Bailey at 12:30 p.m. The rate cut would mark the fifth consecutive quarter-point reduction, bringing UK rates below those of the U.S. Federal Reserve, which last moved in 2024 and currently holds its benchmark at 4.25%‚Äì4.5%. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is expected to stick with its cautious guidance of ‚Äúgradual and careful‚Äù reductions, as inflation pressures re-emerge. June inflation came in at 3.6%, higher than the bank‚Äôs 3.4% forecast and its highest reading in 17 months, driven by surging energy and food prices. The BoE may now revise its near-term inflation outlook closer to 4% for the year. Governor Bailey has downplayed the spike as temporary, but Chief Economist Huw Pill and others have warned of second-round effects feeding into wages and core inflation. BoE faces mounting growth risks as job losses soar Meanwhile, growth concerns have intensified following back-to-back contractions in the spring and rising unemployment tied to April‚Äôs payroll tax and minimum wage hikes. More than 180,000 jobs have been lost since Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced a ¬£26 billion increase in employer national insurance contributions, pushing the unemployment rate to a four-year high. The MPC is expected to highlight these labour market challenges in its updated projections. In May, it forecast growth of 1% in 2025 and 1.25% in 2026, though recent data suggests a potential upward revision after better-than-expected Q1 performance and an upgraded estimate for Q2 growth. The decision is likely to expose divisions within the nine-member MPC. A Bloomberg survey suggests a three-way split: most members favouring a 25bp cut, two pushing for a larger 50bp move, and two likely to vote for no change. Pill and external member Catherine Mann, who opposed cuts in May, are expected to maintain their stance, while Swati Dhingra and Alan Taylor may advocate for a more aggressive reduction. While today‚Äôs move is mostly priced in, traders will be watching closely for any change in forward guidance. Markets expect one more cut this year, likely in November, bringing the rate down to around 3.5% by 2026. ‚ÄúThe risks are tilted in a hawkish direction,‚Äù said Dan Hanson, Chief UK Economist at Bloomberg Economics. ‚ÄúThe committee may signal it‚Äôs rethinking its once-a-quarter pace, implying a November cut isn‚Äôt guaranteed.‚Äù BoE reconsiders bond sales strategy as long-dated gilt yields surge Attention is also turning to the BoE‚Äôs balance sheet reduction strategy. Quantitative tightening (QT) has already reduced bond holdings by about ¬£100 billion annually, but market strain‚Äîespecially in long-dated gilts‚Äîhas sparked speculation that the BoE could slow or shift the pace of sales. Governor Bailey has recently flagged concerns over rising 30-year gilt yields, reaching levels last seen in the late 1990s. A pivot toward shorter-dated debt or a reduced pace of active sales (currently expected at ¬£26 billion a year) may be under consideration ahead of the BoE‚Äôs September QT update. According to Sanjay Raja, Chief UK Economist at Deutsche Bank, a signal acknowledging long-end liquidity issues could foreshadow changes in the BoE‚Äôs sales strategy.

During a podcast appearance this week, Long was openly skeptical of the¬†company behind XRP. She alleged that the company had fallen short of its initial mission, replacing traditional banking, specifically the SWIFT network. Although on top of this, she also claimed that Ripple‚Äôs past had ‚Äúall the makings‚Äù of an initial coin offering (ICO) and argued why Ripple would be releasing a new stablecoin on Ethereum rather than entirely through the XRP Ledger. Schwartz quickly took to social media, particularly X, dispelled the misinformation, and offered further engagement. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm available whenever you want to chat about the facts about Ripple, our stablecoin RLUSD, the XRP Ledger, and its native token XRP.‚Äù He wrote . Schwartz also directed readers to a detailed post by XRPL validator @Vet_X0, which ‚Äúsets the record straight‚Äù and is a useful entry point for anyone seeking factual information. XRPL validator rejects ‚ÄòICO‚Äô allegations The validator, Vet ( @Vet_X0 ), strongly rejected Caitlin Long‚Äôs characterization of XRP as the result of an initial coin offering (ICO). He said she appeared to lack a clear understanding of the subject, yet spoke about it confidently. Vet explained that Ripple did not raise funds through an ICO. Instead, when the XRP Ledger launched in 2012, the entire supply of 100 billion XRP tokens was placed in a genesis account. At that time, the tokens had no monetary value and no public sale or capital raise. This counters Long‚Äôs claim that XRP‚Äôs origins are comparable to projects like Ethereum, which conducted a well-documented public ICO in 2014, raising funds in Bitcoin to distribute ETH to early backers. Vet also had a beef with Long claiming not once, but twice, that Ripple essentially centralizes the XRP Ledger. Vet said Long‚Äôs comments were either ignorance or technical illiteracy. He said that XRP Ledger is open-source and decentralized, and that anyone could run a validator or fork the code. Currently, the XRPL hosts over 1,000 nodes and over 100 active validators, many of which are controlled by independent individuals, universities, businesses, and financial institutions, not Ripple. Ripple said it does not own these validators and can‚Äôt update the network unaided. Ripple expands RLUSD to both Ethereum and XRPL Caitlin Long is concerned that the choice made by Ripple to launch its RLUSD stablecoin on Ethereum contradicts its original vision of using the XRP Ledger as the backbone of global finance. She suggested switching to Ethereum might mean Ripple isn‚Äôt trusting in its infrastructure. XRPL validator Vet replied that RLUSD was to be issued on Ethereum and the XRP Ledger as a deliberate multi-chain strategy. He stressed that this isn‚Äôt a move away from XRPL but rather a pragmatic attempt to enhance liquidity and target a more diverse audience across other blockchain ecosystems. According to Vet, Ripple Payments and RLUSD continue to operate natively on the XRP Ledger, and Ethereum‚Äôs involvement merely complements‚Äînot replaces‚Äîthe network‚Äôs capabilities. Vet also took the opportunity to spotlight XRPL‚Äôs long-standing technical leadership. He noted that the XRP Ledger was the first blockchain to embed a decentralized exchange (DEX) directly into its protocol. It also pioneered native tokenization, enabling users to issue custom assets without relying on smart contracts. Development on the XRP Ledger, Vet stressed, has never stagnated. Its amendment system continually adds new features based on community consensus. He described the ecosystem as vibrant, supported by a growing developer base, strong liquidity, and deeper connections to real-world finance, which are further strengthened with the rollout of RLUSD.

As of today, ETH trades at approximately $3,598, reflecting a 1% decrease in the past 24 hours. This pullback follows months of mixed price action across the market, as traders balance optimism over long-term fundamentals with short-term risk management. New insights from on-chain data suggest heightened market activity surrounding Ethereum despite its failure to reclaim the $4,000 mark. Analysts point to unprecedented levels of Open Interest (OI) in Ethereum futures contracts, combined with record daily transactions on its network. While this signals growing participation and network adoption, it also raises concerns about potential volatility if market sentiment shifts abruptly. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Falters Above $3,700 ‚Äì Is a Pullback Brewing? Ethereum Open Interest Hits All-Time High CryptoQuant analyst CryptoOnchain reported that Ethereum‚Äôs OI on Binance has recently reached a record-breaking $77 billion. Open Interest measures the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, providing insight into market activity and trader participation. The surge suggests that more capital is entering ETH futures markets, potentially setting the stage for significant price movements. This rise in OI coincides with Ethereum reaching its highest daily transaction count ever recorded. Analysts link this spike in activity to increased engagement in decentralized finance (DeFi), growth in layer-2 scaling solutions, and broader adoption of Ethereum-based applications. CryptoOnchain noted that such developments ‚Äúhighlight growing participation and user engagement,‚Äù adding that this type of market buildup often precedes sharp price trends, either upward or downward. However, this accumulation of leveraged positions carries risk. If price movements turn unfavorable for the majority of open contracts, a wave of liquidations could occur, amplifying volatility. This has been a recurring theme in the cryptocurrency market, where leveraged positions can trigger cascading sell-offs during sudden price corrections. Bearish Signals Emerge from Market Order Activity Another CryptoQuant analyst, Maartunn, highlighted a different indicator that reflects short-term market pressure on Ethereum. According to his data, Net Taker Volume for ETH stood at -$418.8 million daily. This figure represents roughly 115,400 more ETH sold via market orders than bought, indicating a clear imbalance in favor of sellers. Market orders, unlike limit orders, execute trades immediately at the best available price. A sustained negative Net Taker Volume often signals urgency among sellers, potentially foreshadowing further downside if buy-side demand fails to absorb the selling pressure. Maartunn explained that ‚Äúsuch behavior indicates participants were willing to prioritize execution speed over price,‚Äù typically a bearish market sign.

In a high-level meeting with Vice President Gibran Rakabuming Raka‚Äôs office, representatives from Bitcoin Indonesia presented a detailed proposal outlining how the country could use surplus renewable energy to mine and accumulate Bitcoin as part of a long-term economic development plan. Indonesian Bitcoin (BTC) Reserve Move Despite stringent crypto tax policies and a nationwide ban on using crypto for payments, Indonesian officials are reportedly receptive to the idea of a Bitcoin reserve for the economy. A key component of the discussion involved the importance of public education, with Bitcoin Indonesia advocating for awareness programs to improve understanding of Bitcoin‚Äôs economic potential. The group also shared macroeconomic projections, including Michael Saylor‚Äôs bullish forecast of Bitcoin reaching $13 million by 2045. With a stable inflation rate of 0.76% and a debt-to-GDP ratio of just 39%, Indonesia‚Äôs interest in Bitcoin is not driven by economic desperation but rather by a strategic vision to diversify its reserves and leverage untapped geothermal and hydroelectric energy for sustainable mining. Brazil Moves Forward with Crypto Reserve Legislation While Indonesia explores its options, Brazil is already advancing a national conversation on Bitcoin reserves . The country‚Äôs House of Representatives is scheduled to hold a public hearing on August 20 to debate a bill that could allow up to 5% of its treasury, approximately $15 billion, to be allocated to Bitcoin. Six key institutions, including Brazil‚Äôs central bank and finance ministry, will participate in the discussions. Though the bill faces opposition from some financial authorities, Vice President Geraldo Alckmin‚Äôs office has endorsed it as being in the national interest. This marks Brazil‚Äôs first-ever public hearing on crypto reserves and underscores a growing global shift toward the institutionalization of Bitcoin. A Global Trend Toward Sovereign Bitcoin Holdings Indonesia and Brazil join a growing list of nations, including the United States, Ukraine, Bhutan, and Kazakhstan, that are actively exploring Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. While motivations vary, from hedging against inflation to modernizing financial infrastructure, the trend is clear: sovereign Bitcoin reserves are no longer a fringe idea. As more governments assess the potential of digital assets, Bitcoin‚Äôs role in national economic strategies appears poised to grow significantly, signaling a transformative era in global finance.

XRP is gaining renewed interest as traders adjust positions following news of the ETF delay. Stellar recently led the charts after a breakout rally, briefly pushing past major altcoins. While these price moves get coverage, the real opportunity may lie in platforms offering lasting utility and active user rewards. Cold Wallet is gaining traction on that front. Now in Stage 16 of its presale at just $0.00942, it combines self-custody, real-world utility, and up to 100% cashback. With a launch price set at $0.3517, it gives users a 3,600% return potential. Over 682.8 million coins have already been sold. Rather than hype-based movement, Cold Wallet ($CWT) offers a working system that delivers value daily. It‚Äôs shifting focus from price watching to actual use. XRP‚Äôs Price Slips as ETF Delay Shifts Focus Elsewhere XRP‚Äôs price saw a burst of activity earlier this month, but the momentum didn‚Äôt last. The delay in launching the inverse XRP ETF until August 4, 2025, cooled off the rally. Prices briefly spiked to $0.52 before slipping back below $0.50, signaling a dip in short-term confidence. For now, XRP‚Äôs next moves depend more on regulation than innovation. XRP still holds recognition in the crypto space, but its growth is now tied to external decisions. Without strong internal developments or fresh updates, many traders are pausing. Interest is shifting to platforms that offer benefits based on user engagement rather than news. Cold Wallet stands out for this reason. While XRP‚Äôs future depends on ETF rulings, Cold Wallet is already a rewarding activity. With cashback and clear usage incentives, it offers a dependable alternative. It‚Äôs building steady traction, powered not by speculation but by function. As users look for projects offering more than just headlines, Cold Wallet is making its way to the top. Stellar Slows Down After Brief Rally Fails to Hold Stellar made waves with a massive 63% rally over the past week, briefly outperforming many other altcoins. The run was fueled by renewed interest in Stellar‚Äôs role in remittance services and increased trade volumes. However, the rally ran into resistance as prices neared $0.13. Now, many see the coin entering a sideways consolidation phase, suggesting that the move may have peaked. Even with fast transaction times and low fees, Stellar‚Äôs offerings no longer feel unique in today‚Äôs Layer 1 space. Without major changes or upgrades, it risks fading from attention. The excitement around Stellar‚Äôs rise may weaken unless backed by deeper ecosystem growth. Cold Wallet, on the other hand, doesn‚Äôt depend on price spikes. It rewards every transaction through cashback tiers. This utility-first model continues working even during sideways markets. While Stellar stalls, Cold Wallet gives active users a reason to stay engaged and earn with every action. Cold Wallet Turns Daily Crypto Use Into Cashback and 50x Returns Cold Wallet fixes one of crypto‚Äôs biggest problems, transaction fees that punish users for staying active. Most platforms take value from the user, especially on swaps, gas fees, or fiat ramps. Cold Wallet reverses that idea. Every action within the app earns $CWT, the utility coin that powers its cashback model. At Stage 16 of presale, it‚Äôs priced at $0.00942. The launch value is fixed at $0.3517, creating a return of 3,600% for early supporters. But the appeal isn‚Äôt just upside. Cold Wallet gives users a direct way to earn on activity. Holding more $CWT unlocks greater cashback rewards, up to 100%. No staking. No lock-ins. Just use the platform and earn. It includes four loyalty tiers: Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Diamond. Top-tier users receive full gas refunds and 50% cashback on swap and ramp fees. This system benefits people who actually use the wallet daily, not just large holders waiting on price moves. More than 682.8 million coins have already been sold, and the project has raised $5.6 million. With referral rewards that give both sides something and cashback that activates without delay, Cold Wallet is building a model centered on value returned to the user. It isn‚Äôt a wallet you just store crypto in, it‚Äôs one that works for you every day. Cold Wallet Brings Practical Value While Others Wait As XRP‚Äôs progress stalls due to delayed ETF news and Stellar‚Äôs rally hits resistance, Cold Wallet is quietly building something more sustainable. It rewards users for actual activity, not just holding. With a 3,600% ROI opportunity, cashback on fees, and over 682.8 million coins sold, it‚Äôs already proving itself. Cold Wallet doesn‚Äôt rely on speculation or external triggers. Its model puts value back in users‚Äô hands, creating daily utility that works across all market conditions. While other platforms wait for catalysts, Cold Wallet continues gaining traction through function, making it one of the most practical and promising presale crypto plays today.

(MHT), a company listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE). This massive acquisition, facilitated through a share purchase agreement with metallurgical company RIZAP Group, Inc., positions Bakkt as the largest shareholder of MHT. Incorporating Bitcoin Into MHT‚Äôs Treasury Management Plans As announced on Wednesday, part of this transaction will see Phillip Lord, the President of Bakkt International, assume the role of Chief Executive Officer at MHT. Under his leadership, MHT plans to incorporate Bitcoin (BTC) and other digital assets into its treasury management strategy. Furthermore, Bakkt has secured the domain name www.bitcoin.jp , which, pending approval from MarushoHotta‚Äôs shareholders, is set to become the new identity for the company. In a statement, Akshay Naheta, co-CEO of Bakkt, expressed enthusiasm for the opportunity, citing Japan‚Äôs regulatory environment as a favorable landscape for developing a Bitcoin-centric business model. He emphasized the intention to collaborate closely with MHT‚Äôs team to seamlessly integrate Bitcoin into their operational and financial framework , aiming to establish MHT as a foremost Bitcoin treasury company: Japan‚Äôs regulatory environment creates an ideal platform for a Bitcoin-centered growth business. We look forward to working with MHT‚Äôs team to integrate Bitcoin into their operating and financial model and to establish MHT as a leading Bitcoin treasury company. Bakkt Faces Setbacks As Stock Drops This acquisition aligns with Bakkt‚Äôs broader strategy to enhance its Bitcoin holdings. Recently, the company announced plans to raise up to $1 billion through various securities offerings, a move that reflects a growing trend among publicly traded companies to bolster their cryptocurrency reserves. The proposed offering includes shares of Class A common stock and pre-funded warrants, with underwriters being given a 30-day option to purchase an additional 15% of the shares sold, allowing for potential over-allotments. However, the timing, size, and terms of the offering remain contingent on market conditions. Despite these ambitious initiatives, Bakkt has encountered challenges. In March 2025, the company‚Äôs stock, BKKT , experienced a significant drop of 30% following news that two major clients, including Bank of America, would not be renewing their financial agreements with Bakkt. As of this writing, BKKT‚Äôs valuation closed Wednesday‚Äôs trading session at $9.77, up 2.5% for the day. However, the stock is trading over 70% below this year‚Äôs high of $31. Looking at a longer time frame, BKKT reached a record high of $1,271 in November 2021, which is nearly a 100% gap, further highlighting the firm‚Äôs challenges in recent years.

Meanwhile, the US is making significant progress toward its mission of becoming the crypto capital of the world. Despite this ambitious plan, concerns about potential capital flight are reportedly hindering the rapid advancement of stablecoin technology within the country. China Explores Stablecoin Initiatives According to a report from the Financial Times, Hong Kong has emerged as a testing ground for cryptocurrency, particularly given the strict bans on the mainland. Recently, the territory passed legislation allowing licensed businesses to issue tokens backed by any fiat currency. However, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has taken a cautious stance, indicating that only a limited number of licenses will be issued starting next year. Related Reading: Bitcoin Insult Alert: Pro Trader Dubs HODLers ‚ÄòIdiots,‚Äô Saylor Fires Back Policymakers in China have increasingly turned their attention to stablecoins, recognizing the growing dominance of dollar-backed tokens in the global economy. The central bank governor, Pan Gongsheng, noted in a June speech that stablecoins have ‚Äúfundamentally reshaped the traditional payment landscape.‚Äù However, the Chinese government faces a delicate balancing act; while it seeks to enhance the global standing of the renminbi, it must also maintain stringent controls over its financial system. Recent discussions among financial regulators have centered on the implementation of stablecoin projects, emphasizing that any such initiative must align with China‚Äôs unique national conditions. Yet, experts have cautioned that the risks associated with capital outflows could pose significant challenges. Interest Grows In Hong Kong Rebecca Liao, CEO of Saga, a company focused on blockchain infrastructure, articulated the complexities of adopting stablecoin technology, highlighting that it cannot be completely controlled by central authorities. This concern has contributed to Hong Kong‚Äôs slower progress in developing a thriving stablecoin market, especially when compared to the rapid growth observed in the United States. The HKMA has voiced apprehensions about the potential use of stablecoins in money laundering, emphasizing the need for stability and control in its new regulatory framework. As such, initial stablecoin programs in Hong Kong are expected to focus on business-to-business applications, limiting their broader adoption. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Bull Run In Jeopardy? Expert Reveals Strategy‚Äôs Alleged Plan To Sell All BTC Holdings The report emphasizes that interest in stablecoins is also growing among Chinese state-owned enterprises, particularly in the context of payment and settlement solutions. Multiple state-owned companies with operations in Hong Kong are reportedly looking to apply for stablecoin licenses, although only one of China‚Äôs four major state-owned banks is expected to receive a license from the HKMA in this initial phase. The HKMA has not ruled out the possibility of approving licenses for stablecoins backed by offshore renminbi, a move that could further facilitate cross-border payments‚Äîan area of increasing importance for China.

With Ripple‚Äôs banking initiative nearing launch and a potential XRP ETF approval looming, the crypto landscape is primed for movement. Seasoned traders know that dips often present the best buying opportunities‚Äîespecially when paired with strong catalysts. Among the altcoins gaining attention, MAGACOIN FINANCE has quietly emerged as a sleeper pick . Still in its presale stage, this low-cap project is drawing early comparisons to top performers from previous cycles. XRP‚Äôs ETF Catalyst and Bank License Fuel Buying Interest XRP has been regaining momentum as Ripple inches closer to resolving its long-running legal standoff with the U.S. SEC. A $50 million settlement is reportedly in the works, which would clear the path for institutional XRP sales. More significantly, rumors of an XRP ETF filing by BlackRock and other asset managers are ramping up. At the same time, Ripple‚Äôs push to secure a banking license is being viewed as a game-changing move. Analysts believe these developments could send XRP back toward the $3 range, with any ETF approval likely triggering a major rally akin to the Bitcoin ETF surge earlier this year. The Altcoin that Draws Early Whales Before Major Listings While large caps like XRP and ADA attract institutional buzz, MAGACOIN FINANCE is making waves in the high-ROI altcoin space. Currently in presale, the project has already recorded explosive early growth, with analysts projecting a potential 25x return if momentum continues. The MAGACOIN ecosystem is designed to blend meme coin virality with real-world utility, offering a hybrid approach that‚Äôs drawing strong community support. Investors are rushing to secure presale allocations before listings begin, citing similarities to early-stage PEPE and Shiba Inu‚Äîwith a more strategic roadmap in place. ADA Still Trading Far Below All-Time Highs‚ÄîBut Not for Long Cardano (ADA) has seen relatively quiet price action, but under the surface, excitement is building. The upcoming Midnight airdrop‚Äîa privacy-focused sidechain‚Äîis driving renewed interest in ADA holders. Historically, major network developments like this have preceded price rallies. Despite past underperformance compared to other top ten assets, ADA remains well below its all-time high near $3. Given its current positioning, any surge in usage or airdrop speculation could unlock a strong recovery, making ADA a solid mid-cap hold during this dip. Conclusion Market pullbacks often separate the emotional traders from the strategic ones. With XRP nearing a resolution, ADA gearing up for airdrop momentum, and MAGACOIN FINANCE blazing through its early stages with explosive projections , this dip may not last long. The smart money is already positioning.

A significant wave of Ethereum accumulation is underway, with institutional players and corporate treasuries making substantial moves into the ETH market. This trend signals a maturing digital asset landscape and could have profound implications for the future of the second-largest cryptocurrency. What‚Äôs Driving This Significant Spot ETH ETFs & Treasury Inflow? Nate Geraci, the respected president of NovaDius Wealth Management (formerly The ETF Store), recently shared compelling data on X. His report highlights a remarkable trend: since early June, companies holding Ethereum in their treasuries and newly emerging spot ETH ETFs have each acquired approximately 1.6% of the total Ethereum supply. This combined effort represents a staggering 3.2% of all ETH. Such a substantial absorption of tokens by these entities is a strong indicator of growing institutional confidence. It also suggests a long-term investment perspective rather than speculative trading. This steady inflow points to a strategic move by major players to secure a significant portion of the network‚Äôs native asset. It reflects a belief in Ethereum‚Äôs foundational technology and its potential for future growth. The Impact on ETH Supply and Market Dynamics When large entities like corporate treasuries and exchange-traded funds start buying up a significant percentage of an asset, it naturally impacts the available ETH supply . Here‚Äôs why this matters: Reduced Circulating Supply: As more ETH moves into long-term holdings and ETF reserves, less of it is available for day-to-day trading on exchanges. Potential Price Pressure: A reduced supply, coupled with sustained demand, can create upward pressure on Ethereum‚Äôs price over time. This is a fundamental economic principle. Market Validation: Institutional buying provides a strong vote of confidence. It validates Ethereum as a legitimate and valuable asset class, attracting further investment from traditional finance. This ongoing accumulation acts as a powerful signal to the broader market. It suggests that major financial players are increasingly comfortable allocating capital to digital assets, especially those with strong utility like Ethereum. Who Are These Ethereum Treasuries and Why Does It Matter? The term ‚Äò Ethereum treasuries ‚Äò refers to companies that hold ETH as part of their corporate reserves, similar to how they might hold cash, gold, or other traditional assets. This practice has gained traction as more businesses recognize the potential of blockchain technology and decentralized finance. Why is this significant? Diversification: Companies are diversifying their balance sheets with digital assets. Strategic Alignment: For many, holding ETH aligns with their business strategies, particularly those involved in Web3, NFTs, or DeFi. Long-Term Horizon: These are typically not short-term speculative plays but rather long-term strategic investments, implying a belief in Ethereum‚Äôs enduring value. The emergence of spot ETH ETFs also provides a regulated and accessible pathway for traditional investors to gain exposure to Ethereum without directly owning the cryptocurrency. This bridges the gap between traditional finance and the crypto market. The Future of Institutional Ethereum Investment: What‚Äôs Next? The recent surge in institutional Ethereum accumulation, highlighted by Nate Geraci‚Äôs report, paints a clear picture: major financial players are taking Ethereum seriously. This trend is likely to continue as regulatory clarity improves and more traditional investment vehicles become available. What can we expect going forward? Continued ETF Growth: As more spot ETH ETFs launch globally, they will likely continue to absorb a significant portion of the available supply. Broader Corporate Adoption: More companies may follow suit, adding ETH to their balance sheets as a hedge against inflation or as a strategic asset. Increased Market Stability: Large, long-term institutional holdings can contribute to greater market stability by reducing volatility often associated with retail speculation. This systematic accumulation by well-funded entities underscores Ethereum‚Äôs evolving role from a niche digital asset to a recognized, investable asset class within the global financial system. It‚Äôs a testament to the network‚Äôs robust ecosystem and its potential for widespread adoption. Conclusion: A New Era for Ethereum The collective efforts of spot ETH ETFs and corporate treasuries to acquire 3.2% of the total ETH supply since June mark a pivotal moment for Ethereum. This significant Ethereum accumulation by institutional players signals a profound shift in how traditional finance views and engages with digital assets. As more of the ETH supply is locked away in long-term holdings, the stage is set for a future where institutional Ethereum plays an even more dominant role in shaping the market. This ongoing trend not only validates Ethereum‚Äôs position but also paves the way for greater stability and mainstream integration. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Ethereum accumulation by treasuries and spot ETH ETFs? Ethereum accumulation by treasuries refers to companies holding ETH as part of their corporate balance sheets. Spot ETH ETFs are investment funds that hold actual Ethereum, allowing traditional investors to gain exposure without directly buying and storing the cryptocurrency. Both are actively acquiring significant amounts of ETH. Q2: How much of the total ETH supply has been acquired by these entities since June? According to Nate Geraci‚Äôs report, corporate treasuries and spot ETH ETFs have each acquired approximately 1.6% of the total ETH supply, leading to a combined Ethereum accumulation of roughly 3.2%. Q3: What impact does this accumulation have on the overall ETH supply? This significant accumulation reduces the amount of ETH supply available on exchanges for trading. This can lead to increased scarcity, potentially putting upward pressure on Ethereum‚Äôs price if demand remains strong or grows. Q4: Why are companies adding Ethereum to their treasuries? Companies are adding Ethereum to their Ethereum treasuries for various reasons, including diversification of assets, strategic alignment with Web3 or blockchain initiatives, and as a long-term investment believing in Ethereum‚Äôs future growth and utility. Q5: Does this institutional interest mean Ethereum is becoming more stable? Yes, the increasing involvement of institutional Ethereum investors, particularly those with long-term holding strategies, can contribute to greater market stability. Their large, less volatile holdings can help cushion price swings often associated with retail trading. Did you find this article insightful?

This technical retest comes as institutional momentum heats up: Satsuma Technology just raised $218 million in BTC-denominated funding, adding to a broader wave of long-term capital moving into Bitcoin. With higher lows forming since April and major players like pension funds and SBI Holdings expanding crypto exposure, the setup for a breakout toward $123K is becoming harder to ignore. Satsuma‚Äôs Bold Bitcoin Bet London-based Satsuma Technology has made headlines with a $217.6 million convertible credit note , the first of its kind in the UK to be fully subscribed in Bitcoin. This funding round, backed by Pantera Capital, Kraken, Blockchain.com, and UK asset managers overseeing more than ¬£300 billion, outperformed its target by 63%. JUST IN: Satsuma Technology raises $217.6M to expand Bitcoin treasury strategy. pic.twitter.com/t0bFAv80Qy ‚Äî ChainDesk (@ChainDesk_) August 6, 2025 Despite the positive momentum, Satsuma‚Äôs stock slipped 14%, a move analysts attribute to profit-taking and short-term volatility. CEO Henry Elder confirmed the capital will support their plan to fuse decentralized AI infrastructure via Bittensor with a Bitcoin-native treasury strategy. Currently holding 1,126 BTC at an average entry of $115,149, Satsuma‚Äôs position is nearly break-even, reflecting firm conviction in Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term trajectory amid broader market turbulence. The raise aligns with a growing macro trend: $7.8 billion in crypto asset acquisitions were disclosed last week, with $2.7 billion flowing into Bitcoin alone. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technical Setup Points to Breakout Bitcoin is showing notable technical strength. Price action around $114,980 is consolidating just above two key supports: The 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $112,860 Long-term ascending trendline stretching back to April. This confluence zone, where resistance has flipped into support, is often a bullish continuation signal. Bitcoin Price Chart ‚Äì Source: Tradingview RSI is about to cross above 50, which could be the start of the bullish momentum. The chart shows a broad ascending triangle with higher lows and accumulation below $123,206. A break above this level could unleash the buyers towards $131,337 and $138,680. If the trendline holds, it‚Äôs a stair-step rally. But if it breaks below $111,995 it could shift the sentiment and open the door for a drop to $105,225 or $99,500. Volume confirmation and a bullish engulfing candle above $115,000 would be the perfect entry for swing traders. BTC Trade Setup (Short-Term): Entry: Break above $115,000 Targets: $123,200 Stop-Loss: Below $113,800 If this triangle breakout confirms, bulls could regain control, especially if paired with renewed institutional inflows and ETF stability. Institutions Double Down on BTC In the U.S., the Michigan State Retirement System just tripled its Bitcoin ETF exposure, adding 200,000 shares of the ARK 21Shares BTC ETF to its portfolio, now valued at $11.4 million. This comes despite over $1.4 billion in outflows across U.S. ETFs last week, signaling long-term conviction. Michigan also holds $13.6 million in Grayscale‚Äôs Ethereum Trust , unchanged since 2024. Though crypto remains a small slice of its $19.3 billion portfolio, analysts say the Sharpe ratio for Bitcoin is increasingly attractive for pension strategies seeking asymmetric returns with manageable risk. Michigan State Pension Triples Bitcoin ETF Exposure, Latest Filing Shows ‚ñ∫ https://t.co/kllKdIYnpZ https://t.co/kllKdIYnpZ ‚Äî Decrypt (@DecryptMedia) August 6, 2025 Across the Pacific, Japan‚Äôs SBI Holdings is awaiting approval for the country‚Äôs first Bitcoin-XRP ETF. If greenlit, it would be listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange ‚Äî unlocking institutional access in a tightly regulated market. A second ETF, blending gold and crypto, is also in the pipeline. These developments could dramatically boost Asian inflows, especially if Japan‚Äôs Financial Services Agency reclassifies crypto under the FIEA statute ‚Äî a shift that could redefine institutional access across the region. What‚Äôs Next for BTC? With BTC holding support near $115K and institutional narratives strengthening across the U.S., U.K., and Japan, the foundation is set for a bullish continuation. If the ascending triangle plays out, Bitcoin could break through $123K resistance and revisit $131K or $138K in the near term and possibly set the stage for a Q4 run toward $250K or higher.

After a period of quiet, US spot Bitcoin ETFs have made a significant comeback. On August 6, these investment vehicles collectively saw a substantial net inflow of $91.52 million. This positive shift is particularly noteworthy as it broke a five-day streak of net outflows, signaling renewed investor confidence in the digital asset space and specifically in spot Bitcoin investment products. What Drove the Recent Bitcoin ETF Inflows? The latest data, shared by crypto analyst Trader T on X, paints a clear picture of this encouraging trend. The $91.52 million in total net inflows marks a decisive turn for Bitcoin ETF inflows . This isn‚Äôt just a small bump; it‚Äôs a significant indicator that institutional and retail interest in Bitcoin exposure through regulated channels is regaining momentum. BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT led the pack, attracting a robust $41.9 million in inflows. Bitwise‚Äôs BITB followed closely, securing $26.35 million. Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC , despite its higher fees, managed to pull in $14.5 million. Fidelity‚Äôs FBTC added $10.06 million to its coffers. VanEck‚Äôs HODL contributed with $4.08 million in inflows. Interestingly, not all funds experienced inflows. ARK Invest‚Äôs ARKB saw a net outflow of $5.37 million on the same day. However, the overall picture remains overwhelmingly positive, with the majority of major players showing strong net gains. Understanding BTC ETF Performance: A Closer Look This surge in inflows for US spot Bitcoin ETFs highlights a critical aspect of the evolving cryptocurrency market: the growing acceptance and integration of digital assets into traditional finance. Spot Bitcoin ETFs allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements without directly holding the cryptocurrency. This convenience and regulatory oversight are key attractions for a broad range of investors, from large institutions to individual traders. The daily flow data provides a real-time pulse of market sentiment. When funds like BlackRock and Fidelity, major players in traditional finance, see consistent inflows, it suggests a broader shift towards embracing Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. This positive BTC ETF performance can also influence broader market sentiment for Bitcoin itself, potentially leading to increased price stability or even upward momentum. What‚Äôs Next for Crypto ETF Trends? The August 6th inflows offer a glimmer of optimism, but what does this mean for future crypto ETF trends ? While one day‚Äôs data doesn‚Äôt establish a long-term pattern, it certainly provides a hopeful sign. Investors and analysts will be closely watching subsequent days‚Äô performance to see if this trend of net inflows continues or if it was an isolated event. Continued inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs could indicate: Increased Institutional Adoption: More institutions might be allocating capital to Bitcoin through these regulated products. Renewed Retail Interest: Individual investors, perhaps waiting for clearer market signals, might be re-entering the market. Market Maturity: The consistent use of ETFs suggests the market is maturing and becoming more accessible. However, it is important to remember that the crypto market remains volatile. External economic factors, regulatory news, and broader market sentiment can all impact these flows. Monitoring these trends is crucial for anyone involved in digital asset investment. Conclusion: A Positive Shift for Spot Bitcoin Investment The $91.52 million net inflow into US spot Bitcoin ETFs on August 6 is a welcome development for the cryptocurrency ecosystem. It marks an end to a period of outflows and showcases renewed confidence from investors across various funds. While the journey of digital assets in traditional finance is still unfolding, this positive turn in Bitcoin ETF inflows is a strong indicator of growing interest and potential stability for the market. It underscores the increasing importance of regulated investment products in making Bitcoin accessible to a wider audience, paving the way for further mainstream adoption. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a US spot Bitcoin ETF? A US spot Bitcoin ETF is an exchange-traded fund that directly holds Bitcoin. It allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements without having to buy and store the cryptocurrency themselves. These funds trade on traditional stock exchanges. Why are net inflows into Bitcoin ETFs important? Net inflows indicate that more money is entering these funds than leaving them. This suggests increasing investor demand and confidence in Bitcoin as an asset class, particularly through regulated investment vehicles. It can also be a positive sign for Bitcoin‚Äôs price. Which US spot Bitcoin ETFs saw the most inflows on August 6? On August 6, BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT led with $41.9 million in inflows, followed by Bitwise‚Äôs BITB ($26.35 million), Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC ($14.5 million), Fidelity‚Äôs FBTC ($10.06 million), and VanEck‚Äôs HODL ($4.08 million). Do all Bitcoin ETFs experience inflows? No, not all Bitcoin ETFs experience inflows simultaneously. On August 6, for example, ARK Invest‚Äôs ARKB saw net outflows. Fund performance can vary based on investor preference, fees, and specific fund strategies. How do Bitcoin ETF inflows impact the broader crypto market? Significant and sustained inflows into Bitcoin ETFs can signal growing institutional and retail interest, potentially leading to increased liquidity, greater price stability, and overall positive sentiment for Bitcoin and the wider cryptocurrency market.

Recently, U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs witnessed a remarkable influx of capital, with a combined net inflow of $34.15 million on August 6. This significant event marks the second consecutive trading day of positive flows, signaling growing investor confidence in Ethereum-backed financial products. This trend highlights a crucial shift in how traditional investors are engaging with the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. What‚Äôs Driving These Ethereum ETF Inflows? This impressive surge in Ethereum ETF inflows didn‚Äôt happen by chance. Data shared by Trader T reveals that key players are actively accumulating positions. Leading the charge was BlackRock‚Äôs ETHA, which alone attracted a substantial $32.41 million in inflows. This demonstrates strong institutional appetite for regulated crypto exposure. BlackRock‚Äôs ETHA: Dominant with $32.41 million in inflows. Grayscale‚Äôs ETHE: Added $10.04 million, showing continued interest in established products. ARK 21Shares‚Äô CETH: Contributed $0.37 million, rounding out the positive contributors. However, it wasn‚Äôt universally positive. Grayscale‚Äôs mini ETH experienced a net outflow of $8.67 million. This suggests some investors might be reallocating within their Ethereum holdings or optimizing their exposure strategies. Other ETFs reported no change in their holdings for the day, maintaining a steady stance. Understanding the Impact on ETH ETF Performance The consistent positive flow, particularly the second consecutive day of net inflows, is a strong indicator of robust ETH ETF performance . It reflects increasing comfort among institutional and retail investors with regulated vehicles for accessing Ethereum‚Äôs potential. This trend can lead to greater market stability and broader acceptance of digital assets. Why is this important? When large investment firms like BlackRock see significant inflows into their products, it often validates the underlying asset. For Ethereum, this means more capital is being directly channeled into its ecosystem, potentially boosting liquidity and market cap over time. It also signifies a maturing market where traditional finance is increasingly intertwined with decentralized technologies. How Do These Inflows Affect the Broader Crypto ETF Market? The success of U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs has ripple effects across the entire crypto ETF market . Positive performance in one segment, especially a major one like Ethereum, often inspires confidence in other digital asset products. This can pave the way for more diverse crypto ETF offerings in the future, expanding options for investors seeking exposure to various cryptocurrencies without direct ownership. This institutional embrace through ETFs helps bridge the gap between traditional finance and the volatile crypto world. It provides a regulated, accessible pathway for a wider range of investors, from large funds to individual retirement accounts, to participate in the growth of digital assets. This legitimization is crucial for the long-term health and expansion of the crypto market. The Future of Digital Asset Investment Looks Bright These recent inflows underscore a growing appetite for digital asset investment . The ability to invest in Ethereum through regulated ETF products offers significant advantages, including ease of access, liquidity, and oversight. As the market matures, we can expect to see continued innovation in financial products that cater to diverse investor needs. The transparency provided by ETF structures also builds trust. Investors can track holdings and performance easily, fostering a more informed and secure investment environment. This positive momentum for U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs could be a precursor to even greater institutional adoption and innovation in the broader digital asset space. In conclusion, the substantial $34.15 million in net inflows into U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs on August 6 marks a pivotal moment. Led by BlackRock, this trend signifies robust institutional confidence and a maturing market for digital asset investments. It‚Äôs a clear signal that Ethereum, through its ETF vehicles, is firmly establishing its place in mainstream finance, promising an exciting future for the crypto market.

In 2023, only 3% of respondents reported receiving any part of their salary in crypto. That figure jumped to 9.6% in 2024, as blockchain-native firms and DAOs increasingly turned to stablecoins and tokens to compensate employees and contributors. At the same time, the share of workers paid exclusively in fiat dropped from 97% to 89.1%. This shift shows a broader willingness among companies to integrate digital assets into day-to-day operations, particularly in roles that span borders or operate within decentralized ecosystems. Stablecoins Become Standard for Crypto Wages, USDC in Front Among those receiving crypto compensation, USDC was the dominant choice. The dollar-pegged stablecoin accounted for 63% of all crypto salaries, far outpacing USDT , which held a 28.6% share. Other tokens like Solana and Ethereum made up a smaller slice, with 1.9% and 1.3%, respectively. Our mission is to support the long-term success of both our portfolio companies and the broader crypto ecosystem. One major gap we‚Äôve consistently seen? Reliable, transparent compensation data for crypto teams. That‚Äôs why we created our annual Crypto Compensation Survey ‚Äì a‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Pantera Capital (@PanteraCapital) August 6, 2025 Pantera‚Äôs survey covers blockchain engineers, product managers, legal and operations staff across the industry. The results suggest that stablecoins are no longer limited to trading pairs or DeFi use cases, but are also becoming a practical tool for payroll and international payments. USDC Adoption in Payroll Strengthened by Monthly Reserve Disclosures Crypto compensation offers several advantages, especially for globally distributed teams. Stablecoins enable faster settlement times, lower transaction fees and easier access to US dollar value in regions with banking restrictions or currency instability. The findings also point to growing confidence in USDC‚Äôs reputation for regulatory compliance and transparency, particularly after Circle, its issuer, began publishing detailed monthly reserve reports and secured access to US Treasuries. More Workers Opt to Split Salaries Between Cash and Crypto While full salary payments in crypto remain uncommon, hybrid arrangements are gaining traction. Many firms now allow employees to split their compensation between fiat and digital assets, giving workers the option to dollar-cost average into crypto markets or spend directly using Web3 wallets. Pantera‚Äôs report did not disclose regional trends, but the surge in crypto salaries is likely driven in part by Asia-based teams and contractors who rely on stablecoins for cost-effective cross-border payments. The rise of on-chain compensation also comes as more crypto-native companies formalize operations. With better treasury management tools, real-time payroll rails and accounting platforms tailored for digital assets, the logistical barriers to paying in crypto are beginning to fall.

This major move by an address linked to James Wo, founder of the crypto venture capital firm DFG, has caught the attention of many, especially given the staggering crypto whale profit involved. This transaction highlights the dynamic nature of digital asset markets and the substantial gains possible for long-term holders. Unpacking the Massive James Wo ETH Sale: What Happened? An address believed to belong to James Wo has offloaded all its Ethereum holdings, marking a substantial transaction. Over the past two days, a total of 3,634.2 ETH, valued at approximately $13.29 million, found its way to Binance Exchange. This particular stash of Ethereum was accumulated back in February 2023, with an average acquisition cost of $1521.95 per ETH. The timing of this extensive James Wo ETH sale is notable, occurring after more than two years of holding these assets. This strategic divestment has resulted in an estimated profit of $7.796 million, a truly remarkable gain from their initial Ethereum holdings . Such a move by a prominent figure often sparks widespread discussion within the crypto community. The Role of On-Chain Analysis in Uncovering Major Moves How do we know about such large-scale transactions? This information comes to light thanks to meticulous on-chain analysis . Experts like @ai_9684xtpa on X actively monitor blockchain data, tracking the movement of significant cryptocurrency amounts. This transparency is a core feature of public blockchains, allowing anyone with the right tools to observe transactions. On-chain data provides invaluable insights into market trends, potential whale movements, and shifts in investor sentiment. It helps the community understand where large amounts of digital assets are moving and who might be behind those movements, even if identities are presumed rather than explicitly confirmed.

In July 2025, the blockchain payments giant filed for a charter to launch Ripple National Trust Bank, a limited-purpose national trust bank headquartered in New York. The goal: provide enterprise-grade custody, tokenization infrastructure, and stablecoin management‚Äîwithout operating as a traditional deposit-taking bank. The move includes a request for a Federal Reserve Master Account, which would allow Ripple to directly access the U.S. payment system for settlement, a leap forward in integrating crypto into traditional banking. While the bank is still awaiting final regulatory approval, the announcement has already reignited market speculation, particularly around Ripple‚Äôs native token XRP and major assets like Ethereum. Meanwhile, early-stage altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE are catching tailwinds from the broader surge in institutional interest. XRP Testing Key Levels as Market Eyes $3.69 Currently trading between $3.03 and $3.07, XRP recently broke out of a downward channel but is now facing resistance at $3.14 and $3.34. Technical analysts note that a clean breakout above $3.34 could trigger a move toward $3.69 or even higher, particularly if regulatory clarity continues to improve. Ripple‚Äôs proposed bank could accelerate XRP adoption by boosting institutional trust. With a dedicated infrastructure for safeguarding reserves, managing RLUSD (Ripple‚Äôs stablecoin), and facilitating cross-border payments, XRP could find itself at the center of a more regulated and scalable payment system. The bullish scenario? A legal victory combined with a banking license approval‚Äîtwo catalysts that could launch XRP toward new highs. Ethereum Approaches $4,000 as Bulls Take Control Ethereum is trading strong between $3,555 and $3,720. After gaining more than 40% in the past month, ETH is showing resilience amid broader market volatility. Key resistance lies at $3,881 and $4,234, and analysts remain bullish provided ETH continues to defend the $3,400 range. Ethereum stands to benefit indirectly from Ripple‚Äôs banking play as well, given the broader legitimization of tokenized infrastructure and blockchain-integrated banking services. With ETH‚Äôs growing presence in tokenized treasuries, stablecoins, and DeFi infrastructure, any movement toward regulatory clarity tends to strengthen Ethereum‚Äôs investment case. Momentum with Fresh Capital Rotation into Breakout Contenders Ripple‚Äôs growing institutional influence is prompting early investors to explore the next big opportunity‚Äîespecially among projects still in presale. That shift has brought major attention to MAGACOIN FINANCE, which has recently experienced a surge in whale inflows and early staking momentum. Ripple‚Äôs Trust Bank Launch Could Fuel MAGACOIN FINANCE 22,500% Gains‚ÄîOutpacing XRP Projections , according to some analysts. The project is riding the wave of rising institutional appetite with a meme-fueled narrative, early timing, and strategic accumulation that‚Äôs beginning to resemble early DOGE and SHIBA cycles. Investors seeking asymmetrical upside are watching MAGACOIN FINANCE closely as ETF-driven inflows trickle down to presale markets. Conclusion: Ripple‚Äôs Banking Play Sets the Stage Ripple‚Äôs National Trust Bank proposal isn‚Äôt just another crypto headline‚Äîit‚Äôs a signal that blockchain is entering Wall Street‚Äôs core financial architecture. If approved, it could catapult XRP and ETH to new heights‚Äîand in doing so, may fuel a new generation of breakout altcoins. MAGACOIN FINANCE is already capturing that energy, one wallet at a time.

Cardano (ADA) is holding strong near its support zone with slight upside, while Pi Coin (PI) is making headlines through wallet updates aimed at access and usability. Both show movement, but neither offers early access to real market tools or previews of in-action utilities. BlockDAG stands out. Using the TRADEBDAG code, buyers unlock a live trading simulator that mirrors real presale activity. This isn‚Äôt about future plans, it‚Äôs a hands-on experience now, giving users a better sense of what to expect post-launch. Among trending crypto coins, BlockDAG ‚Äôs utility-first approach clearly breaks the mold and brings more engagement early on. BlockDAG‚Äôs Live Simulator Previews Market Action! Most early-stage crypto projects rely on promises. BlockDAG flips the script. The TRADEBDAG code gives full access to its Trading Dashboard, a real-time simulator that previews actual BDAG trading post-launch. Users can view BDAG/USD price charts, track the live order book, and place trades that update wallet balances instantly. It brings a working prototype to users‚Äô hands now. This tool isn‚Äôt just about trying it out. It allows participants to build trading confidence and understand real market behavior before the official launch. The goal is to shift the presale from passive holding to full user interaction, which makes the experience more exciting and rewarding. BlockDAG‚Äôs GLOBAL LAUNCH release makes this more exciting. Although the current Batch 29 price is $0.0276, buyers can use the special GLOBAL LAUNCH rate of $0.0016 until August 11. This opens a potential 3,025% return, based on the confirmed $0.05 launch price. So far, $361 million has been raised, with over 24.7 billion coins sold. Batch 1 buyers have already seen a 2,660% ROI. As the presale momentum continues, BlockDAG proves it isn‚Äôt just selling a future idea. It‚Äôs showing exactly what‚Äôs coming next and why it matters for early access users. Pi Wallet Improves Access With Fiat Options A new Pi Wallet update is drawing fresh attention to Pi Coin (PI), especially with features designed to improve access. The wallet now supports payments through Apple Pay, Google Pay, and debit cards via Banxa and Onramper. This lowers the entry barrier and makes it easier for users to buy PI with fiat. The update also added a ‚ÄúBUY‚Äù button, streamlining user experience and hinting at broader adoption goals. There are also signs that the wallet may support other digital assets soon, which would give it a role beyond the Pi ecosystem. That could reshape how users interact with it long term. Together, these upgrades highlight a broader shift in PI‚Äôs direction. The team is clearly focused on improving access, building infrastructure, and supporting mainstream use. While exchange listings are still pending, the current updates help PI stay visible among trending crypto picks that focus on usability and interface experience. ADA Bounces Back From $0.69 Support Cardano (ADA) dropped from $0.83 to nearly $0.69 between July 28 and August 2, showing six straight days of red candles. This drop tested the long-standing $0.69 support level and caught traders‚Äô attention due to its consistent decline. Since then, ADA has recovered with two green sessions and now trades close to $0.73. ADA is currently stuck inside a multi-year symmetrical triangle. Analysts are watching the $0.72 to $0.73 range as a key breakout zone. If ADA moves higher, it could touch $0.75 or even $0.80 soon. Under the right conditions, some targets stretch as far as $0.96 by the end of August. Despite recent pressure, ADA‚Äôs ability to hold support has caught attention. It remains one of the top coins with long-term upside as traders track potential breakout levels, especially while larger altcoins move sideways or struggle to reclaim momentum. The Bottom Line Pi Coin (PI) is gaining users through wallet updates. Cardano (ADA) is holding its ground at support. But neither gives access to real-time trading before the next phase or lets users test anything ahead of listings. BlockDAG does. The TRADEBDAG code unlocks full use of its Trading Dashboard, where buyers can view price charts, place trades, and see wallet balances shift live. It‚Äôs not just testing, it‚Äôs real-time simulation based on current presale activity, which provides early training and excitement. For those looking at top crypto coins right now, BlockDAG offers a working product, not just future potential. With its $0.0016 GLOBAL LAUNCH release valid till August 11, BlockDAG puts real tools and opportunity directly in users‚Äô hands, turning curiosity into real engagement before market listings go live.

49671163,549656,1754535656,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49671163.jpeg,Worldcoin in the Spotlight Again as China Warns of Biometric Data Threats,https://bitcoinist.com/worldcoin-in-spotlight-again-china-warns-biometric/,"China‚Äôs Ministry of State Security (MSS) has raised alarms over a foreign company‚Äôs (likely Worldcoin) collection of biometric data from users in exchange for cryptocurrency rewards, calling the practice a potential threat to both individual privacy and national security. The warning, published Wednesday on the agency‚Äôs official WeChat account, pointed to documented cases of large-scale iris data collection linked to crypto token distributions . While the MSS did not explicitly name the project, the description closely aligns with Worldcoin, a project developed by Tools for Humanity. Worldcoin has gained attention for using its ‚Äúorb‚Äù devices to scan users‚Äô irises to create unique digital IDs and distribute its cryptocurrency token, WLD. According to the MSS, the transfer of these sensitive data sources to external entities ‚Äúposes risks not only to personal privacy but also to the country‚Äôs national security,‚Äù as biometric information can potentially be exploited beyond its stated purpose. Growing Global Scrutiny of Biometric Crypto Projects China‚Äôs warning adds to mounting global scrutiny over biometric data collection in the digital asset industry. Worldcoin, launched in 2023, has faced investigations and regulatory actions in multiple jurisdictions, primarily over concerns surrounding data protection and user consent. In May, Indonesian authorities suspended the project‚Äôs operating permit following reports of irregularities related to Worldcoin‚Äôs identity verification services. Tools for Humanity later stated that World voluntarily paused its proof-of-personhood operations in Indonesia while seeking clarity on licensing requirements . This is not the first time China has voiced concerns about crypto-linked risks. The country has long maintained strict policies on digital asset trading and initial coin offerings (ICOs), emphasizing consumer protection and financial stability. Last month, Shenzhen‚Äôs financial regulator issued an alert warning citizens about fraudulent schemes disguised as stablecoin investments. The MSS statement expands the scope of concern, highlighting how biometric data collection linked to crypto incentives can cross into national security territory, particularly if foreign entities manage or store sensitive information. Implications for Privacy and Regulation in the Crypto Space The latest development reflects a broader debate around privacy, identity verification, and decentralized finance. Projects like Worldcoin argue that iris scans enable a secure and scalable method of proving human identity online, which could help distinguish real users from automated bots in Web3 applications. Critics, however, have cautioned that once biometric data is collected, the risk of misuse or unauthorized access remains high, even if encrypted or anonymized. China‚Äôs public statement suggests that the country may increase oversight of foreign crypto projects operating within its jurisdiction or collecting data from Chinese nationals. This aligns with global regulatory trends, where authorities are seeking to strike a balance between technological innovation and the protection of sensitive personal information. In Europe, data regulators have opened probes into Worldcoin‚Äôs activities under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), while Kenya temporarily halted Worldcoin registrations over similar privacy concerns in 2023. The MSS has urged the public to exercise caution when approached with offers to exchange personal data for cryptocurrency rewards.

Some analysts suggest that the cryptocurrency is preparing for a massive rally. Related Reading: Solana To Drop Before The ‚ÄòReal Move‚Äô? Analyst Forecasts New Highs In Q3 Cardano Retests Key Resistance Following last week‚Äôs drop to the $0.70 support, Cardano is attempting to break out of a crucial resistance level to continue its rally. The cryptocurrency has surged 8.8% from Friday‚Äôs low, retesting the $0.74-$0.76 area throughout this week. Notably, ADA has been hovering between the $0.65-$0.85 price range since the Q2 market recovery, briefly losing this area during the June pullback. However, the July market pump sent the altcoin to a four-month high of $0.93, sparking bullish sentiment among investors. Since then, Cardano has been in a downtrend, attempting to break out of the descending resistance for the past two weeks. Market watcher Sebastian noted that the cryptocurrency has repeatedly retested the $0.76 zone over the past few days, suggesting that ‚Äúthe more it tests it, the higher the likelihood to break it.‚Äù According to the analyst, ADA must reclaim the 50-day Moving Average (MA), which has served as a strong resistance and support level and coincides with the descending resistance breakout area. Following today‚Äôs performance, the altcoin has reclaimed the 50 MA indicator and eyes a retest of the $0.76 resistance. A breakout from this level would set the stage for a retest of the next crucial area between $0.79 and $0.80. ‚ÄúGetting back above $0.80 would confirm the trend reversal,‚Äù Sebastian affirmed. Meanwhile, a rejection from this area could propel Cardano to retest the recent lows and risk losing its local range again. ADA Breakout Eyes 85%-120% Rally Man of Bitcoin noted ADA‚Äôs recent performance, asserting that it is ‚Äúnow potentially working on a small 1-2 setup.‚Äù Based on this, he suggested that ‚Äúas long as the price remains above the last swing low at $0.685, wave-5 of iii should follow next.‚Äù Meanwhile, analyst Ali Martinez highlighted that the cryptocurrency has been trading within a descending channel since its December 2024 high of $1.32. According to the chart, ADA retested the channel‚Äôs upper boundary for the first time in months during the July breakout but was ultimately rejected. Reclaiming the $0.76 could propel the altcoin to the channel‚Äôs resistance, and ‚Äúa breakout above $0.84 could set Cardano on a path toward $1.30.‚Äù Additionally, Martinez asserted that ‚ÄúADA is showing the same price structure as the last cycle, only this time, it‚Äôs unfolding more gradually. And it feels like we‚Äôre right at the beginning of an explosive move.‚Äù Similarly, Crypto Bullet stated that Cardano has been following a pattern over this cycle. Per the chart, the cryptocurrency has been trading down for months before breaking out and reaching new local highs. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin‚Äôs Price Discovery Rally Over? This Week‚Äôs Performance May Hold The Answer Last month, the cryptocurrency broke out of its eight-month downtrend, targeting a rally toward the $1.60 area.

As of this writing, Cardano is trading at $0.74, a 3% increase in the daily timeframe.

For traders engaged in derivatives, understanding market mechanics is crucial. Today, we delve into a critical indicator: the crypto perpetual futures liquidation data from the past 24 hours. This breakdown offers a fascinating glimpse into recent market volatility and prevailing market sentiment . What Exactly is Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation? In the world of derivatives, a perpetual future is a type of futures contract that has no expiration date. This allows traders to hold leveraged positions indefinitely. However, leverage comes with inherent risk. When a trader‚Äôs position falls below a certain margin requirement, it triggers a ‚Äúliquidation.‚Äù Essentially, their position is automatically closed by the exchange to prevent further losses. This is a crucial aspect of the perpetual futures market . Our focus here is on short liquidations . A short position profits when the asset price goes down. Conversely, if the price unexpectedly rises sharply, these short positions face liquidation. High short liquidations often indicate a ‚Äúshort squeeze,‚Äù where a sudden price increase forces many short sellers to close their positions, further fueling the price rally. Decoding the Latest 24-Hour Crypto Liquidations The past 24 hours have seen significant activity in the perpetual futures market , particularly concerning liquidations. Here‚Äôs a detailed look at the breakdown: ETH: $60.27 million in liquidations, with a dominant 62.65% being short positions. This suggests a notable upward price movement for Ethereum, catching many short sellers off guard. BTC: $22.29 million in liquidations, with an even higher 75.45% being short positions. Bitcoin experienced a strong surge that led to substantial losses for those betting on a price decline. MYX: $13.13 million in liquidations, with 66.58% being short positions. This altcoin also saw a significant number of short positions wiped out, reflecting similar market dynamics. These figures highlight a clear trend: a strong upward movement in these assets, leading to the forced closure of numerous short positions. The overwhelming percentage of short liquidations across all three assets points to a market that moved decisively against bearish bets, impacting overall market sentiment . Why Do Short Liquidations Dominate the Perpetual Futures Market? The dominance of short liquidations in this 24-hour period reveals a specific kind of market action. When a large number of traders are betting on prices to fall, a sudden positive catalyst or significant buying pressure can trigger a chain reaction. As prices rise, short positions quickly become unprofitable. Exchanges then step in, liquidating these positions to protect themselves and maintain market stability. This forced buying to close short positions further accelerates the price increase, creating a ‚Äúshort squeeze.‚Äù It‚Äôs a powerful phenomenon that can lead to rapid upward price spikes, as observed in the recent crypto liquidations data. Understanding this dynamic is key to interpreting current market sentiment . Actionable Insights from Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation Data For traders, monitoring crypto perpetual futures liquidation data is more than just observing numbers; it‚Äôs about gaining strategic insights. High short liquidations can signal a strong underlying buying pressure or a market turning point where bearish sentiment is being overwhelmed. Conversely, high long liquidations would suggest a market correction or a significant downturn. What can you do with this information? Firstly, it emphasizes the importance of robust risk management, especially when using leverage. Secondly, it provides a real-time pulse on current market sentiment . If short liquidations are consistently high, it might indicate a resilient market ready to push higher, or at least one that is punishing overly bearish bets. Always combine this data with other technical and fundamental analysis for a comprehensive trading strategy. In conclusion, the past 24 hours provided a stark reminder of the volatility and potential for sharp movements within the crypto market. The substantial short liquidations across ETH, BTC, and MYX underscore a period where bullish momentum surprised many bearish traders. Monitoring these trends offers valuable insights into the market‚Äôs underlying strength and the risks associated with leveraged trading. Stay informed, stay strategic. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is crypto perpetual futures liquidation? A1: Crypto perpetual futures liquidation occurs when a trader‚Äôs leveraged position in a perpetual futures contract falls below a certain margin requirement. The exchange automatically closes the position to prevent further losses, protecting both the trader and the market. Q2: Why were short liquidations so high in the last 24 hours? A2: High short liquidations indicate that many traders betting on price declines (short positions) were caught off guard by a sudden upward price movement. This often leads to a ‚Äúshort squeeze,‚Äù where forced buying to cover positions further fuels the price increase. Q3: How does liquidation impact the crypto market? A3: Liquidations can amplify price movements. A wave of crypto liquidations can accelerate a rally (if shorts are liquidated) or a crash (if longs are liquidated), leading to increased volatility and rapid shifts in market sentiment . Q4: What does this data mean for an average trader? A4: For an average trader, this data underscores the inherent risks of leveraged trading and highlights the importance of risk management. It also provides insight into the prevailing market momentum; high short liquidations suggest bullish strength and a market punishing bearish bets. Q5: Is it possible to avoid liquidation? A5: While not always entirely avoidable in extreme market conditions, traders can significantly reduce the risk of liquidation by using lower leverage, setting stop-loss orders, and maintaining sufficient margin in their accounts. Proper risk management is key in the perpetual futures market . Did you find this breakdown helpful?

The cryptocurrency's 30-day implied volatility, as represented by Volmex's BVIV index, fell to an annualized 36.5% late on Wednesday, reaching levels last seen in October 2023, when BTC was trading below $30,000, according to data source TradingView. The new multi-year low in implied volatility suggests that options traders are not yet rushing for hedges, despite U.S. economic data raising concerns about stagflation. The demand for options, which are contracts used to hedge against or profit from price swings, is a major driver of an asset's implied volatility. The same thing can be said about stocks, where the VIX index has reversed Friday's spike from 17 to 21. The VIX measures the 30-day implied volatility in the S&P 500. BTC mirrors stock market volatility patterns BTC's implied volatility has been in a months-long downtrend, moving in the opposite direction of the cryptocurrency's price, which has surged from $70,000 to over $110,000 since November. The negative correlation marks a profound shift in bitcoin's market dynamics. Historically, BTC's volatility and its spot price moved in tandem, with volatility rising in both bull and bear markets. The change in this spot-volatility correlation is attributed, in part, to the growing popularity of structured products that involve the writing (selling) of out-of-the-money call options, analysts told CoinDesk . This new dynamic suggests that bitcoin is increasingly mirroring patterns on Wall Street, where implied volatility often dwindles during steady bull runs.

With the SEC recently greenlighting the ProShares Ultra XRP ETF (UXRP), attention has shifted to spot ETF approval odds, now pegged at 85% for September or October 2025. This development is sparking fresh DOGE capital rotation and highlighting new altcoin breakout stories. MAGACOIN FINANCE, a rising name in the current altcoin rotation after XRP ETF news, is capturing interest from investors seeking high potential altcoin plays and outsized returns. XRP ETF Buzz Drives Market Shifts The SEC‚Äôs approval of the ProShares Ultra XRP ETF, a 2x leveraged futures-based fund, signals new momentum for XRP. With formal listing standards now in place, traders are positioning ahead of a possible spot ETF debut. XRP and DOGE investor shift patterns show heavy rotation into altcoins gaining ETF spillover as institutional and retail players bet on further regulatory progress. Industry analysts are closely watching the odds of a spot XRP ETF in late 2025. Many believe this move could unlock new inflows and intensify crypto market rotation, especially among high-potential altcoins tied to emerging crypto opportunities. As a result, XRP investors are increasingly reallocating to new narratives, searching for the next big opportunity to capture gains from the shifting ETF landscape. DOGE Investor Trends, Capital Rotation Sparks New Breakout Dogecoin is another major beneficiary of the current environment. DOGE investor trends show sharp upticks in both accumulation and trading volume, as meme coin sentiment rallies on the back of ETF speculation. Social channels are tracking a visible DOGE capital rotation, with traders seeking high potential altcoin breakouts connected to market-wide volatility. Altcoin rotation after ETF headlines has not only lifted DOGE but also boosted several new projects. Emerging crypto opportunities now share the spotlight, with analysts highlighting meme coins and high potential altcoin entries as must-watch for this cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE Accumulation Builds as XRP ETF Speculation Boosts Altcoin Sentiment MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly rising as accumulation surges among altcoin traders. This new contender stands out in the altcoin rotation after XRP ETF news, drawing in both meme coin enthusiasts and risk-on capital. Analysts project MAGACOIN FINANCE could target 15,400% gains, thanks to a blend of strong community activity, high engagement across social platforms, and sharp increases in wallet growth. Much of this momentum is linked to the spillover from DOGE and XRP ETF speculation, as traders search for a high potential altcoin that hasn‚Äôt yet run. Accumulation data reveals steady inflows as crypto market rotation picks up speed, putting MAGACOIN FINANCE firmly on lists of new altcoin breakout candidates. For investors tracking emerging crypto opportunities, MAGACOIN FINANCE is viewed as a fresh, high-upside target with the right blend of narrative and volatility to fuel the next major move. Wrapping Up XRP ETF speculation is fueling broad capital rotation, shifting attention toward both DOGE and new altcoin breakouts. DOGE investor trends and XRP and DOGE investor shift patterns show that high potential altcoin picks are now in the spotlight. MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out among the current wave, building rapid momentum and targeting 15,400% gains as accumulation grows. For those looking for the next big move during this cycle of altcoin rotation after XRP ETF news, MAGACOIN FINANCE is an emerging story to watch.

But not all of them have value. What matters more are the projects with real use and strong potential for gains. For people new to crypto, knowing which ones to trust can be difficult. This list highlights four top performing crypto projects in July that showed clear signs of momentum: Cold Wallet, Solana, SUI, and Hedera. Each has a different purpose, but all of them are gaining interest as the market looks ahead. 1. Cold Wallet: Gaining Speed with Strong Funding and Features Cold Wallet is taking a different path from most wallets, which is helping it become a top performing crypto. While most wallets only store assets, Cold Wallet pays users for staying active. It offers cashback in CWT for every swap, bridge, or ramp. There is also a referral system and reward tiers that increase these earnings. The early response to the presale shows interest is growing. Cold Wallet has already raised over $5.7 million in a few weeks. Whale wallets are starting to get involved. Right now, Stage 16 prices CWT at $0.00942, and the listing is confirmed at $0.3517. This gives early users a possible return of 4,900%. What also drives this growth is the $270 million purchase of Plus Wallet, which added a large user base right away. This move shows Cold Wallet is planning for long-term scale. With working features, strong backing, and a major merger already done, Cold Wallet is setting itself apart as a smart option in this cycle. 2. Solana‚Äôs Continued Growth Shows Long-Term Promise Solana continues to be one of the top performing crypto assets, with its price now at $169.45. After recovering from earlier issues, the network has become one of the busiest in the space. Thanks to its fast speeds and low fees, it supports a wide range of use cases from NFTs to DeFi. User activity stays strong every day, and developers are still building actively on the network. It is even challenging Ethereum in daily usage, but without the higher costs. Projects like Stepn, Helium, and Jupiter Exchange are growing on Solana, adding to its ecosystem. With consistent growth and strong use in the real world, Solana‚Äôs pace is hard to overlook. 3. SUI Gains Attention with Developer-Friendly Features SUI is trading at $0.77 and is showing steady momentum as a newer Layer 1 network that focuses on user experience and speed. Supported by Mysten Labs and built using the Move language, SUI gives developers more flexibility when creating dApps. This flexibility helps SUI stand out in areas such as gaming, lending, and DeFi applications. Its total value locked continues to rise, and new launches are bringing in activity. Even though it is newer compared to platforms like Solana or Ethereum, its early position could be its biggest strength. Current trends suggest SUI is one of the top performing crypto assets to keep an eye on. 4. Hedera Builds Enterprise Use Through Real Adoption Hedera (HBAR), priced at $0.078, also makes the list of top performing crypto assets this week. Its edge comes from actual usage in real-world business settings. Built on Hashgraph, not traditional blockchain, Hedera delivers speed, fixed transaction costs, and low energy usage. This makes it ideal for large companies building at scale. Industries such as healthcare, identity systems, and supply chains are already using Hedera. Well-known companies like IBM, Google, and Dell are part of its Governing Council, showing strong support. Rather than being just another altcoin, Hedera is turning into important infrastructure for future use. Comparing These Projects for 2025 Potential Solana stays ahead with its fast network, low fees, and consistent builder activity. SUI is rising fast with its focus on developer tools, new product growth, and strong potential. At the same time, Hedera is becoming a key player in enterprise use with support from major companies and working systems in place. Still, for those looking at potential gains, Cold Wallet is making waves. Stage 16 has CWT priced at $0.00942, and its planned listing price is $0.3517, showing a 4,900% return for early buyers. This is not just guesswork. The $270 million buyout of Plus Wallet instantly brought in a large and active user base. For those exploring the next top performing crypto , Cold Wallet stands out with real progress, strong early backing, and a system built to scale. Getting in early could make a major difference in outcomes.

49672234,549842,1754539209,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49672234.jpeg,"Ethereum, Not Bitcoin, May Be The Future‚Äôs Preferred Store Of Value ‚Äì VanEck Report",https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-bitcoin-store-value-vaneck-report/,"In its July 2025 crypto monthly recap report, global investment management firm VanEck suggested that Ethereum (ETH) could emerge as a superior store of value compared to Bitcoin (BTC). The report pointed to ETH‚Äôs lower inflation rate in recent months relative to BTC, alongside its growing utility within decentralized finance (DeFi). Ethereum A Better Store Of Value Than Bitcoin? In recent years, a growing number of companies have diversified their treasuries by allocating capital to digital assets ‚Äì most notably Bitcoin. However, emerging trends show that corporations are also beginning to accumulate Ethereum, recognizing its potential as both a yield-generating and deflationary asset. VanEck‚Äôs report emphasizes that while Bitcoin‚Äôs finite supply and predictable issuance policies make it a strong candidate for a store of value, Ethereum provides greater financial flexibility. In particular, ETH holders can stake their assets to earn rewards, collect network revenue, and participate in DeFi protocols to generate additional yield. The report also highlights key differences in the monetary policies of both networks. Ethereum‚Äôs initial issuance rate at launch was 14.4%, compared to Bitcoin‚Äôs 9.3%. However, two major policy changes have since dramatically reduced ETH‚Äôs inflation rate ‚Äì bringing it below Bitcoin‚Äôs. The first was Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP-1559), implemented in August 2021, which introduced a mechanism to ‚Äúburn‚Äù a portion of transaction fees. This effectively created deflationary pressure during periods of high network activity, reducing the total supply of ETH. The second transformative event was ‚ÄúThe Merge‚Äù in September 2022, when Ethereum transitioned from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. This change drastically reduced issuance ‚Äì from approximately 13,000 ETH/day to around 1,700 ETH/day ‚Äì by eliminating the need to pay miners. Following these changes, ETH‚Äôs inflation rate fell below Bitcoin‚Äôs for the first time in March 2023. Since then, ETH‚Äôs supply has grown by only 0.2%, compared to Bitcoin‚Äôs 3%. The report states: Total supply of ETH fell between October 7th, 2022, and April 4th, 2024, moving from ~120.6M on to a low of ~120.1M on, achieving an annualized (-0.25%) inflation rate over the period. Since that time, ETH burn has been reduced due to the increase in Ethereum transaction throughput, and the network has accrued (+0.5%) in additional supply. Regardless, over that same period, BTC supply has increased (+1.1%). Companies Flocking To ETH Accumulation Over the past month, several companies have unveiled Ethereum-focused treasury strategies. For instance, cryptocurrency firm Bit Digital recently crossed 120,000 ETH in total holdings. Meanwhile, Bitcoin mining firm BitMine Immersion Technologies revealed that its ETH holdings had surged past 833,000 tokens, making it the largest known corporate holder of the digital asset. At press time, ETH trades at $3,643, up 2.3% in the past 24 hours.",Ethereum|Altcoin|bitcoin|btc|Cryptocurrency|EIP-1559|ETH|Ether|Ethereum inflation|ethereum issuance rate|ETHUSDT|Store of value,EN,0,0,ETH|BTC|MACROECONOMICS|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-07 04:00:09
49672274,https://thecoinrise.com/top-crypto-to-buy-now-blockdag-extends-lead-over-ethereum-solana-toncoin/,1754539226,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecoinrise.png,"Top Crypto to Buy Now: BlockDAG Extends Lead Over Ethereum, Solana & Toncoin",https://thecoinrise.com/top-crypto-to-buy-now-blockdag-extends-lead-over-ethereum-solana-toncoin/,"The market is full of opportunities, but picking the right ones is what makes all the difference. This month, a mix of presale gems and established names is catching the attention of traders and long-term holders alike. BlockDAG is offering one of the lowest entry points we‚Äôve seen in a presale with high ROI potential, while Ethereum keeps drawing institutional money, Solana has become a key player in staking and futures markets, and Toncoin is building on deep ecosystem partnerships. If you‚Äôre looking for the best crypto to buy, this list gives you a clear breakdown of what‚Äôs trending now, why these coins are worth watching, and how they‚Äôre positioned for the months ahead. 1. BlockDAG: A Presale with Real Tools and Big Incentives BlockDAG is offering one of the most exciting presale setups we‚Äôve seen in 2025. With approximately $363 million already raised and around 24.6 billion tokens sold, it‚Äôs clear that demand is strong. The temporary $0.0016 tier running until August 11 is a big draw, especially when compared to the current batch price of $0.0276 and the planned $0.05 listing price. This gives early buyers a chance at an impressive 3,000% potential ROI. On top of this, BlockDAG has launched a 10 BTC auction prize pool worth about $1.1 million, where rewards are distributed proportionally to the amount purchased. This combination of low entry pricing and direct incentives is designed to push engagement in the final days of the presale. The project also goes beyond traditional token sales. Its Dashboard V4 simulates a live trading environment with real-time BDAG/USD charts, functional order books, wallet updates, and instant buy/sell features. This gamified setup allows participants to test strategies and get comfortable with the interface before launch. Combined with a growing community of over 2 million users mining through its X1 Mobile Miner, BlockDAG is setting up a full-fledged ecosystem even before listing. If you‚Äôre deciding on the best crypto to buy, BlockDAG‚Äôs mix of value pricing, training tools, and community incentives make it a standout choice. 2. Ethereum: Strong Institutional Backing Ethereum remains one of the best crypto to buy as its position in the market continues to strengthen. Currently trading between $3,600 and $3,700, ETH has been on an upswing, gaining around 54% over the past month and outperforming Bitcoin‚Äôs 10% rise. Even with a significant $465 million ETF outflow from BlackRock‚Äôs ETHA on August 4, corporate treasuries now hold close to 966,000 ETH, worth about $3.5 billion, up from just 116,000 ETH at the end of 2024. This shows confidence from institutions, many of which are also attracted to Ethereum‚Äôs staking yields of around 3‚Äì4%. Regulatory developments are another tailwind. With the GENIUS Act and stablecoin legislation in motion, Ethereum is becoming a preferred choice for corporates and institutions looking for a reliable asset. Analysts believe it has the potential to test resistance levels around $4,100 and possibly move toward its all-time high of $4,865. With a robust network, consistent upgrades, and deep institutional adoption, Ethereum is cementing its place as a cornerstone crypto investment for 2025. 3. Solana: Institutional Demand and Key Price Levels Solana is proving why it deserves attention, especially if you‚Äôre considering the best crypto to buy in 2025. Trading between $165 and $170, SOL has seen a sharp rise in institutional activity. CME futures open interest for Solana has climbed to $800 million, a massive 370% increase month-over-month, and the first U.S. Solana staking ETF has already launched. Adding to this momentum, Bit Mining recently invested $5 million in SOL and unveiled plans to raise $300 million for Solana treasury and infrastructure projects. On-chain data shows whales are accumulating, with $52 million in recent withdrawals from exchanges, and nearly 43% of holders are sitting at unrealized losses, signaling possible strong hands taking advantage of current price levels. Technically, Solana is at a key support range between $165 and $170. A sustained breakout above $171 could set it up for a rally toward $200 or even higher long-term targets of $900 if bullish momentum builds. These factors make Solana a coin to watch closely in the coming weeks. 4. Toncoin: Building Big Partnerships Toncoin is holding steady around $3.6‚Äì3.7 and has grown 24% over the past month. It‚Äôs quickly becoming a project to watch, especially after the TON Foundation secured a $400 million institutional treasury partnership. DeFi platform STON.fi also raised $9.5 million to enhance cross-chain functionality, boosting Toncoin‚Äôs utility. One of the most talked-about developments is Nasdaq-listed Verb Technology raising $558 million to launch the first public Toncoin treasury, with the deal closing by August 7. This growth is closely tied to Toncoin‚Äôs deep integration with Telegram, which rolled out TON Wallet access to its 87 million U.S. users. While some analysts predict a possible pullback to $2.62 in the short term, others see this as a chance for strategic entry before the ecosystem expands further. Combined with its growing visibility and institutional adoption, Toncoin offers both short-term volatility and long-term upside, making it one of the more interesting picks in today‚Äôs market. Summing Up If you‚Äôre evaluating the best crypto to buy , these four are hard to ignore. BlockDAG stands out with its $0.0016 presale tier, interactive trading dashboard, and 10 BTC auction, creating strong FOMO for those who don‚Äôt want to miss out before August 11. Ethereum continues to attract big money and regulatory support, strengthening its market position. Solana is showing powerful institutional demand and promising price action at critical levels. Toncoin‚Äôs ecosystem growth and deep Telegram integration make it a compelling choice for those willing to ride out its volatility. Together, these projects show the variety of opportunities the current market offers, whether you want a high-ROI presale, a trusted long-term asset, or a project with bold ecosystem plans.

This remarkable technical performance provides the foundation for the collaboration with Perplexity, demonstrating Artprice‚Äôs ability to integrate and make the most of the most advanced AI technologies. Artprice‚Äôs databases, with over 880,000 listed artists and more than 30 million auction results spanning three centuries of art history since 1700, represent the world‚Äôs most comprehensive informational heritage in the artistic field. This patrimonial wealth, enriched by 181 million images and managed through partnerships with 7,200 auction houses worldwide, creates a unique data ecosystem that, combined with Perplexity‚Äôs real-time search capabilities, generates unprecedented synergies. Technological Assessment and Selection of Perplexity as a Strategic Partner Comprehensive Evaluation Process and Informed Technology Choice In its research and development activities, Artprice maintains an active technological watch by subscribing to practically all the main AI platforms available on the market, ensuring a continuous strategic overview of AI developments. This thorough evaluation approach, led under the direction of Thierry Ehrmann, founder and AI specialist since 1987, with his IT teams, enables Artprice to maintain deep expertise in assessing the performance, accuracy, and reliability of AI platforms. Based on this comprehensive evaluation of over 20 leading AI platforms, Artprice determined that Perplexity‚Äôs approach‚Äîparticularly through its Premium Perplexity Labs service‚Äîrepresents the most advanced AI technology currently available. The differentiating criteria identified include Perplexity‚Äôs error rate, close to zero and unmatched to date, and its systematic methodology of citing official sources with URLs, offering the transparency and verifiability that Artprice requires for professional art market analysis. Advanced Technological Architecture of Perplexity Perplexity Labs is the most sophisticated AI service currently available, leveraging cutting-edge language models including GPT-4o and Claude 4.0 Sonnet, enabling deep analysis and generation of high-quality content. The platform conducts autonomous sessions of about 10 minutes or more, combining deep web browsing, code execution, graph creation, and multi-tool integration to transform ideas into complete deliverables.

Integrating this patrimonial documentation with Perplexity Labs‚Äô capabilities will create unprecedented synergies for historical and predictive analysis of the art market. This combination will reveal hidden patterns in the evolution of artistic tastes, valuations, and cultural trends over more than three centuries. This democratization is part of a broader trend in the evolution of the art market toward greater accessibility, illustrated by the 17% growth in sales by dealers with turnover below $250,000, and the increase in auction sales for works under $5,000. The Artprice-Perplexity alliance contributes to this trend by making technological excellence accessible to a broader audience of professionals and knowledgeable amateurs. Philosophical Dimension: A New Paradigm for AI in Art and Culture Redefining Intelligence in the Artistic Context The alliance between Artprice and Perplexity transcends purely economic and technological considerations and is part of a profound philosophical reflection on the nature of intelligence and its manifestation in the artistic and cultural domain. This philosophical dimension, emphasized by Thierry Ehrmann in his statement ‚ÄúThere can be no artificial intelligence without human intelligence,‚Äù sets a new paradigm of complementarity between human and artificial cognitive capacities. This philosophical approach opposes reductionist views of AI that see machines as substitutes for human intelligence, offering instead a symbiotic vision in which AI amplifies and enriches human capacities without replacing them. In the artistic context, this philosophy is especially significant because it recognizes that aesthetic understanding, cultural appreciation, and critical judgment remain fundamentally human, even when assisted by advanced technological tools. Epistemological Implications for Art Sciences Integrating AI into artistic research practices and art market analysis raises fundamental epistemological questions about the production and validation of knowledge in this field. The approach developed by Artprice and Perplexity‚Äîbased on systematic citation of official sources and information verifiability‚Äîestablishes new standards of scientific rigor for AI use in cultural research. This methodological shift deeply influences academic and professional practices, enabling researchers to access documentary bodies of unprecedented scale while adhering to traditional scientific rigor. The AI‚Äôs ability to process thousands of sources simultaneously and identify complex patterns opens new research possibilities unthinkable using traditional methods. Forward-looking Vision: Toward a Techno-ecology of the Sensitive The Artprice-Perplexity alliance fits within a forward-looking vision that goes beyond the simple instrumental use of technology to propose a true ‚Äútechno-ecology of the sensitive,‚Äù where digital tools become organic extensions of human sensibility and intelligence. This approach recognizes that aesthetic experience and cultural understanding cannot be reduced to computational processes, but can be enriched and deepened by appropriate intelligent systems. This philosophy of AI in art stands out from purely functionalist approaches by recognizing the existential and subjective dimension of artistic experience. It proposes a model of human-machine interaction where technology serves to reveal and explore the hidden dimensions of aesthetic experience rather than to replace or simplify it. Impact on the Educational and Professional Art Ecosystem Transformation of Pedagogical Practices in Artistic Education Artprice‚Äôs initiative to integrate AI training into its services is part of a broader transformation of pedagogical practices in artistic and cultural education. This shift, seen in many educational institutions, reflects the need to adapt training to the sector‚Äôs new technological realities. Training programs developed around the Artprice-Perplexity alliance contribute to the emergence of new professional profiles, such as ‚ÄúAI Artists,‚Äù ‚ÄúPrompt Designers,‚Äù or ‚ÄúGenerative AI Specialists,‚Äù responding to a growing demand in the job market for the creative industries. This professionalization of AI use in art creates new career opportunities while preserving the importance of traditional artistic training. Influence on Cultural and Museum Institutions The impact of the Artprice-Perplexity alliance extends beyond the commercial framework to influence practices in global cultural and museum institutions. Museums‚Äîan important part of Artprice‚Äôs clientele‚Äîbenefit from these technological innovations to improve their conservation, research, and cultural mediation practices. This influence is particularly evident in the development of new approaches to cultural mediation, where AI allows for the creation of personalized and interactive experiences for visitors. Institutions can use these technologies to develop adaptive visitor journeys, personalized recommendation systems, and in-depth analysis tools for their collections. Creation of an International Network of Technological Excellence The Artprice-Perplexity alliance contributes to the creation of an international network of technological excellence in the artistic and cultural sphere, connecting institutions, professionals, and researchers worldwide in innovative AI application practices. This network, bolstered by Artprice‚Äôs multilingual distribution in 119 countries and 11 languages, encourages the exchange of best practices and the collaborative development of new applications. This international dimension takes on particular importance in the current geopolitical context, as France seeks to position itself as the world‚Äôs third power in artificial intelligence after the US and China. The Artprice-Perplexity alliance, recognized and supported by French authorities, contributes to this ambition by showcasing French excellence in applying AI to the cultural and creative sectors. Future Perspectives and Strategic Developments Technological Roadmap 2025-2030 The collaboration between Artprice and Perplexity fits into a long-term strategic vision articulated around Artprice‚Äôs 2025-2030 plan, positioning the company as the global leader in AI-driven art market information. This roadmap foresees the progressive development of deeper integrations between Artprice‚Äôs proprietary technologies, including its Intuitive Artmarket¬Æ AI and its Blind Spot AI¬Æ technology, with Perplexity‚Äôs advanced capabilities. Future developments will likely focus on creating seamless integration between Artprice‚Äôs historical data and Perplexity‚Äôs real-time search capabilities, particularly via API connections or shared analysis platforms. The partnership could also explore joint development of AI tools specifically designed for art market analysis and prediction. Expansion into New Markets and Applications The success of this collaboration opens up prospects for expansion into other specialized knowledge domains, generally extending the influence of both companies beyond the traditional art market. The official recognition of La Demeure du Chaos/Abode of Chaos (dixit NYT) by Thierry Ehrmann‚Äîat the heart of Artprice‚Äôs headquarters‚Äîas a total work of art by the French Minister of Culture, Madame Rachida DATI, and its role in the national AI development strategy indicates potential government support for extending this collaboration model. Such cultural expansion could include developing similar applications in other sectors, such as architectural heritage, music, literature, or film, creating an integrated artificial cultural intelligence ecosystem. The methodological approach developed as part of the Artprice-Perplexity alliance could thus serve as a model for other sectors requiring the analysis of large amounts of cultural and historical data. Contribution to Global AI Innovation The Artprice-Perplexity alliance positions both companies to continue leading innovation in AI applications for the cultural and creative industries. Joint research and development efforts are producing new AI methodologies applicable beyond art market analysis, broadly contributing to the wider development of AI in cultural preservation and market intelligence.

The combined firm will be named Pubco and will trade under the ticker ‚ÄúPRTX,‚Äù an official release noted. SPAC Earmarks $31M for BTC Purchase The special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) deal will deliver up to $240 million to Parataxis Holdings, subject to shareholder redemptions. ‚ÄúThis includes $31 million of equity that will be funded immediately to purchase BTC,‚Äù the company said. Further, the deal values the combined company at $400 million, at a $10 share price. The share purchase agreement will give Pubco the flexibility to raise additional capital as needed to support the continued accumulation of BTC, it added. According to Parataxis CEO Edward Chin, the deal would make the new entity ‚Äúwell capitalised‚Äù to execute a BTC treasury strategy in the US. ‚ÄúWe will also be ideally positioned to further establish and grow our successful foothold in South Korea with Parataxis Korea,‚Äù Chin said.

However, at the beginning of the week, the leading Layer-1 protocol bounced back to reclaim $3,560. But whilst whales are buying ETH in droves, the smart money is looking elsewhere for serious gains‚Äîand the next ETH meme token earmarked by analysts for 150x gains has arrived in the form of Layer Brett ($LBRETT). Pundits believe that the Ethereum Layer 2 scalability solution memecoin is fully primed to outpace even Ethereum itself with staking rewards above 20,000% APY and explosive price potential. Learn why this low-cap blue chip gem in its crypto presale stage is seen in crypto circles as the next big thing. The Problem With Ethereum (And How $LBRETT Solves Them) Despite the recent uptick in Ethereum prices due to whale activity and on-chain ETF holdings surging to 40% in the past month‚Äînot to mention institutional giants like BlackRock also ramping up‚Äîits fundamental issues remain unsolved. Ethereum paved the way for smart contracts, but it hasn‚Äôt aged gracefully. High gas fees and slow confirmation times persist, requiring a legitimate Ethereum Layer 2 geared specifically to tackle these pain points head-on. Here‚Äôs why Layer Brett solves them: Ultra-low gas fees and lightning-fast transactions Anchored to Ethereum security but built for scale Seamless staking and buying via MetaMask or Trust Wallet Community-first model with no KYC requirements Layer Brett makes your Ethereum transactions run smoothly, bull or bear market notwithstanding, by processing transactions offchain and syncing securely back to the Ethereum mainnet. How $LBRETT Parlays Meme Power Into Real Utility Most meme tokens are just hype with no real features. That‚Äôs not the case here with Layer Brett . Beneath the viral-inducing packaging, Layer Brett offers massive utility. It‚Äôs a fully scalable, functional blockchain project with actual user benefits. Through its native dApp, users can stake $LBRETT in seconds, earning massive yields powered by low operating costs. Ethereum staking, by contrast, involves lockups, centralization risk, and far lower returns. Layer Brett offers strictly better rewards‚Äîadding fun to function altogether. Ethereum Dominated Early‚ÄîNow Layer Brett Offers a New Path Ethereum will always be a foundational piece of crypto infrastructure. But traders are increasingly diversifying into projects like Layer Brett that offer meme coin upside with actual blockchain substance. While Ethereum is valued in the hundreds of billions, $LBRETT is still under the radar. That means there‚Äôs more room for exponential growth. And with current Ethereum gas fees still reaching $10‚Äì$20 during congestion, it‚Äôs no surprise users are migrating to Ethereum Layer 2 solutions like Layer Brett. Why the Crypto Community Is Rallying Behind Layer Brett Unlike basic meme plays, Layer Brett fuses viral appeal with real infrastructure. It‚Äôs meme-born, utility-built. This project is already generating massive attention as one of the top diamonds in the rough in presale right now. With just 10 billion tokens, a transparent tokenomics model, and a $1 million giveaway, early buyers are perfectly positioned for huge upside. Add in NFT integration, gamified staking, and future cross-chain interoperability, and it‚Äôs clear Layer Brett is built to scale. Ethereum Walked So Layer Brett Can Run Ethereum led the revolution‚Äîbut now, Layer Brett is pushing it further. With the speed of Layer 2, the power of community, and the potential for 150x gains, this is the best crypto to invest in before the next crypto bull run in 2025 kicks off. Buy, stake, and meme your way into the future. Don‚Äôt let this Layer 2 rocket take off without you. Layer Brett is available in presale‚Äîbut don‚Äôt wait too late. This is YOUR opportunity to get in early on the most scalable meme project to ever launch on Ethereum.",Press Release,EN,0,0,ETH|ZRX|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-07 04:21:05

Curve‚Äôs deployment on Etherelink gives the Tezos ecosystem access to deep stablecoin liquidity and efficient pegged asset trading. The firm is also participating in Apple Farm Season 2 rewards program to encourage active use of DeFi apps on Etherlink. Curve has deployed on the Tezos Layer 2 blockchain, Etherlink. The decentralized exchange platforms will offer deep liquidity and low slippage in trading stablecoins, pegged assets, and cross-currency pairs. Etherlink is designed as a Tezos-native Smart Rollup, unlike most EVM L2s, which rely on separate governance and upgrade mechanisms. The firm said the L2 blockchain benefits from Tezos‚Äô on-chain governance, low fees, and fast decision-making. Curve seeks to bridge Tezos and EVM ecosystems @CurveFinance ‚Äì the go-to DEX for efficient, low-slippage trading of stablecoins, pegged assets, and cross-currency pairs. ‚Äî Etherlink üîó (@etherlink) August 6, 2025 Curve believes the deep protocol integration will position it as the major liquidity engine bridging the Tezos and EVM ecosystems. Maximilian Roszko, who leads network expansion at Curve, said a Curve deployment on Etherelink gives the Tezos ecosystem access to deep stablecoin liquidity and efficient pegged asset trading. He acknowledged that it was what made the initiative strategically interesting for the company. Curve said it will be among the platforms participating in Apple Farm Season 2 as part of its mission to support its growth. The initiative is a rewards program designed to boost the use of DeFi apps on Etherlink. Apple Farm launched on Etherlink and has over $3 million in rewards to drive further adoption across the Layer 2 DeFi ecosystem. Curve said the launch makes it the stablecoin and pegged asset backbone for both Etherlink and Tezos. It aims to bring liquidity to the integrated rollup and L1 pairing. The firm sees the initiative as a step towards better stablecoin infrastructure across the L2 network. ‚ÄúHaving Curve as our stablecoin backbone changes everything for Etherlink users. Traders can now access the deep liquidity they‚Äôre used to on mainnet, but with the speed and cost benefits of our Tezos-native rollup architecture.‚Äù -David Relkin, Head of DeFi and Nomadic Labs. Curve‚Äôs founder, Michael Egorov, believes the firm is poised for growth this year. He believes it will be driven by new exchanges for stablecoins pegged to different fiat currencies. He also believes that blockchain developers will cause the number of DEX and CEX stablecoin offerings to increase through the creation of new alternatives. Etherlink sees increased ecosystem deployment Etherlink has also seen strong ecosystem momentum, receiving several developments across its ecosystem in recent months. Midas launched two new tokens, mBASIS and mTBILL, on the Layer 2 blockchain last month. The company said the partnership resulted in increased activity on Etherlink with enhanced staking and liquidity channels for DeFi protocols. The Etherlink team championed the initiative with a $3 million incentive for developers. The Etherlink team said the firm‚Äôs recent launch of platforms like uranium.io and Superland partnership helps it create a robust foundation for sustained ecosystem growth. They added that the continued ecosystem announcements will stimulate growth within Tezos L2 and potentially alter DeFi tokenization landscapes with efficient, compliant solutions. The blockchain‚Äôs network performance also surged as season 1 attracted thousands of users. Its performance peaked at $47.7M in TVL and $88.5M in on-chain asset value. Its smart contract storage speed is also improving up to 30x, and bridging times are reduced from 15 days to under a minute.",Industry Thoughts,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|TOKEN SALE|ZRX|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-07 04:24:51

A fascinating trend has emerged, indicating a significant shift in market dynamics. Are we witnessing a period of crucial stability for the leading digital asset? This analysis delves into the latest Bitcoin holder behavior , offering essential perspectives on the current market. Understanding Bitcoin Short-Term Holders: A Key Market Indicator Recent data suggests a notable change in the behavior of Bitcoin short-term holders . These are individuals who have held their BTC for less than 155 days. Historically, this group is more prone to selling, especially when prices fluctuate. However, the current scenario paints a different picture, according to Cointelegraph, citing Glassnode. These holders have significantly reduced their profit-taking activities. The proportion of spent volume from holders in profit has dropped to just 45%. This is a crucial metric, as it shows less immediate desire to sell for gains. Furthermore, approximately 70% of their total holdings remain profitable. This indicates a strong underlying value perception among these newer market participants. This easing of selling pressure from Bitcoin short-term holders is a positive sign. It suggests a growing confidence in Bitcoin‚Äôs current valuation, even amidst broader market uncertainties. It reflects a maturing market where immediate profit-taking isn‚Äôt the sole driver for these specific participants, indicating a shift in overall Bitcoin holder behavior . Navigating Bitcoin Price Consolidation: What Does It Mean? Bitcoin‚Äôs price has been consolidating around the $114,800 mark. This period of Bitcoin price consolidation is often characterized by a lack of strong directional movement. Instead, the price tends to trade within a relatively narrow range. For investors, consolidation periods can be both challenging and opportune: Challenges: Lack of clear trends can make short-term trading difficult. Opportunities: It can represent a period of accumulation for long-term investors. It also allows the market to digest previous price movements before a potential breakout. The fact that Bitcoin short-term holders are easing their selling during this phase provides valuable insight. It implies that many are content to hold, rather than liquidate, even without significant upward momentum. This behavior contributes directly to the stability observed in the current BTC market balance , showcasing a more resilient Bitcoin holder behavior . Achieving BTC Market Balance: Insights from Holder Behavior The concept of BTC market balance refers to a state where buying and selling pressures are relatively equal. When the market is balanced, it tends to exhibit lower volatility and more predictable movements. The data from Glassnode strongly supports this notion. When 70% of short-term holder holdings remain profitable, yet only 45% of spent volume comes from profitable coins, it signals a healthy equilibrium. Holders are not rushing to sell their profitable coins, indicating they anticipate further gains or are simply comfortable with their current positions. This cautious approach helps to prevent drastic price swings. This balanced state is vital for sustainable growth in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. It builds a foundation of confidence and reduces the likelihood of sharp corrections driven by impulsive selling from newer participants. Understanding this aspect of Bitcoin holder behavior is key to long-term market assessment. Future Outlook: What This Crypto Market Analysis Suggests This detailed crypto market analysis paints an optimistic picture for Bitcoin‚Äôs near-term trajectory. The reduced selling from Bitcoin short-term holders during a period of price consolidation suggests underlying strength. This careful Bitcoin holder behavior is key to understanding the market‚Äôs next moves. What could this mean for the future? Increased Stability: Less erratic behavior from a historically volatile group contributes to overall market calm. Potential for Upside: If short-term holders are not selling, it means more supply is being held, which can pave the way for upward price movements once demand increases. Maturing Market: This trend indicates a growing maturity within the Bitcoin market, where participants are becoming more strategic rather than reactive. While past performance does not guarantee future results, the current data provides a compelling narrative of a market finding its footing. The collective patience of Bitcoin short-term holders is a testament to Bitcoin‚Äôs enduring appeal and its potential for continued growth. This particular aspect of Bitcoin holder behavior is a strong indicator of market health. Conclusion: A Foundation of Patience for Bitcoin The recent actions of Bitcoin short-term holders are a powerful indicator of a stabilizing market. Their reduced selling pressure amid Bitcoin price consolidation is fostering a healthier BTC market balance . This crucial development, highlighted by recent crypto market analysis and positive Bitcoin holder behavior , suggests a foundational shift towards more patient and strategic holding. As the market continues to evolve, understanding the nuances of holder behavior will remain paramount for all participants. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What defines Bitcoin short-term holders? A1: Bitcoin short-term holders are typically defined as entities or individuals who have held their Bitcoin for less than 155 days. They often react more quickly to price movements compared to long-term holders. Q2: What does it mean when Bitcoin is in a period of price consolidation? A2: Bitcoin price consolidation occurs when the price trades within a relatively narrow range after a significant move. It indicates a period of indecision or equilibrium between buyers and sellers, often preceding a new trend. Q3: How does reduced selling by short-term holders impact Bitcoin‚Äôs price? A3: When Bitcoin short-term holders reduce their selling, it indicates they are less inclined to take profits or cut losses. This reduces selling pressure on the market, contributing to price stability and potentially setting the stage for future upward movement if demand increases. Q4: What is the significance of BTC market balance? A4: BTC market balance signifies a state where buying and selling forces are relatively equal, leading to lower volatility. This balance creates a more stable and predictable environment, which can build investor confidence and support sustainable growth. Q5: Does this analysis suggest a good time to buy Bitcoin? A5: While this analysis highlights a period of stability and reduced selling pressure from Bitcoin short-term holders , investment decisions should always be based on individual financial goals and thorough research. Market stability can be seen as an opportune time for some, but it does not guarantee future price increases. If you found this analysis insightful, share it with your network!

The price formed a short-term top and started a fresh decline below the $3.020 level. The price dipped below the $3.00 level. There was a move below $2.950 and the price tested the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.730 swing low to the $3.106 high. However, the bulls were active near the $2.920 zone. The price is now trading near $2.980 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $3.00 level. There is also a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3.020 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The first major resistance is near the $3.10 level. A clear move above the $3.10 resistance might send the price toward the $3.120 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $3.180 resistance or even $3.20 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near the $3.250 zone. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $3.020 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.920 level. The next major support is near the $2.880 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.730 swing low to the $3.106 high. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.880 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.810 support.

Dogecoin is once again nearing the $1 target mark as the whole crypto market rebounds. Several traders recall the last time DOGE approached this level and are keenly observing a repeat of such. But while the spotlight shines on DOGE, there‚Äôs movement in other corners of the market too‚Äîespecially around XRP, PEPE, and a surprising new entry, MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP Gains Momentum with ETF Buzz XRP has rallied over the last few days amid speculation that the ETF might be approved. The coin surged above $3.0, increasing by nearly 33 percent over a single month. According to some analysts, this may be the beginning of something bigger. XRP may also breach the $4 mark this year, especially when regulators provide clear guidelines or when an ETF is launched. The investor confidence is gaining presently, and the trading volume proves it. XRP is also benefiting from the overall market sentiment. Bitcoin‚Äôs stability and renewed interest in altcoins are helping push XRP higher. With more institutions eyeing XRP, the coin‚Äôs fundamentals and network strength are also receiving fresh attention. PEPE Comes Roaring Back PEPE has recovered in the crypto market after consolidating for some weeks The memecoin is trading at $0.00001048 today. The memecoin has benefitted from the overall market recovery and social media hype. For many, PEPE‚Äôs recovery signals that the meme coin market isn‚Äôt just alive‚Äîit‚Äôs gearing up for a new run. Investors are now hunting for the next coin with viral potential and are hoping to catch the wave early. Some Traders Bet on MAGACOIN FINANCE Instead While Dogecoin‚Äôs path to $1 continues to build excitement, a newer coin is turning heads‚ÄîMAGACOIN FINANCE. The project is generating hype due to its branding technique and meme-based approach. According to analysts, MAGACOIN has the potential to provide a massive 18,700% ROI before the current bull market reaches full swing. MAGACOIN FINANCE provides deflationary tokenomics, staking abilities, and long-term development plans. The qualities provide it with an advantage over most other memecoins in the market that only survive on community hype. As its presale gains momentum, early buyers believe they‚Äôve found the next breakout star. MAGACOIN is showing all the early signs of a coin preparing to explode once it launches on exchanges. Final Thoughts With DOGE approaching $1 and coins like XRP and PEPE moving fast, meme coin traders are wide awake. But many believe the biggest profits come from getting in early‚Äîand MAGACOIN FINANCE is currently front and center. As long as the hype is real and the roadmap delivers, this underdog might beat its competitors before they even make it to the starting line.

Bloomberg reported Wednesday that Kennedy, who is based in Edinburgh, will oversee Kinexys Digital Assets and Kinexys Labs, two units that focus on asset tokenization and blockchain project development, respectively. She will lead the division alongside Naveen Mallela, who remains in Singapore and will continue to manage the payments side, including Kinexys Digital Payments and Kinexys Liink. JPMorgan Chase has appointed a new global co-head of its blockchain division https://t.co/tvzYdx28uj ‚Äî Bloomberg (@business) August 6, 2025 Before stepping into her new role, Kennedy led digital asset product strategy for JPMorgan‚Äôs securities services business. She brings a background in navigating institutional blockchain adoption and will now take the reins at a time when the bank is expanding its pilot programs in tokenized finance. JPMorgan Expands Blockchain Pilots With JPMD Token and Carbon Credit Platform JPMorgan has been trialling JPMD , a blockchain-based token that represents dollar deposits. In June, it completed its first transfer of JPMD from the bank‚Äôs digital wallet to crypto exchange Coinbase. Since then, the pilot has been ongoing and is expected to continue for several more months. It may then expand to other users and potentially include more currencies, depending on regulatory approval. Last month, Kinexys helped test a new blockchain platform for carbon credits . The pilot involved S&P Global Commodity Insights, EcoRegistry and the International Carbon Registry. Together, they aim to tokenize carbon credits listed in each registry‚Äôs system. This would create a more transparent and traceable market for climate-related assets. Recent US Stablecoin Rules Fuel Institutional Blockchain Momentum Kennedy‚Äôs appointment comes at a time when blockchain adoption is gaining momentum among multinational banks. This shift is being driven by new legislation in the US that sets a legal framework for stablecoins and tokenized deposits. As a result, institutions that once moved cautiously are now accelerating pilot programs. They are also bringing in experienced leaders to guide their efforts. The Kinexys division was carved out of JPMorgan‚Äôs broader Onyx platform. It was then rebranded to better match the bank‚Äôs commercial goals. Now, it unifies tokenization, digital payments and information networks under a single structure. This setup is designed to serve corporates and institutions adopting blockchain-based systems. Industry observers say JPMorgan‚Äôs proactive approach is a clear signal. Large financial institutions are preparing for a future where assets, transactions and data flows exist directly on-chain. Already, tokenized payments, cross-border settlements and carbon credit tracking offer early signs of how these systems might develop.

The ‚ÄòCL‚Äô is an innovative infrastructure protocol based on the Kaia chain that enables simultaneous participation in validator staking and liquidity provision. By integrating Kaia‚Äôs CL technology into the BORA ecosystem, METABORA GAMES will begin full-scale connectivity with external chains through the establishment of a joint liquidity pool, the introduction of a ‚Äògas abstraction‚Äô model (which enables transaction fees to be paid on behalf of users), and the implementation of a fee-burning mechanism. With the completion of the CL integration, METABORA GAMES and the Kaia Foundation established a joint liquidity provision plan and provided approximately $2 million in liquidity as of August 5. The partners plan to further boost the BORA ecosystem and enhance the token‚Äôs value through additional phased liquidity injections. Additionally, a burn mechanism will be applied to the fee revenue generated from the joint liquidity pool. A certain portion of BORA-denominated profits will be burned, reinforcing the ecosystem‚Äôs deflationary tokenomics. The burn rate and frequency will be adjusted flexibly in accordance with market conditions and revenue scale. The integration will also introduce a ‚Äògas abstraction‚Äô feature, allowing users to pay transaction fees on the Kaia mainnet using BORA tokens. This enables users to cover transaction fees with BORA tokens even if they do not hold any Kaia tokens. A METABORA GAMES representative stated, ‚ÄúThe integration of the CL Protocol marks the first step for the BORA chain in achieving functional flexibility and scalability by structurally connecting with external public infrastructure. This signifies a transition and expansion from an independent BORA mainnet model to an interactive structure that engages with external ecosystems.‚Äù They added, ‚ÄúStarting with the launch of mini Dapps based on LINE Messenger and onboarding on Kaia, we will further strengthen BORA‚Äôs tokenomics by expanding external utility and operating an organic burn mechanism that functions seamlessly across multiple chains.‚Äù About METABORA METABORA is a casual game developer and the service operator of the blockchain platform BORA. The BORA ecosystem brings together partners across various industries‚Äîranging from tokenomics and content to blockchain technology‚Äîdriving innovation and collaboration across games, sports, and entertainment. BORA is a national game/entertainment token with a high liquidity in the market and reinforcing the accessibility of users and services abroad by increasing the listing on global cryptocurrency exchanges and expanding partnership.

Realized Cap Shows Divergence Between Ethereum & Bitcoin In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has discussed about how the Realized Cap has changed for some of the assets in the cryptocurrency sector. The ‚Äú Realized Cap ‚Äù refers to a capitalization model that calculates a given coin‚Äôs total value by assuming the ‚Äòtrue‚Äô value of each token in circulation is the spot price at which it was last involved in a transaction. In short, what this indicator represents is the total amount of capital that the investors of the cryptocurrency as a whole have stored into it. Changes in its value, therefore, correspond to the inflow or outflow of capital. Below is the chart shared by Glassnode that shows the 30-day percentage change in the Realized Cap for a few different digital assets. From the graph, it‚Äôs visible that the monthly change in the Realized Cap is currently positive for all four of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and the top memecoins. This suggests that capital has flowed into the market over the last 30 days. Though, while this is true, BTC and SOL have been showing a shift in the short term. One week ago, the Realized Cap change for them stood at 6.66% and 6.34%, respectively. But today, the metric‚Äôs value has come down to 5.46% and 4.84%. Still notably positive, of course, but does reflect a slowdown in demand. Interestingly, while these two tokens have witnessed this trend, ETH has continued its Realized Cap growth with the percentage change jumping from 5.32% to 6.41%. This may be an indication that capital is rotating from other assets into the token number two by market cap . The top meme-based tokens have seen a flat trend in the indicator during the past week, which, according to the analytics firm, is another sign of ‚Äúcooling risk appetite.‚Äù In some other news, both the largest and smallest of investors on the Bitcoin network have been accumulating at the same time recently, as Glassnode has pointed out in another X post . In the chart, the data of the ‚Äú Accumulation Trend Score ‚Äù is shown, which tells us about whether Bitcoin investors are accumulating or distributing. A value close to 1 implies dominant buying, while a value near 0 suggests selling pressure. As is apparent from the graph, the metric‚Äôs value has been pretty close to 1 for both below 1 BTC and above 10,000 BTC investors. ‚ÄúThis suggests initial dip-buying during the recent correction,‚Äù notes the analytics firm. That said, Glassnode also cautions that the signal is lagging, with investor behavior smoothed over a 15-day window. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $115,100, down over 2% in the last seven days.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Realized Cap|btc|BTCUSDT|ETH|Ethereum|Ethereum Realized Cap|SOL|solana,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|SOL|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-07 05:00:20

While Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate headlines, other tokens are offering huge opportunities with fresh incentives, corporate backing, or major network upgrades. These aren‚Äôt speculative shots in the dark; they‚Äôre projects with real traction and plans that are getting investors‚Äô attention. In a market as competitive as this, knowing which assets have upside potential can make a big difference. So let‚Äôs break it down. Here‚Äôs a closer look at four cryptos, BlockDAG, BNB, Solana, and Dogecoin, that deserve your attention in 2025. Each of them brings something different to the table, but all of them are shaping up as serious contenders for anyone building a forward-thinking crypto portfolio this year. 1. BlockDAG: The Presale You Can‚Äôt Ignore If you‚Äôre looking for the best crypto to buy with real upside, BlockDAG is leading the conversation. This presale has already raised around $363 million and sold over 24.6 billion BDAG tokens. For now, the price is still at $0.0016 until August 11, 2025, after which it will reset to about $0.0276, with a final launch price set at $0.05. For early investors, this means a potential 3,025% ROI, making this one of the most attractive entry points in the current market. But the numbers aren‚Äôt the only thing driving interest. BlockDAG has introduced Dashboard V4, turning the presale into a live trading simulation. Buyers can access real-time BDAG/USD charts, live order books, and wallet balance updates, all while still in the presale phase. It‚Äôs designed to give both new and experienced traders a hands-on experience that feels like using a real exchange. To sweeten the deal, BlockDAG has launched a 10 BTC auction running until August 11, with a prize pool worth around $1.1 million. All presale participants automatically enter, and rewards are distributed proportionally based on purchase size. This combination of low entry price, interactive features, and direct incentives makes BlockDAG stand out. For those looking for a token with big potential and strong presale energy, this is arguably the best crypto to buy right now. 2. BNB: Corporate Money and Steady Growth BNB has proven it can hold its ground as a top-tier crypto. Currently priced at around $748.87, it recently weathered a market correction and maintained its position above key support levels. What‚Äôs pushing BNB higher is a surge in corporate treasury acquisitions. Big names like Nano Labs and CEA Industries are scooping up huge amounts of BNB, with plans to deploy billions into BNB-based funds. At the same time, Binance continues to expand its offerings. The launch of a web version of Binance Wallet and extended access to BTC options trading add more utility to the ecosystem, making BNB more than just an exchange token. Analysts are projecting steady gains, with near-term targets of $814 and a bullish outlook that sees the potential for $1,290 if momentum builds. For investors who want a large-cap asset with corporate confidence and platform-driven growth, BNB is still one of the best cryptos to buy in 2025. 3. Solana: Upgrades and Institutional Support Solana, trading at about $161.94, is holding support in the $155‚Äì$160 zone, with key resistance sitting around $171‚Äì$174. If it breaks past that range, a move toward $175‚Äì$190 seems likely in the short term. Institutions are taking notice, too. Bit Mining recently invested around $5 million into Solana and launched its own validator node. Meanwhile, DevvStream Holdings has committed $10 million into Bitcoin and Solana to support its blockchain-based carbon credit initiatives. On the technical side, a significant protocol upgrade with Phylax aims to boost DeFi liquidity and improve network performance, driving growth in Solana‚Äôs ecosystem. Analysts are optimistic about its trajectory, forecasting that Solana could reach the $200‚Äì$300 range by year‚Äôs end, with some predicting a possible climb toward $400 in the next bullish cycle. With strong development activity and institutional backing, Solana is another strong candidate for those considering the best crypto to buy this year. 4. Dogecoin: Still Holding Strong Dogecoin may not have the same buzz it had during its early rallies, but it‚Äôs far from quiet. Priced at about $0.1986, it‚Äôs down roughly 30% from its July highs of $0.28, but large holders are treating this as a buying opportunity. Over 310 million DOGE have been accumulated by institutional wallets during the recent dip, showing that the smart money hasn‚Äôt abandoned it. Futures open interest has also climbed above $3 billion, pointing to growing speculative activity and positioning DOGE for a potential breakout. If it can clear $0.24, the next targets could range between $0.28‚Äì$0.30. Longer-term projections are even more bullish, with some analysts predicting it could reach $1.40 by the end of 2025 under the right market conditions. For those comfortable with volatility and looking for an affordable entry point, Dogecoin still has room to surprise and remains one of the best cryptos to buy in 2025. Summing Up Choosing the best crypto to buy in 2025 means balancing opportunity with strategy. BlockDAG is offering one of the most compelling presales in years, with interactive tools, a Bitcoin reward pool, and a massive ROI potential for early buyers. BNB shows that corporate interest and continued platform growth can keep a large-cap token relevant and promising. Solana‚Äôs network upgrades and institutional backing make it a strong contender for long-term growth, while Dogecoin remains a wildcard with loyal backing and potential for big moves. Whether you‚Äôre seeking a presale with explosive potential or a token with institutional confidence, these four cryptos deserve a spot on your watchlist.

A bonus that supports everyday betting can turn marginal weeks into winning ones. Whether placing bets on football, basketball, or live events, daily bonuses add that extra edge. But many sportsbooks fall short on delivering real daily incentives. This comparison looks at Spartans , Betway, and Betfair to see which platform gives the best daily sports betting bonus in 2025. The focus is on fairness, consistency, and how well each reward suits a daily routine. Spartans Offers a 25% Daily Bonus With Clear Terms and Real Flexibility Spartans offer the only true daily sports bonus among the three. Users can claim a 25% bonus every day on deposits starting from just $10. The bonus works across all sports with only a 1.80 minimum odds condition per selection. A wagering requirement of 8x applies, keeping things clear and manageable for frequent bettors. What makes Spartans stand out is its predictable setup. Bettors know what to expect, no surprise clauses or shifting terms. The bonus can be claimed once a day, and users have three full days to meet the wagering requirement. That extended window gives bettors room to think, plan, and place bets naturally rather than rushing. Spartans also supports fast crypto transactions, allowing global users to fund and withdraw with ease. But beyond convenience, the bonus fits perfectly into the rhythm of daily play. It rewards consistency, gives players full control, and works smoothly with how seasoned users bet each day. Betway‚Äôs Weekly Specials Don‚Äôt Support Daily Betting Habits Betway is known for a wide sportsbook and an easy-to-navigate platform. Yet when it comes to daily rewards, it falls short. Most of its promotions are tied to weekly or seasonal events. Bettors might find odds boosts or combo bet perks, but daily deposit bonuses are not part of the core system. For users who bet every morning, the absence of a regular daily reward can feel limiting. While Betway does roll out decent offers from time to time, they‚Äôre typically campaign-specific and often hidden behind promotion tabs, making them hard to plan around. The lack of routine bonuses makes Betway less suitable for those who value structure in their betting habits. In contrast to Spartans‚Äô reliable approach, Betway seems to focus more on occasional engagement rather than day-to-day support. For daily bettors seeking steady returns, it doesn‚Äôt offer the consistency needed. Betfair‚Äôs Cashback Model Doesn‚Äôt Help Consistent Winners Betfair is a big name in the sportsbook space, best known for its exchange model. When it comes to bonuses, Betfair promotes cashback offers based on losses over certain periods. While this might help newer users or cautious players, it doesn‚Äôt appeal to those who play daily with a win-first mindset. Cashback offers are designed for damage control. They only activate after losses, meaning consistent winners get little or nothing. There‚Äôs no upfront reward for betting daily, and the system doesn‚Äôt incentivize strong, ongoing play. Betfair‚Äôs model lacks the proactive reward structure that daily bettors want. Those who deposit and wager regularly won‚Äôt find any benefit tied to their frequency. When measured against Spartans‚Äô direct and repeatable daily bonus, Betfair‚Äôs cashback scheme simply can‚Äôt compete. It‚Äôs a fallback plan, not a real reward. Spartans Offers the Best Daily Bonus in 2025 Daily sports bettors want a reward system that fits their pace. Spartans deliver exactly that. The 25% bonus is available every day, has fair terms, low deposit requirements, and a practical three-day usage limit. It‚Äôs designed for strategic bettors who don‚Äôt want to be rushed or restricted. Betway has its strengths, but its reliance on weekly promotions means it doesn‚Äôt cater well to everyday users. Betfair‚Äôs cashback model provides some support, but only after losses, offering little value to regular, winning bettors. In 2025, Spartans stands out as the best choice for those looking to boost their daily betting returns with a reliable and easy-to-use bonus.

MUTM is launching with real, on-chain financial tools that will drive sustainable usage from day one. For those who missed out on BNB early, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up to be the next big thing‚Äîexcept it‚Äôs entering the market with much more than an exchange discount. Built-in utility that pays you to participate Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will redefine decentralized lending by combining traditional DeFi structures with advanced tools for passive income and capital efficiency. Its Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model will enable users to earn a consistent yield by depositing blue-chip cryptocurrencies into smart contract-governed liquidity pools. For example, a user who deposits $20,000 worth of MATIC will earn a 10% APY, resulting in $2,000 per year in hands-off passive income. These returns won‚Äôt rely on hype‚Äîthey‚Äôll be driven by actual pool utilization, dynamically adjusting based on borrower demand. After depositing, users will receive mtTokens‚ÄîERC-20 interest-bearing tokens that represent their share of the pool. These tokens will appreciate in value over time as interest accrues and can also be used as collateral to unlock stablecoin liquidity. This dual-purpose design means users won‚Äôt have to choose between earning yield and accessing capital‚Äîthey‚Äôll be able to do both simultaneously, unlocking a new layer of capital efficiency. Beyond pooled lending, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will introduce a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) marketplace, built for risk-tolerant users seeking higher yields or customized terms. Instead of relying on shared pools, individuals will be able to negotiate directly, setting interest rates, durations, and collateral types. This model will be ideal for leveraging lower-cap or speculative assets that fall outside typical DeFi frameworks. For instance, a user could post $2,200 in FLOKI as collateral and borrow $1,500 in USDC, with the agreement automatically enforced through a self-executing smart contract. To safeguard all participants, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs smart contract system will enforce mandatory overcollateralization, monitor collateral health via a built-in Stability Factor, and trigger automatic liquidation if conditions deteriorate. This ensures that even high-risk loans remain contained within predictable, on-chain rules, minimizing systemic risk while maximizing opportunity. Presale acceleration, institutional-grade security, and a 22.8x price outlook Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 6 of its presale, with tokens priced at $0.035. The phase is already 10% sold, and once it reaches full capacity, the price will rise by 15% to $0.040. With a target listing price of $0.06 and an anticipated post-launch projection of $0.80 based on platform utility, growing user base, and exchange exposure, the upside is massive‚Äîmore than 22x from today‚Äôs price. Investors who entered back in Phase 1 at $0.01 have already multiplied their positions by 250%, and there is still room to grow. The platform‚Äôs security is already a standout, with a thorough CertiK audit confirming its smart contract integrity. The Token Scan Score currently stands at 95.00, backed by a CertiK Skynet Score of 78.00. To further reinforce safety, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched a $50,000 bug bounty program with critical bug reports earning up to $2,000 in rewards, ensuring the system is battle-tested before its public rollout. Community strength continues to grow with over 12,000 followers on Twitter and an active $100,000 giveaway campaign where ten early adopters will each win $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. These promotional efforts are rewarding early believers while adding more visibility to the presale. Looking forward, as the beta launch of the platform approaches, interaction rates are expected to surge. Listings on leading exchanges such as Binance, MEXC, KuCoin, or Coinbase will bring even more eyes and users into the ecosystem, helping drive demand and price momentum. With a limited total supply of 4 billion tokens and real DeFi functionality at its core, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just another altcoin‚Äîit is a capital engine in motion. BNB started as a simple discount token for traders. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is beginning its journey as a revenue-generating platform for the entire crypto economy. At just $0.035, it offers more utility, stronger tokenomics, and a clearer path to adoption than BNB had at the same price level.

SOL price is now consolidating gains and might aim for more gains above the $172 zone. SOL price started a fresh upward move above the $165 and $166 levels against the US Dollar. The price is now trading above $165 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a contracting triangle forming with resistance at $168 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $172 resistance zone. Solana Price Eyes Upside Break Solana price started a decent increase after it found support near the $162 zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . SOL climbed above the $165 level to enter a short-term positive zone. The price even smashed the $1682 resistance. The bulls were able to push the price above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $172 swing high to the $162 low. However, the bears are active near the $170 zone. The 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $172 swing high to the $162 low is acting as a resistance. There is also a contracting triangle forming with resistance at $168 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. Solana is now trading above $165 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $170 level. The next major resistance is near the $172 level. The main resistance could be $175. A successful close above the $175 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $182. Any more gains might send the price toward the $192 level. Are Downsides Limited In SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $170 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $164 zone. The first major support is near the $162 level. A break below the $162 level might send the price toward the $152 support zone. If there is a close below the $150 support, the price could decline toward the $145 support in the near term.

BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) led with $426.22 million, while Fidelity‚Äôs FETH added $35.01 million. Total ETH ETF assets now exceed $10 billion, about 4% of Ethereum‚Äôs market cap. ETH‚Äôs price rose 10% to ~$3,871, driven by institutional demand and whale accumulation, including a $114 million buy by wallet 0xF436. Technical indicators show ETH testing $4,000 resistance, with support at $3,824. Despite $2.2 billion in staking withdrawals, optimism around the Pectra upgrade and regulatory clarity fuels sentiment. However, a bearish MACD and profit-taking risks could cap gains. A breakout above $4,100 may target $4,500. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for institutional and retail growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs strength will lie in its versatile dual lending model, crafted to serve diverse user needs within the crypto lending space. On one hand, its Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pools will enable investors to deposit stablecoins and blue-chip tokens such as USDC, ETH, or AVAX, earning steady APY yields while receiving mtTokens that will represent their share and accumulate staking rewards (in MUTM) if staked in the smart contracts. This system will be attractive to institutional players seeking reliable returns with transparent risk profiles. On the other hand, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will open doors to a speculative frontier through its Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending, allowing high-risk memecoins like PEPE, TRUMP, and DOGE to be used as collateral. This segment will empower users to negotiate customized loan terms with higher interest rates, creating an inclusive financial rail that will accommodate a broad spectrum of risk appetites without mixing risk pools. This segregation will reduce systemic risk and enhance user confidence, making MUTM an appealing token for both conservative and aggressive investors. Currently in its Phase 6 presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens are offered at $0.035, with 10% of the total supply sold to over 14,800 holders, and $14.1 million raised. Early Phase 1 investors are enjoying 3.5x paper gains as the price prepares to jump to the upcoming listing price of $0.06. The platform‚Äôs beta launch is set to coincide with this listing, bringing to market full user functionality and anticipated liquidity boosts. This upcoming beta will activate core lending, borrowing, and staking features on Layer-2 networks, delivering the speed and low fees that institutional and retail users demand. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs roadmap points to significant milestones in decentralized stablecoin issuance, where stablecoins are minted only during collateral-backed loans and burned upon repayment. This mechanism will generate continuous on-chain volume, creating a powerful feedback loop of utility that supports long-term token demand. Roadmap and security foundations support a $2 target with realistic growth drivers Security remains a top priority for Mutuum Finance (MUTM), reflected in its CertiK audit, which awarded the project an impressive score of 95, alongside a Skynet rating of 78. This rigorous third-party verification gives investors confidence that the protocol‚Äôs smart contracts and Layer-2 integrations maintain high standards for safety and resilience. Looking at the broader market, Layer-2 projects with similar technical and functional profiles have demonstrated exponential growth, often realizing 10x to 20x returns post-launch once utility and liquidity mature. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs structured four-phase roadmap‚Äîfrom ongoing smart contract development and audit to launch, exchange listings, and liquidity mining‚Äîmirrors these success trajectories. Beyond the upcoming beta, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is targeting listings on respected exchanges such as Kraken and KuCoin, which will significantly increase token accessibility and trading volume. These listings, combined with growing community momentum including over 12,000 Twitter followers and a $100,000 MUTM token giveaway , set the stage for a rapid adoption cycle. Final words Investors should note that MUTM‚Äôs growth is driven by tangible developments, not hype. The token‚Äôs utility will deepen as more users participate in both P2C and P2P lending, staking rewards, and stablecoin minting. This creates real demand fueled by active usage rather than speculative pumps. Given the solid foundation and layered roadmap progress, analysts projecting a $2 target for MUTM by mid-2026 base their outlook on achievable milestones and real-world adoption, indicating a trajectory that outpaces ETH price appreciation in the same timeframe. With Ethereum (ETH)‚Äôs institutional inflows laying a fertile ground, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a compelling opportunity for investors seeking next-level exposure to DeFi innovation. As the presale nears its next phase with a planned price increase to $0.040, the window to secure tokens at the discounted $0.035 price is closing fast. This strategic entry point, combined with Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs robust platform features and forthcoming liquidity events, makes MUTM one of the most promising under-$0.05 tokens to watch in 2025 and beyond.

He suggests that GameStop (GME), once the poster child of meme stock frenzy, now surprisingly mirrors Bitcoin (BTC) as its volatility dramatically declines. This intriguing insight into GameStop Bitcoin volatility challenges previous perceptions and signals a potential new chapter for the retail trading favorite. What‚Äôs Driving This GME Bitcoin Comparison? Bill Gross, co-founder of investment management firm PIMCO, shared his unique perspective in an interview with Business Insider. He noted that GameStop‚Äôs price action over the past year has become remarkably stable, trading consistently between $20 and $35. This steady pattern stands in stark contrast to its explosive 2021 surge, which saw GME skyrocket from under $1 in 2020 to $121 in January 2021. Declining Volatility: GME‚Äôs price swings are now significantly reduced. Stable Trading Range: A consistent $20-$35 band for over a year. Mirroring Bitcoin: This new stability echoes Bitcoin‚Äôs own price movements, particularly its consolidation phases. Gross emphasizes that this behavior makes GME resemble Bitcoin more than a typical meme stock. The wild, unpredictable swings that defined its meme status have largely subsided, indicating a potential maturity in its market dynamics. This fascinating GME Bitcoin comparison highlights a significant shift. The Remarkable Decline in GameStop Bitcoin Volatility The transformation of GameStop from a highly volatile, unpredictable asset to one showing surprising stability is indeed remarkable. For many investors, the idea of comparing GameStop to Bitcoin, a leading cryptocurrency, might seem unusual. However, Bill Gross Bitcoin observations highlight a significant shift in GME‚Äôs market behavior. Bitcoin itself has experienced periods of intense volatility, but also extended phases of consolidation and more predictable movements. GME‚Äôs recent performance, staying within a defined range, suggests that the speculative fervor that once drove its price has cooled. This reduced GameStop Bitcoin volatility could be a sign of a more mature investor base or simply a market finding its equilibrium after extreme events. From Meme to Mature? GME‚Äôs journey from a speculative frenzy to a more stable asset. Predictable Patterns: Investors can observe clearer support and resistance levels. Investment Implications: Reduced volatility might appeal to a broader range of investors seeking less speculative opportunities. This unexpected parallel prompts us to reconsider how we categorize and analyze assets that have been at the center of retail trading phenomena. What Does This Mean for GameStop‚Äôs Market Evolution? Bill Gross Bitcoin insight points to a fascinating aspect of GameStop market evolution . If GME is indeed shedding its ‚Äúmeme stock‚Äù label and adopting price characteristics akin to Bitcoin, what does this imply for its future? This shift suggests that the market may be treating GameStop less as a speculative bet and more as an asset with established trading patterns. This GME Bitcoin comparison could mean: Increased Predictability: More stable price action allows for more traditional technical analysis. Wider Investor Appeal: Reduced risk might attract institutional investors or those previously wary of its extreme swings. Broader Crypto Market Trends: If GME mirrors Bitcoin, it might indirectly reflect broader sentiment or liquidity flows within the digital asset space, even if not directly tied to blockchain technology. It‚Äôs a testament to how markets adapt and evolve, even for assets that once defied conventional analysis. The ‚ÄúBond King‚Äôs‚Äù perspective offers a fresh lens through which to view GameStop‚Äôs place in the evolving financial landscape. Conclusion: A New Chapter for GameStop? Bill Gross‚Äôs compelling analysis truly offers a fresh perspective on GameStop. By highlighting the dramatic decline in GameStop Bitcoin volatility and its new, surprising resemblance to Bitcoin‚Äôs price patterns, he challenges the enduring ‚Äúmeme stock‚Äù narrative. This shift suggests GME may be entering a more mature phase, characterized by greater stability and potentially broader appeal beyond its dedicated retail base. As markets continue to evolve, understanding these unexpected parallels becomes crucial for investors navigating the complex interplay between traditional and digital assets.

Utilizing the Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP), this upgrade enables seamless USDC transfers across Avalanche (AVAX), Ethereum, and Base, eliminating costly bridge reliance. Supporting $219 billion in USDC trading volume, the integration has boosted Avalanche (AVAX)‚Äôs DeFi ecosystem, with TVL reaching $2 billion, per Invezz. Visa‚Äôs recent support for USDC settlement on Avalanche (AVAX) further strengthens its role in bridging traditional finance and Web3. Despite a recent dip to $21.41, AVAX‚Äôs trading volume spiked 40% to $1.2 billion. Technical indicators show support at $20.39 and resistance at $27.38, with an overbought RSI (72) suggesting a potential pullback. Avalanche (AVAX)‚Äôs low-fee, high-speed infrastructure positions it as a DeFi leader, though validator centralization remains a concern. Meeting the demand: Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs Layer-2 lending innovation Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is strategically positioned to meet the growing market needs exemplified by Avalanche (AVAX)‚Äôs USDC growth. Its platform uniquely combines a Layer-2 scalability solution with a dual lending system that optimizes both security and returns. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending mode will be especially noteworthy, allowing users to deposit stablecoins such as USDC and receive yield-generating mtTokens on a 1:1 basis. These mtTokens don‚Äôt just earn interest; they can also be staked in the designated smart contracts to earn dividends in MUTM tokens, creating multiple income streams for holders and strengthening the token‚Äôs ecosystem. What sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart is its design focused on scalability without compromising decentralization or security. The upcoming beta launch on Layer-2 will give users a firsthand experience with the platform‚Äôs speed and efficiency, pushing demand for MUTM tokens higher. This Layer-2 integration is a game-changer for users wanting to avoid the high fees and slow confirmations typical of many Layer-1 blockchains. In the middle of this promising outlook sits Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs current presale. With the token priced at $0.035 and over 14,800 holders already onboard, Phase 6 has seen 10% of its tokens sold, generating approximately $14.10 million in funding. This momentum isn‚Äôt just numbers; it reflects real investor confidence as MUTM prepares for its planned price increase to $0.040 in the upcoming phase. The combination of an attractive entry price and upcoming utility-driven catalysts makes MUTM a compelling choice for investors. A real investor success story and the roadmap ahead To illustrate Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs potential, consider an Avalanche (AVAX) investor who allocated $8,000 to MUTM during Phase 1, when the price was just $0.01. By the time MUTM reaches its expected listing price of $0.06, this investor‚Äôs position will have appreciated by 500%, turning that initial stake into $48,000. This example highlights not only the token‚Äôs strong growth prospects but also how early participation in Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs presale phases rewards forward-thinking investors with significant upside. Beyond price appreciation, the broader roadmap reinforces the token‚Äôs value proposition. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is committed to delivering on its promises with a structured rollout plan encompassing four detailed phases. These include progressive development milestones, the launch of their Layer-2 beta, the implementation of their decentralized stablecoin, and strategic listings on major exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance, KuCoin, MEXC, and Kraken. Each of these steps is designed to increase platform utility, user adoption, and ultimately, the demand for MUTM tokens. Confidence in Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs security and technology is further bolstered by its CertiK audit, which awarded it a Token Scan Score of 95. The audit process involved thorough manual reviews and static analysis, underscoring the project‚Äôs commitment to transparency and safety. This assurance helps build trust among potential investors who value rigorously tested smart contracts in today‚Äôs volatile crypto environment. Huge MUTM giveaway With a $100,000 giveaway and an active social media following exceeding 12,000 Twitter users, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is cultivating a vibrant community eager to support and engage with the platform‚Äôs growth. The current Phase 6, already 10% sold out, combined with the planned 15% price increase in the next phase, creates a strong sense of urgency among investors not to miss out on acquiring MUTM tokens at this discounted rate. As Avalanche (AVAX) continues to boost USDC adoption and reinforce the market for scalable DeFi solutions, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers an opportunity for investors to get ahead of the curve. With its innovative Layer-2 scaling, dual lending model, and clearly defined roadmap, MUTM is poised to deliver substantial growth and become a leading player in the evolving DeFi landscape. The time to act is now, while the token remains undervalued and its ecosystem is gearing up for a major breakthrough.

The recent implementation of new trade tariffs, particularly those involving major global economies, has sent a palpable tremor through the Forex Market Impact . While digital assets like Bitcoin often march to their own beat, macro-economic shifts, especially those affecting major fiat currencies, can indirectly influence investor sentiment and capital flows within the crypto space. Understanding these broader market movements is crucial for any investor looking to navigate the interconnected financial landscape. Understanding the Initial Shockwaves: What‚Äôs Muting Asia FX? The immediate aftermath of the new tariffs saw Asian currencies react with a cautious, almost muted response. This apparent calm, however, belies underlying anxieties and strategic positioning by central banks and investors alike. The imposition of tariffs by the United States on goods from key Asian economies has directly impacted export-reliant nations, leading to a slowdown in trade volumes and, consequently, a dampening effect on their respective currencies. The Trade War Tensions have forced many Asian central banks to consider intervention to stabilize their exchange rates, preventing excessive appreciation or depreciation that could further harm their economies. Consider the situation in China, where the Yuan has been under significant pressure. While direct intervention might not always be explicit, the People‚Äôs Bank of China (PBOC) has tools at its disposal to guide the currency. Other regional currencies, such as the South Korean Won, the Indonesian Rupiah, and the Indian Rupee, have also felt the squeeze. The muted reaction often reflects a wait-and-see approach, coupled with strategic efforts to manage market expectations. Key Factors Contributing to Muted Asia FX: Export Dependence: Many Asian economies are heavily reliant on exports, making them vulnerable to tariff impositions. Reduced demand for their goods translates to lower foreign currency earnings. Capital Outflows: Uncertainty stemming from trade disputes can trigger capital flight from emerging Asian markets as investors seek safer havens, putting downward pressure on local currencies. Central Bank Intervention: To prevent sharp currency movements that could destabilize their economies, central banks often step in, either by selling foreign reserves or adjusting interest rates, leading to a ‚Äòmuted‚Äô appearance rather than wild swings. Economic Slowdown Concerns: The tariffs threaten to slow down economic growth across the region, which naturally weakens the appeal of these currencies to international investors. The Dollar‚Äôs Dilemma: Why is US Dollar Strength Nursing Losses? Paradoxically, despite the US being the initiator of these tariffs, the US Dollar Strength has not been as robust as some might expect. While the dollar traditionally acts as a safe-haven currency during global uncertainties, the current scenario presents a more nuanced picture. The very tariffs designed to protect domestic industries are simultaneously creating headwinds for American businesses, particularly those reliant on global supply chains or export markets. This creates a ‚Äòdouble-edged sword‚Äô effect for the dollar. One major factor is the impact on corporate earnings. US companies with significant international operations are facing higher costs due to tariffs on imported components and reduced demand for their exports due to retaliatory tariffs. This can dampen investor confidence in US equities, subsequently affecting the dollar. Furthermore, market expectations regarding the Federal Reserve‚Äôs monetary policy play a critical role. If the trade war escalates and threatens US economic growth, the Fed might be compelled to adopt a more dovish stance, potentially leading to interest rate cuts. Lower interest rates typically reduce the attractiveness of holding dollar-denominated assets, thus weakening the currency. Challenges to Sustained US Dollar Strength: Economic Slowdown Risk: Tariffs can increase consumer prices and reduce corporate profits, potentially slowing US economic growth. Monetary Policy Expectations: Growing concerns about economic growth can lead to expectations of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, diminishing the dollar‚Äôs yield advantage. Global Retaliation: Other nations imposing retaliatory tariffs can harm US exports and multinational corporations, impacting the dollar‚Äôs underlying economic support. Fiscal Deficit Concerns: Increased government spending combined with potential revenue shortfalls due to trade disruptions can exacerbate the US fiscal deficit, raising long-term concerns for the dollar. Beyond Tariffs: How Are Trade War Tensions Reshaping Global Commerce? The ongoing Trade War Tensions extend far beyond the direct imposition of tariffs. They are fundamentally reshaping global supply chains, investment patterns, and the very fabric of international commerce. Businesses are now re-evaluating their manufacturing locations, sourcing strategies, and market access in response to increased uncertainty and protectionist policies. This strategic shift is leading to a significant re-alignment of global economic partnerships and trade routes. Companies that once thrived on efficient, interconnected global supply chains are now facing pressure to diversify their production bases or even reshore operations to mitigate tariff risks. This process is costly and time-consuming, leading to disruptions in production and higher consumer prices. Furthermore, the uncertainty discourages long-term foreign direct investment (FDI), as businesses are hesitant to commit capital in an unpredictable trade environment. The World Trade Organization (WTO), once a cornerstone of multilateral trade, finds its authority challenged, signaling a potential move towards more bilateral or regional trade agreements. Impact of Trade War Tensions on Global Commerce: Aspect Impact Example Supply Chains Diversification, Reshoring, Increased Costs Tech companies moving production out of China. Investment Reduced FDI, Increased Uncertainty Companies delaying new factory constructions abroad. Trade Volume Overall Decline, Shifting Trade Routes Decreased global shipping container traffic. International Relations Strained Partnerships, Rise of Bilateral Deals Increased focus on regional trade blocs over global ones. Navigating the Currents: What‚Äôs the Asia Currency Outlook Amidst Uncertainty? The Asia Currency Outlook remains a focal point of discussion among economists and investors. While the initial reaction was muted, the long-term implications of trade disputes could lead to more pronounced currency movements. Countries with strong domestic demand and less reliance on exports to the US might fare better. For instance, nations like India, with a large internal market, might be more resilient than export-heavy economies such as Vietnam or South Korea, although no country is entirely immune. Central banks in Asia are walking a tightrope, balancing the need to support economic growth with maintaining currency stability. Some may resort to capital controls or direct market interventions to prevent speculative attacks or excessive depreciation. The ongoing situation could also accelerate regional economic integration efforts, as Asian nations seek to bolster intra-regional trade to offset declining demand from Western markets. This could lead to a stronger reliance on currencies like the Chinese Yuan within the region, potentially challenging the dollar‚Äôs traditional dominance in Asian trade. Key Considerations for Asia Currency Outlook: Export Diversification: Countries successfully diversifying their export markets away from the US may see more stable currencies. Domestic Demand Strength: Economies with robust internal consumption can better withstand external shocks. Central Bank Reserves: Nations with substantial foreign exchange reserves have greater capacity to intervene and stabilize their currencies. Regional Trade Blocs: Increased integration within ASEAN or other Asian trade agreements could foster currency stability through increased intra-regional trade. Broader Horizons: What Does This Mean for the Global Economic Outlook? The cumulative effect of these trade disputes on the Global Economic Outlook is a cause for concern among international organizations and financial institutions. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank have repeatedly warned about the downside risks posed by escalating protectionism. A sustained period of trade friction could lead to a significant slowdown in global GDP growth, potentially pushing some economies into recession. Beyond the direct economic impact, there‚Äôs a risk of diminished global cooperation on other critical issues, such as climate change or financial stability, as nations become more inward-looking. Investors are increasingly seeking safe-haven assets like gold or certain government bonds, while re-evaluating their exposure to equity markets, particularly those tied to global trade. The overall Forex Market Impact is characterized by increased volatility and a tendency for capital to flow towards perceived safety, even if that safety comes with lower returns. This environment necessitates careful portfolio management and a deep understanding of geopolitical shifts. Potential Scenarios for the Global Economic Outlook: Base Case (Slowdown): Continued trade tensions lead to slower global growth, but a full-blown recession is avoided through policy adjustments and resilience. Worst Case (Recession): Escalation of trade wars, coupled with other geopolitical shocks, triggers a synchronized global recession. Best Case (De-escalation): A swift resolution to trade disputes, perhaps through new agreements, leads to a rebound in confidence and growth. Actionable Insights for Investors: How Can You Adapt? In an environment shaped by trade tariffs and shifting currency dynamics, investors need to be agile and informed. Here are some actionable insights: Diversify Your Portfolio: Beyond traditional asset classes, consider geographical diversification. Look into markets less directly exposed to the immediate trade tensions. Monitor Key Indicators: Keep a close eye on manufacturing PMIs, export data, and central bank statements from major economies. These provide early signals of economic health and policy direction. Consider Safe-Haven Assets: Gold, certain government bonds, and even some stablecoins (if you are in the crypto space) can act as hedges against volatility in traditional markets. Stay Informed on Geopolitics: Economic outcomes are increasingly tied to political decisions. Understanding the geopolitical landscape is as crucial as economic fundamentals. Embrace Long-Term Perspective: While short-term volatility is inevitable, focusing on long-term trends and strong fundamentals can help weather market storms. Avoid knee-jerk reactions to daily news cycles. Conclusion The current landscape, marked by muted Asia FX and a struggling US Dollar Strength amidst escalating Trade War Tensions, underscores the profound Forex Market Impact of protectionist policies. The ripple effects are undeniable, influencing the Asia Currency Outlook and casting a shadow over the entire Global Economic Outlook . While the immediate reactions might appear subtle, the long-term consequences are likely to be far-reaching, necessitating a strategic reassessment by businesses, policymakers, and investors worldwide. Navigating this complex environment requires vigilance, adaptability, and a comprehensive understanding of the interconnected forces at play. As the global economy continues to grapple with these challenges, staying informed and making calculated decisions will be paramount for financial resilience.

One of the biggest Ethereum whales moved this enormous sum, and while the exact reason behind the transfer isn‚Äôt publicly known, it has sparked widespread speculation about what might come next for Ethereum‚Äîand potentially for XRP too. Traders are watching closely because these moves often come just before major market shifts. With Ethereum gaining strength, XRP quietly building momentum, and altcoins starting to wake up, some investors are looking beyond the mainstream‚Äîand turning their attention to promising new projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE . Ethereum‚Äôs Strong Momentum Builds Confidence Ethereum has had an impressive comeback this year. In early August 2025, ETH climbed above $3,700 and delivered over 50% gains in just one month. That‚Äôs a huge leap compared to Bitcoin‚Äôs gain during the same period. The rally has been fueled by strong inflows into Ethereum ETFs, growing adoption in DeFi, and increased interest from large institutions. Many analysts now believe Ethereum could continue this upward trend, especially with major players like BlackRock increasing their ETH holdings. The recent whale transfer might be another sign that big investors are preparing for another major leg up. XRP‚Äôs Quiet Strength May Be Underestimated While XRP hasn‚Äôt made as much noise as Ethereum recently, it‚Äôs still one of the most closely watched altcoins. After years of legal uncertainty, the Ripple team has finally cleared many regulatory hurdles, giving investors renewed confidence in the project. XRP is now showing steady price strength, holding support levels and building quietly behind the scenes. Its focus on global payments and strong partnerships in the banking sector continue to give it long-term value. If Ethereum rallies further, it could trigger a broader altcoin push‚Äîone that XRP is well positioned to ride. ETH and XRP Look Strong‚ÄîBut MAGACOIN FINANCE Aims for 14,900% Gains As Ethereum and XRP capture headlines, a new name is quickly emerging in the crypto space: MAGACOIN FINANCE . This up-and-coming DeFi project is gaining serious momentum, especially among early investors looking for top crypto investments in 2025 and beyond. Early forecasts suggest that MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver up to 14,900% gains for early investors, thanks to its innovative DeFi features, powerful tokenomics, and fast-growing community. It‚Äôs still in its early stages, which means getting in now could be like catching Ethereum or XRP in their early days‚Äîbefore they became household names. Final Thoughts A $300 million Ethereum whale move is more than just a big transaction‚Äîit‚Äôs a signal that serious players are positioning for what could be the next big crypto rally. Ethereum is gaining steam, XRP is quietly building strength, and new projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are creating fresh excitement in the space. The presale is currently live, and interest is picking up fast. For those who missed out on the early days of Ethereum or XRP, MAGACOIN FINANCE could offer a second chance to get in early on a major winner.

Many investors are keenly watching for signs of what‚Äôs next for the leading digital asset. A prominent voice in the crypto space has recently shared his insights, suggesting that while some short-term pressures have eased, the broader bullish trend for Bitcoin remains intact. Has Short-Term Overheating Subsided for the BTC Market Outlook? According to Crypto Dan, a well-regarded crypto analyst and contributor to CryptoQuant, Bitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) recent short-term overheating has indeed subsided. This is a crucial development for the overall BTC market outlook . He noted on his official Telegram channel that Bitcoin‚Äôs market conditions have returned to levels seen before its notable rebound in June. What‚Äôs particularly interesting is that this occurred without any major price corrections, indicating a healthy rebalancing rather than a crash. This observation offers a sigh of relief for many, as rapid price increases often lead to concerns about unsustainable growth. The market appears to have naturally absorbed some of the speculative heat, allowing for a more stable foundation moving forward. What‚Äôs Impacting Current Bitcoin Price Action? Despite the cooling of short-term overheating, Bitcoin has recently shown a rather sluggish trajectory. This can be largely attributed to significant capital outflows from spot BTC Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). These outflows suggest that institutional and larger retail investors might be taking a cautious stance or reallocating their portfolios, which naturally impacts the Bitcoin price action . It‚Äôs important to understand that ETF flows are a significant indicator of institutional interest and broader market sentiment. When these funds experience net outflows, it can create selling pressure and dampen price momentum. However, this period of ‚Äúfunk,‚Äù as the analyst describes it, doesn‚Äôt necessarily signal the end of the current bull run. It might simply be a phase of consolidation or a temporary pause as the market digests recent gains and adjusts to new capital dynamics. Is the Current Bitcoin Bull Cycle Truly Over? A Crypto Analyst View From a broader perspective, Crypto Dan firmly believes that the current Bitcoin bull cycle is far from over. This is a reassuring sentiment for long-term holders and those looking to enter the market. Despite some indicators still showing signs of previous overheating, the analyst maintains that the overall likelihood of BTC entering a significant downturn remains low. His crypto analyst view suggests that the underlying fundamentals supporting Bitcoin‚Äôs growth are still strong. This perspective encourages investors to look beyond daily fluctuations and focus on the larger market trends and Bitcoin‚Äôs enduring value proposition. Key takeaways from this expert perspective include: Market Rebalancing: The short-term overheating has resolved without a crash. Temporary Slowdown: ETF outflows contribute to current sluggishness, but it‚Äôs not a fundamental collapse. Long-Term Optimism: The broader bull cycle narrative remains intact. Navigating the Market: What‚Äôs Next for This Crypto Market Analysis? For investors, understanding this nuanced outlook is key. While the market might continue to experience periods of ‚Äúfunk‚Äù or sideways movement, the overarching theme, according to this crypto market analysis , is one of continued bullish potential. This doesn‚Äôt mean Bitcoin will see explosive growth every day, but rather that its long-term upward trajectory is still in play. It‚Äôs crucial for market participants to: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on key indicators and expert opinions, like this crypto analyst view . Manage Expectations: Recognize that market cycles involve periods of consolidation. Consider Long-Term Strategy: Avoid panic selling based on short-term dips in Bitcoin price action . The market is dynamic, and while the path may not always be smooth, the foundational strength of Bitcoin and the broader crypto ecosystem appears robust, supporting the ongoing Bitcoin bull cycle . Summary: Crypto Dan‚Äôs analysis provides a calming perspective amidst recent market sluggishness. He asserts that Bitcoin‚Äôs short-term overheating has naturally subsided, preventing a major correction. Despite recent capital outflows impacting Bitcoin price action , his expert crypto analyst view is that the current Bitcoin bull cycle is not over. This comprehensive crypto market analysis suggests that while periods of ‚Äúfunk‚Äù may persist, the long-term outlook for BTC remains positive, offering a strong foundation for continued growth rather than a significant downturn. Power Word: Resilient Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does ‚Äúshort-term overheating‚Äù in BTC mean? A1: Short-term overheating refers to a rapid and unsustainable price increase in Bitcoin, often driven by excessive speculation, which can lead to a sharp correction. When it ‚Äúsubsides,‚Äù it means the market has rebalanced without a significant crash, improving the overall BTC market outlook . Q2: Why have spot BTC ETFs seen capital outflows? A2: Capital outflows from spot BTC ETFs can occur for various reasons, including investors taking profits, rebalancing portfolios, or reacting to broader economic uncertainties. These outflows indicate a decrease in demand from institutional investors and can impact Bitcoin price action . Q3: What indicates that the Bitcoin bull cycle is not over? A3: According to the analyst, despite some signs of overheating and current sluggishness, the underlying market structure and broader trends suggest the Bitcoin bull cycle‚Äôs continuation. This view often considers long-term adoption, technological advancements, and macro factors over short-term price movements. Q4: How should investors react to the current ‚Äúfunk‚Äù in the market? A4: Investors should focus on long-term strategies, avoid panic selling, and stay informed. Periods of sluggishness are normal in market cycles and do not necessarily signal the end of a bull run. It can even present opportunities for those with a long-term perspective, according to this crypto market analysis . Q5: What is the significance of a ‚Äúcrypto analyst view‚Äù in understanding market trends? A5: A crypto analyst view provides expert interpretation of complex market data and indicators. Analysts like Crypto Dan use their experience and tools to offer insights into potential future movements, helping investors make more informed decisions by looking beyond daily volatility.

It continues to steal the spotlight after revealing key details about its upcoming wallet and building momentum with its $250,000 giveaway.

With growing interest in high-growth crypto assets that combine real-world utility with low gas fees, the Remittix DeFi project is shaping up to be a clear contender in the battle for the best crypto to buy in 2025. Solana Price Rebounds But Faces Pressure From Upstarts Solana price jumped back above $165 after a week of mild selloffs, supported by renewed NFT market activity and a slight uptick in DeFi volume. A partnership announcement with Render Network helped strengthen sentiment, with users applauding Solana‚Äôs fast settlement times and low transaction fees. Solana price prediction shows that it maintains a higher low structure and is currently forming a bullish reversal from a key ascending trendline. With this, it currently has targets of $260, $312 and $356. Cardano Price Sees Modest Gains Amid Technical Strength The Cardano price currently sits around $0.74, up 3% in the last 48 hours after founder Charles Hoskinson hinted at a ‚Äúbig September announcement.‚Äù ADA continues to see solid staking interest and long-term holder confidence, but short-term price action remains range-bound. Experts have pointed out that Cardano is pacing itself with deliberate, infrastructure-first growth. With this, Cardano price momentum is building quietly. Analysts now expect a bullish move toward $2.36 . Why Remittix Is The Best Crypto To Buy Right Now While Solana and Cardano price continue making headlines, it‚Äôs Remittix that‚Äôs quietly stealing the thunder. Built as a cross-chain DeFi project for global payments, Remittix isn‚Äôt about hype but is about solving a real-world $19 trillion settlement problem.

Other analysts, including Arthur Hayes and Joe Burnett, also have optimistic targets, while firms like Bernstein and Standard Chartered expect more modest gains around $200,000. Meanwhile, IREN Ltd outperformed industry heavyweight MARA in July by mining more Bitcoin despite having a smaller hashrate. The mining firm also saw its stock rally 11.4% as it expands into AI cloud services. Bitcoin Could Hit $250K in 2025 Fundstrat co-founder and BitMine chairman Tom Lee once again talked about his bullish stance on Bitcoin, and predicted that the leading cryptocurrency could still surge to $250,000 by the end of 2025. In an interview on the Coin Stories podcast with Natalie Brunell , Lee shared that he is confident that Bitcoin will build momentum before the year concludes, and suggested a range between $200,000 and $250,000 is within reach. This projection was made after his previous call in November of 2024, when he gave Bitcoin a 12-month window to hit the $250,000 mark. While Lee is clearly still very optimistic, other analysts started to adopt more tempered expectations. Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, and Joe Burnett of Unchained have similar bullish targets , but firms like Bernstein and Standard Chartered set their year-end forecasts at $200,000. Meanwhile, 10x Research‚Äôs Markus Thielen presented a more conservative estimate of $160,000. These varied predictions come during the broader debate about the relevance of Bitcoin‚Äôs historical four-year halving cycle. Lee argues that institutional adoption is reshaping Bitcoin‚Äôs trajectory, which could possibly render traditional market cycles less predictive. Still, not everyone agrees. Analyst Rekt Capital recently said that if Bitcoin mirrors its 2020 performance, the market could peak around October 2025, which is roughly 550 days after the latest halving event in April of 2024. On the other hand, Matt Hougan , chief investment officer at Bitwise, went as far as to call the four-year halving cycle ‚Äúdead,‚Äù and projected that 2026 could instead be Bitcoin‚Äôs next major growth year. Despite the uncertainty, Lee sees the current skepticism in the market as a positive force. He believes that widespread doubt leaves room for positive surprises and sustained price discovery. Crypto Fear and Greed Index (Source: Alternative ) The recent shift in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index from ‚ÄúGreed‚Äù to ‚ÄúNeutral‚Äù also reflects this growing caution among investors. Still, Lee is quite steadfast in his long-term view, and ultimately predicted Bitcoin could reach $1 million ‚Äúover time‚Äù as adoption and institutional interest continue to grow. IREN Tops MARA in July BTC Mining In other Bitcoin-related news, shares of Bitcoin mining firm IREN Ltd surged 11.4% on Wednesday after the company reported strong July results. This included $86 million in revenue and the production of 728 Bitcoin. IREN Bitcoin mined (Source: IREN ) Interestingly, this output was more than that of industry giant MARA Holdings, which mined 703 BTC during the same period despite operating a larger deployed hashrate of 58.9 exahashes per second (EH/s) compared to IREN‚Äôs 50 EH/s. IREN‚Äôs average hashrate for the month was 45.4 EH/s, which indicates high operational efficiency and machine uptime despite rising mining difficulty and energy costs that recently pressured the sector‚Äôs profitability. MARA‚Äôs performance, although trailing IREN in July production, came after a robust second-quarter earnings report showing a 64% year-on-year revenue increase to $238 million. MARA also maintains the second-largest corporate Bitcoin treasury by holding 50,000 BTC , second only to Michael Saylor‚Äôs Strategy. After the announcement, IREN shares closed at $18.32, which pushed its market cap to $4.11 billion. This positioned IREN as the second most valuable publicly traded Bitcoin miner, surpassing both Riot Platforms and Core Scientific, and trailing only MARA. The stock‚Äôs strong performance also proves that there is growing investor confidence in IREN‚Äôs strategy to diversify beyond Bitcoin mining. IREN‚Äôs share price over the past 24 hours (Source: Google Finance ) A $2.3 million of IREN‚Äôs July revenue came from its AI cloud business, which is becoming an important part of its operations. The company recently acquired 2,400 of NVIDIA‚Äôs advanced Blackwell GPUs, with 256 units already delivered. Co-founder and co-CEO Daniel Roberts pointed out the strong market interest in the AI segment, and believes the synergy between running Bitcoin mining and AI infrastructure side-by-side is a strategic advantage. IREN‚Äôs turnaround is particularly impressive when considering it was labeled ‚Äúwildly overvalued‚Äù last year by short-selling firm Culper Research. The firm criticized IREN‚Äôs AI ambitions, and even compared them to attempting a Grand Prix in a Toyota Prius. However, since bottoming at $5.59 in April, IREN‚Äôs stock rallied over 227%, defying the earlier skepticism.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|MINING|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-07 05:30:00

Binance, a leader in the digital asset space, consistently provides transparency through its monthly Binance Proof of Reserves reports. These reports offer a fascinating glimpse into the platform‚Äôs holdings, assuring users about the backing of their assets and fostering trust in the ecosystem. Unpacking Binance‚Äôs August Proof of Reserves Report Binance recently released its 33rd Proof of Reserves report, based on an August 1st snapshot. This detailed report gives us a clear picture of the exchange‚Äôs asset backing. It highlights significant shifts in the platform‚Äôs asset distribution, providing valuable insights into market dynamics and user activity. Bitcoin (BTC) Holdings: User BTC holdings reached 591,164, marking a healthy 2.99% increase from the previous month. This growth reflects continued user confidence and accumulation of the leading cryptocurrency. Ethereum (ETH) Holdings: ETH holdings experienced a notable decline, falling 9.84% to 4.555 million. This reduction in Ethereum decline suggests potential shifts in user preferences or broader market trends impacting the second-largest cryptocurrency. Tether (USDT) Holdings: USDT holdings saw a modest rise of 0.87%, reaching 29.855 billion. The stability of USDT holdings is crucial, as it indicates consistent demand for the widely used stablecoin for trading and hedging. These figures, initially reported by Wu Blockchain on X, provide a transparent view of Binance‚Äôs commitments to its users. Why Do Binance Holdings Matter for Users? Understanding Binance holdings is crucial for any cryptocurrency user. Proof of Reserves reports are more than just numbers; they are a vital tool for ensuring accountability and solvency in the crypto industry. They demonstrate that an exchange holds sufficient assets to cover user deposits, preventing situations like those seen with less transparent platforms in the past. For users, this transparency builds confidence. It allows them to verify that their funds are genuinely backed by the exchange‚Äôs reserves, reducing systemic risk and promoting a healthier, more secure trading environment. Moreover, tracking these reports helps users assess the overall health and stability of the platform they choose for their crypto activities. Decoding the Shifts: Bitcoin Gains and Ethereum‚Äôs Dip The latest report reveals interesting trends. The increase in Bitcoin holdings could stem from several factors. It might indicate a flight to quality during uncertain market times, as Bitcoin is often seen as a safe haven asset. Alternatively, it could be a result of increased user deposits into BTC, reflecting growing bullish sentiment or long-term investment strategies. Conversely, the Ethereum decline warrants attention. This decrease could be due to users withdrawing ETH for staking on the Beacon Chain, participating in DeFi protocols off-exchange, or simply diversifying into other assets. Market corrections or shifts in investor interest towards other Layer 1 blockchains might also play a role in this observed trend. It‚Äôs important to view these movements within the context of the broader cryptocurrency market. The Future of Crypto Reserves and Industry Transparency Binance‚Äôs consistent publication of its crypto reserves reports sets a high standard for the industry. This commitment to transparency is fundamental for fostering trust, especially in a sector that has faced scrutiny regarding its operational integrity. As the cryptocurrency market matures, such regular audits and disclosures will become increasingly important for regulatory acceptance and mainstream adoption. The ongoing commitment to Proof of Reserves helps to mitigate risks and ensures that exchanges remain accountable to their users. It promotes a healthier ecosystem where users can make informed decisions based on verifiable data, not just promises. This level of transparency is key to building a robust and resilient digital asset future. In summary, Binance‚Äôs August Proof of Reserves report paints a clear picture: a robust increase in Bitcoin and USDT holdings underscores strong user confidence and stablecoin demand, while the observed Ethereum decline prompts a deeper look into evolving market dynamics. These reports are invaluable for maintaining trust and transparency in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Binance Proof of Reserves?

El-Erian argued that the Fed would have cut interest rates if it had known about the July employment revisions in advance. El-Erian stated, ‚ÄúIf the Fed had seen the July employment revisions before the meeting, it would have definitely cut interest rates,‚Äù adding that current market conditions reflect the weakening economy. He emphasized that recent data indicates a significant decline in spending by low-income households, which he said is also reflected in corporate balance sheets. He noted that interest rate cut expectations in the US bond market have reached 90%, making it almost certain that the Fed will cut rates by at least 25 basis points in September. El-Erian said a 25 basis point cut in September was a certainty, but a larger 50 basis point cut was a possibility. Recalling that the Fed has made similar surprise moves in the past, he said, ‚ÄúLast year, they did nothing in July, and then in September, they made a jumbo 50 basis point cut.‚Äù Related News: Bitcoin Bull Economist Compares Solana and Ethereum: Reveals Which One Is Better El-Erian criticized President Trump's dismissal of the BLS head, arguing that the move undermined the institutional integrity of US economic data production. ‚ÄúSuch dismissals undermine trust in the impartiality of statistical institutions,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis poses a serious problem for market confidence.‚Äù El-Erian reiterated that Fed Chair Jerome Powell should resign before his term expires. ‚ÄúPowell is leaving in May anyway,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHowever, as long as he remains in office, political pressure will increase, and this could undermine the Fed's independence,‚Äù he said, adding that this step would be the best choice to preserve the institutional structure. Trump's comments that he is considering Kevin Hassett and Kevin Warsh as the new Fed Chair, while Treasury Secretary Scott Besson's statement that he does not want the position, also came up on the program. El-Erian said that Chris Warsh and Kevin Warsh would be positive choices for the Fed's independence. *This is not investment advice.

Here Are the Details‚Ä¶,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/unexpected-development-in-binance-founder-czs-memecoin-altcoin-price-takes-a-sudden-dump-here-are-the-details/,"An unexpected development occurred in the altcoin called TST, which was launched in the first months of 2025 and caused havoc. The Test (TST) token, which Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) promoted and said was for testing purposes only and is also listed on Binance, experienced a sharp drop on Binance this morning. TST price dropped from $0.045 to $0.0159 in about 15 minutes. This represents a drop of over 60%. Having seen a small recovery after the sharp decline, TST continues to trade at $0.026 at the time of writing. TST and CZ Explanations! The TST token brought criticism with its launch. The listing of TST on Binance in a short time and the claims that it was CZ's own token increased speculation in the market. Speaking about speculations that he was involved in the token's launch, CZ maintained that TST was never sponsored by him or Binance. While CZ said TST was initially created for a video tutorial and has no official support, his attempts to clarify the situation have further fueled interest in the token. Sudden Drops Have Happened Before! On Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, some altcoins, especially ACT, experienced sudden and sharp declines exceeding 50%. At this point, altcoins such as ACT, TST, MASK, LEVER, TUT, DF, and AIXBT have experienced sharp declines in the previous months. Related News: Strange Situations Are Happening in Altcoins!

While PEPE grabs headlines with excitement, MUTM is steadily building the future of decentralized finance. A balanced opportunity against wild volatility Unlike PEPE‚Äôs hype-driven surges, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be built around a functional architecture that targets stability and growth. The platform will operate a dual lending system, starting with Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending. Here, users will deposit dependable assets such as USDC, AVAX, and LINK into shared liquidity pools. These deposits will generate stable APYs ranging between 9% and 12% (depending on the pool utilization), making the opportunity appealing for those seeking consistent yield. Depositors will receive mtTokens on a 1:1 basis, which not only will accrue interest automatically but also will unlock staking rewards paid out in MUTM tokens if staked in the smart contracts. This model will ensure that users benefit directly from their participation in the protocol‚Äôs liquidity, creating a steady income stream in addition to capital appreciation. The second lending layer will be Peer-to-Peer (P2P), which will be crafted for high-risk, high-reward players. This part of the platform will allow loans to be issued and collateralized with speculative tokens such as PEPE, DOGE, FLOKI, BONK, and TRUMP. These contracts will be directly negotiated between lenders and borrowers, providing flexibility in terms and interest rates. Crucially, the risks and rewards of P2P lending will remain isolated from the more stable P2C pools, ensuring the core platform stays secure and resilient against volatility in speculative assets. This layered approach to lending will position Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a comprehensive DeFi ecosystem catering to both conservative and aggressive investors. Currently, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in its Phase 6 presale, with the price set at $0.035. To date, the project has raised $14.1 million, gathered nearly 14,800 holders, and sold 10% of the token supply. This is the last discounted phase, and once it concludes, the price will rise to $0.040‚Äîa 15% increase that marks the final opportunity to buy in at an early price point. Early participation means locking in a discounted entry before the wider market access opens, which positions investors to capitalize on upcoming momentum. Why experts and early investors are excited Analysts who have a strong track record, including accurate forecasts for Polkadot (DOT)‚Äôs breakout and early Solana (SOL) growth, are now projecting Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to reach $1.05 by mid-2026. This forecast is based on the project‚Äôs unique dual lending mechanics, anticipated Layer-2 integration for faster transactions, and a full launch of its beta platform. One confident investor swapped $4,000 from AVAX into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) during Phase 1 and is now sitting on a $14,000 unrealized stake‚Äîa 250% gain before the token even hits major exchanges. This same stake is expected to surpass $60,000 once the beta launches and key exchange listings materialize, showcasing a substantial return driven by increasing staking demand and token buybacks. The platform‚Äôs roadmap, divided into four distinct phases, will guide Mutuum Finance (MUTM) from presale through development, audit completion, and ultimately to multichain Layer-2 launch. The upcoming beta release will allow users to experience the protocol firsthand, bringing real-world utility to the project and fueling further token demand. Security and transparency have been top priorities, reflected by Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs high CertiK audit score of 95 and a solid Skynet rating of 78. The project also runs a bug bounty program to encourage the community to report vulnerabilities, reinforcing its commitment to safety. Additionally, the project is energizing its community with a $100,000 giveaway, distributing MUTM tokens to ten lucky winners, which helps build a loyal and engaged supporter base. Final words While PEPE dazzles with flashy social-driven pumps, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is methodically building a sustainable ecosystem with real lending use cases and long-term value drivers. The $0.035 price point in this presale phase is fleeting‚Äîonce the token moves to $0.040, the easy entry window closes. For those who want to combine growth with security, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a clear, calculated path that blends stable yields, high-risk options, and a well-structured development plan. As August unfolds, investors looking beyond mere hype are turning to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the smarter, more balanced choice under $0.05. Time is running out to join this presale phase, and the rewards for early entry promise to be significant as the project advances toward its full potential.

In its first-half earnings call on Tuesday, KakaoBank CFO Kwon Tae-hoon said the firm is ‚Äúactively considering‚Äù roles in both stablecoin issuance and custody, with participation aligned to the country‚Äôs shifting digital asset policies. ‚ÄúWe plan to engage actively in line with market changes,‚Äù Kwon said, adding that KakaoBank‚Äôs internal task force is working with other Kakao units to consolidate strategy. Join the crypto policy conversation Sept. 10 in D.C. ‚Äî Register now for CoinDesk: Policy & Regulation . The move adds a regulated online bank to the list of Korean fintechs jumping into the stablecoin race after the Bank of Korea (BOK) shelved its central bank digital currency (CBDC) pilot in June. The project, as CoinDesk previously reported had reached the testing phase with commercial banks and abruptly halted after President Lee Jae-myung‚Äôs administration submitted legislation enabling the local issuance of stablecoins. Kwon emphasized KakaoBank‚Äôs technical readiness, noting the firm had participated in both phases of the now-cancelled BOK pilot. ‚ÄúWe built and operated wallets and handled exchanges and transfers,‚Äù he said, pointing to operational experience most firms in the sector can‚Äôt yet claim. He also cited three years of compliance work issuing real-name accounts for crypto exchanges, giving the bank a head start in implementing the kind of KYC and AML frameworks regulators are likely to demand for fiat-pegged tokens. KakaoBank is part of a weekly stablecoin-focused task force within the Kakao ecosystem, working alongside KakaoPay and the parent group. CEOs Chung Shin-ah (Kakao), Shin Won-keun (KakaoPay), and Yoon Ho-young (KakaoBank) are leading the initiative. The stablecoin pivot has ignited a wave of speculation and retail activity in Korea‚Äôs markets. Circle stock, which went public in June, became the most-purchased foreign equity among Korean retail investors.

Analysts predict it could hit $2 post-launch, offering a 20x return compared to PEPE‚Äôs projected gains. Consequently, investors are eyeing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for its robust utility and scalability. Pepe Coin‚Äôs limited upside Pepe Coin (PEPE) is surfing on the optimism cycle within the meme coin segment. Its fee is at 0.000011, and momentum indicators such as RSI and MACD are pointing to fresh buying pressure. If PEPE breaks the $0.000014 resistance, a 5x increase to $0.000055 in 2025 is feasible. Moreover, positive funding rates and long traders dominating shorts bolster short-term confidence. However, PEPE‚Äôs lack of a utility-driven roadmap raises concerns. Without a clear development plan, its long-term potential remains uncertain. Thus, while PEPE may offer quick gains, its speculative nature limits its appeal compared to projects with stronger fundamentals. Mutuum Finance‚Äôs presale momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 6 of its 11-phase presale, with tokens priced at $0.035, a 250% increase from the $0.01 starting price. Over $14,100,000 has been raised, with 665 million tokens sold to 14,900 holders. Phase 6 is selling out fast, and the window to secure tokens at this price is closing rapidly. Furthermore, Phase 7 will bring a 14.3% price hike to $0.04, with the launch price set at $0.06, guaranteeing a 71% ROI for current buyers. Investors purchasing now could see a 57x return if Mutuum Finance (MUTM) reaches its projected $2 post-launch in 2025. Innovative lending ecosystem Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a decentralized lending platform that blends peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-contract (P2C) models. This two-fold system enables the user to earn specifically at stablecoins such as USDC or layer ones such as ETH at a stable 12% APY, or instead P2P lending with memecoins such as DOGE at up to 33% APY. Additionally, its overcollateralized stablecoin system ensures stability by minting tokens only during loans and burning them upon repayment. Operating on a Layer-2 network, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) slashes gas fees by up to 90%, boosting accessibility. Consequently, this scalability drives token demand, supporting long-term price growth. Security and community engagement Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has finalized a CertiK audit, earning a 95.00 security score with no vulnerabilities in its smart contracts. The team has also launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program with CertiK, rewarding discoveries across critical, major, minor, and low severity tiers. Furthermore, a $100,000 MUTM giveaway is underway, splitting $10,000 among 10 winners who invest $50 in the presale and complete simple tasks. The team has introduced a leaderboard rewarding the top 50 holders with bonus tokens, fostering loyalty. These initiatives underscore Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs commitment to trust and community, enhancing its appeal in the crypto investment space. Why Mutuum Finance outshines Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just another altcoin; it‚Äôs a high-utility DeFi project with a 4 billion token cap and a clear roadmap. Its Layer-2 integration, dual lending model, and stablecoin system position it for mass adoption. While Pepe Coin (PEPE) may deliver a 5x return, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs projected 20x surge to $2 in 2025 offers unmatched potential.

He also believes South Korea will face the most favourable U.S. tariff rates on chips. U.S. President Donald Trump warned on Wednesday that countries that do not produce semiconductors in the U.S., or are planning to do so, will face 100% tariffs on semiconductor exports to the U.S. He also exempted countries that had made a commitment to manufacture chips in the U.S. or were in the process of doing so.

Yeo Han-koo also said he hoped there would be a trade deal between Washington and Seoul on semiconductors, but he did not elaborate further. South Korea‚Äôs Samsung owns two chip fabrication sites in Texas, one in Austin and another in Taylor. The firm‚Äôs new site is part of a larger expansion to boost domestic chip manufacturing. The Center for American Progress revealed that the project is under the CHIPS and Science Act, which provides incentives for domestic chip manufacturing. The U.S. Commerce Department granted SK Hynix $458M last year to support the construction of a chip packaging plant in West Lafayette, Indiana. The South Korean firm also announced that it plans to invest $3.87 billion in the project, and the government will provide $500 million in loans as part of the deal. ‚ÄúWhile both Samsung and SK Hynix have made U.S. investments, there are doubts about whether SK Hynix‚Äôs packaging plant alone would fully qualify for tariff exemptions.‚Äù ‚Äì Baik Gil-hyun, Analyst at Yuanta Securities. At the time of publication, Samsung Electronics‚Äô share price saw a 1.74% surge in the last 24 hours, to 70,050 Korean won. SK Hynix‚Äôs stock price also saw a mere 0.3% rise in the last 24 hours to 259,250 KRW. Trump announced last week that the U.S. had agreed to a trade deal with the Republic of Korea. He imposed a 15% levy on imports from the Asian trading partner.

The iPhone maker revealed on Wednesday that the South Korean company will supply chips from its production plant in Texas for Apple products. Apple said on Thursday that it‚Äôs working with Samsung at its fab in Austin to launch an innovative new technology for manufacturing chips. The company said the initiative will allow the facility to supply chips that optimize the power and performance of Apple products, including iPhones. Kiwoom Securities analyst Park Yu-ak argued that the chips in question are likely image sensors for next-generation iPhones. He believes the initiative of producing image sensors for the iPhone 18 next year would boost sales in Samsung‚Äôs semiconductor division. Sony has been Apple‚Äôs source for image sensors for iPhones. It accounted for over 50% of the global image sensor market as of last year, while Samsung accounted for 15.4%. The iPhone maker also revealed that it would spend an additional $100 billion in U.S. investments, reaching $600 billion in investments in the U.S. over the next four years.

XRP and ETH Analysts Make Bold Calls,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-to-250k-in-q4-xrp-and-eth-analysts-make-bold-calls/,"Bitcoin bulls are back with a vengeance. After topping $123,000 earlier this year and breaking into a steady climb above $140,000, some top analysts are now forecasting a potential move toward $250,000 by Q4 2025. The driver? A potent mix of institutional capital, ETF momentum, and dwindling sell pressure from long-term holders. According to data from leading on-chain platforms, whale accumulation continues at a record pace, while major ETF inflows‚Äîespecially from BlackRock and Trump Media‚Äôs Crypto Blue Chip ETF‚Äîare fueling new capital rotation into digital assets. This bullish setup is also lifting altcoins, with analysts now predicting sharp upside for both XRP and Ethereum. And in the background, presale assets like MAGACOIN FINANCE are gaining traction as retail and early-stage buyers look for the next asymmetric bet. XRP Sets Sights on $4.50 With New Legal Milestone XRP continues to ride waves of momentum, recently breaking past the $3.14 resistance and holding above key support at $3.03. Legal experts say Ripple is closing in on a final resolution with the SEC, which could open the door to XRP ETF approvals and expanded U.S. utility. Ripple‚Äôs recent application to launch the Ripple National Trust Bank ‚Äîa federally regulated institution focused on custody and stablecoin operations‚Äîhas only added to the bullish narrative. As traders digest this shift from courtroom drama to banking-grade infrastructure, the chart tells its own story. Analysts now see targets at $3.69, $4.50, and even $5.10 if breakout momentum holds into September. Ethereum‚Äôs Bullish Run Eyes $4,234 and Beyond Ethereum is surging, up over 40% in the past month and holding strong near $3,700. Analysts cite consistent inflows into ETH-focused ETFs, expanding tokenization products, and increasing L2 usage as key catalysts behind the rally. Current resistance lies at $3,881 and $4,234, but sentiment remains bullish into Q4. With Ethereum expected to play a leading role in future tokenized banking systems, it remains a cornerstone asset for both retail and institutional portfolios. While price action may see temporary retracements, the long-term trajectory appears to be tracking higher‚Äîespecially if Bitcoin reaches that $250K milestone. Momentum Builds Around Viral Altcoin as Analysts Eye 40x Returns As Bitcoin leads the way and top altcoins follow, early-stage traders are turning to breakout projects that mirror previous cycles. One such name attracting major attention is MAGACOIN FINANCE. Bitcoin to $250K? MAGACOIN FINANCE Analysts Predict Bigger Upside with 40x Presale Surge , citing early whale activity, aggressive participation, and viral growth mechanics similar to early DOGE and SHIBA. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is the timing‚Äîit‚Äôs capitalizing on ETF-driven market optimism while still offering presale access, making it a high-conviction target for investors looking beyond the top 10. This convergence of trust signals and strategic whale action is making MAGACOIN FINANCE one of the most talked-about altcoins in the past month. Investors who missed XRP‚Äôs rise are watching closely ‚Äì and some are already positioning accordingly. Conclusion: Bull Market Energy Is Returning With Bitcoin setting the pace toward $250K and altcoins like XRP and Ethereum showing strong bullish patterns, Q4 could mark the start of the most explosive phase of the 2025 cycle. But it‚Äôs not just the top coins gaining traction‚ÄîMAGACOIN FINANCE is proving that early-stage plays are back in focus. As capital rotates and confidence returns, those positioned early may find themselves ahead of the next big move.

Project Crypto, The ‚ÄòMost Bullish‚Äô Document On Tuesday, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan discussed the SEC Chair‚Äôs recent speech, titled ‚ÄúAmerican Leadership in the Digital Finance Revolution.‚Äù In a memo to clients, Hougan affirmed that ‚Äúthe most bullish document (‚Ä¶) on crypto wasn‚Äôt written by some Yahoo on Twitter. It was written by the chairman of the SEC.‚Äù As reported by Bitcoinist, Paul Atkins outlined his vision for the financial markets over the next years in a speech to the America First Policy Institute. In the speech, the SEC Chain unveiled the ‚ÄúProject Crypto‚Äù initiative, which aims to transform the US into the ‚Äúcrypto capital of the world.‚Äù The commission-wide initiative is expected to modernize securities rules and regulations, enabling US financial markets to move on-chain and ‚Äúhelp ensure that the United States remains the best place in the world to start a business, develop cutting-edge technologies, and participate in capital markets.‚Äù Atkins‚Äôs speech is ‚Äúthe most complete vision of how crypto can reshape financial markets,‚Äù the Bitwise CIO affirmed, arguing that it seems like the SEC Chair ‚Äútook all the best ideas crypto supporters have been promoting for the past decade and packaged them in a single speech, along with details on how the SEC can actually make them happen.‚Äù Hougan suggested that the most obvious question is whether the SEC‚Äôs vision was priced in. If the markets were already anticipating the SEC shift from ‚Äúcrypto antagonist to crypto catalyst,‚Äù then it should already be factored into the price of most digital assets. Nonetheless, he argued that he realized it is time to ‚Äúthink bigger‚Äù and ‚Äúmove to a faster timeline‚Äù after reading the speech, concluding that ‚ÄúIf it wasn‚Äôt priced in for me, I‚Äôm going to guess it wasn‚Äôt priced in for others.‚Äù Opening The Door For Key Opportunities In the memo, Hougan highlighted that there‚Äôs ‚Äúa lot to unpack‚Äù from Atkins‚Äôs remarks, ‚Äúyou could build an entire venture capital firm around the chairman‚Äôs vision, creating companies to capitalize on each opportunity he lays out,‚Äù he continued. However, he asserted that three immediate investment opportunities stand out, starting with investing in Ethereum and other Layer 1 blockchains that support stablecoins and tokenization. He argued that, as US regulators and lawmakers work to modernize rules and create legal frameworks to bring the financial market on-chain, gaining exposure to the underlying platforms is crucial. The best approach is likely to buy a basket of the leading assets: Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, XRP, Avalanche, Aptos, Sui, NEAR, and so on. A second opportunity rises in what Atkins called ‚ÄúSuper-Apps,‚Äù which are platforms offering a broader range of financial services. In the speech, the SEC chair argued that broker-dealers should be able to offer crypto and traditional trading, and services like staking and lending, without ‚Äúrequiring fifty-plus state licenses or multiple federal licenses.‚Äù To Bitwise CIO, platforms like Coinbase and Robinhood have embraced the super-app concept and ‚Äúcould become the largest financial services company in the world, maybe even becoming the first financial services company worth more than $1 trillion,‚Äù with the SEC‚Äôs roadmap . Lastly, Hougan affirmed that DeFi applications are another major opportunity standing out, explaining that these apps have surged in a ‚Äúregulatory gray zone‚Äù that has constrained their growth. ‚ÄúDeFi is not just a technical revolution, but a conceptual one. And the chairman of the SEC gets it,‚Äù he highlighted, predicting that with more regulatory clarity underway, the sector could surge. Despite the lack of regulatory clarity, DeFi apps have significant usage. (‚Ä¶.) With greater clarity, could these numbers rise by 10x? 50x? 100x? As traditional and crypto markets merge, the opportunity is huge.",Crypto News|Bitwise CIO|crypto regulation|DeFi adoption|ETH|Ethereum|ETHUSDT|Matt Hougan|Paul Atkins|SEC Chairman|SEC Project Crypto|Securities and Exchange Commission|Stablecoins|US SEC,EN,0,0,REGULATION|ZRX|MARKET|ETH|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-07 06:00:22

This indicates a remarkably balanced, yet slightly bearish, sentiment among traders overall. It suggests that bulls and bears are nearly equally matched, with a marginal lean towards short positions. However, the picture becomes more nuanced when we look at individual exchange data: Binance: Long 50.35%, Short 49.65% Bybit: Long 49.17%, Short 50.83% Gate.io: Long 49.06%, Short 50.94% These figures highlight interesting divergences. Binance, a dominant player, shows a slight majority of long positions, suggesting its user base is marginally more optimistic about Bitcoin‚Äôs immediate future. In contrast, Bybit and Gate.io exhibit a clearer leaning towards short positions, indicating a more bearish outlook from their respective trader communities. Understanding these differences can provide deeper crypto trading insights . Interpreting Bitcoin Market Sentiment from These Ratios The collective Bitcoin market sentiment , as reflected by these long-short ratios , appears to be at a critical juncture. The near 50/50 split across the total market suggests indecision or a standoff between bullish and bearish forces. A slight majority of short positions could imply caution or anticipation of a minor pullback, especially after recent price movements. For instance, Binance‚Äôs slight long bias might indicate that a significant portion of its traders are either buying dips or expecting a continuation of an upward trend. On the other hand, the more pronounced short bias on Bybit and Gate.io could suggest that traders on these platforms are actively hedging against potential downside or are positioning for a corrective move. This diverse positioning across exchanges underscores the complexity of predicting market moves based on a single metric. Actionable Crypto Trading Insights: How Can You You Use This Data? While futures trading data like long-short ratios provides valuable context, it should never be your sole decision-making tool. Instead, consider it as one piece of a larger puzzle for informed trading. Here are some actionable crypto trading insights : Gauge Overbought/Oversold Conditions: Extremely skewed ratios (e.g., 70%+ long or short) can sometimes signal an impending reversal. A very high long ratio might suggest an overbought market ripe for a correction, and vice versa. Our current data, however, indicates a relatively balanced market. Identify Divergences: Pay attention to discrepancies between overall market ratios and those of individual exchanges. These divergences can highlight where large pockets of sentiment are forming, potentially influencing price action. Confirm Other Indicators: Use long-short ratios to confirm or challenge signals from other technical analysis indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD, support/resistance levels). If your technical analysis suggests a bullish move and the long-short ratio is also leaning long, it strengthens your conviction. Risk Management: A balanced market, as seen today, often implies higher volatility or sideways movement until a clearer sentiment emerges. This knowledge can help you adjust your risk management strategies, perhaps by reducing position sizes or tightening stop-losses. Remember, markets are fluid. These ratios can change rapidly, reflecting shifts in trader psychology and external news events. In conclusion, monitoring BTC perpetual futures long-short ratios offers an unparalleled window into prevailing Bitcoin market sentiment . While the overall market appears finely balanced with a slight bearish tilt, individual exchange data reveals interesting nuances. By integrating these long-short ratios with other analytical tools, traders can refine their strategies and make more informed decisions in the ever-evolving crypto landscape. This crucial futures trading data empowers you to navigate the market with greater confidence. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are BTC perpetual futures? A1: BTC perpetual futures are a type of derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of Bitcoin without an expiration date. Unlike traditional futures, they do not settle physically and can be held indefinitely, mimicking spot price movements. Q2: How are long-short ratios calculated? A2: Long-short ratios are typically calculated by dividing the total number or volume of long positions by the total number or volume of short positions on an exchange or across multiple exchanges. A ratio above 1 indicates more long positions, while below 1 indicates more short positions. Our data presents it as a percentage split. Q3: Do long-short ratios predict price movements? A3: While long-short ratios provide valuable insights into Bitcoin market sentiment and trader positioning, they are not direct predictors of price movements. They are best used as a confluence indicator, helping to confirm or challenge signals from other technical and fundamental analyses. Extreme ratios can sometimes precede reversals. Q4: Which exchanges provide long-short ratio data? A4: Many major cryptocurrency exchanges that offer perpetual futures trading, such as Binance, Bybit, Gate.io, OKX, and others, provide their own long-short ratio data, often accessible through their analytics pages or APIs. Aggregators also compile this data from various sources. Q5: What does a 50/50 long-short ratio mean? A5: A 50/50 (or near 50/50) long-short ratio suggests a very balanced market sentiment, where bullish and bearish traders are almost equally positioned. This can indicate indecision, consolidation, or a period of potential sideways movement before a clearer trend emerges. It highlights a strong contest between buyers and sellers.

49677206,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=407523,1754547130,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/49677206.jpeg,Shiba Inu to Appoint Interim President ‚Äì Here‚Äôs Why That Matters,https://cryptopotato.com/shiba-inu-to-appoint-interim-president-heres-why-that-matters/,"TL;DR Shiba Inu is introducing its first-ever democratic process to appoint an interim president through a multi-phase election involving open nominations, debates, and final voting. Lead developer Shytoshi Kusama announced a shift toward community-led governance, encouraging SHIB whales to run for the position. The Elections Earlier this month, the popular meme coin project Shiba Inu celebrated its fifth birthday. Over the past half a decade, it underwent numerous developments, while Shytoshi Kusama unveiled the next one: the election of an interim president. The lead developer said the appointment of such a figure will happen after ‚Äúfair elections,‚Äù whereas the voting will go through three sessions. ‚ÄúThe first allows for anyone to be nominated, while the top 10 move onto the debate phase. Debates will take place LIVE or recorded on various platforms and times, while a secondary vote to find the top 3 will take place after one week,‚Äù the announcement reads. It is important to mention that anyone can nominate themselves for the position and will be required to create a profile to give the community some info about who they are. The final vote will take place one week after the debates between the three remaining candidates. The appointed president will be responsible for the well-being and future vision of the project and the proper execution of the Shib Paper guidelines. ‚ÄúThey are to implement the first congress (consisting of the four DAO councils), which stands as the inter-branch DAO mentioned in the Shib Paper. Most importantly, they are responsible for the community of millions and the financial responsibility of a 7 billion dollar token,‚Äù Kusama added. According to the developer, the perfect candidate must combine ‚Äútechnological prowess, unwavering dedication, and impeccable vision.‚Äù Last but not least, Kusama recommended that the president be a whale in the SHIB community (an investor who has substantial holdings of the meme coin). ‚ÄúFor this reason, I suggest a multi-vote system for this election where 1 token = 1 vote for any and all of the ecosystem tokens. In this way, whales should hypothetically win, which is aligned as they have the most skin in our success. Moreover, I implore the community to rigorously vet, check, and learn about all candidates,‚Äù they advised. What About Kusama? The lead developer argued that they have been deemed responsible for completing Ryoshi‚Äôs vision. To the uninitiated, Ryoshi is the pseudonymous creator of Shiba Inu who hasn‚Äôt revealed their identity. Kusama said their role now rests with the community, but said they will continue to post details on the election date and other updates. ‚ÄúWe will continue working on innovation, and closely with the Treat Dao and strategies therein, and will continue pursuits outside of SHIB that align with our vision and often contribute to the ecosystem or DAOs. In this way, we continue as valued Shibizens of a system we helped build from nothing,‚Äù the developer concluded.

In a significant development, Bithumb has officially designated Self Chain (SLF) as a closely monitored asset . This move, signaling increased scrutiny, has prompted immediate attention across the market, especially for those holding or trading SLF. Understanding the implications of this Bithumb SLF monitoring is crucial for all investors. What‚Äôs Happening with Self Chain Crypto? Bithumb, a prominent South Korean crypto exchange Bithumb , made its announcement regarding Self Chain Crypto (SLF) on its official website. The core of this designation is a comprehensive review process. Essentially, SLF is now under heightened observation due to specific concerns identified by the exchange. This decision is not arbitrary. Bithumb‚Äôs assessment considered several critical factors: Issuer‚Äôs Social Credibility: A review of the reputation and trustworthiness of the Self Chain project team. Smart Contract Code Disclosure: Examination of how transparently the smart contract code is disclosed on the distributed ledger. Control Over Major Event Functions: Evaluation of the project‚Äôs control mechanisms concerning significant events impacting the asset. These factors collectively indicate areas where Self Chain may need to improve or provide further clarity to maintain its standing on the exchange. Understanding a Closely Monitored Asset Status When a digital asset like SLF is labeled a closely monitored asset , it signals that the exchange has identified potential risks or areas of concern. It‚Äôs a precautionary measure, not an immediate delisting. However, it serves as a strong warning to both the project team and investors. For users, this status often leads to restricted activities. In this specific case, Bithumb has explicitly stated that SLF deposit suspension will commence. This means users will no longer be able to deposit SLF tokens into their Bithumb accounts starting from August 7 at 06:00 UTC. Such designations are common practice among exchanges globally. They aim to protect users and maintain market integrity. Moreover, they encourage projects to address identified issues promptly. How Does Crypto Exchange Bithumb Decide? The decision by crypto exchange Bithumb to place Self Chain under monitoring stems from a rigorous internal review. This review evaluates various aspects of a project‚Äôs health and compliance. The goal is to ensure a secure and trustworthy trading environment for its users. This thorough evaluation process, part of the broader Bithumb SLF monitoring initiative, underscores the exchange‚Äôs commitment to due diligence. It helps to mitigate risks associated with projects that might lack transparency or robust operational controls. Such proactive measures are vital in the fast-evolving crypto landscape, protecting investors from potential pitfalls. The Impact of SLF Deposit Suspension and What‚Äôs Next The immediate and most direct impact of this designation is the SLF deposit suspension . Starting August 7 at 06:00 UTC, users will be unable to transfer Self Chain (SLF) tokens into their Bithumb accounts. While withdrawals and trading might continue for a period, the suspension of deposits is often a precursor to further action if issues are not resolved. The designation as a closely monitored asset places the onus on the Self Chain Crypto project team to address Bithumb‚Äôs concerns. This typically involves improving transparency, enhancing communication, and potentially making technical adjustments to their smart contracts or operational procedures. The future status of Self Chain on Bithumb will depend on the project‚Äôs ability to satisfy the exchange‚Äôs requirements. If the issues remain unaddressed, further restrictions or even delisting could occur. Conversely, successful resolution could lead to the removal of the monitoring status. Investors should exercise caution and conduct their own due diligence. This latest development from crypto exchange Bithumb regarding Bithumb SLF monitoring serves as a reminder of the dynamic and regulated nature of the cryptocurrency market. Exchanges actively work to safeguard their users and maintain a healthy trading environment. For Self Chain, this is a critical juncture that demands a proactive response to ensure its continued presence on one of South Korea‚Äôs leading platforms. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does ‚Äúclosely monitored asset‚Äù mean for Self Chain (SLF)? A1: It means Bithumb has identified potential risks or concerns with Self Chain (SLF) and is subjecting it to heightened scrutiny. It‚Äôs a warning sign, not an immediate delisting, but indicates the need for the project to address identified issues. Q2: Why did Bithumb designate SLF as a closely monitored asset? A2: Bithumb‚Äôs decision was based on a comprehensive review of factors including the issuer‚Äôs social credibility, the disclosure status of smart contract code, and control over functions related to major events. Q3: When will SLF deposit suspension take effect on Bithumb? A3: SLF deposits will be suspended starting on August 7 at 06:00 UTC. Q4: Can I still trade or withdraw Self Chain (SLF) on Bithumb? A4: The announcement specifically mentions deposit suspension. While trading and withdrawals are not immediately halted, it is crucial to monitor Bithumb‚Äôs official announcements for any further updates on trading or withdrawal status. Q5: What should SLF holders do now? A5: SLF holders should stay informed by following Bithumb‚Äôs official announcements and the Self Chain project‚Äôs updates. Consider the implications of the deposit suspension and assess your holdings based on your risk tolerance. Share Your Thoughts on This Development!

While its long-term fundamentals remain strong, the current market tells a different story. After weeks of elevated price action, SOL has entered a cooling phase, with profit-taking dominating the charts. Institutional outflows have remained minor, but they signal a shift‚Äîespecially when capital begins flowing elsewhere. The good news? Solana‚Äôs $8.8 million in net inflows last week suggests some institutions are still holding faith. Yet among traders and crypto strategists, many now see the $136‚Äì$148 range as a short-term accumulation zone rather than a launchpad. Momentum has cooled, and attention is moving fast‚Äîto assets perceived as having more upside in this phase of the market. Among the rotating favorites? XRP and a fast-rising altcoin that‚Äôs generating increasing social chatter and early whale activity: MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP Strengthens Amid Rotation XRP is one of the primary beneficiaries of this SOL outflow trend. As Solana pauses, XRP has surged back into headlines thanks to three powerful catalysts: whale accumulation, ETF optimism, and increasing regulatory clarity. Whale wallets holding between 10 million and 100 million XRP have absorbed over 464 billion tokens in the past two months. That‚Äôs nearly 10% of the circulating supply, pointing to a clear long-term bet on XRP‚Äôs resurgence. Add to that the approval of the ProShares Ultra XRP ETF and more than 10 pending spot ETF applications under SEC review, and the roadmap for XRP looks increasingly bullish. If prices hold above the $2.65 support, analysts say a push toward $4‚Äì$5 is well within reach before year-end. New Capital Eyes Emerging Alts There has been a noticeable trend of Solana capital outflow towards MAGACOIN FINANCE , and traders eye 21,600% gains in the next bull cycle. That‚Äôs the growing sentiment as early investors begin moving out of slower-moving Layer 1s and toward community-powered, scarcity-based altcoins. MAGACOIN FINANCE is attracting both retail attention and early institutional curiosity, thanks to a fixed token supply and a surge in on-chain inflows. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart isn‚Äôt just its growth potential‚Äîit‚Äôs the narrative. A mix of decentralized ownership, U.S. political cycle alignment, and community-driven development has given it serious memetic strength. Many compare its early-stage vibes to Ethereum in 2018 or XRP in 2021. With speculative capital now circling the project, some projections place its breakout potential well into the 21,000%+ ROI territory if broader markets rally. Altcoin Rotation Shows No Signs of Slowing While Solana‚Äôs fundamentals remain intact‚Äîdriven by future network upgrades and long-term adoption‚Äîshort-term attention is elsewhere. Altcoin rotations are a regular feature of every crypto bull cycle, and they often determine which projects dominate headlines and capital inflows. Right now, XRP is riding ETF momentum, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining traction as a high-upside wildcard for 2025. Traders know the windows for entry are tight‚Äîand those who rotate early often benefit the most.

Recently, a pivotal development has reshaped the landscape for South Korean crypto exchanges , highlighting the nation‚Äôs stringent approach to digital asset governance. The Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) has initiated decisive action against platforms operating outside established legal frameworks. This move sends an unequivocal message about the critical importance of regulatory compliance in the crypto space. What Prompted the Crackdown on Unregistered Crypto Exchanges? South Korea‚Äôs Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), operating under the Financial Services Commission (FSC), recently identified two specific unregistered crypto exchanges : KCEX and QXALX. These platforms were found to be operating illegally within the country, failing to adhere to mandatory registration requirements. The FIU swiftly reported these non-compliant entities to law enforcement, signaling a zero-tolerance policy for illicit operations. This action underscores the regulator‚Äôs unwavering commitment to enforcing robust compliance rules across all crypto-related businesses. Furthermore, the FIU announced plans to block access to the websites and mobile applications of KCEX and QXALX within South Korea. This proactive measure effectively prevents local users from engaging with these non-compliant services, safeguarding them from potential risks associated with unregistered crypto exchanges . Why is Crypto Regulation in South Korea So Vital? South Korea has consistently pursued a comprehensive and robust regulatory framework for its digital asset market. The nation‚Äôs approach to crypto regulation South Korea is widely regarded as one of the most stringent globally. This strictness is a direct response to past incidents involving illicit financial activities and a strategic effort to cultivate a secure and transparent digital asset environment. The FIU‚Äôs recent actions serve as a powerful deterrent. They emphatically remind both domestic and overseas crypto exchanges that operating without proper registration carries severe legal and operational consequences. It reinforces the principle that simply being based outside South Korea does not exempt an exchange from adhering to local laws when serving Korean citizens or residents. Key aspects of South Korea‚Äôs regulatory stance include: Investor Protection: Safeguarding individuals from scams, fraud, and financial losses. Anti-Money Laundering (AML): Preventing the use of cryptocurrencies for illegal financing. Market Stability: Ensuring orderly and fair market operations within the realm of South Korean crypto exchanges . What Are the Risks of Using Unregistered Overseas Crypto Exchanges? For users in South Korea, this development brings into sharp focus the critical importance of verifying the registration status of any platform they utilize. Engaging with unregistered overseas crypto exchanges can expose individuals to a multitude of significant risks. These include: Loss of Funds: No legal recourse if the platform collapses or absconds with assets. Lack of Consumer Protection: Absence of regulatory oversight means no avenues for dispute resolution or compensation. Involvement in Illegal Activities: Unwittingly participating in money laundering or other illicit financial schemes. Data Security Risks: Non-compliant exchanges may have weaker cybersecurity protocols, exposing personal data. Users are strongly advised to prioritize platforms that are fully compliant with local regulations. This diligence ensures their investments receive the protection afforded by law. The FIU‚Äôs move aims to shield the public from fraudulent schemes and unregulated operations, thereby making the digital asset space considerably safer for everyone. How Does the Financial Intelligence Unit Bolster Market Integrity? The Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) is a cornerstone in the fight against financial crimes, including money laundering and terrorist financing. By meticulously identifying and reporting non-compliant entities, the FIU actively protects both the broader financial system and individual investors. This proactive enforcement mechanism ensures that only legitimate and transparent entities are permitted to operate within the South Korean market. It establishes a robust precedent for other jurisdictions grappling with similar challenges posed by cross-border crypto operations. The continuous vigilance and decisive actions of the Financial Intelligence Unit are absolutely vital for maintaining integrity and trust in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency landscape, especially concerning South Korean crypto exchanges . In summary, South Korea‚Äôs latest regulatory action against unregistered overseas crypto exchanges sends a clear, powerful message: compliance is not merely an option, but a non-negotiable prerequisite. This significant move reinforces the nation‚Äôs unwavering commitment to fostering a secure, transparent, and regulated environment for digital assets. Moreover, it serves as a crucial reminder for crypto users worldwide to exercise due diligence and always prioritize regulated platforms to safeguard their valuable investments. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) and its role in crypto regulation? The FIU is a government agency under South Korea‚Äôs Financial Services Commission (FSC) responsible for combating money laundering and terrorist financing. In crypto, its role involves identifying and reporting illegal operations by unregistered crypto exchanges to ensure market integrity and investor protection. 2. Which specific exchanges were reported by the FIU in South Korea? The Financial Intelligence Unit reported two specific unregistered crypto exchanges : KCEX and QXALX. These platforms were identified for operating illegally within South Korea without proper registration. 3. Why are unregistered crypto exchanges considered risky for users? Using unregistered crypto exchanges carries significant risks, including potential loss of funds due to lack of legal recourse, absence of consumer protection, vulnerability to data breaches, and the risk of unwittingly participating in illicit financial activities.

Users should check the official website of South Korea‚Äôs Financial Services Commission (FSC) or the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) for a list of registered and licensed virtual asset service providers (VASPs). This ensures they are using compliant South Korean crypto exchanges . 5. What are the consequences for unregistered overseas crypto exchanges operating in South Korea?

Bets are already being placed on what will be the outcome of the meeting and subsequent announcement, with the majority currently leaning toward a possible rate cut, something that President Donald Trump has been vying for over the last few months. September FOMC Meeting Votes Heat Up The last FOMC meeting had seen the start of a positive trend when the Fed had decided not to hike interest rates . There had been no cuts in the rates on July 30, but the decision to keep rates at their current level enabled the markets to stay quite steady, triggering modest volatility in risk markets such as Bitcoin and crypto. The next FOMC meeting is now set for September 17 and is already drawing bets from market stakeholders. According to the FedWatch Tool on the CME Group website, the majority believe that the Fed will actually bend and decide to cut interest rates during this meeting. It shows that there is a 92.2% probability that the Fed will decide to actually cut rates, a move that could see interest rates crash toward 4%. There is a 7.8% probability that the Fed will decide to actually leave interest rates unchanged again, while there is a 0% chance that there will be a hike in the rates. Currently, the interest rates are still sitting at 4.25%-4.5%, and while this is not the highest they have been, it remains quite high for risk markets. This has led to lower participation from investors as they take a more conservative stance toward their investments. What A Cut Means For Bitcoin And Crypto Historically, a cut in interest rates is bullish for risk assets, and the likes of Bitcoin and the crypto market tend to benefit greatly from this. This is because an announcement of rate cuts triggers increased volatility in the market, and the new liquidity being pumped into the ecosystem as a result of the positive news leads to price hikes in Bitcoin and the crypto market. One thing that could determine how high the Bitcoin and crypto market could rise in response is how much the Fed decides to cut rates. An example of a dramatic rate cut that led to a massive rally was back during the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020 , when the Fed had cut rates from 1.58% to 0.05%. What followed was the most explosive bull market in the history of Bitcoin and crypto so far. Given this, a Fed rate cut would be very bullish for the Bitcoin price. In fact, depending on how much the rates are cut, the response could trigger massive volatility and ultimately lead to the digital asset reaching new all-time highs .",Crypto News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|crypto|Crypto Market|crypto news|Fed|Fed news|FOMC|FOMC news|rate cuts,EN,0,0,MACROECONOMICS|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-07 07:00:02

He recognizes that such a valuation would require an increase of more than 33,000% from current levels, but is willing to wait 10 years for XRP to achieve that growth. Massive Gains But An Extended Timeline Currently priced near $3, XRP would need to rise by approximately 33,233% to hit the $1,000 mark . Pantoja believes that while this figure is extreme, it is not impossible over a long enough time frame. He points to Bitcoin‚Äôs growth as a historical comparison, noting that it took nearly eight years for BTC to remain consistently above $1,000. He believes XRP‚Äôs growth potential has been limited by external factors, especially regulatory challenges, but could improve significantly in the years ahead, and he added, ‚ÄúA 33,233% return?

Critics like Quinten Francois have criticized the $1,000 prediction as unrealistic, and many detractors point out that with over 59 billion XRP in circulation, a $1,000 price would result in a market capitalization of approximately $59 trillion. This would exceed the combined value of major global assets, including gold and the top technology companies. However, some, including EasyA founder Dom Kwok, believe in the $1,000 target and argue that critics don‚Äôt account for future shifts in global finance, such as asset tokenization and increased use of digital currencies. CryptoGuard‚Äôs Matthew Brienen also previously projected that XRP could reach $1,000 by 2035 . For investors like Pantoja, the focus is on XRP‚Äôs role in future financial systems.

This pioneering move aims to harness an often-overlooked resource: stranded natural gas . Imagine transforming what was once a waste product into valuable digital assets. This approach promises a new frontier for both energy production and cryptocurrency, highlighting a remarkable commitment to sustainability and economic efficiency. Why Are Oil & Gas Firms Embracing Bitcoin Mining? Traditionally, extracting natural gas sometimes leaves behind ‚Äústranded‚Äù pockets. These are too small or remote to connect to existing pipelines, making them uneconomical to bring to market. Consequently, companies often burn off this excess gas, a process known as flaring, which releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. However, a clever solution has emerged. Instead of flaring, these oil and gas firms can convert the stranded natural gas into electricity directly on-site. This power then fuels specialized computers for Bitcoin mining . It‚Äôs a win-win scenario: Environmental Benefit: Reduces gas flaring and associated emissions. Economic Opportunity: Turns a waste product into a revenue stream. Union Jack Oil views this as a strategic part of their Bitcoin treasury strategy. Meanwhile, Reabold Resources believes that mining Bitcoin directly is even more profitable than simply purchasing the cryptocurrency outright. The Astonishing Promise of Sustainable Bitcoin This innovative approach offers significant advantages, particularly in the realm of environmental responsibility. By utilizing otherwise wasted energy, these companies contribute to a more sustainable Bitcoin ecosystem. It addresses a common criticism leveled against cryptocurrency mining: its energy consumption. Here‚Äôs how it makes a difference: Reduced Waste: Converts a flared resource into productive energy. Lower Carbon Footprint: Compared to using grid electricity for mining, this method repurposes existing emissions. Enhanced Efficiency: Maximizes the value extracted from every barrel and cubic foot of gas. This method of Bitcoin mining exemplifies how industries can adapt to create more environmentally friendly practices while pursuing new profit avenues. It showcases a forward-thinking approach to energy management. How Does This Energy Innovation Work in Practice? The process is surprisingly straightforward. At locations like West Newton, where Union Jack Oil and Reabold Resources operate, specialized generators convert the stranded natural gas into electricity. This electricity then powers containers filled with Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) miners ‚Äì the powerful computers designed specifically for Bitcoin mining . This on-site energy conversion and consumption is a brilliant example of energy innovation . It eliminates the need for expensive pipeline infrastructure and reduces transmission losses. Furthermore, it provides a stable, dedicated power source for the mining operations, which is crucial for consistent profitability in the volatile crypto market. The scalability of these modular mining units also allows for flexible deployment based on gas availability. What Are the Potential Hurdles for Oil and Gas Firms? While the prospects are bright, adopting Bitcoin mining presents certain challenges for traditional oil and gas firms . They must navigate the complexities of both the energy sector and the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency landscape. Key considerations include: Regulatory Landscape: Cryptocurrency regulations vary globally and can change quickly, impacting operations. Market Volatility: Bitcoin‚Äôs price fluctuations directly affect mining profitability. Technical Expertise: Integrating and managing advanced mining hardware requires specialized IT and cybersecurity knowledge. Public Perception: Communicating the environmental benefits effectively is crucial to counter negative stereotypes about crypto‚Äôs energy use. Despite these challenges, the proactive stance of companies like Union Jack Oil and Reabold Resources highlights a commitment to overcoming obstacles through strategic energy innovation . The move by British oil and gas firms into Bitcoin mining using stranded natural gas represents a truly transformative development. It demonstrates how traditional industries can embrace cutting-edge technology to achieve both economic gains and environmental sustainability. This synergy between energy production and digital currency is not just a passing trend; it is a significant step towards a more efficient and sustainable Bitcoin ecosystem. By converting waste into wealth, these companies are setting a powerful precedent for future energy innovation across the globe. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is ‚Äòstranded natural gas‚Äô? A1: Stranded natural gas refers to pockets of natural gas that are too small or geographically isolated to be economically transported to market via pipelines. Historically, it was often flared, meaning burned off. Q2: How does mining Bitcoin with stranded natural gas benefit the environment? A2: This method significantly reduces the practice of gas flaring, which releases greenhouse gases directly into the atmosphere. By using the gas for electricity to power Bitcoin mining , companies convert a waste product into productive energy, contributing to a more sustainable Bitcoin approach. Q3: Are other oil and gas firms exploring similar initiatives? A3: Yes, several oil and gas firms globally are exploring or already implementing similar strategies to monetize stranded natural gas through Bitcoin mining, seeing it as a viable form of energy innovation . Q4: Is this method more profitable than buying Bitcoin directly? A4: For companies with access to otherwise wasted energy resources, mining can be more profitable than direct purchases. This is because they effectively reduce their energy costs to near zero for the mining operation, maximizing their return on investment.

A prominent crypto analyst has identified a significant technical pattern on the ETH/USDT daily chart, pointing towards a substantial upward movement. This could mean a remarkable shift in the Ethereum price trajectory, potentially leading to new highs. Understanding the Bull Pennant Pattern and ETH Breakout Potential What exactly is this bullish signal that has analysts buzzing? According to Watcher Guru, a clear bullish pennant pattern has emerged on the ETH/USDT daily chart. This formation is a strong indicator of potential upward momentum for the Ethereum price . Crypto analyst Titan of Crypto, a respected voice in the space, highlighted this pattern. He suggests that this specific formation could propel Ethereum towards an ambitious $5K target . But what does a bull pennant truly represent? It is a continuation pattern that typically forms after a sharp, significant price rise. This initial surge is then followed by a period of consolidation, where the price trades within a narrowing range, forming a triangular shape. This consolidation often occurs near the highs of the initial rally. The crucial aspect of a bull pennant is its implication: it often precedes another strong rally upon a confirmed breakout. For Ethereum, this suggests that the current consolidation phase might just be a brief pause before its next major leg up. Why Does This Crypto Analysis Matter for Investors? For anyone following the crypto market, understanding such technical patterns is vital. This specific crypto analysis provides a roadmap for potential future price action. A bull pennant is generally considered a reliable pattern by technical traders. Here‚Äôs why this pattern is so significant for the Ethereum price : Continuation Signal: It indicates that the previous uptrend is likely to continue, rather than reverse. Consolidation Before Rally: If the bull pennant holds, this phase allows for profit-taking and new buyers to enter, building energy for the next move. Clear Target: Analysts can often project a price target based on the initial flagpole‚Äôs height, as Titan of Crypto has done with the $5K target . However, it is always important to remember that technical analysis is not foolproof. Market conditions can change rapidly, and unexpected events can influence price movements. Therefore, while this pattern is promising, investors should also consider broader market sentiment and fundamental factors. Navigating the Path to the $5K Target: What to Watch For If the ETH breakout materializes as predicted, what should investors look for? The key confirmation for a bull pennant is a decisive break above the upper trendline of the pennant, accompanied by strong trading volume. This surge in volume often validates the breakout and signals strong buying interest. For those considering their next moves, here are some actionable insights: Monitor Volume: A breakout on low volume might be a false signal. Look for a significant increase in trading activity. Confirmation: Wait for the price to sustain above the breakout level for a period (e.g., a daily close above the trendline). Risk Management: Even with bullish patterns, setting stop-loss orders is a prudent strategy to manage potential downside risks. The journey to the $5K target , if it occurs, will likely involve volatility. Ethereum, like all cryptocurrencies, is subject to market fluctuations. Therefore, a balanced approach combining technical insights with a thorough understanding of market dynamics is essential. Concluding Thoughts on Ethereum‚Äôs Potential Surge The formation of a bullish pennant on the Ethereum chart, as highlighted by expert crypto analysis , presents an exciting prospect for investors. The potential ETH breakout towards a $5K target is a significant development that could mark a new chapter for the second-largest cryptocurrency. While technical patterns offer valuable insights, it is crucial to combine them with careful consideration of market risks and broader economic factors. Staying informed and exercising caution are always key in the dynamic world of crypto. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a bull pennant pattern in crypto analysis? A bull pennant is a bullish continuation pattern that forms after a sharp price increase, followed by a brief period of consolidation in a triangular shape. It suggests that the prior uptrend will resume. Q2: Who is Titan of Crypto? Titan of Crypto is a crypto analyst known for their technical analysis and market insights, often shared on platforms like X (formerly Twitter). Q3: What does the $5K target for Ethereum mean? The $5K target is a projected price level that the Ethereum price could reach if the identified bull pennant pattern successfully breaks out and its implied move completes. Q4: How reliable are technical analysis patterns like the bull pennant? Technical analysis patterns like the bull pennant are widely used by traders and can be reliable indicators of future price movements. However, they are not guaranteed and should be used in conjunction with other forms of analysis and risk management. Q5: What factors could prevent Ethereum from reaching the $5K target? Factors such as a sudden market downturn, unexpected regulatory changes, major economic shifts, or a failure of the pattern to break out convincingly could prevent Ethereum from reaching the $5K target.

The company CFO Kwon Tae-hoon said at KakaoBank‚Äôs first-half 2025 earnings call on Tuesday that the bank is ‚Äúreviewing various methods such as issuance and custody related to the digital asset ecosystem.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe plan to engage actively in line with market changes,‚Äù Kwon noted, per a ZDNet Korea report on Wednesday . Further, Kakao Group, the parent IT firm, is creating a stablecoin task force and holding weekly discussions to consolidate strategy. CEOs Chung Shin-ah (Kakao), Shin Won-keun (KakaoPay), and Yoon Ho-young (KakaoBank) will be leading the initiative. Additionally, Kwon emphasised that KakaoBank has the risk management and technical expertise, noting the firm had participated in both phases now-cancelled Bank of Korea CBDC pilot.

Vet issued a detailed response that laid out five core reasons why, in his view, Long‚Äôs characterizations were incorrect or based on fundamental misunderstandings of the XRP ecosystem. She has no clue what she is talking about, but she talks with such confidence about it. 1) Ripple never did an ICO. XRP was worth nothing when the XRP Ledger started and all 100B put into the genesis account. 2) The XRP Ledger is decentralized. Either it's ignorance or lack of‚Ä¶ https://t.co/yQNtGe81XL ‚Äî Vet (@Vet_X0) August 6, 2025 Ripple Never Conducted an ICO VET‚Äôs first point addressed the claim that Ripple‚Äôs early XRP distribution resembled an exit scam due to the amount of money raised upfront. He asserted that Ripple never held an initial coin offering (ICO) and emphasized that XRP had no market value at the time the XRP Ledger launched. According to VET, all 100 billion XRP were placed in a genesis account, not distributed in exchange for investor funds. He maintained that this fundamental distinction sets Ripple apart from other projects that raised capital through public sales, such as Ethereum. The XRP Ledger Is Decentralized Vet‚Äôs second reason focused on Long‚Äôs description of the XRP Ledger as a centralized network. He rejected this outright, stating that such claims reflect either ignorance or a lack of understanding. Vet explained that the XRP Ledger is open and permissionless, allowing anyone to run a node , join the network, or even fork its codebase. He added that there are over 1,000 active nodes and more than 100 validators operated by individuals and businesses worldwide. In his view, Long‚Äôs continued framing of the network as centralized ignores verifiable facts and the presence of numerous independent participants. Ethereum‚Äôs ICO Undermines the Comparison In his third argument, Vet questioned Long‚Äôs choice to elevate Ethereum as a more trustworthy platform. He pointed out that Ethereum did conduct an ICO and that early investors received ETH in exchange for Bitcoin. According to Vet, if Long is concerned about networks that raised money upfront, then Ethereum should not be held up as the ideal. He contrasted this with XRP‚Äôs distribution, which, he reiterated, involved no ICO, further undermining the basis of her criticism. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Ripple‚Äôs Use of XRPL Refutes Claims of Abandonment Vet‚Äôs fourth point challenged Long‚Äôs interpretation that Ripple had pivoted away from the XRP Ledger. He clarified that Ripple Payments actively runs on the XRP Ledger and that Ripple‚Äôs new stablecoin, RLUSD , is being issued on the same network. Contrary to Long‚Äôs suggestion that Ripple had moved on due to limited adoption, Vet argued that these developments illustrate a continued commitment to building on XRPL as the core infrastructure for the company‚Äôs financial products. XRPL Has Shown Ongoing Progress and Adoption The fifth and final reason Vet offered involved the continued evolution of the XRP Ledger. He stated that the network has made clear progress, with growing business use cases, increasing developer activity, and new functionalities implemented through protocol amendments. Vet also emphasized that XRPL is home to a deeply liquid decentralized exchange (DEX) and was the first tokenization platform to launch. In his view, describing the network as stagnant or ineffective does not align with the evidence of continued development and institutional relevance. While Caitlin Long‚Äôs comments questioned XRP‚Äôs design, adoption, and future role in tokenization, Vet‚Äôs five-point rebuttal highlighted what he views as a series of misconceptions. His response emphasized XRP‚Äôs original distribution model, decentralization, Ripple‚Äôs ongoing use of the network, and XRPL‚Äôs continuing development as evidence that Long‚Äôs criticisms were misplaced.

TIA‚Äôs price is attempting to hold above $1.6 as buyers triggered minor demand around recent dips. Will the TIA price reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment and buying demand, we might see TIA‚Äôs price touching the $100 milestone in the coming years. According to our prediction, the TIA price might hit the $100 mark in 2030. Will the TIA price reach $1,000? If the altcoin market remains robust in the coming years and Celestia develops more user-friendly utilities, its price might surpass $1K. Is TIA a good long-term investment? Yes, TIA is a good long-term investment option. As buyers‚Äô interest grows and the network expands, we might see profitable returns.

Based on a deep technical analysis of past TIA price data, the price of Celestia is predicted to reach a minimum level of $1, a potential maximum of $21.22, and an average trading price of $18.47 in 2025.

Key Takeaways: US spot Bitcoin ETFs rebounded with $91.5M in net inflows, breaking a four-day outflow streak. BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT led the recovery, while ARK & 21Shares‚Äô ARKB was the only major fund with outflows. Analysts suggest recent selloffs were fear-driven, not fundamental, as Ethereum ETFs also returned to net inflows. BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT led the rebound with $42 million in inflows, followed by $26.35 million into Bitwise‚Äôs BITB. Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC also turned positive, bringing in $14.5 million. Funds from Fidelity and VanEck posted smaller gains, while ARK & 21Shares‚Äô ARKB was the only major fund to register outflows, shedding $5.37 million. Bitcoin ETFs Rebound After $1.45B Outflow Amid Market Jitters The return to inflows follows a sharp $1.45 billion exodus over the previous four trading sessions, driven by uncertainty in macroeconomic indicators and a pullback in risk appetite. As reported, the crypto ETF market saw a sharp selloff , with over $333 million pulled from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs and $465 million from Ethereum ETFs on Tuesday. BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT and ETHA accounted for more than 84% of these outflows, marking a major reversal after weeks of consistent inflows. Other firms like Fidelity and Grayscale also faced significant redemptions, stoking fears that the bull market may have peaked. Despite market panic, some investors argue the selloff is emotionally driven. Crypto investor Ted Pillows called it ‚ÄúPTSD from 2017 and 2021,‚Äù noting the 60% retail investor presence likely triggered profit-taking rather than a strategic exit. Ethereum ETFs saw their largest daily outflow to date, but analysts argue fundamentals remain intact. People are scared by the $ETH ETF outflows over the past two days.

As of 12:05 a.m. Thursday, the asset is up 0.91% in the past 24 hours to $114,551, according to The Block‚Äôs price tracker. Ethereum-based ETFs also posted positive momentum, with $35.12 million in net inflows on Wednesday. BlackRock‚Äôs ETHA brought in $33.39 million, while Grayscale‚Äôs ETHE added $10 million. Grayscale‚Äôs Mini Ethereum Trust recorded $8.67 million in outflows. Michigan State Pension Triples Bitcoin ETF Holdings As reported, the State of Michigan Retirement System has sharply increased its exposure to Bitcoin , tripling its holdings in the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF to 300,000 shares, valued at $11.4 million in Q2. As of March 31, the $19.3 billion pension fund held 100,000 shares. Alongside Bitcoin, Michigan also holds a steady Ethereum allocation through 460,000 shares of the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), currently valued at around $13.6 million, a position it has maintained since September 2024. The move places Michigan among a growing cohort of U.S. state pension funds increasing exposure to crypto-linked assets. The State of Wisconsin Investment Board, for instance, now holds over 6 million shares of BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), worth approximately $387.3 million. Meanwhile, Bloomberg‚Äôs senior ETF analysts have assigned a 95% chance that the SEC will approve spot ETFs for Solana, XRP, and Litecoin this year, raising their previous odds from 90% amid growing optimism for institutional crypto products.

As a proud sponsor of the Business Networking Zone, HTX showcased its forward-looking global strategy and reaffirmed its position as a key influencer in the Web3 industry. The Rise of Stablecoins: From Crypto Instruments to Global Financial Infrastructure During a key panel discussion titled ‚ÄúStablecoin ‚Äì The Most Viable Use Case for Crypto Adoption,‚Äù Alec Goh, Head of HTX Ventures, was a featured panelist. Alec highlighted the rapid evolution of stablecoins, noting their market capitalization has surged to over $250 billion ‚Äî an impressive 60% increase this year. Driven by growing regulatory clarity in countries like the U.S. and active participation from traditional institutions, stablecoins are transcending their role as crypto-native tools to become core components of global financial infrastructure. This marks the early stages of their mainstream adoption. He further explained that in key sectors like on-chain credit, Real World Assets (RWA), and cross-border trade, stablecoins serve as the fundamental layer for value settlement and liquidity within digital financial infrastructure. ‚ÄúThe future isn‚Äôt a binary choice between centralized and decentralized systems, but a blend of compliance and composability,‚Äù Alec said. ‚ÄúLegal frameworks and on-chain technology will evolve together, enabling global scalability while preserving crypto‚Äôs core principles. Ultimately, whether a system is centralized or decentralized matters less than its ability to meet user needs. If decentralized transactions continue to deliver greater value, the market will naturally gravitate toward them.‚Äù ‚ÄúWeb3 Future Night‚Äù Ignites Passion and Drives Web3 Growth A major highlight of Vietnam Blockchain Week was the exclusive ‚ÄúWeb3 Future Night‚Äù cocktail party, presented by¬†HTX and hosted by ChainCatcher. The party brought together a high-profile crowd, including top local project teams, leading investors, influential KOLs, and core community members. Industry-leading partners, including SoSoValue, Bifrost, TRADOOR, TRON , SunPump, and RootData, actively participated, creating a premier networking opportunity. Through this event, HTX strengthened its partnership with the Vietnamese crypto community and helped drive the ongoing development and prosperity of the global Web3 ecosystem. Justin Sun Becomes Youngest Chinese Commercial Astronaut During the Vietnam Blockchain Week, Justin Sun, Advisor to HTX, made history by successfully completing a suborbital flight aboard Blue Origin‚Äôs New Shepard spacecraft. The approximately 10-minute mission crossed the K√°rm√°n line, offering a zero-gravity experience before safely returning to the landing site in Texas. With this feat, he became the youngest Chinese commercial astronaut in history. Following his historic journey, Justin said in an interview, ‚ÄúThis was my first commitment and first step toward space, and there will be more to come in the future.‚Äù His achievement reflects not only his spirit of exploration but also HTX‚Äôs commitment, as a leading player in the global Web3 space, to continually push boundaries and explore new possibilities. HTX made a strong impression at GM Vietnam 2025, reinforcing its position as a leader in the global Web3 space. The platform set the industry‚Äôs course with insightful analysis of stablecoin trends and sparked a new wave of collaboration through its ‚ÄúWeb3 Future Night‚Äù event.

Over the past 40 days, Bitcoin Short-Term Holders have made a remarkable move, accumulating a staggering 178,000 BTC, valued at an impressive $20 billion. This substantial influx of capital into Bitcoin, as highlighted by CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler Jr., indicates a heightened level of activity among a specific group of investors. Understanding this trend is crucial for anyone following the dynamic Bitcoin market . Who Are Bitcoin Short-Term Holders and Why Is Their BTC Accumulation Important? In the world of Bitcoin, investors are often categorized by how long they hold their assets. Bitcoin Short-Term Holders are typically defined as entities that have held their BTC for less than 155 days. Unlike long-term holders who might be less reactive to immediate market fluctuations, short-term holders are often more sensitive to current market conditions and price movements. Market Responsiveness: Their quick entry and exit patterns can significantly influence short-term price dynamics. Indicator of Confidence: A large wave of BTC Accumulation from this group often suggests growing confidence in Bitcoin‚Äôs near-term prospects. They are buying now, anticipating future gains. Liquidity Impact: Their buying activity removes available supply from exchanges, potentially contributing to upward price pressure. This recent $20 billion accumulation isn‚Äôt just a number; it reflects a strategic positioning by a large segment of active investors. They are actively betting on Bitcoin‚Äôs immediate future. What Does This Massive Influx Mean for Crypto Market Trends? The actions of Bitcoin Short-Term Holders serve as a powerful barometer for broader Crypto Market Trends . When such a substantial amount of capital flows into Bitcoin from this cohort, it typically signals a few key things: Increased Demand: The immediate effect is a surge in demand for Bitcoin. This can absorb selling pressure and potentially push prices higher. Positive Sentiment Shift: It suggests a growing bullish sentiment among a critical segment of the market. This optimism can be contagious, encouraging other investors to enter or increase their positions. Potential for Volatility: While accumulation is positive, the nature of short-term holders means they might also be quicker to sell if conditions change. This could lead to increased volatility in Bitcoin Price Action . This recent activity could be a precursor to more significant movements in the overall crypto market, as Bitcoin often leads the charge for altcoins. How Does This Accumulation Impact Bitcoin Price Action and Investor Sentiment? The direct impact on Bitcoin Price Action from this scale of accumulation is substantial. When demand outstrips supply, prices tend to rise. The sustained buying pressure from Bitcoin Short-Term Holders over 40 days suggests a strong underlying bid for BTC, preventing significant pullbacks and laying the groundwork for potential rallies. Furthermore, this trend deeply influences Investor Sentiment . When prominent analysts like Axel Adler Jr. highlight such significant on-chain data, it validates the belief among many that Bitcoin is in a strong accumulation phase. This can: Boost Confidence: Reinforce the conviction of existing holders. Attract New Capital: Draw in new retail and institutional investors who see the momentum building. Create a ‚ÄúFear of Missing Out‚Äù (FOMO): Encourage those on the sidelines to jump in, further fueling the buying pressure. However, investors should also be aware that short-term holders can be quick to take profits, so monitoring future trends will be key. Actionable Insights for Navigating Current Bitcoin Market Trends For those looking to understand or participate in the current Bitcoin market , here are some actionable insights: Monitor On-Chain Data: Keep an eye on metrics like short-term holder accumulation, exchange inflows/outflows, and whale activity. These provide valuable insights into market dynamics. Understand Risk: While accumulation is bullish, short-term price movements can be volatile. Always assess your risk tolerance before making investment decisions. Stay Informed: Follow reputable analysts and news sources to stay updated on key developments influencing Bitcoin Price Action and overall Crypto Market Trends . This period of significant accumulation by short-term holders underscores Bitcoin‚Äôs continued appeal and its role as a key asset in the digital economy. In conclusion, the substantial $20 billion BTC Accumulation by Bitcoin Short-Term Holders over the past 40 days is a powerful indicator of robust demand and strengthening Investor Sentiment . This trend, highlighted by CryptoQuant, suggests a bullish outlook for Bitcoin Price Action in the near term and reinforces the dynamic nature of Crypto Market Trends . While short-term holders can be volatile, their current buying spree paints a picture of growing confidence and a potentially exciting period ahead for the leading cryptocurrency.

With a PEPE price today of $0.00001043 and a 2.96% day gain, everyone is paying attention. But as exciting as the meme coin fever has been, others are starting to look for projects with some real use. Enter Remittix (RTX) ‚Äî a cross-border DeFi project looking to bring crypto into actual payments. Meme Coin Frenzy Slows as Utility Coins Take Center Stage Therefore, Pepe Coin is a demonstration of just how much influence online communities can have in propelling token value. Volatility remains an issue, however. While PEPE is embracing short-term profits, trading volume is down over 18% at $503 million; this is not a healthy indicator, as it indicates that some traders are taking their profit or have already started looking for newer things. With a market cap for the Pepe Coin at $4.39 billion, it has become one of the top-performing meme tokens. But in contrast to utility projects, it offers very little beyond speculative trading. This is why many are now focusing on more practical, infrastructure-based tokens. From Memes to Meaning: Why Traders Are Turning to Alternatives As decentralized exchanges grow and crypto staking comes into the mainstream, the market gradually shifts towards crypto with actual utility. Traders no longer wish to hold coins for the hype. They require tokens that solve real problems ‚Äî most importantly in areas such as global payments, low gas fee crypto, and real-time settlements. This is driving interest towards cross-chain DeFi projects like Remittix, which offers functionality much more than the meme-led rallies seen with assets like PEPE. The crypto community is starting to appreciate early-stage crypto investment opportunities that have something to do with infrastructure ‚Äî and not just internet memes. Remittix: The Feature-Rich Alternative Traders Are Favorable Towards Remittix (RTX) is among the hottest emerging crypto projects this year. The platform allows for the direct sending of crypto to bank accounts in more than 30 nations, bypassing the lengthy waits and exorbitant fees of centralized exchanges. At the heart of its popularity is real-world adoption. The price of the current token stands at $0.0895 , with more than 583 million RTX sold to date. Remittix has raised in excess of $18.2 million up until now, placing it among the most rapidly growing crypto 2025 launches. The project is now heading towards its $18M soft cap, and a 40% token bonus is active on this presale period. Most importantly, Remittix wallet beta is launching Q3 2025, featuring a mobile-first platform supporting 40+ cryptocurrencies, real-time FX exchange, and low fees. This alone makes Remittix one of the best DeFi projects 2025. Why Remittix Is Taking Off Global Reach: Send crypto to bank accounts in 30+ nations Real-World Utility: Solving real issues, not just keeping up with trends Wallet Launching Q3: Mobile-first platform with cross-chain functionality Over $18.2Million Raised: Backed by growing number of early investors 40% Bonus Live: Now live on presale Besides its token and wallet system, Remittix also boasts a $250,000 crypto giveaway to encourage engagement. With its deflationary tokenomics paired with real-time payment functionality, the project is anything but a token ‚Äî it‚Äôs built to last. The price of PEPE may still go up in the near term, but that is being traded out into deeper-token fundamentals. As the market matures, the optimal long term crypto investment strategies will be in tokens that are both usable and scalable. While Pepe Coin brought humor and excitement in the community, tokens like Remittix (RTX) are the future of crypto ‚Äî addressing real world issues. From convenient bank transfers to low cap cryptocurrency gems, RTX is demonstrating that utility can finally be overtaking entertainment in the altcoin world.

BlockSack is a new memecoin coming to the culture and utility. BlockSack is not your usual meme coin. It just launched on the Base blockchain and is already turning heads. After a strong crypto presale in 2025, BlockSack has earned its spot as the most talked-about Layer 2 meme coin today. But this isn‚Äôt just about jokes. BlockSack brings real features, staking, NFTs, games, and more. Powered by its native BSACK token, the project blends humor and function in one place. Unlike short-term meme trends, BlockSack aims for long-term impact with a full ecosystem and a roadmap to grow fast. Let‚Äôs dive into what makes BlockSack stand out in the crowded meme coin space. What Makes BlockSack Different From Other Meme Coins Most meme coins rely on hype. BlockSack, however, brings utility and culture together. The story begins with ‚ÄúSacktoshi,‚Äù a playful twist on Satoshi Nakamoto. This satirical backstory gives BlockSack a strong brand voice, one that speaks to crypto natives and meme lovers alike. But it‚Äôs not all talk. BlockSack is building real tools. Holders can access NSFW NFTs, stake their tokens, or explore the Sackaverse, a gaming world powered by the BSACK token. This isn‚Äôt just a meme. It‚Äôs a full platform. One standout feature is staking. Users can ‚Äústake their sack‚Äù to earn rewards and boost the ecosystem. It‚Äôs fun, but also functional. As a Layer 2 meme coin on Base, BlockSack benefits from speed, low fees, and a fresh start. In contrast to generic meme coins, BlockSack stands on utility, bold storytelling, and community growth. This shows why it‚Äôs gaining attention as one of the best Base meme projects to follow. Why BlockSack‚Äôs Launch on Base Network Changes the Game BlockSack‚Äôs launch on the Base blockchain brings major advantages. Base offers fast transactions, low gas fees, and strong backing from Coinbase. That‚Äôs why many top meme coin projects are now choosing Base. BlockSack didn‚Äôt just launch; it launched fully equipped. The smart contract is live, audited, and the presale is complete. The team followed through with promises, giving early supporters confidence. The BSACK token is now active and tradable. But what makes this launch special is that it is utility-ready from day one. BlockSack includes a trading bot, NFT tools, and even its own NSFW NFT marketplace called SackMarket. Users can mint adult NFTs, earn royalties, and trade within the community. Meanwhile, gamers can earn BSACK in on-chain competitions. From copy trading to meme battles, the platform rewards user actions. This turns BlockSack into more than just a coin; it becomes an interactive experience. By launching directly on a Layer 2 network, BlockSack avoids the congestion and high fees of Ethereum. This helps boost performance, grow users, and improve token use. That‚Äôs where the real difference lies, and it‚Äôs why the BSACK token could lead the meme coin launch pack this year. Community, Tokenomics & Roadmap Fuel the Hype BlockSack‚Äôs strong start isn‚Äôt only about tech. Its tokenomics and community model are built to last. Out of 690 million BSACK tokens, 40% went to the presale. 25% is set aside for liquidity. The rest support staking, marketing, and the team. This structure creates long-term stability while rewarding early backers. Community is another core focus. BlockSack is growing fast across X (Twitter), Telegram, and meme forums. Contests, giveaways, and meme drives fuel activity. Looking ahead, the roadmap includes staking rewards, a CEX listing, gaming updates, and a PayFi solution. Each step is designed to grow real use and user value. That‚Äôs how BlockSack is building trust within the meme coin community and standing out in the crypto presale 2025 wave. Conclusion: Why BlockSack Deserves Your Watchlist in 2025 BlockSack combines meme culture with real crypto features, and that‚Äôs rare. It has launched with working tools, a smart community, and a roadmap built for growth. The use of the Base blockchain ensures speed and low cost. Meanwhile, the BSACK token powers NFTs, games, staking, and more. This isn‚Äôt just noise; it‚Äôs a plan backed by action.

Why? Because they realized they don‚Äôt own enough,‚Äù Mallers posted on X, adding that the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) race is ‚Äúfar from over‚Äù and ‚ÄúI expect this to heat up.‚Äù US Bitcoin Silence Hints At Bigger Problem In a video attached to the post, the 30-year-old entrepreneur expanded on the point. He praised the administration‚Äôs decision in March to create an SBR but said the follow-through has fallen short: ‚ÄúThe US government has kind of let us down in not giving us the full audit of how much Bitcoin the US government owns. ‚Ä¶ Clearly that information is sensitive or else they would disclose it. ‚Ä¶ I think that the US government is ashamed of its Bitcoin position.‚Äù Related Reading: Bitcoin Net Taker Volume Stays Bearish ‚Äì Fragile Market Structure Risks Liquidation Cascade President Donald Trump‚Äôs Executive Order 14233 on 6 March formally established the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve alongside a broader Digital Asset Stockpile, framing Bitcoin as a ‚Äúunique store of value in the global financial system.‚Äù A follow-up White House fact sheet stressed the goal of ‚Äúpositioning the United States as a leader among nations in government digital-asset strategy.‚Äù Yet when the administration unveiled its 163-page digital-assets strategy on 30 July, the document offered only a fleeting reference to the SBR and no hard figures. Robert ‚ÄúBo‚Äù Hines‚Äîexecutive director of the President‚Äôs Council of Advisers on Digital Assets‚Äînoted, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt discuss that right now ‚Ä¶ There are several reasons we‚Äôre not disclosing that at this time.‚Äù Over the past months, Hines‚Äô tone was not apologetic. ‚ÄúWe want as much Bitcoin as we can possibly get, and we‚Äôre going to continue to work on that,‚Äù he said in a separate interview, describing Bitcoin as ‚Äúdigital gold‚Äù. For years analysts believed the US government controlled well over 200,000 BTC thanks to Silk Road, Bitfinex-hack and other forfeitures. But a Freedom of Information Act response released in mid-July showed the US Marshals Service holding just 28,988 BTC‚Äîabout $3.3 billion at today‚Äôs prices‚Äîrekindling speculation that earlier administrations quietly liquidated a large share of the trove. Separate on-chain data confirm that federal wallets sent 30,175 BTC to Coinbase Prime as early as April 2024, with additional transfers worth $1.9 billion following in December 2024. Related Reading: Bitcoin Stuck In Macro Purgatory‚ÄîTop Analyst Says Q4 Or Bust Mallers seized on those numbers. ‚ÄúI think the Democrats sold off a bunch of that Bitcoin, and they don‚Äôt want to announce anything until they can build the position back,‚Äù he said, calling the audit delay ‚Äúa branding problem‚Äù for a country that bills itself as the future Bitcoin super-power. Market Backdrop Bitcoin is trading above $114,000 after peaking at $123,000 last week, up more than 100 percent year-on-year. The float is already constrained: roughly 92 percent of all coins are mined, and large swaths sit in dormant or long-term-holder wallets. Should the Treasury accelerate SBR purchases‚Äîas Mallers predicts‚Äîthe incremental buy-side pressure could tighten supply further. From Mallers‚Äô vantage point, the political embarrassment he describes is ultimately price-positive: ‚ÄúIf the US wants to plant its flag as the crypto capital, it has no choice but to accumulate. That‚Äôs the bullish takeaway. We‚Äôre talking about a buyer with the deepest pockets on Earth.‚Äù Whether Congress will backstop those purchases is another matter. Senator Cynthia Lummis has re-introduced a bill directing the Treasury to acquire up to one million BTC over five years, but appropriations committees have yet to schedule hearings.

The merger plans to go public on the NYSE as a traded company by raising up to $640 million for a Bitcoin Treasury. The collaboration has been named Parataxis Holdings Inc. and specifically targets the South Korean and U.S. markets. The merger will trade on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the PRTX ticker when it goes public. Parataxis Holdings combines Bitcoin exposure, proprietary growth opportunities, and profitable income creation. It had already targeted South Korea with early inception as Parataxis Korea. The Korean entity had seen its share price increase approximately 4.5x since June 20, 2025, when it announced its transaction with Bridge Biotherapeutics. Parataxis Holdings‚Äô merger with SBXD yields $640M The union between Parataxis Holdings and SBXD provides approximately $240 million to the merger, subject to the redemption of SilverBox Corp IV (SBXD) shareholders. This sum will include around $31 million in equity, drawn from funds raised promptly for the BTC purchase. Moreover, the crypto asset manager has agreed to a share purchase agreement (the ELOC), enabling HoldCo to issue up to $400 million in equity. Combined, these actions could yield up to $640 million to execute and speed up the Bitcoin treasury strategy. At the end of the merger, if each share is valued at $10, Parataxis HoldCo would be worth about $400 million. If the full $400 million from the equity credit line is used at $10 per share, the total value will rise to $800 million. This assumes no investors withdraw before closing and no other funding is added. Edward Chin, Founder and CEO of the crypto asset management firm, commented that the announcement has brought them closer to realizing their vision of creating a public company that provides differentiated exposure to Bitcoin via a disciplined institution that invests across underserved markets. Chin acknowledged that after the close of the deal with SBXD, Parataxis Holdings will be well-positioned to execute the Bitcoin Treasury strategy in the U.S. He added that they will have a better footing to establish in South Korea with Parataxis Korea. He acknowledged SBXD‚Äôs support, mentioning that it has been an excellent partner throughout the process, and they look forward to continuing to work together. Parataxis Holding Inc. joins the Bitcoin treasuries trend alongside Strategy Joe Reece, the Founding Partner of SBXD and Co-managing Partner of SilverBox Capital, acknowledged Ed and the Parataxis Holding team for building a unique and highly scalable digital asset management platform. The crypto asset managing firm and HoldCo‚Äôs securities to be issued in the transaction have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1993. Pending approval from the SEC, they may not be issued in the U.S. The merger follows the ongoing institutional Bitcoin acquisition trend. Bitcoin treasury companies‚Äô current total holdings are nearly $415 billion. In July, approximately 166,000 BTC was accumulated by Bitcoin Treasury companies, increasing total holdings to 3.64 million, which is worth $415.34 billion today. Michael Saylor‚Äôs Strategy had amassed 31,466 BTC by July‚Äôs end, totaling 628,791 BTC. Bitcoin Standard Treasury Company, a more recent entrant, had accumulated 30,021 BTC, ranking fourth among public-listed treasuries. Trump Media and Technology Group held 18,430 BTC after their May capital raise. MARA holdings and XXX hold second and third positions, respectively, with 50,000 and 43,514 BTC. Government holdings like the U.S. Treasury also accumulated 10 BTC, El Salvador 33 BTC, while Bhutan disposed of 776 BTC. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Bitcoin is still hanging on to the low of its bull flag, while the altcoins are generally tracking sideways and downwards. However, once the market does turn again, the altcoins could be set for much greater upside. Bitcoin dominance in bear flag Source: TradingView Bitcoin dominance is a good place to start for sizing up the chances for altcoins. In a decline since hitting 66%, Bitcoin dominance has recently formed a bear flag. While the price is making higher highs and higher lows, this is a typical bear flag setup, therefore a breakdown is likely, and given the overhead resistance, it might be sooner rather than later. A target for the breakdown is the horizontal support at 60%, although if the measured move of the bear flag plays out, the target could be as low as 57%. Bitcoin dominance to 57%? Source: TradingView Zooming out into the weekly time frame for Bitcoin dominance a trendline can be drawn for the long uptrend since 2023. This also acts as a canary in the coalmine, because if this is breached, the way would be clear for that 57% dominance. Total3 bull flag nears breakout Source: TradingView Total3 is the combined market cap of all the cryptocurrencies except $BTC and $ETH, and so is a very good barometer of how the altcoins are doing. The short term chart above shows a bull flag, which is much more likely to exit from the top than from the bottom. A decent horizontal support band is not far under the price so a bull flag breakout could happen soon. If successful, the breakout could take the price to $1.18 trillion, which is the measured move out of the bull flag. This would also result in a new all-time high, boding well for the rest of this bull market cycle. Total3 cup and handle pattern targets $2 trillion Source: TradingView Looking at Total3 on the weekly chart, a cup and handle pattern becomes obvious. The handle is still forming, but if the market cap can get back to $1.13 trillion, this will complete the pattern. A breakout of the neckline would perhaps lead to a retest and confirmation. The measured move would be to $2 trillion - slightly more than a 2x from the current price. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Key Takeaways: Hackers are using old YouTube accounts to promote crypto-draining bots disguised as trading tools. The smart contracts link to scammer wallets, enabling fund theft once victims deposit ETH. AI-generated videos and managed comment sections create a false sense of legitimacy. The operation active since at least 2024 involves misleading videos that direct viewers to deploy a smart contract supposedly designed for automated crypto trading. In reality, the contract contains hidden code that links it to a scammer‚Äôs wallet. Once a user funds the contract, often urged to deposit a minimum of 0.5 ETH, the attacker gains the ability to drain the assets. SentinelLABS: Crypto Scam Shows Mixed Results but Alarming Success SentinelLABS senior researcher Alex Delamottea said the scheme has seen mixed results but is clearly effective. One attacker wallet netted 244.9 ETH, while others collected 7.59 and 4.19 ETH, together totaling over $939,000 at current prices. ‚ÄúThese scams will inevitably work on victims who fail to scrutinize how these tools operate,‚Äù Delamottea warned. What makes the scam particularly deceptive is its delivery. The bad actors are using older YouTube accounts with histories of uploading crypto news, investment advice, or general pop culture content to lend credibility. It‚Äôs unclear whether the scammers created these accounts or purchased them, either is possible, as aged accounts are easily found for sale on Telegram and through search engine ads. Many of the scam videos appear AI-generated, complete with manipulated visuals and voiceovers. This allows the perpetrators to produce numerous videos without revealing their identities. Negative comments are actively removed, while fake testimonials in the comments section claim the bot delivered profits. ‚ÄúThese actors are clearly managing comment sections to maintain an illusion of trust,‚Äù Delamottea said, noting that more skeptical users are starting to turn to Reddit to fact-check the bot. She stressed that crypto traders should avoid deploying code promoted through influencer videos or social media, especially if it promises fast, effortless gains. ‚ÄúUnderstand the tool before using it. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.‚Äù Investor Loses $3M in Crypto Phishing Scam As reported, a cryptocurrency investor has fallen victim to a phishing scam , losing $3.05 million in Tether (USDT) after unknowingly signing a malicious blockchain transaction. The loss, flagged by blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain on Wednesday, underscores the rising threat of phishing attacks targeting digital asset holders. The attacker exploited a common habit among crypto users: validating only the first and last few characters of a wallet address while ignoring the middle. Crypto investors lost over $2.2 billion to hacks , scams, and breaches in the first half of 2025, driven largely by wallet compromises and phishing attacks, according to CertiK‚Äôs latest security report. Wallet breaches alone caused $1.7 billion in losses across just 34 incidents, while phishing scams accounted for over $410 million across 132 attacks.

The move follows disappointing Q2 earnings that triggered a 15% stock decline and prompted the company to announce plans for a $2 billion convertible bond offering. User Backlash Emerges as Free Stablecoin Conversions End Users criticized the fee structure on social media, with some comparing it to traditional banking charges and questioning whether Coinbase was becoming like legacy financial institutions. Hmmm‚Ä¶why I don‚Äôt love the precedent here. What if this dropped to $10k. Feels like bank fees again @coinbase . $1 USD = $1USDC right? pic.twitter.com/l9easdJM2t ‚Äî RYAN SŒûAN ADAMS ‚Äì rsa.eth (@RyanSAdams) August 6, 2025 CEO Brian Armstrong confirmed through social media that the fee addresses competitive disadvantages from Tether‚Äôs existing redemption fees, which made USDC off-ramping the cheapest route for large-scale fiat conversions. The fee applies to net conversion volume calculated by subtracting USDC purchases from sales over rolling 30-day periods. Coinbase personnel described the change as an ‚Äú experiment to better understand how fees impact USDC off-ramping ‚Äù while noting that competitors charge higher fees for fiat conversions. The revenue-generating measure coincides with Coinbase‚Äôs broader financial challenges, including a 39% drop in retail trading volumes to $764 million in Q2 and total revenue of $1.5 billion falling short of analyst expectations. Despite all these, the company continues expanding its ‚Äú everything exchange ‚Äù strategy, especially with its recent rebranding. Stablecoin Wars Drive Fee Introduction as USDT Maintains Market Advantage Industry observers, including prominent trader Cobie, explained that Tether‚Äôs existing exit fees created an arbitrage opportunity where users swapped USDT to USDC before off-ramping to USD. This is probably because Tether has an exit fee, which means the cheapest practical route was to swap USDT to USDC and then off-ramp USDC to USD, which shrinks USDC supply and maintains USDT supply. If I were to guess. ‚Äî Cobie (@cobie) August 7, 2025 This process reduced USDC supply while maintaining USDT circulation, which disadvantaged Circle‚Äôs stablecoin in market share competition. USDT trades at a premium to USDC partly due to demand for collateralizing perpetual futures contracts, which predominantly use Tether as base currency. The premium makes the USDC burn route even more attractive for large-scale conversions, creating pressure on Circle‚Äôs market position. Coinbase‚Äôs fee structure aims to discourage one-way flow from USDC to fiat while offsetting costs associated with facilitating large redemptions. The exchange compared the mechanism to ETF creation and redemption fees, arguing that substantial one-way flows incur operational costs that justify fee implementation. Critics noted the irony that USDC‚Äôs superior utility as a conversion mechanism created disadvantages requiring artificial constraints to maintain competitiveness. Several users suggested that large-scale converters should use Circle‚Äôs direct OTC minting services rather than retail exchange platforms. The fee introduction represents Coinbase‚Äôs effort to optimize liquidity costs and reduce fiat off-ramping by institutional actors while encouraging USDC retention within its ecosystem. The company frames the change as necessary to maintain sustainable stablecoin operations amid competitive pressures. Revenue Pressures Mount as Retail Trading Volumes Decline Coinbase‚Äôs Q2 financial results revealed significant challenges with transaction revenue falling 39% quarter-over-quarter amid declining retail trading activity. XRP emerged as an unexpected bright spot, generating 13% of consumer transaction revenue compared to Ethereum‚Äôs 12% for the second consecutive quarter. The exchange purchased 2,509 Bitcoin worth $222 million during Q2, bringing total holdings to 11,776 BTC and placing it among the top 10 public holders ahead of Tesla. Source: Bitcoin Treasuries However, the Bitcoin accumulation strategy couldn‚Äôt offset broader revenue declines affecting overall performance. Cathie Wood‚Äôs Ark Invest sold $6.5 million worth of Coinbase shares on July 10 despite the stock rising alongside Bitcoin‚Äôs surge to new all-time highs.

Per its Wednesday announcement, the company mined 728 BTC, edging out MARA‚Äôs 703 BTC, despite deploying only 50 EH/s‚Äîless than MARA‚Äôs 58.9 EH/s. IREN also used more than 90% of its fleet. Its stock climbed over 11% intraday, changing hands at $18.32, notably ahead of the 1% to 5% increases seen by most rival Bitcoin mining firms. IREN pulled in $114,891 per Bitcoin Despite the recent spike in mining difficulty , which has pushed up energy demands and narrowed margins, IREN still pulled in revenue from Bitcoin mining. For the month of July, the company maintained a 45.4 EH/s average and earned $114,891 per BTC, while MARA trailed slightly at 43.94 EH/s, operating with less than 75% fleet utilization. Daniel Roberts, IREN‚Äôs co-founder and co-CEO, even commented on their earnings, ‚ÄúWe delivered another month of record revenue of $86m and record hardware profits of $66m in July, supported by strong Bitcoin mining economics and continued demand for our AI Cloud services.‚Äù The company also raked in $2.3 million in earnings from its computing operations. In early July, IREN had bought 2,400 of the Nvidia Blackwell GPUs to accelerate the expansion of its AI Cloud Services. Overall, the company‚Äôs market cap spiked to $4.11 billion, securing its position as the second-largest public Bitcoin miner by market cap, after overtaking Riot Platforms and Core Scientific. Only MARA remains ahead. Meanwhile, MARA‚Äôs July performance dipped compared to June, when it mined 950 BTC‚Äîits highest output since the 2024 Bitcoin halving. June‚Äôs output contributed to a robust Q2 that saw revenue rise 64% YoY to $238 million. Currently, the company holds 50,639 BTC, making it the world‚Äôs second-largest corporate holder after MicroStrategy. Its stock is also up 2%, trading at $15.91. Other companies like CleanSpark have also continued to boost their treasury. Now it has over 12,700 self-mined Bitcoin. CleanSpark CEO Zach Bradford remarked, ‚ÄúImportantly, we continued to self-fund our operations through strategic Bitcoin sales, enabling ongoing accumulation while avoiding any use of equity financing or shareholder dilution.‚Äù Cipher Mining also reported it mined 214 BTC in July, sold 52 BTC, and increased its total holdings to 1,219 BTC. Culper Research had called out IREN on its AI projects Previously, Culper Research labeled IREN ‚Äúwildly overvalued, ‚Äúarguing that though the company flaunted its AI ambitions, its project was underfunded. He compared IREN‚Äôs AI strategy to entering the Monaco Grand Prix, only in a Toyota Prius. After these calais, IREN saw a steep drop from $12.31 to $5.59 in April, before rebounding sharply, climbing more than 227% to $18.32 over the last four months. IREN is connected to 2,910 MW of grid power and supports a vertically integrated model capable of delivering everything from powered shells and tailored infrastructure to full-service colocation and cloud hosting. Besides, CEO Roberts emphasized that they are focused on running both Bitcoin miners and their GPUs in parallel to build their infrastructure and ability to capitalize on evolving market demand.

The token rose despite the recent delisting from the Binance futures market. MemeFi (MEMEFI) performed one of the most dramatic rallies for the past week, gaining up to 312% over the week. The overall consensus is the MEMEFI rally is extremely risky and can break down at any moment. MEMEFI was one of the tokens listed by Transac in December 2024, as previously reported by Cryptopolitan. MEMEFI rallied to a three-month high on a short squeeze, as the Binance delisting is looming on August 11. | Source: CoinGecko . As a paradox, the MEMEFI rally started just as Binance announced it would delist the asset following months of low-level activity and sideways trading. MEMEFI recovered to $0.005, a level not seen since May. Previously, MEMEFI has performed similar rallies, crashing by over 90% within hours or days. The token peaked at $0.012 soon after its launch in November 2024, once again erasing over 90% of its value. The recent rally recalls Alpaca Finance (ALPACA), which rose sharply due to a short squeeze following its delisting from Binance. Since June, ALPACA returned to its baseline lows of $0.02 . MemeFi open interest rose to all-time high MEMEFI open interest matched the price rally, rising to an all-time high. Traders opened positions for $36.92M, as activity shifted to OKX and Gate . However, the actual end of the futures contract will arrive on August 11 at 8:30 UTC. Until then, traders are making their last aggressive moves on the Binance futures market. Binance warned it will stop stabilizing the market in the final hour of trading, giving a few more days of peak activity and risky positions. Binance may also change the conditions of the contract at any time before the delisting. Most of the new open interest came from short positions, with positions rising to 54% of the total. This led to $1.28M in short liquidations on Binance, in the last hours of trading just before the delisting. Additional short liquidations happened on Huobi. Other spot markets boosted the price of MEMEFI, leading to the near-vertical rally. The price action can break down at any time, as most MEMEFI markets have limited depth and can lead to fast slippage. The low depth also allowed for the fast vertical rise. MemeFi hints at rebuilding The rally of MemeFi also boosted the team‚Äôs visibility, showcasing their upcoming upgrade. The MemeFi team announced an app upgrade coming at the end of August. MemeFi Mini App 2.0 31.08.2025 pic.twitter.com/kHxUCw7cGk ‚Äî MemeFi Labs (@memeficlub) August 6, 2025 However, in the short term, the MEMEFI asset is seen as extremely risky and unreliable, especially for derivative trading. Previously, MEMEFI has been shilled by influencers, trying to ride the market momentum during the 2024 bull market. However, loss of interest in Web3 projects and a market correction led to the current thin market. Demand for MEMEFI is currently mostly tied to covering short positions, with little demand for the underlying game. Based on DappRadar data , the gamified Web3 app is currently inactive, with a negligible number of users and transactions. The upcoming new app may aim to draw in users again following a period of low interest in on-chain gaming. Want your project in front of crypto‚Äôs top minds?

49681283,550112,1754553639,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49681283.jpeg,"Only One XRP Wallet Supports Cardano‚Äôs Glacier Airdrop, Says Developer",https://bitcoinist.com/only-one-xrp-wallet-cardano-glacier-airdrop/,"The airdrop from the Cardano-affiliated Midnight Foundation is now live, but for holders of XRP there is, for the moment, just a single route to participate. On 6 August, Wietse Wind‚Äîfounder of XRPL Labs and lead developer of the self-custody Xaman Wallet‚Äî told his followers on X that ‚ÄúXaman Wallet is the only XRP wallet currently officially supported by the project ‚Ä¶ Only sign in with Xaman is safe (otherwise you‚Äôre probably dealing with a scam).‚Äù The warning framed the launch of Midnight‚Äôs ‚ÄúGlacier‚Äù token distribution and set the tone for a security-first approach to an event Wind predicts will attract ‚Äúspam, scam, uncertainty and crime.‚Äù What XRP Holders Need To Know Now The Midnight Foundation took its snapshot of XRP balances at Ledger index 96724473. Eligibility begins at precisely 43.29 XRP‚Äîabout $28 at press time‚Äîand scales upward on a pro-rata basis. While balances are checked on the XRP Ledger, the airdrop itself is delivered exclusively to fresh Cardano addresses; the project will not send NIGHT to XRP addresses under any circumstance, forcing cross-chain participation by design. Wind stressed that users ‚Äúwill need a fresh Cardano (ADA) wallet for the claim destination‚Äù and that only one claim per identity is allowed. Midnight has allocated five percent of its 24-billion NIGHT supply‚Äîabout 1.2 billion tokens‚Äîto XRP holders, a figure confirmed in project documentation. The claim window opened at 13:00 UTC on 5 August and will remain live for sixty days. Any tokens left on the table will migrate into a thirty-day ‚ÄúScavenger Mine,‚Äù followed by a four-year ‚ÄúLost-and-Found‚Äù period that allows original claimants to recover uncollected balances. Because the Glacier claim page operates only on desktop browsers, Wind urged users to type the URL manually‚Äîclaim.midnight.gd‚Äîrather than clicking links that circulate on social media. ‚ÄúThere are scams EVERYWHERE pretending to be Xaman / Xaman support / me / my team ‚Ä¶ TRUST NO ONE,‚Äù he wrote, directing anyone with questions to Xaman‚Äôs in-app support chat. He repeated the same guidance in an earlier 30 July thread, insisting that users ‚ÄúTrust NO SOCIAL MEDIA. Trust NO WEBSITE. Trust NO DM-MESSAGES. Trust NO (potentially fake) XRPL Labs / Xaman staff on social.‚Äù The developer promised that Xaman will surface step-by-step instructions in a dedicated in-app module‚Äîcalled an xApp‚Äîonce the Glacier team has finalized its verification flow. Until that notification appears, he told users, ‚ÄúThere is currently no action required.‚Äù The wallet‚Äôs official account reinforced the point hours later: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt trust links on social or in DMs. Expect increased scams, impersonators, and confusion. Use only Xaman‚Äôs in-app support for questions. Stay cautious. Stay self-custodial.‚Äù Wind‚Äôs insistence on a single supported wallet is rooted in the way Glacier validates claims. Xaman‚Äôs transaction-signing format can be recognized programmatically, allowing the airdrop contract to verify ownership without additional middleware. Other wallets could, in theory, integrate the same flow, but Midnight ‚Äôs developers have opted for a narrow rollout to reduce the attack surface during the claim window. Any deviation from above, Wind said, is almost certainly a phishing attempt. ‚ÄúWe will communicate about this in-app, through an xApp to prevent confusion and scammers taking advantage of the uncertainty on social media,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúWhen users can take action to participate, we will inform our users though in-app communication.‚Äù As the timer on Glacier‚Äôs 58-day claim period begins to tick down, the road map for XRP holders is unambiguous: use Xaman, ignore every other link, and wait for the push notification inside the wallet. The tokens themselves may be destined for Cardano, but the gateway‚Äîat least for now‚Äîremains anchored firmly in the ecosystem, guarded by a developer who has staked his reputation on keeping the doors locked against impostors.

That date marks the scheduled filing of a joint status update , which is expected to clarify the standing of remaining appeals in the case. The potential for a decisive conclusion or a further extension has led to renewed analysis of the parties‚Äô likely strategies. In a recent conversation on X, former SEC attorney Marc Fagel offered insights into what could unfold by mid-August. Responding to a question from Zach Rector, who asked about the likelihood that Ripple and the SEC will drop their appeals by the deadline, Fagel stated that the parties are highly incentivized to have dismissals submitted by then or to be in a position to inform the court that dismissals are actively being processed. Implications for Case Closure Fagel‚Äôs statement adds to speculation that both sides may be aiming to conclude the remaining procedural matters without further delay. While Fagel refrained from making a specific prediction, his assessment shows that practical motivations are at play. According to him, the parties are incentivized to resolve outstanding appeals to avoid further court involvement or potential requests for additional extensions. In late June, Ripple announced that it would drop its cross-appeal . The community also expects the SEC to do the same, but no formal withdrawal has been recorded. The upcoming August 15 status update is therefore significant, as it may confirm whether both Ripple and the SEC are following through on their previously signaled intentions. Will Both Parties End the Lawsuit? Responding to a request for elaboration, Fagel noted that both sides intend to drop the appeals, suggesting that neither party would want to return to the Court of Appeals unprepared or request more time. He believes they want to avoid unnecessary delays, and their recent actions support this theory. Both parties clearly plan to drop their appeals. Neither wants to go to the Court of Appeals and say ""we're not ready yet, please give us another extension on moving forward with the appeals."" ‚Äî Marc Fagel (@Marc_Fagel) August 5, 2025 We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Both parties spent months for an indicative ruling from Judge Annalisa Torres on their settlement agreement, which would have lowered Ripple‚Äôs penalty from $125 million to $50 million and removed the permanent injunction preventing institutional XRP sales. After she denied their joint motion seeking the indicative ruling, Ripple expressed its desire to move on, reaffirming the previous ruling that XRP is not a security. With both parties eager to move on, August 15 might mark the end of the legal battle. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

While the Ethereum trend is expected to continue in the coming years, a new analysis has come from Standard Chartered. Geoffrey Kendrick of Standard Chartered compared ETH ETFs to public companies buying Ethereum. Kendrick assessed that buying stocks of companies that buy ETH is better than buying Ethereum ETFs. According to Kendirck, Ethereum treasury companies have purchased 1.6% of all ETH in circulation since June, and that amount is now on par with ETH ETFs. At this point, the analyst said treasury holdings are now very investable and present a stronger argument for investors than US spot Ethereum ETFs. Kendrick noted that the net asset value (NAV) premiums for Ethereum treasury companies are now just above 1, making it a better buy option than US spot ETH ETFs due to staking and DeFi exposure. Kendrick added that ETH treasury holdings are expected to grow faster due to the increased acceptance of cryptocurrencies by institutions as institutional reserve assets and ETH‚Äôs ability to generate returns. *This is not investment advice.

Analyst Says This Is Final Chance to Get Rich,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-has-formed-the-golden-entry-analyst-says-this-is-final-chance-to-get-rich/,"A recent analysis from crypto analyst Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto) has refocused attention on XRP‚Äôs price structure, highlighting what he calls a ‚ÄúGolden Entry‚Äù point. Drawing comparisons to XRP‚Äôs price action in late 2017, the analyst points to a recurring pattern that preceded XRP‚Äôs historic surge to its previous all-time high. Using monthly candlestick charts, Steph identifies a triangular consolidation phase that, in 2017, led directly into a significant breakout. His post suggests that XRP is once again in a similar technical setup. The Repeating Pattern The side-by-side charts in the post depict two distinct timeframes. The left panel shows XRP‚Äôs price activity in 2017, where the token moved from sub-cent levels to over $3.3. At the time, the asset experienced a clear breakout from a symmetrical triangle , which was followed by exponential gains. Steph marks this breakout as the Golden Entry, emphasizing its role as a strategic point for accumulation before XRP‚Äôs rapid ascent. The asset‚Äôs climb to a new all-time high in July has put it in a similar position. The chart on the right shows that this bull run remains active. Steph advises investors to accumulate now, as this may be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. #XRP HAS FORMED THE GOLDEN ENTRY! This is your final chance to get rich. pic.twitter.com/4YH5Bqau7Q ‚Äî STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) August 6, 2025 Current Market Context and Analyst‚Äôs View Steph‚Äôs assertion implies XRP may be poised for a substantial price movement, provided the pattern plays out comparably. It‚Äôs worth noting that XRP has seen major events since 2017, including regulatory challenges and ongoing litigation with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 However, the lawsuit is nearing a resolution , and this would remove a key overhang on XRP‚Äôs price, freeing it up for growth. Steph‚Äôs analysis focuses solely on chart structure and historical precedent, and provides a strong case for a new price discovery phase for XRP. Potential Implications for XRP Holders The concept of a Golden Entry suggests a narrow window of opportunity for strategic accumulation . For market participants who accept technical analysis as a decision-making tool, this signal may prompt increased interest in XRP. Steph‚Äôs analysis offers a perspective that may resonate with those who view XRP‚Äôs past performance as a guide to its future. The recurring triangle breakout pattern is visually compelling, but whether XRP can replicate its previous surge remains uncertain. For now, Steph Is Crypto‚Äôs post has positioned XRP‚Äôs current chart pattern as pivotal, and market observers will be watching closely to see if the breakout leads to the kind of rally seen in 2017.

This price action places XRP squarely within the range articulated by market analyst Adex crypt. The analyst noted , ‚ÄúXRP remains bearish below $3.02. A dip beneath $2.91 may lead to further declines toward $2.78, with extended targets at $2.60 and $2.45. However, a breakout above $3.09 could trigger bullish momentum, eyeing $3.40, $3.70, and $3.85.‚Äù Navigating this scenario, traders are watching key thresholds. Holding above $2.91 may stave off downside pressure, but should the price slip below that mark, a slide toward $2.78 and potentially a further drop toward $2.60 and $2.45 could unfold. Conversely, pushing firmly above $3.09 would unlock bullish potential, opening the door toward $3.40 and possibly stretching to $3.65 or even $3.85. Technically speaking, XRP has remained rangebound for now. Recent reports highlight resistance near $3.10 to $3.20, and a descending channel that‚Äôs muted upside. Meanwhile, on the fundamentals front, XRP‚Äôs flirtation with the $3 mark comes amid renewed regulatory developments. For instance, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is scheduled to deliberate Ripple‚Äôs appeal withdrawal, while market participants show rising institutional interest, including ETF filings in Japan by SBI Holdings. BDACS Rolls Out Institutional-Grade Support for XRP South Korea just hit a major milestone in regulated crypto infrastructure as BDACS, a licensed cryptocurrency custodian, officially launches institutional-grade custody services for XRP. Born from its strategic partnership with Ripple, the rollout bridges the gap between regulatory compliance and institutional access to digital assets. Reliable Custody Meets Regulatory Compliance Through integration with Ripple Custody, Ripple‚Äôs enterprise-grade custody platform, BDACS now offers secure, compliant storage, management, and deployment of XRP for Korean banks, funds, and asset managers. Crucially, this system is tightly aligned with South Korea‚Äôs Financial Services Commission regulatory roadmap, addressing key institutional concerns around compliance and risk. Seamless Exchange Integration The service extends beyond custody. BDACS has connected with top domestic exchanges, such as Upbit, Coinone, and Korbit, enabling institutional clients to move XRP across Korea‚Äôs most liquid trading platforms with ease and full regulatory transparency. Why It Matters XRP is already among the most actively traded digital assets in Korea. Previously, institutions were hindered by fragmented options and insufficient custodial frameworks. With BDACS now offering regulated, onshore custody, institutional adoption barriers are being dismantled, paving the way for greater liquidity, stability, and long-term growth. Moreover, this initiative aligns with broader projections that crypto custody could manage trillions in assets by 2030, while digital asset tokenization could represent up to 10% of global GDP, signaling a shift toward token-based financial infrastructure. Broader Strategic Context This development marks the first tangible outcome of the BDACS‚ÄìRipple collaboration, building upon Ripple‚Äôs regional strategy to deepen institutional adoption across Asia. In addition to XRP, BDACS also supports RLUSD, Ripple‚Äôs U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin. The impact is already evident: South Korea is one of the world‚Äôs most crypto-engaged markets, with over 25% of individuals aged 20‚Äì50 holding digital assets with 4 in 10 expressing willingness to invest more if supported by regulated institutions. Conclusion BDACS‚Äôs institutional-grade support for XRP represents a significant leap forward for South Korea‚Äôs digital asset ecosystem. By offering compliant custody and seamless exchange access, the collaboration with Ripple sets new standards for institutional crypto participation, positioning XRP to play an increasingly central role in Asia‚Äôs evolving financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, XRP‚Äôs next move hinges on whether it can break and stay above the $3.09 barrier or if it falls back below $2.91.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,XRP|ASIA|TRADING|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-07 09:10:06

49684910,https://invezz.com/?p=2828087,1754558119,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,India‚Äôs ED seizes $4.8M in assets tied to Coinbase spoofing scam mastermind,https://invezz.com/news/2025/08/07/indias-ed-seizes-4-8m-in-assets-tied-to-coinbase-spoofing-scam-mastermind/,"India‚Äôs Enforcement Directorate (ED) has seized assets worth ‚Çπ42.8 crore ($4.8 million) linked to Chirag Tomar, who defrauded thousands of investors across the globe by mimicking crypto exchange Coinbase. On Tuesday, officials at the financial crimes watchdog issued a press release detailing the seizure of 18 immovable properties in Delhi and multiple bank accounts held by Tomar, his relatives, and his business associates. The ED said the provisional attachment was carried out under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) after authorities traced illicit crypto funds funnelled into real estate and bank deposits in India. The attached properties include high-value real estate holdings across India‚Äôs capital, along with bank accounts containing laundered funds. According to the ED, these assets were acquired using proceeds from an international cryptocurrency phishing scheme that Tomar ran before his arrest in the United States in December 2023. Investigators found that Tomar had converted stolen digital assets into Indian rupees through peer-to-peer trading platforms and used the funds to purchase luxury items, including Lamborghinis, Porsches, and designer watches, as well as to finance foreign travel. A large portion of the stolen funds was funnelled into India and parked under the names of relatives and shell entities, the agency added. Ongoing probe and possible further action The ED began its probe after learning about Tomar‚Äôs arrest through international media reports. In February, it conducted coordinated raids across multiple locations in Delhi and Mumbai to trace the money trail. Officials say the investigation remains active and more seizures or arrests may follow. ‚ÄúThe proceeds of crime were layered and integrated into the banking system by purchasing immovable properties in India,‚Äù the ED noted in an accompanying statement. The agency has not ruled out further action against other accomplices who may have assisted Tomar in laundering funds domestically. Coinbase users targeted all across the globe Chirag Tomar, 31, was sentenced to 60 months in federal prison by a US court in October 2024 after pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud. His scheme, which ran for over two years, involved creating spoofed websites that mimicked Coinbase, a leading cryptocurrency exchange with operations spanning several jurisdictions across the globe. The fake sites were designed to appear nearly identical to Coinbase‚Äôs official page but contained altered contact details. Tomar and his team even used search engine optimisation to ensure their counterfeit URLs ranked above genuine ones, making them easier for unsuspecting users to find. When users attempted to log in, the spoofed site would return error messages and direct them to the scammers, who then manipulated victims into sharing sensitive security codes or granting remote access to their devices. US prosecutors estimated that Tomar stole over $20 million in crypto assets, affecting hundreds of victims globally. Past court filings have even highlighted cases where individuals lost their life savings to the scam, including one North Carolina resident who lost more than $240,000 in a single incident. Tomar laundered over $72 million worth of crypto proceeds across multiple platforms, converting large portions into Indian rupees and investing them in property and other high-value assets. The ED alleges that several associates played a role in this laundering process, including those responsible for managing mule accounts and coordinating fund transfers. India emerges as a hotbed for crypto scams Over the past years, India has witnessed a surge in cases involving crypto-related financial crimes , from romance scams and phishing attacks to fraudulent coin offerings and Ponzi schemes. According to data from another crypto exchange, MEXC, India ranked first globally in detected crypto trading fraud in early 2025, with nearly 27,000 flagged accounts‚Äîmarking a 17% year-over-year increase. Much of this is due to a lack of financial literacy and the fact that the booming crypto sector in the country remains in a regulatory grey zone , with no comprehensive framework to govern digital asset platforms, protect consumers, or ensure accountability among service providers.

Decentralized Binance Alternatives Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) represent a trustless alternative to Binance compared to other crypto exchanges. DEXs run entirely on smart-contract protocols and execute transactions directly on the blockchain. No KYC verification is required. All you need is a Web3 wallet (e.g. MetaMask), a few network-native tokens for gas, and you‚Äôre ready to swap coins on the blockchain. DEXs are the fastest path to crypto trading. However, they are ideal for tech-savvy and advanced users, who understand on-chain data and know how to use network explorers like BSC scan. PancakeSwap PancakeSwap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) and automated market maker (AMM) that operates on the BNB Smart Chain. It enables DeFi transactions and activities, including BEP-20 token swaps, staking, yield farming, liquidity provision, and more. The DEX is powered by the native governance token CAKE, which has a buyback-and-burn mechanism. PancakeSwap is the best alternative DEX to Binance since it‚Äôs built on the BNB Smart Chain. It offers access to a variety of Binance support tokens with 706 listed tokens and 1,320 trading pairs. Pancake pumps billions of dollars in trading volume like its centralized counterpart, Binance. Uniswap Uniswap is one of the earliest and top decentralized exchanges in the crypto space. It‚Äôs the best Binance alternative for traders looking for exposure to the Ethereum network. Uniswap enables swaps on other networks, including Binance Smart Chain (BSC), as well as other layer-2 chains. The DEX boasts billions of dollars worth of trading volumes across all networks, making it more versatile than Binance. Uniswap V3 on BSC has 150 tokens and 286 trading pairs, while Uniswap V4 on BSC lists 54 tokens and 138 trading pairs. On Ethereum, Uniswap has thousands of tokens and trading pairs, giving traders a variety of options and deep liquidity. The UNI token is Uniswap‚Äôs native token, fueling the ecosystem with governance, staking, yield farming, and other DeFi activities. SunSwap Sunswap is a decentralized exchange built on the Tron network. The DEX has less trading volume compared to PancakeSwap and Uniswap, but it‚Äôs the best choice for traders moving from Binance to the Tron ecosystem. Sunswap lists 77 coins across 127 trading pairs. That figure combines both Sunswap V2 and V3. Most of Sunswap‚Äôs trading volume occurs in the USDT/WTRX pair, making its trading options somewhat limited. Overall, Sunswap is the best pick for decentralized trading of Tron tokens after Binance. What to look for in a Binance alternative? Listed Cryptocurrencies Rich availability of cryptocurrencies on a centralized exchange is vital for winning users over. When looking for a Binance alternative, it‚Äôs important to look at the number of listed coins. Binance has 407 coins available for trading across 1,478 pairs. Any alternative to Binance should match‚Äîor ideally beat‚Äîthat lineup. Deposit Methods Binance covers a wide range of deposit methods. You can easily transfer fiat via bank deposits, credit and debit cards, or even Apple Pay and Google Pay. If you‚Äôd rather not use any of those, you can always hop onto Binance‚Äôs P2P market to pay or cash out. A solid Binance alternative should offer multiple deposit options and local payment channels. And since Binance supports 35 fiat currencies, a great alternative should match or beat that. Fees Exploring fees on alternatives to Binance is a make-or-break point. Competing with Binance is tough as it offers some of the cheapest trading fees in the crypto market. Binance charges a base fee of 0.1%, which you can drop to 0.075% by using BNB. A solid Binance alternative should match those rates. Most centralized exchanges sweeten the deal for volume traders, so finding one that fits your trading style without eating into your profits is key. Trading Products and Volume Finding the right trading product that matches your needs is a big deal. Binance boasts options like spot trading, margin trading, derivatives trading, and even social or copy trading. A solid Binance alternative should offer a mix of trading features‚Äîor at least the ones you need. And of course, the trading volume should be hefty, hovering close to Binance‚Äôs overall volume. Learning Resources Guides and content geared towards teaching users how to use an exchange are critical. The Binance Academy is one of the earliest and most popular crypto learning hubs. An alternative to Binance should offer extensive learning materials and guides that help users learn and navigate its platform. Most crypto platforms have followed in the footsteps of Binance and created an equivalent to the Binance Academy. Look for an exchange that has learning materials that are easy to find and consume. Supported Countries Binance does not support all countries. If you live in one of these countries and need an alternative to Binance, look for a centralized exchange with similar features, perks, versatility, and volume that‚Äôs legally allowed in your area. Security Trading on a highly secure centralized exchange is paramount. Binance has strong security measures in place. Most user funds are held offline, and reserves are audited monthly. A proof of reserves (POR) audit helps verify that assets are backed 1:1, and that‚Äôs important. On the user side, Binance enforces 2FA, anti-phishing codes, withdrawal whitelisting, and real-time risk management. Look for an alternative to Binance that has public, transparent records of its asset holdings and strong account security protocols. Wrapping Up The crypto space is full of exchanges trying to attract users and win them over. Binance is the number one crypto exchange in the world in terms of trading volume, making it the right crypto exchange for investment opportunities. However, there are other top crypto exchanges trying to secure a slice of the market. And some people want an alternative to Binance due to restrictions or just to switch things up and try a new trading experience. Whether you‚Äôre hunting for lower fees, deeper liquidity, a bigger coin roster, or a more social trading vibe, there‚Äôs a Binance alternative out there that‚Äôs just right for you.","Deep Dive - Crypto, Web3 & Market Insights|Binance",EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|TRADING|BNB|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-07 09:15:23

NBC 7 in San Diego reports that in June, Alixe Garcia received a text asking her if she authorized a large purchase at Best Buy. Garcia received a call after texting back ‚Äúno‚Äù. She says she trusted the call the moment she answered the phone because the caller ID showed it was from a Wells Fargo customer service number. Garcia says that during the 41-minute call, it sounded as if she was talking with someone who was able to view her accounts. She ended up transferring $5,700 to Apple Cash, believing that the money would be deposited into her new Wells Fargo account that the caller supposedly helped her create. Thirty minutes later, when she logged in, the money was not there. ‚ÄúI waited another 30 minutes. I‚Äôm, like, ‚ÄòMaybe it‚Äôs a little slow.‚Äô No money. Then I was just, like, sick thinking about it.‚Äù She called the bank the next morning, but the agent told her that the person she was talking to was not from the bank. Her money is also gone. Wells Fargo says that its security controls were functioning as intended, and Garcia ultimately authorized the transfers. The bank warns consumers that if they get a similar call asking them to send a payment, transfer funds or send their physical cards to stop fraud in their account, they should immediately hang up and call their bank directly. ‚ÄúSafeguarding our customers‚Äô assets is our top priority, and we are actively working to raise awareness of common scams through various resources and ongoing education.

Memecoins have been the punchline and the payday of the crypto space. Dogecoin barked its way to mainstream stardom, Shiba Inu wagged behind with a vengeance, and the rest tried to go viral overnight. But in 2025, things are shifting. XRPINU enters the scene not as a copycat, but as a clever remix - one that understands both the power of satire and the need for a solid backbone. It's crypto culture with a master plan. Irony, Meet Infrastructure XRPINU is a memecoin that laughs at the industry while learning from it. Its branding echoes XRP, but with a smirk. Its slogans are ridiculous, yet calculated. And behind all the fun is a presale system, tokenomics, and roadmap that could put some utility tokens to shame. You‚Äôll find: A parody logo and meme art that ridicule crypto‚Äôs usual seriousness A 15-stage presale structure with rising price incentives $1 million in USDT set aside for liquidity - no empty hype This is not just trolling. It‚Äôs tactical. Tokenomics That Know What They‚Äôre Doing Supply: 100,000,000,000 XRPINU tokens Presale: 75 billion tokens, sold in structured phases Launch Liquidity: 10 billion tokens + $1M USDT Each presale stage increases in price, creating FOMO but with clarity. Liquidity is pre-funded and locked, solving the rug-pull paranoia that haunts many memecoins. It's built to reward early participants while staying transparent. From Meme Thread to Real Thread This isn‚Äôt a one-hit wonder. The XRPINU roadmap stretches into 2026: Q3 2025 - Website and community go live, meme contests and early marketing Q4 2025 - DEX debut, token listings, liquidity locked Q1 2026 - Expansion to centralized exchanges, launch of voting tools Q2 2026 - XRPINU Wallet release, early integration of features Q3 2026 - Real-life events, possible blockchain spin-off begins testing Where others fade, XRPINU intends to evolve. Viral by Design The community isn‚Äôt just invited - it‚Äôs the engine. XRPINU‚Äôs team knows that the memecoin market is built on social momentum. So it‚Äôs designed with: Cartoon versions of crypto insiders and regulators Twitter raids and Telegram engagement strategies Governance features that let holders decide the project‚Äôs fate It‚Äôs Dogecoin energy with DAO ambitions. How to Join the Movement Connect a crypto wallet (MetaMask or ERC-compatible) Select ETH, USDT, or SOL to purchase XRPINU Claim tokens after the presale - early buyers get the best price Buy-in is straightforward, and each new stage of the presale raises the price. Timing matters. Final Take: The Smartest Joke in Crypto? XRPINU doesn‚Äôt pretend to be something it‚Äôs not. It is a meme. But it‚Äôs also a calculated, community-first token that‚Äôs looking past launch day. In an age where even serious projects go nowhere, maybe the ones with a punchline and a plan are what the space really needs. This isn‚Äôt Dogecoin 2.0. It‚Äôs something else entirely. >> VISIT THE PRESALE! Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

According to a diplomatic cable seen by Reuters , Rubio signed off on a directive dated 4 August ordering US embassies to engage European officials and push for changes to the landmark legislation. Rubio wants a campaign to amend or repeal the law The DSA came into force earlier this year as part of the EU‚Äôs efforts to regulate digital platforms. It requires large tech firms to do more to tackle illegal online content, including hate speech, misinformation and child abuse material. But Washington views the rules as overreaching. The cable, described as an ‚Äúaction request‚Äù, says the DSA imposes ‚Äúundue‚Äù restrictions on expression and burdens US firms with excessive compliance costs. Diplomats were told to lobby for ‚Äúrepeal and/or amendment‚Äù of the DSA or related laws across the EU‚Äôs 27 member states. ‚ÄúPosts should focus efforts to build host government and other stakeholder support,‚Äù the directive said, adding that suggested talking points would be provided. It also urged envoys to track incidents of what it called ‚Äúcensorship‚Äù, defined as any state or corporate action to suppress protected expression. Examples listed included arrests, court cases and online suspensions involving US citizens or firms. The US State Department declined to comment. The office of EU tech commissioner Henna Virkkunen did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A key concern for Washington is the DSA‚Äôs broad definition of ‚Äú illegal content ‚Äù. The US wants that definition narrowed to protect political and religious speech. Officials are also calling for the EU to scale back fines for non-compliance and reconsider its use of ‚Äútrusted flaggers‚Äù, groups empowered to report problematic content directly to platforms. They also suggest rolling back the Code of Practice on Disinformation, a framework set up under the DSA that the US says enables overly restrictive content moderation. In March, the head of the US Federal Communications Commission said the DSA clashed with America‚Äôs First Amendment traditions. Vice President JD Vance has previously accused the EU of suppressing speech by right-wing parties, including Germany‚Äôs AfD, remarks that drew sharp criticism from European leaders. American tech firms back Washington‚Äôs stance Major US platforms have also voiced concern. Meta , which owns Facebook and Instagram, has warned the rules risk turning into censorship. Elon Musk, owner of X (formerly Twitter), has also pushed back on EU content moderation policies. Other US tech giants, including Google-owner Alphabet , and Amazon, have remained relatively quiet but are widely seen as affected by the DSA‚Äôs strict requirements. President Trump has made online free speech a central issue, accusing the previous Biden administration of encouraging censorship. In a high-profile ruling last year, the US Supreme Court found the Biden White House had not violated free speech protections when urging platforms to limit misinformation on vaccines and elections. Now, under Trump‚Äôs leadership, Rubio has taken a harder line. In May, he floated visa bans for foreign officials who ‚Äúcensor‚Äù Americans online and hinted that regulators targeting US companies could face consequences. Despite US objections, the EU maintains that the DSA is not aimed at American firms. ‚ÄúThis legislation will not be changed. The DMA and the DSA are not on the table in the trade negotiations with the US,‚Äù Commission spokesperson Thomas Regnier said earlier this year. European officials insist the rules are necessary to ensure safety and transparency in the digital space, and to hold tech platforms accountable. Whether Washington‚Äôs diplomatic pressure will sway EU capitals remains unclear. But the move marks a rare and public transatlantic clash over how to govern the online world, one that could shape global tech regulation for years to come. Get seen where it counts.

However, the clouds are starting to gather as something big takes shape just over the horizon. Is this the storm that is going to send Bitcoin into its final blow-off top stage, or will it send the price crashing into the next bear market? Bull flags are bullish When Bitcoin has been going sideways for around three weeks in a bull flag pattern that is much smaller than the previous flag that took around six weeks to break, it is probably time to sit up and start taking notice. A bull flag pattern says it all in the name - it's bullish. Also, it‚Äôs a bull flag pattern that has formed at the back end of this bull market cycle. The probabilities of this breaking to the upside are pretty good. $BTC price back inside bull flag Source: TradingView The 4-hour chart for $BTC shows how the price has now crept its way back into the bull flag after many traders were undoubtedly liquidated due to the sweep down to $112,000. Be that as it may, this test of the $112,000 horizontal support laid a foundation down, confirming it as an important price structure level. The W pattern, which looked as though it might break out, refused to do so, and the price was stopped in its tracks and rejected at the neckline. That said, there is the possibility that the price has another go at the neckline, and a W pattern could still play out, albeit not the original one. RSI points to potential huge move Source: TradingView The daily chart illustrates how the price has been bouncing from the 50-day SMA, and how it has spent the last three days consolidating inside the bull flag. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at the bottom of the chart provides a bullish possibility. Looking left, it can be seen that when the indicator line last broke through the yellow moving average and the descending trendline, the price action moved up 25%, corresponding to a move of nearly $25,000. If the indicator line can angle upwards and break through these two barriers again, a move of a similar magnitude could begin. The indicator line will need to be watched very closely. Inverse head and shoulders pattern Vs Stochastic RSI indicators Source: TradingView The weekly chart shows the inverse head and shoulders pattern that could provide the signal for this next stage of the bull run. As can be seen above, the $BTC price broke through the neckline of this pattern, came back to confirm the breakout, and all being well we could see a lift-off from here. Running contrary to this very bullish looking candle pattern, the Stochastic RSI at the bottom of the chart reveals that the indicator lines are breaking back down. If they are going to head back to the bottom, this would likely negate the inverse head and shoulders pattern. These indicators need to turn back around and the 50.00 level could provide the support where this takes place. Indicator lines need to be watched like a hawk.

Already over 500% higher in trading, the token still sits under $0.10‚Äîand is starting to attract attention. Among the projects that are being quietly amassed by whales is Remittix (RTX) . Why Whales Are Paying Attention to Low Cap Utility Tokens A few of the biggest crypto whales are presently shifting their attention away from big-cap positions to utility-based tokens. While Solana and Ethereum remain among the preferred choices due to robust infrastructure and network effects, they are no longer yielding the type of explosive growth seen in earlier cycles. This has opened space for smaller projects like Remittix that have practical-world usability and low barriers to entry in the market. These crypto projects normally possess features that align with tomorrow‚Äôs trend: low gas fees, fast cross-border payments, and compatibility with current finance systems. Solana is trading at $169.07 up by 2.92%, though its volume dropped by over 26%. Ethereum is also at $3,653.28, having appreciated by 1.82%, with its volume also decreasing significantly. This suggests consolidation to give the whales time to diversify into high-growth altcoins. Remittix: Crypto Utility That‚Äôs Solving Real Problems Remittix (RTX) is fast becoming a name to watch out for in 2025. With only $0.0895, the token has already amassed over $18.2 million, with 583 million+ tokens sold as part of its best crypto presale 2025. Remittix‚Äôs practical use in real life is what‚Äôs driving the buzz: crypto-to-bank money transfers in over 30 countries. Rather than creating buzz for the sake of buzz, Remittix is going to solve a monumental $19 trillion global payment problem. Through its upcoming Q3 2025 beta wallet release, users will be able to send mainstream cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and XRP directly into bank accounts. The wallet supports 40+ cryptocurrencies at launch, and has real-time FX conversion. Remittance providers, freelancers, businesses, and even cryptocurrency-first enterprises will benefit from rapid, low-cost cross-border payments. Real Utility and Long-Term Growth Potential Behind Remittix‚Äôs Rise With crypto staking, cross-chain compatibility, and a deflationary model, Remittix is already causing a stir in low cap crypto gems. The token is designed to increase in value over the long term for holders and is a Layer 2 Ethereum solution with real-world application‚Äînot speculation. What‚Äôs Fueling Remittix‚Äôs Early Surge: International Footprint: Crypto-to-bank transfers in 30+ countries Real-World Utility: Solves real payment problems 40% Token Bonus: Short-term promotion during presale Beta Launch in Q3: Wallet supports 40+ tokens As Solana and Ethereum continue to be part of the crypto world, so does the smart money anticipate.

While Solana has been making strong progress, Ethereum‚Äôs security image, decentralisation, and maturity of its ecosystem remain top dog. As both tokens rise to prominence, another promising crypto ‚Äî Remittix (RTX) ‚Äî is causing a stir for all the wrong reasons. Ethereum price dominance signals institutional confidence Institutional investors are firmly moving in the direction of Ethereum due to its history, depth of smart contracts, and utilisation to power DeFi projects, NFTs, and Layer 2 Ethereum alternatives. Ethereum‚Äôs price is $3,653.28, with an increase of 1.82%, and a market capitalisation of $440.86 billion. Although its trading volume decreased by 18.34%, belief in long-term holders continues to stand firm. On the other hand, Solana has surged 2.92% to $169.07, but still trails ETH in institutional trust. Solana‚Äôs lower trading volume, which is currently below more than 26%, and previous outages have made many fund managers wary, even as retail enthusiasm increases. Such institutional preference for ETH augurs for even more development opportunities for Ethereum-based tokens. All that being stated, the most impactful crypto innovations happen away from the spotlight ‚Äî and that‚Äôs where Remittix enters the picture. Remittix (RTX): crypto utility in real-world action While Ethereum Price continues to rise and Solana makes headlines, Remittix focuses on solving a vital pain point ‚Äî cross-border crypto-to-fiat transactions. For a mere $0.0895 per token, Remittix is a cross-chain DeFi solution that enables individuals to send cryptocurrencies directly into the ordinary bank accounts of 30+ countries. Far from the speculative model most altcoins follow. With over $18.2 million raised and selling 582 million+ tokens, Remittix is one of the quickest rising crypto presales available today. It‚Äôs not marketing itself as a meme or hype token, but as a crypto that solves real-world problems. The platform is offering a unique, frictionless crypto bridge ‚Äî ideal for freelancers, small businesses, and remittance senders who need speedy, low-cost cross-border transfers. The most important catalyst is the newly announced Remittix beta wallet, scheduled to launch in Q3 2025. The mobile-first wallet will include over 40 cryptocurrencies, provide real-time FX conversion, and provide direct fiat withdrawals ‚Äî the convenience of centralized exchanges with the liberty of DeFi. Why Remittix is getting attention in 2025 Even as Ethereum Price and Solana are still leading news cycle dominance, early-stage crypto investment communities are beginning to sit up and take notice of Remittix‚Äôs utility-first strategy. Remittix is getting attention because of its: $250,000 Giveaway: Now live for users that interact with the presale and referrals Utility-First Design: Crypto-to-bank transfers, competitive gas prices, and global accessibility Security Audited: Reviewed by CertiK, demonstrating project transparency and security This isn‚Äôt just hype; this is building operational infrastructure before token listings.

Introducing Bitcoin Swift: The Next Evolution in Crypto Wealth Building Bitcoin Swift (BTC3) is not just another digital asset. It‚Äôs a protocol designed to help users build wealth through innovative programmable incentives and PoY rewards. The project‚Äôs core mission is to empower users with a new way to earn, leveraging advanced technology and a community-driven approach.

With a focus on user empowerment, Bitcoin Swift is redefining what it means to participate in the crypto economy. Technical Brilliance: What Sets Bitcoin Swift Apart Diving into the technical side, Bitcoin Swift is built on a foundation of AI-powered energy efficiency and robust governance architecture. The protocol leverages advanced AI algorithms to optimize network operations, reducing energy consumption while maximizing performance. This isn‚Äôt just about being green; it‚Äôs about creating a sustainable ecosystem that can scale with demand. The governance architecture is another highlight. Bitcoin Swift introduces a decentralized, AI-governed DAO voting system, giving the community real power over the protocol‚Äôs evolution. This ensures that every major decision is made with user input, creating a truly democratic environment. Security is front and center, with Bitcoin Swift undergoing rigorous audits. The Solidproof Audit and Spywolf Audit have both given the protocol a clean bill of health, and the KYC process adds another layer of trust. Some leaked information suggests that the team is currently working on a third security audit with a well-known and reputable blockchain firm to ensure user safety and protocol integrity further. This relentless focus on security is a significant reason why so many are flocking to the project. AI-powered energy efficiency drives sustainable growth and network optimization. Decentralized governance architecture empowers users through AI-governed DAO voting. The Roadmap: What‚Äôs Next for Bitcoin Swift The future is mapped out with precision. Here‚Äôs a glimpse of what‚Äôs coming: Launch of programmable incentives and PoY rewards on Solana. Rollout of AI-powered smart contracts and privacy tools in 2026. Introduction of zk-SNARK ledger and on-chain AI sandbox. Full DID privacy integration and AI-governed DAO voting. Culmination with the BTC3 mainnet launch and institutional onboarding. Each milestone is designed to push the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible in crypto, ensuring that Bitcoin Swift remains at the forefront of innovation. Influencers and Community Hype: The Word on the Street The buzz around Bitcoin Swift is impossible to ignore. Influencers like Crypto Sister and Bull Run Angel have both highlighted the project, with detailed reviews breaking down why it‚Äôs attracting so much attention. Token Galaxy and Crypto Show are also talking about the momentum, and the community is echoing their excitement. The consensus is clear: Bitcoin Swift is the project to watch. Presale Frenzy: Final Hours of Stage 3 We‚Äôre now in the final hours of Stage 3 of the presale, with the current price at $3 and a launch price set at $15. The Stage 3 APY is a staggering 121%, and PoY rewards are distributed automatically at the end of each presale stage, giving early buyers instant protocol benefits. This is one of the shortest, most momentum-driven launches on the market, with only 1 day left before Stage 3 ends. The presale runs for just 64 days, ending on September 18, 2025, and BTC3 is making waves with over 1,600 active users and no signs of slowing down. Sources have leaked that the team is actively reaching out to major exchanges like MEXC, KuCoin, and LBank to arrange listings, which could send excitement to new heights. Final Verdict The journey of Bitcoin Swift, as it rapidly approaches the culmination of Stage 3 with its price soaring beyond $4, is a testament to its innovative design and the fervent support of its community. Bitcoin Swift, with its PoY rewards, AI efficiency, and strong governance, is redefining wealth building. Rigorous audits, a clear roadmap, and a hyped presale position make it the next big crypto opportunity.

Mutuum Finance is now in presale phase 6 at $0.035, a 16.17% increase from the last phase. Investors who buy now are locked in at a 71.43% ROI at launch. Mutuum Finance presale has surpassed over $14.1 million and has been bought by over 14,900 unique holders. While most headlines gravitate toward established players Cardano (ADA), the real story may be unfolding beneath the surface, where Mutuum Finance is attracting more attention. Cardano (ADA) Consolidates Near $0.74 While DeFi Narratives Shift Cardano is currently trading around $0.73, hovering just under a critical breakout zone near $0.75‚Äì$0.80. A bullish cup‚Äëand‚Äëhandle setup is forming on the charts, with analysts increasingly optimistic about a potential rally to $1.15, or possibly beyond if investor interest and ETF approval momentum continues to build. With speculative meme assets slowing and capital rotating toward utility-driven DeFi platforms, attention is also shifting toward projects like Mutuum Finance. Dual-Layer Decentralized Lending Protocol Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a noncustodial DeFi protocol. The project offers Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending with the main goal of achieving flexibility and efficiency. Peer-to-Contract platform utilizes the power of smart contracts to provide loans with minimal or no human intervention and the smart contracts modify themselves dynamically in accordance with the market. Peer-to-Peer architecture eliminates middlemen and enables borrowers and lenders to communicate directly. The model is highly convenient to manage risky assets like meme coins. Mutuum Finance Presale Enters Phase 6 Mutuum Finance is gaining lots of momentum as its presale stages are ending in a rush. The project is currently in stage 6 of the presale at $0.035. Its next stage price will increase by 14.29% to $0.04. Having launched at $0.06, stage 6 investors are looking at a return on investment of 71.43%. Demand for investment is increasing with the project already yielding more than $14.1 million and already having more than 14,900 token holders. Mutuum Finance Giveaways Mutuum Finance has initiated a $100,000 giveaway with the aim of growing its community. 10 investors have the opportunity to win $10,000 in MUTM tokens each. The giveaway not only invites new investors to the platform, but also indicates that the project is willing to go the extra mile to get a loyal and long-term user base. MUTM‚Äôs Peer-to-Contract lending utilizes a self-executing smart contract that automates the lending process without any human interaction, programmed to respond to the flow of market prices based on a floating interest rate. Peer-to-Peer model eliminates the intermediaries. It is even more common in meme coins as it has a possibility of having specified terms of a loan and flexibility based on the risk-bearing intention of a user. Mutuum Prepares Stablecoin Entry with New USD-Backed Digital Asset Mutuum Finance is developing a fully collateralized USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. The project is also audited by CertiK, a veteran blockchain security firm. Together with investors‚Äô assurance of code base integrity and transparency, the auditing process carried out ensures that the project will indeed develop a secure DeFi protocol. The project has also initiated a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program with CertiK. The four types of vulnerabilities to be rewarded are classified as critical, major, minor and low. Cardano (ADA) may be holding steady near $0.74, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is where many investors are spotting the next big move. Now in presale phase 6 at $0.035, with a launch price of $0.06, buyers are eyeing a 71.43% return.

While Storm was convicted on one felony count, conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business, the jury could not reach a unanimous decision on charges of conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to violate U.S. sanctions against North Korea. Legal experts say the DOJ‚Äôs decision on whether to proceed with a retrial is expected in the coming days. The unresolved charges center around allegations that Storm‚Äôs involvement in developing Tornado Cash facilitated criminal use of the protocol, including funds tied to state-sponsored North Korean hackers. Legal Fallout and Industry Concerns Storm‚Äôs trial has been closely watched by both the cryptocurrency industry and digital privacy advocates. Legal experts argue the case sets a critical precedent, not only for privacy-preserving blockchain tools but also for open-source developers in general. ‚ÄúThis is a sad day for DeFi,‚Äù said Jake Chervinsky, chief legal officer at Variant Fund, on X. He emphasized that Storm‚Äôs conviction under U.S. Code Section 1960‚Äîused to prosecute unlicensed money transmitters‚Äîposes a serious threat to the decentralized finance ecosystem. Attorney Zack Shapiro echoed similar concerns, calling the outcome ‚Äúpretty depressing‚Äù but noted that at least the more severe charges‚Äîmoney laundering and sanctions violations‚Äîdid not result in immediate convictions. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good the draconian sentencing is off the table, for now,‚Äù he posted on X. Tornado Cash Faces Broader Legal Struggle Tornado Cash, a crypto mixing service, has long been in the crosshairs of U.S. authorities. In 2022, the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) imposed sanctions on the protocol, citing its alleged use in laundering over $7 billion worth of cryptocurrency. This included funds linked to North Korean hackers tied to cyberattacks and theft. However, in a surprise legal victory for the crypto industry, a U.S. court overturned those OFAC sanctions in January 2025. The ruling gave a boost to privacy-preserving protocols and open-source software advocates, though the Storm case remains a complex legal battleground. If the DOJ decides to retry the unresolved counts, the outcome could have long-lasting effects on how decentralized technologies and their developers are regulated in the United States.

BASE network is one of the popular chains for builders to create big ecosystems like Brett. One new name that‚Äôs generating curiosity right now is BlockSack. Built on the BASE network, BlockSack enters the crypto presale 2025 scene with a bold, meme-fueled approach that‚Äôs hard to ignore. At its heart is $BSACK, a token positioning itself in the new crypto token presale category with real in-game utility. As investors scan the crypto presale list for the next big utility-based token, BlockSack‚Äôs mix of decentralized gaming, NFT minting, and staking is making it a coin presale worth paying attention to. Let‚Äôs break down why $BSACK is being talked about in some corners as one of the best crypto presales to buy right now. What Is $BSACK and Why Building On BASE Network Matters BlockSack runs on BASE, an Ethereum Layer-2 chain built for speed, low fees, and seamless on-chain interaction. It‚Äôs become a magnet for projects building high-performance dApps without losing decentralization. $BSACK taps into that strength. This isn‚Äôt your average meme token. It claims to be the genesis point of all chains, meme meets mythology. While this may sound wild, it sets the stage for a tongue-in-cheek culture project that doesn‚Äôt ignore real blockchain use cases. $BSACK isn‚Äôt just part of another crypto coin on presale. It aims to serve multiple functions, fueling games, staking, NFT minting, and ecosystem governance. For anyone scanning crypto presale projects that aim to offer more than a quick flip, this positions BSACK in a unique category. With staking rewards tied to community activity and a plan to build across different use cases, it reflects the shift toward more utility-based pre-sale cryptocurrency assets. BlockSack‚Äôs Bold Ambition Web3 gaming has long promised innovation but often delivered fragmented, costly experiences. BlockSack enters with a different tone, part parody, part protocol, with real potential to reshape how Base gaming tokens behave in DeFi-linked ecosystems. At the center is its ""Sperm-Chain"", a humorous term for a serious concept: fully onchain gameplay with real-time interaction, rewards, and token-based incentives. While meme-heavy on the outside, BlockSack‚Äôs roadmap hints at gamified staking, player-owned NFT assets, and a native gaming platform designed for speed and sticky liquidity. This direction sets it apart from typical new token presale entrants. While many projects claim to be play-to-earn, few offer a complete toolset at launch. BlockSack‚Äôs potential lies in how it connects meme culture with real incentives. That‚Äôs why some investors are putting it on their shortlists of top crypto presales , not for the memes alone, but for its layered approach to Base-based gaming economies. What Makes BlockSack Stand Out Even in a sea of crypto presale coins, BlockSack isn‚Äôt blending in. Its standout features include an uncensored NSFW NFT minting hub, meme-wrapped staking incentives, and a DEX built for fast swaps within the BASE ecosystem. Instead of just being another crypto ICO presale with vague roadmaps, BlockSack focuses on active utility. The BSACK token can be used for staking, in-game rewards, NFT royalties, and accessing liquidity pools, giving holders multiple ways to engage. Add a trading bot, social-fi rewards, and AI-guided onboarding, and you get a meme project that‚Äôs more than just jokes. Early Access, Real Utility, and Cultural Momentum BlockSack‚Äôs presale launched today, marking Stage 1 of its journey. While it‚Äôs early days, its presence in the crypto pre sales landscape feels refreshingly original. This isn‚Äôt financial advice, nor a suggestion to ape in, but for those researching the best crypto presale options for 2025, BlockSack lands somewhere between meme madness and meaningful infrastructure. If you‚Äôre browsing the presale crypto tokens category or keeping a close eye on crypto presale 2025 candidates, $BSACK might offer something different, especially if the BASE chain continues to attract builders and communities.

49685487,https://invezz.com/?p=2829582,1754559273,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,AAVE users at risk as scammers use Google ads to promote fake DeFi website,https://invezz.com/news/2025/08/07/aave-users-at-risk-as-scammers-use-google-ads-to-promote-fake-defi-website/,"Crypto scammers have once again resorted to using Google ads to promote phishing sites, this time targeting decentralised finance protocol Aave with a fake website designed to drain users‚Äô wallets. On Thursday, August 7, blockchain security firm PeckShield raised the alarm about a fake ad impersonating Aave that appeared at the top of Google search results. Fake ad displayed as top result. Source: PeckSheildAlert on X. According to the firm‚Äôs security alert, the malicious ad linked to a phishing domain ‚Äî aaxe.co.com ‚Äî which mimicked Aave‚Äôs legitimate website in an attempt to deceive users. PeckShield urged the crypto community not to interact with the ad and to verify the authenticity of DeFi websites before engaging. As of presstime, the Aave team had yet to acknowledge the issue. Meanwhile, the malicious ad was no longer visible when looking up Aave on Google. Are AAVE users at risk? Yes, such scams, although not new, pose significant risks to any cryptocurrency enthusiast who is not careful enough to verify the web address. The scam works by redirecting unsuspecting users to the fake Aave site to access and drain digital assets from connected wallets, especially as the fraudulent interface closely mirrors that of the real Aave platform, with only subtle differences that can be spotted on thorough examination. Phishing attacks like this rely on deception rather than brute force. Instead of requiring victims to reveal private keys or passwords, attackers manipulate them into approving transactions that hand over wallet permissions. Once a user signs such a transaction, the smart contract grants control to the scammer‚Äôs address, enabling them to transfer funds out without further authorisation. This attack vector is especially dangerous in the decentralised finance (DeFi) space, where transactions are irreversible and user protection mechanisms are limited. For an average Aave user, falling for such a scam could mean the loss of funds supplied as liquidity, collateral, or borrowed tokens, all without any recourse for recovery. Moreover, malicious approvals can persist indefinitely if not manually revoked, exposing wallets to future risks. Scammers continue targeting crypto users via Google For Google, this is not a novel problem. Over the past years, there have been several recorded incidents of such ads popping up when a user looks up a legitimate cryptocurrency project on Google search. For instance, last month, a DeFi user lost over $1.23 million in Uniswap NFTs after interacting with a fake site that appeared as a top Google ad result. In some cases, scammers have even impersonated tools like revoke.cash ‚Äî targeting users who were already trying to recover from earlier attacks, effectively turning past victims into victims again. Why hasn‚Äôt Google addressed crypto scams? Google hasn‚Äôt been sitting on the sidelines and has taken several steps to curb abuse of its ad platform in the form of lawsuits and bans. In early 2024, the tech giant sued two Chinese nationals, Yunfeng Sun and Hongnam Cheung, for promoting fake crypto investments through apps on the Google Play Store. Google claimed it had disabled 90 fraudulent apps linked to the pair, which had accumulated nearly 100,000 downloads. The year before, Google reported blocking 5.5 billion ads and suspending 12.7 million advertiser accounts for violations related to scams and misrepresentation. The company also introduced a ‚ÄúLimited Ads Serving‚Äù policy to restrict reach for advertisers lacking an established track record. However, despite these efforts, scammers continue to find ways around Google‚Äôs filters . As such, experts urge users to exercise caution when interacting with links in search results, especially sponsored links related to crypto platforms or wallet services.

A prominent trader, known as AguilaTrades on Hyperliquid, has made headlines by opening substantial Bitcoin and Ethereum long positions, signaling a strong bullish sentiment in the market. What Are These Massive Bitcoin Ethereum Longs? Recently, an on-chain analyst, @ai_9684xtpa on X, highlighted a staggering move by Hyperliquid whale AguilaTrades. This trader deposited an impressive 4.6 million USDC as margin, setting the stage for significant Bitcoin Ethereum longs . Specifically, AguilaTrades opened a 40x leverage position on Bitcoin, acquiring 530.75 BTC at a price of $114,856. Simultaneously, a 25x leverage position was initiated for Ethereum, securing 10,000 ETH at $3,706. These combined leveraged positions total an astonishing $98.29 million. Such a substantial commitment underscores a strong conviction in the upward trajectory of both Bitcoin and Ethereum. As of the initial report, these positions already showed an unrealized gain of $308,000, indicating immediate positive momentum. Why Does Hyperliquid Trading Matter? Hyperliquid trading is a decentralized perpetual exchange known for its high leverage options and deep liquidity. The platform allows traders to execute large orders efficiently. When a ‚Äúwhale‚Äù like AguilaTrades chooses Hyperliquid for such a significant move, it often signals confidence in the platform‚Äôs capabilities and the broader market outlook. This particular trade showcases the potential for immense gains‚Äîor losses‚Äîthat come with high leverage. For market observers, tracking such significant moves on platforms like Hyperliquid provides valuable insights into the sentiment of major players. It helps gauge where institutional or large individual capital might be flowing. It‚Äôs a transparent look at conviction. Understanding Large Crypto Trades and Their Impact When a single entity executes such large crypto trades , it can have ripple effects across the market. While not always a direct cause for price movements, these significant positions can influence market sentiment and attract attention from other traders. They might interpret such actions as a bullish signal, potentially leading to follow-on buying pressure. Key aspects of these trades include: Leverage: The use of 40x on BTC and 25x on ETH amplifies both potential profits and risks. Scale: Nearly $100 million in combined positions is a substantial sum, even for the crypto market. Unrealized Gain: The immediate $308,000 gain provides an early validation of the trade, though market conditions can change rapidly. Such moves are closely watched by those engaged in on-chain analysis , as they provide a transparent look into the actions of major market participants. What On-Chain Analysis Reveals About These Positions? The ability to track these trades through on-chain analysis is crucial. On-chain data provides transparency into wallet movements, exchange deposits, and large transactions, offering a unique perspective that traditional markets lack. In this case, the analyst @ai_9684xtpa was able to pinpoint the exact margin deposited, the specific assets, and the leverage used by AguilaTrades. This level of detail helps the community understand the conviction behind such significant crypto whale positions . It also allows for a more informed discussion about potential market trends. While a single whale‚Äôs actions do not guarantee future price movements, they often serve as a strong indicator of sentiment among sophisticated traders. These insights are invaluable for anyone looking to understand the dynamics of the crypto market. What Does This Mean for the Market? AguilaTrades‚Äô substantial Bitcoin Ethereum longs indicate a strong belief in continued upward momentum for these leading cryptocurrencies. While this is a single instance of a large trade, it contributes to the overall narrative of bullish sentiment, particularly if other whales follow suit. It underscores the potential for significant capital to flow into the market, driving prices higher. However, it is vital to remember the inherent risks of leveraged trading. High leverage means that even small price movements against the position can lead to rapid liquidations. Therefore, while intriguing, these trades also serve as a reminder of the volatility and risks present in the cryptocurrency space. In summary, AguilaTrades‚Äô audacious $98 million Bitcoin and Ethereum long positions on Hyperliquid represent a bold statement of confidence in the crypto market. This significant move, highlighted by meticulous on-chain analysis, offers a fascinating glimpse into the strategies of a prominent crypto whale. It underscores the potential for substantial gains while also reminding us of the amplified risks associated with high-leverage large crypto trades .

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Who is AguilaTrades? AguilaTrades is identified as a ‚ÄúHyperliquid whale,‚Äù meaning a large-scale trader operating on the Hyperliquid decentralized perpetual exchange, known for executing significant crypto trades. What does it mean to open ‚Äúlong positions‚Äù on BTC and ETH? Opening a long position means a trader is betting that the price of the asset (Bitcoin or Ethereum in this case) will increase. If the price goes up, the trader profits. What is ‚Äúleverage‚Äù in crypto trading? Leverage allows traders to open positions larger than their initial capital by borrowing funds. For example, 40x leverage means a trader can control a position 40 times the size of their margin deposit. While it amplifies potential profits, it also significantly increases the risk of liquidation. How was this information discovered?

On-chain analysis involves examining data directly from the blockchain to track transactions, wallet activity, and large trades. Does this trade guarantee Bitcoin and Ethereum prices will rise?

When and How Much Will the Fed Cut?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/minneapolis-fed-president-neel-kashkaris-special-remarks-when-and-how-much-will-the-fed-cut/,"The Fed continues to keep interest rates steady despite US President Donald Trump's persistent demands for interest rate cuts. Expectations for the first interest rate cut of 2025 intensified in September, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell citing economic uncertainty stemming from tariffs as the reason. At this point, while some FED members also support a rate cut in September, the last person to support a September rate cut was Minneapolis FED President Neel Kashkari. Speaking on CNBC's Squawk Box, Kashkari said the Fed may soon be forced to cut interest rates as signs of a slowing economy grow stronger. ‚ÄúThe economy is slowing, which means adjustments may be appropriate in the near term.‚Äù At this point, Kashkari stated that two 25 basis point interest rate cuts by the end of 2025 would be appropriate, adding, ‚ÄúIt seems reasonable to me.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe latest data shows that the real underlying economy is slowing down. The economy is slowing down. While the impact of tariffs on inflation is still unclear, how long can we wait before the impact of tariffs becomes clear? Although uncertainty continues, interest rate cuts may begin in the short term. If inflation starts to rise because of the tariffs, the Fed could then stop cutting rates or even start raising them. Like Kashkari, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly also thinks two rate cuts this year are probably appropriate. *This is not investment advice.

The global tension, largely provoked by ongoing geopolitical conflicts and trade hurdles has surely had an impact, while the state of the US economy also seems to be a fundamental consideration behind the recent market moves in crypto. Bitcoin Price Flirts With $115,000 The past 24 hours saw BTC‚Äôs price increase by around 0.8% and attack the $115,000 level yet again. The sellers attempted a push below $114,000, as CryptoPotato reported in yesterday‚Äôs market watch, but were unsuccessful. Regardless, the volatility has been relatively minimal, particularly when speaking about Bitcoin, which is also reflected in the liquidations over the discussed period. BTC accounted for $18 million, while ETH took center stage and accounted for $50 million worth of liquidated positions. Data from Coinglass shows that the total number is around $146 million, which is less than what‚Äôs typical, highlighting subdued trading activity across the derivatives markets over the past 24 hours. It appears that the markets are consolidating and waiting for some sort of further clarity on the matter of tariffs, as well as the direction of the US Federal Reserve policy in regards to interest rates. Polymarket currently indicates a 79% chance of a 25 bps rate cut in September.

However, from the large caps, there is nothing too extraordinary. As mentioned, ETH went through some volatility and, fortunately for the bulls, it resolved to the upside, gaining around 2.6% in the interim. DOGE, XLM, SUI, SOL, LINK, BNB, and pretty much all of the other leading altcoins are also gaining between 1% and 5%. Out of the top 100 coins, the best performer is POL, which is up by 9%, followed by Ethena (ENA) with 8.3% and Mantle (MNT) with 5.8%.

Key Takeaways: DL Holdings is raising $83.2M to fund blockchain and crypto ventures through a share placement deal. The move dilutes 13.6% of existing shares, triggering an 8.4% stock drop. Funds will support tokenization, bitcoin mining, stablecoins, and crypto licenses in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong-listed financial services firm disclosed a placing and subscription agreement in a stock exchange filing. Under the deal, selling shareholders will offload shares to at least six investors at HK$2.95 per share via placing agents, and then immediately subscribe to an equivalent number of newly issued shares at the same price. DL Holdings Dilutes 13.6% of Shares in Blockchain-Focused Deal The transaction covers roughly 13.6% of DL Holdings‚Äô issued share capital, which will shrink to just under 12% post-issuance. Proceeds will be allocated across several blockchain initiatives. Around 30% is earmarked for tokenization of real-world assets and other strategic investments. Another 15% will support bitcoin mining operations and reserves, while 8% will go toward developing digital asset and stablecoin businesses. The firm also plans to invest 7% in acquiring crypto trading licenses in Hong Kong. Remaining funds are set to bolster IT infrastructure, support ETF development, invest in U.S. real estate, and cover working capital needs. Despite the bullish bet on blockchain, investors reacted cautiously. DL Holdings shares slid 8.4% to HK$3.07 by mid-Thursday trading, according to Yahoo Finance data. Venture capital investment in the crypto sector rebounded strongly in Q2 2025, with companies raising a total of $10.03 billion, the highest quarterly figure since Q1 2022. Q2 Closes as The Strongest Fundraising Quarter in Years June marked a record-breaking close to Q2, with $5.14B raised, making it the strongest fundraising quarter in recent years.

Other notable companies securing capital were Securitize, Kalshi, Auradine, ZenMEV, and Digital Asset, highlighting growing interest across diverse crypto projects. Pure Crypto‚Äôs First Fund Soars Nearly 1,000% As reported, Pure Crypto, a relatively quiet player in the digital asset space based outside Chicago, has turned heads after revealing its flagship fund has surged nearly 1,000% since its inception in 2018. What began as a crypto experiment within a traditional wealth management firm is now a $60 million fund, backed by a sharp strategy and family office capital. Founded by Jeremy Boynton, who also runs Laureate Wealth Management, and managed alongside partner Zachary Lindquist, Pure Crypto has grown into a $100 million crypto-focused fund of funds. The duo is now preparing to raise capital for their fourth fund, which they say will ride what they see as the final wave of venture-style returns in crypto. ‚ÄúWe think this is maybe the last hurrah in the venture capital-esque nature of crypto returns,‚Äù Boynton said. As regulation solidifies, such as the recent stablecoin bill signed into law by former President Donald Trump, and major corporations explore integrating digital currencies, they see the wild west days of outsized gains coming to a close.

This surge highlights a significant milestone for the blockchain, signaling its robust health and expanding utility. Indeed, the overall Ethereum network activity is currently at an all-time high, capturing the attention of investors and developers worldwide. What‚Äôs Driving the Surge in Ethereum Transactions? Ethereum‚Äôs recent performance is truly remarkable. On August 5, the network processed an astounding 1.74 million daily transactions. This figure surpassed the previous record of 1.65 million, set back on May 12, 2021, as reported by The Block. Moreover, July saw a new monthly record with 46.67 million transactions on the Ethereum network, underscoring the growing demand for Ethereum transactions . Several key factors contribute to this impressive surge. Vincent Liu, CIO of Kronos Research, a prominent crypto trading firm, points to two main catalysts: Clarity in Regulations: The increasing clarity surrounding crypto regulations impact in the United States provides a more stable and predictable environment for investors and developers. This reduced uncertainty encourages greater participation. Institutional Adoption: Growing institutional adoption plays a crucial role. More large entities are exploring and implementing Ethereum treasury strategies.

This significant capital inflow represents more than just a boost for Ethereum‚Äîit acts as a powerful catalyst for the entire decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, creating fresh opportunities for projects poised to benefit from increased market participation. Among these emerging opportunities, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as a rising star attracting attention from whales and savvy investors alike, especially considering its current presale price of just $0.035 and the enormous upside potential that lies ahead. Ethereum (ETH) ETF Inflows Hit $500M Ethereum (ETH) spot ETFs recorded $533.8 million in net inflows in late July, marking their third-highest single-day haul, contributing to a 13-day streak totaling $3.63 billion, per SoSoValue data. BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) led with $426.22 million, while Fidelity‚Äôs FETH added $35.01 million, pushing total ETF assets past $10 billion, or ~4% of ETH‚Äôs market cap. ETH‚Äôs price climbed to ~$3,871, up 10% weekly, but faces $4,000 resistance, with support at $3,824. Whale accumulation, including a $114 million buy by wallet 0xF436, and a 40% surge in ETF-held ETH (4.95M ETH) signal strong institutional demand. However, $2.2 billion in staking withdrawals and muted Pectra upgrade sentiment could cap gains. A breakout above $4,100 may target $4,500, but macro uncertainties like U.S. tariffs pose risks. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): A Lending Platform Tailored for All Risk Profiles Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs strength will lie in its versatile dual lending system, designed to cater to different investor appetites. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model will target stable and blue-chip cryptocurrencies, enabling steady yield generation with reliable collateral. For example, lending $18,000 worth of USDT into the platform at a competitive 16% annual percentage yield (APY) will result in $2,880 earned over a year. Borrowers will also benefit by locking collateral to access loans; depositing $1,200 in Solana (SOL) will allow a borrower to draw $900 in DAI at a 75% loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, optimizing liquidity while maintaining healthy risk parameters. On the other end of the spectrum, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending mechanism will offer higher risk and reward dynamics. This feature will facilitate direct lending between users for more speculative tokens like BONK and FLOKI, where borrowers and lenders will negotiate terms without pooled liquidity. This model will empower adventurous traders to leverage their assets with greater flexibility while offering lenders enhanced returns on riskier assets, tapping into a niche that many platforms overlook. The platform‚Äôs flexibility will ensure that both conservative and aggressive investors can engage with Mutuum Finance (MUTM), making it an attractive project for a wide range of market participants ‚Äî including large whales who will be on the lookout for undervalued assets with strong fundamentals. Presale Momentum and Future Catalysts for Growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs presale phase has generated robust interest, with over $14.1 million raised and 12% of the token supply already sold to more than 14,900 holders. This active community base underscores the growing trust in the project‚Äôs vision and technology. Beyond raising capital, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has developed a revenue-sharing model that sets it apart. The platform will allocate a portion of its income to repurchase MUTM tokens from the market, which are then redistributed as rewards to stakers of mtTokens‚Äîthe platform‚Äôs interest-bearing tokens representing user deposits. This mechanism creates a sustainable cycle of demand and incentivizes holding, directly benefiting long-term investors. Security remains a cornerstone of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs credibility. The project is currently undergoing a thorough audit by CertiK, one of the blockchain industry‚Äôs most respected security firms. Requested on February 25, 2025, and revised as recently as May 20, 2025, the audit includes both manual reviews and static analysis, reflecting Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs commitment to transparency and safety. In addition, the platform has launched a bug bounty program offering rewards between $200 and $2,000 to ethical hackers who help identify vulnerabilities. These measures ensure that investors‚Äô funds remain secure while enhancing confidence in the project‚Äôs future. From an investment standpoint, early backers are already seeing meaningful returns. A participant who purchased MUTM tokens at $0.025 in Phase 4 has realized a 40% gain as the price moves closer to the current Phase 6 level of $0.035. Looking ahead, the expected listing price of $0.06 on major exchanges will elevate these gains to 140%. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs roadmap includes key milestones such as the beta launch of its platform, which will provide users real-world access to its lending features, fueling further demand for MUTM tokens. Exchange listings are set to include top-tier platforms like Binance and Kraken, which will significantly increase token visibility and liquidity. Combined with Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs integration of Layer-2 solutions to enhance transaction speeds and reduce fees, these developments will position MUTM as a leading DeFi token with substantial growth potential. Market analysts project the token‚Äôs value reaching $1 by 2026, driven by a combination of institutional interest, user adoption, and platform revenue growth.

Crypto Market Recovers, Flipping Into Greed Mode ‚Äì Presales Gearing up for Altcoin Season August 7, 2025 ‚Ä¢ 10:00 UTC Crypto has had a rough past week, with most of the top assets, including Bitcoin, in the red . However, things are turning around for investors, with all the top 10 assets up over the past 24h. The overall crypto market cap is up 1%, currently sitting at $3.76T.

Solana Meme Coins to Boom August 7, 2025 ‚Ä¢ 10:00 UTC Solana looks ready for a 100%+ rally, according to a recent report from The Coin Republic. Currently trading just above $169 after a -35% dip from January, $SOL is mirroring historical trends similar to its 2024 rally. The same bullish fractal pattern forming today had rallied $SOL 70% in 2024. If history does repeat, the coin could hit a new all-time high of $340 in the near future. MACD indicators already point at growing bullish momentum, and $SOL is aiming to establish new support levels at $177 and $189, crypto analyst Ali Martinez stated . With Solana being the de facto network for meme coins , the growing bullish sentiment could also trickle down into other on-chain tokens. In fact, blockchain data shows a growing number of transactions going towards meme coin ICOs like Snorter Token ($SNORT) , which has already raised $2.8M+ in the pre-market.

The Trump tariffs accounted for an estimated annual cost of $9.5 billion. The Japanese automaker has effectively revised its yearly profit forecast down by 600 billion yen to 3.2 trillion yen. The automaker anticipates a 1.4 trillion yen ($9.5 billion) annual hit from levies imposed by the U.S. on product exports/imports. It announced a quarterly profit of 841 billion yen ($5.7 billion), down from 1.33 trillion yen a year ago. Despite a 3% increase in global sales, the automobile company was slapped with a reduction in operating profits by 450 billion yen ($3 billion), resulting from Trump tariffs alone. Toyota revises its annual profit forecast down Toyota revised its annual operating profit down by 600 billion yen to 3.2 trillion yen following the anticipated $9.5 billion yearly hit from Trump tariffs. The automaker cited unfavorable exchange rates and rising operational costs in Japan as the key drivers for weak earnings during Q2. The company press argued further that despite the challenges, it has continued to invest comprehensively, improve sales, and cut costs. The company could not avoid the decline despite strong global demand in Q1 of 2025. The Japanese automaker recorded a 7.4% year-over-year increase in international sales. It sold 5.5 million units compared to 5.1 million units last year. Retail sales recorded 2.4 million units, up from 2.2 million last year. Notable regions that drove the sales included Japan, North America, and Europe. The U.S imposed a 25% import tariff in April on Japanese vehicles, highly impacting Toyota and Honda. According to Japan‚Äôs Ministry of Trade data , Japanese vehicle exports reduced by 25.3% year on year in June, despite a 4.6% rise in export volumes to the U.S. Some analysts have said the divergence proves how automakers have been forced to take tariff-related costs by squeezing their margins, even though sales continue to grow. According to the Japanese customs data , auto exports to America form a crucial part of the Japanese economy, accounting for 24% of the total vehicle exports in 2024. Toyota offers dealership access to the U.S competition in a tariff relief bid Toyota has offered to increase its shipments to the U.S. and assist American competitors with dealership access to the Japanese markets to ease tariff pressure. The initiative coincides with the ongoing negotiations between the U.S. and Japan to reduce tariffs to 15%. The automaker is still uncertain about when the reduced rate will take effect. The Japanese automaker based its profit forecasts on the assumption that Trump will cut the levies on imports to 12.5% starting this month. The levies remain at 15%, straining the automaker‚Äôs margins even further and triggering another decline in the annual profit forecasts. Some analysts have revealed that Toyota is among the most hit companies by the Trump tariffs. In an exclusive interview with CNBC, Abhik Mukherjee, an automotive analyst at Counterpoint Research, revealed that Japanese automakers faced significant profit pressure earlier this year due to elevated U.S. import tariffs and a stronger yen. He added that despite higher vehicle export volumes to the U.S., the higher costs from tariffs squeezed the automaker‚Äôs margins. Mukherjee believes that Japanese automakers still face margin reductions from the strong yen and high operation costs. However, he said the 15% reduced rate plus pricing adjustments could stabilize the annual earnings. He added that Japanese automakers have a competitive advantage over competitors in the NAFTA region (including Canada, Mexico, and the U.S.), who still face higher tariffs.

Recent data reveals that the amount of Ethereum (ETH) held on major centralized exchanges has dropped to its lowest point since 2016. This significant decline prompts us to explore what this trend signifies for the broader crypto market and the future of ETH. Understanding the Historic Drop in Ethereum Exchange Holdings According to a report by DL News, citing data from CryptoQuant, the total ETH supply on centralized exchanges now stands at a mere 18.8 million. This figure marks a substantial reduction of over 33% from its peak of 28 million ETH in mid-2022. Such a sharp decrease indicates a fundamental change in how investors are managing their Ethereum assets. Significant Decline: From 28 million ETH in mid-2022 to 18.8 million currently. Lowest Level Since 2016: This indicates a long-term trend rather than a short-term fluctuation. Data Source: The insights are drawn from reputable analytics firm CryptoQuant, highlighting the trustworthiness of the data. This metric is crucial because centralized exchanges often serve as a barometer for short-term trading sentiment. A lower supply on these platforms can suggest less immediate selling pressure. Why Are Centralized Exchanges Seeing Less ETH Supply? Several factors contribute to this noticeable reduction in Ethereum exchange holdings . Investors are increasingly choosing to move their ETH off exchanges for various reasons, reflecting evolving strategies and confidence in the network. Increased Staking: A significant portion of ETH is being locked up in Ethereum‚Äôs Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. Staking ETH removes it from active circulation and exchange trading. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Growth: Many users are moving ETH into DeFi protocols for lending, borrowing, or yield farming, which often requires self-custody or interaction with non-custodial wallets. Long-Term Conviction: A desire for greater security and a belief in Ethereum‚Äôs long-term potential encourages self-custody. Investors are opting to hold their ETH in personal wallets, away from the immediate reach of exchanges. Regulatory Concerns: Some investors might be wary of potential regulatory actions affecting centralized platforms, prompting them to take control of their assets. This trend suggests a growing maturity within the crypto market , as participants become more comfortable with self-custody and decentralized applications. What Does This Mean for Ethereum Price and Market Dynamics? The dwindling ETH supply on centralized exchanges can have several implications for the Ethereum price and overall market dynamics. When less supply is readily available for sale, it can create upward pressure on prices, assuming demand remains constant or increases. Reduced Selling Pressure: Less ETH on exchanges means fewer tokens are immediately available to be sold, potentially mitigating large sell-offs. Supply Shock Potential: If demand for ETH suddenly surges, the limited supply on exchanges could lead to rapid price increases. Investor Sentiment Shift: The move to self-custody signals a strong bullish sentiment, as investors are less likely to sell their holdings if they are not on an exchange. However, it is important to remember that the Ethereum price is influenced by many factors, including overall market sentiment, macroeconomic conditions, and network developments. While reduced exchange supply is a positive indicator, it is not the sole determinant of price action. Embracing Self-Custody: The Future of Ethereum Holdings? The dramatic drop in Ethereum exchange holdings underscores a significant trend towards self-custody and decentralization. This shift empowers individual users with greater control over their assets, aligning with the core principles of blockchain technology. Actionable Insights for Investors: Consider Self-Custody: Explore hardware wallets or secure software wallets for long-term ETH holdings. Research Staking Opportunities: If you hold ETH, investigate staking options to earn rewards while contributing to network security. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on on-chain metrics and broader crypto market trends to understand the evolving landscape. While self-custody offers benefits like enhanced security and control, it also carries the responsibility of managing private keys safely. Losing access to your wallet means losing your funds permanently. Therefore, proper education and caution are paramount. The plummeting Ethereum exchange holdings to levels not seen since 2016 is a powerful indicator of changing investor behavior and a growing embrace of Ethereum‚Äôs decentralized ethos. This trend reflects a maturing ecosystem where users are increasingly comfortable taking direct control of their assets, moving them off centralized exchanges for long-term holding, staking, or participation in DeFi. This historic shift could have profound implications for future Ethereum price movements and the overall stability of the crypto market , signaling a more robust and self-reliant community. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Why are Ethereum exchange holdings decreasing? Ethereum exchange holdings are decreasing primarily because investors are moving their ETH off centralized platforms for various reasons, including staking, participation in Decentralized Finance (DeFi), long-term conviction, and a preference for self-custody to enhance security and control over their assets. What does a drop in ETH supply on exchanges mean for the Ethereum price? A drop in ETH supply on exchanges generally indicates reduced selling pressure. When less ETH is readily available for sale on trading platforms, it can create a supply shock, potentially leading to upward pressure on the Ethereum price if demand remains strong or increases. Is it safer to hold ETH off centralized exchanges? Holding ETH off centralized exchanges, in a personal wallet (self-custody), offers greater control and can be safer from risks like exchange hacks or regulatory interventions. However, it also means you are solely responsible for securing your private keys; losing them results in permanent loss of funds. How does this trend relate to decentralization in the crypto market? This trend strongly aligns with the principles of decentralization. By moving ETH off centralized exchanges, users are opting for direct ownership and interaction with the blockchain, reducing reliance on intermediaries and fostering a more decentralized and resilient crypto market ecosystem. Where is the ETH moving to if not on exchanges? The ETH moved off exchanges is primarily going into personal wallets (both software and hardware wallets) for self-custody, being locked up in staking contracts on the Ethereum network, or being deployed into various Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols for yield generation and other services.

While this document may read like a technical critique, the underlying message is clear: traditional banking groups fear the structural shift Ripple and XRP represent. Submitted on August 4, 2025, to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the ICBA‚Äôs objection targets Ripple‚Äôs proposed subsidiary, Ripple National Trust Bank (RNTB). The bank, if approved, would work primarily with RLUSD, Ripple‚Äôs stablecoin, designed to operate with the XRP Ledger (XRPL). The letter warns that such a model would ‚Äúfunctionally accept deposits‚Äù and perform services outside the scope of what national trust banks were intended to do. However, one community member explained the ICBA‚Äôs stance, writing , ‚ÄúSeven pages to say ‚ÄúWe are afraid‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù Seven pages to say ""We are afraid‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"" ‚Äî Natoman (@Natoman9) August 6, 2025 Concerns Disguised as Technical Objections The ICBA‚Äôs arguments rest largely on legal and procedural concerns. The group claims RNTB‚Äôs activities would violate the National Bank Act by acting as a de facto deposit-taking institution, offering RLUSD to retail users in a way that closely resembles a deposit. They argue that stablecoins like RLUSD pose risks to banking system stability by incentivizing capital flight from traditional deposits. It references a Treasury report that estimated $6.6 trillion could move to stablecoins if yields are allowed. Ripple is also accused of leveraging the trust bank structure to bypass full Federal Reserve oversight, as trust banks are not subject to the Bank Holding Company Act (BHCA). The letter claims this weakens the system‚Äôs regulatory integrity and threatens consumer protections. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Real Issue The ICBA letter extends beyond regulatory concerns. It shows discomfort with Ripple‚Äôs growing role in digital finance and its effort to make XRP a key part of institutional payments and stablecoin infrastructure. While the letter cites Ripple‚Äôs past issues with the SEC and FinCEN, it also suggests that Ripple‚Äôs strategy threatens the market position of traditional banks. A Preemptive Strike Against XRP and RLUSD in Banking The ICBA is urging the OCC to reject Ripple‚Äôs trust bank charter and to open formal rulemaking. This move aims to prevent crypto assets like RLUSD from entering the banking system under lighter regulation. Traditional financial institutions are afraid that XRP and RLUSD will dominate the banking system. This is why ICBA attempts to block Ripple out. Ripple has not yet responded, but the message from the ICBA is clear. Established institutions view XRP‚Äôs expanding role as a challenge they are not willing to ignore.

The Bank of England recently made headlines with a crucial Bank of England rate cut , lowering interest rates by 25 basis points to 4%. This move, as reported by Watcher Guru on X, marks a notable shift in the UK‚Äôs monetary policy. For those invested in digital assets, understanding the ripple effects of such central bank decisions is more important than ever. What does this mean for your crypto portfolio? What Exactly Happened with UK Interest Rates ? The Bank of England, the central bank of the United Kingdom, announced a reduction in its benchmark interest rate. They cut the rate by 25 basis points (bps), bringing it down from 4.25% to 4%. A basis point is simply one-hundredth of a percentage point, so 25 basis points equals 0.25%. Why the Cut? Central banks typically lower interest rates to stimulate economic growth. Cheaper borrowing costs can encourage businesses to invest and consumers to spend, potentially boosting the economy. A Shift in Stance: This decision signals a change in the Bank of England‚Äôs approach, moving away from the rate-hiking cycle seen in recent times, which was primarily aimed at combating inflation. This development is not just about traditional finance; it has far-reaching implications that can touch various markets, including the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. Understanding the Economic Policy Changes When a major central bank like the Bank of England adjusts its rates, it creates waves across the global financial landscape. This particular economic policy change could influence everything from mortgage rates to business loans, ultimately affecting the overall liquidity and investor sentiment. Lower interest rates generally make traditional savings less attractive, as the returns on deposits decrease. Consequently, investors might seek higher yields in other asset classes. This search for yield can sometimes lead capital into riskier, yet potentially more rewarding, investments. Moreover, a looser monetary policy often means more money flowing into the economy. This increased liquidity can find its way into various markets, including digital assets, as investors look for opportunities beyond traditional fixed-income securities. Anticipating Crypto Market Impact How might this crypto market impact play out? Historically, periods of lower interest rates and increased liquidity have sometimes coincided with greater investor appetite for riskier assets. Cryptocurrencies, known for their volatility and high growth potential, often fall into this category. Consider these potential scenarios: Increased Capital Flow: With lower returns on conventional savings, some investors might reallocate funds towards cryptocurrencies, seeking better growth prospects. Inflation Hedging: If the rate cut leads to concerns about inflation in the long run, some investors might view assets like Bitcoin as a potential hedge against currency devaluation, similar to gold. Risk-On Sentiment: A general loosening of monetary policy can foster a ‚Äòrisk-on‚Äô environment, where investors are more willing to take on speculative positions, benefiting crypto. However, it‚Äôs also important to remember that the crypto market reacts to a multitude of factors, not just central bank decisions. Global economic health, regulatory developments, and technological advancements within the crypto space all play a significant role. Navigating Central Bank Decisions and Your Portfolio This recent move by the Bank of England is part of a broader trend of central bank decisions globally, as economies navigate post-pandemic recovery and inflation challenges. Staying informed about these monetary policy shifts is vital for any investor, especially those in the dynamic crypto space. What actionable insights can you draw from this? Stay Informed: Keep an eye on announcements from other major central banks (e.g., the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank) as their actions can also influence global liquidity and investor sentiment. Diversify Wisely: While rate cuts might make crypto more appealing, maintaining a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance remains a sound strategy. Long-Term View: Short-term market reactions can be unpredictable. Focus on the long-term fundamentals of the crypto projects you invest in. The Bank of England‚Äôs rate cut is a significant economic event. While its direct impact on the crypto market can be complex and multi-faceted, it certainly adds another layer to the economic backdrop against which digital assets operate. Understanding these shifts helps you make more informed decisions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a basis point (bps)? A basis point (bps) is a common unit of measure in finance, equal to one-hundredth of a percentage point. So, 25 bps is 0.25%. Q2: Why did the Bank of England cut interest rates? The Bank of England likely cut rates to stimulate economic growth by making borrowing cheaper for businesses and consumers, encouraging investment and spending, and potentially easing inflationary pressures. Q3: How do interest rate cuts typically affect traditional financial markets? Rate cuts generally make borrowing cheaper, which can boost stock markets (as company profits may increase) and make bonds less attractive (as their yields decrease). They can also weaken the domestic currency. Q4: Is this rate cut definitively good or bad for cryptocurrency? There‚Äôs no definitive answer. Lower rates can make traditional investments less appealing, potentially driving capital into riskier assets like crypto. However, crypto markets are influenced by many factors, and a rate cut alone doesn‚Äôt guarantee a positive or negative outcome. Q5: What should crypto investors consider after this announcement?

Most of the top ten tokens on CoinMarketCap have posted solid daily gains , with $BTC pushing above $116K, $ETH climbing past $3.8K, and $SOL jumping over 5% in the past 24 hours. Even the Fear & Greed Index is creeping towards ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô territory, hinting at renewed confidence across the board. But while the majors are rebounding, one of the most talked-about projects right now isn‚Äôt even listed yet: Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) . The presale for this Bitcoin Layer 2 has now pulled in just under $7.5M, and the momentum isn‚Äôt slowing down. So what‚Äôs behind the broader recovery? And why is $HYPER turning heads in the middle of it? Green Charts Return ‚Äì But What‚Äôs Fueling the Recovery? The crypto market is enjoying a rare stretch of synchronized green, with weekly gains stacking up across the board. $BTC is up almost 2% over the past 24 hours, pushing it firmly above the $116K mark, while $ETH has tacked up 5.36% , trading around $3.8K $SOL is leading the majors with a 5.67% daily pump, continuing its role as a momentum magnet for top altcoin traders. Meanwhile, sentiment is catching up. The Fear & Greed Index has crept up to 54 after bottoming at 48 recently, inching closer to ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô territory and reflecting a slow but steady return of market confidence. This rebound isn‚Äôt just about Bitcoin strength; it‚Äôs about traders hunting for what‚Äôs next. And increasingly, the action is moving down the market cap ladder. L2s and Meme Coins Are Gaining Steam ‚Äì What Comes Next? When majors like $BTC and $ETH stabilize, liquidity tends to trickle down. And that‚Äôs exactly what‚Äôs happening now. Layer 2s and the best meme coins are gaining steam, especially projects that blend strong tech with meme-worthy community pull. Just look at $POL (Polygon), up over 8% today, and $MNT (Mantle), which added 4.91% today alongside its incredible 22.89% this week . Meme coin staples are getting fresh inflows ‚Äì $DOGE is up 5.7% , $PEPE climbed 5% , and $PENGU leads the pack with an 11.3% daily gain, hinting that risk appetite is returning to the market. Historically, meme coin cycles tend to kick off during recoveries (think early 2021 and mid-2023), when traders are hungry for high-volatility plays with viral upside. That sets the stage for hybrid projects like Bitcoin Hyper, which fuses the degen energy of meme coins with the actual utility of a Bitcoin Layer 2. The Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) has already proven it can handle speed and scale for memes. Now it‚Äôs Bitcoin‚Äôs shot. Why Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Is One of the Most Hyped Projects of the Cycle Bitcoin Hyper is building what Bitcoin‚Äôs never had: a high-speed, meme-ready execution layer backed by real, tested SVM architecture. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) has already pulled in $7.43M+, a clear signal that retail demand is heating up. With a presale price of $0.01255 and 145% staking rewards, early adopters are jumping in fast ‚Äì not just for the memes, but for the mechanics. Because here‚Äôs the thing: Bitcoin Hyper isn‚Äôt your average meme coin. It‚Äôs the first real Bitcoin Layer 2 powered by the SVM, built to deliver the speed, scalability, and low fees Bitcoin has always lacked. Imagine this: you deposit $BTC ‚Üí it gets verified trustlessly via smart contracts ‚Üí and is instantly minted on Bitcoin Hyper‚Äôs Layer 2. This gives you Solana‚Äôs sub-second transaction speeds and near-zero gas fees, while ZK-proofs maintain secure settlement on the Bitcoin Layer 1. And it‚Äôs cross-chain from day one: assets can flow freely between $BTC, $ETH, and $SOL ecosystems. $HYPER is the fuel behind it all. It powers staking, governance, airdrops, launch access, and dApps. And yes, it‚Äôs fully audited and built for degens who want more than just a chart to stare at. Meme-ready, tech-stacked, and culture-driven, Bitcoin Hyper is shaping up to be one of the most talked-about launches of the cycle. To learn more about the project, its tokenomics, community sentiment, and more, check out our What is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) guide . Final Thoughts: Why $HYPER Could Lead the Next Altcoin Wave The broader market rebound is a welcome signal, but the next leg up is likely to be shaped by alt narratives. Projects that combine strong fundamentals with degen appeal are gaining traction fast. And Bitcoin Hyper is one of them. With over $7.43M raised and staking rewards over 145%, it‚Äôs no surprise $HYPER is gaining steam in both trader circles and builder communities. But remember, meme coins, L2s, and the entire crypto industry carry inherent risks. This is not financial advice.

Ripple does not have ‚Äúsecret access‚Äù to the XRP Ledger (XRPL) network ‚Äî the blockchain is fully decentralized, Ripple‚Äôs CTO David Schwartz stated in an interview with Decrypt. ‚ÄùWe are a significant contributor to the ecosystem. It is certainly very important to us. But we have no interest or desire to control or manage the network,‚Äù Schwartz said. Critics have pointed to the relatively low number of validators on the XRPL‚Äî187 according to XRPScan‚Äîmuch fewer than Bitcoin‚Äôs roughly 23,000 nodes as reported by Bitnodes. However, Schwartz emphasized that the number alone is not the key metric; the distribution among independent operators matters most. According to Schwartz, Ripple operates only one of 35 validators‚Äîless than 1% of the total network. All major protocol changes require 80% agreement from network participants. ‚ÄúWe physically cannot block transactions or change the rules of the game unilaterally,‚Äù he added. The XRP Ledger uses Unique Node Lists (UNLs), which are trusted validator nodes independently selected by each participant. The official UNL maintained by the XRP Foundation used to include Ripple nodes but now operates independently. Some critics allege Ripple influences the market by periodically selling XRP tokens‚Äîit currently controls about 38 billion XRP. Schwartz denies any manipulation, stating that sales from escrow affect liquidity but do not impact blockchain operations.

This groundbreaking framework establishes the first federal regulations for ‚Äúpayment stablecoins,‚Äù mandating full 1:1 backing by cash or liquid U.S. Treasuries, while enforcing monthly reserve disclosures and auditing requirements. These developments have accelerated adoption within the stablecoin sector as builders, users, and stakeholders gain increased confidence in its utility and efficiency. For example, in July, the combined market capitalization of non-USD stablecoins, including euro and ruble-backed tokens, exceeded $1 billion for the first time.

He also said it could impede Hong Kong‚Äôs global digital finance market competitiveness. Hong Kong‚Äôs long-awaited Stablecoin Ordinance was established on August 1, making it the first market globally to regulate fiat-referenced stablecoin issuers. Tang said the bill‚Äôs know-your-customer (KYC) rules, which require issuers to verify the identity of every holder, oppose the basis of secrecy and privacy. HKMA claims stablecoin requirements mean to prevent illegal activities The Hong Kong Monetary Authority stated that such parameters are necessary to prevent terrorism financing and money laundering. The agency argued that it wants to take a more cautious approach in its first steps as it navigates through the industry. Tang said that such measures are a bit too strict and not good for acquiring users. He also argued that industry participants interested in cross-border payments using the country‚Äôs regulated stablecoins will require the receiver to open an account in Hong Kong just to pass KYC checks. Tang maintained that the KYC rules limit the advantages of stablecoins over traditional payments, such as efficiency and privacy. He also argued that HKMA‚Äôs strict rules might be a way to limit the frenzy in the country among investors looking into companies that want to invest in stablecoins and virtual currencies. The fiat-backed digital assets maintain a constant value, and their underlying blockchain technology enables instant, borderless transfer of funds at low cost. Hong Kong-based crypto trader, Ricky Xie, noted that the country‚Äôs KYC rules are tougher than those in the U.S. He believes that many foreign users may opt out of the country‚Äôs stablecoin market because KYC is affecting not only those with accounts with the issuer, but also every stablecoin holder. ‚ÄúThe Ordinance has established a risk-based, pragmatic, and flexible regulatory regime. We believe that a robust and fit-for-purpose regulatory environment would provide favorable conditions to support the healthy, responsible, and sustainable development of Hong Kong‚Äôs stablecoin and other broader digital asset ecosystem.‚Äù ‚Äì Eddie Yue , Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. PwC‚Äôs digital asset Asia lead, Peter Brewin, believes that the main HKMA-regulated stablecoin users are Chinese companies. He argued that those firms use digital currencies for cross-border money transfers, trade, payments, and remittances. The HKMA banned anonymous wallets to mitigate illegal transactions and improve transparency. Hong Kong‚Äôs Stablecoin Ordinance also comes with cross-border compliance obligations requiring firms to ensure their operations meet international standards. The regulation also prohibits any link between licensed stablecoin entities and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. The country‚Äôs financial regulator said the initiative aims to distance Hong Kong from the DeFi sector, raising concerns within the crypto community about the future of decentralized finance in the region. HKMA plans to begin issuing licenses early next year HKMA also requires stablecoin issuers to begin applying for licenses starting this month. The agency said it wants stablecoin issuers to comply with a flurry of requirements, such as proper management of asset reserves and segregation of client assets. The country‚Äôs financial regulator said parties interested in applying for a license should contact the agency by August 31 so that it may communicate regulatory expectations and provide feedback. Interested parties that believe they are sufficiently fit for licensing should contact the agency by September 30. The country‚Äôs financial regulator said it will issue its first license in 2026 at the earliest. HKMA‚Äôs deputy chief executive Darryl Chan also revealed that only a handful of entities will be granted licenses in the first batch of applications. Get seen where it counts.

Understanding which specific pairs are affected is paramount for all OKX users. The delisting schedule is precise, with different batches of pairs being removed on separate days in August. The first batch of delistings is scheduled for August 14th, between 06:00 and 10:00 UTC . The pairs to be removed on this date include: AAVE/USDC ADA/USDC ALGO/USDT APE/USDC APT/USDC ATOM/USDC AVAX/USDC BCH/USDC CHZ/USDC DOT/USDC LINK/USDC NEAR/USDC Following closely, the second wave of delistings will occur on August 15th, also between 06:00 and 10:00 UTC .

This gives you control over your exit price. Transfer Assets: If you hold any of the base or quote assets (e.g., AAVE, USDC, USDT) from the delisted pairs in your margin account, consider transferring them to your funding or trading accounts. This ensures accessibility and flexibility for future trades. Stay Informed: Regularly check OKX‚Äôs official announcements page for any further updates or clarifications regarding this or other changes. Understanding the Implications of Delisted Trading Pairs While the immediate impact is on margin trading, understanding why exchanges make such decisions provides broader insight. Typically, delistings occur due to factors like low liquidity, insufficient market demand for certain pairs, or a strategic decision to streamline offerings. This OKX exchange update aims to optimize their trading environment, ensuring focus on more liquid and actively traded assets. The OKX margin trading delisting serves as a vital reminder for all cryptocurrency traders to stay informed about exchange announcements and proactively manage their portfolios.

Martinez tells his 145,900 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin has previously corrected by 20% to 30% in two instances after the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the weekly chart fell below the 14-period smooth moving average (SMA) overlaid on it. The RSI is a momentum oscillator used to determine oversold or overbought conditions. The RSI crossing the moving average indicates a bearish signal, while the RSI crossing above a moving average is a bullish signal. ‚ÄúIf history repeats, we could see a move down to $95,000!‚Äù Source: Ali Martinez/X The widely followed analyst also says that based on Bitcoin‚Äôs Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Extreme Deviation Price Bands, the $111,000 price is a ‚Äúcritical support level‚Äù for the crypto king and could lead to a correction of around 20% from the current area if it breaks. The MVRV Extreme Deviation Pricing Bands are a tool used to determine potential support and resistance levels based on the standard deviation of Bitcoin‚Äôs MVRV ratio from its historical mean. The MVRV ratio, which is simply the ratio of Bitcoin‚Äôs market cap relative to the price when coins were last moved, indicates whether Bitcoin at current prices is above a fair value (overvalued) or not (undervalued).

Moca Network , a prominent player in the Web3 gaming and metaverse space, recently made a significant announcement that highlights its long-term vision: a strategic extension of its token cliff . This move directly impacts investors and sets the stage for the highly anticipated Moca Chain launch . What Does Moca Network‚Äôs Token Cliff Extension Mean for Investors? In a move signaling robust preparation, Moca Network announced on X a crucial update to its MOCA tokenomics . This update primarily involves extending the vesting cliff for a substantial 90% of investors. What exactly does this mean for those holding MOCA tokens or considering future involvement? Extended Waiting Period: The vesting cliff for the majority of investors now stretches to Q4 2025. This means a longer period before these tokens begin to unlock and become transferable. Strategic Partner Lock-up: Tokens held by strategic partners will remain locked until late 2025, with their full vesting schedule extending through January 2027. This demonstrates a shared commitment to the project‚Äôs long-term success. Foundation for Moca Chain: This extension is a direct precursor to the upcoming Moca Chain launch , aiming to ensure stability and alignment as the new blockchain goes live. This decision reflects a deliberate strategy to foster a healthy, sustainable ecosystem, preventing immediate sell-offs and promoting a more stable market environment for the MOCA token. Understanding MOCA Tokenomics: Allocations for a Sustainable Future A deeper dive into the updated MOCA tokenomics reveals a thoughtful distribution designed to support the network‚Äôs growth and longevity. Understanding these allocations helps us grasp the project‚Äôs priorities and how resources will be channeled. The core allocations are structured as follows: Network Incentives (31.5%): A significant portion is dedicated to incentivizing participation and activity within the Moca Network ecosystem. This could include rewards for validators, developers, and active users, crucial for driving adoption. Ecosystem and Treasury (20%): This allocation provides vital resources for ecosystem development, partnerships, grants, and general operational expenses. It acts as a flexible fund to adapt to market conditions and pursue strategic opportunities. Team (12%): The team‚Äôs allocation is essential for retaining talent and ensuring long-term commitment from those building the network. Vesting schedules for team tokens are typically long, aligning their interests with the project‚Äôs success. These allocations are standard practice in well-structured crypto projects, aiming to balance immediate needs with long-term sustainability and growth. Why is Token Vesting Crucial for Blockchain Stability? The concept of token vesting is a cornerstone of responsible tokenomics, particularly for new blockchain initiatives like the forthcoming Moca Chain launch . It plays a vital role in preventing market instability and fostering long-term commitment from all stakeholders. Prevents Price Volatility: By gradually releasing tokens, vesting prevents a sudden influx of supply that could depress prices, protecting early investors and the overall market. Aligns Incentives: It ensures that team members, strategic partners, and early investors are incentivized to work towards the project‚Äôs long-term success, as their rewards are tied to the network‚Äôs sustained value. Builds Trust: A transparent and extended vesting schedule signals maturity and commitment, building trust within the community and attracting serious participants. This extended crypto token cliff for Moca Network investors is a strategic maneuver, aiming to create a more stable and predictable environment as they prepare for a major transition to their own blockchain. The decision by Moca Network to extend its token cliff and update its MOCA tokenomics is a clear indicator of a methodical and long-term approach. By prioritizing stability and careful token distribution ahead of the anticipated Moca Chain launch , the network is laying a robust foundation for its future. This move, while requiring patience from investors, ultimately aims to cultivate a more resilient and sustainable ecosystem. It reinforces the idea that strategic delays can often lead to stronger, more enduring projects in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a token cliff in cryptocurrency? A token cliff is an initial period during which no vested tokens are released to investors or team members. After this period, tokens typically begin to unlock according to a predefined vesting schedule. 2. Why did Moca Network extend its token cliff? Moca Network extended its token cliff to ensure greater stability and alignment of interests among investors and strategic partners, especially in preparation for the upcoming Moca Chain launch. This helps prevent early token dumps and supports long-term ecosystem health. 3. How does the Moca Chain launch relate to these updates? The extension of the token cliff and the updated tokenomics are directly linked to the Moca Chain launch. These measures aim to create a stable economic environment for the new blockchain, ensuring a smoother transition and sustainable growth once it goes live. 4. What are the main allocations in MOCA tokenomics? Key allocations in MOCA tokenomics include 31.5% for network incentives, 20% for ecosystem and treasury development, and 12% for the team, among other categories not detailed in the announcement. 5. When will investor tokens begin to vest? For 90% of investors, the extended vesting cliff means their tokens will begin to vest from Q4 2025. Strategic partner tokens will remain locked until late 2025, with vesting extending through January 2027.

Swiss political leaders are taking an unconventional diplomatic route to ease the escalating trade tensions with the United States. This route includes enlisting FIFA‚Äôs President, Gianni Infantino. Infantino, a Swiss national and the president of football‚Äôs global governing body, has a long-standing personal rapport with the U.S. President Donald Trump. That relationship, lawmakers argue, could provide vital backchannel access to Trump amid the tariff crisis. Swiss lawmakers urge FIFA‚Äôs Infantino to intervene in trade tensions Switzerland, traditionally known for its neutrality and pragmatic diplomacy, was hit this month with the highest U.S. tariff rate in Europe, a 39% duty on key exports. Despite direct appeals from the Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter and the Economy Minister Guy Parmelin, the decision has not been reversed. Switzerland had believed it was close to a compromise with U.S. officials and hoped to bring the tariff rate closer to 10% after rounds of negotiations with Trump‚Äôs trade representative, Jamieson Greer and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. But last week, in a call with Keller-Sutter , Trump cited America‚Äôs $39B trade deficit with Switzerland as justification for the harsher penalty. Trump was dismissive of Keller-Sutter‚Äôs arguments, telling CNBC that ‚Äúthe woman was nice but [the Swiss president] didn‚Äôt want to listen‚Äù to his grievances over the trade imbalance. After meeting with the U.S. Foreign Minister Marco Rubio on Wednesday, the Swiss delegation left the U.S. empty-handed. ‚ÄúAt today‚Äôs meeting with Foreign Minister [Marco Rubio] we discussed bilateral co-operation between Switzerland and the US, the customs situation, and international issues.‚Äù Keller-Sutter wrote in a post on X. The Swiss press has been harsh in its criticism of the government‚Äôs diplomatic efforts, calling them disorganized and lacking urgency. The failure to reach an agreement has sparked further domestic criticism of the government‚Äôs negotiation strategy and triggered calls for creative alternatives ‚Äî Cue Infantino . Trump‚Äôs relationship with Infantino Infantino, who hails from Brig in southern Switzerland, has developed a close relationship with Trump over the past several years. He attended Trump‚Äôs inauguration in 2017 and has shared the stage with the former president on multiple occasions, most recently at the FIFA Club World Cup final in New Jersey. Just last month, Infantino visited the Trump Tower to inaugurate a new FIFA office. Trump has frequently spoken of Infantino in glowing terms, calling him a ‚Äúfriend of mine,‚Äù a ‚Äúwinner,‚Äù and an ‚Äúexcellent guy.‚Äù Swiss National Councillor Roland Rino B√ºchel, a member of the right-wing Swiss People‚Äôs Party (SVP), said it is time to make use of that connection. ‚ÄúIt is definitely time to bring in Gianni Infantino now without further delay to help open doors,‚Äù B√ºchel told the Financial Times. ‚ÄúIf Parmelin picked up the phone and asked Infantino for help, I would well imagine he would do it.‚Äù B√ºchel knows both Infantino and Parmelin personally and believes the football executive is uniquely placed to provide access to Trump. ‚ÄúThe situation is bad. We need better ideas for the good of the country and the thousands of jobs that will be affected if we do not get a better deal,‚Äù he added. B√ºchel also noted Parmelin‚Äôs long-standing relationship with Infantino, dating back to his time as Swiss minister of sport between 2016 and 2018. The two were recently seen seated together at a Switzerland vs. Serbia match, and in a 2021 Instagram post, Infantino praised Parmelin as ‚Äúa great supporter of our beautiful game.‚Äù Thomas Borer, a former Swiss ambassador to Germany and a high-profile foreign policy figure, backed up the idea, telling Swiss media this week that turning to Infantino was ‚Äúnot a bad idea.‚Äù So far, neither the Swiss economy ministry nor FIFA has commented on the proposal, and it‚Äôs unclear whether any formal outreach has been initiated.

With the Ethereum ecosystem set to be the biggest gainer in the coming months, the SHIB coin and Unilabs Finance (UNIL) are at the top of the ERC-20 tokens list. Their growth prospects and budget-friendliness are some of their biggest attractions, with UNIL‚Äôs blend of AI and DeFi making it more appealing. How Much Further Down Can the Cardano Price Go? The Cardano price stalled following a 10% decline in the weekly timeframe. As momentum drops, the Layer-1 altcoin hovers around $0.71, with investors fearing further decline toward lower price levels. Meanwhile, technical indicators suggest now might be a great time to sell, highlighted by the bearish MACD level and 9-HMA. TradingPuzzles‚Äô price prediction further adds to the token‚Äôs bleak outlook. According to their forecasts, as long as the Cardano price remains below $0.7, there is a high chance of a potential decline toward $0.64 and $0.55 . On the other hand, according to Messari , mindshare is high, giving an optimistic outlook. A breakout above $0.8 could ignite a run toward its 30-day high of $0.92 and potentially spark a significant rebound in the Cardano price. The SHIB Coin Could Be The Next Big Runner While memecoins have been largely underwhelming this quarter, things are about to change. The SHIB coin, leading the meme narrative on the Ethereum blockchain, is a promising play on the experts‚Äô ERC-20 tokens list. Down 85% from its 2021 ATH of $0.000088, the dog-themed cryptocurrency has plenty of room to run. That isn‚Äôt all. It is budget-friendly, with a SHIB coin going for just $0.000012 following an 8% dip in the weekly timeframe. Bulls pushing the SHIB coin toward its 30-day peak of $0.000015 is expected to spark FOMO. Moreover, daily trading volume is increasing, up 30% and exceeding $200 million, which could ignite a big leap in price in the coming days. Unilabs Finance (UNIL) ‚Äî Significantly Underpriced and Undervalued At $0.0097, experts consider the Unilabs Finance (UNIL) token a steal. Since debuting in presale at $0.004, the price has increased by 142%, although new investors still stand to gain a 415% return at the listing price of $0.05. With more gains anticipated this year after its listing, it has staggering potential on the experts‚Äô top ERC-20 tokens list. Meanwhile, as the first AI-backed asset management platform for digital assets, analysts have drawn a parallel with DeFAI protocols like Derive (DRV) and Supra (SUPRA). While these protocols are valued around $50 million, Unilabs Finance‚Äôs competitive edge is its redistribution of 30% of the total platform-generated fees to users. Other incentives to holding include staking rewards, periodic airdrops and governance rights, driving more demand. Underpriced and undervalued, a token costs only $0.0097 in the sixth ICO stage, with a staggering $11.4 million raised in early funding. Closing Thoughts As the Cardano price stalls, experts have drawn up an ERC-20 tokens list of high-potential altcoins. On this list are the SHIB coin and the UNIL token, significantly undervalued and underpriced. By combining AI, DeFi and TradFi, Unilabs Finance (UNIL), the world‚Äôs first decentralized asset manager, is both fundamentally solid and promising.

The bank‚Äôs CFO, Kwon Tae-hoon, announced the development during its first-half 2025 earnings call, stating that the firm is ‚Äúreviewing various methods such as issuance and custody‚Äù and intends to ‚Äúactively participate‚Äù in the emerging digital asset ecosystem. This initiative is being spearheaded by Kakao‚Äôs dedicated Stablecoin Task Force, which includes leadership from Kakao‚Äôs core affiliates such as KakaoPay. The move is seen as a direct response to President Lee‚Äôs administration, which has been pushing forward legislation to legalize stablecoins and strengthen South Korea‚Äôs position in the digital asset market. KakaoBank Prepares Infrastructure, Competes with Peers On June 23, KakaoBank filed for multiple trademarks related to stablecoin services‚Äîcoinciding with filings from Kookmin Bank, a key rival under KB Financial Group. In total, eight major South Korean banks are aiming to launch Korean won-pegged stablecoins by 2026, signaling an industry-wide shift toward blockchain-based financial products. Kwon noted KakaoBank‚Äôs past involvement with digital asset infrastructure , including the issuance of real-name verified accounts for crypto exchanges and participation in the Bank of Korea‚Äôs CBDC pilot. The company already manages $46.47 billion in assets and has 25.86 million users‚Äîroughly half of South Korea‚Äôs population‚Äîmaking it one of the most influential players in the national banking sector. The momentum behind crypto adoption in South Korea has also been amplified by global political developments. Following the U.S. election win of Donald Trump in November 2024, the number of crypto exchange users in South Korea surged past 16 million, now representing over 30% of the country‚Äôs population. Global Institutions Also Join Stablecoin Race The push from KakaoBank aligns with a broader international trend toward stablecoin adoption. A May 2025 report by digital asset infrastructure firm Fireblocks found that 90% of surveyed institutional entities were exploring stablecoin use. Governments and financial institutions around the world are increasingly viewing stablecoins as a viable tool for payments, remittances, and settlement. In April, Russia‚Äôs finance ministry discussed launching a national stablecoin, while three major Abu Dhabi institutions began developing a dirham-pegged digital currency .

The move would benefit alternative asset firms the most, giving them access to a new $12 trillion retirement market and helping their investment products reach the mainstream. Of course, the crypto market as a whole is expected to feel the effects of the new order. Bitcoin ( BTC ), for instance, rose from $114,900 to $115,670 within an hour of the announcement. While the cryptocurrency is still way below the psychological threshold of $120,000, the rally has generated a lot of speculation, leading to a jump in futures open interest (+1.25% in the past hour as of the time of writing based on CoinGlass data). However, it is not clear whether the executive order will result in immediate shifts, as government agencies will still need to develop new regulations, which could take until 2026, according to Jaret Seiberg, a financial services policy analyst at TD Cowen Washington Research Group. Likewise, once the regulations have been outlined, workplace retirement plan sponsors will have to do extensive research and restructuring before offering new investment options .

The Ethereum blockchain is accessible to everyone and built to support scalability, programmability, security, and decentralization, allowing for the creation of secure digital technology. Its native digital currency, ether (ETH), and smart contracts have attracted investors‚Äô recognition and interest, while developers appreciate its utility in developing blockchain and decentralized finance applications.

What will ETH be worth in 5 years?‚Äù Let‚Äôs get into the details by exploring Ethereum‚Äôs price predictions from 2025 through 2031.

The price is holding above the middle Bollinger Band, indicating bullish momentum may persist. ETHUSD chart by TradingView The RSI has rebounded to 60.21, suggesting room for further upside before hitting overbought conditions. ETH is trading at $3,715, with upper resistance near $3,922 and support around $3,452. If momentum continues, the price could retest the $3,800‚Äì$3,900 range. However, if bears regain control, ETH may pull back toward the $3,600 level. Overall, the chart leans bullish but still requires strong volume to break above key resistance. ETH price analysis on the 4-hour chart: Ethereum Eyes Resistance at $3,743 as Bulls Regain Control in Short-Term Momentum Based on the 4-hour chart for Ethereum (ETH) on Aug 7, the price is consolidating near $3,720 with upward momentum after rebounding from the $3,536 support level.

ETHUSD chart by TradingView The MACD line is above the signal line, showing bullish momentum. Additionally, the Balance of Power indicator reads 0.67, indicating buyers are gaining strength. If ETH holds above the middle Bollinger Band (~$3,640), it could attempt another rally. However, failure to break $3,743 convincingly may lead to a brief consolidation or retracement.

Ethereum is the largest DeFi hub with a vibrant layer-two ecosystem in the crypto market. The blockchain constantly develops, making it a go-to choice for many Web3 developers. ETH, its native token, shows promise, and the possibility of an Ethereum ETF approval makes it favorable for day traders. Over the long term, explore our price predictions. However, the opinions expressed are not investment advice; traders should consider researching before investing. What is a realistic price for Ethereum in 2025? The realistic price for Ethereum in 2025 is around $5,019 at the maximum. What will 1 Ethereum be worth in 2030? One Ethereum is expected to be worth $36,694 maximum in 2030. How high can ETH realistically go? Ethereum‚Äôs price potential depends on multiple factors, including market trends, institutional adoption, network upgrades, and macroeconomic conditions. Realistically, ETH could reach $5,000 to $7,000 in the next bullish cycle if demand increases and Ethereum‚Äôs Layer 2 solutions and scalability improvements boost adoption. If institutional interest strengthens, ETH may push past $10,000 over the long term, especially if Ethereum remains the dominant smart contract platform. However, volatility remains a key risk, with price corrections likely along the way. Regulatory clarity and Ethereum‚Äôs shift to proof-of-stake (PoS) efficiency could also positively influence its long-term valuation. Will ETH reach $10,000? Ethereum is projected to exceed $10,000 as early as 2027, with its potential low starting at $10,133 and a high of $11,875. Will ETH reach $25,000? Ethereum is predicted to surpass the $25,000 level by 2029 and reach a potential high of $25,866. This optimistic outlook is based on Ethereum‚Äôs ongoing development, network security, and increasing adoption. However, cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, so long-term projections should be cautiously approached. Will ETH reach $40,000? Based on our analysis, Ethereum will likely reach the $40,000 mark. The highest expected price is around $51,567 in 2031. Does Ethereum have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but ETH is trading above its average price of the last two years. However, a positive outbreak can be expected. The ETH/USD pair is expected to reach the $56,126 mark by 2031, so holding it longer can be beneficial. Recent news/ opinion on Ethereum Ethereum Celebrates 10 Years as DeFi‚Äôs Foundation Ethereum marks its 10th anniversary, transforming from a visionary whitepaper into the backbone of decentralized finance. Since its launch, Ethereum has enabled billions in value to move seamlessly across a vibrant DeFi ecosystem. The transition to proof-of-stake following The Merge has established staking as a core network feature, attracting over one million validators who now secure the network. Institutions increasingly choose platforms like Figment to stake, citing non-custodial options, SOC 2 Type II compliance, robust MEV policies, and audit-ready reporting. As Ethereum enters its second decade, it continues to shape an open, secure financial future. üéâ @ethereum turns 10!

He pointed to the company‚Äôs massive crypto holdings as the key driver of its value. Lee noted that, like oil companies of old, Strategy‚Äôs market value comes more from what‚Äôs in its vault than from its quarterly profits. Bold Claims On Market Value Based on Lee‚Äôs comments , Strategy could surpass giants such as NVIDIA and Microsoft‚Äîif Bitcoin ever reaches $1 million. ExxonMobil once held a spot in the top five of the S&P 500 for an entire generation thanks to its oil reserves. Now Lee sees Strategy in that same role, only trading oil for Bitcoin. He argues that the company‚Äôs balance sheet, loaded with digital coins, is changing how we measure corporate size. Strategy‚Äôs shares trade at about $380. That puts its market cap near $2.50 billion. By contrast, NVIDIA sits at roughly $4.3 trillion and Microsoft at $3.9 trillion. To overtake NVIDIA based on its current 628,791 BTC stash, Bitcoin would need to hit more than $6 million per coin. Even at $1 million, those coins would total about $620 billion‚Äîbig, but still below today‚Äôs leaders. Bitcoin Holdings At Scale Reports have disclosed that Strategy paid $46 billion to build its Bitcoin hoard. Today that stash is worth about $70 billion. The company holds only $50 million in fiat cash. Lee pointed out that this makes Strategy‚Äôs treasury one of the top 10 among all US companies. It ranks ahead of names like PayPal and ExxonMobil simply because it owns volatile, appreciating crypto instead of static cash. In its latest move, Strategy filed for a $4.2 billion STRC offering. The plan is to convert those proceeds directly into Bitcoin. That will boost its coin count and further cement its identity as a Bitcoin-first treasury. Lee sees this as proof that more companies might shift from cash and bonds into digital assets if they want to chase big gains. Competition Among Treasuries Meanwhile, BitMine itself is taking cues from Strategy. It has gone all-in on Ethereum and now holds over 833,000 ETH, making it the largest public holder of that token. Lee believes that other firms will follow suit‚Äîsome choosing Bitcoin, others picking Ethereum or other blockchains. That could redraw the map of corporate finances, with digital coins sitting at the heart of many balance sheets.

49690325,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=800586,1754568045,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/49690325.jpeg,"Man Who Threw Away $1 Billion In Bitcoin Debunks Rumors, Here‚Äôs The Progress",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/man-1-billion-in-bitcoin/,"James Howells, the British man who famously lost access to 8,000 Bitcoin in a 2013 landfill accident, is setting the record straight. Taking to X (formerly Twitter), Howells pushed back against recent social media claims that he has abandoned his search. He firmly denied the rumors and revealed a new strategy to reclaim his lost fortune, now worth roughly $923 million. Although he‚Äôs no longer seeking permission from his local council to search the landfill, he‚Äôs far from done. Howells Debunks Rumors, Plans To Turn His Lost $1 Billion In Bitcoin Into Ceiniog Coin In the post shared on X, Howells confirmed he has not given up and slammed years of rejection from Newport City Council. For over a decade, he says he tried public proposals, legal talks, mediation, and even offered over $30 million to recover the drive buried in the landfill. ‚Äú$1 billion and they ignored it all,‚Äù he wrote. With no response from the council, he has decided to stop waiting. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Team Member Reveals ‚ÄòPrimary Challenge‚Äô And ‚ÄòTop Priority‚Äô Amid Market Uncertainty Instead of continuing legal fights or making more offers, Howells announced a new plan: to tokenize the entire wallet of 8,000 BTC into a new cryptocurrency called Ceiniog Coin (INI). Named after an ancient Welsh coin, Ceiniog will act as a Layer 2 token built on Bitcoin, matching 1:1 with satoshis, the smallest unit of Bitcoin. He plans to create 800 billion INI tokens, each directly linked to the 8,000 BTC sitting on the lost drive. According to Howells, Ceiniog will launch in late 2025, powered by Bitcoin‚Äôs OP_RETURN functionality. It will integrate with Web3 projects like Stacks, Runes, and Ordinals. With the ICO planned later this year, Howells hopes the coin‚Äôs market value will eventually match that of the lost BTC, making him a theoretical billionaire, just 8.34% away from that goal based on current prices. How He Lost The Bitcoin And What He‚Äôs Done To Get It Back The saga began in 2013, when James Howells, a British IT professional, accidentally threw out a hard drive that contained the keys to 8,000 BTC, now worth nearly a billion dollars. Realizing the mistake too late, Howells spent the next 12 years trying to recover it. Related Reading: Spot Ethereum ETFs Set A New Record In July With $5.4 Billion Monthly Inflow He submitted detailed recovery proposals, including environmental clean-up plans and AI-powered landfill scans. He even offered to raise $75 million by selling 21% of the Bitcoin‚Äôs value to fund the excavation. His most recent formal offer in July 2025, worth between $33 million and $40 million, included a full purchase of the landfill and a cleanup strategy. Citing environmental risks and lack of confidence in the outcome, the Newport City Council rejected the plan. Now, instead of digging through landfill waste, Howells is building Ceiniog Coin as his way of reclaiming what he believes is rightfully his. He plans to debut the coin at a discount, letting early supporters buy in before the coin reaches its full value. Over time, he hopes the token‚Äôs value will naturally rise to reflect the worth of 8,000 Bitcoin.

Analysts See 3,000% Upside Potential",https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/could-xyzhit-1-before-xrp-and-ada-analysts-see-3000-upside-potential/,"Speculation is growing about the potential of XYZ reaching $1 ahead of well-known coins like XRP and ADA. Experts point to a possible surge of 3,000%, making XYZ one of the most watched digital tokens right now. Market observers are eager to see which coin will break key price levels first and why XYZ stands out. Undervalued $XYZ Meme Coin Gears Up for Listing on a Major CEX XYZVerse ($XYZ) is the meme coin that has grabbed headlines with its ambitious claim of rising from $0.0001 to $0.1 during a presale phase. So far, it has gone halfway, raising over $15 million, and the price of the $XYZ token currently stands at $0.005 . At the next 14th stage of the presale, the $XYZ token value will further rise to $0.01 , meaning that early investors have the chance to secure a bigger discount. Following the presale, $XYZ will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The team has not disclosed the details yet, but they have put a teaser for a big launch. Born for Fighters, Built for Champions XYZVerse is building a community for those hungry for big profits in crypto ‚Äî the relentless, the ambitious, the ones aiming for dominance. This is a coin for true fighters ‚Äî a mindset that resonates with athletes and sports fans alike. $XYZ is the token for thrill-seekers chasing the next big meme coin. Central to the XYZVerse story is XYZepe ‚Äî a fighter in the meme coin arena, battling to climb the charts and make it to the top on CoinMarketCap. Will it become the next DOGE or SHIB? Time will tell. Community-First Vibes In XYZVerse, the community runs the show. Active participants earn hefty rewards, and the team has allocated a massive 10% of the total token supply ‚Äî around 10 billion $XYZ ‚Äî for airdrops, making it one of the largest airdrops on record. Backed by solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and regular token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every move is designed to boost momentum, drive price growth, and rally a loyal community that knows this could be the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More ‚Äî Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Ripple (XRP) Source: TradingView Last week XRP slipped 5.5%, trading now between 2.68 and 3.28. Even with the dip, the coin still shows a strong 30.1% jump for the month and a 27.06% gain over six months. The 10-day and 100-day moving lines sit at almost the same spot, near 2.95, hinting at a market that is pausing after its recent run. Buyers eye the next ceiling at 3.60, about 18% above today‚Äôs mid-range. A push past that could open a straight path to 4.20, another 27% higher. The relative strength meter stands at 46.65, right in the middle, while the MACD is slightly red at ‚Äë0.0180. Momentum is mixed, yet the stochastic reading of 59.94 tilts a bit toward the bulls. If sellers take charge, the first floor sits at 2.40, roughly 15% below. A break there could drag the price to 1.80, a total slide of about 34% from here. Until a clear move, expect swings inside the current band. A clean close above 3.60 would flip the tone to bullish, while a drop under 2.40 would mark the start of a deeper pullback. Cardano (ADA) Source: TradingView Cardano is trading between $0.66 and $0.83 after a choppy week. The coin lost 7% in 7 days, erasing part of the solid 24% jump logged over the past month. Zoom out 6 months and ADA is barely 3% higher, showing how hard it has been to break the broader range. The 10 day and 100 day price averages hug each other at $0.72 and $0.73. That flat picture means traders are waiting for a spark. The momentum score sits at 48, so neither side is in charge. A high swing reading near 81 hints at steady bids, yet the trend bar is faintly negative, so moves may stay slow. If bulls clear the nearest ceiling at $0.93, the token could sprint 12%-15% toward the second barrier near $1.10, a level that would mark a 30% lift from today‚Äôs mid range. Failure to punch higher leaves the door open for a slide to $0.59, about 12% lower, or even $0.41, a 30% tumble. Momentum favors a slow grind upward, but the chart says traders must earn every cent. Conclusion XRP, ADA, PEPE, and MOG remain strong coins, but XYZVerse stands out with its sports-driven community and bold targets. As the bull run drives growth, XYZ leads in momentum and innovation.

However, the plot thickens with news that interviews for the next Fed chair are already underway, as reported by Walter Bloomberg. This development offers crucial insights into Trump Fed policy and the future of central bank leadership , impacting the broader US economic outlook . What‚Äôs the Latest Buzz Around the Federal Reserve Chair? The role of the Federal Reserve Chair is pivotal for the U.S. economy. This individual guides monetary policy, influencing everything from interest rates to inflation. Scott Bessent‚Äôs recent comments clarify a long-standing question about President Trump‚Äôs intentions regarding Jerome Powell. It appears that while a direct firing is off the table, a transition is certainly on the horizon. For years, there has been speculation about President Trump‚Äôs relationship with current Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Their past interactions have sometimes been tense, particularly concerning interest rate decisions. Bessent‚Äôs statement brings a measure of stability to this dynamic, assuring markets that no abrupt dismissal is planned. However, the simultaneous announcement of interviews for the next Fed chair signals a clear intent. This isn‚Äôt about immediate change but rather about shaping the future direction of the nation‚Äôs monetary policy. It sets the stage for a thoughtful, albeit significant, transition. Decoding Trump‚Äôs Strategic Approach to Jerome Powell‚Äôs Future President Trump‚Äôs past criticisms of Jerome Powell often focused on the Fed‚Äôs interest rate hikes. These actions, in Trump‚Äôs view, sometimes hindered economic growth. The current update from Scott Bessent paints a nuanced picture of Trump Fed policy . It suggests a strategic rather than confrontational approach. Instead of an immediate dismissal, which could create market volatility, the administration is reportedly preparing for a natural succession. This allows for a smoother handover, prioritizing stability. The interview process for the next Fed chair indicates a proactive stance. It means the administration is evaluating candidates who align with its long-term economic vision. This careful consideration is vital for the continued strength of the US economic outlook . What Does New Central Bank Leadership Mean for the Economy? The search for new central bank leadership is a critical process. The Federal Reserve‚Äôs decisions directly affect everyday Americans, from borrowing costs for homes and cars to job market stability. Therefore, the choice of the next Fed chair is paramount. The interview process likely involves assessing candidates on their views concerning: Inflation control: How will they manage rising prices? Employment goals: What strategies will they pursue to foster job growth? Financial stability: How will they safeguard the banking system? A new Federal Reserve Chair could bring fresh perspectives to these challenges. While the Fed operates independently, its leadership is appointed by the President. This intertwining of roles makes the selection process intensely watched by investors and analysts alike, influencing the broader US economic outlook . Navigating the Potential Impact on the US Economic Outlook Any shift in central bank leadership naturally raises questions about the future trajectory of the US economic outlook . Markets often react to perceived changes in policy direction. The current news, however, suggests a managed transition rather than a disruptive one. The continuity provided by Jerome Powell remaining in his role for now, coupled with the foresight of interviewing successors, aims to mitigate uncertainty. This measured approach can help maintain market confidence. Key areas to watch as this transition unfolds include: Interest rate policy: Will the new chair continue current trends or pivot? Quantitative easing/tightening: How will they manage the Fed‚Äôs balance sheet? Regulatory stance: Will there be changes in banking supervision? Understanding these potential shifts is crucial for businesses and investors. The selection of the next Fed chair will undoubtedly shape economic conditions for years to come. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent‚Äôs clarification provides important insights into President Trump‚Äôs plans for the Federal Reserve Chair . While Jerome Powell is not facing an immediate ouster, the active search for the next Fed chair underscores a strategic and forward-looking approach to central bank leadership . This measured transition aims to ensure stability while aligning future monetary policy with the administration‚Äôs vision for the US economic outlook . The coming months will reveal more about who will guide the nation‚Äôs financial future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. Who is the current Federal Reserve Chair?

Daily Transaction Count Surpasses 2021 Peak! Here's All the Data,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/ethereum-transaction-volume-hits-new-record-daily-transaction-count-surpasses-2021-peak-heres-all-the-data/,"The Ethereum network reached an all-time high in average daily transactions as of August 5th. The number of transactions, measured by the 7-day moving average, rose to 1.74 million. This surpassed the previous record of 1.65 million set on May 12, 2021. Ethereum Breaks Record Transaction Volume: Daily Transaction Count Surpasses 2021 Peak July was also the busiest month in Ethereum's history, with a total of 46.67 million transactions occurring across the network. The number of active addresses also increased significantly. The network reached 683,520 active addresses on August 5th, and is now close to retesting the record of 743,730 set on May 12, 2021. Presto Research analyst Min Jung commented on the reasons for this rise: The record-breaking trading volume on Ethereum reflects the surge in DeFi activity. Stablecoins are at the center of this activity. Interest in yield-generating strategies has increased, particularly in anticipation of interest rate cuts. This has led to increased on-chain transactions: point farming, treasury usage, and more. Jung also highlighted the impact of Ethena's USDe stablecoin, which recently partnered with Aave and reached a market capitalization of $9 billion in a matter of weeks. Kronos Research CIO Vincent Liu stated that regulatory clarity efforts in the US and institutional investors' ETH accumulations played an important role in the increase in interest in Ethereum. Liu also said: ‚ÄúThe ETH price is still moving cautiously. Confidence is rising behind the scenes, but the market is still searching for balance. This increase in on-chain activity has not yet been fully reflected in the price.‚Äù Meanwhile, dozens of companies have recently adopted Ethereum-based treasury strategies to diversify their balance sheets with digital assets. The total value of ETH holdings among publicly traded companies has surpassed $7.5 billion. According to Liu, approval of Ethereum staking ETFs could trigger a new surge in both price and on-chain activity. This approval could pave the way for ETH to become a yield-generating asset for institutional investors. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Ethereum Transaction Volume Hits New Record!

The scammers reportedly use old YouTube accounts and strategically placed comments to create a false perception of legitimacy to target crypto traders through social media and video content distribution. The threat actors advertise fake crypto trading bots through YouTube videos targeting users. The videos explain how to deploy smart contracts on Remix Solidity Compiler, with the scammers presenting these tools as legitimate arbitrage or MEV bots for profit. Scammers use YouTube videos to distribute fake MEV trading bots The videos show a deliberate effort to use older YouTube accounts to appear credible. First, the scammers post cryptocurrency news playlists and off-topic content to boost account rankings to make accounts seem like trusted, legitimate crypto sources. Many videos appear AI-generated based on audio and visual characteristics. Narrators also have unnatural voice tones and only look directly at the camera. No side profile angles consistently appear in these fake presentations. Typically, AI-generated content saves costs compared to hiring human actors for videos. The most successful scam video did not use AI generation. This particular video generated over $900,000 in stolen funds from victims. One YouTube channel @todd_tutorials posted step-by-step deployment instructions for malicious contracts. The video became private after research began, but displayed AI characteristics. Another channel @SolidityTutorials featured similar content in April 2024 presentations. Screenshot of one of the crypto-draining trading bot channels. Source Sentinelone @Jazz_Braze created the most successful scam video titled MEV Bot tutorial. The video gained 387,000+ views and appeared more legitimate than others. The account uploaded nearly 100 pop culture videos between 2022-2024. The account operator likely built credibility over time through consistent uploads. Old YouTube accounts sell for $6 to thousands on Telegram channels. Comment sections remain overwhelmingly positive through moderation, filtering negative feedback automatically. Malicious smart contracts hide attacker addresses The fake trading bots contain malicious smart contracts written in Solidity programming language. These contracts target Ethereum and other blockchain networks for fund theft. Attackers use different obfuscation techniques to hide their wallet addresses from victims. The attacker-controlled wallet address stays hidden within smart contract code making detection difficult. SentinelLABS found multiple obfuscation methods across different contracts including XOR operations. String concatenation and large decimal conversions also conceal attacker wallets effectively. The contracts appear as legitimate MEV bots monitoring price differences across exchanges. Victims believe they‚Äôre deploying profitable arbitrage tools for automated trading. Multiple unique attacker addresses exist making it unclear how many actors operate. The same wallet appeared across several weaponized smart contracts consistently. Campaign generates over $900,000 in stolen Ethereum The scam campaigns achieved varying degrees of financial success across different operations. A recent April 2025 scam received 7.59 Ethereum worth approximately $28,000 from victims. SolidityTutorials video scam netted 4.19 ETH, valued at around $15,000 total. Jazz_Braze‚Äôs video campaign stands out as the most profitable, generating massive returns. The attacker‚Äôs wallet collected 244.9 ETH, worth approximately $902,000 from contract deposits. These funds were later withdrawn to other addresses in bulk transfers. The stolen funds moved to 24 different Ethereum addresses after collection. Attackers distributed money across multiple wallets to avoid detection and tracking. This distribution pattern suggests sophisticated money laundering operations behind the scams. Various campaigns have operated since early 2024 with different success rates. The scams continue targeting new victims through social media platforms. Attackers manage comment sections by deleting negative feedback to maintain false legitimacy. Users often go to platforms like Reddit when YouTube comments get censored.

But that conversation is shifting fast. In the last few sessions, XRP has slipped after three straight days of decline, and indicators aren‚Äôt offering much comfort. From dwindling user engagement on the XRP Ledger to falling open interest in the derivatives market, the short-term outlook appears shaky. Active addresses are down by 44% since July 18, reflecting a lack of conviction among traders. At the same time, capital seems to be moving elsewhere. One new viral altcoin , in particular, hasgained traction with investors who feel Ripple may have hit a local top. With speculation mounting that XRP could dip below $3, attention is turning to platforms offering more than just price action. XRP Price Prediction: Market Sentiment Sours Funding rates, Open Interest, and user activity are telling a familiar story when these metrics start weakening, confidence usually follows. XRP‚Äôs futures market has seen Open Interest drop from nearly $11 billion to $9 billion in just a few days. It‚Äôs a notable decline, especially after hitting that record high. The drop in user activity on XRPL is also striking, with the number of active addresses falling by nearly half . These are not isolated metrics. They paint a broader picture of reduced enthusiasm in the market. The XRP price prediction among analysts has shifted accordingly. Some now believe that unless sentiment shifts soon, Ripple could slide below the $3 mark. This possibility is accelerating the exit of retail investors looking for better opportunities. And that‚Äôs where DeSoc steps in. The Rise of a New Viral Altcoin: Why DeSoc Is Standing Out DeSoc isn‚Äôt just trending‚Äîit‚Äôs turning heads for all the right reasons. This new viral altcoin is building a decentralized social media platform where users can syndicate content across Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, and X, all while retaining control of their data. Unlike traditional platforms that keep engagement and revenue in-house, DeSoc flips the script. Content posted through DeSoc is recorded immutably on the blockchain. Every interaction is transparent, verifiable, and owned by the user. With built-in smart contracts, creators can monetize posts, offer exclusive content and even set up subscriptions using $SOCS tokens . Users who engage meaningfully by liking, commenting or sharing can earn too. This model creates a shared economy of value where everyone has a stake. DeSoc‚Äôs Presale Is Attracting Ripple Holders With XRP‚Äôs market signals flashing caution, many investors are reallocating to DeSoc‚Äôs presale , which is still in its early stages. Each $SOCS token is priced at $0.01, and the team has set clear boundaries for growth. The presale accounts for nearly half of the total token supply, with the remainder set aside for development, community rewards, marketing and liquidity. Unlike many new projects, DeSoc has implemented a 30-year liquidity lock and a two-year team token lock choices that prioritize long-term trust. This kind of structure is gaining attention from those previously committed to Ripple. The contrast between the declining speculative demand for XRP and the rising organic interest in a project with utility is hard to ignore. The current XRP price prediction is guiding some holders toward alternatives that feel more grounded. Real-World Function Meets Crypto Innovation Beyond just tokenomics, DeSoc is building a platform with real utility. Through a versatile API, the platform will integrate with existing social media networks, allowing users to post once and reach multiple audiences. All this happens while interactions are logged transparently on-chain. It‚Äôs a far cry from the closed, ad-driven models of Web2 platforms. Micropayments, tipping, gated content, and community rewards are all part of the experience. $SOCS tokens can be used to promote posts, buy ad space or unlock premium features. And with governance tools embedded into the protocol, token holders will have a say in future updates. Everything is designed with long-term sustainability in mind. Final Thoughts: As Ripple Slips, DeSoc Gains Ground As the momentum behind Ripple slows and the latest XRP price prediction points toward a possible dip below $3, investors are clearly looking for more stable and rewarding opportunities. DeSoc , by contrast, offers a working vision for blockchain's next chapter, one rooted in usability, transparency and participation. This new viral altcoin is still early, but the presale is moving quickly. It‚Äôs not just another bet on hype. DeSoc is solving real problems in how we share, earn and connect online.

Recent metrics such as falling open interest in the derivatives market and a significant drop in active addresses on the XRP Ledger suggest a waning enthusiasm among its traders. According to market observers, these signs could potentially lead XRP to dip below $3 soon. Shift in Investor Focus Amidst these uncertain times for XRP, capital is starting to flow towards newer and potentially more lucrative ventures. One such venture that's capturing the interest of the market is DeSoc , a burgeoning altcoin that promises to revolutionize how content is created, shared, and monetized on the internet. DeSoc: A New Contender in the Crypto Space The rise of DeSoc comes at a pivotal time when users are looking for more control over their digital content. This platform enables users to manage their digital presence across multiple social networks like Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, and X, while ensuring that they retain ownership of their data and earnings. By leveraging blockchain technology, DeSoc ensures that every user interaction is transparent and secure. The platform also empowers its users with smart contracts, allowing them to monetize their posts, create exclusive content, and build a subscriber base using DeSoc's $SOCS tokens . Strategic Investment Opportunities As XRP‚Äôs prospects dim, the DeSoc presale is drawing attention from former Ripple enthusiasts. It's a strategic shift from a weakening speculative market to a more stable investment in a platform that not only has utility but also a robust plan for future expansion and community engagement. DeSoc‚Äôs approach to locking in liquidity for 30 years and restricting team tokens for two years post-launch exemplifies its commitment to long-term success and trust-building within the crypto community. Conclusion: The Rise of Utility in Cryptocurrencies As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, the focus is shifting from speculative trading to sustainable platforms with real-world applications. DeSoc represents a move toward this trend, offering a viable alternative for those disillusioned with the current market dynamics of more established coins like Ripple. For investors and users eager to be at the forefront of the decentralized internet, DeSoc's innovative platform presents a compelling opportunity.

DeSoc , a blockchain-based social media platform still in presale, has raised over $10 million in less than two weeks. It‚Äôs not meme-fueled hype or whale games this time. The money is flowing in from real holders. Among them are Solana holders and Cardano investors looking for more than just the next 2x. Solana and Cardano continue making headlines with technical milestones and ETF buzz. Still, a growing number of holders from both camps are buying into DeSoc‚Äôs long-term vision. It envisions a decentralized social media protocol with actual use cases and clear token utility. Why are Cardano Investors Watching More Than Just Charts? Cardano recently broke out of its long-standing downtrend, retesting the $0.78 level with bullish momentum. ADA‚Äôs price sits just under $0.9 now, with resistance near $0.94 and targets as high as $1.20. Many Cardano investors see this as a healthy technical recovery. Yet, some are recognizing that Cardano‚Äôs slow rollout and academic approach may not bring fast real-world adoption. That‚Äôs why a portion of ADA profits are being rotated into projects like DeSoc platforms. These platforms are already solving problems and building real tools for everyday use. The promise of immutable content records, monetization through smart contracts, and decentralized governance has caught the eye of Cardano investors. They seem eager to support systems that move faster and have a more tangible connection to real-life online activity. Solana Holders Start Diversifying, and DeSoc Tops the List There‚Äôs no denying that Solana holders have had a strong run lately. The token broke above the $185‚Äì190 range, now eyeing $260‚Äì350 according to bullish chart patterns. Meanwhile, machine-learning forecasts and analyst chatter point toward a $300+ price if institutional momentum continues. Even ETFs tied to SOL are in motion, thanks to the SEC‚Äôs new 75-day approval window . Still, Solana holders understand that Solana‚Äôs future depends heavily on performance scaling and institutional demand. With some technicals signaling possible pullbacks, many are hedging bets, and they‚Äôre doing it with DeSoc. Unlike most altcoins, DeSoc isn‚Äôt riding chart hype. It‚Äôs offering utility from the ground up. Content syndication across major social media platforms, token rewards for creators, and real-time content monetization are DeSoc‚Äôs key offerings. DeSoc‚Äôs Rise Isn‚Äôt Hype; It‚Äôs Demand for Utility What makes DeSoc different is its focus on real engagement. Instead of building another financial protocol, DeSoc is creating a social ecosystem where value flows to creators, not platforms. With a built-in API that integrates with Instagram, TikTok, X, and more, DeSoc lets users post content across multiple platforms from one dashboard while retaining ownership and earning from it. And it's not just about content. $SOCS , DeSoc‚Äôs native token, powers everything from tipping and exclusive content access to peer-to-peer transactions and community governance. Users can monetize their posts, promote content, and even vote on protocol upgrades. At $0.01 per token, many see the current presale as a rare opportunity to get in early on something that could reshape how creators interact with their audiences. The tokenomics reinforce the project‚Äôs long-term potential. With 45% allocated to presale buyers, a 30-year liquidity lock, and a two-year lock on team tokens, DeSoc is showing it is committed to sustainability, not exit pumps. Why Investors are Shifting? It‚Äôs not that Cardano investors and Solana holders are abandoning their projects. It‚Äôs that they‚Äôre seeking exposure to something with more immediate, relatable value. Crypto isn‚Äôt just about decentralizing finance anymore. It is about decentralizing the web we all use daily, and DeSoc is tackling that head-on. The $10 million milestone in under two weeks shows just how quickly momentum can build when a project addresses both crypto-native users and everyday online behavior. Whether it‚Äôs through content monetization, governance participation, or token-based access models, DeSoc is doing what many Layer 1s haven‚Äôt: delivering practical tools people can use right now. For Solana holders and Cardano investors, DeSoc isn‚Äôt a replacement. It‚Äôs a smart addition to the portfolio, one that aligns with both the ethos of decentralization and the demand for usable platforms.

49691219,https://coinpaper.com/10407/coinbase-to-charge-higher-fees-for-usdc-to-usd-conversions,1754569364,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png,Coinbase to Charge Higher Fees for USDC to USD Conversions,https://coinpaper.com/10407/coinbase-to-charge-higher-fees-for-usdc-to-usd-conversions,"The move was announced after two consecutive quarters of missed earnings and is part of the exchange‚Äôs efforts to stabilize revenue. While Coinbase previously charged fees only above $40 million in conversions, the new threshold is a big shift. Senior product manager Will McComb called the policy an ‚Äúexperiment‚Äù amid backlash from users who compare it to traditional banking fees. Some analysts, however, suggest the fee may counter arbitrage involving Tether. Meanwhile, Coinbase is reigniting its expansion efforts in India, with legal chief Paul Grewal meeting Karnataka‚Äôs IT minister to explore blockchain development and public infrastructure projects. New Fee Hits Big USDC Conversions Coinbase will soon introduce a 0.1% fee on conversions of the stablecoin USDC to US dollars for net amounts of more than $5 million within a 30-day rolling period. This is expected to start on Aug. 13. The move comes as the crypto exchange grapples with financial challenges after two consecutive quarters of missed earnings expectations. In Q2, Coinbase reported $1.5 billion in revenue‚Äîwhich was below analysts‚Äô estimates‚Äîand saw its stock drop 8% after the results were released. Though stablecoin-related revenue increased 12% year-over-year to $332 million, the broader financial picture showed strain, including a 95% drop in net income in Q1 due to unrealized losses on crypto holdings. (Source: X ) Currently , Coinbase does not charge for net USDC-to-USD conversions under $40 million within a 30-day period. Above that threshold, fees start at 0.05% and increase to a maximum of 0.2% for conversions over $200 million. The newly introduced 0.1% fee for conversions above $5 million is a big change that is aimed at cost recovery and operational adjustment. Will McComb, Coinbase‚Äôs senior product manager for stablecoins, referred to the policy as an ‚Äúexperiment‚Äù that is intended to evaluate the impact of fees on USDC off-ramping. He acknowledged the community feedback and stated that Coinbase is still committed to being a top platform for stablecoin use. Critics, however, raised some concerns about the precedent it sets. Bankless co-founder Ryan Sean Adams even compared the change to traditional banking fees, warning of a slippery slope. Some in the crypto community suggest that the new fee is a response to growing arbitrage opportunities involving Tether. Crypto influencer Cobie pointed out that users were converting Tether (USDT), which has a high exit fee, into USDC to off-ramp for free, thereby shrinking USDC‚Äôs supply. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong agreed with this assessment, and replied with a simple ‚ÄúYep‚Äù to the explanation. Tether charges a 0.1% fee or a minimum of $1,000 for redemptions above $100,000. (Source: X ) Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart drew comparisons between Coinbase‚Äôs move and the create/redeem fees in ETFs, and suggested that Coinbase is passing on the cost of facilitating one-way flows in and out of USDC. While Coinbase may be absorbing some costs related to redemptions, it seems like the exchange is now shifting those costs to users through a tiered fee structure as it looks to stabilize revenue. Coinbase Reignites India Push Despite its challenges, Coinbase is still looking for opportunities to grow. Paul Grewal, the chief legal officer of Coinbase, recently met with Priyank Kharge, the IT minister of Karnataka, to explore its deeper involvement in India‚Äôs digital transformation. The meeting took place earlier this week, and shed some light on Coinbase‚Äôs interest in supporting India‚Äôs growing blockchain ecosystem, particularly in Karnataka. This is a state that is well known for its leadership in technology and innovation. Grewal shared some of his enthusiasm on X by stating that Coinbase plans to contribute to the region‚Äôs tech development through initiatives like developer tools, cybersecurity collaboration, and capacity-building programs. He also stated that ‚Äùthe future is on-chain ‚Äî and it‚Äôs being built here.‚Äù Minister Kharge confirmed the discussions, and revealed that Coinbase‚Äôs developer platform is simplifying blockchain development for local builders. The two parties also explored future collaborations, including training programs, incubation efforts, and potential joint hackathons. Kharge said the Karnataka government is very eager to explore blockchain technology for governance and digital public infrastructure. This is not the government‚Äôs first foray into blockchain. Back in 2017, Karnataka hosted a seminar on blockchain and Bitcoin to better understand the implications of the technology for governance and regulation. Coinbase‚Äôs outreach in Karnataka comes at a time when the exchange is seeking to re-establish its presence in India after regulatory hurdles forced it to scale back operations. In late 2023, Coinbase asked local users to withdraw funds as it discontinued retail services in the country. The company also halted support for the United Payments Interface (UPI) in April of 2022 just days after launching locally. However, recent developments suggest a shift in tone. Coinbase is reportedly in talks with Indian regulators and looking to re-engage with the market.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|USDC|BLOCKCHAIN|USDT|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-07 12:22:44

This story highlights the ongoing challenges faced by some significant players in the digital asset space. Greenidge Generation, a notable entity in the Bitcoin mining facility sector, recently agreed to a pivotal Greenidge sale . This strategic move involves offloading its Columbus, Mississippi, operation, signaling a direct response to persistent financial strain within the company. What‚Äôs Behind This Crucial Greenidge Sale? Greenidge Generation has reached an agreement to sell its Bitcoin mining facility located in Columbus, Mississippi. The purchaser is U.S. Digital Mining Mississippi, a unit of their competitor, LM Funding America. This transaction is valued at approximately $3.9 million, as disclosed in a recent U.S. SEC filing. The sale notably excludes the actual mining rigs and a nearby warehouse. The parties anticipate finalizing this deal by September 16, marking a significant transition for the site. Why the Financial Strain on Greenidge? The Columbus site, a 6.4-acre property, began operations in July 2024. Despite its recent establishment, Greenidge has faced considerable hurdles. A primary challenge has been managing a substantial debt burden. This financial pressure has undeniably impacted their operational flexibility. Moreover, tariffs imposed on imported equipment have significantly increased their costs, adding to the company‚Äôs overall financial strain and making efficient crypto mining more difficult. What Does This Mining Site Sale Mean for the Industry? The mining site sale by Greenidge offers a stark illustration of the volatile nature inherent in the crypto mining industry. Companies in this sector continuously navigate fluctuating Bitcoin prices, escalating energy expenses, and complex global supply chain dynamics. This strategic divestment by Greenidge could be a calculated move to consolidate resources, reduce debt, and potentially pivot towards more sustainable operations in the future of crypto mining . What‚Äôs Next for Bitcoin Mining Facilities and Their Operators? For Greenidge, this sale represents a critical step towards achieving greater financial stability. It may allow them to streamline their remaining operations or pursue new, less capital-intensive ventures. Conversely, LM Funding America, through its acquisition, is actively expanding its presence in the Bitcoin mining facility landscape. This move signals their confidence in the long-term potential of the sector. The industry will keenly watch how this change in ownership influences the site‚Äôs operational efficiency and overall contribution to the buyer‚Äôs portfolio. The Greenidge sale of its Mississippi Bitcoin mining facility powerfully underscores the intense pressures prevalent within the crypto mining domain. It serves as a compelling indicator that even established players must strategically adapt to significant financial strain , often leading to crucial asset divestments and a challenging environment for any new mining site sale . This event provides a vital reminder of the constant need for agility and robust financial foresight in the ever-evolving digital asset industry.
