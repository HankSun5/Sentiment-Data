The funding round was led by prominent venture capitalist firms Greenoaks and Joshua Kushner’s Thrive Capital, representing the growing footprint of cryptocurrency in mainstream finance and global capital markets. Tempo’s Valuation Climbs To $5B After Funding Round In a new post on Friday, Fortune reports that Stripe’s Tempo has recorded a successful Series A funding, pushing the blockchain’s valuation to $5 billion. In early September, Stripe announced Tempo in partnership with crypto VC Paradigm as a layer-1 blockchain designed to enable stablecoin payment and boost payment efficiency. In Paradigm’s announcement statement , the firm’s co-founder and managing director, Matt Huang, gave valuable insights on Tempo’s mission, saying: We are excited to further crypto’s ability to tackle real-world use cases, including global payments and payroll, remittances, tokenized deposits for 24/7 settlement, embedded financial accounts, microtransactions, agentic payments, and more. Tempo joins a list of growing stablecoin-focused layer 1 blockchains, including Circle’s Arc and Tether’s Plasma. Interestingly, its launch also comes following the adoption of a pro-crypto policy by US President Donald Trump, leading to several positive regulatory developments. In July, President Trump notably signed the GENIUS Act, establishing a federally approved framework to regulate the issuance and operation of stablecoins in the United States. Tempo represents Stripe’s bet on dollar-backed stablecoin’s potential to emerge as a key player in the global payment system. The blockchain project is jointly designed with global industry leaders, including Deutsche Bank, OpenAI, Standard Chartered, and Revolut, among others. Meanwhile, alongside Greenoaks and Thrive Capital, other participants in this funding round included Ribbit Capital, Sequoia, and Ron Conway’s SC Angel. Notably, Paradigm and Stripe made no equity contribution to this round. Stripe Presses On With Crypto Ambitions Beyond its investment in Tempo, Stripe’s expansion into crypto has accelerated in 2025. In February, the billion-dollar company acquired stablecoin startup Bridge for $1.1 billion, followed by a June deal to purchase crypto wallet company Privy. With Tempo, the payment company looks to gain a stronghold in the booming stablecoin market. While Stripe has not disclosed plans for a native Tempo token, the company has previously stated plans to remain agnostic. The company’s focus on blockchain payment infrastructure puts it in direct competition with established stablecoin players like Circle and Tether , and major blockchain networks such as Ethereum , Solana, and Tron. At press time, the total stablecoin market cap is $316.52 billion with a daily trading volume of $238 billion.",Crypto News|Layer 1 blockchain|Paradigm|stablecoin|Stripe|Tempo,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|REGULATION|USDT,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-18 19:30:20

Related Reading: Bitcoin Plunges To $105k As Investors Shift To Gold After Crypto Carnage His clip argues that as long as many traders expect quick rebounds and hold long bets, the market can keep sliding until optimism is gone. But, it was the “car crash” and “losing your entire family” and having an arm amputated in an accident part that sounded disturbing. It was all a metaphor about the reality of investing in Bitcoin and that everything could get worse. At least, in the way he sees it. On Psychology & Risk Tate’s message was mostly dark and foreboding. He spoke about pain, suffering and how too much expectation can wreck people’s dreams. His message enters on market psychology: too many people still thinking price won’t go lower, which is the worst part — and that keeps risk alive. He framed the move as a capitulation or “amputation” — a moment when traders finally give up and positions are cleared. Several crypto outlets picked up the clip and reposted short videos of his comments across X and Instagram. Market data gives context to why his warning grabbed attention. Bitcoin recently pulled back from highs earlier in October and traded near the $106,000–$107,000 area on October 17, with large liquidations hitting futures and options desks. BITCOIN IS GOING TO $26,000 pic.twitter.com/Ng8ntmjWow — Andrew Tate (@Cobratate) October 17, 2025 Reports show hundreds of millions cleared from leveraged positions in the recent sell-off. That kind of forced selling can amplify moves in either direction. Market Moves And Data Points Other outlets pointed out outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs on days when prices slid, evidence that institutional flows can swing quickly and affect liquidity. Some coverage named single-day ETF outflows in the hundreds of millions, underscoring how fragile demand can look in a down leg. At the same time, a few market vets argued that these drops create buying chances for longer-term players. Observers split on probability. Some analysts warn that a deep correction is possible if broad liquidity dries up or if macro shocks hit risk assets. Others note that structural change — like larger custody flows and ETF frameworks — creates more buyers than in past cycles, which could make a plunge to $26,000 unlikely without a major external shock. Related Reading: Biggest Shiba Inu Burn In Months — And It Came From A Coinbase Account What Traders Should Watch Meanwhile, key numbers to watch are support near four-figure and five-figure levels that traders have flagged this week, liquidations across futures, and ETF flows in and out of spot products. Momentum indicators versus gold and on-chain metrics have also been highlighted by some outlets as signs of whether sellers are exhausted or just getting started. In short, Tate’s $26,000 call is a bold, simple forecast built on a sentiment argument. It is newsworthy because it came from a widely followed figure and because crypto is volatile right now. But it is one scenario among many.

One DeFi crypto capturing attention is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , currently priced at just $0.035 in Phase 6 of its presale, with over 70% sold out and more than $17.6 million raised. MUTM’s innovative dual-lending DeFi model, which combines Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract liquidity pools, allows users to lend and borrow efficiently within a single ecosystem, providing real-world utility alongside speculative potential. Analysts and early investors suggest that, with its presale momentum and strong community backing, Mutuum Finance could become the next crypto coin to explode, making it a better opportunity for both ETH millionaires and new investors seeking exposure to a high-potential DeFi project. Why Ethereum (ETH) Millionaires Are Changing Their Bets Ethereum (ETH) is trading at below $4,000 currently, which indicates short-term weakness but the bulls are unable to gain control, yet long-term fundamentals are still intact, thus making tactical bets by experienced ETH investors. With immediate resistance at $4,000 and its crucial accumulation zone between $3,000 and $2,600, millionaires are exercising maximum prudence while positioning for the next move, using dips as opportunities to re-accumulate in anticipation of targets higher up towards $8,000–$10,000. This strategy of accumulating reflects a macro strategy of capitalizing on volatility without deviating from Ethereum’s long-term bullish trajectory. As ETH investors branch out and look for alternative high-potential opportunities beyond established networks, attention increasingly is turning to new DeFi crypto initiatives and future-oriented crypto tokens that can be used to enhance legacy positions, and so here is growing interest Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the next crypto coin to explode. Mutuum Finance as the Best Cryptocurrency to Invest in Now Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly turning into a top crypto project within the DeFi space and among the top cryptos to buy for the near and long terms. Its presale already stands at Stage 6 and has so far registered robust adoption among the crypto community with a combined total of 17,300+ investors contributing over $17.6 million. They observed that such growing demand and consistent investor confidence position MUTM as a viable contender, supported by real DeFi crypto use cases and solid growth, making it one of the next crypto coin to explode in the decentralized finance market. Currently, over 70% of Phase 6 has already sold out, signaling accelerating demand as investors rush to secure tokens before the next price jump. Once this phase concludes, the MUTM price will rise by 20%, moving closer to the $0.06 launch value. With each stage offering fewer tokens at higher prices, early buyers are locking in positions ahead of what analysts describe as a strong post-listing upside. Mutuum Finance Leaderboard MUTM is also introducing friendly competition in the presale with its leaderboard in the presale. The top five largest investors in the last 24 hours purchased $1,704, $1,291, $1,000, $734, and $685 MUTM tokens respectively, a gauge of increasing interest and activity at the grassroots level. There is also the $500 MUTM bonus for the number 1 buyer on a day-to-day basis as an incentive feature designed to reward and encourage frequent activity. A member qualifies after making one purchase within the 24-hour window, and thus it is very simple for anyone to join and rise through the ranks. Crypto news today reports have highlighted that such community-based mechanisms are giving MUTM instant exposure as the next cryptocurrency to reach $1 in the DeFi crypto space and a likely next crypto coin to explode in 2025. Mutuum Finance Lending and Borrowing Protocol One of the top altcoins to invest in right now that is further consolidating its hold is Mutuum Finance. It is gearing up to release its most anticipated lending and borrowing protocol . V1 (Version 1) coming out in Q4 2025 that will be rolled out in the Sepolia Testnet will possess all the essential features of a full DeFi system, including liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and liquidator bot. Users will be able to lend, borrow, and collateralize ETH and USDT from the very launch date and enjoy the advantage of possessing a safe, rapid, and scalable decentralized finance platform. As Ethereum millionaires diversify, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being positioned as a high-growth DeFi crypto project. Having already raised over $17.6M from 17,300+ investors and its Phase 6 already 70% sold out, its twin-lending model and impending release of Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 makes it one of the best cryptos to invest in today, and perhaps even the next crypto coin to explode as the market heads into the next bull cycle.

Three names are capturing the attention of investors and analysts alike: Shiba Inu, Aster, and the rapidly rising newcomer Based Eggman . This month’s crypto price analysis reveals that each of these projects offers a distinct value proposition, with Shiba Inu holding steady as a leading memecoin, Aster pushing the boundaries with next-gen smart contracts, and Based Eggman shaking up the sector as a new cryptocurrency with viral potential and real utility. Shiba Inu Price Analysis October 2025: Is the Memecoin Rally Ready? Often topping the list of best crypto price prediction models, Shiba Inu remains a heavyweight in the memecoin space. After a volatile summer, the latest Shiba Inu price analysis October 2025 shows SHIB consolidating above major support at $0.000009706, with whale accumulation on the rise according to on-chain data. For those looking to buy Shiba Inu, analysts suggest that any renewed social momentum or ecosystem update could trigger a short-term rally, though long-term growth may depend on the broader adoption of the ShibaSwap platform and further utility enhancements to the Shiba Inu memecoin. Aster Price Prediction: Smart Contract Growth Fuels Optimism As a new cryptocurrency making waves in the DeFi and Web3 space, Aster has seen impressive adoption over the past year. The current Aster price analysis points to steady upward momentum, with price predictions targeting potential new highs if the project continues to expand its dApp ecosystem and attract developer talent. Aster’s focus on cross-chain compatibility and user-friendly staking positions it as one of the best crypto to buy now for those seeking exposure to cutting-edge blockchain tech. Should the network secure additional partnerships or CEX listings this quarter, bullish scenarios could see Aster breaking previous resistance and establishing itself as a serious contender in the layer-1 race. Based Eggman: Newcomer with Viral Potential and Real Utility Rounding out the top three is Based Eggman , a new entrant that’s quickly gaining attention both as a meme and as a utility-driven project. With a presale price offering accessibility at just $0.0086, Based Eggman is making headlines as a new cryptocurrency that blends the viral appeal of classic memecoins with actual ecosystem integration—such as gaming, social-Fi features, and staking rewards. Unlike many first-generation meme tokens, Based Eggman’s roadmap prioritizes real use cases on the Base blockchain, drawing early interest from both retail and whale investors. For those seeking the best crypto price prediction with high growth potential, $GGs stands out as a speculative but promising play for October 2025. Conclusion: The Best Cryptos to Buy in October 2025 What sets Based Eggman apart—and makes it arguably the best crypto to buy now—is its unique ability to combine the explosive viral energy of traditional memecoins with the tangible, long-term value of a utility token. While Shiba Inu relies heavily on community momentum and Aster’s growth depends on developer adoption, Based Eggman is carving out its own niche by delivering real use cases from day one, including integrated gaming, social-Fi, and staking rewards on the Base blockchain. Its accessible presale price of $0.0086 creates a low barrier to entry with significant upside, and its rapidly expanding community is attracting both seasoned crypto whales and newcomers alike. For investors looking for a project positioned at the intersection of meme culture and genuine ecosystem value, Based Eggman offers a fresh opportunity to capture early gains in a way that both Shiba Inu and Aster, with their larger market caps and slower growth potential, may not match in the months ahead.

Both have rapidly gained recognition as the top memecoins to buy this season, thanks to their unique community-driven narratives, robust growth potential, and ability to capture the imagination of traders searching for the next big win. In this in-depth look, we’ll explore why these projects top the list for those seeking the best crypto to buy in October 2025, and why SPX coin, in particular, could deliver a market-shocking performance. SPX6900 Coin: Viral Momentum and the Next Big Meme Movement SPX6900 coin has quickly emerged as a standout in the memecoin ecosystem, blending irreverent internet culture with a highly engaged online following. The token’s rise has been fueled by a series of viral marketing campaigns, influencer endorsements, and a dedicated meme army, making it a top memecoin for those looking to capitalize on social-driven momentum. According to the most recent SPX6900 price prediction reports, SPX is poised for further rallies, with analysts highlighting its breakout potential as fresh capital flows into the memecoin segment. What sets SPX memecoin apart is its ability to continuously innovate and surprise the market. From gamified community events to bold roadmap updates, SPX is not just another fleeting trend—it’s a movement with staying power. Many investors now consider it the best memecoin to buy for October, betting that its next major announcement or viral moment could trigger a price surge that shocks even seasoned market watchers. Based Eggman ($GGs): Social-Fi Innovation and Early Adoption Advantage While SPX6900 dominates the meme narrative with its shock factor, Based Eggman ($GGs) is quietly building a powerful ecosystem on the Base blockchain—setting it apart as one of the best memecoins to buy for those interested in utility and long-term engagement. $GGs leverages social-Fi incentives, gaming rewards, and a vibrant community to deliver an interactive experience where every holder can participate and benefit. Its presale success and growing user base have cemented Based Eggman’s place among the top memecoins to buy for early adopters looking to maximize future returns. The combination of low transaction fees, rapid development, and community-driven growth makes Based Eggman a memecoin to invest in for anyone seeking more than just hype. As more traders recognize the project’s innovation and its potential to scale, the case for $GGs as the best crypto to buy this October grows stronger. Why These Memecoins Top the List for October 2025 For those assembling a portfolio of the best crypto to buy October 2025, diversification is key. SPX6900 coin offers explosive, meme-fueled upside, while Based Eggman provides a platform for sustained engagement and ecosystem rewards. Both tokens are seeing increased inflows from traders and influencers seeking the next 10x opportunity, and their communities are driving the kind of organic buzz that often precedes massive moves. If you’re looking for the top memecoin or the best memecoin to buy in this cycle, combining the viral potential of SPX6900 with the innovative foundation of Based Eggman could offer the perfect balance of risk and reward. Their complementary strengths highlight why these two tokens are the top memecoins to buy in October 2025.

How Low Will XRP Go?,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-to-xrp-investors-i-told-you-this-would-happen-how-low-will-xrp-go/,"The recent dip in XRP has stirred anxiety across the crypto market, as traders struggle to make sense of a sharp correction that seems to have caught many off guard. Yet, according to prominent market analyst Austin Hilton, this was not an unpredictable event—it was the outcome of geopolitical tensions that have been brewing for weeks. As Hilton put it, “This is something that I did tell you would play out, and how it will play out is exactly how it’s going.” The Global Shock The U.S.–China trade war has once again rippled through global markets, affecting stocks, commodities, and digital assets alike. The latest escalation centers on rare earth minerals, essential components in high-tech manufacturing and renewable energy technologies. China currently controls about 44% of global rare earth reserves, while the U.S. holds just 1.9%, making Washington’s recent tariff hikes a high-stakes move. I told you this would happen with XRP! How low will XRP go? pic.twitter.com/2f5N3vwncg — Austin Hilton (@austinahilton) October 17, 2025 Last week, President Donald Trump announced 100% tariffs on Chinese imports, which Hilton described as a “nuclear bomb” for the global economy. The ripple effect was immediate—markets across the world trembled, and XRP wasn’t spared . Hilton explained, “This continues to be the fallout from the United States versus China trade war… it was initially about rare earth minerals, and that’s a big deal to everybody in the world.” XRP’s Reaction: Volatility Returns As the market digested the news, XRP briefly wicked down to $1.25 before recovering above the $2 mark. As of report time, the token trades around $2.34, according to CoinMarketCap , reflecting ongoing volatility as traders weigh macroeconomic uncertainty. Hilton believes the reaction is not unique to XRP but part of a wider risk-off sentiment affecting the entire crypto market. “You look out there—Dogecoin down ten percent, Tron down, Cardano down nine, that’s what’s playing out right now,” he noted. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Despite the turbulence, Hilton advised calm and discipline. “Do I want XRP to go below $2? Hell no. I own both of those [Bitcoin and XRP],” he said. “But this is simply not going to end tomorrow… these are complicated multi-trillion-dollar problems we’re dealing with here.” How Low Will XRP Go? Hilton’s short-term outlook suggests that XRP could still dip further before stabilizing . He reiterated that “we’ll probably see XRP go below $2,” attributing the move to the continued fallout from tariff uncertainty rather than any failure in Ripple’s fundamentals or network performance. Technical analysts point to $1.80 as a key support level; if the price falls below that, the next psychological floor lies near $1.50. However, many long-term holders view such dips as buying opportunities amid broader adoption trends and Ripple’s expanding financial partnerships. Hilton’s Message: Don’t Panic, Keep Perspective Hilton closed his message on a reassuring note, urging XRP investors to zoom out from the noise. “Crypto is not gonna wither and die—it may feel like that when you are in the middle of it day-to-day. Get away from it. Go touch grass, walk your dog, spend time with family. This is where we’re at now, guys. This is reality.” While short-term volatility may test investors’ patience, Hilton’s broader point resonates: macroeconomic shocks often shake out weak hands before paving the way for stronger rebounds. With the U.S.–China trade war still evolving, XRP’s path may remain rocky—but for those with long-term conviction, this downturn could be the calm before another historic rally.

According to the post, a group likely controlled by a single individual or organization is using numerous addresses to withdraw BNB from Binance. These addresses are processing thousands of high-frequency transactions for dozens of different tokens daily. Over the past 30 days, each address has reportedly traded over 250 different tokens, processing hundreds of thousands of transactions. Related News: Founder of This Altcoin Bought a Significant Amount of His Own Token: The Price Chart Turned Green The Data Nerd argued that activity on this scale exhibits a pattern more typical of automated trading bots than individual investors or project teams. It was also noted that these addresses had recently traded COAI tokens, but generally did not “buy the dip” and instead operated in a continuous buy-sell cycle. This behavior was likened to the trading strategies of arbitrage or mining bots rather than memecoin insiders. *This is not investment advice.

The founder added that 50% of the token supply will be given to OG users while sharing minimal tokenomics details. OpenSea is transforming into a full trading platform that will include both fungible and non-fungible tokens. “This is just the beginning of our transformation, from ‘NFT marketplace’ to ‘trade everything,'” said Finzer on X. He further added that the wave of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in 2021 was just the first chapter in OpenSea’s journey, which brought a ton of artists, musicians, gamers, and collectors on-chain. OpenSea to reward OG users Finzer said that 50% of SEA tokens will be given to the platform’s supporters, mainly OG users and participants in the ongoing rewards program. In the joint announcement with the OpenSea Foundation , Finzer explained, “The Foundation has confirmed that 50% of supply will be allocated to the community, with more than half awarded via an initial claim. Both OGs and those who participated in OpenSea rewards programs will be meaningfully considered, separately.” Moreover, half of the revenue collected during SEA’s launch will be used for token buyback. The SEA token will power the newly transformed OpenSea platform. Users can stake SEA to support their favorite token or NFT collectibles. The OpenSea Foundation has been teasing the SEA token since February. However, OpenSea did not disclose more details about the token, such as the total supply and other tokenomics details.

Currently, it charges 0.9% fees on every transaction, ensuring a steady stream of revenue. NFTs are still a big part of OpenSea, used for airdrops and other perks. Additionally, OpenSea wants to tap the perpetual futures contracts known as perps. The platform wants to mimic successful perp DEXs like Hyperliquid and Aster, hoping to secure a share in this market.

The event caused widespread liquidations across the derivatives market and rattled trader confidence, leaving market sentiment deeply shaken. On-chain data from CryptoQuant shows that Bitcoin’s open interest variation fell to negative 25 in the aftermath of the flash crash, its lowest reading in 2025. This decline highlights a market that has been cleansed of excessive leverage, but the question is whether this points to a major rebound or the start of a deeper correction. Bitcoin Open Interest Sinks Into Extreme Fear Territory According to on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, Bitcoin’s open interest variation , an indicator measuring changes in the total number of active futures contracts, recently entered the Extreme Fear zone. Particularly, the open interest reached a low of around negative 25 points, its lowest level so far in 2025. This metric had previously reached similar lows during BTC’s last major correction earlier in the year, when it dropped to around negative 25. However, the last time the Bitcoin open interest dropped below this negative 25 level was in mid-2023. The latest reading around negative 25 shows the intense market capitulation , where over-leveraged traders were flushed out when BTC touched $101,000. Similar drops so far this year have shown moments of extreme pessimism but were followed by renewed strength once the selling pressure subsided. Each time open interest collapsed to this degree, Bitcoin’s price found support soon after and began a steady recovery in the following weeks. This recurring pattern suggests that extreme deleveraging often precedes the formation of local or macro bottoms. What Does This Mean For Bitcoin? If the crash in open interest follows a price drop, it often indicates a wave of long liquidations. This type of extremely low open interest means that most leverage traders has been fully flushed from the system, and the market is now cleaner. In such cases, it can actually be bullish in the medium and long terms. As shown in the chart above, the last time open interest fell to negative 25 was in early April, when BTC finally ended its extended correction from above $106,000 at $76,300. What happened after was months of uptrends that finally saw Bitcoin break above $106,000 again and into new all-time highs. A similar performance and comparable rebound would project BTC’s price to undergo a steady 40% to 50% increase over the next multiple months. This steady increase would send Bitcoin price action back above $150,000 by early 2026. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $106,900, up by 1.4% in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Bitcoin's Open Interest|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|CryptoQuant,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-18 21:00:26

More shockingly, on-chain data has surfaced that paints a pessimistic yet uncertain picture of the cryptocurrency’s future. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Falls To $103,000: Is This The End Of The Bull Run Or A Prequel To The Next Surge? $100,000 Emerges As Key Support Zone In a recent X post on Friday, CryptoQuant analyst Julio Moreno shared insights from his technical analysis of the Bitcoin price action. Moreno highlighted that Bitcoin’s most recent break beneath what was a price consolidation range of $120,000-$108,000 has caused a shift of attention towards $100,000 as the next critical level. The crypto analyst defended his report with the Bitcoin Trader On-chain Realized Price Bands metric, which measures the lower boundary of the average on-chain acquisition cost for Bitcoin short-term holders. Simply, this metric helps identify the price level that would act as support in cases where the price experiences corrective movement. From the chart shared above, $100.9k is currently the lower boundary of the average trader realized price, one that Moreno expects could serve as a support zone. Aside from technical analysis and on-chain activity, $100,000 is also a significant psychological price level, as it serves as the hallmark where Bitcoin enters a six-figure valuation. If the Bitcoin price were to fall to levels as low as $100,000, the strong psychological backing by market participants could translate to its price action. As a result, the flagship cryptocurrency could see temporary relief from the bearish pressure that it is currently under. Related Reading: Solana Meme Economy: The Culture That Drives Billions In Volume – Here’s How What Next For Bitcoin? As was previously mentioned, $100,000 stands as a significant level for the Bitcoin price, with psychology and technical analysis coming together to reinforce its importance. Derivable from Moreno’s post is the conjecture that if the $100,000 support were to hold, Bitcoin’s bullish sentiment among market participants could be renewed, thus setting the pace for the flagship cryptocurrency’s recovery towards its current all-time-high price. On the other hand, the failure of this important price level could carry grave implications, especially for short-term holders. A break in this psychological support could trigger a sharp sentiment shift amongst Bitcoin market participants, causing them to sell their holdings to minimize losses or escape with some profits. Interestingly, the 365-day Moving Average (MA) sits around the $100,000 psychological support. For context, the 365-day MA is a technical indicator that shows Bitcoin’s average closing price over the past year. By extension of its primary function, the indicator is used to gauge Bitcoin’s direction in the long term. If Bitcoin should therefore slip beneath its 365-day MA of $100,000, it could be a sign that the digital asset is about to assume a long-term bearish trajectory, a sign which might precede major price corrections. As of this writing, Bitcoin is worth approximately $107,400, showing a 7-day loss of more than 5% of its value.

While the dip spooked some short-term holders, seasoned investors see it as a buying opportunity, not a red flag. The surge in trading volume by over 34% suggests that smart money is accumulating again, anticipating a bounce toward the $200–$250 zone. But what’s truly sparking excitement isn’t just Solana’s price recovery; it’s the emerging rotation into undervalued altcoins showing early-stage momentum. Among these, MAGACOIN FINANCE is fast becoming the FOMO-driven pick of the season, attracting investors looking for outsized returns and early entry into what some analysts call a potential 100x opportunity heading into 2025. Solana Price Prediction — Testing the $175 Support Zone The recent market dip has caught several investors and traders off guard as SOL tested the $175 support level. Despite the dip, Solana’s trading volume has demonstrated resilience as it surged by 34.35% with 12.07B in the last 24 hours. Solana Price Chart: CoinGecko Solana recently re-entered the descending channel pattern, but the bears halted the relief rally at the 20-day EMA ($210) on Tuesday. The $190 level is the near-term support to watch out for. If the price continues lower and breaks below $190, it signals that the bears are in control. The Solana price could then tumble to $168. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns up and breaks above the moving averages, it suggests that the bulls are back in the driver’s seat. The SOL/USDT pair could rally to $238 and later to $260. The Hidden 100x ROI Altcoin Investors Are Watching As Solana fights to recover from its $180 breakdown, early investors are quietly stacking MAGACOIN FINANCE for 100x potential . Investment professionals are referring to it as a next-gen altcoin that has all the makings of transparency, community, and sustainable tokenomics. These are the features that early investors look out for before a breakout occurs. Early traction of the project is developing fast due to growing demand among early buyers and MAGACOIN FINANCE is being tipped as one of the best crypto to buy for investors targeting significant returns. It is currently undervalued at less than $1, and analysts believe that the token will see substantial returns in the near future. Conclusion Solana’s drop below $180 may prove to be one of 2025’s most talked-about buying zones if the rebound continues. But the real story shaping up is the growing investor migration toward undervalued gems like MAGACOIN FINANCE. MAGACOIN FINANCE has been fully audited and verified by Hashex , confirming its smart-contract integrity and investor protection. Analysts note that few presales offer this level of transparent, certified security backed by Certik review. As the market prepares for another bullish cycle, the narrative of price recovery meets early opportunity is fueling urgency across trading circles. For those watching from the sidelines, the combination of SOL’s rebound potential and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s 100x speculation could mark the beginning of a new wave of crypto momentum, and missing the entry might just be the biggest risk of all.

While price action may appear muted, technical indicators suggest that a significant move could be developing. History has shown that XRP’s major rallies often begin when sentiment is at its lowest—precisely the kind of environment traders are witnessing today. Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto has once again drawn attention to XRP’s long-term technical picture, arguing that the charts are revealing a massive opportunity few are seeing. His latest analysis, shared on X, merges Elliott Wave Theory with the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Ribbon on the monthly chart—two tools that have historically pinpointed the start of explosive XRP uptrends. Wave 4 Consolidation: The Calm Before the Next Impulse According to Egrag, XRP is currently completing its Wave 4 correction, a common pause following the powerful Wave 3 advance. In Elliott Wave Theory, Wave 4 typically retraces about 23.6% to 38.2% of Wave 3, representing a consolidation phase before the next major surge—Wave 5. Egrag’s calculations show that Wave 3 extended from around $1.40 to $3.65, and by applying a 1.618 Fibonacci extension, the projected Wave 5 target lands near $7.29. This aligns with the broader $7–$8 target zone, which Egrag describes as consistent with a “macro secular bullish count.” In this framework, XRP’s current cycle would mark only the beginning of a much larger, long-term trend. #XRP – EMA Ribbon Massive Indication: ($8 – $20 – $27) : Trust In TA: I know many of you cannot see it but TA and Numbers is stating it bluntly.

I’ve… pic.twitter.com/zldKRMx6up — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) October 18, 2025 The EMA Ribbon: Historical Indicator of Parabolic Moves Beyond the wave structure, Egrag highlights the EMA Ribbon on XRP’s monthly chart as a key signal for timing major moves. The EMA Ribbon, a cluster of exponential moving averages, acts as a dynamic zone of support and resistance. Historically, every major XRP rally—such as those seen in 2017 and 2021—began shortly after the price dipped into the EMA Ribbon. Egrag points out that XRP has recently touched this region once again, suggesting the setup for another upward expansion. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 By comparing previous cycles, he identifies potential measured move targets: Around $8 , if the 2021 pattern repeats. Around $27, if the 2017 cycle mirrors again . The average between these two is approximately $20, forming what Egrag calls the “macro target band.” Market Sentiment and Trader Psychology Egrag also acknowledges the growing anxiety within the XRP community. He notes that his inbox has been flooded with messages from traders worried about the recent dip. Yet, he emphasizes that such emotions are typical during Wave 4 corrections, which often mislead traders into premature selling before the next bullish phase begins. His message is clear: trust the technicals, not the fear. Historically, when traders capitulated near the EMA Ribbon, those moments turned out to be prime accumulation opportunities. The Broader Outlook As of mid-October 2025, XRP trades near the $2 mark, well below the targets suggested by the Elliott Wave and EMA Ribbon models. Still, technical confidence among analysts like Egrag reflects a broader belief that XRP remains structurally bullish. If the Wave 5 scenario unfolds as projected, XRP could be gearing toward one of its most significant price expansions since 2017. However, traders should remain mindful of macroeconomic conditions and manage risk accordingly—because while technicals provide probabilities, not certainties, the alignment of XRP’s EMA and wave structure may be signaling a pivotal moment ahead.

The platform has allocated over $644.64 million in revenue to repurchase its HYPE tokens through its Assistance Fund, which represents 46% of all token buyback spending this year. In fact, Hyperliquid’s buyback efforts are equivalent to the combined spending of the next nine largest buybacks. HYPE Buybacks Overshadow Market To date, at least 21.36 million HYPE tokens have been repurchased. This figure accounted for roughly 2.1% of the total supply. Monthly buybacks have averaged $65.50 million, fluctuating from $39.14 million in March to a peak of $110.62 million in August, with an average repurchase price of $30.18 per HYPE. To put this into perspective, LayerZero ranks as the second largest token buyback, having spent $150 million in September to repurchase 5% of its ZRO supply, with an average price of $3.00. However, this was a one-off discretionary buyback, and CoinGecko expects Hyperliquid’s ongoing program to maintain its dominance. Meanwhile, Pump.fun occupied the third spot as it spent $138.17 million on repurchases since July, averaging $40.47 million per month, and capturing 3% of its total supply. While Pump.fun’s average buyback price of $0.0046 places its repurchased tokens at a paper loss following the October 10 crypto crash, the program demonstrates a strategic approach to supply management. Raydium, the Solana-based DEX, leads in token buyback-and-burn activity after spending $100.35 million since 2022. Other notable projects include Rollbit ($27.93 million), Bonk via Bonk.fun ($27.30 million), Tron’s Sun platform ($3.03 million), and exchange WOO ($1.68 million). Overall, CoinGecko identified 28 projects implementing meaningful buybacks in 2025, amidst a growing trend in the industry as projects explore buybacks as a mechanism to return value to holders and incentivize long-term engagement. Token Buybacks Boom Zooming out, token buybacks have surged to over $1.40 billion so far in 2025. The trend was largely fueled by Hyperliquid. On average, crypto projects have spent roughly $146 million per month repurchasing their tokens this year. A significant spike in September’s figures was linked to LayerZero’s one-off $150 million repurchase, though CoinGecko clarified that this announcement likely distorted month-to-month comparisons. Excluding that, September’s total buyback spending stood at $168.45 million. Interestingly, the pace of buybacks has accelerated in the second half of 2025 as spending saw a jump of 85% month-on-month in July. As of mid-October, projects have already spent almost $89 million, putting the month on course to log a fourth straight period above the first-half average of over $99 million.

Ripple already holds a substantial amount of XRP, with the company’s market report revealing it has 4.5 billion XRP tokens, and another 37 billion tokens locked in escrow. Ripple Labs To Lead $1 Billion Fundraise Ripple Labs is reportedly launching a fundraising effort to purchase $1 billion worth of its XRP tokens, to be held in a digital asset treasury, according to a report by Bloomberg. The company is organizing the fundraiser through a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC. The new digital asset treasury will consist of freshly purchased XRP tokens. Additionally, Ripple Labs will also add to the stash from its own XRP stockpile. However, the exact terms of the transaction are still being discussed and could change before the deal is signed. “JUST IN: RIPPLE LABS TO LEAD $1B FUNDRAISE VIA SPAC TO ACCUMULATE XRP FOR NEW DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY.” Big Market Moves Ripple Labs also announced the purchase of GTreasury, a Chicago-based corporate treasury management firm, for $1 billion, making it the company’s third major acquisition of 2025. According to sources, the deal will give Ripple Labs the tools to manage digital assets held in corporate treasuries. Assets include stablecoins and tokenized deposits that can generate yield for clients. GTreasury’s treasury management software will work with Ripple’s blockchain infrastructure, allowing funds to be accessed around the clock, providing near-instant settlement for cross-border transactions. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse stated that the acquisition addresses problems with slow payment systems, adding that money has been stuck in outdated infrastructure, which causes delays and high costs. The purchase comes after Ripple acquired Hidden Road, a prime brokerage firm, in 2025. It also acquired stablecoin platform Rail during the same period. Ripple Could Become The Largest XRP Treasury Ripple Labs currently holds over 4,5 billion XRP out of a total supply of 59 billion XRP. If the company moves forward with the treasury plan and executes its $ billion buy, it will scoop up an additional 427 million XRP. The company also has an additional 37 billion tokens locked in escrow. Tokens from the escrow are released monthly, with some being sold and others being returned to escrow. Currently, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) lead the crypto treasury race. Institutional investors hold $152 billion in BTC and $23 billion in ETH. XRP has not seen as enthusiastic a response. However, several firms plan to establish an XRP reserve. Trident Digital Tech Holdings, a Web3 company based in Singapore, plans to establish an XRP treasury of up to $500 million. Meanwhile, Chinese AI company Webus plans to allocate $300 million towards an XRP treasury while VivoPower plans to accumulate $100 million worth of XRP tokens.

Safe haven bets clearly favored gold as the asset’s market cap surged to a record $30 trillion, up 18% over the past month. Some analysts believe BTC’s bull run could be over, warning that it risks a 50% correction. Bitcoin ETFs Shed Over $1 Billion Spot Bitcoin ETFs shed over $1.2 billion this week as Bitcoin plunged to multi-month lows. The eleven US spot Bitcoin ETFs registered an aggregate outflow of $366 million on Friday, rounding off a bearish week for the asset and its associated investment products. BlackRock’s IBIT registered the largest outflows with $268.6 million, followed by Fidelity, which lost $67.2 million. Grayscale’s GBTC registered outflows of $25 million, while Valkyrie’s ETF registered minor outflows. Friday’s outflows brought the total outflows for the week to $1.22 billion. The outflows came as Bitcoin shed over $10,000 to slip below $104,000 on Friday before rebounding to current levels. Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX Group, stated, “We see the current slump as largely the aftershock of last weekend's historic liquidation event, compounded by broader market uncertainty and some disappointment around October's underwhelming performance. That said, the fundamental outlook remains intact — the crypto market structure looks constructive, and we expect pullbacks to be met with strong support.” Liquidations registered another spike over the past 24 hours, with data from CoinGlass revealing $1.23 billion was liquidated from the market. Bitcoin Bull Run On Its Last Legs Analyst CryptoBird believes Bitcoin only has a few days of price expansion left if it follows historical patterns from previous bull runs. The analyst stated in a post on X, “Bull run ends in 10 days. Cycle Peak Countdown says BTC is 99.3% done (1,058 days in) as we shake out weak hands in classic pre-peak pattern. Are we in a bear market or is there more upside?” The analyst stated that the Cycle Peak Countdown shows that Bitcoin is 99% done with its upside. “1,058 days since cycle low = 99.3% complete, with only 0.7% remains of this historic bull cycle. Our October 24 target is exactly 10 days away.” According to CryptoBird, the ongoing pullback is right on schedule, adding that it is “classic pre-peak behavior.” Additionally, BTC’s drop below key support levels has led to structural weaknesses, potentially leading to a deeper correction. Analyst Daan Crypto Trades stated in a post on X, “ BTC is losing its Daily 200MA & EMA for the first time since April. With that, also the local support level at ~$107K is lost. Now testing the .786 fibonacci retracement level from this move up, and also when measuring from the wick on other exchanges. The Coinbase pair didn't go as low. Lose this zone and the June lows are on the board. This was the main region I've been waiting for so let's see what we get. Touching grass if bulls can't manage to hold this level this week.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) plunged to an intraday low of $103,516 on Friday, dropping to a multi-month low as selling pressure intensified. The flagship cryptocurrency has rebounded during the ongoing session, trading around $106,774. While prices are stressed, Strike CEO Jack Mallers believes Bitcoin could benefit from any liquidity crisis that follows if regional banks continue to face renewed stress. Mallers sees the banking stress as validation that BTC is pricing in an impending liquidity crisis, and that the Federal Reserve’s response will ultimately drive prices higher. Mallers stated, “Bitcoin is accurately smelling trouble right now. The US is going to have to inject some of that sweet, sweet liquidity soon and print a ton of money, or else its fiat empire goes kaboom. Bitcoin is the most sensitive to liquidity. It moves first. It’s a truth machine. Yields are puking, spreads are blowing out, and banks are stressed. Bitcoin is working. It smells of trouble. When they’re forced to print, it’ll move first again, and outperform everything.” The banking crisis is a repeat of the 2023 regional banking crisis. Analysts believe that the crisis was never truly resolved, but only papered over with bailouts and acquisitions. Some traders and analysts warned of a potential drop below the key $100,000 level, with prices potentially falling to $98,000 if this support was breached. Meanwhile, others saw an attempt to fill a daily candle wick from last week that took prices down to $102,000 on Binance. BTC failed to stay above key levels in its latest downturn, with analysts warning there is almost no support until the $101,000 level. Crypto investor Ted Pillows stated, “ BTC has lost the $108,000 support level. Now there’s little to no support until $101,000-$102,000. If Bitcoin manages to reclaim the $110,000 level from here, we could see a bounce back. Otherwise, expect more pain before relief.” BTC and the crypto market crashed on Friday after President Trump announced 100% tariffs on Chinese goods and new export controls for software. The announcement was made in retaliation for China's imposition of restrictions on rare earth mineral exports. As a result, BTC plunged to $102,000 on Binance before recovering and settling at $112,980. Selling pressure persisted on Saturday as the price fell almost 2% to $110,768. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, markets recovered on Sunday. As a result, BTC rose nearly 4% to reclaim $115,000 and settle at $115,067. Source: TradingView The price faced selling pressure and volatility on Monday, ultimately registering a marginal increase and settling at $115,274. Selling pressure returned on Tuesday as BTC fell to an intraday low of $109,945. It recovered from this level to reclaim $113,000 and settle at $113,068, ultimately dropping 1.91%. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as the price fell 2% to $110,804. Bearish sentiment persisted on Thursday as BTC fell below $110,000 and settled at $108,198. The price plunged to a low of $103,516 on Friday as selling pressure intensified. However, it recovered from this level to settle at $106,463, ultimately dropping 1.60%.

Amid this market, investors are seeking emerging opportunities highlighted in the latest crypto news, projects with strong fundamentals and early-stage growth potential. One cryptocurrency to buy now gaining significant attention is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , currently priced at $0.035 in Phase 6 of its presale, with over 70% sold out and more than $17.6 million raised. Its innovative dual-lending DeFi model, combining Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract liquidity pools, allows users to lend and borrow efficiently while maximizing capital use, giving Mutuum Finance both utility and upside potential. Analysts suggest that, with strong presale momentum and growing community backing, Mutuum Finance is positioning itself as a cryptocurrency to buy now with the potential to explode in value, offering investors an attractive alternative while ETH navigates resistance zones. Ethereum Price Prediction: Key Resistance Levels May Halt ETH’s Upward Rally To $5,000 Ethereum (ETH) currently trades at $4,147, and the key resistance at $4,222 lies in front of it as long-term investors keep selling, which may frustrate its rally to the $5,000 level. On-chain indicators tell of a Holder Accumulation Ratio of only 30%, far from the usual 50% level indicating firm investor belief, and subsequent spikes in “Age Consumed” that affirm continued distribution by long-term investors. If ETH can overcome $4,222 with strong buying pressure, it potentially has a target of $4,956–$5,000, while a failure to break this level could have the price correct lower to $3,872 or below. Amidst all this cautious market sentiment, investors are seeking to diversify into emerging opportunities with early-stage growth potential, with the spotlight fixed on Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is attracting increasing notice with expectations of the next market cycle. Presale Mania for Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is trending the market of crypto news with investors. Investor demand is piling up for its Phase 6 presale.

With additional investors going out and exploring high-potential crypto coins, Mutuum Finance is becoming increasingly the best altcoin to invest in October, especially for those seeking long-term value and real DeFi utility. This growing buzz has made it a frequent feature in crypto news, where analysts continue to point to MUTM as a strong cryptocurrency to buy now ahead of the next market breakout. The reality that a lot more than 70% of Phase 6 tokens have sold already is the token’s popularity and confidence of early adopters before the impending price boom. This quarter is also when the upcoming release of the Mutuum Finance lending and borrowing protocol will be the focus of the project’s roadmap updates. V1 release in Q4 2025 on Sepolia Testnet will introduce the future release of core DeFi infrastructure pieces, i.e., liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and liquidator bot.

This dramatic move came as officials in the Netherlands said they were worried about technology leaking to Wingtech, the Chinese firm that owns 100% of Nexperia. According to Reuters, Nexperia’s China unit went public on October 18 through a statement on its official WeChat account, saying it operates independently and strictly follows Chinese laws. The post added that workers at Nexperia China are only bound to take orders from within the China team. “All employees have the right to reject any external instructions that are not approved by the Chinese legal representative,” the company said. It also clarified that salaries and bonuses would continue to be paid by Nexperia China alone, not by the Dutch unit. China blocks chip exports as supply concerns grow Tensions escalated further on October 4, when China’s commerce ministry banned Nexperia from exporting chips out of the country. That instantly triggered concerns across the global auto and electronics sectors, where these low-end but essential chips are used in large volumes. While Nexperia’s biggest manufacturing plant sits in Hamburg, more than 70% of its chips are still shipped back to Dongguan in Guangdong province for packaging. The threat to chip supply spooked major European automakers . Both Volkswagen and BMW said they were actively checking their supply chains for any possible hit. So far, no production lines in Europe have been shut down. But things are getting tighter elsewhere. In Washington, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation warned that the standoff between the Netherlands and China could have global ripple effects. John Bozzella, who heads the group representing nearly every major carmaker in the United States, including General Motors, Toyota, Ford, Hyundai, and even Volkswagen, said the fallout could get real, fast. “If the shipment of automotive chips doesn’t resume – quickly – it’s going to disrupt auto production in the U.S. and many other countries and have a spillover effect in other industries,” John said on Thursday. Some U.S. automakers told Reuters that their factories might start feeling the pain as early as next month, though they kept quiet publicly due to how delicate the situation is. The worry is simple: Nexperia’s chips may not be fancy, but they’re crucial to making cars and parts in American plants. U.S. pressure triggered the Dutch government’s seizure The decision to take control of Nexperia didn’t happen overnight. It followed months of pressure from Washington. Documents show the Dutch government stepped in before new U.S. rules kicked in that would’ve expanded export controls to any company at least 50% owned by a blacklisted entity. Since Wingtech has full ownership of Nexperia, it was already staring down restrictions. Trump’s administration, which returned to power in 2025, had already listed Wingtech on the U.S. entity list in late December, part of its broader crackdown on Chinese tech access. The Dutch clearly didn’t want to wait for sanctions to hit. So they made the first move, hoping to block any tech handoffs and shield their semiconductor sector from being caught in the middle of a geopolitical brawl. On October 17, the Netherlands said it had opened talks with China to try to dial down the temperature. But the damage has already been done. Nexperia’s ability to move product is frozen. China is refusing outside interference. The U.S. is tightening the screws. And auto plants from Berlin to Detroit are sweating over chip deliveries that may or may not land.

It happened again in March 2023 when regional banks failed and the Fed had to create a new emergency facility just to keep collateral circulating. Each time, the diagnosis is familiar. A sudden shortage of liquidity, collateral or confidence. But those are surface symptoms. The real cause is structural: too few participants, too much concentration and too much dependence on a handful of balance sheets. We call these markets deep, but they are not distributed. They are highly centralized networks pretending to be decentralized ones. The repo market, the Treasury market and the FX market together make up the operating system of global finance, and that system now runs on a few machines. We have built a financial supercomputer with a single cooling fan. It works brilliantly until it does not. The architecture of concentration Start with the repo market. On paper it is vast, roughly 12 trillion dollars in daily outstanding volume. In practice, it is dominated by four or five dealers. Those same firms intermediate most bilateral trades, supply tri-party liquidity and sit between nearly every large buyer and seller of Treasury collateral. When one dealer hesitates, the whole chain stalls. In the bond market, the story is the same. A handful of primary dealers stand between the Treasury and the rest of the world. Market making in Treasuries, once distributed among dozens of firms, is now concentrated in less than ten. The buy side is not any more diverse. Five asset managers control over a quarter of global fixed income assets. The trading venues themselves, from Tradeweb to MarketAxess, have network effects that reinforce the same pattern: a small number of nodes carrying a massive volume of flow. FX looks global, but it follows the same topology. The Bank for International Settlements estimates that the majority of daily FX turnover, roughly 7.5 trillion dollars, passes through fewer than a dozen global dealers. The interdealer market is dense, but the customer market depends almost entirely on those same banks for liquidity. Nonbank liquidity providers have grown, but they connect through the same pipes. In each case, liquidity appears to be a property of the market. In reality, it is a property of dealer balance sheets. When those balance sheets are constrained by regulation, by risk appetite or by fear, liquidity evaporates. We did not build markets as networks. We built them as star systems, a few massive suns with everyone else orbiting their gravity. Centralization as a feature, then a bug This structure was not an accident. It was efficient when computation, trust and capital were expensive. Concentration simplified coordination. A small number of intermediaries made it easier for the Fed to transmit policy, for the Treasury to issue debt and for global investors to access dollar liquidity. For decades, that efficiency looked like stability. But over time, every stress episode revealed the same fragility. The 2019 repo spike happened because balance sheet capacity was maxed out. The 2020 Treasury selloff happened because the biggest dealers could not warehouse risk. Each time, the Fed stepped in, expanding its role, building new facilities and absorbing more of the market’s load. That is not policy drift. It is physics. The logic of centralization compounds itself. When liquidity dries up, everyone runs to the only balance sheet big enough to backstop the system. Each rescue reinforces the dependency. We are now in a regime where the central bank is not just a lender of last resort. It is a dealer of first resort. The Treasury and the Fed together are the two sides of the same balance sheet, one issuing collateral, the other providing leverage against it. The modern financial system has become a state backed utility, not a distributed market. Balance sheet capitalism This is the real definition of our era: balance sheet capitalism. In balance sheet capitalism, markets do not clear through price discovery. They clear through balance sheet capacity. Liquidity is not the flow of buyers and sellers. It is the willingness of a few intermediaries to expand their books. The plumbing of the global dollar system, repo, Treasuries and FX now depends on the same limited nodes. The paradox is that every regulation meant to reduce systemic risk has made this concentration worse. Capital rules, liquidity ratios and clearing mandates all push intermediation into fewer, larger hands. The system is safer in isolation but more correlated in aggregate. When every dollar of liquidity depends on the same two balance sheets, the Fed’s and JPMorgan’s, you no longer have a market. You have a queue. We have financialized trust into a single counterparty. In this world, systemic risk does not come from leverage alone. It comes from architecture. A network that looks decentralized on paper but behaves as a single organism in practice. The more the system grows, the more its stability depends on the political and operational capacity of those core institutions. That is not capitalism. That is infrastructure. Liquidity as code The next evolution of markets will not come from regulation. It will come from computation. When you move markets onchain, you refactor the system. You replace balance sheets with state machines. Onchain markets change three fundamental properties of liquidity: Transparency . Collateral, leverage and exposure are visible in real time. Risk is not a quarterly report. It is a live feed. Programmable trust . Margin, clearing and settlement rules are executed by code, not negotiated by dealers. Counterparty risk becomes deterministic. Permissionless participation . Anyone with capital can provide or consume liquidity. Market access becomes a function of software, not relationships. These properties turn liquidity into something structural, not conditional. It is no longer a function of who is willing to take your trade. It is a property of the network itself. On chain repo markets already exist in prototype form. Tokenized Treasury collateral, automated lending pools and stablecoins acting as cash equivalents. The same mechanics that govern traditional repo, collateral, margin and rollover can be encoded directly into smart contracts. FX swaps, yield curves and derivatives can follow the same logic. The difference is not ideology. It is physics. It is cheaper, faster and safer to compute trust than to regulate it. Onchain markets are what finance looks like when liquidity stops being a privilege and becomes a protocol. The parallel dollar system The first real version of this world is already here. Stablecoins are the onchain descendants of repo collateral, dollar denominated liabilities backed by short term assets. Tokenized Treasuries are the first transparent collateral instruments in financial history. And onchain money markets, from protocol-based lending pools to tokenized reverse repo facilities, are beginning to act as the new funding layer for global capital. Together, these components form a parallel dollar system, one that still references the U.S. Treasury and the Fed but operates with radically different mechanics. In the traditional system, information is private, leverage is opaque and liquidity is reactive. In the onchain system, information is public, leverage is observable and liquidity is programmatic. When stress hits, this transparency changes the entire dynamic. Markets do not have to guess who is solvent. They can see it. Collateral does not disappear into balance sheet black boxes. It can move instantly to where it is needed. The global dollar system is moving, piece by piece, to a public ledger. Tokenized T-bills now exceed two billion dollars in circulation and are growing faster than most traditional money funds. Onchain stablecoin settlement volumes already rival major card networks. And as institutional adoption accelerates, these numbers will compound. This is not a fringe system anymore. It is a mirror system; smaller, faster and more transparent than the one it is quietly replacing. Over time, the line between onchain and offchain will blur. The deepest collateral, the most efficient funding and the most liquid FX will migrate to where transparency and composability are highest. Not because of ideology, but because that is where capital efficiency is greatest. The architecture of trust The dollar system is not going away. It is upgrading. The financial system we built in the twentieth century was centralized because computation was expensive. You needed trust hierarchies, banks, dealers and clearinghouses to coordinate risk and liquidity. The twenty first century system does not need those hierarchies in the same way. Verification is now cheap. Transparency is computational. Coordination can be automated. Central banks will still exist. Treasury markets will still matter. But the architecture will be different. The Fed will not need to be the single cooling fan of the financial supercomputer. It will be one of many nodes in a network that can self-balance. Onchain markets do not eliminate risk. They distribute it. They make it visible, auditable and composable. They turn liquidity into code, trust into infrastructure and systemic risk into a design variable rather than a surprise. For decades, we have been adding complexity to hide fragility, new facilities, new intermediaries and new regulations. The next step is to remove opacity to reveal resilience. What began as a speculative experiment in crypto is evolving into the next monetary infrastructure, an open, programmable foundation for global finance. The transition will not be instant. It will happen gradually, then suddenly, the way all systemic upgrades do. One day, most of the world’s collateral will settle on open ledgers, and nobody will call it crypto anymore. It will just be the market. When that happens, liquidity will stop depending on who owns the biggest balance sheet. It will depend on who runs the best code. And that is how finance will finally evolve from a hierarchy into a network.

According to Bloomberg, the fund is designed to provide traditional investors more access to the crypto market amid a spectacular recovery from the FTX-inspired market crash in November 2022. Related Reading: Ethereum Institutional Accumulation Frenzy: Bitmine Expands Holdings With Another Massive Strategic ETH Buy Hayes PE Fund Targets 6 Company Acquisitions In a post on Friday, Bloomberg reports that Maelstrom, founded by Arthur Hayes and former BitMEX M&A Head Akshat Vaidya, is actively working to raise $250 million for investment in mid-sized crypto firms. The fund, tagged as Maelstrom Equity Fund I, is expected to cover the acquisition of six crypto companies, with each purchase expected to range between $40 million-$75 million. Notably, there will be a strategic focus on blockchain service providers, including trading infrastructure and analytics startups. In a recent X post , Vaidaya, who acts as the managing director, provides more insights into this fund, highlighting the problem and proposed solution. Vaidaya describes the new initiative as the first control-buyout PE fund to focus solely on the crypto ecosystem. The Maelstrom Equity Fund I is to achieve profitability in three main ways. First of which is providing founders of supporting blockchain services to access clean exit opportunities at reasonable valuations. Furthermore, the PE fund would also aim to help new TradFi entrants to the crypto space navigate investment in businesses by providing them access to “an acquisition-ready portfolio of cash-flowing, growing businesses for future buyers of crypto businesses like Robinhood, Charles Schwab, X, Wealthfront, etc.” Finally, Hayes, Vaidaya and newly hired partner Adam Schlegel are also looking to offer capital allocators such as pension funds or other family offices the opportunity to invest capital at scale, e.g, 9 figures+, into the “most fundamentally valuable” sectors of the crypto economy, i.e., the blockchain supporting business, without having to worry about token exposure or market volatility. Maelstrom PE Fund: High Risk Or Not? Interestingly, Bloomberg notes that Maelstrom’s proposed equity fund comes amidst a challenging period as PE firms are globally struggling to attract capital. In the crypto market, PE investment is reportedly down to $1.4 billion, representing a 65% decline from the peak of 2021, which suggests a significant business risk for Hayes and partners. However, a series of high-profile acquisitions amidst a rebounding market since the FTX crash, coupled with the mechanics of the Maelstrom, provides an appealing context for investors. At press time, the total crypto market cap is valued at $3.59 trillion following a 1.06% decline in the last 24 hours.",Crypto News|Adam Schegel|Akshat Vaidya|Arthur Hayes|Bloomberg|maelstrom|private equity,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-18 22:30:03

Analyst Reveals Worst-Case Scenario,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/xrp-price-to-crash-40-analyst-reveals-worst-case-scenario/,"XRP has found itself back under the microscope as bullish momentum is yet to return with full force. Another weekend is here, and XRP’s price action is still perambulating around last weekend’s flash crash, which saw the cryptocurrency register its biggest liquidation candlestick in history. Now, XRP is trying to recover to higher price levels above $2. Interestingly, one technical analysis warns that, before any major rebound, the price of XRP could suffer a severe decline, possibly down as much as 40%. While such a drop would be painful for holders, the scenario is being cast not as a permanent collapse but as a capitulation move that might precede a stronger rally. Related Reading: Biggest Shiba Inu Burn In Months — And It Came From A Coinbase Account Worst Case Scenario What transpired last weekend in the crypto markets qualifies as the largest deleveraging event in recent memory. Leveraged positions were forcibly closed out across many exchanges, leading to cascading liquidations that sent price action into a free fall. As such, about $19 billion in positions was wiped out in the span of hours. In XRP’s case, that intense pressure led to a violent plunge that created a deep low wick to break below $1.6 on its price chart before a quick rebound above $2.2. That wick is central to the argument that the forced selling squeezed both longs and shorts, clearing excess leverage and setting the stage for price discovery to reset. However, a suggestion is that the worst may not yet be fully priced in, and that this purge might continue deeper before sentiment truly turns bullish. This worst-case scenario outlook is based on an analysis by Steph Is Crypto that envisions another possible 40% crash in the XRP price. As shown in the price chart below, XRP’s price action might fall to revisit last weekend flash crash bottom just above $1.55. This price level may represent the deepest downside target before the market catches its footing again. If current levels give way, say if XRP loses its more immediate support zones at $2.2 and $2, the descent toward that boundary would amount to a drop of about 30 to 40%. XRP Price Chart Analysis. Source: Steph Is Crypto on X What’s Next After The Crash? The wick already formed by the sudden flash crash is interpreted as an initial flush of stops, but the full erosion of weak hands might still have room to run. Only after that purge can a more sustainable rebound be believable.

From here, the analyst projected an extended rally that will see the XRP price break into new all-time highs above $3.8. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.35, up by 4% in the past 24 hours.

Ethereum and XRP were among the worst hit, bringing the total crypto market cap down 6% in 24 hours to $3.76 trillion. As momentum fades in larger-cap assets, analysts are shifting focus to smaller, audited projects with quantifiable fundamentals. Among these candidates, MAGACOIN FINANCE has stood out, drawing attention from investors looking for growth opportunities below the $0.01 mark. Ethereum Faces Continued Pressure Ethereum dipped to $3,700 after four consecutive daily losses. The correction has followed heavy selling in derivatives and spot markets. ETF outflows averaged $57 million on Thursday; only BlackRock’s ETHA had inflows of $47 million. Graysale’s ETHE recorded $69 million withdrawals, a reflection of reduced confidence in institutional participation. Source: SoSoValue Technical indicators also favor a bearish trend. The daily indicator chart shows some sell signals, including a downward-sloping MACD and weakening momentum around short-term support areas. If the sell continues, Ethereum could touch its 200-day EMA close to $3,550 with its continuation near the October low of $3,430. Analysts noted that a fresh recovery will need new inflows and stronger on-chain activity to restore buyer confidence. XRP Buyers Lose Confidence Ripple’s XRP is trading below its major support level at $2.22, indicating higher selling pressure. Open Interest (OI) has dipped to an average of $3.81 billion, down from a high in July of $10.94 billion. This decline signifies a diminishing pool of speculative buyers and limited conviction among traders. Source: CoinMarketCap Technical momentum is still weak. The MACD is flashing sell signals again, RSI is in oversold territory, but no clear divergence. Bulls have been unable to recover lost ground, indicating that market participants await new catalysts. Analysts caution that whales are relatively inactive, which means that XRP will face further downside if overall sentiment doesn’t improve. Analysts Turn to MAGACOIN FINANCE As Ethereum and XRP dip, traders are moving to MAGACOIN FINANCE for 75x returns from sub-$0.01 levels. The shift is driven by the growing demand for low-cap projects that offer transparency, certified audits, and sustainable token design. Analysts believe MAGACOIN FINANCE has the fundamentals investors are looking for when major altcoins lose momentum. The Hashex audit reinforced confidence in the project’s smart contract with zero critical or medium-risk findings. Token minting, liquidity, and distribution functions work as they have been designed to. No hidden administrative control is present, so the token supply cannot be manipulated, providing reassurance to long-term holders. Additionally, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s scarcity model adds to the optimism. As the total number of tokens in circulation slowly erodes, organic demand pressure builds. With an infrastructure of verified audits, transparent liquidity tracking, and a growing investor base, these fundamentals offer a realistic path for the 75x compounding gains once broader market sentiment improves. Broader Market View Market analysts observe that capital rotation often follows phases of weakness in leading assets. When Ethereum and XRP lose steam, investors tend to explore smaller, verified ecosystems capable of delivering asymmetric returns. Projects that emphasize accountability and clear token structures are now attracting the majority of early interest. This rotation marks a shift in investor priorities from hype to proof-based participation. Transparency, liquidity control, and community engagement are becoming essential filters for new capital inflows. MAGACOIN FINANCE aligns with these evolving standards, making it a key name in current analyst discussions about potential recovery plays. Conclusion Ethereum and XRP’s latest correction is reshaping investor focus across the market. While large-caps consolidate, interest is gravitating toward smaller, well-audited tokens that demonstrate clear fundamentals and transparent tokenomics. MAGACOIN FINANCE has positioned itself in that space, bridging investor caution with credible long-term potential. Analysts agree that the next bull cycle will reward projects built on transparency and verified data. If MAGACOIN FINANCE maintains its structured ecosystem and community momentum, it could become one of the defining early-stage success stories of the upcoming market rebound.

Here’s What Really Happened",https://timestabloid.com/sell-order-analyst-lists-one-xrp-for-1000-heres-what-really-happened/,"An XRP enthusiast and market analyst, Diep Sanh, has stirred discussion within the XRP community after publicly placing a sell order to exchange 1 XRP for $1,000. Despite the current market downturn, Sanh maintains that at some point in the future, someone will meet that valuation. At the time of his statement, XRP was still trading near $3, making his optimistic price target a symbolic reflection of his long-term belief in the asset. However, since early October, XRP has faced notable price weakness. The token, which was valued at $3.10 on October 2, now trades around $2.35 , representing a 25% decline in just two weeks and marking its lowest point in four months. Sanh’s $1,000 XRP Sell Order Sanh shared a screenshot of his sell order showing his intent to sell 1 XRP for 1,000 USDC. According to him, the order represents his conviction that XRP’s value could one day reach the $1,000 mark , a milestone many analysts consider unrealistic. “One day, someone will pay $1,000 for 1 XRP,” he stated confidently, suggesting that the digital asset’s potential has not yet been fully realized. Placing a sell order. One day, someone will pay $1,000 for 1 XRP pic.twitter.com/Jmd6maXB7e — BD (@DiepSanh) October 6, 2025 His post quickly generated attention within the community, drawing mixed reactions. Supporters praised his confidence, while skeptics questioned the practicality of such a price level given XRP’s current market dynamics. Among those who responded was Wietse Wind, a key developer in the XRP ecosystem and founder of Xaman. Wind pointed out that for a $1,000 order to be filled, the XRP Ledger’s automated market maker (AMM) and order book would first need to clear all existing orders between the current price and that value. How the XRP Ledger Processes Orders Wind explained that the XRP Ledger (XRPL) operates differently from centralized exchanges like Binance. Instead of directly matching buy and sell orders at fixed prices, the XRPL prioritizes orders based on the most competitive available offers. This means that any order at $1,000 would remain inactive until every lower-priced sell order, such as those at $3, $10, or $100, had been fulfilled. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Given this mechanism, Wind concluded that a single XRP token can’t be purchased at $1,000 under current market conditions, emphasizing that the order book would need to clear sequentially before such a trade could occur. Broader Context Around the $1,000 Price Target Despite criticism, Sanh has repeatedly expressed confidence that XRP could one day reach the $1,000 threshold, though he acknowledges this might take years. In past discussions, he referenced 2030 as a possible timeframe for such a scenario, though no technical or fundamental evidence supports this projection. Interestingly, other XRP advocates have echoed similar long-term predictions. Following Ripple’s recent acquisition of GTreasury, aimed at enhancing its liquidity management capabilities, community analyst XFinanceBull suggested that the move could strengthen XRP’s long-term value outlook and, in theory, pave the way toward significantly higher price levels. For context, an XRP price of $1,000 would imply a 43,000% increase from its current market value of about $2.35, resulting in a market capitalization of tens of trillions of dollars, figures that far exceed the total size of the global cryptocurrency market. Sanh’s post reflects a recurring theme in crypto communities: the belief that breakthroughs could redefine asset valuations in the long run.

The decline followed a selloff that wiped billions off the top digital assets. Historically, fear levels like these have led to major bounces as institutional players step in while retail traders panic. Market data indicates renewed accumulation of wallets across major exchanges, indicating a quiet confidence among long-term holders. Despite this caution, analysts have pointed to five best cryptos to buy that are displaying resilience and strong upside potential: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, and MAGACOIN FINANCE. These coins are still on the watch list of funds that are preparing for the next recovery phase. Each asset features strong fundamentals with an active community and consistent network activity. MAGACOIN FINANCE , specifically, stands out as one of the rapidly emerging altcoins that analysts predict will have impressive ROI and outperform due to its low entry point and strong market potential. 1. Bitcoin (BTC) — Institutional Confidence Builds Bitcoin is still the foundation of institutional crypto portfolios. Despite recent volatility, data indicate that large holders are accumulating near the $105,000 level. Institutions seem to be gearing up for the next market rebound with fear cycles as entry points. Analysts point out that Bitcoin’s liquidity and scarcity still provide long-term conviction. Historically, whenever the Fear Index was between 25 and 30, Bitcoin would rally back within weeks. Recent sentiment indicates that such a scenario could soon play out. With a dominance of over 52%, Bitcoin remains the primary trend setter for the market. 2. Ethereum (ETH) — Strength Behind Layer-1 Activity Ethereum’s pullback hasn’t affected its network health. Staking volumes are stable, and decentralized application activity continues to grow. Ethereum ETF inflows are expected to increase institutional exposure, providing renewed stability after recent declines. Additionally, developers continue to release updates and scaling solutions, further solidifying long-term belief in the asset. Its liquidity, smart-contract dominance, and steady user base make it an institution favorite as they look to get back in the game amid uncertainty. 3. Solana (SOL) — Oversold Levels Attract Buyers Solana’s recent dip has caught the attention of value-minded investors. Now, its RSI is showing oversold conditions, which is often the precursor to short-term recoveries. On-chain data reveals that large wallets are accumulating around the $180 level, suggesting a belief in Solana’s ecosystem strength. Analysts note that Solana’s developer community continues to be one of the fastest-growing in the industry. If the market sentiment stabilizes, Solana may retest the resistance at $220, bolstered by increasing institutional and retail participation. 4. Avalanche (AVAX) — Growing Enterprise Adoption Avalanche keeps expanding partnerships across traditional Finance and blockchain businesses. Its subnet technology ensures that institutions can use tokenized assets safely and effectively. Analysts believe this is a huge advantage as real-life asset tokenization is taking off. Avalanche’s low transaction fees and fast confirmation times continue to make it a top Layer-1 competitor. Its corporate traction puts it in a stronger position in the next rebound cycle. AVAX stands to gain from continual institutional adoption as international companies consider blockchain adoption worldwide. 5. MAGACOIN FINANCE — Analysts Project 200x Potential As the Fear and Greed Index hits 28, analysts have turned their attention to MAGACOIN FINANCE, a project gaining momentum despite the market downturn. Its token model, built around scarcity and transparent distribution, has helped it attract a loyal base of holders while many assets faced heavy selling. Whale-tracking platforms reveal steady accumulation since the pullback, a trend often seen in projects gaining traction before major recoveries. The limited token supply and transparent ecosystem have strengthened investor trust at a time when fear dominates the broader market. Analysts interpret this accumulation pattern as an early indicator of confidence returning to select altcoins. Institutional interest has also started to surface, with several analysts listing MAGACOIN FINANCE among high-upside watchlist projects. With a 200x projection , analysts believe its low entry point, growing base, and strong fundamentals could position it as one of the best crypto to buy before the next rebound cycle. Final Outlook Periods of fear often precede accumulation by disciplined investors. Data from previous cycles confirms that markets tend to recover quickly once institutional inflows stabilize. Analysts say sentiment indicators like the Fear and Greed Index often act as contrarian signals, rewarding those who buy when others hesitate. With institutional money quietly returning, the market appears to be setting up for another recovery wave. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, and MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out as one of the best cryptos to buy before the rebound strengthens. Each combines strong fundamentals with clear catalysts that could drive performance once fear gives way to renewed optimism.

53346733,https://timestabloid.com/?p=86856,1760832046,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP Supply Shock: How Token Burns Could Impact Price by 2035,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-supply-shock-how-token-burns-could-impact-price-by-2035/,"As XRP continues to trade below $2.30, conversations around its long-term token supply and potential scarcity have resurfaced. The XRP Ledger (XRPL), designed with a maximum supply of 100 billion tokens, consistently reduces its total through token burns attached to transaction fees. Presently, approximately 5,000 XRP are destroyed daily in this process. Although this figure appears minimal, several analysts argue that the cumulative effect of these burns, especially if daily network activity expands, could significantly reduce the available supply by 2035. Supply Projections and Possible Valuations At present, XRP’s circulating supply stands near 59.9 billion tokens, with a market capitalization of around $150 billion at a unit price of $2.35 . Analysts estimate that if the total supply declines by 40% within the next decade, the overall number of XRP tokens could fall to approximately 60 billion, while circulation might settle around 40 billion. This estimate factors in Ripple’s escrow holdings and assumes continuous burning alongside potential company participation in reducing outstanding tokens. If market demand remains stable under these conditions, the price could reach roughly $4.17 per token, a 77% increase from current levels. This calculation is based purely on scarcity-driven appreciation rather than expanded utility. However, supply contraction alone does not determine market value. XRP’s price trajectory will largely depend on its demand, which is influenced by real-world adoption and utility. Key factors include RippleNet’s payment volume, cross-border settlement usage, and broader integration of XRP Ledger services by institutions. If these adoption metrics grow, the combined effects of increased demand and declining supply could accelerate price growth. For example, a 50% rise in demand paired with a 40% supply reduction could push prices toward $6.25. Should demand double during the same period, XRP could trade above $8. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Moreover, if transaction volume expands significantly, resulting in 15,000 to 20,000 XRP burned daily, supply reduction could become more pronounced. By 2035, this scenario could remove over 100 million XRP from circulation, potentially lifting prices into the $12–$16 range , assuming steady demand levels. Assessing the Likelihood Despite these optimistic forecasts, achieving a 40% reduction in total supply may prove difficult. The current burn rate of 5,000 tokens per day equates to approximately 1.8 million XRP annually, just 20 million over the next decade. Such figures represent a small fraction of the total token pool. To create a significant impact, network activity and transaction volume would need to increase substantially. Even so, XRP’s capped supply structure and gradual deflationary design continue to support the argument for long-term value appreciation. Incremental rises in daily burns, combined with adoption growth, could still meaningfully reinforce its scarcity narrative. Broader Market Expectations While some analysts focus on deflationary projections, others envision far higher valuations based on long-term utility and institutional involvement. Cameron Scrubs, founder of Tradeship University, has suggested that XRP could overtake Bitcoin by 2030 and become the top cryptocurrency. Similarly, Coach JV has voiced confidence in XRP reaching the $300 mark in the future. Independent projections from Changelly also reflect a bullish stance, forecasting that XRP might climb to around $115 by December 2034. Although the possibility of a 40% supply cut by 2035 remains uncertain, the principle of scarcity supports XRP’s potential for gradual price appreciation. If network activity increases and adoption strengthens, XRP could benefit from both supply contraction and rising demand, setting the stage for higher valuations over the next decade.

Bitcoin Trendline Breach Sparks Talk Of Corrective Wave In Play,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-corrective-wave-in-play-2/,"Bitcoin’s weekly chart is at a pivotal point, with price action hovering around key structural levels. Traders are now questioning whether the current move marks the start of a deeper correction or just a healthy consolidation before the next leg up. Elliott Wave Signals Align With Developing Correction Elliott Waves Academy, in its latest analysis tracking Bitcoin’s expected wave path on the weekly timeframe, has raised a key question: has the corrective wave begun? The recent market structure indicates that the bullish leg has likely completed, and the price may now be transitioning into a corrective phase. A critical support level of the prior upward wave has been broken, hinting at a potential wave reversal in progress. Related Reading: Bitcoin On-Chain Activity Slumps Below 365-Day Average – Is Momentum Losing Steam? The evidence for this transition grows stronger when observing the break below the lower boundary of the diagonal pattern and the final price channel. Both of these structures previously acted as strong supports during Bitcoin’s impulsive climb, and their breakdown now suggests that market control is slowly shifting from buyers to sellers. Currently, Bitcoin is trading beneath the lower boundary of the price channel, which has flipped into a key resistance zone. As long as the price remains below this zone, bearish sentiment could persist, keeping the market in a cautious state. Despite the weakness, there are signs that the downward sub-wave might be nearing completion. The structure suggests that a short-term upward corrective wave could emerge as the market attempts to stabilize and regain footing. Expected Outlooks Sharing his expectations, Elliott Waves Academy noted that Bitcoin may continue to consolidate around its current levels as bulls attempt to defend their positions. Such a phase of sideways movement often reflects a period of indecision in the market, where both buyers and sellers are waiting for confirmation before committing to their next major moves. Related Reading: Bitcoin Structure Points To Healthy Correction Before Next Wave Toward $150,000 However, the Academy cautioned that if signs of weakness begin to emerge near the current resistance zone, the market could face a potential reversal. This shift could trigger renewed bearish pressure, pushing Bitcoin into a deeper corrective leg. According to the analysis, the correction could extend toward the 50%–61.8% Fibonacci retracement levels of the previous upward wave. These Fibonacci zones often serve as key areas of support during corrective movements, and a decline into these ranges could provide a more stable foundation for a future bullish reversal. Ultimately, monitoring price behavior around these crucial levels in the following days will be essential. Whether the market holds firm in consolidation or slips into a deeper retracement, the upcoming movements in these zones could set the tone for the next phase of Bitcoin’s long-term wave cycle.

The move underscores a widening divergence between traditional and digital stores of value, raising questions about BTC’s role as digital gold in a macro environment that should favor both. Momentum Gap: Bitcoin Stagnation And Gold Surge In a compelling and sobering perspective, the current state of the crypto market, particularly Bitcoin, is contrasting sharply with the performance of gold. As analyst Exy pointed out on X, Gold is breaking all-time highs week by week, and yet BTC hasn’t moved an inch. EXY also revealed that social risk is at zero, and Google Trends remains stagnant for BTC searches. Exy describes the current crypto environment as an internal struggle, where participants are pvping, liquidating, scamming, pumping, and dumping against each other. However, the market tops are in euphoria and not in a stagnant period, as observed in the ongoing movement of Gold. Interestingly, when gold starts to consolidate, other risk assets such as BTC could finally catch their bounce . Furthermore, the social risk will start improving once we see a consistent rate cut by the Federal Reserve (FED), which allows the normies to have extra cash monthly, and also quantitative easing (QE) to pump our assets . “Regardless, this isn’t over yet,” Exy noted. Gold $30 Trillion Dominance Puts BTC Potential Into Perspective CryptoRank.io has revealed that gold’s absolute inflow has exceeded Bitcoin’s by more than $15 trillion since January 1, 2024, underscoring the metal’s continued dominance as a global store of value. The Gold total market capitalization has surged to $29.6 trillion since the start of 2024, while BTC has climbed to $2.15 trillion . Despite BTC’s growing adoption and its integration into digital assets in institutional finance, investors continue to view gold as the primary safe-haven asset amid economic market uncertainty. At the same time, the gold narrative is evolving, with tokenized commodities such as Tether Gold (XAUT), PAX Gold (PAXG), and AurusGOLD (AWG) experiencing rapid growth, offering investors on-chain exposure to physical gold and other precious metals. Crypto expert theunipcs has also mentioned that the global gold market has now reached a staggering $30 trillion, adding over $12 trillion in value in the past year alone in its market cap. According to today’s metrics, if BTC captured just 10% of gold’s current market cap, it would trade around $150,700 per BTC, and that’s the bare minimum it would reach before this cycle tops out.",Bitcoin News|AurusGOLD|AWG|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|CryptoRank.io|gold|PAX Gold (PAXG)|Tether Gold (XAUT)|theunipc,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|FIAT|BTC|MACROECONOMICS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-19 00:00:59

As traders analyze what’s the best crypto to buy now, many are looking beyond legacy platforms to emerging projects with high growth potential. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one such project, currently priced at $0.035 in Phase 6 of its presale, with over 70% already sold out and $17.6 million raised, quickly gaining traction among retail investors. Its innovative dual-lending DeFi model, combining Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract liquidity pools, provides practical utility while offering potential for substantial returns, making it a top choice for crypto investment in 2025. For those seeking both established chains and promising new entrants, ADA’s updates and MUTM’s presale momentum together highlight the growing landscape of high-potential cryptocurrencies. Cardano (ADA) Price Prediction: Bullish Flag Indicates 138% Potential Upside Cardano (ADA) is ranging in a bullish flag chart pattern on the daily chart on October 15, 2025, following the establishment of a downward parallel channel after a spectacular July rally. With the price bouncing off the lower boundary at $0.6888 and resisting around $0.80–$0.85, which is also at the 50-day EMA value of $0.8051, investors eagerly await a breakout that will validate the resumption of the momentum of the previous pole. If ADA closes above the upper boundary of the flag and continues the same, the measured move estimates approximately a 138% rise, indicating $1.64, which is equal to the indicated resistance of $1.6324. While Cardano is observed by investors, so is Mutuum Finance, catching the eye of those who would like to discover the next big-growing crypto to add to the league of well-established market giants. Investor Mania Drives Mutuum Finance Presale Frenzy Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has emerged as a leading crypto project to make an investment in the DeFi space and a crowd favorite for those who wish to know the best crypto to buy now.

The project has already reached its 6th stage of presale, and the token has so far reached $0.035 after it increased by 16.17% from stage 5. Growing optimism among buyers has seen over 17,300 investors investing more than $17.6 million to date in the presale. Phase 6 is already 70% sold out, but interest still holds with the clock ticking for investors to get onboard before the end of this phase. This steady traction has further solidified Mutuum Finance’s position as a new cryptocurrency to watch and one of the best crypto investment opportunities developing legitimate utility in DeFi. Mutuum Finance Lending & Borrowing Protocol to Go Live in Q4 2025 The project will go live with its much-anticipated lending and borrowing protocol , which will be a milestone in its DeFi journey.

Market analysts are turning cautiously bullish, expecting a potential 40% relief rally before the end of the year as liquidity builds and whale wallets continue to buy the dip. At the same time, early investors are looking beyond Bitcoin toward emerging altcoins showing resilience in the current consolidation. Among them, MAGACOIN FINANCE has gained early traction among smart money circles — viewed as a hidden accumulation play positioned to outperform once capital rotates back into smaller, undervalued assets. Bitcoin Finds Stability at Key Support After weeks of volatility, Bitcoin has held the $104K–$106K range with strong buying activity from institutional and long-term holders. On-chain data from Glassnode shows rising exchange outflows, indicating that investors are moving BTC into cold storage — a sign of confidence in near-term recovery potential. If BTC maintains its current range through the end of the week, analysts expect momentum to build toward the $120K–$125K zone , mirroring similar relief rallies that occurred during the 2021 and 2023 cycles. Whales Accumulate as Fear Eases The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , which had dropped to 28 earlier this month, has now rebounded to 34 — signaling a gradual shift in market sentiment. This aligns with on-chain inflows showing that whale wallets (1,000+ BTC) have accumulated over $650 million in the last five days. Such accumulation phases often mark the turning points of mid-cycle corrections, with analysts noting that “the quiet accumulation phase” tends to precede sharp upside breakouts. Altcoins Could Follow Bitcoin’s Rebound If Bitcoin confirms its 40% relief rally, analysts expect leading altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) , Solana (SOL) , and Cardano (ADA) to mirror the move. These assets have entered oversold zones with attractive risk-reward ratios for Q4 positioning. Projects like HYPE , AVAX , and SUI are also being highlighted as potential outperformers once liquidity returns — particularly as investors begin to rotate away from Bitcoin into higher-growth opportunities. MAGACOIN FINANCE Attracts Early Accumulators During periods of consolidation, smart investors often look for undervalued small-cap plays with high upside potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as one of the few projects sustaining steady momentum through this correction. The project’s audited framework, active presale performance, and growing social engagement have positioned it as a market-cycle accumulation favorite among retail and whale investors alike. Analysts suggest that if Bitcoin’s rebound triggers another round of altcoin inflows, MAGACOIN FINANCE could become one of the biggest beneficiaries heading into early 2025. Analysts Predict Relief Rally Before Year-End Most experts agree that the coming weeks will determine whether Bitcoin’s $105K support holds as the macro floor for the next upward leg. If it does, a sharp 40% rally toward $145K could unfold, reigniting broader market enthusiasm. As confidence returns, traders are positioning early across key sectors — with Bitcoin, Solana, and MAGACOIN FINANCE among the assets most likely to lead the year-end rebound.

With over $536 million in Spot Bitcoin ETF outflows in a single day, the downturn has sparked renewed fears of an extended bearish phase. Analysts are calling this correction a “Bloody Friday,” a less but still severe reflection of last week’s brutal selloff that wiped billions in the market and saw BTC and ETH spiraling downwards. Related Reading: Biggest Shiba Inu Burn In Months — And It Came From A Coinbase Account ETF Outflows Trigger Bitcoin And Ethereum Price Crash The recent crash in Bitcoin and Ethereum prices is being attributed to recent large-scale outflows from US Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Crypto analyst Jana on X social media described the event as one of the bloodiest weekly downturns of the quarter, with Bitcoin tumbling 13.3% in seven days and Ethereum sliding 17.8% over the past month. At press time, Bitcoin is trading slightly above $106,940 while Ethereum sits around $3,870, both suffering steep retracements from their recent highs. Data from SoSoValue shows that Thursday, October 16, saw a staggering $536.4 million in daily net outflows from Spot Bitcoin ETFs, marking the largest single-day negative flow since August 1, when $812 million exited the market. Out of twelve US Bitcoin ETFs, eight registered major outflows, led by $275.15 million leaving Ark & 21Shares’ ARKB, followed by $132 million from Fidelity’s FBTC. Notably, funds managed by other major companies like Grayscale, BlackRock, Bitwise, VanEck, and Valkyrie also reported significant withdrawals. These persistent outflows have now stretched into their third consecutive day, with October 17, just a day ago, recording a massive outflow of $366.5 million. The sustained negative ETF flows underscore waning investor confidence and suggest that the broader market downturn could continue in the near term. Combined with the $19 billion liquidation event last Friday, increased outflows in ETFs could put more selling pressure on the already fragile market. Experts Warn Of Deeper Market Pain Ahead Many experts believe that the crypto market may still have more room for a decline. Data from Polymarket, one of the world’s largest prediction platforms, show that 52% of participants expect Bitcoin to drop below $100,000 before the end of October. Veteran economist and Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff has also warned that the coming months could be catastrophic for the industry, predicting widespread bankruptcies, defaults, and layoffs as Bitcoin and Ethereum face another major leg down. Meanwhile, technical analysts are pointing to signs of deeper weakness in Ethereum’s structure. According to Crypto Damus, Ethereum has broken key weekly support and is displaying a bearish setup on the charts. He says that MACD is about to “cross red,” leaving a significant amount of room for a crash. Other analysts like Marzell have echoed similar concerns, stating that Ethereum is now nearing a “crash zone.” However, he also highlighted the $3,690 – $3,750 range as a possible short-term demand area where buyers could step in again and trigger the next leg up.

53349746,609198,1760837425,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53349746.jpeg,Rumors Circulate That Ripple Is Buying $1 Billion Worth Of XRP — Here’s What We Know,https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-buying-1-billion-of-xrp/,"Crypto firm Ripple is reportedly set to raise up to $1 billion to set up an XRP treasury firm. The firm is notably the largest XRP holder and plans to contribute some of its holdings to this proposed venture. Ripple To Raise $1 Billion For XRP Treasury According to a Bloomberg report , Ripple is leading an effort to raise at least $1 billion to buy XRP. These coins will be held by a new digital-asset treasury firm , which will hold XRP as its primary reserve asset. Meanwhile, the crypto firm plans to raise this sum through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). The proposed XRP treasury firm by Ripple could become the largest in the U.S. if it raises up to $1 billion to buy XRP. Meanwhile, Bloomberg reported that Ripple also plans to contribute some of its own XRP to facilitate this move. The crypto firm is the largest XRP holder , holding over 40% of the token’s total supply, including its holdings in escrow. It is worth noting that XRP Ledger (XRPL) validator Vet revealed that Ripple sent $500 million in XRP to a new account. He said that the account is not escrowed and doesn’t have multi sig, which he claimed is surprising given the account value. This has led to speculation that the transfer may be related to the $1 billion treasury firm the crypto firm is looking to set up. In addition to the $1 billion fundraise for an XRP treasury firm, Ripple also recently acquired GTreasury for $1 billion, expanding into the corporate treasury markets. This is also considered another major win for XRP, as Ripple and GTreasury plan to let customers use the crypto firm’s payment solution for real-time cross-border transactions, which they facilitate using XRP. Significance Of The XRP Treasury Firm XRP commentator Kahneman noted the significance of the SPAC in Ripple’s plans to set up a $1 billion XRP treasury firm. He explained that this would be a publicly disclosed, regulated liquidity pool capable of handling corporate treasury flows. Meanwhile, Ripple just bought GTreasury , meaning that both moves could be intertwined. Kahneman further remarked that a SPAC would let the payment firm offer a regulated liquidity pool that corporate treasuries can use, even though the crypto firm is a private company. He added that this separates Ripple’s operating business from a compliant pool. Therefore, the XRP commentator opined that this could signal that the crypto firm intends to remain private for a while longer. Ripple has so far not revealed any plans for a potential IPO despite the XRP lawsuit already ending. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.32, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",XRP|Coinmarketcap|GTreasury|IPO|Kahneman|ripple|spac|Special Purpose Acquisition Company|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRP Treasury|XRPL|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-19 01:30:25

We are a strong economy. We are four hundred fifty million people… So we should play the European card in a more offensive way.” The economist, who also sits on the European Central Bank’s Governing Council, made it clear that the continent should not rely on others to protect its markets. “The most important market for the European is Europe itself,” he said. Trump’s on-and-off-again tariffs on China this year have triggered a new wave of retaliation from Beijing, forcing Chinese exporters to redirect goods to markets like Europe, where they are often sold below local production costs. Economists warn that this is squeezing European manufacturers while Beijing’s restrictions on rare earths, materials critical for technology and defense industries, further deepen the imbalance. Across China, European companies continue to struggle against heavily subsidized domestic competitors, according to Reuters. Netherlands takes control of Nexperia amid pressure from Washington Now earlier this week, the Dutch government seized Nexperia, a semiconductor company that produces basic chips for automobiles, consumer electronics, and industrial devices, from its Chinese owner and chief executive Zhang Xuezheng. The takeover, approved in 2017, was reversed under an emergency law citing “preservation of crucial technological knowledge, as well as production and development capacities in the Netherlands and Europe.” Economy Minister Vincent Karremans told parliament on Saturday that Zhang had improperly transferred intellectual property and financial resources to a foreign entity he controlled, even after all the warnings from Washington, which had already blacklisted Zhang’s company Wingtech in December and placed heavy export restrictions. When U.S. officials informed The Hague that upcoming rule changes would expand those limits to include Nexperia, the Dutch government took control on September 30. Beijing condemned the seizure, with the China Chamber of Commerce to the EU calling it a “modern act of economic banditry.” Following the decision, China banned the export of certain Nexperia products assembled within its borders. Analysts from the Rhodium Group described the situation as part of Washington’s unspoken effort to “claw back strategic assets” from Chinese hands under the pretext of national security. While The Hague denied acting under U.S. direction, court filings revealed clear American pressure during the process. The fallout has also highlighted the growing complexity of Europe’s semiconductor supply chain. Even with production on European soil, dependence on China persists for assembly and raw materials. The European Union’s Chips Act, which aims to produce 20% of global chips by 2030, is already struggling, with multiple projects delayed or abandoned. China tightens rare earth exports as Europe lags behind As the Nexperia case unfolded, China introduced sweeping new restrictions on rare earth exports, mirroring U.S. technology bans. The move threatens to disrupt supply chains vital to European industries, particularly the automotive and defense sectors. Partial curbs have already driven up costs and delayed production. Europe, with its heavy investments in electric vehicles and wind energy, stands more exposed than the United States. The EU’s Critical Raw Materials Act, passed last year to diversify supply chains, has stalled. A €1 billion German fund meant to support critical mineral projects was paused, and progress toward reducing dependency remains slow. Rebecca Arcesati and Jacob Gunter from the Mercator Institute for China Studies argued that Europe must act “more decisively,” using subsidies and regulations to promote new mining and processing operations and stepping in as a “buyer of last resort” when needed. Meanwhile, Beijing’s export bans have pushed European leaders to rethink their approach. The European Commission has accused China of flooding markets with underpriced industrial goods and ignoring calls to reduce overcapacity. The EU first imposed tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, but that barely dented sales, it only prompted Beijing to retaliate with its own tariffs on European brandy, pork, and dairy imports. Trade analyst Noah Barkin, writing for the German Marshall Fund, described the episode as proof that “the EU has been too slow, too timid, and too wedded to a rulebook the others have torn up.” During her July trip to Beijing, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU-China relationship had reached an “inflection point.” Some of the plans under review by the EU are:- tighter restrictions on steel imports, mandatory local content rules, and technology-sharing requirements for new Chinese investments in apparently the entirety of Europe. But the main question, officials reportedly admit, is whether EU capitals are ready to use those tools or keep waiting while others set the rules. That remains to be seen.

The decision came on Friday, October 18, from U.S. District Judge Phyllis Hamilton, who signed a 25-page order laying out the permanent injunction. According to Reuters, the court’s order shuts down any attempt by NSO to use its spyware tools on Meta-owned WhatsApp, a platform used by over two billion people around the world. The spyware in question is Pegasus, NSO’s main product, which is designed to exploit vulnerabilities in everyday apps and secretly monitor phones. That includes grabbing texts, calls, and location data. For years, Pegasus has used WhatsApp as a key entry point. That ends now. In court filings, NSO warned that if the judge blocked them from going after WhatsApp, it would “put NSO’s entire enterprise at risk” and potentially “force NSO out of business.” Judge reduces damages from $167 million to $4 million While the injunction hit hard, Judge Phyllis Hamilton also gave NSO a financial break. A previous jury decision had slapped the company with $167 million in punitive damages owed to Meta, but the judge cut that figure down to just $4 million. That’s a 97% reduction, which NSO said it “welcomed.” Still, the legal blow from the permanent ban on targeting WhatsApp outweighed the financial relief. NSO, based in Israel, released a statement saying the ban doesn’t apply to their clients. The company said its customers “will continue using the company’s technology to help protect public safety.” NSO also said it’s still reviewing the judge’s ruling and “will determine its next steps accordingly.” No timeline was given. Meanwhile, Meta executives responded to the ruling with satisfaction. Will Cathcart, head of WhatsApp, posted on X (formerly Twitter): “Today’s ruling bans spyware maker NSO from ever targeting WhatsApp and our global users again. We applaud this decision that comes after six years of litigation to hold NSO accountable for targeting members of civil society.” This judgment comes just weeks after reports surfaced that NSO was bought by a group led by Hollywood producer Robert Simonds. The acquisition was reported by TechCrunch, though Simonds has not responded to requests for comment. Meta updates WhatsApp API terms to block AI chatbot developers While dealing with the NSO ruling, Meta quietly made another major move. The company changed WhatsApp’s Business API policy this week to ban general-purpose AI chatbot developers from the platform. That change will affect developers behind OpenAI, Perplexity, Luzia (backed by Khosla Ventures), and Poke (backed by General Catalyst). The updated policy adds a new section aimed directly at “AI Providers.” That includes companies developing or distributing large language models, generative AI platforms, or any tool considered a general-purpose AI assistant. Under the new rules, these AI providers are forbidden from accessing or using the WhatsApp Business Solution, whether they’re doing so directly or indirectly. Meta made it clear that the ban is only on AI companies where chatbot services are the main offering. Businesses using AI for basic customer support tasks won’t be affected. A travel company, for example, can still run a simple customer service bot. The new rules will go into effect on January 15th, as Meta explained in its press release, adding that the original intent of the Business API was for business-to-customer communications, not as a launchpad for third-party chatbots. The company said it noticed more developers using the API for general-purpose chatbots recently—something it never intended when building the system. The entire update shows Meta trying to tighten control over how WhatsApp is used. That includes shutting out AI assistants that don’t align with its vision for the platform.

Speaking in Washington during the IMF’s annual meetings, Lagarde said fiscal policy “will play a more supportive role in the years ahead,” especially for countries increasing defense investments, pointing out that “this is certainly the case (in a big way) by Germany, where major military and infrastructure investments are underway.” Lagarde added that those projects “are just beginning to have an impact but will be rolled out over the next three years in a very significant way,” according to Bloomberg. Lagarde said Germany is finally “using its balance sheet and its capacity to borrow,” signaling the end of its long-standing reluctance to spend. Much of that change comes from Friedrich Merz, the new German chancellor, who pushed through a landmark spending bill before even taking office. The plan unlocks federal borrowing to rebuild Germany’s infrastructure and overhaul its military. Lagarde described it bluntly: “Agent of change Germany — who would have thought?” Germany boosts growth plans with €400 billion investment drive Sharing the stage with Lagarde, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva praised the decision.“My message is: bravo, bravo, bravo,” she said.“Because what Germany is demonstrating is that imbalances can be addressed, it is a matter of will, and mostly political will.” Georgieva’s remarks came as optimism builds across Europe that Germany’s fiscal push could lift growth in the region, which has long relied on the country’s cautious approach to spending. Earlier this week, Merz proposed creating a pan-European stock exchange to strengthen competitiveness against the United States and Asia. Lagarde reacted to the plan, saying, “When I hear the German chancellor say we need in Europe one single stock market, one single supervision — that means a lot. How that will materialize, how it will take place, how it will work out, I don’t know.” The spending program, secured before Merz took office last month, could add more than €400 billion ($470 billion) to Germany’s annual output by 2030, according to the German government’s panel of economic advisers. That would lift average GDP growth by 1.6%, slightly above the long-term pace since reunification in 1990. Monika Schnitzer, the panel’s chair, said expectations among businesses and the public are “extremely high,” adding that “action must be taken quickly.” Investors rally as Germany emerges from years of restraint Investor confidence in Germany, meanwhile, has been rising all year. The DAX index has hit new records, making it one of the best-performing stock markets this year, behind only Spain’s IBEX and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng. The enthusiasm proves the growing belief that Germany is regaining economic momentum at a time of political uncertainty in the United States under President Donald Trump. After years of tight budgets, Germany holds the lowest debt-to-GDP ratio among G7 nations, giving it space to borrow for growth. Economists say the turnaround represents the biggest policy change in a generation. But challenges remain; political divisions and weak coordination could slow down progress if not handled carefully. Deutsche Bank upgraded its growth forecast on the back of Merz’s fiscal plan, predicting 2% growth for Germany next year. Still, the bank warned that momentum might fade if funds are funneled into consumption rather than investment. Alexander von zur Mühlen, Deutsche Bank’s head of Asia-Pacific, said, “Outside of Europe they say: the sleeping giant Germany has woken up. We need to use the momentum.” Economic advisers reportedly cautioned that if spending is directed toward short-term relief like cutting restaurant taxes or incentives for electric vehicles, instead of long-term infrastructure, rail, and technology, the growth effect could be halved. For now, Germany’s economic comeback is being tested by whether it can turn massive borrowing into lasting results, without losing focus or wasting its newfound fiscal power.

That means a worker earning the federal minimum wage would need to work nearly three full weeks to afford a single ounce. The gold price closed around $4,225 per ounce at press time, while average hourly earnings stood at $36.50 in August, leaving income growth far behind. The ratio has doubled in only 18 months, smashing previous all-time highs of 80 hours seen during the 1930s, 1980, and 2011. At the start of this millennium, the same ounce cost less than 20 hours of labor, a reminder of how far this metal has outrun real wages. Gold’s rally has accelerated as investors pile in, betting on rate cuts from the Federal Reserve and global counterparts, as well as looking for safety amid growing geopolitical tension. The metal has surged by 64% so far this year, helped by central bank buying, outflows from the U.S. dollar, and strong inflows into exchange-traded funds tied to gold. Markets are now betting on a 25-basis-point cut at the October meeting and another in December, fueling even more optimism among traders who see the metal climbing beyond $4,400 in the coming years. Gold drops after record high above $4,300 amid Trump’s tariff remarks After a week of euphoria, gold prices slipped on Friday, retreating 2.6% to $4,211.48 per ounce bymidday, after hitting an all-time high of $4,378.69 earlier in the session. US gold futures for December delivery also dipped 2.1% to $4,213.30, while the dollar index rose 0.1%, making bullion more expensive for overseas buyers. President Donald Trump told reporters that a “full-scale” tariff on China would be unsustainable, cooling some of the speculation that had driven gold higher through the week. “I think Trump’s more conciliatory tone since the initial announcement of 100% tariffs has taken a little heat out of the precious trade,” said Tai Wong, an independent metals trader in New York. Trump confirmed that he would meet with his Chinese counterpart, a decision that slightly eased market jitters over the escalating trade conflict. Even with the pullback, gold was on pace for a 4.8% weekly gain, its biggest since September 2008, when the collapse of Lehman Brothers sent investors scrambling for safety. Suki Cooper, head of commodities research at Standard Chartered Bank, said her team expects gold to average $4,488 in 2026, adding that “broader structural factors” could push prices even higher. HSBC raised its 2025 forecast by $100 to $3,455 per ounce, projecting a potential climb to $5,000 by 2026. Physical demand in Asia also stayed solid despite record prices, with Indian premiums rising to a decade-high ahead of local festivals. Meanwhile, silver fell 5.6% to $51.20, after touching $54.47, while platinum slid 6.1% to $1,607.85 and palladium lost 7.9% to $1,485.50. Speculative excess grows as gold enters its third breakout in 50 years This is the third breakout for gold in five decades, following the 1979–1980 and 2010–2011 booms, both of which ended in brutal crashes. In those eras, investors feared the Federal Reserve would allow inflation to destroy the dollar. During the 1970s, the Fed was seen as bowing to political pressure from President Richard Nixon, while after the 2008 crisis, many worried that massive bond purchases would debase the currency. Both fears proved wrong. In the early 1980s, the Fed’s aggressive tightening halved gold’s value in two years. It took over 25 years for the metal to reclaim its 1980 peak, and only this year did it surpass that inflation-adjusted level. After 2011, gold tumbled for five years before rebounding in 2020, yet it was still cheaper as recently as two years ago. Now, the surge looks eerily similar to past speculative frenzies. While investors argue “this time is different,” the pattern of rapid gains and euphoric buying hasn’t changed. The push for alternatives to the dollar has intensified since the freezing of Russian reserves after the Ukraine invasion, driving central banks across developing nations to boost gold holdings over fears that Western assets might be vulnerable in a crisis.

Notably, the leading cryptocurrency dipped below $105,000 on Friday as crypto liquidations rose to above $1.2 billion. However, underlying investor buying activity paints an encouraging picture of a potentially bullish rebound. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Price Is Ready To Surge: ‘We Would Already Be Below $108,000 If The Crash Wasn’t Over’ Bitcoin Net Taker Volume Hits $309 Million Despite Price Fall In a QuickTake post on X, popular analyst Amr Taha shares an exchange activity update on the Bitcoin market amidst a significant price correction. The pundit reports a major uptick in buying pressure, which suggests investors may be quietly accumulating despite the present price weakness. Notably, on-chain data shows that the Bitcoin crash to below $105,000 coincided with a spike in the net taker volume on Binance to around $309 million, marking its first positive zone since October 10. In trading terms, buy-taker volume represents orders that actively hit the ask, i.e., traders willing to buy immediately at market price rather than waiting for a better entry. The move indicates that, despite short-term volatility, there remains a deep undercurrent of bullish conviction among Bitcoin holders and traders. This high accumulation activity during a price demand usually precedes local bottom formations, as aggressive buyers absorb selling pressure, setting the stage for a parabolic price rebound. Furthermore, while the taker volume surged, Amr Taha reports that the open interest (OI), which measures the total number of outstanding futures and perpetual contracts, failed to rise in tandem. This divergence suggests that trading activity is concentrated in the spot market rather than in leveraged derivatives, reinforcing the fact that investors are actively participating in the present market state. In summary, the renowned crypto analyst views this exchange activity development as a potential bullish undercurrent. Taha explains that spot accumulation around key liquidity levels, such as the $105K zone, often serves as a foundation for future price recoveries once selling pressure subsides.

However, the expert anticipates the premier cryptocurrency may still see a further decline before eventually finding a bottom around $92,000. In line with a growing notion, Jebb hinges his bullish thesis on a potential rotation of capital from the gold market to Bitcoin once the former hits a new market peak. Notably, gold is currently maintaining an impressive bullish momentum, having become the first asset to surpass a $30 trillion market capitalization value. Jebb predicts an eventual capital rotation when the gold market starts to correct, with potential inflows expected to push Bitcoin to around the $150,000 price mark in January.

The Seattle-based cybersecurity company admitted in filings that its systems had been compromised for nearly two years, allowing attackers “long-term, persistent access” to its internal infrastructure. The breach reportedly exposed source code, sensitive configuration data, and information about undisclosed software vulnerabilities in its BIG-IP platform, a technology that powers the networks of 85% of Fortune 500 companies and many US federal agencies. The hackers broke in through F5’s own software, which had been left exposed online after employees failed to follow internal security policies. The attackers exploited that weak point to enter and roam freely inside systems that should have been locked down. F5 company told customers that the oversight directly violated the same cyber guidelines the company teaches its clients to follow. When the news broke, F5’s shares fell more than 10% on October 16, wiping out millions in market value. “Since that vulnerability information is out there, everyone using F5 should assume they’re compromised,” said Chris Woods, a former security executive with HP who is now founder of CyberQ Group Ltd., a cybersecurity services firm in the UK. Hackers used F5’s own technology to maintain stealth and control F5 sent customers on Wednesday a threat hunting guide for a type of malware called Brickstorm used by Chinese state-backed hackers, according to Bloomberg. Mandiant, which was hired by F5, confirmed that Brickstorm allowed hackers to move quietly through VMware virtual machines and deeper infrastructure. After securing their foothold, the intruders stayed inactive for over a year, an old but effective tactic meant to outwait the company’s security log retention period. Logs, which record every digital trace, are often deleted after 12 months to save costs. Once those logs were gone, the hackers reactivated and pulled data from BIG-IP, including source code and vulnerability reports. F5 said that while some customer data was accessed, it has no real evidence that hackers changed its source code or used the stolen information to exploit clients. F5’s BIG-IP platform handles load balancing and network security, routing digital traffic and shielding systems from intrusion. US and UK governments issue emergency warnings The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) called the incident a “significant cyber threat targeting federal networks.” In an emergency directive issued on Wednesday, CISA ordered all federal agencies to identify and update their F5 products by October 22. The UK’s National Cyber Security Centre also issued an alert about the breach on Wednesday, warning that hackers could use their access to F5 systems to exploit the company’s technology and to identify additional vulnerabilities. Following the disclosure, F5 CEO Francois Locoh-Donou held briefings with customers to explain the scope of the breach. Francois confirmed that the company had called in CrowdStrike and Google’s Mandiant to assist alongside law enforcement and government investigators. Officials familiar with the probe allegedly told Bloomberg that the Chinese government was behind the attack. But a Chinese spokesperson dismissed the accusation as “groundless and made without evidence.” Ilia Rabinovich, Sygnia’s vice president of cybersecurity consulting, said that in the case Sygnia disclosed last year, hackers hid inside F5’s appliances and used them as a “command and control” base to infiltrate victim networks undetected. “There is a potential for it to evolve into something that is massive, because numerous organizations deploy those devices,” he said.

Yet, while retail traders exit in fear, seasoned investors — often referred to as “smart money” — are quietly rotating into smaller, high-upside plays that historically outperform following sharp market resets. Among these accumulation targets, HYPE and SUI have emerged as standout opportunities due to their on-chain growth and consistent whale activity. Meanwhile, investors are also tracking MAGACOIN FINANCE — a low-cap altcoin quietly building momentum as a potential early-cycle gem heading into 2025’s next major market rotation. XRP and Cardano Hit Oversold Zones Both XRP and Cardano have entered oversold territory, with RSI readings near their lowest levels in over six months. XRP is currently hovering around $2.20 , while ADA trades just above $0.60 . Analysts say this type of price action often signals the end of a correction phase, where institutional buyers begin scaling back into quality projects. Despite the near-term weakness, the underlying fundamentals of both coins remain strong — particularly XRP’s growing institutional adoption and Cardano’s continued DeFi expansion. Smart Money Rotates Into HYPE and SUI While retail sentiment remains shaky, whales have shifted focus to HYPE and SUI — two mid-cap altcoins showing impressive accumulation patterns. HYPE continues to dominate social sentiment rankings, with analysts predicting it could deliver 25x to 40x returns in the next market cycle. SUI , on the other hand, has benefited from a steady rise in developer activity and DeFi integrations, suggesting strong network growth heading into 2025. On-chain data supports the rotation trend, showing consistent wallet growth and capital inflows to both tokens during periods of broader market fear. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Ground as a Hidden Accumulation Play Beyond established altcoins, MAGACOIN FINANCE has captured early investor attention for its ability to sustain momentum through volatile market conditions. The project’s successful audit and active presale have built confidence among early backers who view it as a strategic accumulation target before the next bull phase. Analysts highlight MAGACOIN FINANCE’s rising community engagement and liquidity growth as signs that smart money is positioning early — echoing the accumulation behavior seen in successful early-stage tokens from previous market cycles. Analysts Expect a Rotation-Driven Recovery Historically, after large-cap coins like XRP and Cardano bottom out, smaller, undervalued projects tend to deliver outsized returns as the market rotates upward. This shift from safety to growth has been the catalyst behind every major bull cycle since 2017. If Bitcoin continues holding above $105K and sentiment recovers in November, analysts believe HYPE , SUI , and MAGACOIN FINANCE could be among the undervalued 2025 gems that lead the next phase of altcoin acceleration.

53356931,609263,1760842850,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53356931.jpeg,40 Days Of Deadlock: US Shutdown Risks ETF Delay Amid Soaring Demand,https://bitcoinist.com/40-days-of-deadlock-us-shutdown-risks-etf-delay-amid-soaring-demand/,"The US federal funding lapse has stretched on, creating new delays for regulatory decisions tied to crypto products. According to reports, the shutdown has lasted beyond 40 days in some scenarios used by market forecasters, and reduced staffing at federal agencies is slowing routine approvals. Shutdown Stretches Past 40 Days Reports have disclosed a market estimate putting the chance of a prolonged shutdown at about 55% for certain stretches, which traders say complicates timing for filings and reviews. The Securities and Exchange Commission is operating with fewer staff, and that has forced some rulemakings and approval windows to be pushed back. For applicants hoping for quick sign-offs, this means waiting longer than planned. Investor Interest Remains High Despite the holdup, investor appetite for regulated crypto products appears strong. According to filings and traffic data cited in market reports, clients of Charles Schwab hold roughly 20% of the US crypto ETF market by assets under custody, and web visits to crypto information pages have jumped about 90% on an annualized basis. That shows demand is not evaporating while regulators are idle. What That Means For Markets When reviews resume in force, some strategists expect pent-up demand to move into newly approved products. Based on reports, the delay has simply shifted the calendar rather than killed the approvals. Yet market reaction is not guaranteed to be large; some money may already be waiting on the sidelines, while other investors have moved on. Backlog Could Trigger A Fast Response Regulatory staff will face a backlog when full operations return. Papers awaiting attention may be prioritized, and several issuers will press to get decisions cleared. Sources tracking the space warn that a sudden cluster of approvals could follow the end of the funding gap, creating rapid inflows into the newly cleared funds. Risks Beyond Timing The shutdown is one of several risks. Reports point to the fact that approvals depend on legal arguments, compliance steps, and the agency’s view on market structure. A temporary staffing shortfall delays work, but it does not change the substantive questions the regulator must answer before signing off. That means some applications could still be rejected or heavily conditioned.

He mentioned plans to monitor its intraday chart closely for potential quick scalp opportunities, particularly if LINK holds above $16.80, which he views as a positive zone. A Possible Shift In Chainlink’s Current Bearish Action Moving on, CryptoWzrd pointed out that both Chainlink and LINKBTC closed the day with bearish candles, signaling short-term weakness. The downside move came after a period of consolidation, suggesting that traders may be taking profits following recent gains. Despite the pullback, the analyst emphasized that the overall market context still holds potential for recovery. Related Reading: Chainlink Targets $22 As LINKBTC Shows Signs Of Reversal – Is The Next Rally Close? He further explained that LINKBTC could experience an upward push if Bitcoin dominance shows positive sentiment tomorrow. A recovery in Bitcoin’s strength often translates to renewed confidence in the broader altcoin market, and LINK could benefit from this correlation. According to CryptoWzrd, LINK’s retest of the $16 daily support level played out exactly as anticipated. This zone now represents a crucial decision point, holding above it could trigger a rebound toward the next major resistance of $20 and beyond if market conditions remain stable. However, he cautioned that with the weekend approaching, volatility may rise and market volume could thin out. As a result, CryptoWzrd maintained a balanced stance, noting that it is essential to keep expectations rational and remain alert for any signs of renewed bearish pressure. Bullish Breakout Could Ignite A Rally Toward $19.30 Concluding his analysis, CryptoWzrd noted that Chainlink’s intraday chart displayed notable volatility throughout the day, with rapid price swings keeping traders on edge. Despite the choppy movements, the price is now teasing the $16.80 intraday resistance, a level that could play a pivotal role in determining the next short-term direction. Related Reading: Chainlink (LINK) Triangle Setup Points To $100, Says Analyst He explained that a bullish breakout above $16.80 would likely trigger a wave of renewed buying pressure. Such a move could pave the way for a rally toward the $19.30 target, an area where previous price action has shown a strong reaction and potential for profit-taking. On the other hand, CryptoWzrd cautioned that a rejection from $16.80 or prolonged trading below this resistance could lead to more sideways movement over the weekend. With lower trading volumes expected, this range-bound behavior may continue until a clear catalyst emerges to drive momentum in either direction. He concluded by emphasizing the importance of patience and clarity in the current setup. The market is at a decision point, and waiting for a stronger trade formation could offer a safer entry opportunity.

Although it tried to recover some ground in the following days, the Friday market-wide correction pushed it south once again, and it is currently fighting to stay above $0.20. Here’s what ChatGPT, Grok, and Gemini predict about its performance in the week ahead. What’s Next for PI? From a top 20 altcoin by market cap to barely remaining in the largest 80 club, PI has experienced its fair share of price collapses. Unfortunately for the Pi Network investor base, the three AIs did not give much hope for the asset’s performance in the following seven days. However, this might not be entirely its fault, as the entire market has been struggling for over a week now. In terms of technical markers, Grok noted that the first line of defense for PI is the recent all-time low at around $0.17-$0.18. If that support is breached, there are no historical levels that can support it on the way down. On the more positive side, though, it said that the RSI is heavily oversold (well below 30), which could result in a “short-term relief rally.” However, PI needs to see some more (buying) volume, as the current weak levels display “low speculative interest.” According to Gemini, PI can initiate a more substantial rebound only if it reclaims the first key resistance zones at $0.22 and $0.24, where it was rejected earlier this week. Still Bears’ Country ChatGPT was predominantly bearish on PI’s short-term price performance. It asserted that the adverse price moves are likely to continue in the following days, putting a 60% chance for a bearish continuation. “If $0.20 fails to hold, sellers could push PI toward a new low between $0.15–$0.17. Thin liquidity means even small sell orders can trigger sharp dips.” Consequently, the chances for a quick rebound are lower – somewhere around 25% to 30%, while a price stabilization and consolidation at these levels have a 15% probability, according to the OpenAI solution. “Expect continued weakness and possible new lows before any meaningful rebound. Without fresh momentum or external listings, PI will likely trade between $0.17–$0.23 next week, reflecting a fragile and speculative market phase,” ChatGPT noted at the end.

After a month-long correction, on-chain data suggests whale accumulation is quietly returning across major altcoins. Analysts say assets like Cardano (ADA) and SUI are now entering deeply oversold zones, creating what some call “the perfect volatility window” for explosive gains once market sentiment shifts. While blue-chip cryptos consolidate, investors seeking earlier exposure are turning to MAGACOIN FINANCE — a rising Ethereum-based project that’s attracting high engagement and fresh capital inflows from traders betting on new-cycle narratives. Ethereum’s Correction May Signal Accumulation Phase Despite the decline, Ethereum remains structurally strong. Analysts highlight that ETH’s RSI near 35 mirrors previous reversal points that preceded multi-month rallies. Open interest on derivatives has cooled, reducing downside risk, while whale wallets continue moving coins off exchanges — a sign of confidence returning. If ETH reclaims $3,900–$4,000 , it could confirm the start of a new accumulation phase leading into the year-end altcoin rebound. Cardano and SUI Flash Bullish Divergences Cardano and SUI are showing similar price exhaustion signals. ADA has tested long-term support near $0.59 , while SUI’s volume and address activity are both up double digits week-over-week. Market strategists say these are early signs of smart money repositioning ahead of the next rotation wave. Analysts expect a synchronized rally once Ethereum stabilizes, potentially kicking off one of the strongest altcoin phases since early 2023. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Momentum Ahead of Exchange Access While most projects slow down in bearish markets, MAGACOIN FINANCE is accelerating — both in investor growth and market visibility. Backed by a verified audit and rising global community participation, the project has become a go-to hedge for investors looking beyond short-term volatility. Industry analysts note that MAGACOIN FINANCE’s next major catalyst — the upcoming exchange listing phase — could act as a price discovery event , opening access to a wider trading audience. With a growing base of loyal holders and increasing exposure among Ethereum and Cardano traders, many see it as a strong speculative contender in the next rotation cycle. Analysts Predict Market Rotation Into Q4 Crypto markets thrive on rotation, and analysts believe that once Ethereum stabilizes, capital will move quickly into undervalued altcoins. Historically, such rotations have fueled some of the most profitable multi-week runs across DeFi and presale tokens. As ADA and SUI flash bottom signals, and accumulation builds around Ethereum-based newcomers like MAGACOIN FINANCE, analysts say this setup could mirror the early 2021 cycle — where smart money accumulation preceded months of sustained growth.

Here’s What Happened",https://timestabloid.com/investor-3000000-xrp-just-stolen-from-my-cold-wallet-heres-what-happened/,"A recent post from Digital Asset Investor (@digitalassetbuy) on X revealed a distressing account from a longtime XRP holder who says he lost his entire digital fortune to theft. The post captioned a link to a YouTube video by the victim, Brandon, who explained how over $3 million worth of XRP was stolen from his cold wallet. Brandon, a 54-year-old from North Carolina, described himself as cautious, saying he had stored his seed phrase securely and avoided disclosing information online. Despite these measures, his balance of more than 1.2 million XRP vanished within minutes on a Sunday morning. Horrible story. If there’s anyone out there that can help this man please contact him. I just had over $3,000,000 of XRP stolen off of my cold wallet https://t.co/BXohJ89TaD via @YouTube — Digital Asset Investor (@digitalassetbuy) October 18, 2025 How the Theft Occurred In the video , Brandon explained that his assets were held on an Ellipal cold wallet. He said he discovered the theft after checking his balance early in the morning. According to his account, small test transactions were made before nearly all his XRP was moved to a single newly created wallet. Within minutes, those funds were distributed into hundreds of other wallets. He recalled, “I woke up and all my XRP’s been stolen, been hacked.” The loss, he claimed, represents the retirement savings for him and his wife. Brandon noted that while he had small holdings in other assets such as XLM and FLR, only his XRP was taken. The speed and complexity of the transfer suggest the involvement of sophisticated actors . Brandon said he immediately reported the case to the FBI through the IC3 portal and contacted his local sheriff’s department and the State Bureau of Investigation. However, neither had the resources to address a cybercrime of this type . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Challenge of Recovery Brandon’s next steps, as he described them, have been uncertain. He said that online searches led him to companies claiming to specialize in recovering stolen crypto , but he was unsure which ones to trust. Some of these firms requested payment in advance, while others charged high commission fees on any recovered assets. “I read some of them are great. I read some of them they’re all frauds,” he said, reflecting the uncertainty many face after such losses. For now, he continues to await a response from federal authorities. Digital Asset Investor called for any experts available in the community to help recover the stolen funds. Security as a Priority This case serves as a stark reminder of the importance of personal security practices in cryptocurrency custody. While many experts advise investors to hold their XRP in cold wallets , even these systems are vulnerable if any component of their setup is compromised. Brandon’s case shows that security needs more than offline storage, and regular checks and secure firmware are essential.

Data from Dune Analytics shows Robinhood’s tokenized assets now exceed $8.5 million in value at press time. Around $19.3 million worth of tokens have been minted overall, while about $11.5 million have already been burned. Robinhood adds more tokenized stocks for EU users through Arbitrum Dune’s data also tells us that roughly 70% of Robinhood’s on-chain assets are stocks, with another 24% being exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The rest are:- a tiny sliver goes into commodities, crypto-based ETFs, and even US Treasurys. The latest names in Robinhood’s batch for stocks are Galaxy (GLXY), Webull (BULL), and Synopsys (SNPS). Tom Wan, a research analyst who has been tracking the expansion for nearly six months now, said, “Robinhood EU users now have a wider range of US Stocks, Equities, and ETFs, thanks to Tokenization.” Back in June, Cryptopolitan reported that Robinhood built a dedicated Layer-2 blockchain on Arbitrum just for this purpose, to give European users access to tokenized versions of American securities. But these tokens don’t represent direct ownership of the actual stocks. Instead, they’re derivatives, tied to the underlying asset prices but regulated under the MiFID II rulebook (that’s Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II, for those keeping track). The tokens are designed to be cheap and accessible. Robinhood claims there’s no hidden fee beyond a 0.1% FX charge, and you can start trading with as little as 1 euro, about $1.17, and even more, trades are 24/7. But not everyone’s clapping. In July, the Bank of Lithuania, which handles Robinhood’s regulation in the EU, stepped in and asked the company to explain how these tokens are legally structured. Vlad Tenev, the company’s CEO, said they’re open to that kind of review. Robinhood pushes tokenization alongside crypto derivatives and acquisitions The token push comes shortly after Robinhood rolled out micro futures contracts for Bitcoin, XRP, and Solana, dragging crypto deeper into its platform. In May, the company grabbed WonderFi, a Canadian crypto platform, in a deal worth $179 million. The goal is to expand the global reach and add more regulated crypto activity to the platform. Robinhood is also trying to push US regulators to catch up, as the company submitted a full proposal to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), asking for a national framework that would oversee all these real-world asset (RWA) tokens under one consistent set of rules. Even with all that crypto energy, Robinhood’s core business still relies on one thing: trading revenue. Over 50% of its money comes directly from trades, compared to Charles Schwab’s 16%. Schwab makes most of its money from banking products, retirement funds, and advisor fees. That makes Schwab less vulnerable in a downturn. Robinhood, on the other hand, is built around a younger, less wealthy crowd; you know, folks who might bail if things get tight. Robinhood knows that. So, over the past few years, it’s added more traditional financial tools to its platform: retirement portfolios, high-yield savings accounts, and most recently, the acquisition of TradePMR, a network of registered investment advisers. That deal closed earlier this year. Still, its users only hold an average balance of $10,000, which is less than 4% of what Schwab customers typically carry.

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $2.65 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $4.14. Tezos started strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos survive?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis.

The MACD and RSI show weak bullish momentum. A break above $0.60 could target $0.63, while losing $0.55 may deepen the correction. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart Tezos (XTZ) is currently trading around $0.586 on October 19, hovering close to the lower Bollinger Band at $0.542, indicating limited downside room before a possible rebound. The upper Bollinger Band at $0.755 marks the next major resistance, but the middle band at $0.649 poses the first significant hurdle for any upward attempt. The price has been consistently closing below the 20-day moving average, suggesting sustained bearish sentiment. XTZUSDT 1-day price chart | Source: TradingView The MACD histogram remains negative and the signal lines are widening slightly below zero, showing continued bearish pressure, although momentum is weakening slightly. Meanwhile, OBV sits around 1.12B, showing flat volume movement and a lack of fresh accumulation. A breakout above $0.65 could signal the start of a recovery toward $0.70–$0.75. However, failure to hold $0.55 could open the door toward $0.50 in the short term. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart On the 4-hour timeframe, Tezos trades at $0.587, wedged between short-term resistance at $0.593 and local support at $0.584. The Alligator indicator lines remain intertwined, reflecting indecision and a sideways market. XTZUSDT 4-hour price chart | Source: TradingView The RSI at 41.7 shows mild bearishness without being oversold, suggesting the asset still has room to dip slightly before buyers regain control. Price rejection near the $0.60–$0.61 zone indicates a lack of conviction from bulls. If XTZ can close above $0.595, it may attempt to test $0.615–$0.63. Conversely, breaking below $0.584 would likely trigger a retest of $0.56, and possibly $0.55 as seen in the daily chart’s lower band.

Tezos remains range-bound but tilting bearish in the short term. The market may see another dip toward $0.55 before bulls step in for a relief rally toward $0.63–$0.65. Momentum indicators suggest a cautious accumulation phase rather than an aggressive breakout environment. Is Tezos a long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs, so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $2 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance and decentralized applications.

Both Solana (SOL) and SUI are flashing strong bullish divergences on major technical indicators — a classic reversal signal that has historically preceded explosive recoveries. As the Crypto Fear & Greed Index plunges toward multi-month lows near 26 , analysts believe this environment could mark the beginning of a massive accumulation window for those seeking early 2025 exposure. Meanwhile, momentum is quietly building around MAGACOIN FINANCE — an emerging presale project that’s being described by some as a “smart money magnet.” With listings approaching and investor participation surging, the project is drawing comparisons to early-stage altcoins that delivered 50x+ gains in previous market cycles. Solana and SUI Flash Strong Technical Reversal Signals Technical analysts have identified bullish divergences between price action and momentum on both Solana and SUI charts. Solana’s RSI remains flat while price dips lower — a setup that has historically triggered rebounds of over 100%. Likewise, SUI’s MACD is turning upward even as price consolidates, suggesting buying pressure beneath the surface . Whale tracking platforms have also reported rising on-chain accumulation across both tokens, with address growth and stablecoin inflows increasing week over week — a classic sign of institutional repositioning. Fear Index at Bottom Levels — The Opportunity Window The Fear Index hitting the 25–28 zone often signals maximum pessimism in the market, a level that has historically aligned with some of the best long-term entry points. Analysts point out that similar conditions in March 2023 and May 2024 preceded multi-month rallies of over 200% in large-cap altcoins. This pattern — known as the “fear cycle reset” — tends to shift market control from retail panic sellers to long-term accumulators. As sentiment resets, early-stage assets frequently see the largest percentage gains as liquidity rotates downward. MAGACOIN FINANCE Captures Smart Money Attention While traders look for rebound opportunities in established names, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly emerging as one of the most closely watched presale plays of 2025. The project has seen rapid investor growth in recent weeks, supported by verified audits , expanding social engagement, and heightened anticipation around its upcoming exchange listings . Analysts note that MAGACOIN FINANCE’s growing momentum reflects a familiar pattern — where early presale tokens become smart money accumulation targets ahead of major market reversals. Many now view it as a contrarian play — one that could mirror the breakout trajectories of 2021-era low-cap winners once price discovery begins. Analysts Predict 30x ROI Potential With Solana, SUI, and MAGACOIN FINANCE showing strength at the height of fear, analysts believe the next leg higher could deliver outsized returns. Historical models indicate that coins flashing bullish divergences at RSI lows often deliver 20x–30x ROI during the first half of a new cycle. As capital begins rotating from defensive holdings into growth-focused assets, traders are now positioning early — with Solana , SUI , and MAGACOIN FINANCE standing out as top contenders for the next exponential move.

According to his latest post and accompanying video analysis, XRP has just replicated a technical setup identical to the one that preceded its last 600% move. He suggested that while many traders are preoccupied with Bitcoin’s dominance and short-term volatility, XRP may be entering a phase that will realign market dynamics. In his presentation, Ripple Van Winkle argued that the current correction across major cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin’s sharp drop from recent highs, is part of a broader engineered pattern. He pointed to ongoing liquidations on Binance, which he claimed are removing leveraged positions and redirecting liquidity from Bitcoin into altcoins, especially utility-driven assets such as XRP. He stated that this behavior has been consistent in prior cycles, where institutional money shifts away from Bitcoin at its peak into projects positioned for long-term adoption . EVERYONE MISSED IT — the $XRP chart just *flipped* the entire market. While everyone’s staring at Bitcoin dominance, XRP just printed the same pattern that triggered the last 600% move. Most people won’t see it until it’s already up 5x. pic.twitter.com/kQqAw9Cg1F — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) October 17, 2025 XRP’s Position in the Market Cycle Ripple Van Winkle provided detailed technical observations, identifying $2.10 as a critical support level for XRP. He noted that if XRP maintains that zone and reclaims $2.30 on the daily chart, it would confirm a bear trap and potentially drive a rally toward $2.60 to $2.80. In his view, a breakout above $3.10 would mark a macro reversal, signaling the continuation of the broader upward trend. He also highlighted historical parallels, noting that XRP experienced a nearly identical pattern in July, when a 30% drop was followed by a sharp recovery that doubled the token’s value. The analyst believes a similar move could repeat, provided key technical conditions are met. He emphasized that the shakeout currently unfolding is not a signal of collapse but rather a preparatory stage before the next leg higher, mirroring previous market rotations. Broader Market and Bitcoin Outlook Regarding Bitcoin , Ripple Van Winkle observed that the asset remains in a larger uptrend on higher time frames, though the recent daily lower low has broken short-term structure. He expects Bitcoin to eventually target between $140,000 and $170,000, possibly even reaching $200,000 once the liquidation phase subsides. Until then, he said the $104,000 zone remains a pivotal level, where market sentiment shifts from panic to accumulation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He described the current volatility as a “controlled liquidation,” engineered to exhaust over-leveraged traders before the next upward phase. As long as Bitcoin remains above its long-term support, he maintained that this period represents an accumulation opportunity rather than the end of the cycle. XRP Remains Technically Bullish Ripple Van Winkle concluded that XRP’s structure remains technically bullish, with higher highs and higher lows maintained since June. He views the recent retracement as a healthy reset rather than a breakdown. According to his analysis, a confirmed reversal above $2.30 could rapidly propel XRP back toward the $4 range once macro resistance levels are cleared. He added that the capital rotation from Bitcoin to altcoins typically marks the transition into the strongest segment of a bull cycle. If this pattern continues, he believes XRP may be positioned to outperform once again. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Addressing DeFi developers, Storm asked , “How can you be certain that the DOJ will not charge you as a money service business for building a non-custodial protocol?” With the growing uncertainties in the ecosystem, the founder warned that the DOJ could possibly create a case against them. This was after he argued that any decentralized, non-custodial service might have been established as a custodial service under regulatory scrutiny. Notably, Storm pointed out that this situation is similar to what he encountered earlier, as he referred to his recent motion for acquittal, which he submitted on September 30. Storm’s legal case raises concerns among the crypto community Following his court filings, Storm mentioned that his company cannot make any adjustments or alter the Tornado Cash protocol . According to him, the crypto program is a decentralized software protocol that no one entity or actor can manage. The Tornado Cash founder’s remarks came after he was declared guilty in August on one out of three allegations: the jury accused him of conspiring to operate a money transmission business without a license. This followed the US District Court for the Southern District of New York’s ruling that Storm was guilty of one felony charge related to his engagement with Tornado Cash, according to reports from Inner City Press. The ruling caused tension in the crypto ecosystem by raising legal concerns among open-source software developers and sending shockwaves through the crypto community. After the verdict, legal experts discussed whether US prosecutors would pursue charges against Storm for money laundering allegations and sanctions in a new trial. The jury, however, got stuck during their discussion and could not find a common ground on those accusations. They could only find Storm guilty of the unlicensed money transmitter charge. Although Strom has not yet been sentenced, reliable sources have highlighted that other crypto-related cases, like those involving OneCoin co-founder Karl Greenwood and former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, were tried in the same district. Both the executives were found guilty and are now serving time in prison. Recently, the Ethereum Foundation partnered with the Keyring network to fund the legal defense of Tornado Cash developers Roman Storm and Alexey Pertsev. As part of the initiative, all proceeds from Keyring’s zkVerified vaults, a yield-generating product on the Ethereum mainnet, will be used to support the legal defense of the two developers. For the next two months, 100% of protocol fees collected from the vaults will be directed to the legal fund. A statement on the defense legal fund’s landing page noted, “This is a joint effort with the Ethereum Foundation’s Funding Coordination Team to protect developers who build privacy-preserving technology.” Matthew Galeotti calls for clear methods in creating laws Regarding Storm’s case, the chief legal officer at Variant Fund, Jake Chervinsky, shared an X post pointing out that the Trump administration aims to position the US as the crypto capital of the world. With this goal in place, Chervinsky argues that it is inappropriate for the DOJ to retry any charges that caused a deadlock. In response to the chief legal officer’s statement, Matthew Galeotti, who is currently serving as the acting assistant attorney general for the DOJ’s criminal division, released a report dated August stating that the DOJ will not pursue a retrial of Storm and would not be moving forward on any other such cases. Speaking to the crowd at the American Innovation Project Summit, an event supporting regulatory reform and pro-crypto laws in the US, Galeotti expressed that they believe merely writing code without bad intentions is not a crime. He further highlighted that the department will not use indictments to develop laws. “We should not leave innovators uncertain about what could result in criminal charges,” he added.

ChatGPT Issues a Stark XRP Warning,https://cryptopotato.com/up-or-down-for-ripples-price-in-the-week-ahead-chatgpt-issues-a-stark-xrp-warning/,"The cryptocurrency market was crushed in the past week or so, and Ripple’s native token is no exception. Even if we remove the black swan flash crash that took it below $1 on some exchanges last Friday, the asset’s price performance has been quite painful and is about to close the week with another double-digit decline. However, there might be even more pain on the horizon, at least according to ChatGPT. What’s Next for XRP? XRP has come a long way from the mid-summer rally when it exploded from $2.20 to $3.65 to register a new all-time high. Since then, it’s declined by nearly 40% and has dropped by two spots in the ranking of the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. ChatGPT outlined the predominantly negative sentiment in the cryptocurrency community, as its leader remains “dominant and volatile,” while other alts, like ETH and BNB, have coped better than XRP. In fact, it said Ripple’s token is “lagging hard,” which suggests “a rotation away from slower-moving assets.” Consequently, its prediction for the week is not favorable to the XRP Army. It outlined the first strong resistance levels, at $2.20 and $2.10, which could prevent a potential drop to $2, even though some analysts believe XRP “wants” to go there. If it indeed slips to that line, it should face a stronger support, which was formed in the spring of 2025. In case of an unlikely price reversal, XRP’s first resistance targets lie at $2.40-$2.50, followed by a bigger hurdle at $2.80. Bears Still Hold on Tight After a 19% weekly decline and a 24% monthly drop, it isn’t easy to be bullish. Consequently, ChatGPT put the highest chances for a bearish continuation in the week ahead (45%-50% probability). It broached the aforementioned support levels, and said XRP must maintain $2.00 to avoid another possible nosedive to $1.60. Although it asserted that the bears are most likely to remain in control, it also outlined the possibility of a tactical rebound following such a massive correction. According to the AI chatbot, there’s a 35% probability for such a bounce to somewhere around $2.50 and $2.60. Interestingly, it believes the chances for a price stabilization at these levels (between $2.10 and $2.40) are the slimmest. With a 15% to 20% probability, ChatGPT ranked this as the least likely option for the next seven days. “The momentum and sentiment both lean bearish, but the setup looks technically oversold. Base case: mild continuation lower early in the week, followed by potential stabilization near $2.00. Unless Ripple announces a major development (e.g., RLUSD expansion, new exchange partnership, or institutional pilot), a strong recovery next week is unlikely,” it concluded.

The memecoin reaches a crucial point when technical indicators suggest that a significant price movement can follow the accumulation. Price Structure Shows Resilience Despite Pullback DOGE is now at a lower price, below 0.382 Fibonacci retracement difference at 0.215, which can be considered the first level of resistance to the new bullish price movement. The coin has defended the support zone of $0.151 on multiple occasions in 2025, making this support zone a dependable floor for the price action. Fibonacci retracement. Source: X The 9.7% drop this week has failed to end the higher-low trend that has defined the present market formation. The price is higher than the previous cycle lows, which is a confidence boost for long-term holders. Analyst Cantonese Cat stresses the need to recover the threshold of $0.215. Bulls would be back in control when a weekly close over this resistance is reached and would be likely to initiate a push towards the next Fibonacci extensions of $0.27 and $0.31. Source: X The battlefield of DOGE has been shifted to the range of $0.151 and 0.215. Any breach of support would be welcome to more profound combinations, and a consistent trend above resistance will provide opportunities for higher valuations. Trade activity has been shrinking, especially since the mid-2025 peak. The trends in volume indicate that participation is also decreasing, and there is little new capital flowing into the market. This is usually an indication of consolidation, rather than distribution. The low volume has not been historic, so one may not want to assume it is strictly bearish. Past rallies of Dogecoin in 2023 and 2024 were the result of such periods of silence. The explosive moves were usually preceded by long periods of inactivity, which made the traders unprepared when they encountered the reality of buying pressure. The recent decline to $0.17 was met with an immediate purchasing action, indicating active support at the important technical levels. This pattern is a recreation of recovery trends in the success reversals of 2024. The short-term weakness is not neutralised because there are no lower lows to spoil the medium-term outlook. Broader Market Context Influences DOGE Performance The slow performance of Dogecoin is indicative of the sluggish marketplace for altcoins. Bitcoin dominance is elevated because investors are preferring more traditional investments due to distrust of macro conditions. The tightening of the global money system and reduced liquidity have suppressed risk appetite in cryptocurrency markets. On-chain measures tell a different story. User interest remains very strong, indicating that it persists despite a price stagnation. It is generally price action divergence and network activity divergence that are characteristic of accumulation zones, rather than distribution events. DOGE remains a high-beta asset, which predisposes the company to greater volatility as soon as the market situation improves. As a hypothetical asset with high levels of community support, Dogecoin has historically performed disproportionately well as liquidity returns to the cryptocurrency market. The technical foundation remains constructive. Higher lows continue to form while critical support remains firm. This structure provides the framework for potential upside once catalysts emerge. Traders now watch for volume confirmation and a break above $0.215, which would validate the next leg higher.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|DOGE|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-19 06:14:17
