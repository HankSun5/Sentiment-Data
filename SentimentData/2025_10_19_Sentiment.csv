The funding round was led by prominent venture capitalist firms Greenoaks and Joshua Kushner’s Thrive Capital, representing the growing footprint of cryptocurrency in mainstream finance and global capital markets. Tempo’s Valuation Climbs To $5B After Funding Round In a new post on Friday, Fortune reports that Stripe’s Tempo has recorded a successful Series A funding, pushing the blockchain’s valuation to $5 billion. In early September, Stripe announced Tempo in partnership with crypto VC Paradigm as a layer-1 blockchain designed to enable stablecoin payment and boost payment efficiency. In Paradigm’s announcement statement , the firm’s co-founder and managing director, Matt Huang, gave valuable insights on Tempo’s mission, saying: We are excited to further crypto’s ability to tackle real-world use cases, including global payments and payroll, remittances, tokenized deposits for 24/7 settlement, embedded financial accounts, microtransactions, agentic payments, and more. Tempo joins a list of growing stablecoin-focused layer 1 blockchains, including Circle’s Arc and Tether’s Plasma. Interestingly, its launch also comes following the adoption of a pro-crypto policy by US President Donald Trump, leading to several positive regulatory developments. In July, President Trump notably signed the GENIUS Act, establishing a federally approved framework to regulate the issuance and operation of stablecoins in the United States. Tempo represents Stripe’s bet on dollar-backed stablecoin’s potential to emerge as a key player in the global payment system. The blockchain project is jointly designed with global industry leaders, including Deutsche Bank, OpenAI, Standard Chartered, and Revolut, among others. Meanwhile, alongside Greenoaks and Thrive Capital, other participants in this funding round included Ribbit Capital, Sequoia, and Ron Conway’s SC Angel. Notably, Paradigm and Stripe made no equity contribution to this round. Stripe Presses On With Crypto Ambitions Beyond its investment in Tempo, Stripe’s expansion into crypto has accelerated in 2025. In February, the billion-dollar company acquired stablecoin startup Bridge for $1.1 billion, followed by a June deal to purchase crypto wallet company Privy. With Tempo, the payment company looks to gain a stronghold in the booming stablecoin market. While Stripe has not disclosed plans for a native Tempo token, the company has previously stated plans to remain agnostic. The company’s focus on blockchain payment infrastructure puts it in direct competition with established stablecoin players like Circle and Tether , and major blockchain networks such as Ethereum , Solana, and Tron. At press time, the total stablecoin market cap is $316.52 billion with a daily trading volume of $238 billion.",Crypto News|Layer 1 blockchain|Paradigm|stablecoin|Stripe|Tempo,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|REGULATION|USDT,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-18 19:30:20

Related Reading: Bitcoin Plunges To $105k As Investors Shift To Gold After Crypto Carnage His clip argues that as long as many traders expect quick rebounds and hold long bets, the market can keep sliding until optimism is gone. But, it was the “car crash” and “losing your entire family” and having an arm amputated in an accident part that sounded disturbing. It was all a metaphor about the reality of investing in Bitcoin and that everything could get worse. At least, in the way he sees it. On Psychology & Risk Tate’s message was mostly dark and foreboding. He spoke about pain, suffering and how too much expectation can wreck people’s dreams. His message enters on market psychology: too many people still thinking price won’t go lower, which is the worst part — and that keeps risk alive. He framed the move as a capitulation or “amputation” — a moment when traders finally give up and positions are cleared. Several crypto outlets picked up the clip and reposted short videos of his comments across X and Instagram. Market data gives context to why his warning grabbed attention. Bitcoin recently pulled back from highs earlier in October and traded near the $106,000–$107,000 area on October 17, with large liquidations hitting futures and options desks. BITCOIN IS GOING TO $26,000 pic.twitter.com/Ng8ntmjWow — Andrew Tate (@Cobratate) October 17, 2025 Reports show hundreds of millions cleared from leveraged positions in the recent sell-off. That kind of forced selling can amplify moves in either direction. Market Moves And Data Points Other outlets pointed out outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs on days when prices slid, evidence that institutional flows can swing quickly and affect liquidity. Some coverage named single-day ETF outflows in the hundreds of millions, underscoring how fragile demand can look in a down leg. At the same time, a few market vets argued that these drops create buying chances for longer-term players. Observers split on probability. Some analysts warn that a deep correction is possible if broad liquidity dries up or if macro shocks hit risk assets. Others note that structural change — like larger custody flows and ETF frameworks — creates more buyers than in past cycles, which could make a plunge to $26,000 unlikely without a major external shock. Related Reading: Biggest Shiba Inu Burn In Months — And It Came From A Coinbase Account What Traders Should Watch Meanwhile, key numbers to watch are support near four-figure and five-figure levels that traders have flagged this week, liquidations across futures, and ETF flows in and out of spot products. Momentum indicators versus gold and on-chain metrics have also been highlighted by some outlets as signs of whether sellers are exhausted or just getting started. In short, Tate’s $26,000 call is a bold, simple forecast built on a sentiment argument. It is newsworthy because it came from a widely followed figure and because crypto is volatile right now. But it is one scenario among many.

One DeFi crypto capturing attention is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , currently priced at just $0.035 in Phase 6 of its presale, with over 70% sold out and more than $17.6 million raised. MUTM’s innovative dual-lending DeFi model, which combines Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract liquidity pools, allows users to lend and borrow efficiently within a single ecosystem, providing real-world utility alongside speculative potential. Analysts and early investors suggest that, with its presale momentum and strong community backing, Mutuum Finance could become the next crypto coin to explode, making it a better opportunity for both ETH millionaires and new investors seeking exposure to a high-potential DeFi project. Why Ethereum (ETH) Millionaires Are Changing Their Bets Ethereum (ETH) is trading at below $4,000 currently, which indicates short-term weakness but the bulls are unable to gain control, yet long-term fundamentals are still intact, thus making tactical bets by experienced ETH investors. With immediate resistance at $4,000 and its crucial accumulation zone between $3,000 and $2,600, millionaires are exercising maximum prudence while positioning for the next move, using dips as opportunities to re-accumulate in anticipation of targets higher up towards $8,000–$10,000. This strategy of accumulating reflects a macro strategy of capitalizing on volatility without deviating from Ethereum’s long-term bullish trajectory. As ETH investors branch out and look for alternative high-potential opportunities beyond established networks, attention increasingly is turning to new DeFi crypto initiatives and future-oriented crypto tokens that can be used to enhance legacy positions, and so here is growing interest Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the next crypto coin to explode. Mutuum Finance as the Best Cryptocurrency to Invest in Now Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly turning into a top crypto project within the DeFi space and among the top cryptos to buy for the near and long terms. Its presale already stands at Stage 6 and has so far registered robust adoption among the crypto community with a combined total of 17,300+ investors contributing over $17.6 million. They observed that such growing demand and consistent investor confidence position MUTM as a viable contender, supported by real DeFi crypto use cases and solid growth, making it one of the next crypto coin to explode in the decentralized finance market. Currently, over 70% of Phase 6 has already sold out, signaling accelerating demand as investors rush to secure tokens before the next price jump. Once this phase concludes, the MUTM price will rise by 20%, moving closer to the $0.06 launch value. With each stage offering fewer tokens at higher prices, early buyers are locking in positions ahead of what analysts describe as a strong post-listing upside. Mutuum Finance Leaderboard MUTM is also introducing friendly competition in the presale with its leaderboard in the presale. The top five largest investors in the last 24 hours purchased $1,704, $1,291, $1,000, $734, and $685 MUTM tokens respectively, a gauge of increasing interest and activity at the grassroots level. There is also the $500 MUTM bonus for the number 1 buyer on a day-to-day basis as an incentive feature designed to reward and encourage frequent activity. A member qualifies after making one purchase within the 24-hour window, and thus it is very simple for anyone to join and rise through the ranks. Crypto news today reports have highlighted that such community-based mechanisms are giving MUTM instant exposure as the next cryptocurrency to reach $1 in the DeFi crypto space and a likely next crypto coin to explode in 2025. Mutuum Finance Lending and Borrowing Protocol One of the top altcoins to invest in right now that is further consolidating its hold is Mutuum Finance. It is gearing up to release its most anticipated lending and borrowing protocol . V1 (Version 1) coming out in Q4 2025 that will be rolled out in the Sepolia Testnet will possess all the essential features of a full DeFi system, including liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and liquidator bot. Users will be able to lend, borrow, and collateralize ETH and USDT from the very launch date and enjoy the advantage of possessing a safe, rapid, and scalable decentralized finance platform. As Ethereum millionaires diversify, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being positioned as a high-growth DeFi crypto project. Having already raised over $17.6M from 17,300+ investors and its Phase 6 already 70% sold out, its twin-lending model and impending release of Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 makes it one of the best cryptos to invest in today, and perhaps even the next crypto coin to explode as the market heads into the next bull cycle.

Three names are capturing the attention of investors and analysts alike: Shiba Inu, Aster, and the rapidly rising newcomer Based Eggman . This month’s crypto price analysis reveals that each of these projects offers a distinct value proposition, with Shiba Inu holding steady as a leading memecoin, Aster pushing the boundaries with next-gen smart contracts, and Based Eggman shaking up the sector as a new cryptocurrency with viral potential and real utility. Shiba Inu Price Analysis October 2025: Is the Memecoin Rally Ready? Often topping the list of best crypto price prediction models, Shiba Inu remains a heavyweight in the memecoin space. After a volatile summer, the latest Shiba Inu price analysis October 2025 shows SHIB consolidating above major support at $0.000009706, with whale accumulation on the rise according to on-chain data. For those looking to buy Shiba Inu, analysts suggest that any renewed social momentum or ecosystem update could trigger a short-term rally, though long-term growth may depend on the broader adoption of the ShibaSwap platform and further utility enhancements to the Shiba Inu memecoin. Aster Price Prediction: Smart Contract Growth Fuels Optimism As a new cryptocurrency making waves in the DeFi and Web3 space, Aster has seen impressive adoption over the past year. The current Aster price analysis points to steady upward momentum, with price predictions targeting potential new highs if the project continues to expand its dApp ecosystem and attract developer talent. Aster’s focus on cross-chain compatibility and user-friendly staking positions it as one of the best crypto to buy now for those seeking exposure to cutting-edge blockchain tech. Should the network secure additional partnerships or CEX listings this quarter, bullish scenarios could see Aster breaking previous resistance and establishing itself as a serious contender in the layer-1 race. Based Eggman: Newcomer with Viral Potential and Real Utility Rounding out the top three is Based Eggman , a new entrant that’s quickly gaining attention both as a meme and as a utility-driven project. With a presale price offering accessibility at just $0.0086, Based Eggman is making headlines as a new cryptocurrency that blends the viral appeal of classic memecoins with actual ecosystem integration—such as gaming, social-Fi features, and staking rewards. Unlike many first-generation meme tokens, Based Eggman’s roadmap prioritizes real use cases on the Base blockchain, drawing early interest from both retail and whale investors. For those seeking the best crypto price prediction with high growth potential, $GGs stands out as a speculative but promising play for October 2025. Conclusion: The Best Cryptos to Buy in October 2025 What sets Based Eggman apart—and makes it arguably the best crypto to buy now—is its unique ability to combine the explosive viral energy of traditional memecoins with the tangible, long-term value of a utility token. While Shiba Inu relies heavily on community momentum and Aster’s growth depends on developer adoption, Based Eggman is carving out its own niche by delivering real use cases from day one, including integrated gaming, social-Fi, and staking rewards on the Base blockchain. Its accessible presale price of $0.0086 creates a low barrier to entry with significant upside, and its rapidly expanding community is attracting both seasoned crypto whales and newcomers alike. For investors looking for a project positioned at the intersection of meme culture and genuine ecosystem value, Based Eggman offers a fresh opportunity to capture early gains in a way that both Shiba Inu and Aster, with their larger market caps and slower growth potential, may not match in the months ahead.

Both have rapidly gained recognition as the top memecoins to buy this season, thanks to their unique community-driven narratives, robust growth potential, and ability to capture the imagination of traders searching for the next big win. In this in-depth look, we’ll explore why these projects top the list for those seeking the best crypto to buy in October 2025, and why SPX coin, in particular, could deliver a market-shocking performance. SPX6900 Coin: Viral Momentum and the Next Big Meme Movement SPX6900 coin has quickly emerged as a standout in the memecoin ecosystem, blending irreverent internet culture with a highly engaged online following. The token’s rise has been fueled by a series of viral marketing campaigns, influencer endorsements, and a dedicated meme army, making it a top memecoin for those looking to capitalize on social-driven momentum. According to the most recent SPX6900 price prediction reports, SPX is poised for further rallies, with analysts highlighting its breakout potential as fresh capital flows into the memecoin segment. What sets SPX memecoin apart is its ability to continuously innovate and surprise the market. From gamified community events to bold roadmap updates, SPX is not just another fleeting trend—it’s a movement with staying power. Many investors now consider it the best memecoin to buy for October, betting that its next major announcement or viral moment could trigger a price surge that shocks even seasoned market watchers. Based Eggman ($GGs): Social-Fi Innovation and Early Adoption Advantage While SPX6900 dominates the meme narrative with its shock factor, Based Eggman ($GGs) is quietly building a powerful ecosystem on the Base blockchain—setting it apart as one of the best memecoins to buy for those interested in utility and long-term engagement. $GGs leverages social-Fi incentives, gaming rewards, and a vibrant community to deliver an interactive experience where every holder can participate and benefit. Its presale success and growing user base have cemented Based Eggman’s place among the top memecoins to buy for early adopters looking to maximize future returns. The combination of low transaction fees, rapid development, and community-driven growth makes Based Eggman a memecoin to invest in for anyone seeking more than just hype. As more traders recognize the project’s innovation and its potential to scale, the case for $GGs as the best crypto to buy this October grows stronger. Why These Memecoins Top the List for October 2025 For those assembling a portfolio of the best crypto to buy October 2025, diversification is key. SPX6900 coin offers explosive, meme-fueled upside, while Based Eggman provides a platform for sustained engagement and ecosystem rewards. Both tokens are seeing increased inflows from traders and influencers seeking the next 10x opportunity, and their communities are driving the kind of organic buzz that often precedes massive moves. If you’re looking for the top memecoin or the best memecoin to buy in this cycle, combining the viral potential of SPX6900 with the innovative foundation of Based Eggman could offer the perfect balance of risk and reward. Their complementary strengths highlight why these two tokens are the top memecoins to buy in October 2025.

How Low Will XRP Go?,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-to-xrp-investors-i-told-you-this-would-happen-how-low-will-xrp-go/,"The recent dip in XRP has stirred anxiety across the crypto market, as traders struggle to make sense of a sharp correction that seems to have caught many off guard. Yet, according to prominent market analyst Austin Hilton, this was not an unpredictable event—it was the outcome of geopolitical tensions that have been brewing for weeks. As Hilton put it, “This is something that I did tell you would play out, and how it will play out is exactly how it’s going.” The Global Shock The U.S.–China trade war has once again rippled through global markets, affecting stocks, commodities, and digital assets alike. The latest escalation centers on rare earth minerals, essential components in high-tech manufacturing and renewable energy technologies. China currently controls about 44% of global rare earth reserves, while the U.S. holds just 1.9%, making Washington’s recent tariff hikes a high-stakes move. I told you this would happen with XRP! How low will XRP go? pic.twitter.com/2f5N3vwncg — Austin Hilton (@austinahilton) October 17, 2025 Last week, President Donald Trump announced 100% tariffs on Chinese imports, which Hilton described as a “nuclear bomb” for the global economy. The ripple effect was immediate—markets across the world trembled, and XRP wasn’t spared . Hilton explained, “This continues to be the fallout from the United States versus China trade war… it was initially about rare earth minerals, and that’s a big deal to everybody in the world.” XRP’s Reaction: Volatility Returns As the market digested the news, XRP briefly wicked down to $1.25 before recovering above the $2 mark. As of report time, the token trades around $2.34, according to CoinMarketCap , reflecting ongoing volatility as traders weigh macroeconomic uncertainty. Hilton believes the reaction is not unique to XRP but part of a wider risk-off sentiment affecting the entire crypto market. “You look out there—Dogecoin down ten percent, Tron down, Cardano down nine, that’s what’s playing out right now,” he noted. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Despite the turbulence, Hilton advised calm and discipline. “Do I want XRP to go below $2? Hell no. I own both of those [Bitcoin and XRP],” he said. “But this is simply not going to end tomorrow… these are complicated multi-trillion-dollar problems we’re dealing with here.” How Low Will XRP Go? Hilton’s short-term outlook suggests that XRP could still dip further before stabilizing . He reiterated that “we’ll probably see XRP go below $2,” attributing the move to the continued fallout from tariff uncertainty rather than any failure in Ripple’s fundamentals or network performance. Technical analysts point to $1.80 as a key support level; if the price falls below that, the next psychological floor lies near $1.50. However, many long-term holders view such dips as buying opportunities amid broader adoption trends and Ripple’s expanding financial partnerships. Hilton’s Message: Don’t Panic, Keep Perspective Hilton closed his message on a reassuring note, urging XRP investors to zoom out from the noise. “Crypto is not gonna wither and die—it may feel like that when you are in the middle of it day-to-day. Get away from it. Go touch grass, walk your dog, spend time with family. This is where we’re at now, guys. This is reality.” While short-term volatility may test investors’ patience, Hilton’s broader point resonates: macroeconomic shocks often shake out weak hands before paving the way for stronger rebounds. With the U.S.–China trade war still evolving, XRP’s path may remain rocky—but for those with long-term conviction, this downturn could be the calm before another historic rally.

According to the post, a group likely controlled by a single individual or organization is using numerous addresses to withdraw BNB from Binance. These addresses are processing thousands of high-frequency transactions for dozens of different tokens daily. Over the past 30 days, each address has reportedly traded over 250 different tokens, processing hundreds of thousands of transactions. Related News: Founder of This Altcoin Bought a Significant Amount of His Own Token: The Price Chart Turned Green The Data Nerd argued that activity on this scale exhibits a pattern more typical of automated trading bots than individual investors or project teams. It was also noted that these addresses had recently traded COAI tokens, but generally did not “buy the dip” and instead operated in a continuous buy-sell cycle. This behavior was likened to the trading strategies of arbitrage or mining bots rather than memecoin insiders. *This is not investment advice.

The founder added that 50% of the token supply will be given to OG users while sharing minimal tokenomics details. OpenSea is transforming into a full trading platform that will include both fungible and non-fungible tokens. “This is just the beginning of our transformation, from ‘NFT marketplace’ to ‘trade everything,'” said Finzer on X. He further added that the wave of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in 2021 was just the first chapter in OpenSea’s journey, which brought a ton of artists, musicians, gamers, and collectors on-chain. OpenSea to reward OG users Finzer said that 50% of SEA tokens will be given to the platform’s supporters, mainly OG users and participants in the ongoing rewards program. In the joint announcement with the OpenSea Foundation , Finzer explained, “The Foundation has confirmed that 50% of supply will be allocated to the community, with more than half awarded via an initial claim. Both OGs and those who participated in OpenSea rewards programs will be meaningfully considered, separately.” Moreover, half of the revenue collected during SEA’s launch will be used for token buyback. The SEA token will power the newly transformed OpenSea platform. Users can stake SEA to support their favorite token or NFT collectibles. The OpenSea Foundation has been teasing the SEA token since February. However, OpenSea did not disclose more details about the token, such as the total supply and other tokenomics details.

Currently, it charges 0.9% fees on every transaction, ensuring a steady stream of revenue. NFTs are still a big part of OpenSea, used for airdrops and other perks. Additionally, OpenSea wants to tap the perpetual futures contracts known as perps. The platform wants to mimic successful perp DEXs like Hyperliquid and Aster, hoping to secure a share in this market.

The event caused widespread liquidations across the derivatives market and rattled trader confidence, leaving market sentiment deeply shaken. On-chain data from CryptoQuant shows that Bitcoin’s open interest variation fell to negative 25 in the aftermath of the flash crash, its lowest reading in 2025. This decline highlights a market that has been cleansed of excessive leverage, but the question is whether this points to a major rebound or the start of a deeper correction. Bitcoin Open Interest Sinks Into Extreme Fear Territory According to on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, Bitcoin’s open interest variation , an indicator measuring changes in the total number of active futures contracts, recently entered the Extreme Fear zone. Particularly, the open interest reached a low of around negative 25 points, its lowest level so far in 2025. This metric had previously reached similar lows during BTC’s last major correction earlier in the year, when it dropped to around negative 25. However, the last time the Bitcoin open interest dropped below this negative 25 level was in mid-2023. The latest reading around negative 25 shows the intense market capitulation , where over-leveraged traders were flushed out when BTC touched $101,000. Similar drops so far this year have shown moments of extreme pessimism but were followed by renewed strength once the selling pressure subsided. Each time open interest collapsed to this degree, Bitcoin’s price found support soon after and began a steady recovery in the following weeks. This recurring pattern suggests that extreme deleveraging often precedes the formation of local or macro bottoms. What Does This Mean For Bitcoin? If the crash in open interest follows a price drop, it often indicates a wave of long liquidations. This type of extremely low open interest means that most leverage traders has been fully flushed from the system, and the market is now cleaner. In such cases, it can actually be bullish in the medium and long terms. As shown in the chart above, the last time open interest fell to negative 25 was in early April, when BTC finally ended its extended correction from above $106,000 at $76,300. What happened after was months of uptrends that finally saw Bitcoin break above $106,000 again and into new all-time highs. A similar performance and comparable rebound would project BTC’s price to undergo a steady 40% to 50% increase over the next multiple months. This steady increase would send Bitcoin price action back above $150,000 by early 2026. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $106,900, up by 1.4% in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Bitcoin's Open Interest|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|CryptoQuant,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-18 21:00:26

More shockingly, on-chain data has surfaced that paints a pessimistic yet uncertain picture of the cryptocurrency’s future. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Falls To $103,000: Is This The End Of The Bull Run Or A Prequel To The Next Surge? $100,000 Emerges As Key Support Zone In a recent X post on Friday, CryptoQuant analyst Julio Moreno shared insights from his technical analysis of the Bitcoin price action. Moreno highlighted that Bitcoin’s most recent break beneath what was a price consolidation range of $120,000-$108,000 has caused a shift of attention towards $100,000 as the next critical level. The crypto analyst defended his report with the Bitcoin Trader On-chain Realized Price Bands metric, which measures the lower boundary of the average on-chain acquisition cost for Bitcoin short-term holders. Simply, this metric helps identify the price level that would act as support in cases where the price experiences corrective movement. From the chart shared above, $100.9k is currently the lower boundary of the average trader realized price, one that Moreno expects could serve as a support zone. Aside from technical analysis and on-chain activity, $100,000 is also a significant psychological price level, as it serves as the hallmark where Bitcoin enters a six-figure valuation. If the Bitcoin price were to fall to levels as low as $100,000, the strong psychological backing by market participants could translate to its price action. As a result, the flagship cryptocurrency could see temporary relief from the bearish pressure that it is currently under. Related Reading: Solana Meme Economy: The Culture That Drives Billions In Volume – Here’s How What Next For Bitcoin? As was previously mentioned, $100,000 stands as a significant level for the Bitcoin price, with psychology and technical analysis coming together to reinforce its importance. Derivable from Moreno’s post is the conjecture that if the $100,000 support were to hold, Bitcoin’s bullish sentiment among market participants could be renewed, thus setting the pace for the flagship cryptocurrency’s recovery towards its current all-time-high price. On the other hand, the failure of this important price level could carry grave implications, especially for short-term holders. A break in this psychological support could trigger a sharp sentiment shift amongst Bitcoin market participants, causing them to sell their holdings to minimize losses or escape with some profits. Interestingly, the 365-day Moving Average (MA) sits around the $100,000 psychological support. For context, the 365-day MA is a technical indicator that shows Bitcoin’s average closing price over the past year. By extension of its primary function, the indicator is used to gauge Bitcoin’s direction in the long term. If Bitcoin should therefore slip beneath its 365-day MA of $100,000, it could be a sign that the digital asset is about to assume a long-term bearish trajectory, a sign which might precede major price corrections. As of this writing, Bitcoin is worth approximately $107,400, showing a 7-day loss of more than 5% of its value.

While the dip spooked some short-term holders, seasoned investors see it as a buying opportunity, not a red flag. The surge in trading volume by over 34% suggests that smart money is accumulating again, anticipating a bounce toward the $200–$250 zone. But what’s truly sparking excitement isn’t just Solana’s price recovery; it’s the emerging rotation into undervalued altcoins showing early-stage momentum. Among these, MAGACOIN FINANCE is fast becoming the FOMO-driven pick of the season, attracting investors looking for outsized returns and early entry into what some analysts call a potential 100x opportunity heading into 2025. Solana Price Prediction — Testing the $175 Support Zone The recent market dip has caught several investors and traders off guard as SOL tested the $175 support level. Despite the dip, Solana’s trading volume has demonstrated resilience as it surged by 34.35% with 12.07B in the last 24 hours. Solana Price Chart: CoinGecko Solana recently re-entered the descending channel pattern, but the bears halted the relief rally at the 20-day EMA ($210) on Tuesday. The $190 level is the near-term support to watch out for. If the price continues lower and breaks below $190, it signals that the bears are in control. The Solana price could then tumble to $168. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns up and breaks above the moving averages, it suggests that the bulls are back in the driver’s seat. The SOL/USDT pair could rally to $238 and later to $260. The Hidden 100x ROI Altcoin Investors Are Watching As Solana fights to recover from its $180 breakdown, early investors are quietly stacking MAGACOIN FINANCE for 100x potential . Investment professionals are referring to it as a next-gen altcoin that has all the makings of transparency, community, and sustainable tokenomics. These are the features that early investors look out for before a breakout occurs. Early traction of the project is developing fast due to growing demand among early buyers and MAGACOIN FINANCE is being tipped as one of the best crypto to buy for investors targeting significant returns. It is currently undervalued at less than $1, and analysts believe that the token will see substantial returns in the near future. Conclusion Solana’s drop below $180 may prove to be one of 2025’s most talked-about buying zones if the rebound continues. But the real story shaping up is the growing investor migration toward undervalued gems like MAGACOIN FINANCE. MAGACOIN FINANCE has been fully audited and verified by Hashex , confirming its smart-contract integrity and investor protection. Analysts note that few presales offer this level of transparent, certified security backed by Certik review. As the market prepares for another bullish cycle, the narrative of price recovery meets early opportunity is fueling urgency across trading circles. For those watching from the sidelines, the combination of SOL’s rebound potential and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s 100x speculation could mark the beginning of a new wave of crypto momentum, and missing the entry might just be the biggest risk of all.

While price action may appear muted, technical indicators suggest that a significant move could be developing. History has shown that XRP’s major rallies often begin when sentiment is at its lowest—precisely the kind of environment traders are witnessing today. Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto has once again drawn attention to XRP’s long-term technical picture, arguing that the charts are revealing a massive opportunity few are seeing. His latest analysis, shared on X, merges Elliott Wave Theory with the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Ribbon on the monthly chart—two tools that have historically pinpointed the start of explosive XRP uptrends. Wave 4 Consolidation: The Calm Before the Next Impulse According to Egrag, XRP is currently completing its Wave 4 correction, a common pause following the powerful Wave 3 advance. In Elliott Wave Theory, Wave 4 typically retraces about 23.6% to 38.2% of Wave 3, representing a consolidation phase before the next major surge—Wave 5. Egrag’s calculations show that Wave 3 extended from around $1.40 to $3.65, and by applying a 1.618 Fibonacci extension, the projected Wave 5 target lands near $7.29. This aligns with the broader $7–$8 target zone, which Egrag describes as consistent with a “macro secular bullish count.” In this framework, XRP’s current cycle would mark only the beginning of a much larger, long-term trend. #XRP – EMA Ribbon Massive Indication: ($8 – $20 – $27) : Trust In TA: I know many of you cannot see it but TA and Numbers is stating it bluntly.

I’ve… pic.twitter.com/zldKRMx6up — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) October 18, 2025 The EMA Ribbon: Historical Indicator of Parabolic Moves Beyond the wave structure, Egrag highlights the EMA Ribbon on XRP’s monthly chart as a key signal for timing major moves. The EMA Ribbon, a cluster of exponential moving averages, acts as a dynamic zone of support and resistance. Historically, every major XRP rally—such as those seen in 2017 and 2021—began shortly after the price dipped into the EMA Ribbon. Egrag points out that XRP has recently touched this region once again, suggesting the setup for another upward expansion. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 By comparing previous cycles, he identifies potential measured move targets: Around $8 , if the 2021 pattern repeats. Around $27, if the 2017 cycle mirrors again . The average between these two is approximately $20, forming what Egrag calls the “macro target band.” Market Sentiment and Trader Psychology Egrag also acknowledges the growing anxiety within the XRP community. He notes that his inbox has been flooded with messages from traders worried about the recent dip. Yet, he emphasizes that such emotions are typical during Wave 4 corrections, which often mislead traders into premature selling before the next bullish phase begins. His message is clear: trust the technicals, not the fear. Historically, when traders capitulated near the EMA Ribbon, those moments turned out to be prime accumulation opportunities. The Broader Outlook As of mid-October 2025, XRP trades near the $2 mark, well below the targets suggested by the Elliott Wave and EMA Ribbon models. Still, technical confidence among analysts like Egrag reflects a broader belief that XRP remains structurally bullish. If the Wave 5 scenario unfolds as projected, XRP could be gearing toward one of its most significant price expansions since 2017. However, traders should remain mindful of macroeconomic conditions and manage risk accordingly—because while technicals provide probabilities, not certainties, the alignment of XRP’s EMA and wave structure may be signaling a pivotal moment ahead.

The platform has allocated over $644.64 million in revenue to repurchase its HYPE tokens through its Assistance Fund, which represents 46% of all token buyback spending this year. In fact, Hyperliquid’s buyback efforts are equivalent to the combined spending of the next nine largest buybacks. HYPE Buybacks Overshadow Market To date, at least 21.36 million HYPE tokens have been repurchased. This figure accounted for roughly 2.1% of the total supply. Monthly buybacks have averaged $65.50 million, fluctuating from $39.14 million in March to a peak of $110.62 million in August, with an average repurchase price of $30.18 per HYPE. To put this into perspective, LayerZero ranks as the second largest token buyback, having spent $150 million in September to repurchase 5% of its ZRO supply, with an average price of $3.00. However, this was a one-off discretionary buyback, and CoinGecko expects Hyperliquid’s ongoing program to maintain its dominance. Meanwhile, Pump.fun occupied the third spot as it spent $138.17 million on repurchases since July, averaging $40.47 million per month, and capturing 3% of its total supply. While Pump.fun’s average buyback price of $0.0046 places its repurchased tokens at a paper loss following the October 10 crypto crash, the program demonstrates a strategic approach to supply management. Raydium, the Solana-based DEX, leads in token buyback-and-burn activity after spending $100.35 million since 2022. Other notable projects include Rollbit ($27.93 million), Bonk via Bonk.fun ($27.30 million), Tron’s Sun platform ($3.03 million), and exchange WOO ($1.68 million). Overall, CoinGecko identified 28 projects implementing meaningful buybacks in 2025, amidst a growing trend in the industry as projects explore buybacks as a mechanism to return value to holders and incentivize long-term engagement. Token Buybacks Boom Zooming out, token buybacks have surged to over $1.40 billion so far in 2025. The trend was largely fueled by Hyperliquid. On average, crypto projects have spent roughly $146 million per month repurchasing their tokens this year. A significant spike in September’s figures was linked to LayerZero’s one-off $150 million repurchase, though CoinGecko clarified that this announcement likely distorted month-to-month comparisons. Excluding that, September’s total buyback spending stood at $168.45 million. Interestingly, the pace of buybacks has accelerated in the second half of 2025 as spending saw a jump of 85% month-on-month in July. As of mid-October, projects have already spent almost $89 million, putting the month on course to log a fourth straight period above the first-half average of over $99 million.

Ripple already holds a substantial amount of XRP, with the company’s market report revealing it has 4.5 billion XRP tokens, and another 37 billion tokens locked in escrow. Ripple Labs To Lead $1 Billion Fundraise Ripple Labs is reportedly launching a fundraising effort to purchase $1 billion worth of its XRP tokens, to be held in a digital asset treasury, according to a report by Bloomberg. The company is organizing the fundraiser through a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC. The new digital asset treasury will consist of freshly purchased XRP tokens. Additionally, Ripple Labs will also add to the stash from its own XRP stockpile. However, the exact terms of the transaction are still being discussed and could change before the deal is signed. “JUST IN: RIPPLE LABS TO LEAD $1B FUNDRAISE VIA SPAC TO ACCUMULATE XRP FOR NEW DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY.” Big Market Moves Ripple Labs also announced the purchase of GTreasury, a Chicago-based corporate treasury management firm, for $1 billion, making it the company’s third major acquisition of 2025. According to sources, the deal will give Ripple Labs the tools to manage digital assets held in corporate treasuries. Assets include stablecoins and tokenized deposits that can generate yield for clients. GTreasury’s treasury management software will work with Ripple’s blockchain infrastructure, allowing funds to be accessed around the clock, providing near-instant settlement for cross-border transactions. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse stated that the acquisition addresses problems with slow payment systems, adding that money has been stuck in outdated infrastructure, which causes delays and high costs. The purchase comes after Ripple acquired Hidden Road, a prime brokerage firm, in 2025. It also acquired stablecoin platform Rail during the same period. Ripple Could Become The Largest XRP Treasury Ripple Labs currently holds over 4,5 billion XRP out of a total supply of 59 billion XRP. If the company moves forward with the treasury plan and executes its $ billion buy, it will scoop up an additional 427 million XRP. The company also has an additional 37 billion tokens locked in escrow. Tokens from the escrow are released monthly, with some being sold and others being returned to escrow. Currently, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) lead the crypto treasury race. Institutional investors hold $152 billion in BTC and $23 billion in ETH. XRP has not seen as enthusiastic a response. However, several firms plan to establish an XRP reserve. Trident Digital Tech Holdings, a Web3 company based in Singapore, plans to establish an XRP treasury of up to $500 million. Meanwhile, Chinese AI company Webus plans to allocate $300 million towards an XRP treasury while VivoPower plans to accumulate $100 million worth of XRP tokens.

Safe haven bets clearly favored gold as the asset’s market cap surged to a record $30 trillion, up 18% over the past month. Some analysts believe BTC’s bull run could be over, warning that it risks a 50% correction. Bitcoin ETFs Shed Over $1 Billion Spot Bitcoin ETFs shed over $1.2 billion this week as Bitcoin plunged to multi-month lows. The eleven US spot Bitcoin ETFs registered an aggregate outflow of $366 million on Friday, rounding off a bearish week for the asset and its associated investment products. BlackRock’s IBIT registered the largest outflows with $268.6 million, followed by Fidelity, which lost $67.2 million. Grayscale’s GBTC registered outflows of $25 million, while Valkyrie’s ETF registered minor outflows. Friday’s outflows brought the total outflows for the week to $1.22 billion. The outflows came as Bitcoin shed over $10,000 to slip below $104,000 on Friday before rebounding to current levels. Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX Group, stated, “We see the current slump as largely the aftershock of last weekend's historic liquidation event, compounded by broader market uncertainty and some disappointment around October's underwhelming performance. That said, the fundamental outlook remains intact — the crypto market structure looks constructive, and we expect pullbacks to be met with strong support.” Liquidations registered another spike over the past 24 hours, with data from CoinGlass revealing $1.23 billion was liquidated from the market. Bitcoin Bull Run On Its Last Legs Analyst CryptoBird believes Bitcoin only has a few days of price expansion left if it follows historical patterns from previous bull runs. The analyst stated in a post on X, “Bull run ends in 10 days. Cycle Peak Countdown says BTC is 99.3% done (1,058 days in) as we shake out weak hands in classic pre-peak pattern. Are we in a bear market or is there more upside?” The analyst stated that the Cycle Peak Countdown shows that Bitcoin is 99% done with its upside. “1,058 days since cycle low = 99.3% complete, with only 0.7% remains of this historic bull cycle. Our October 24 target is exactly 10 days away.” According to CryptoBird, the ongoing pullback is right on schedule, adding that it is “classic pre-peak behavior.” Additionally, BTC’s drop below key support levels has led to structural weaknesses, potentially leading to a deeper correction. Analyst Daan Crypto Trades stated in a post on X, “ BTC is losing its Daily 200MA & EMA for the first time since April. With that, also the local support level at ~$107K is lost. Now testing the .786 fibonacci retracement level from this move up, and also when measuring from the wick on other exchanges. The Coinbase pair didn't go as low. Lose this zone and the June lows are on the board. This was the main region I've been waiting for so let's see what we get. Touching grass if bulls can't manage to hold this level this week.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) plunged to an intraday low of $103,516 on Friday, dropping to a multi-month low as selling pressure intensified. The flagship cryptocurrency has rebounded during the ongoing session, trading around $106,774. While prices are stressed, Strike CEO Jack Mallers believes Bitcoin could benefit from any liquidity crisis that follows if regional banks continue to face renewed stress. Mallers sees the banking stress as validation that BTC is pricing in an impending liquidity crisis, and that the Federal Reserve’s response will ultimately drive prices higher. Mallers stated, “Bitcoin is accurately smelling trouble right now. The US is going to have to inject some of that sweet, sweet liquidity soon and print a ton of money, or else its fiat empire goes kaboom. Bitcoin is the most sensitive to liquidity. It moves first. It’s a truth machine. Yields are puking, spreads are blowing out, and banks are stressed. Bitcoin is working. It smells of trouble. When they’re forced to print, it’ll move first again, and outperform everything.” The banking crisis is a repeat of the 2023 regional banking crisis. Analysts believe that the crisis was never truly resolved, but only papered over with bailouts and acquisitions. Some traders and analysts warned of a potential drop below the key $100,000 level, with prices potentially falling to $98,000 if this support was breached. Meanwhile, others saw an attempt to fill a daily candle wick from last week that took prices down to $102,000 on Binance. BTC failed to stay above key levels in its latest downturn, with analysts warning there is almost no support until the $101,000 level. Crypto investor Ted Pillows stated, “ BTC has lost the $108,000 support level. Now there’s little to no support until $101,000-$102,000. If Bitcoin manages to reclaim the $110,000 level from here, we could see a bounce back. Otherwise, expect more pain before relief.” BTC and the crypto market crashed on Friday after President Trump announced 100% tariffs on Chinese goods and new export controls for software. The announcement was made in retaliation for China's imposition of restrictions on rare earth mineral exports. As a result, BTC plunged to $102,000 on Binance before recovering and settling at $112,980. Selling pressure persisted on Saturday as the price fell almost 2% to $110,768. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, markets recovered on Sunday. As a result, BTC rose nearly 4% to reclaim $115,000 and settle at $115,067. Source: TradingView The price faced selling pressure and volatility on Monday, ultimately registering a marginal increase and settling at $115,274. Selling pressure returned on Tuesday as BTC fell to an intraday low of $109,945. It recovered from this level to reclaim $113,000 and settle at $113,068, ultimately dropping 1.91%. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as the price fell 2% to $110,804. Bearish sentiment persisted on Thursday as BTC fell below $110,000 and settled at $108,198. The price plunged to a low of $103,516 on Friday as selling pressure intensified. However, it recovered from this level to settle at $106,463, ultimately dropping 1.60%.

Amid this market, investors are seeking emerging opportunities highlighted in the latest crypto news, projects with strong fundamentals and early-stage growth potential. One cryptocurrency to buy now gaining significant attention is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , currently priced at $0.035 in Phase 6 of its presale, with over 70% sold out and more than $17.6 million raised. Its innovative dual-lending DeFi model, combining Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract liquidity pools, allows users to lend and borrow efficiently while maximizing capital use, giving Mutuum Finance both utility and upside potential. Analysts suggest that, with strong presale momentum and growing community backing, Mutuum Finance is positioning itself as a cryptocurrency to buy now with the potential to explode in value, offering investors an attractive alternative while ETH navigates resistance zones. Ethereum Price Prediction: Key Resistance Levels May Halt ETH’s Upward Rally To $5,000 Ethereum (ETH) currently trades at $4,147, and the key resistance at $4,222 lies in front of it as long-term investors keep selling, which may frustrate its rally to the $5,000 level. On-chain indicators tell of a Holder Accumulation Ratio of only 30%, far from the usual 50% level indicating firm investor belief, and subsequent spikes in “Age Consumed” that affirm continued distribution by long-term investors. If ETH can overcome $4,222 with strong buying pressure, it potentially has a target of $4,956–$5,000, while a failure to break this level could have the price correct lower to $3,872 or below. Amidst all this cautious market sentiment, investors are seeking to diversify into emerging opportunities with early-stage growth potential, with the spotlight fixed on Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is attracting increasing notice with expectations of the next market cycle. Presale Mania for Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is trending the market of crypto news with investors. Investor demand is piling up for its Phase 6 presale.

With additional investors going out and exploring high-potential crypto coins, Mutuum Finance is becoming increasingly the best altcoin to invest in October, especially for those seeking long-term value and real DeFi utility. This growing buzz has made it a frequent feature in crypto news, where analysts continue to point to MUTM as a strong cryptocurrency to buy now ahead of the next market breakout. The reality that a lot more than 70% of Phase 6 tokens have sold already is the token’s popularity and confidence of early adopters before the impending price boom. This quarter is also when the upcoming release of the Mutuum Finance lending and borrowing protocol will be the focus of the project’s roadmap updates. V1 release in Q4 2025 on Sepolia Testnet will introduce the future release of core DeFi infrastructure pieces, i.e., liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and liquidator bot.

This dramatic move came as officials in the Netherlands said they were worried about technology leaking to Wingtech, the Chinese firm that owns 100% of Nexperia. According to Reuters, Nexperia’s China unit went public on October 18 through a statement on its official WeChat account, saying it operates independently and strictly follows Chinese laws. The post added that workers at Nexperia China are only bound to take orders from within the China team. “All employees have the right to reject any external instructions that are not approved by the Chinese legal representative,” the company said. It also clarified that salaries and bonuses would continue to be paid by Nexperia China alone, not by the Dutch unit. China blocks chip exports as supply concerns grow Tensions escalated further on October 4, when China’s commerce ministry banned Nexperia from exporting chips out of the country. That instantly triggered concerns across the global auto and electronics sectors, where these low-end but essential chips are used in large volumes. While Nexperia’s biggest manufacturing plant sits in Hamburg, more than 70% of its chips are still shipped back to Dongguan in Guangdong province for packaging. The threat to chip supply spooked major European automakers . Both Volkswagen and BMW said they were actively checking their supply chains for any possible hit. So far, no production lines in Europe have been shut down. But things are getting tighter elsewhere. In Washington, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation warned that the standoff between the Netherlands and China could have global ripple effects. John Bozzella, who heads the group representing nearly every major carmaker in the United States, including General Motors, Toyota, Ford, Hyundai, and even Volkswagen, said the fallout could get real, fast. “If the shipment of automotive chips doesn’t resume – quickly – it’s going to disrupt auto production in the U.S. and many other countries and have a spillover effect in other industries,” John said on Thursday. Some U.S. automakers told Reuters that their factories might start feeling the pain as early as next month, though they kept quiet publicly due to how delicate the situation is. The worry is simple: Nexperia’s chips may not be fancy, but they’re crucial to making cars and parts in American plants. U.S. pressure triggered the Dutch government’s seizure The decision to take control of Nexperia didn’t happen overnight. It followed months of pressure from Washington. Documents show the Dutch government stepped in before new U.S. rules kicked in that would’ve expanded export controls to any company at least 50% owned by a blacklisted entity. Since Wingtech has full ownership of Nexperia, it was already staring down restrictions. Trump’s administration, which returned to power in 2025, had already listed Wingtech on the U.S. entity list in late December, part of its broader crackdown on Chinese tech access. The Dutch clearly didn’t want to wait for sanctions to hit. So they made the first move, hoping to block any tech handoffs and shield their semiconductor sector from being caught in the middle of a geopolitical brawl. On October 17, the Netherlands said it had opened talks with China to try to dial down the temperature. But the damage has already been done. Nexperia’s ability to move product is frozen. China is refusing outside interference. The U.S. is tightening the screws. And auto plants from Berlin to Detroit are sweating over chip deliveries that may or may not land.

It happened again in March 2023 when regional banks failed and the Fed had to create a new emergency facility just to keep collateral circulating. Each time, the diagnosis is familiar. A sudden shortage of liquidity, collateral or confidence. But those are surface symptoms. The real cause is structural: too few participants, too much concentration and too much dependence on a handful of balance sheets. We call these markets deep, but they are not distributed. They are highly centralized networks pretending to be decentralized ones. The repo market, the Treasury market and the FX market together make up the operating system of global finance, and that system now runs on a few machines. We have built a financial supercomputer with a single cooling fan. It works brilliantly until it does not. The architecture of concentration Start with the repo market. On paper it is vast, roughly 12 trillion dollars in daily outstanding volume. In practice, it is dominated by four or five dealers. Those same firms intermediate most bilateral trades, supply tri-party liquidity and sit between nearly every large buyer and seller of Treasury collateral. When one dealer hesitates, the whole chain stalls. In the bond market, the story is the same. A handful of primary dealers stand between the Treasury and the rest of the world. Market making in Treasuries, once distributed among dozens of firms, is now concentrated in less than ten. The buy side is not any more diverse. Five asset managers control over a quarter of global fixed income assets. The trading venues themselves, from Tradeweb to MarketAxess, have network effects that reinforce the same pattern: a small number of nodes carrying a massive volume of flow. FX looks global, but it follows the same topology. The Bank for International Settlements estimates that the majority of daily FX turnover, roughly 7.5 trillion dollars, passes through fewer than a dozen global dealers. The interdealer market is dense, but the customer market depends almost entirely on those same banks for liquidity. Nonbank liquidity providers have grown, but they connect through the same pipes. In each case, liquidity appears to be a property of the market. In reality, it is a property of dealer balance sheets. When those balance sheets are constrained by regulation, by risk appetite or by fear, liquidity evaporates. We did not build markets as networks. We built them as star systems, a few massive suns with everyone else orbiting their gravity. Centralization as a feature, then a bug This structure was not an accident. It was efficient when computation, trust and capital were expensive. Concentration simplified coordination. A small number of intermediaries made it easier for the Fed to transmit policy, for the Treasury to issue debt and for global investors to access dollar liquidity. For decades, that efficiency looked like stability. But over time, every stress episode revealed the same fragility. The 2019 repo spike happened because balance sheet capacity was maxed out. The 2020 Treasury selloff happened because the biggest dealers could not warehouse risk. Each time, the Fed stepped in, expanding its role, building new facilities and absorbing more of the market’s load. That is not policy drift. It is physics. The logic of centralization compounds itself. When liquidity dries up, everyone runs to the only balance sheet big enough to backstop the system. Each rescue reinforces the dependency. We are now in a regime where the central bank is not just a lender of last resort. It is a dealer of first resort. The Treasury and the Fed together are the two sides of the same balance sheet, one issuing collateral, the other providing leverage against it. The modern financial system has become a state backed utility, not a distributed market. Balance sheet capitalism This is the real definition of our era: balance sheet capitalism. In balance sheet capitalism, markets do not clear through price discovery. They clear through balance sheet capacity. Liquidity is not the flow of buyers and sellers. It is the willingness of a few intermediaries to expand their books. The plumbing of the global dollar system, repo, Treasuries and FX now depends on the same limited nodes. The paradox is that every regulation meant to reduce systemic risk has made this concentration worse. Capital rules, liquidity ratios and clearing mandates all push intermediation into fewer, larger hands. The system is safer in isolation but more correlated in aggregate. When every dollar of liquidity depends on the same two balance sheets, the Fed’s and JPMorgan’s, you no longer have a market. You have a queue. We have financialized trust into a single counterparty. In this world, systemic risk does not come from leverage alone. It comes from architecture. A network that looks decentralized on paper but behaves as a single organism in practice. The more the system grows, the more its stability depends on the political and operational capacity of those core institutions. That is not capitalism. That is infrastructure. Liquidity as code The next evolution of markets will not come from regulation. It will come from computation. When you move markets onchain, you refactor the system. You replace balance sheets with state machines. Onchain markets change three fundamental properties of liquidity: Transparency . Collateral, leverage and exposure are visible in real time. Risk is not a quarterly report. It is a live feed. Programmable trust . Margin, clearing and settlement rules are executed by code, not negotiated by dealers. Counterparty risk becomes deterministic. Permissionless participation . Anyone with capital can provide or consume liquidity. Market access becomes a function of software, not relationships. These properties turn liquidity into something structural, not conditional. It is no longer a function of who is willing to take your trade. It is a property of the network itself. On chain repo markets already exist in prototype form. Tokenized Treasury collateral, automated lending pools and stablecoins acting as cash equivalents. The same mechanics that govern traditional repo, collateral, margin and rollover can be encoded directly into smart contracts. FX swaps, yield curves and derivatives can follow the same logic. The difference is not ideology. It is physics. It is cheaper, faster and safer to compute trust than to regulate it. Onchain markets are what finance looks like when liquidity stops being a privilege and becomes a protocol. The parallel dollar system The first real version of this world is already here. Stablecoins are the onchain descendants of repo collateral, dollar denominated liabilities backed by short term assets. Tokenized Treasuries are the first transparent collateral instruments in financial history. And onchain money markets, from protocol-based lending pools to tokenized reverse repo facilities, are beginning to act as the new funding layer for global capital. Together, these components form a parallel dollar system, one that still references the U.S. Treasury and the Fed but operates with radically different mechanics. In the traditional system, information is private, leverage is opaque and liquidity is reactive. In the onchain system, information is public, leverage is observable and liquidity is programmatic. When stress hits, this transparency changes the entire dynamic. Markets do not have to guess who is solvent. They can see it. Collateral does not disappear into balance sheet black boxes. It can move instantly to where it is needed. The global dollar system is moving, piece by piece, to a public ledger. Tokenized T-bills now exceed two billion dollars in circulation and are growing faster than most traditional money funds. Onchain stablecoin settlement volumes already rival major card networks. And as institutional adoption accelerates, these numbers will compound. This is not a fringe system anymore. It is a mirror system; smaller, faster and more transparent than the one it is quietly replacing. Over time, the line between onchain and offchain will blur. The deepest collateral, the most efficient funding and the most liquid FX will migrate to where transparency and composability are highest. Not because of ideology, but because that is where capital efficiency is greatest. The architecture of trust The dollar system is not going away. It is upgrading. The financial system we built in the twentieth century was centralized because computation was expensive. You needed trust hierarchies, banks, dealers and clearinghouses to coordinate risk and liquidity. The twenty first century system does not need those hierarchies in the same way. Verification is now cheap. Transparency is computational. Coordination can be automated. Central banks will still exist. Treasury markets will still matter. But the architecture will be different. The Fed will not need to be the single cooling fan of the financial supercomputer. It will be one of many nodes in a network that can self-balance. Onchain markets do not eliminate risk. They distribute it. They make it visible, auditable and composable. They turn liquidity into code, trust into infrastructure and systemic risk into a design variable rather than a surprise. For decades, we have been adding complexity to hide fragility, new facilities, new intermediaries and new regulations. The next step is to remove opacity to reveal resilience. What began as a speculative experiment in crypto is evolving into the next monetary infrastructure, an open, programmable foundation for global finance. The transition will not be instant. It will happen gradually, then suddenly, the way all systemic upgrades do. One day, most of the world’s collateral will settle on open ledgers, and nobody will call it crypto anymore. It will just be the market. When that happens, liquidity will stop depending on who owns the biggest balance sheet. It will depend on who runs the best code. And that is how finance will finally evolve from a hierarchy into a network.

According to Bloomberg, the fund is designed to provide traditional investors more access to the crypto market amid a spectacular recovery from the FTX-inspired market crash in November 2022. Related Reading: Ethereum Institutional Accumulation Frenzy: Bitmine Expands Holdings With Another Massive Strategic ETH Buy Hayes PE Fund Targets 6 Company Acquisitions In a post on Friday, Bloomberg reports that Maelstrom, founded by Arthur Hayes and former BitMEX M&A Head Akshat Vaidya, is actively working to raise $250 million for investment in mid-sized crypto firms. The fund, tagged as Maelstrom Equity Fund I, is expected to cover the acquisition of six crypto companies, with each purchase expected to range between $40 million-$75 million. Notably, there will be a strategic focus on blockchain service providers, including trading infrastructure and analytics startups. In a recent X post , Vaidaya, who acts as the managing director, provides more insights into this fund, highlighting the problem and proposed solution. Vaidaya describes the new initiative as the first control-buyout PE fund to focus solely on the crypto ecosystem. The Maelstrom Equity Fund I is to achieve profitability in three main ways. First of which is providing founders of supporting blockchain services to access clean exit opportunities at reasonable valuations. Furthermore, the PE fund would also aim to help new TradFi entrants to the crypto space navigate investment in businesses by providing them access to “an acquisition-ready portfolio of cash-flowing, growing businesses for future buyers of crypto businesses like Robinhood, Charles Schwab, X, Wealthfront, etc.” Finally, Hayes, Vaidaya and newly hired partner Adam Schlegel are also looking to offer capital allocators such as pension funds or other family offices the opportunity to invest capital at scale, e.g, 9 figures+, into the “most fundamentally valuable” sectors of the crypto economy, i.e., the blockchain supporting business, without having to worry about token exposure or market volatility. Maelstrom PE Fund: High Risk Or Not? Interestingly, Bloomberg notes that Maelstrom’s proposed equity fund comes amidst a challenging period as PE firms are globally struggling to attract capital. In the crypto market, PE investment is reportedly down to $1.4 billion, representing a 65% decline from the peak of 2021, which suggests a significant business risk for Hayes and partners. However, a series of high-profile acquisitions amidst a rebounding market since the FTX crash, coupled with the mechanics of the Maelstrom, provides an appealing context for investors. At press time, the total crypto market cap is valued at $3.59 trillion following a 1.06% decline in the last 24 hours.",Crypto News|Adam Schegel|Akshat Vaidya|Arthur Hayes|Bloomberg|maelstrom|private equity,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-18 22:30:03

Analyst Reveals Worst-Case Scenario,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/xrp-price-to-crash-40-analyst-reveals-worst-case-scenario/,"XRP has found itself back under the microscope as bullish momentum is yet to return with full force. Another weekend is here, and XRP’s price action is still perambulating around last weekend’s flash crash, which saw the cryptocurrency register its biggest liquidation candlestick in history. Now, XRP is trying to recover to higher price levels above $2. Interestingly, one technical analysis warns that, before any major rebound, the price of XRP could suffer a severe decline, possibly down as much as 40%. While such a drop would be painful for holders, the scenario is being cast not as a permanent collapse but as a capitulation move that might precede a stronger rally. Related Reading: Biggest Shiba Inu Burn In Months — And It Came From A Coinbase Account Worst Case Scenario What transpired last weekend in the crypto markets qualifies as the largest deleveraging event in recent memory. Leveraged positions were forcibly closed out across many exchanges, leading to cascading liquidations that sent price action into a free fall. As such, about $19 billion in positions was wiped out in the span of hours. In XRP’s case, that intense pressure led to a violent plunge that created a deep low wick to break below $1.6 on its price chart before a quick rebound above $2.2. That wick is central to the argument that the forced selling squeezed both longs and shorts, clearing excess leverage and setting the stage for price discovery to reset. However, a suggestion is that the worst may not yet be fully priced in, and that this purge might continue deeper before sentiment truly turns bullish. This worst-case scenario outlook is based on an analysis by Steph Is Crypto that envisions another possible 40% crash in the XRP price. As shown in the price chart below, XRP’s price action might fall to revisit last weekend flash crash bottom just above $1.55. This price level may represent the deepest downside target before the market catches its footing again. If current levels give way, say if XRP loses its more immediate support zones at $2.2 and $2, the descent toward that boundary would amount to a drop of about 30 to 40%. XRP Price Chart Analysis. Source: Steph Is Crypto on X What’s Next After The Crash? The wick already formed by the sudden flash crash is interpreted as an initial flush of stops, but the full erosion of weak hands might still have room to run. Only after that purge can a more sustainable rebound be believable.

From here, the analyst projected an extended rally that will see the XRP price break into new all-time highs above $3.8. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.35, up by 4% in the past 24 hours.

Ethereum and XRP were among the worst hit, bringing the total crypto market cap down 6% in 24 hours to $3.76 trillion. As momentum fades in larger-cap assets, analysts are shifting focus to smaller, audited projects with quantifiable fundamentals. Among these candidates, MAGACOIN FINANCE has stood out, drawing attention from investors looking for growth opportunities below the $0.01 mark. Ethereum Faces Continued Pressure Ethereum dipped to $3,700 after four consecutive daily losses. The correction has followed heavy selling in derivatives and spot markets. ETF outflows averaged $57 million on Thursday; only BlackRock’s ETHA had inflows of $47 million. Graysale’s ETHE recorded $69 million withdrawals, a reflection of reduced confidence in institutional participation. Source: SoSoValue Technical indicators also favor a bearish trend. The daily indicator chart shows some sell signals, including a downward-sloping MACD and weakening momentum around short-term support areas. If the sell continues, Ethereum could touch its 200-day EMA close to $3,550 with its continuation near the October low of $3,430. Analysts noted that a fresh recovery will need new inflows and stronger on-chain activity to restore buyer confidence. XRP Buyers Lose Confidence Ripple’s XRP is trading below its major support level at $2.22, indicating higher selling pressure. Open Interest (OI) has dipped to an average of $3.81 billion, down from a high in July of $10.94 billion. This decline signifies a diminishing pool of speculative buyers and limited conviction among traders. Source: CoinMarketCap Technical momentum is still weak. The MACD is flashing sell signals again, RSI is in oversold territory, but no clear divergence. Bulls have been unable to recover lost ground, indicating that market participants await new catalysts. Analysts caution that whales are relatively inactive, which means that XRP will face further downside if overall sentiment doesn’t improve. Analysts Turn to MAGACOIN FINANCE As Ethereum and XRP dip, traders are moving to MAGACOIN FINANCE for 75x returns from sub-$0.01 levels. The shift is driven by the growing demand for low-cap projects that offer transparency, certified audits, and sustainable token design. Analysts believe MAGACOIN FINANCE has the fundamentals investors are looking for when major altcoins lose momentum. The Hashex audit reinforced confidence in the project’s smart contract with zero critical or medium-risk findings. Token minting, liquidity, and distribution functions work as they have been designed to. No hidden administrative control is present, so the token supply cannot be manipulated, providing reassurance to long-term holders. Additionally, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s scarcity model adds to the optimism. As the total number of tokens in circulation slowly erodes, organic demand pressure builds. With an infrastructure of verified audits, transparent liquidity tracking, and a growing investor base, these fundamentals offer a realistic path for the 75x compounding gains once broader market sentiment improves. Broader Market View Market analysts observe that capital rotation often follows phases of weakness in leading assets. When Ethereum and XRP lose steam, investors tend to explore smaller, verified ecosystems capable of delivering asymmetric returns. Projects that emphasize accountability and clear token structures are now attracting the majority of early interest. This rotation marks a shift in investor priorities from hype to proof-based participation. Transparency, liquidity control, and community engagement are becoming essential filters for new capital inflows. MAGACOIN FINANCE aligns with these evolving standards, making it a key name in current analyst discussions about potential recovery plays. Conclusion Ethereum and XRP’s latest correction is reshaping investor focus across the market. While large-caps consolidate, interest is gravitating toward smaller, well-audited tokens that demonstrate clear fundamentals and transparent tokenomics. MAGACOIN FINANCE has positioned itself in that space, bridging investor caution with credible long-term potential. Analysts agree that the next bull cycle will reward projects built on transparency and verified data. If MAGACOIN FINANCE maintains its structured ecosystem and community momentum, it could become one of the defining early-stage success stories of the upcoming market rebound.

Here’s What Really Happened",https://timestabloid.com/sell-order-analyst-lists-one-xrp-for-1000-heres-what-really-happened/,"An XRP enthusiast and market analyst, Diep Sanh, has stirred discussion within the XRP community after publicly placing a sell order to exchange 1 XRP for $1,000. Despite the current market downturn, Sanh maintains that at some point in the future, someone will meet that valuation. At the time of his statement, XRP was still trading near $3, making his optimistic price target a symbolic reflection of his long-term belief in the asset. However, since early October, XRP has faced notable price weakness. The token, which was valued at $3.10 on October 2, now trades around $2.35 , representing a 25% decline in just two weeks and marking its lowest point in four months. Sanh’s $1,000 XRP Sell Order Sanh shared a screenshot of his sell order showing his intent to sell 1 XRP for 1,000 USDC. According to him, the order represents his conviction that XRP’s value could one day reach the $1,000 mark , a milestone many analysts consider unrealistic. “One day, someone will pay $1,000 for 1 XRP,” he stated confidently, suggesting that the digital asset’s potential has not yet been fully realized. Placing a sell order. One day, someone will pay $1,000 for 1 XRP pic.twitter.com/Jmd6maXB7e — BD (@DiepSanh) October 6, 2025 His post quickly generated attention within the community, drawing mixed reactions. Supporters praised his confidence, while skeptics questioned the practicality of such a price level given XRP’s current market dynamics. Among those who responded was Wietse Wind, a key developer in the XRP ecosystem and founder of Xaman. Wind pointed out that for a $1,000 order to be filled, the XRP Ledger’s automated market maker (AMM) and order book would first need to clear all existing orders between the current price and that value. How the XRP Ledger Processes Orders Wind explained that the XRP Ledger (XRPL) operates differently from centralized exchanges like Binance. Instead of directly matching buy and sell orders at fixed prices, the XRPL prioritizes orders based on the most competitive available offers. This means that any order at $1,000 would remain inactive until every lower-priced sell order, such as those at $3, $10, or $100, had been fulfilled. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Given this mechanism, Wind concluded that a single XRP token can’t be purchased at $1,000 under current market conditions, emphasizing that the order book would need to clear sequentially before such a trade could occur. Broader Context Around the $1,000 Price Target Despite criticism, Sanh has repeatedly expressed confidence that XRP could one day reach the $1,000 threshold, though he acknowledges this might take years. In past discussions, he referenced 2030 as a possible timeframe for such a scenario, though no technical or fundamental evidence supports this projection. Interestingly, other XRP advocates have echoed similar long-term predictions. Following Ripple’s recent acquisition of GTreasury, aimed at enhancing its liquidity management capabilities, community analyst XFinanceBull suggested that the move could strengthen XRP’s long-term value outlook and, in theory, pave the way toward significantly higher price levels. For context, an XRP price of $1,000 would imply a 43,000% increase from its current market value of about $2.35, resulting in a market capitalization of tens of trillions of dollars, figures that far exceed the total size of the global cryptocurrency market. Sanh’s post reflects a recurring theme in crypto communities: the belief that breakthroughs could redefine asset valuations in the long run.

The decline followed a selloff that wiped billions off the top digital assets. Historically, fear levels like these have led to major bounces as institutional players step in while retail traders panic. Market data indicates renewed accumulation of wallets across major exchanges, indicating a quiet confidence among long-term holders. Despite this caution, analysts have pointed to five best cryptos to buy that are displaying resilience and strong upside potential: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, and MAGACOIN FINANCE. These coins are still on the watch list of funds that are preparing for the next recovery phase. Each asset features strong fundamentals with an active community and consistent network activity. MAGACOIN FINANCE , specifically, stands out as one of the rapidly emerging altcoins that analysts predict will have impressive ROI and outperform due to its low entry point and strong market potential. 1. Bitcoin (BTC) — Institutional Confidence Builds Bitcoin is still the foundation of institutional crypto portfolios. Despite recent volatility, data indicate that large holders are accumulating near the $105,000 level. Institutions seem to be gearing up for the next market rebound with fear cycles as entry points. Analysts point out that Bitcoin’s liquidity and scarcity still provide long-term conviction. Historically, whenever the Fear Index was between 25 and 30, Bitcoin would rally back within weeks. Recent sentiment indicates that such a scenario could soon play out. With a dominance of over 52%, Bitcoin remains the primary trend setter for the market. 2. Ethereum (ETH) — Strength Behind Layer-1 Activity Ethereum’s pullback hasn’t affected its network health. Staking volumes are stable, and decentralized application activity continues to grow. Ethereum ETF inflows are expected to increase institutional exposure, providing renewed stability after recent declines. Additionally, developers continue to release updates and scaling solutions, further solidifying long-term belief in the asset. Its liquidity, smart-contract dominance, and steady user base make it an institution favorite as they look to get back in the game amid uncertainty. 3. Solana (SOL) — Oversold Levels Attract Buyers Solana’s recent dip has caught the attention of value-minded investors. Now, its RSI is showing oversold conditions, which is often the precursor to short-term recoveries. On-chain data reveals that large wallets are accumulating around the $180 level, suggesting a belief in Solana’s ecosystem strength. Analysts note that Solana’s developer community continues to be one of the fastest-growing in the industry. If the market sentiment stabilizes, Solana may retest the resistance at $220, bolstered by increasing institutional and retail participation. 4. Avalanche (AVAX) — Growing Enterprise Adoption Avalanche keeps expanding partnerships across traditional Finance and blockchain businesses. Its subnet technology ensures that institutions can use tokenized assets safely and effectively. Analysts believe this is a huge advantage as real-life asset tokenization is taking off. Avalanche’s low transaction fees and fast confirmation times continue to make it a top Layer-1 competitor. Its corporate traction puts it in a stronger position in the next rebound cycle. AVAX stands to gain from continual institutional adoption as international companies consider blockchain adoption worldwide. 5. MAGACOIN FINANCE — Analysts Project 200x Potential As the Fear and Greed Index hits 28, analysts have turned their attention to MAGACOIN FINANCE, a project gaining momentum despite the market downturn. Its token model, built around scarcity and transparent distribution, has helped it attract a loyal base of holders while many assets faced heavy selling. Whale-tracking platforms reveal steady accumulation since the pullback, a trend often seen in projects gaining traction before major recoveries. The limited token supply and transparent ecosystem have strengthened investor trust at a time when fear dominates the broader market. Analysts interpret this accumulation pattern as an early indicator of confidence returning to select altcoins. Institutional interest has also started to surface, with several analysts listing MAGACOIN FINANCE among high-upside watchlist projects. With a 200x projection , analysts believe its low entry point, growing base, and strong fundamentals could position it as one of the best crypto to buy before the next rebound cycle. Final Outlook Periods of fear often precede accumulation by disciplined investors. Data from previous cycles confirms that markets tend to recover quickly once institutional inflows stabilize. Analysts say sentiment indicators like the Fear and Greed Index often act as contrarian signals, rewarding those who buy when others hesitate. With institutional money quietly returning, the market appears to be setting up for another recovery wave. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, and MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out as one of the best cryptos to buy before the rebound strengthens. Each combines strong fundamentals with clear catalysts that could drive performance once fear gives way to renewed optimism.

53346733,https://timestabloid.com/?p=86856,1760832046,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP Supply Shock: How Token Burns Could Impact Price by 2035,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-supply-shock-how-token-burns-could-impact-price-by-2035/,"As XRP continues to trade below $2.30, conversations around its long-term token supply and potential scarcity have resurfaced. The XRP Ledger (XRPL), designed with a maximum supply of 100 billion tokens, consistently reduces its total through token burns attached to transaction fees. Presently, approximately 5,000 XRP are destroyed daily in this process. Although this figure appears minimal, several analysts argue that the cumulative effect of these burns, especially if daily network activity expands, could significantly reduce the available supply by 2035. Supply Projections and Possible Valuations At present, XRP’s circulating supply stands near 59.9 billion tokens, with a market capitalization of around $150 billion at a unit price of $2.35 . Analysts estimate that if the total supply declines by 40% within the next decade, the overall number of XRP tokens could fall to approximately 60 billion, while circulation might settle around 40 billion. This estimate factors in Ripple’s escrow holdings and assumes continuous burning alongside potential company participation in reducing outstanding tokens. If market demand remains stable under these conditions, the price could reach roughly $4.17 per token, a 77% increase from current levels. This calculation is based purely on scarcity-driven appreciation rather than expanded utility. However, supply contraction alone does not determine market value. XRP’s price trajectory will largely depend on its demand, which is influenced by real-world adoption and utility. Key factors include RippleNet’s payment volume, cross-border settlement usage, and broader integration of XRP Ledger services by institutions. If these adoption metrics grow, the combined effects of increased demand and declining supply could accelerate price growth. For example, a 50% rise in demand paired with a 40% supply reduction could push prices toward $6.25. Should demand double during the same period, XRP could trade above $8. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Moreover, if transaction volume expands significantly, resulting in 15,000 to 20,000 XRP burned daily, supply reduction could become more pronounced. By 2035, this scenario could remove over 100 million XRP from circulation, potentially lifting prices into the $12–$16 range , assuming steady demand levels. Assessing the Likelihood Despite these optimistic forecasts, achieving a 40% reduction in total supply may prove difficult. The current burn rate of 5,000 tokens per day equates to approximately 1.8 million XRP annually, just 20 million over the next decade. Such figures represent a small fraction of the total token pool. To create a significant impact, network activity and transaction volume would need to increase substantially. Even so, XRP’s capped supply structure and gradual deflationary design continue to support the argument for long-term value appreciation. Incremental rises in daily burns, combined with adoption growth, could still meaningfully reinforce its scarcity narrative. Broader Market Expectations While some analysts focus on deflationary projections, others envision far higher valuations based on long-term utility and institutional involvement. Cameron Scrubs, founder of Tradeship University, has suggested that XRP could overtake Bitcoin by 2030 and become the top cryptocurrency. Similarly, Coach JV has voiced confidence in XRP reaching the $300 mark in the future. Independent projections from Changelly also reflect a bullish stance, forecasting that XRP might climb to around $115 by December 2034. Although the possibility of a 40% supply cut by 2035 remains uncertain, the principle of scarcity supports XRP’s potential for gradual price appreciation. If network activity increases and adoption strengthens, XRP could benefit from both supply contraction and rising demand, setting the stage for higher valuations over the next decade.

Bitcoin Trendline Breach Sparks Talk Of Corrective Wave In Play,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-corrective-wave-in-play-2/,"Bitcoin’s weekly chart is at a pivotal point, with price action hovering around key structural levels. Traders are now questioning whether the current move marks the start of a deeper correction or just a healthy consolidation before the next leg up. Elliott Wave Signals Align With Developing Correction Elliott Waves Academy, in its latest analysis tracking Bitcoin’s expected wave path on the weekly timeframe, has raised a key question: has the corrective wave begun? The recent market structure indicates that the bullish leg has likely completed, and the price may now be transitioning into a corrective phase. A critical support level of the prior upward wave has been broken, hinting at a potential wave reversal in progress. Related Reading: Bitcoin On-Chain Activity Slumps Below 365-Day Average – Is Momentum Losing Steam? The evidence for this transition grows stronger when observing the break below the lower boundary of the diagonal pattern and the final price channel. Both of these structures previously acted as strong supports during Bitcoin’s impulsive climb, and their breakdown now suggests that market control is slowly shifting from buyers to sellers. Currently, Bitcoin is trading beneath the lower boundary of the price channel, which has flipped into a key resistance zone. As long as the price remains below this zone, bearish sentiment could persist, keeping the market in a cautious state. Despite the weakness, there are signs that the downward sub-wave might be nearing completion. The structure suggests that a short-term upward corrective wave could emerge as the market attempts to stabilize and regain footing. Expected Outlooks Sharing his expectations, Elliott Waves Academy noted that Bitcoin may continue to consolidate around its current levels as bulls attempt to defend their positions. Such a phase of sideways movement often reflects a period of indecision in the market, where both buyers and sellers are waiting for confirmation before committing to their next major moves. Related Reading: Bitcoin Structure Points To Healthy Correction Before Next Wave Toward $150,000 However, the Academy cautioned that if signs of weakness begin to emerge near the current resistance zone, the market could face a potential reversal. This shift could trigger renewed bearish pressure, pushing Bitcoin into a deeper corrective leg. According to the analysis, the correction could extend toward the 50%–61.8% Fibonacci retracement levels of the previous upward wave. These Fibonacci zones often serve as key areas of support during corrective movements, and a decline into these ranges could provide a more stable foundation for a future bullish reversal. Ultimately, monitoring price behavior around these crucial levels in the following days will be essential. Whether the market holds firm in consolidation or slips into a deeper retracement, the upcoming movements in these zones could set the tone for the next phase of Bitcoin’s long-term wave cycle.

The move underscores a widening divergence between traditional and digital stores of value, raising questions about BTC’s role as digital gold in a macro environment that should favor both. Momentum Gap: Bitcoin Stagnation And Gold Surge In a compelling and sobering perspective, the current state of the crypto market, particularly Bitcoin, is contrasting sharply with the performance of gold. As analyst Exy pointed out on X, Gold is breaking all-time highs week by week, and yet BTC hasn’t moved an inch. EXY also revealed that social risk is at zero, and Google Trends remains stagnant for BTC searches. Exy describes the current crypto environment as an internal struggle, where participants are pvping, liquidating, scamming, pumping, and dumping against each other. However, the market tops are in euphoria and not in a stagnant period, as observed in the ongoing movement of Gold. Interestingly, when gold starts to consolidate, other risk assets such as BTC could finally catch their bounce . Furthermore, the social risk will start improving once we see a consistent rate cut by the Federal Reserve (FED), which allows the normies to have extra cash monthly, and also quantitative easing (QE) to pump our assets . “Regardless, this isn’t over yet,” Exy noted. Gold $30 Trillion Dominance Puts BTC Potential Into Perspective CryptoRank.io has revealed that gold’s absolute inflow has exceeded Bitcoin’s by more than $15 trillion since January 1, 2024, underscoring the metal’s continued dominance as a global store of value. The Gold total market capitalization has surged to $29.6 trillion since the start of 2024, while BTC has climbed to $2.15 trillion . Despite BTC’s growing adoption and its integration into digital assets in institutional finance, investors continue to view gold as the primary safe-haven asset amid economic market uncertainty. At the same time, the gold narrative is evolving, with tokenized commodities such as Tether Gold (XAUT), PAX Gold (PAXG), and AurusGOLD (AWG) experiencing rapid growth, offering investors on-chain exposure to physical gold and other precious metals. Crypto expert theunipcs has also mentioned that the global gold market has now reached a staggering $30 trillion, adding over $12 trillion in value in the past year alone in its market cap. According to today’s metrics, if BTC captured just 10% of gold’s current market cap, it would trade around $150,700 per BTC, and that’s the bare minimum it would reach before this cycle tops out.",Bitcoin News|AurusGOLD|AWG|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|CryptoRank.io|gold|PAX Gold (PAXG)|Tether Gold (XAUT)|theunipc,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|FIAT|BTC|MACROECONOMICS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-19 00:00:59

As traders analyze what’s the best crypto to buy now, many are looking beyond legacy platforms to emerging projects with high growth potential. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one such project, currently priced at $0.035 in Phase 6 of its presale, with over 70% already sold out and $17.6 million raised, quickly gaining traction among retail investors. Its innovative dual-lending DeFi model, combining Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract liquidity pools, provides practical utility while offering potential for substantial returns, making it a top choice for crypto investment in 2025. For those seeking both established chains and promising new entrants, ADA’s updates and MUTM’s presale momentum together highlight the growing landscape of high-potential cryptocurrencies. Cardano (ADA) Price Prediction: Bullish Flag Indicates 138% Potential Upside Cardano (ADA) is ranging in a bullish flag chart pattern on the daily chart on October 15, 2025, following the establishment of a downward parallel channel after a spectacular July rally. With the price bouncing off the lower boundary at $0.6888 and resisting around $0.80–$0.85, which is also at the 50-day EMA value of $0.8051, investors eagerly await a breakout that will validate the resumption of the momentum of the previous pole. If ADA closes above the upper boundary of the flag and continues the same, the measured move estimates approximately a 138% rise, indicating $1.64, which is equal to the indicated resistance of $1.6324. While Cardano is observed by investors, so is Mutuum Finance, catching the eye of those who would like to discover the next big-growing crypto to add to the league of well-established market giants. Investor Mania Drives Mutuum Finance Presale Frenzy Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has emerged as a leading crypto project to make an investment in the DeFi space and a crowd favorite for those who wish to know the best crypto to buy now.

The project has already reached its 6th stage of presale, and the token has so far reached $0.035 after it increased by 16.17% from stage 5. Growing optimism among buyers has seen over 17,300 investors investing more than $17.6 million to date in the presale. Phase 6 is already 70% sold out, but interest still holds with the clock ticking for investors to get onboard before the end of this phase. This steady traction has further solidified Mutuum Finance’s position as a new cryptocurrency to watch and one of the best crypto investment opportunities developing legitimate utility in DeFi. Mutuum Finance Lending & Borrowing Protocol to Go Live in Q4 2025 The project will go live with its much-anticipated lending and borrowing protocol , which will be a milestone in its DeFi journey.

Market analysts are turning cautiously bullish, expecting a potential 40% relief rally before the end of the year as liquidity builds and whale wallets continue to buy the dip. At the same time, early investors are looking beyond Bitcoin toward emerging altcoins showing resilience in the current consolidation. Among them, MAGACOIN FINANCE has gained early traction among smart money circles — viewed as a hidden accumulation play positioned to outperform once capital rotates back into smaller, undervalued assets. Bitcoin Finds Stability at Key Support After weeks of volatility, Bitcoin has held the $104K–$106K range with strong buying activity from institutional and long-term holders. On-chain data from Glassnode shows rising exchange outflows, indicating that investors are moving BTC into cold storage — a sign of confidence in near-term recovery potential. If BTC maintains its current range through the end of the week, analysts expect momentum to build toward the $120K–$125K zone , mirroring similar relief rallies that occurred during the 2021 and 2023 cycles. Whales Accumulate as Fear Eases The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , which had dropped to 28 earlier this month, has now rebounded to 34 — signaling a gradual shift in market sentiment. This aligns with on-chain inflows showing that whale wallets (1,000+ BTC) have accumulated over $650 million in the last five days. Such accumulation phases often mark the turning points of mid-cycle corrections, with analysts noting that “the quiet accumulation phase” tends to precede sharp upside breakouts. Altcoins Could Follow Bitcoin’s Rebound If Bitcoin confirms its 40% relief rally, analysts expect leading altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) , Solana (SOL) , and Cardano (ADA) to mirror the move. These assets have entered oversold zones with attractive risk-reward ratios for Q4 positioning. Projects like HYPE , AVAX , and SUI are also being highlighted as potential outperformers once liquidity returns — particularly as investors begin to rotate away from Bitcoin into higher-growth opportunities. MAGACOIN FINANCE Attracts Early Accumulators During periods of consolidation, smart investors often look for undervalued small-cap plays with high upside potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as one of the few projects sustaining steady momentum through this correction. The project’s audited framework, active presale performance, and growing social engagement have positioned it as a market-cycle accumulation favorite among retail and whale investors alike. Analysts suggest that if Bitcoin’s rebound triggers another round of altcoin inflows, MAGACOIN FINANCE could become one of the biggest beneficiaries heading into early 2025. Analysts Predict Relief Rally Before Year-End Most experts agree that the coming weeks will determine whether Bitcoin’s $105K support holds as the macro floor for the next upward leg. If it does, a sharp 40% rally toward $145K could unfold, reigniting broader market enthusiasm. As confidence returns, traders are positioning early across key sectors — with Bitcoin, Solana, and MAGACOIN FINANCE among the assets most likely to lead the year-end rebound.

With over $536 million in Spot Bitcoin ETF outflows in a single day, the downturn has sparked renewed fears of an extended bearish phase. Analysts are calling this correction a “Bloody Friday,” a less but still severe reflection of last week’s brutal selloff that wiped billions in the market and saw BTC and ETH spiraling downwards. Related Reading: Biggest Shiba Inu Burn In Months — And It Came From A Coinbase Account ETF Outflows Trigger Bitcoin And Ethereum Price Crash The recent crash in Bitcoin and Ethereum prices is being attributed to recent large-scale outflows from US Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Crypto analyst Jana on X social media described the event as one of the bloodiest weekly downturns of the quarter, with Bitcoin tumbling 13.3% in seven days and Ethereum sliding 17.8% over the past month. At press time, Bitcoin is trading slightly above $106,940 while Ethereum sits around $3,870, both suffering steep retracements from their recent highs. Data from SoSoValue shows that Thursday, October 16, saw a staggering $536.4 million in daily net outflows from Spot Bitcoin ETFs, marking the largest single-day negative flow since August 1, when $812 million exited the market. Out of twelve US Bitcoin ETFs, eight registered major outflows, led by $275.15 million leaving Ark & 21Shares’ ARKB, followed by $132 million from Fidelity’s FBTC. Notably, funds managed by other major companies like Grayscale, BlackRock, Bitwise, VanEck, and Valkyrie also reported significant withdrawals. These persistent outflows have now stretched into their third consecutive day, with October 17, just a day ago, recording a massive outflow of $366.5 million. The sustained negative ETF flows underscore waning investor confidence and suggest that the broader market downturn could continue in the near term. Combined with the $19 billion liquidation event last Friday, increased outflows in ETFs could put more selling pressure on the already fragile market. Experts Warn Of Deeper Market Pain Ahead Many experts believe that the crypto market may still have more room for a decline. Data from Polymarket, one of the world’s largest prediction platforms, show that 52% of participants expect Bitcoin to drop below $100,000 before the end of October. Veteran economist and Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff has also warned that the coming months could be catastrophic for the industry, predicting widespread bankruptcies, defaults, and layoffs as Bitcoin and Ethereum face another major leg down. Meanwhile, technical analysts are pointing to signs of deeper weakness in Ethereum’s structure. According to Crypto Damus, Ethereum has broken key weekly support and is displaying a bearish setup on the charts. He says that MACD is about to “cross red,” leaving a significant amount of room for a crash. Other analysts like Marzell have echoed similar concerns, stating that Ethereum is now nearing a “crash zone.” However, he also highlighted the $3,690 – $3,750 range as a possible short-term demand area where buyers could step in again and trigger the next leg up.

53349746,609198,1760837425,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53349746.jpeg,Rumors Circulate That Ripple Is Buying $1 Billion Worth Of XRP — Here’s What We Know,https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-buying-1-billion-of-xrp/,"Crypto firm Ripple is reportedly set to raise up to $1 billion to set up an XRP treasury firm. The firm is notably the largest XRP holder and plans to contribute some of its holdings to this proposed venture. Ripple To Raise $1 Billion For XRP Treasury According to a Bloomberg report , Ripple is leading an effort to raise at least $1 billion to buy XRP. These coins will be held by a new digital-asset treasury firm , which will hold XRP as its primary reserve asset. Meanwhile, the crypto firm plans to raise this sum through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). The proposed XRP treasury firm by Ripple could become the largest in the U.S. if it raises up to $1 billion to buy XRP. Meanwhile, Bloomberg reported that Ripple also plans to contribute some of its own XRP to facilitate this move. The crypto firm is the largest XRP holder , holding over 40% of the token’s total supply, including its holdings in escrow. It is worth noting that XRP Ledger (XRPL) validator Vet revealed that Ripple sent $500 million in XRP to a new account. He said that the account is not escrowed and doesn’t have multi sig, which he claimed is surprising given the account value. This has led to speculation that the transfer may be related to the $1 billion treasury firm the crypto firm is looking to set up. In addition to the $1 billion fundraise for an XRP treasury firm, Ripple also recently acquired GTreasury for $1 billion, expanding into the corporate treasury markets. This is also considered another major win for XRP, as Ripple and GTreasury plan to let customers use the crypto firm’s payment solution for real-time cross-border transactions, which they facilitate using XRP. Significance Of The XRP Treasury Firm XRP commentator Kahneman noted the significance of the SPAC in Ripple’s plans to set up a $1 billion XRP treasury firm. He explained that this would be a publicly disclosed, regulated liquidity pool capable of handling corporate treasury flows. Meanwhile, Ripple just bought GTreasury , meaning that both moves could be intertwined. Kahneman further remarked that a SPAC would let the payment firm offer a regulated liquidity pool that corporate treasuries can use, even though the crypto firm is a private company. He added that this separates Ripple’s operating business from a compliant pool. Therefore, the XRP commentator opined that this could signal that the crypto firm intends to remain private for a while longer. Ripple has so far not revealed any plans for a potential IPO despite the XRP lawsuit already ending. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.32, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",XRP|Coinmarketcap|GTreasury|IPO|Kahneman|ripple|spac|Special Purpose Acquisition Company|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRP Treasury|XRPL|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-19 01:30:25

We are a strong economy. We are four hundred fifty million people… So we should play the European card in a more offensive way.” The economist, who also sits on the European Central Bank’s Governing Council, made it clear that the continent should not rely on others to protect its markets. “The most important market for the European is Europe itself,” he said. Trump’s on-and-off-again tariffs on China this year have triggered a new wave of retaliation from Beijing, forcing Chinese exporters to redirect goods to markets like Europe, where they are often sold below local production costs. Economists warn that this is squeezing European manufacturers while Beijing’s restrictions on rare earths, materials critical for technology and defense industries, further deepen the imbalance. Across China, European companies continue to struggle against heavily subsidized domestic competitors, according to Reuters. Netherlands takes control of Nexperia amid pressure from Washington Now earlier this week, the Dutch government seized Nexperia, a semiconductor company that produces basic chips for automobiles, consumer electronics, and industrial devices, from its Chinese owner and chief executive Zhang Xuezheng. The takeover, approved in 2017, was reversed under an emergency law citing “preservation of crucial technological knowledge, as well as production and development capacities in the Netherlands and Europe.” Economy Minister Vincent Karremans told parliament on Saturday that Zhang had improperly transferred intellectual property and financial resources to a foreign entity he controlled, even after all the warnings from Washington, which had already blacklisted Zhang’s company Wingtech in December and placed heavy export restrictions. When U.S. officials informed The Hague that upcoming rule changes would expand those limits to include Nexperia, the Dutch government took control on September 30. Beijing condemned the seizure, with the China Chamber of Commerce to the EU calling it a “modern act of economic banditry.” Following the decision, China banned the export of certain Nexperia products assembled within its borders. Analysts from the Rhodium Group described the situation as part of Washington’s unspoken effort to “claw back strategic assets” from Chinese hands under the pretext of national security. While The Hague denied acting under U.S. direction, court filings revealed clear American pressure during the process. The fallout has also highlighted the growing complexity of Europe’s semiconductor supply chain. Even with production on European soil, dependence on China persists for assembly and raw materials. The European Union’s Chips Act, which aims to produce 20% of global chips by 2030, is already struggling, with multiple projects delayed or abandoned. China tightens rare earth exports as Europe lags behind As the Nexperia case unfolded, China introduced sweeping new restrictions on rare earth exports, mirroring U.S. technology bans. The move threatens to disrupt supply chains vital to European industries, particularly the automotive and defense sectors. Partial curbs have already driven up costs and delayed production. Europe, with its heavy investments in electric vehicles and wind energy, stands more exposed than the United States. The EU’s Critical Raw Materials Act, passed last year to diversify supply chains, has stalled. A €1 billion German fund meant to support critical mineral projects was paused, and progress toward reducing dependency remains slow. Rebecca Arcesati and Jacob Gunter from the Mercator Institute for China Studies argued that Europe must act “more decisively,” using subsidies and regulations to promote new mining and processing operations and stepping in as a “buyer of last resort” when needed. Meanwhile, Beijing’s export bans have pushed European leaders to rethink their approach. The European Commission has accused China of flooding markets with underpriced industrial goods and ignoring calls to reduce overcapacity. The EU first imposed tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, but that barely dented sales, it only prompted Beijing to retaliate with its own tariffs on European brandy, pork, and dairy imports. Trade analyst Noah Barkin, writing for the German Marshall Fund, described the episode as proof that “the EU has been too slow, too timid, and too wedded to a rulebook the others have torn up.” During her July trip to Beijing, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU-China relationship had reached an “inflection point.” Some of the plans under review by the EU are:- tighter restrictions on steel imports, mandatory local content rules, and technology-sharing requirements for new Chinese investments in apparently the entirety of Europe. But the main question, officials reportedly admit, is whether EU capitals are ready to use those tools or keep waiting while others set the rules. That remains to be seen.

The decision came on Friday, October 18, from U.S. District Judge Phyllis Hamilton, who signed a 25-page order laying out the permanent injunction. According to Reuters, the court’s order shuts down any attempt by NSO to use its spyware tools on Meta-owned WhatsApp, a platform used by over two billion people around the world. The spyware in question is Pegasus, NSO’s main product, which is designed to exploit vulnerabilities in everyday apps and secretly monitor phones. That includes grabbing texts, calls, and location data. For years, Pegasus has used WhatsApp as a key entry point. That ends now. In court filings, NSO warned that if the judge blocked them from going after WhatsApp, it would “put NSO’s entire enterprise at risk” and potentially “force NSO out of business.” Judge reduces damages from $167 million to $4 million While the injunction hit hard, Judge Phyllis Hamilton also gave NSO a financial break. A previous jury decision had slapped the company with $167 million in punitive damages owed to Meta, but the judge cut that figure down to just $4 million. That’s a 97% reduction, which NSO said it “welcomed.” Still, the legal blow from the permanent ban on targeting WhatsApp outweighed the financial relief. NSO, based in Israel, released a statement saying the ban doesn’t apply to their clients. The company said its customers “will continue using the company’s technology to help protect public safety.” NSO also said it’s still reviewing the judge’s ruling and “will determine its next steps accordingly.” No timeline was given. Meanwhile, Meta executives responded to the ruling with satisfaction. Will Cathcart, head of WhatsApp, posted on X (formerly Twitter): “Today’s ruling bans spyware maker NSO from ever targeting WhatsApp and our global users again. We applaud this decision that comes after six years of litigation to hold NSO accountable for targeting members of civil society.” This judgment comes just weeks after reports surfaced that NSO was bought by a group led by Hollywood producer Robert Simonds. The acquisition was reported by TechCrunch, though Simonds has not responded to requests for comment. Meta updates WhatsApp API terms to block AI chatbot developers While dealing with the NSO ruling, Meta quietly made another major move. The company changed WhatsApp’s Business API policy this week to ban general-purpose AI chatbot developers from the platform. That change will affect developers behind OpenAI, Perplexity, Luzia (backed by Khosla Ventures), and Poke (backed by General Catalyst). The updated policy adds a new section aimed directly at “AI Providers.” That includes companies developing or distributing large language models, generative AI platforms, or any tool considered a general-purpose AI assistant. Under the new rules, these AI providers are forbidden from accessing or using the WhatsApp Business Solution, whether they’re doing so directly or indirectly. Meta made it clear that the ban is only on AI companies where chatbot services are the main offering. Businesses using AI for basic customer support tasks won’t be affected. A travel company, for example, can still run a simple customer service bot. The new rules will go into effect on January 15th, as Meta explained in its press release, adding that the original intent of the Business API was for business-to-customer communications, not as a launchpad for third-party chatbots. The company said it noticed more developers using the API for general-purpose chatbots recently—something it never intended when building the system. The entire update shows Meta trying to tighten control over how WhatsApp is used. That includes shutting out AI assistants that don’t align with its vision for the platform.

Speaking in Washington during the IMF’s annual meetings, Lagarde said fiscal policy “will play a more supportive role in the years ahead,” especially for countries increasing defense investments, pointing out that “this is certainly the case (in a big way) by Germany, where major military and infrastructure investments are underway.” Lagarde added that those projects “are just beginning to have an impact but will be rolled out over the next three years in a very significant way,” according to Bloomberg. Lagarde said Germany is finally “using its balance sheet and its capacity to borrow,” signaling the end of its long-standing reluctance to spend. Much of that change comes from Friedrich Merz, the new German chancellor, who pushed through a landmark spending bill before even taking office. The plan unlocks federal borrowing to rebuild Germany’s infrastructure and overhaul its military. Lagarde described it bluntly: “Agent of change Germany — who would have thought?” Germany boosts growth plans with €400 billion investment drive Sharing the stage with Lagarde, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva praised the decision.“My message is: bravo, bravo, bravo,” she said.“Because what Germany is demonstrating is that imbalances can be addressed, it is a matter of will, and mostly political will.” Georgieva’s remarks came as optimism builds across Europe that Germany’s fiscal push could lift growth in the region, which has long relied on the country’s cautious approach to spending. Earlier this week, Merz proposed creating a pan-European stock exchange to strengthen competitiveness against the United States and Asia. Lagarde reacted to the plan, saying, “When I hear the German chancellor say we need in Europe one single stock market, one single supervision — that means a lot. How that will materialize, how it will take place, how it will work out, I don’t know.” The spending program, secured before Merz took office last month, could add more than €400 billion ($470 billion) to Germany’s annual output by 2030, according to the German government’s panel of economic advisers. That would lift average GDP growth by 1.6%, slightly above the long-term pace since reunification in 1990. Monika Schnitzer, the panel’s chair, said expectations among businesses and the public are “extremely high,” adding that “action must be taken quickly.” Investors rally as Germany emerges from years of restraint Investor confidence in Germany, meanwhile, has been rising all year. The DAX index has hit new records, making it one of the best-performing stock markets this year, behind only Spain’s IBEX and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng. The enthusiasm proves the growing belief that Germany is regaining economic momentum at a time of political uncertainty in the United States under President Donald Trump. After years of tight budgets, Germany holds the lowest debt-to-GDP ratio among G7 nations, giving it space to borrow for growth. Economists say the turnaround represents the biggest policy change in a generation. But challenges remain; political divisions and weak coordination could slow down progress if not handled carefully. Deutsche Bank upgraded its growth forecast on the back of Merz’s fiscal plan, predicting 2% growth for Germany next year. Still, the bank warned that momentum might fade if funds are funneled into consumption rather than investment. Alexander von zur Mühlen, Deutsche Bank’s head of Asia-Pacific, said, “Outside of Europe they say: the sleeping giant Germany has woken up. We need to use the momentum.” Economic advisers reportedly cautioned that if spending is directed toward short-term relief like cutting restaurant taxes or incentives for electric vehicles, instead of long-term infrastructure, rail, and technology, the growth effect could be halved. For now, Germany’s economic comeback is being tested by whether it can turn massive borrowing into lasting results, without losing focus or wasting its newfound fiscal power.

That means a worker earning the federal minimum wage would need to work nearly three full weeks to afford a single ounce. The gold price closed around $4,225 per ounce at press time, while average hourly earnings stood at $36.50 in August, leaving income growth far behind. The ratio has doubled in only 18 months, smashing previous all-time highs of 80 hours seen during the 1930s, 1980, and 2011. At the start of this millennium, the same ounce cost less than 20 hours of labor, a reminder of how far this metal has outrun real wages. Gold’s rally has accelerated as investors pile in, betting on rate cuts from the Federal Reserve and global counterparts, as well as looking for safety amid growing geopolitical tension. The metal has surged by 64% so far this year, helped by central bank buying, outflows from the U.S. dollar, and strong inflows into exchange-traded funds tied to gold. Markets are now betting on a 25-basis-point cut at the October meeting and another in December, fueling even more optimism among traders who see the metal climbing beyond $4,400 in the coming years. Gold drops after record high above $4,300 amid Trump’s tariff remarks After a week of euphoria, gold prices slipped on Friday, retreating 2.6% to $4,211.48 per ounce bymidday, after hitting an all-time high of $4,378.69 earlier in the session. US gold futures for December delivery also dipped 2.1% to $4,213.30, while the dollar index rose 0.1%, making bullion more expensive for overseas buyers. President Donald Trump told reporters that a “full-scale” tariff on China would be unsustainable, cooling some of the speculation that had driven gold higher through the week. “I think Trump’s more conciliatory tone since the initial announcement of 100% tariffs has taken a little heat out of the precious trade,” said Tai Wong, an independent metals trader in New York. Trump confirmed that he would meet with his Chinese counterpart, a decision that slightly eased market jitters over the escalating trade conflict. Even with the pullback, gold was on pace for a 4.8% weekly gain, its biggest since September 2008, when the collapse of Lehman Brothers sent investors scrambling for safety. Suki Cooper, head of commodities research at Standard Chartered Bank, said her team expects gold to average $4,488 in 2026, adding that “broader structural factors” could push prices even higher. HSBC raised its 2025 forecast by $100 to $3,455 per ounce, projecting a potential climb to $5,000 by 2026. Physical demand in Asia also stayed solid despite record prices, with Indian premiums rising to a decade-high ahead of local festivals. Meanwhile, silver fell 5.6% to $51.20, after touching $54.47, while platinum slid 6.1% to $1,607.85 and palladium lost 7.9% to $1,485.50. Speculative excess grows as gold enters its third breakout in 50 years This is the third breakout for gold in five decades, following the 1979–1980 and 2010–2011 booms, both of which ended in brutal crashes. In those eras, investors feared the Federal Reserve would allow inflation to destroy the dollar. During the 1970s, the Fed was seen as bowing to political pressure from President Richard Nixon, while after the 2008 crisis, many worried that massive bond purchases would debase the currency. Both fears proved wrong. In the early 1980s, the Fed’s aggressive tightening halved gold’s value in two years. It took over 25 years for the metal to reclaim its 1980 peak, and only this year did it surpass that inflation-adjusted level. After 2011, gold tumbled for five years before rebounding in 2020, yet it was still cheaper as recently as two years ago. Now, the surge looks eerily similar to past speculative frenzies. While investors argue “this time is different,” the pattern of rapid gains and euphoric buying hasn’t changed. The push for alternatives to the dollar has intensified since the freezing of Russian reserves after the Ukraine invasion, driving central banks across developing nations to boost gold holdings over fears that Western assets might be vulnerable in a crisis.

Notably, the leading cryptocurrency dipped below $105,000 on Friday as crypto liquidations rose to above $1.2 billion. However, underlying investor buying activity paints an encouraging picture of a potentially bullish rebound. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Price Is Ready To Surge: ‘We Would Already Be Below $108,000 If The Crash Wasn’t Over’ Bitcoin Net Taker Volume Hits $309 Million Despite Price Fall In a QuickTake post on X, popular analyst Amr Taha shares an exchange activity update on the Bitcoin market amidst a significant price correction. The pundit reports a major uptick in buying pressure, which suggests investors may be quietly accumulating despite the present price weakness. Notably, on-chain data shows that the Bitcoin crash to below $105,000 coincided with a spike in the net taker volume on Binance to around $309 million, marking its first positive zone since October 10. In trading terms, buy-taker volume represents orders that actively hit the ask, i.e., traders willing to buy immediately at market price rather than waiting for a better entry. The move indicates that, despite short-term volatility, there remains a deep undercurrent of bullish conviction among Bitcoin holders and traders. This high accumulation activity during a price demand usually precedes local bottom formations, as aggressive buyers absorb selling pressure, setting the stage for a parabolic price rebound. Furthermore, while the taker volume surged, Amr Taha reports that the open interest (OI), which measures the total number of outstanding futures and perpetual contracts, failed to rise in tandem. This divergence suggests that trading activity is concentrated in the spot market rather than in leveraged derivatives, reinforcing the fact that investors are actively participating in the present market state. In summary, the renowned crypto analyst views this exchange activity development as a potential bullish undercurrent. Taha explains that spot accumulation around key liquidity levels, such as the $105K zone, often serves as a foundation for future price recoveries once selling pressure subsides.

However, the expert anticipates the premier cryptocurrency may still see a further decline before eventually finding a bottom around $92,000. In line with a growing notion, Jebb hinges his bullish thesis on a potential rotation of capital from the gold market to Bitcoin once the former hits a new market peak. Notably, gold is currently maintaining an impressive bullish momentum, having become the first asset to surpass a $30 trillion market capitalization value. Jebb predicts an eventual capital rotation when the gold market starts to correct, with potential inflows expected to push Bitcoin to around the $150,000 price mark in January.

The Seattle-based cybersecurity company admitted in filings that its systems had been compromised for nearly two years, allowing attackers “long-term, persistent access” to its internal infrastructure. The breach reportedly exposed source code, sensitive configuration data, and information about undisclosed software vulnerabilities in its BIG-IP platform, a technology that powers the networks of 85% of Fortune 500 companies and many US federal agencies. The hackers broke in through F5’s own software, which had been left exposed online after employees failed to follow internal security policies. The attackers exploited that weak point to enter and roam freely inside systems that should have been locked down. F5 company told customers that the oversight directly violated the same cyber guidelines the company teaches its clients to follow. When the news broke, F5’s shares fell more than 10% on October 16, wiping out millions in market value. “Since that vulnerability information is out there, everyone using F5 should assume they’re compromised,” said Chris Woods, a former security executive with HP who is now founder of CyberQ Group Ltd., a cybersecurity services firm in the UK. Hackers used F5’s own technology to maintain stealth and control F5 sent customers on Wednesday a threat hunting guide for a type of malware called Brickstorm used by Chinese state-backed hackers, according to Bloomberg. Mandiant, which was hired by F5, confirmed that Brickstorm allowed hackers to move quietly through VMware virtual machines and deeper infrastructure. After securing their foothold, the intruders stayed inactive for over a year, an old but effective tactic meant to outwait the company’s security log retention period. Logs, which record every digital trace, are often deleted after 12 months to save costs. Once those logs were gone, the hackers reactivated and pulled data from BIG-IP, including source code and vulnerability reports. F5 said that while some customer data was accessed, it has no real evidence that hackers changed its source code or used the stolen information to exploit clients. F5’s BIG-IP platform handles load balancing and network security, routing digital traffic and shielding systems from intrusion. US and UK governments issue emergency warnings The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) called the incident a “significant cyber threat targeting federal networks.” In an emergency directive issued on Wednesday, CISA ordered all federal agencies to identify and update their F5 products by October 22. The UK’s National Cyber Security Centre also issued an alert about the breach on Wednesday, warning that hackers could use their access to F5 systems to exploit the company’s technology and to identify additional vulnerabilities. Following the disclosure, F5 CEO Francois Locoh-Donou held briefings with customers to explain the scope of the breach. Francois confirmed that the company had called in CrowdStrike and Google’s Mandiant to assist alongside law enforcement and government investigators. Officials familiar with the probe allegedly told Bloomberg that the Chinese government was behind the attack. But a Chinese spokesperson dismissed the accusation as “groundless and made without evidence.” Ilia Rabinovich, Sygnia’s vice president of cybersecurity consulting, said that in the case Sygnia disclosed last year, hackers hid inside F5’s appliances and used them as a “command and control” base to infiltrate victim networks undetected. “There is a potential for it to evolve into something that is massive, because numerous organizations deploy those devices,” he said.

Yet, while retail traders exit in fear, seasoned investors — often referred to as “smart money” — are quietly rotating into smaller, high-upside plays that historically outperform following sharp market resets. Among these accumulation targets, HYPE and SUI have emerged as standout opportunities due to their on-chain growth and consistent whale activity. Meanwhile, investors are also tracking MAGACOIN FINANCE — a low-cap altcoin quietly building momentum as a potential early-cycle gem heading into 2025’s next major market rotation. XRP and Cardano Hit Oversold Zones Both XRP and Cardano have entered oversold territory, with RSI readings near their lowest levels in over six months. XRP is currently hovering around $2.20 , while ADA trades just above $0.60 . Analysts say this type of price action often signals the end of a correction phase, where institutional buyers begin scaling back into quality projects. Despite the near-term weakness, the underlying fundamentals of both coins remain strong — particularly XRP’s growing institutional adoption and Cardano’s continued DeFi expansion. Smart Money Rotates Into HYPE and SUI While retail sentiment remains shaky, whales have shifted focus to HYPE and SUI — two mid-cap altcoins showing impressive accumulation patterns. HYPE continues to dominate social sentiment rankings, with analysts predicting it could deliver 25x to 40x returns in the next market cycle. SUI , on the other hand, has benefited from a steady rise in developer activity and DeFi integrations, suggesting strong network growth heading into 2025. On-chain data supports the rotation trend, showing consistent wallet growth and capital inflows to both tokens during periods of broader market fear. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Ground as a Hidden Accumulation Play Beyond established altcoins, MAGACOIN FINANCE has captured early investor attention for its ability to sustain momentum through volatile market conditions. The project’s successful audit and active presale have built confidence among early backers who view it as a strategic accumulation target before the next bull phase. Analysts highlight MAGACOIN FINANCE’s rising community engagement and liquidity growth as signs that smart money is positioning early — echoing the accumulation behavior seen in successful early-stage tokens from previous market cycles. Analysts Expect a Rotation-Driven Recovery Historically, after large-cap coins like XRP and Cardano bottom out, smaller, undervalued projects tend to deliver outsized returns as the market rotates upward. This shift from safety to growth has been the catalyst behind every major bull cycle since 2017. If Bitcoin continues holding above $105K and sentiment recovers in November, analysts believe HYPE , SUI , and MAGACOIN FINANCE could be among the undervalued 2025 gems that lead the next phase of altcoin acceleration.

53356931,609263,1760842850,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53356931.jpeg,40 Days Of Deadlock: US Shutdown Risks ETF Delay Amid Soaring Demand,https://bitcoinist.com/40-days-of-deadlock-us-shutdown-risks-etf-delay-amid-soaring-demand/,"The US federal funding lapse has stretched on, creating new delays for regulatory decisions tied to crypto products. According to reports, the shutdown has lasted beyond 40 days in some scenarios used by market forecasters, and reduced staffing at federal agencies is slowing routine approvals. Shutdown Stretches Past 40 Days Reports have disclosed a market estimate putting the chance of a prolonged shutdown at about 55% for certain stretches, which traders say complicates timing for filings and reviews. The Securities and Exchange Commission is operating with fewer staff, and that has forced some rulemakings and approval windows to be pushed back. For applicants hoping for quick sign-offs, this means waiting longer than planned. Investor Interest Remains High Despite the holdup, investor appetite for regulated crypto products appears strong. According to filings and traffic data cited in market reports, clients of Charles Schwab hold roughly 20% of the US crypto ETF market by assets under custody, and web visits to crypto information pages have jumped about 90% on an annualized basis. That shows demand is not evaporating while regulators are idle. What That Means For Markets When reviews resume in force, some strategists expect pent-up demand to move into newly approved products. Based on reports, the delay has simply shifted the calendar rather than killed the approvals. Yet market reaction is not guaranteed to be large; some money may already be waiting on the sidelines, while other investors have moved on. Backlog Could Trigger A Fast Response Regulatory staff will face a backlog when full operations return. Papers awaiting attention may be prioritized, and several issuers will press to get decisions cleared. Sources tracking the space warn that a sudden cluster of approvals could follow the end of the funding gap, creating rapid inflows into the newly cleared funds. Risks Beyond Timing The shutdown is one of several risks. Reports point to the fact that approvals depend on legal arguments, compliance steps, and the agency’s view on market structure. A temporary staffing shortfall delays work, but it does not change the substantive questions the regulator must answer before signing off. That means some applications could still be rejected or heavily conditioned.

He mentioned plans to monitor its intraday chart closely for potential quick scalp opportunities, particularly if LINK holds above $16.80, which he views as a positive zone. A Possible Shift In Chainlink’s Current Bearish Action Moving on, CryptoWzrd pointed out that both Chainlink and LINKBTC closed the day with bearish candles, signaling short-term weakness. The downside move came after a period of consolidation, suggesting that traders may be taking profits following recent gains. Despite the pullback, the analyst emphasized that the overall market context still holds potential for recovery. Related Reading: Chainlink Targets $22 As LINKBTC Shows Signs Of Reversal – Is The Next Rally Close? He further explained that LINKBTC could experience an upward push if Bitcoin dominance shows positive sentiment tomorrow. A recovery in Bitcoin’s strength often translates to renewed confidence in the broader altcoin market, and LINK could benefit from this correlation. According to CryptoWzrd, LINK’s retest of the $16 daily support level played out exactly as anticipated. This zone now represents a crucial decision point, holding above it could trigger a rebound toward the next major resistance of $20 and beyond if market conditions remain stable. However, he cautioned that with the weekend approaching, volatility may rise and market volume could thin out. As a result, CryptoWzrd maintained a balanced stance, noting that it is essential to keep expectations rational and remain alert for any signs of renewed bearish pressure. Bullish Breakout Could Ignite A Rally Toward $19.30 Concluding his analysis, CryptoWzrd noted that Chainlink’s intraday chart displayed notable volatility throughout the day, with rapid price swings keeping traders on edge. Despite the choppy movements, the price is now teasing the $16.80 intraday resistance, a level that could play a pivotal role in determining the next short-term direction. Related Reading: Chainlink (LINK) Triangle Setup Points To $100, Says Analyst He explained that a bullish breakout above $16.80 would likely trigger a wave of renewed buying pressure. Such a move could pave the way for a rally toward the $19.30 target, an area where previous price action has shown a strong reaction and potential for profit-taking. On the other hand, CryptoWzrd cautioned that a rejection from $16.80 or prolonged trading below this resistance could lead to more sideways movement over the weekend. With lower trading volumes expected, this range-bound behavior may continue until a clear catalyst emerges to drive momentum in either direction. He concluded by emphasizing the importance of patience and clarity in the current setup. The market is at a decision point, and waiting for a stronger trade formation could offer a safer entry opportunity.

Although it tried to recover some ground in the following days, the Friday market-wide correction pushed it south once again, and it is currently fighting to stay above $0.20. Here’s what ChatGPT, Grok, and Gemini predict about its performance in the week ahead. What’s Next for PI? From a top 20 altcoin by market cap to barely remaining in the largest 80 club, PI has experienced its fair share of price collapses. Unfortunately for the Pi Network investor base, the three AIs did not give much hope for the asset’s performance in the following seven days. However, this might not be entirely its fault, as the entire market has been struggling for over a week now. In terms of technical markers, Grok noted that the first line of defense for PI is the recent all-time low at around $0.17-$0.18. If that support is breached, there are no historical levels that can support it on the way down. On the more positive side, though, it said that the RSI is heavily oversold (well below 30), which could result in a “short-term relief rally.” However, PI needs to see some more (buying) volume, as the current weak levels display “low speculative interest.” According to Gemini, PI can initiate a more substantial rebound only if it reclaims the first key resistance zones at $0.22 and $0.24, where it was rejected earlier this week. Still Bears’ Country ChatGPT was predominantly bearish on PI’s short-term price performance. It asserted that the adverse price moves are likely to continue in the following days, putting a 60% chance for a bearish continuation. “If $0.20 fails to hold, sellers could push PI toward a new low between $0.15–$0.17. Thin liquidity means even small sell orders can trigger sharp dips.” Consequently, the chances for a quick rebound are lower – somewhere around 25% to 30%, while a price stabilization and consolidation at these levels have a 15% probability, according to the OpenAI solution. “Expect continued weakness and possible new lows before any meaningful rebound. Without fresh momentum or external listings, PI will likely trade between $0.17–$0.23 next week, reflecting a fragile and speculative market phase,” ChatGPT noted at the end.

After a month-long correction, on-chain data suggests whale accumulation is quietly returning across major altcoins. Analysts say assets like Cardano (ADA) and SUI are now entering deeply oversold zones, creating what some call “the perfect volatility window” for explosive gains once market sentiment shifts. While blue-chip cryptos consolidate, investors seeking earlier exposure are turning to MAGACOIN FINANCE — a rising Ethereum-based project that’s attracting high engagement and fresh capital inflows from traders betting on new-cycle narratives. Ethereum’s Correction May Signal Accumulation Phase Despite the decline, Ethereum remains structurally strong. Analysts highlight that ETH’s RSI near 35 mirrors previous reversal points that preceded multi-month rallies. Open interest on derivatives has cooled, reducing downside risk, while whale wallets continue moving coins off exchanges — a sign of confidence returning. If ETH reclaims $3,900–$4,000 , it could confirm the start of a new accumulation phase leading into the year-end altcoin rebound. Cardano and SUI Flash Bullish Divergences Cardano and SUI are showing similar price exhaustion signals. ADA has tested long-term support near $0.59 , while SUI’s volume and address activity are both up double digits week-over-week. Market strategists say these are early signs of smart money repositioning ahead of the next rotation wave. Analysts expect a synchronized rally once Ethereum stabilizes, potentially kicking off one of the strongest altcoin phases since early 2023. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Momentum Ahead of Exchange Access While most projects slow down in bearish markets, MAGACOIN FINANCE is accelerating — both in investor growth and market visibility. Backed by a verified audit and rising global community participation, the project has become a go-to hedge for investors looking beyond short-term volatility. Industry analysts note that MAGACOIN FINANCE’s next major catalyst — the upcoming exchange listing phase — could act as a price discovery event , opening access to a wider trading audience. With a growing base of loyal holders and increasing exposure among Ethereum and Cardano traders, many see it as a strong speculative contender in the next rotation cycle. Analysts Predict Market Rotation Into Q4 Crypto markets thrive on rotation, and analysts believe that once Ethereum stabilizes, capital will move quickly into undervalued altcoins. Historically, such rotations have fueled some of the most profitable multi-week runs across DeFi and presale tokens. As ADA and SUI flash bottom signals, and accumulation builds around Ethereum-based newcomers like MAGACOIN FINANCE, analysts say this setup could mirror the early 2021 cycle — where smart money accumulation preceded months of sustained growth.

Here’s What Happened",https://timestabloid.com/investor-3000000-xrp-just-stolen-from-my-cold-wallet-heres-what-happened/,"A recent post from Digital Asset Investor (@digitalassetbuy) on X revealed a distressing account from a longtime XRP holder who says he lost his entire digital fortune to theft. The post captioned a link to a YouTube video by the victim, Brandon, who explained how over $3 million worth of XRP was stolen from his cold wallet. Brandon, a 54-year-old from North Carolina, described himself as cautious, saying he had stored his seed phrase securely and avoided disclosing information online. Despite these measures, his balance of more than 1.2 million XRP vanished within minutes on a Sunday morning. Horrible story. If there’s anyone out there that can help this man please contact him. I just had over $3,000,000 of XRP stolen off of my cold wallet https://t.co/BXohJ89TaD via @YouTube — Digital Asset Investor (@digitalassetbuy) October 18, 2025 How the Theft Occurred In the video , Brandon explained that his assets were held on an Ellipal cold wallet. He said he discovered the theft after checking his balance early in the morning. According to his account, small test transactions were made before nearly all his XRP was moved to a single newly created wallet. Within minutes, those funds were distributed into hundreds of other wallets. He recalled, “I woke up and all my XRP’s been stolen, been hacked.” The loss, he claimed, represents the retirement savings for him and his wife. Brandon noted that while he had small holdings in other assets such as XLM and FLR, only his XRP was taken. The speed and complexity of the transfer suggest the involvement of sophisticated actors . Brandon said he immediately reported the case to the FBI through the IC3 portal and contacted his local sheriff’s department and the State Bureau of Investigation. However, neither had the resources to address a cybercrime of this type . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Challenge of Recovery Brandon’s next steps, as he described them, have been uncertain. He said that online searches led him to companies claiming to specialize in recovering stolen crypto , but he was unsure which ones to trust. Some of these firms requested payment in advance, while others charged high commission fees on any recovered assets. “I read some of them are great. I read some of them they’re all frauds,” he said, reflecting the uncertainty many face after such losses. For now, he continues to await a response from federal authorities. Digital Asset Investor called for any experts available in the community to help recover the stolen funds. Security as a Priority This case serves as a stark reminder of the importance of personal security practices in cryptocurrency custody. While many experts advise investors to hold their XRP in cold wallets , even these systems are vulnerable if any component of their setup is compromised. Brandon’s case shows that security needs more than offline storage, and regular checks and secure firmware are essential.

Data from Dune Analytics shows Robinhood’s tokenized assets now exceed $8.5 million in value at press time. Around $19.3 million worth of tokens have been minted overall, while about $11.5 million have already been burned. Robinhood adds more tokenized stocks for EU users through Arbitrum Dune’s data also tells us that roughly 70% of Robinhood’s on-chain assets are stocks, with another 24% being exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The rest are:- a tiny sliver goes into commodities, crypto-based ETFs, and even US Treasurys. The latest names in Robinhood’s batch for stocks are Galaxy (GLXY), Webull (BULL), and Synopsys (SNPS). Tom Wan, a research analyst who has been tracking the expansion for nearly six months now, said, “Robinhood EU users now have a wider range of US Stocks, Equities, and ETFs, thanks to Tokenization.” Back in June, Cryptopolitan reported that Robinhood built a dedicated Layer-2 blockchain on Arbitrum just for this purpose, to give European users access to tokenized versions of American securities. But these tokens don’t represent direct ownership of the actual stocks. Instead, they’re derivatives, tied to the underlying asset prices but regulated under the MiFID II rulebook (that’s Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II, for those keeping track). The tokens are designed to be cheap and accessible. Robinhood claims there’s no hidden fee beyond a 0.1% FX charge, and you can start trading with as little as 1 euro, about $1.17, and even more, trades are 24/7. But not everyone’s clapping. In July, the Bank of Lithuania, which handles Robinhood’s regulation in the EU, stepped in and asked the company to explain how these tokens are legally structured. Vlad Tenev, the company’s CEO, said they’re open to that kind of review. Robinhood pushes tokenization alongside crypto derivatives and acquisitions The token push comes shortly after Robinhood rolled out micro futures contracts for Bitcoin, XRP, and Solana, dragging crypto deeper into its platform. In May, the company grabbed WonderFi, a Canadian crypto platform, in a deal worth $179 million. The goal is to expand the global reach and add more regulated crypto activity to the platform. Robinhood is also trying to push US regulators to catch up, as the company submitted a full proposal to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), asking for a national framework that would oversee all these real-world asset (RWA) tokens under one consistent set of rules. Even with all that crypto energy, Robinhood’s core business still relies on one thing: trading revenue. Over 50% of its money comes directly from trades, compared to Charles Schwab’s 16%. Schwab makes most of its money from banking products, retirement funds, and advisor fees. That makes Schwab less vulnerable in a downturn. Robinhood, on the other hand, is built around a younger, less wealthy crowd; you know, folks who might bail if things get tight. Robinhood knows that. So, over the past few years, it’s added more traditional financial tools to its platform: retirement portfolios, high-yield savings accounts, and most recently, the acquisition of TradePMR, a network of registered investment advisers. That deal closed earlier this year. Still, its users only hold an average balance of $10,000, which is less than 4% of what Schwab customers typically carry. Get seen where it counts.

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $2.65 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $4.14. Tezos started strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos survive?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis.

The MACD and RSI show weak bullish momentum. A break above $0.60 could target $0.63, while losing $0.55 may deepen the correction. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart Tezos (XTZ) is currently trading around $0.586 on October 19, hovering close to the lower Bollinger Band at $0.542, indicating limited downside room before a possible rebound. The upper Bollinger Band at $0.755 marks the next major resistance, but the middle band at $0.649 poses the first significant hurdle for any upward attempt. The price has been consistently closing below the 20-day moving average, suggesting sustained bearish sentiment. XTZUSDT 1-day price chart | Source: TradingView The MACD histogram remains negative and the signal lines are widening slightly below zero, showing continued bearish pressure, although momentum is weakening slightly. Meanwhile, OBV sits around 1.12B, showing flat volume movement and a lack of fresh accumulation. A breakout above $0.65 could signal the start of a recovery toward $0.70–$0.75. However, failure to hold $0.55 could open the door toward $0.50 in the short term. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart On the 4-hour timeframe, Tezos trades at $0.587, wedged between short-term resistance at $0.593 and local support at $0.584. The Alligator indicator lines remain intertwined, reflecting indecision and a sideways market. XTZUSDT 4-hour price chart | Source: TradingView The RSI at 41.7 shows mild bearishness without being oversold, suggesting the asset still has room to dip slightly before buyers regain control. Price rejection near the $0.60–$0.61 zone indicates a lack of conviction from bulls. If XTZ can close above $0.595, it may attempt to test $0.615–$0.63. Conversely, breaking below $0.584 would likely trigger a retest of $0.56, and possibly $0.55 as seen in the daily chart’s lower band.

Tezos remains range-bound but tilting bearish in the short term. The market may see another dip toward $0.55 before bulls step in for a relief rally toward $0.63–$0.65. Momentum indicators suggest a cautious accumulation phase rather than an aggressive breakout environment. Is Tezos a long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs, so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $2 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance and decentralized applications.

Both Solana (SOL) and SUI are flashing strong bullish divergences on major technical indicators — a classic reversal signal that has historically preceded explosive recoveries. As the Crypto Fear & Greed Index plunges toward multi-month lows near 26 , analysts believe this environment could mark the beginning of a massive accumulation window for those seeking early 2025 exposure. Meanwhile, momentum is quietly building around MAGACOIN FINANCE — an emerging presale project that’s being described by some as a “smart money magnet.” With listings approaching and investor participation surging, the project is drawing comparisons to early-stage altcoins that delivered 50x+ gains in previous market cycles. Solana and SUI Flash Strong Technical Reversal Signals Technical analysts have identified bullish divergences between price action and momentum on both Solana and SUI charts. Solana’s RSI remains flat while price dips lower — a setup that has historically triggered rebounds of over 100%. Likewise, SUI’s MACD is turning upward even as price consolidates, suggesting buying pressure beneath the surface . Whale tracking platforms have also reported rising on-chain accumulation across both tokens, with address growth and stablecoin inflows increasing week over week — a classic sign of institutional repositioning. Fear Index at Bottom Levels — The Opportunity Window The Fear Index hitting the 25–28 zone often signals maximum pessimism in the market, a level that has historically aligned with some of the best long-term entry points. Analysts point out that similar conditions in March 2023 and May 2024 preceded multi-month rallies of over 200% in large-cap altcoins. This pattern — known as the “fear cycle reset” — tends to shift market control from retail panic sellers to long-term accumulators. As sentiment resets, early-stage assets frequently see the largest percentage gains as liquidity rotates downward. MAGACOIN FINANCE Captures Smart Money Attention While traders look for rebound opportunities in established names, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly emerging as one of the most closely watched presale plays of 2025. The project has seen rapid investor growth in recent weeks, supported by verified audits , expanding social engagement, and heightened anticipation around its upcoming exchange listings . Analysts note that MAGACOIN FINANCE’s growing momentum reflects a familiar pattern — where early presale tokens become smart money accumulation targets ahead of major market reversals. Many now view it as a contrarian play — one that could mirror the breakout trajectories of 2021-era low-cap winners once price discovery begins. Analysts Predict 30x ROI Potential With Solana, SUI, and MAGACOIN FINANCE showing strength at the height of fear, analysts believe the next leg higher could deliver outsized returns. Historical models indicate that coins flashing bullish divergences at RSI lows often deliver 20x–30x ROI during the first half of a new cycle. As capital begins rotating from defensive holdings into growth-focused assets, traders are now positioning early — with Solana , SUI , and MAGACOIN FINANCE standing out as top contenders for the next exponential move.

According to his latest post and accompanying video analysis, XRP has just replicated a technical setup identical to the one that preceded its last 600% move. He suggested that while many traders are preoccupied with Bitcoin’s dominance and short-term volatility, XRP may be entering a phase that will realign market dynamics. In his presentation, Ripple Van Winkle argued that the current correction across major cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin’s sharp drop from recent highs, is part of a broader engineered pattern. He pointed to ongoing liquidations on Binance, which he claimed are removing leveraged positions and redirecting liquidity from Bitcoin into altcoins, especially utility-driven assets such as XRP. He stated that this behavior has been consistent in prior cycles, where institutional money shifts away from Bitcoin at its peak into projects positioned for long-term adoption . EVERYONE MISSED IT — the $XRP chart just *flipped* the entire market. While everyone’s staring at Bitcoin dominance, XRP just printed the same pattern that triggered the last 600% move. Most people won’t see it until it’s already up 5x. pic.twitter.com/kQqAw9Cg1F — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) October 17, 2025 XRP’s Position in the Market Cycle Ripple Van Winkle provided detailed technical observations, identifying $2.10 as a critical support level for XRP. He noted that if XRP maintains that zone and reclaims $2.30 on the daily chart, it would confirm a bear trap and potentially drive a rally toward $2.60 to $2.80. In his view, a breakout above $3.10 would mark a macro reversal, signaling the continuation of the broader upward trend. He also highlighted historical parallels, noting that XRP experienced a nearly identical pattern in July, when a 30% drop was followed by a sharp recovery that doubled the token’s value. The analyst believes a similar move could repeat, provided key technical conditions are met. He emphasized that the shakeout currently unfolding is not a signal of collapse but rather a preparatory stage before the next leg higher, mirroring previous market rotations. Broader Market and Bitcoin Outlook Regarding Bitcoin , Ripple Van Winkle observed that the asset remains in a larger uptrend on higher time frames, though the recent daily lower low has broken short-term structure. He expects Bitcoin to eventually target between $140,000 and $170,000, possibly even reaching $200,000 once the liquidation phase subsides. Until then, he said the $104,000 zone remains a pivotal level, where market sentiment shifts from panic to accumulation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He described the current volatility as a “controlled liquidation,” engineered to exhaust over-leveraged traders before the next upward phase. As long as Bitcoin remains above its long-term support, he maintained that this period represents an accumulation opportunity rather than the end of the cycle. XRP Remains Technically Bullish Ripple Van Winkle concluded that XRP’s structure remains technically bullish, with higher highs and higher lows maintained since June. He views the recent retracement as a healthy reset rather than a breakdown. According to his analysis, a confirmed reversal above $2.30 could rapidly propel XRP back toward the $4 range once macro resistance levels are cleared. He added that the capital rotation from Bitcoin to altcoins typically marks the transition into the strongest segment of a bull cycle. If this pattern continues, he believes XRP may be positioned to outperform once again. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Addressing DeFi developers, Storm asked , “How can you be certain that the DOJ will not charge you as a money service business for building a non-custodial protocol?” With the growing uncertainties in the ecosystem, the founder warned that the DOJ could possibly create a case against them. This was after he argued that any decentralized, non-custodial service might have been established as a custodial service under regulatory scrutiny. Notably, Storm pointed out that this situation is similar to what he encountered earlier, as he referred to his recent motion for acquittal, which he submitted on September 30. Storm’s legal case raises concerns among the crypto community Following his court filings, Storm mentioned that his company cannot make any adjustments or alter the Tornado Cash protocol . According to him, the crypto program is a decentralized software protocol that no one entity or actor can manage. The Tornado Cash founder’s remarks came after he was declared guilty in August on one out of three allegations: the jury accused him of conspiring to operate a money transmission business without a license. This followed the US District Court for the Southern District of New York’s ruling that Storm was guilty of one felony charge related to his engagement with Tornado Cash, according to reports from Inner City Press. The ruling caused tension in the crypto ecosystem by raising legal concerns among open-source software developers and sending shockwaves through the crypto community. After the verdict, legal experts discussed whether US prosecutors would pursue charges against Storm for money laundering allegations and sanctions in a new trial. The jury, however, got stuck during their discussion and could not find a common ground on those accusations. They could only find Storm guilty of the unlicensed money transmitter charge. Although Strom has not yet been sentenced, reliable sources have highlighted that other crypto-related cases, like those involving OneCoin co-founder Karl Greenwood and former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, were tried in the same district. Both the executives were found guilty and are now serving time in prison. Recently, the Ethereum Foundation partnered with the Keyring network to fund the legal defense of Tornado Cash developers Roman Storm and Alexey Pertsev. As part of the initiative, all proceeds from Keyring’s zkVerified vaults, a yield-generating product on the Ethereum mainnet, will be used to support the legal defense of the two developers. For the next two months, 100% of protocol fees collected from the vaults will be directed to the legal fund. A statement on the defense legal fund’s landing page noted, “This is a joint effort with the Ethereum Foundation’s Funding Coordination Team to protect developers who build privacy-preserving technology.” Matthew Galeotti calls for clear methods in creating laws Regarding Storm’s case, the chief legal officer at Variant Fund, Jake Chervinsky, shared an X post pointing out that the Trump administration aims to position the US as the crypto capital of the world. With this goal in place, Chervinsky argues that it is inappropriate for the DOJ to retry any charges that caused a deadlock. In response to the chief legal officer’s statement, Matthew Galeotti, who is currently serving as the acting assistant attorney general for the DOJ’s criminal division, released a report dated August stating that the DOJ will not pursue a retrial of Storm and would not be moving forward on any other such cases. Speaking to the crowd at the American Innovation Project Summit, an event supporting regulatory reform and pro-crypto laws in the US, Galeotti expressed that they believe merely writing code without bad intentions is not a crime. He further highlighted that the department will not use indictments to develop laws. “We should not leave innovators uncertain about what could result in criminal charges,” he added.

According to Kranz, these assets carry all the risks associated with central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), as well as additional, unique vulnerabilities of their own. Kranz refers to privately issued stablecoins as a “central business digital currency.” Based on his explanation, they include similar monitoring features, backdoors, programmability, and controls in CBDCs. Jeremy Kranz warns of risks associated with stablecoins When asked to elaborate, Kranz noted that central business digital currencies and stablecoins are essentially alike. To illustrate this, the founder of Sentinel Global provided an example, explaining that if JP Morgan developed a dollar-pegged stablecoin and managed it under laws such as the Patriot Act or any future regulations , they could decide to freeze one’s funds or stop them from utilizing banking services. Kranz also mentioned that stablecoin issuers who provide more collateral than necessary and acquire their blockchain tokens using cash and short-term government securities could encounter “bank runs” if many holders attempt to cash in their tokens simultaneously. Additionally, he observed that algorithmic and synthetic stablecoins rely on software or complex transactions to maintain their value in relation to the dollar. Based on his explanation, this move introduces risks, such as increasing the likelihood of losing that connection amid situations like market volatility or sudden declines in crypto derivative markets. Kranz’s remarks followed his perspective that technology is a neutral tool that can either assist in creating an enhanced financial future for individuals or be misused. According to him, the outcomes depend on individual investors taking the time to read the details, evaluating the risks, and making a prudent choice regarding their financial products. Considering the effects the swift development of stablecoins, crypto, and tokenization technologies brings about, Kranz likened the development to being “10 black swan events” because these advancements bring both chances and dangers. The GENIUS stablecoin bill faces criticism from several US lawmakers DeFiLlama recently released data showing that the total market value of stablecoins rose above $300 billion in October. This demonstrated growing interest in stablecoin following the announcement that the US passed its GENIUS stablecoin bill in July. This was after the US Senate voted 68-30 to approve the GENIUS Act, around six weeks after Tennessee Senator Bill Hagerty introduced it. With this remarkable announcement, sources have highlighted the increasing likelihood that the House of Representatives may soon review the STABLE Act, the bill’s companion, which may undergo various adjustments before a final vote. Notably, the STABLE Act and the GENIUS Act aim to regulate stablecoins. Regarding the approval of the GENIUS Act, lawmakers received the announcement with mixed reactions. An example of these lawmakers is Marjorie Taylor Greene , a representative from Georgia. Greene referred to the bill as a CBDC Trojan Horse. She further shared an X post dated July 15, stating that this bill regulates stablecoins while creating a backdoor for a central bank digital currency. “The Federal Reserve has been planning for years to develop a CBDC, and this will lead us toward a cashless society with digital currency that an authoritarian government could use against you by controlling your ability to trade,” Greene added.

ChatGPT Issues a Stark XRP Warning,https://cryptopotato.com/up-or-down-for-ripples-price-in-the-week-ahead-chatgpt-issues-a-stark-xrp-warning/,"The cryptocurrency market was crushed in the past week or so, and Ripple’s native token is no exception. Even if we remove the black swan flash crash that took it below $1 on some exchanges last Friday, the asset’s price performance has been quite painful and is about to close the week with another double-digit decline. However, there might be even more pain on the horizon, at least according to ChatGPT. What’s Next for XRP? XRP has come a long way from the mid-summer rally when it exploded from $2.20 to $3.65 to register a new all-time high. Since then, it’s declined by nearly 40% and has dropped by two spots in the ranking of the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. ChatGPT outlined the predominantly negative sentiment in the cryptocurrency community, as its leader remains “dominant and volatile,” while other alts, like ETH and BNB, have coped better than XRP. In fact, it said Ripple’s token is “lagging hard,” which suggests “a rotation away from slower-moving assets.” Consequently, its prediction for the week is not favorable to the XRP Army. It outlined the first strong resistance levels, at $2.20 and $2.10, which could prevent a potential drop to $2, even though some analysts believe XRP “wants” to go there. If it indeed slips to that line, it should face a stronger support, which was formed in the spring of 2025. In case of an unlikely price reversal, XRP’s first resistance targets lie at $2.40-$2.50, followed by a bigger hurdle at $2.80. Bears Still Hold on Tight After a 19% weekly decline and a 24% monthly drop, it isn’t easy to be bullish. Consequently, ChatGPT put the highest chances for a bearish continuation in the week ahead (45%-50% probability). It broached the aforementioned support levels, and said XRP must maintain $2.00 to avoid another possible nosedive to $1.60. Although it asserted that the bears are most likely to remain in control, it also outlined the possibility of a tactical rebound following such a massive correction. According to the AI chatbot, there’s a 35% probability for such a bounce to somewhere around $2.50 and $2.60. Interestingly, it believes the chances for a price stabilization at these levels (between $2.10 and $2.40) are the slimmest. With a 15% to 20% probability, ChatGPT ranked this as the least likely option for the next seven days. “The momentum and sentiment both lean bearish, but the setup looks technically oversold. Base case: mild continuation lower early in the week, followed by potential stabilization near $2.00. Unless Ripple announces a major development (e.g., RLUSD expansion, new exchange partnership, or institutional pilot), a strong recovery next week is unlikely,” it concluded.

The memecoin reaches a crucial point when technical indicators suggest that a significant price movement can follow the accumulation. Price Structure Shows Resilience Despite Pullback DOGE is now at a lower price, below 0.382 Fibonacci retracement difference at 0.215, which can be considered the first level of resistance to the new bullish price movement. The coin has defended the support zone of $0.151 on multiple occasions in 2025, making this support zone a dependable floor for the price action. Fibonacci retracement. Source: X The 9.7% drop this week has failed to end the higher-low trend that has defined the present market formation. The price is higher than the previous cycle lows, which is a confidence boost for long-term holders. Analyst Cantonese Cat stresses the need to recover the threshold of $0.215. Bulls would be back in control when a weekly close over this resistance is reached and would be likely to initiate a push towards the next Fibonacci extensions of $0.27 and $0.31. Source: X The battlefield of DOGE has been shifted to the range of $0.151 and 0.215. Any breach of support would be welcome to more profound combinations, and a consistent trend above resistance will provide opportunities for higher valuations. Trade activity has been shrinking, especially since the mid-2025 peak. The trends in volume indicate that participation is also decreasing, and there is little new capital flowing into the market. This is usually an indication of consolidation, rather than distribution. The low volume has not been historic, so one may not want to assume it is strictly bearish. Past rallies of Dogecoin in 2023 and 2024 were the result of such periods of silence. The explosive moves were usually preceded by long periods of inactivity, which made the traders unprepared when they encountered the reality of buying pressure. The recent decline to $0.17 was met with an immediate purchasing action, indicating active support at the important technical levels. This pattern is a recreation of recovery trends in the success reversals of 2024. The short-term weakness is not neutralised because there are no lower lows to spoil the medium-term outlook. Broader Market Context Influences DOGE Performance The slow performance of Dogecoin is indicative of the sluggish marketplace for altcoins. Bitcoin dominance is elevated because investors are preferring more traditional investments due to distrust of macro conditions. The tightening of the global money system and reduced liquidity have suppressed risk appetite in cryptocurrency markets. On-chain measures tell a different story. User interest remains very strong, indicating that it persists despite a price stagnation. It is generally price action divergence and network activity divergence that are characteristic of accumulation zones, rather than distribution events. DOGE remains a high-beta asset, which predisposes the company to greater volatility as soon as the market situation improves. As a hypothetical asset with high levels of community support, Dogecoin has historically performed disproportionately well as liquidity returns to the cryptocurrency market. The technical foundation remains constructive. Higher lows continue to form while critical support remains firm. This structure provides the framework for potential upside once catalysts emerge. Traders now watch for volume confirmation and a break above $0.215, which would validate the next leg higher.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|DOGE|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-19 06:14:17

The recent decline is part of a larger downward trend in the cryptocurrency market, which drove Bitcoin down to $103,856 on Friday. Still, Satoshi remains one of the richest people worldwide, ranking above Alice Walton and Michael Bloomberg in wealth standings, according to Arkham Intelligence. Nakamoto still has Bitcoin worth over $117 billion Data from Arkham Intelligence shows that Nakamoto holds more than 1 million Bitcoin , currently worth around $117.5 billion. When Bitcoin soared to an all-time high above $126,000 in the first week of October, his portfolio had ballooned to roughly $136 billion. Although analysts have pointed out that, unlike other preloaded Bitcoin wallets which have seen activity, addresses related to Satoshi’s mining operation remain completely dormant. The coins have never been moved, leading many to speculate that the private keys are lost or that Satoshi himself may no longer be living. Bitcoin’s steep drop has been tied to the escalating geopolitical tensions between Washington and Beijing. Markets tumbled after President Trump announced 100% tariffs on Chinese imports, from tech products to rare earth minerals, sparking a flight from risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. As earlier reported by Cryptopolitan , the market crash resulted in $20 billion in liquidations in under one day, the largest in crypto’s history. In the aftermath, prices of coins plunged, and some altcoins lost more than 99% of their value. Still, Bitcoin held firm at $100,000 range. Between October 10 and 11, data from Coinglass shows that over $19.3 billion in leveraged positions were wiped out, representing the biggest liquidation event in crypto history. Longs made up $711.24 million of the total liquidations, while shorts accounted for $308.30 million. Analysts said the downturn deepened due to light weekend trading and panic selling by retail investors. Fear spread quickly on social media, prompting rushed exits, though some traders seized the moment to take profits and trim risk, helping prices stabilize afterward. So far, analysts from The Kobeissi Letter have explained that the October 8 market crash is merely a short-term pullback and not indicative of deeper structural issues. They posted : “We believe this crash was due to the combination of multiple sudden technical factors. It does NOT have long-term fundamental implications. A technical correction was overdue, we think a trade deal will be reached, and crypto remains strong.” Arkham data indicates that one trader earned $192 million Large holders did take advantage of the market swings. Arkham data shows one such trader pocketed $192 million from short positions ahead of the collapse. The whale has allegedly re-entered the market with a fresh $163 million short position on the DeFi platform Hyperliquid. The $209 million leveraged short, according to on-chain analysis, highlights sustained bearish positioning by whales. However, experts warned that risky positions like these could drive market swings in the near term amid expectations of continued volatility. A Polymarket bet on Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, saw a plunge to 6% after a sudden rise on Oct. 15. The bet “Will Satoshi move any Bitcoin in 2025?” spiked 15% for a while before tumbling down. This sudden rise and fall incident led some traders to lose their positions. According to Polymarket data, one trader by the username 1897sadhjns444dpoasdp speculated over $13,000 on “Yes” at an average price of 10 cents a share. They saw their current value drop by nearly 46%, experiencing a deficit of $11,057. Similarly, a different user, arfdgsdfq , who bet the same at 11 cents per share, saw their position dive down over 52%, resulting in a loss of $16,583 in a single month.

This overlooked gem could hold the potential to drive the next wave of institutional on-chain activity. Dive into the latest developments and discover which coins might be poised for significant growth. Injective (INJ) Shows Potential in a Volatile Market Source: tradingview Injective (INJ) is currently priced between seven and twelve dollars. The coin has seen a drop this past week and month. Despite this, there's hope for a bounce back. Its closest resistance is around sixteen dollars, with an even higher level at just over twenty. If it pushes past its current range, INJ could rise significantly. The short-term average price is about eight dollars, so breaking past that could signal growth. Even though recent changes show declines, the potential gains could be impressive if it reaches its resistance levels, offering increases of around forty to eighty percent. Keep an eye out for how INJ handles this volatile phase. Conclusion As the Injective ecosystem grows, its potential becomes more evident. INJ could be instrumental in driving the next wave of institutional interest in DeFi. The platform's ability to integrate and innovate makes it a significant player to watch. With increasing adoption and development, Injective has the components needed to support and possibly lead the next phase of on-chain growth.

CRV, AAVE, and LINK appear to be gaining traction among investors. The current trends suggest these tokens might be poised for growth. Enthusiasts and investors alike would do well to keep a close eye on these developments and consider the potential for future gains. Mantle (MNT) Faces Price Struggle but Holds Growth Potential Source: tradingview Mantle (MNT) is experiencing a bumpy ride with its current price sitting between $1.31 and $3.03. The coin has seen a recent dip, falling over 33% in the past week. However, it still boasts a significant rise of more than 135% over six months. The nearest resistance level lies at $3.81, which, if surpassed, could be a positive sign for investors. The RSI is low, suggesting it might be oversold, hinting at a possible rebound. If MNT manages to break past the second resistance level of $5.52, we could see substantial growth, potentially increasing by over 80% from its present upper range. Aave Eyes Potential Growth After Recent Dip Source: tradingview Currently, Aave is navigating a price range between $122 and over $340. Despite a recent dip of around 24% in one week and a 30% drop over the past month, Aave has shown resilience with a strong six-month growth of nearly 47%. The coin is hovering far below its resistance mark of roughly $431. If it manages to surpass this, the next target is about $650. The current trends, factoring in a low Relative Strength Index of just under 26, hint at potential upside for Aave as it remains undervalued. With the market slowly correcting, Aave could aim to climb toward its higher resistance points for substantial gains. Chainlink (LINK) Shows Potential Despite Recent Price Slump Source: tradingview Chainlink (LINK) is currently trading between a tad over $10 and almost $26. The past month has seen a dip of nearly 30%, and almost 25% just in the last week. However, there is room for optimism. The current price is below both the short and long-term moving averages, indicating it could bounce back. If LINK hits the first resistance level of $32, it could result in a rise by around 50%. Further growth towards the second resistance level of $48 would mean nearly doubling its low-end current price. The coin’s RSI and stochastic levels suggest the market might soon see buying interest, triggering a possible upward movement. Conclusion CRV, AAVE, and LINK are showing signs of increased interest from buyers. This early accumulation suggests positive movement. If these trends continue, there could be potential for growth in their values. Investors paying attention might see opportunities for gains. These coins are worth watching closely in the coming weeks. Their performance may hint at a broader trend in the market. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The rising bearish sentiment within NEAR Protocol’s community is bringing a cautious approach among traders. As NEAR continues to advance its technology and forge strategic partnerships, questions surrounding its price potential persist, inviting further analysis and exploration of its prospects.

NEAR protocol price is expected to cross the $20 threshold by 2031 This supports the long term forecast as the industry continues to see increasing adoption across the mainstream. The bullish rally will be supported by NEAR’s vision of a scalable future and user and developer-friendly architecture that sets it apart from other blockchains. Will NEAR reach $50? The chance of NEAR protocol price reaching the $50 mark depends on various circumstances, such as future network development, market regulations, and the broader cryptocurrency market growth. If NEAR continues its current trajectory, it can reach $50 in the next several years. Does NEAR have a good long term future? Yes, NEAR has a good long-term future due to its innovative technology, focus on scalability and strong ecosystem development, which supports a favorable price prediction.

NEAR Protocol historic price sentiment NEAR price history The Near Protocol (NEAR) began its journey in August 2020, aiming to create a scalable and permissionless blockchain. The first recorded trade value in October 2020 was $1.072, closing the year at $1.459 after a recovery. In 2021, NEAR showed an uptrend, starting at $1.305 and reaching an all-time high (ATH) of $7.572 by March 13. A market downturn pushed the price down to $1.537 by July 19, but it rebounded to $11.776 on September 9 and further to $13.168 on October 26. By 2022, NEAR’s price crashed to below $2.00, losing over 90% of its peak value. Throughout 2023, NEAR saw low volatility, with prices remaining below $2.50 for most of the year. Since the start of 2024, NEAR has experienced a strong recovery, climbing to $7.80. However, after reaching the $8.00 mark in mid-May, it fell back to $5.60. In June, NEAR traded between $4.48 and $7.66. It rose from $5.20 to $6.04 in July but closed the month below $5.00. NEAR started August at $5.00, declining to $3.89 by the end of the month. In September 2024, the asset bounced back and closed the month above the $5.20 mark. In October, the price stumbled and fell to $4.850 in the first few days before closing the month below the $4.00 mark leaving a negative outlook at the start of November. November saw NEAR making remarkable strides as the bulls held strong control of markets during the month, a trend that was expected to continue into December. However, the month saw NEAR plummet from heights of $7.00 to fall below $5 before closing the month. In January the price could not find a stable foothold and the price continued dwindling, closing the month just above $4.00 In February the price fell significantly towards the $3.00 mark and continued to decline ending the month at $2.80. In March the price continued to decline ending the month near $2.50, a trend that continued in April ending the month at $2.35. In May the price recovered but only to the extent of reversing April’s losses as the month ended below $2.50. June saw further decay as despite the early bullish signals, bears dominated the month and NEAR closed the month around $2.12. In mid-July, the price of NEAR Protocol surged toward the high of $3 but it started to decay in the later half of the month, a trend that continued in August with NEAR closing the month at $2.38. In September, the price rose sharply to the $3.40 mark but failed to maintain the level ending the month at $3.00",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|NEAR|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-19 06:36:07

This surge sparks speculation about whether the meme coin mania has returned. Dive into the article to uncover which coins are poised for growth and what this trend means for the market. In an environment of constant change, where narratives and focuses shift rapidly, the ability to intervene promptly and maintain visibility is crucial. This underscores why data-driven agencies such as Outset PR do more than just track token prices; they also monitor the broader media landscape. The Outset Data Pulse reporting intelligence offers up-to-date insights into crypto media performance, significantly boosting the effectiveness of PR campaigns. Pepe (PEPE) Shows Struggles but Hints at Potential Upside Source: tradingview Pepe (PEPE) is currently priced between a fraction of a cent, finding its footing after a notable drop of nearly 30% in just one week. Over the past month, the coin's value has decreased by over 40%. The current moving averages suggest the price is under some pressure, with a 10-day average below the longer-term 100-day figure. The RSI indicates that the coin is edging into oversold territory, suggesting room for a bounce. Should an upward movement occur, Pepe could aim for its first resistance level at $0.00001443, offering a potential rise of over 100%. However, breaking through would open even higher targets.

It builds strategies based on both retrospective and real-time metrics, which helps to obtain results with a long-lasting effect. Outset PR replaces vague promises with concrete plans tied to perfect publication timing, narratives that emphasize the product-market fit, and performance-based media selection.

This is PR with a personal touch, where strategy feels handcrafted and every client gets a solution that fits. Outset PR’s secret weapon is its exclusive traffic acquisition tech and internal media analytics. Proprietary Tech That Powers Performance One of Outset PR’s most impactful tools is its in-house user acquisition system. It fuses organic editorial placements with SEO and lead-generation tactics, enabling clients to appear in high-discovery surfaces and drive multiples more traffic than through conventional PR alone.

Case in point: The careful selection of media outlets has helped Outset PR increase user engagement for Step App in the US and UK markets. Outset PR Engineers Visibility That Fits the Market One of the biggest pain points in Web3 PR is the disconnect between effort and outcome: generic messaging, no product-market alignment, and media hits that generate visibility but leave business impact undefined. Outset PR addresses this by offering customized solutions. Every campaign begins with a thorough research and follows a clearly mapped path from spend to the result. It's data-backed and insight-driven with just the right level of boutique care. Dogecoin's Price Dips with Hopes for Future Bounce Source: tradingview Dogecoin is trading between 11 and 28 cents. It's been a rough month, with prices dropping over 32%. But there's hope. If it moves past 36 cents, it could jump to 54 cents, about 50% higher from its current range. The coin's value is showing a slight recovery from a six-month rise of nearly 17%. Though short-term indicators are low, Dogecoin fans are optimistic. As it sits below the 10-day and 100-day moving averages, breaking past 36 cents could open doors for significant growth. Keep an eye on support at around 2 cents to gauge its stability. Bitcoin Shows Potential for Growth Despite Recent Dip Source: tradingview Bitcoin's current price fluctuates between the low $106K to just under $125K, showing some volatility. Despite a recent downturn of nearly 13% over the past week, Bitcoin has experienced a positive climb of around 24% over the past six months. The market suggests potential growth, with the next resistance level near $134K. If Bitcoin breaks this, it might aim for the $152K mark, representing a significant potential rise from today's range. The support level sits just under $98K, providing a safety net. While recent dips test investors' nerves, past trends hint at potential upward movement. Conclusion PEPE and DOGE have shown strong gains while BTC remains stable. This suggests renewed interest in meme coins. The rising prices of PEPE and DOGE could attract more traders and investors. Bitcoin's steady performance provides a stable background for this trend. The current market behavior hints that the meme coin craze might be making a comeback. With BTC holding steady, the focus may shift to these popular and playful cryptocurrencies. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The token's price reaches a critical threshold, sparking curiosity among investors. This article delves into the factors at play and examines other cryptocurrencies primed for growth. Readers will uncover the current market dynamics and what could happen next for this intriguing digital asset. In today's rapidly changing landscape, marked by evolving narratives and shifting priorities, the ability to intervene promptly and maintain visibility is paramount. This underscores why data-driven agencies like Outset PR extend their focus beyond simply tracking token prices to encompass the broader media environment. The Outset Data Pulse reporting intelligence offers up-to-date insights into crypto media performance, significantly boosting the effectiveness of PR campaigns. Hyperliquid (HYPE) Struggles but Shows Long-Term Potential Source: tradingview Hyperliquid (HYPE) is currently priced between $24.03 and $52.47. It faces resistance at $65, while support sits at $8.42. Recently, HYPE has dropped 19.35% over the past week and 34.89% this past month. However, over six months, it has surged by about 96%. The 10-day average is roughly $35, indicating short-term struggles, while the 100-day average of nearly $39 suggests potential for recovery. With a relative strength index close to 43, HYPE has room to grow before hitting overbought levels. Watching its resistance at $65 and potential rise toward $94 could see gains pushing toward 80%, suggesting a long-term positive picture despite recent dips. Presenting Yourself Without Overspending: How Outset PR Optimizes PR Budgets and Delivers Tangible Results The purpose of any PR campaign is to boost brand visibility. Traditionally, this has meant securing as many publications as possible, often with unpredictable outcomes. It was difficult to know how many readers would actually see a story, leaving much of PR to guesswork. Actually, it had been guesswork until analysts of Outset PR developed Syndication Map —a proprietary tool that identifies which outlets attract the most traffic and where a story is likely to achieve the strongest syndication lift. Senior Media Analyst Maximilian Fondé explains: If a company needs a top list article, we filter the table for media that publish this format, cross-check costs and placement conditions, and know within minutes which outlets to pitch. Over time, that builds into a comprehensive database of crypto-friendly publishers – something other players in the industry don't have right now. Smarter Campaigns, Lower Costs Campaigns built with Syndication Map are not about mass reach for its own sake. They are carefully crafted to serve specific goals. By narrowing the focus to the most effective outlets, Outset PR reduces unnecessary spending on low-impact publications. Another key factor is communication. Outset PR’s dedicated Media Relations team, led by Anastasia Anisimova , has earned the trust of leading outlets through professionalism and genuine relationships. Sincerity and friendliness are our core principles, earning us the trust of numerous media outlets. Unfortunately, not all agencies in our industry prioritize friendliness in their communications. Extended Reach Through Syndication Outset PR campaigns also achieve more visibility than clients initially pay for. Articles are frequently republished across aggregators and platforms such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square, extending exposure far beyond the original placement. Well-placed articles can achieve up to ten times the outreach of the original post. The case of StealthEX demonstrates this effect clearly: targeted tier-1 pitching led to 92 republications across outlets including CoinMarketCap, Binance Square, and Yahoo Finance, generating a total outreach of over 3 billion. Outset PR Sets a New Standard Pitching to a major outlet like Cointelegraph still has value, but syndication often delivers far greater reach at a lower cost. Outset PR has mastered this strategy, combining proprietary tools, strong media relations, and syndication opportunities to deliver results backed by numbers. Conclusion The market shows that HYPE is facing a critical barrier. Current trends indicate difficulty breaking through this resistance level. Until then, sideways movement might persist. Investors should watch for key price movements. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Polymarket’s latest tweet has injected a fresh dose of skepticism into the Bitcoin narrative. The decentralized prediction market humorously noted that the odds of aliens being confirmed this year (6%) slightly surpass Bitcoin hitting $200,000 (5%). Yet beneath the levity, Polymarket’s data highlighted a more serious near-term risk. Market Panic Polymarket is seeing a 52% chance that Bitcoin could crash below $100,000 this month. This is in line with the broader market unease, as crypto analyst Ted Pillow recently stated that Bitcoin has already lost its critical $108,000 support level, which has left a minimal buffer until $101,000-$102,000. Pillow stated that a reclaim of $110,000 could trigger a short-term bounce, but otherwise, traders should brace for more pain before relief arrives. Adding to the cautionary sentiment, Doctor Profit, another popular market analyst, called the current environment the “early phase of the bear market,” which is seeing intense deceptive mini-rallies and sharp downside moves. He predicted the macro bottom would eventually settle between $60,000-$70,000. According to Doctor Profit, traders should expect increasing selling pressure, with the Fear & Greed Index likely reaching extreme fear levels in the coming days, further backed by the red numbers across the charts. As such, these factors paint a picture of a market navigating a precarious balance. “Remember, dead cat bounces are the biggest enemy for us shorts. Play them or ignore them, but don’t fight them.” Defensive Stance Macro uncertainty continues to weigh heavily on Bitcoin, and Glassnode revealed a major change in sentiment across markets and derivatives. Over the past week, gold has outperformed Bitcoin by more than 20%, reclaiming part of its “store-of-value” appeal. This was indicative of investors’ growing caution toward crypto. This caution has spilled over into the options market. Short-dated BTC volatility spiked sharply overnight, while front-end options traded around 50 vol as traders paid up for immediate downside protection. BTC skew still behaves like a macro asset, favoring puts – downside protection remains pricier than upside exposure amidst defensive positioning. The market is balanced, as seen with some accounts rolling protection lower, others selling volatility on the dip, and a few selectively buying cheap calls. Overall, the tone is cautious but not one-sided. Broader volatility metrics confirm this defensiveness. Put-heavy skew, bid wing vols, and strong demand for tail hedges indicate traders remain focused on downside risk. Year-end upside exposure has cooled as downside vol continues to dominate. For those willing to take risks, selling puts or put spreads to finance November topside remains a viable strategy.

The page, titled “XRP Demand Examined,” outlines how Ripple structured its approach on the premise that adoption of its protocol would create sustained demand for XRP, leading to appreciation in its value. The document specifies that Ripple Labs’ model is based on the belief that “demand for XRP will increase (resulting in price appreciation) if the Ripple protocol becomes widely adopted.” It further states that for XRP to experience organic demand, rather than speculative interest, the asset must provide genuine utility to its holders. According to the excerpt, XRP’s two core functions are maintaining network security and serving as a bridge currency for cross-ledger transfers. RIPPLE’S BUSINESS MODEL RELIES ON THE IDEA THAT DEMAND FOR XRP WILL INCREASE ITS PRICE Documented. pic.twitter.com/EXroOhReWO — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) October 18, 2025 Focus on Real Usage Over Speculation The section describes how XRP’s role in securing the network is achieved through mechanisms that impose small costs on spam or denial-of-service attacks. Each transaction burns a minute amount of XRP, while network reserves and transaction fees act as deterrents against abuse. These measures, the document notes, ensure system reliability and promote efficient processing of legitimate transactions. In the same segment, Ripple emphasizes that value appreciation is not expected to occur by default or through speculative behavior, but through increasing adoption of the protocol and sustained usage of XRP for its intended functions. This approach underscores that market value is secondary to real-world integration and network participation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community Reaction to the Researcher’s Post In the discussions that followed the researcher’s post, several community members pointed out the significance of Ripple’s wording. One user stated that real adoption and demand drive the network, not just speculation, while another, Cedric Beau, highlighted that the document proves XRP’s price potential is conditional on actual utility. He noted that Ripple clearly differentiates between speculation and organic demand, stressing that if XRP is not used at scale, appreciation cannot occur. The resurfaced document reinforces a long-standing position that Ripple’s success is tied to measurable use cases and integration rather than assumptions of price movement. XRP’s demand, according to Ripple’s own materials, must stem from its functions as a security mechanism and a bridge asset. For observers and market participants, the message remains consistent: network activity and adoption determine demand, and therefore any expectation of long-term appreciation is tied directly to utility.

Measuring Real ROI in 2025’s Crypto PR Environment,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/10/are-press-releases-still-worth-it-measuring-real-roi-in-2025s-crypto-pr-environment,"For years, crypto founders have asked the same question: “Are press releases still worth the spend?”Once the default PR weapon, the press release has evolved into a niche tool — one that only delivers results when used strategically and measured correctly. In 2025, value isn’t in distribution volume but in data-backed visibility. Reach alone means nothing without engagement, sentiment, and search impact. The era of “spray and pray” is over — what matters now is understanding where your message travels, how it converts, and what credibility it builds over time. For a broader perspective on this shift, see our main article on why crypto press releases still drive real results . 1. The End of Vanity Metrics Open rates, impressions, and headline counts once dominated reporting decks — but these numbers tell little about real influence. In crypto, where attention moves fast and credibility is fragile, PR success can’t be reduced to exposure alone. Instead, focus on behavioral metrics — the ones that show real engagement and intent. Old PR Metrics Modern PR ROI Indicators Number of publications Referral traffic from earned media Impressions / reach Branded keyword growth Press release pickups Engagement rate & time-on-page Publication count Sentiment score (positive vs negative mentions) Social shares Conversions from tracked PR URLs These new metrics paint a clearer picture: not how loud your message was, but how deeply it resonated. 2. The Rise of Reputation Analytics Visibility is temporary; reputation is compounding.Modern PR tools like Meltwater, Brand24, or LunarCrush allow teams to track not only mentions but also sentiment, authority, and share-of-voice. A release that sparks positive discussion on X, Reddit, or in major crypto outlets yields more ROI than dozens of reposts on syndication sites.The real win comes when journalists and analysts start referencing your brand without being pitched — that’s the clearest indicator of organic trust. 3. SEO Value: The Silent ROI Multiplier In crypto PR, search presence is the invisible return most teams overlook. Every quality backlink from a credible outlet reinforces domain authority and keyword relevance.A press release distributed via high-authority channels like CoinTelegraph, Yahoo Finance, or Benzinga becomes a long-term visibility asset. While the traffic may not spike instantly, the SEO footprint strengthens your discoverability for months.Simply put: a well-indexed story can outlive a viral tweet — and often convert better. 4. Conversion-Based Impact Ultimately, ROI means results. A successful PR campaign doesn’t end at publication — it tracks how coverage drives user actions. To measure real PR ROI in crypto , focus on: Tracking referral traffic from earned media and news outlets Monitoring sentiment and keyword trends weekly Using UTM codes to link coverage to conversions Comparing engagement before and after major campaigns Evaluating the lifetime SEO value of earned backlinks When PR connects directly to measurable outcomes — like whitelist sign-ups, presale visits, or token page activity — its value becomes indisputable. 5. The Compounding Model of PR ROI One-off announcements rarely move markets. ROI scales with consistency — when your brand appears regularly across trusted publications, social mentions, and thought-leadership channels. Each release adds a layer of familiarity — the psychological foundation of trust.The smartest crypto PR teams think in campaigns, not bursts.Every piece of communication supports the next, turning awareness into authority over time. When Press Releases Are Still Worth It Press releases aren’t obsolete — they’re just more specialized than ever. They still deliver strong ROI when used with purpose and precision. Press releases are worth the investment when: You’re announcing a verified milestone (listing, funding, or partnership) You have data, metrics, or real traction to share The message fits into a coordinated PR campaign The announcement supports an ongoing narrative built through media and community Used this way, a single release becomes the spark — not the entire fire. Conclusion So, are press releases still worth it?

The premier cryptocurrency is presently displaying some stability following another volatile trading week, which produced a 3.41% price loss. Notably, Bitcoin’s movement amid this corrective phase has triggered an interesting on-chain signal with bullish implications. Related Reading: Bitcoin May See Selloff If $100,000 Support Fails — Here’s Why Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Go Underwater, But Historical Data Reads Bullish Signs In an X post on October 18, popular market analyst, Ali Martinez, shares an important on-chain development. Amid the recent price decline, Martinez notes that Bitcoin slipped below its short-term holders’ (STH) realized price, creating an ideal situation for a market accumulation based on historical data. For context, the STH realized price represents the average acquisition price of coins held by short-term investors, i.e, wallets that have held BTC for less than 155 days. Typically, when the market price dips below this level, it indicates that new market entrants are underwater, signaling local capitulation and short-term fear in the market Based on the Glassnode data shared by Martinez, Bitcoin fell below its STH realized price on October 14 during its latest price correction. While such developments usually trigger temporary selling pressure, historical data show it has also become a cue for strategic buyers. In particular, the price dip below the STH realized price appears to align with strong rebound points in the market. Notably, the chart above shows four prior instances (May 2023, November 2023, August 2024, and May 2025), where Bitcoin’s descent below the STH realized price was followed by substantial recoveries. Martinez explains that this price dip usually provides a good opportunity for market accumulation, thereby fueling future price rallies. Interestingly, the broader Bitcoin market remains dominated by long-term holders, who are potentially utilizing this price pocket to strengthen their holdings, thus maintaining the present bullish structure.

On-chain data reveals a steady increase in accumulation across large ETH wallets, even as prices hover near multi-month lows around $3,750–$3,800 . Historically, such quiet accumulation phases have marked the early foundation of major bull cycles , signaling that big money is once again positioning ahead of the crowd. Analysts now say the 2025 100x watchlist is taking shape — with Cardano (ADA) and emerging presale project MAGACOIN FINANCE standing out as two of the most promising assets to lead the next wave of exponential returns. Ethereum Whales Accumulate as Retail Confidence Falters While retail traders remain cautious, whale tracking platforms like Santiment and Glassnode show consistent ETH inflows into wallets holding over 10,000 ETH . This silent buying spree mirrors patterns from late 2022 — right before Ethereum rallied more than 200% the following year. Analysts note that whale accumulation during fear-driven markets often signals “the smart money phase” — when patient investors quietly build positions in high-conviction assets while the broader market remains distracted by short-term volatility. Cardano Reclaims a Spot on Analysts’ 2025 100x List Cardano (ADA) , trading near $0.61 , has returned to the spotlight as analysts refresh their 2025 100x potential lists . With staking activity climbing and development metrics reaching record highs, ADA is being re-evaluated as a long-term value play — not just a speculative altcoin. Institutional inflows into ADA-backed products have also picked up, reinforcing the idea that major investors are positioning early for what could become one of the most profitable phases of the next market cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Recognition Among Early 2025 Picks Beyond the established players, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as one of the most discussed early 2025 breakout candidates . The project’s presale has attracted major traction, with tens of thousands of investors participating globally and the allocation phase nearing completion. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart, according to analysts, is its smart-money appeal — a combination of audited transparency, early community expansion, and strategic timing. With exchange listings expected soon , the token is approaching the critical price discovery phase , which historically acts as a springboard for early-stage assets positioned before a bull run. Traders see MAGACOIN FINANCE as a contrarian accumulation play , similar to how early Solana and Cardano investors positioned before their respective 50x–100x breakouts in prior cycles. As liquidity rotates from blue chips to growth-phase assets, MAGACOIN FINANCE could see its next leg of expansion driven by post-listing exposure. Smart Money Rotation Underway Market strategists agree that the coming months will likely define the structure of the next crypto supercycle. As whales accumulate Ethereum, institutions re-enter ADA, and retail investors look for high-upside entries, the 2025 100x list continues to narrow to a handful of standout names — with MAGACOIN FINANCE , Cardano , and Ethereum leading the conversation. If history rhymes, the projects accumulating volume quietly today may become the next generation of outperformers once the market’s next full-scale rally ignites.

A press release by itself rarely moves the needle; its real power appears when it’s embedded into a broader communication system that amplifies visibility, trust, and engagement over time. Press releases were once one-off announcements. Today, they’re strategic anchors — the narrative seeds that feed entire campaigns. If you’ve ever wondered how the role of press releases changed from distribution to integration , our main research on this evolution explains why traditional visibility lost power — and how modern PR rebuilt it through connected storytelling. The Press Release as a Campaign Starter, Not a Standalone A press release works best when it kicks off a chain reaction — not when it’s left to float in isolation. Instead of publishing and walking away, build a multi-channel rollout around it: A short-form thread or infographic for X (Twitter) Founder commentary pieces for crypto outlets A community AMA or Spaces session within 48 hours An internal newsletter or blog recap with context Each touchpoint reinforces the same story from a different angle, turning one release into an evolving conversation. Aligning With Broader PR Objectives Press releases should always connect to your macro PR goals, not just short-term visibility. Before drafting, define what you’re actually trying to achieve: Objective Press Release Focus Follow-Up Action Exchange listing or token launch Transparency, credibility Host AMA + publish metrics recap Partnership announcement Strategic alignment Joint content + influencer collaboration Funding round Validation & traction Founder interview + data storytelling Product update Utility & roadmap progress Community Q&A + how-to content When aligned this way, the press release becomes a trigger event in a bigger narrative — not a disconnected signal. The Media Layer: Extending Lifespan Through Earned Coverage After publication, the goal shifts from “syndication” to amplification. Pitch key journalists, analysts, and community writers with story extensions: “What this partnership means for DeFi adoption” “How this funding reflects market confidence in L2 scaling” These follow-ups turn your press release into earned media, extending its relevance and lifespan. This shift — from chasing quantity to nurturing long-term visibility — mirrors how modern crypto PR redefined credibility , a topic explored in depth in our broader analysis of evolving press release strategy. The Content Layer: Turning One Story into Ten A great press release can fuel an entire content cycle. Here’s how the most effective crypto PR teams repurpose a single announcement: From one press release, you can create: A founder op-ed explaining the story behind it A YouTube explainer or demo videoA Twitter thread breaking down key numbers A case study on your website showing early results A media kit update for investor outreach This is content compounding — using the same core asset across multiple contexts to maximize exposure and retention. The Community Layer: Driving Organic Discussion Once the official announcement drops, communities become your best amplifiers. Encourage members to repost, comment, and react — but more importantly, give them a reason to. Offer early access, AMAs, or exclusive insights to community channels like Telegram, Discord, or Lens. When community members feel involved in your milestones, their engagement becomes authentic PR — the kind that can’t be bought or automated. Analytics & Optimization: Measuring the Full Campaign Impact When a press release is part of a coordinated campaign, analytics reveal a much richer ROI picture. Measure across three layers: Direct impact: referral traffic, sign-ups, token page visits Amplified impact: secondary coverage, backlinks, influencer mentions Compounding impact: branded search growth and sentiment over time Modern PR isn’t about guessing — it’s about learning from data loops. Each campaign iteration improves the next, creating a continuous feedback system that compounds reputation and reach. Integration Checklist Before your next press release goes live, ensure it’s part of something bigger. Full integration checklist: The release supports a larger PR or marketing objective Media and influencer outreach are pre-scheduled Social and community follow-ups are planned Tracking links (UTMs) are in place Content repurposing (blog, video, X thread) is mapped KPIs for reach, engagement, and conversions are defined If you can tick every box, you’re no longer distributing a story — you’re orchestrating a campaign. Conclusion Press releases are not dead; they’re just misunderstood. When integrated into a full-scale PR system, they become launch pads for attention, trust, and long-term brand authority. Modern crypto PR isn’t about one headline — it’s about the sequence that follows. A smart press release doesn’t end when published; it starts a narrative designed to grow stronger with every share, quote, and community echo.",More News,EN,0,0,SPONSORED|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Crypto Daily', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptodaily,2025-10-19 07:01:00

You Need to See This,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-to-xrp-holders-this-impacts-you-you-need-to-see-this/,"Crypto commentator Austin Hilton recently released a detailed update addressing Ripple’s newest billion-dollar initiative and its implications for XRP holders. In his latest video, Hilton discussed the company’s $1 billion acquisition of GTreasury, a U.S.-based treasury management software provider widely used by Fortune 500 corporations. He emphasized that this move marks a major advancement in Ripple’s efforts to strengthen its position in global finance and corporate liquidity management. Hilton began by acknowledging the current downturn in the crypto market, noting that XRP was trading at $2.29, down 15% on the seven-day chart and about 2% on the day. Despite the dip, he described the acquisition as a pivotal step in Ripple’s long-term strategy, explaining that the company continues to expand its infrastructure to integrate blockchain technology into the mainstream financial system.

XRP holders – this impacts you! pic.twitter.com/Uelj2DrLyg — Austin Hilton (@austinahilton) October 17, 2025 Building Enterprise-Grade Financial Infrastructure According to Hilton, Ripple’s purchase of GTreasury, which is still pending regulatory approval, would grant it access to a large network of enterprise clients. These include corporations managing substantial liquidity operations and foreign exchange flows. GTreasury’s platform is known for its cash, risk, and liquidity management tools—capabilities that Ripple intends to merge with its existing blockchain-based financial suite. Hilton reminded viewers that this acquisition follows two other major purchases earlier in the year: the stablecoin payment firm Rail and the prime brokerage firm Hidden Road . Together, these acquisitions form the foundation of Ripple’s plan to build what he described as a comprehensive “financial powerhouse services company” for the new era of digital finance. He noted that this approach connects Ripple directly to major treasury departments that still rely on traditional systems, presenting an opportunity to modernize operations through blockchain integration. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Positioning for the Next Phase of Global Finance Hilton underlined that Ripple’s move into the corporate treasury business goes beyond expanding its asset portfolio. It represents an effort to position the company as a central player in the evolving global financial landscape. By acquiring GTreasury, Ripple can embed its blockchain infrastructure into how enterprises manage liquidity and cross-border funds, effectively aligning XRP’s utility with institutional financial operations. He also addressed the lack of immediate price reaction, explaining that broader market conditions—including trade tensions with China, possible delays in ETF approvals, and uncertainty surrounding Federal Reserve decisions—are currently weighing on the crypto market as a whole. A Long-Term Perspective for XRP Holders Hilton concluded by urging XRP holders to maintain a broader perspective beyond short-term price fluctuations. He said the acquisition underscores Ripple’s vision to reshape financial services infrastructure and that holding XRP represents participation in that larger process. As he stated, the long-term value of XRP will be realized as Ripple’s ecosystem continues to expand and integrate within the institutional finance sector.

At the center of this shift are crypto asset-management companies — platforms and firms that help individuals and institutions invest, diversify, and manage crypto portfolios with professional discipline. For retail investors looking for a reliable all-in-one app and compliant exposure, the companies below represent the best examples of what crypto asset management looks like in 2025. What Is Crypto Portfolio Management? Crypto portfolio management refers to the process of buying, holding, and managing cryptocurrencies and tokenized assets in a structured way. Instead of self-trading or chasing hype cycles, investors use platforms or funds that organize assets into portfolios, track performance, and apply traditional risk-management methods. In short, it’s about treating digital assets like an investment class. Where early investors held coins on exchanges or cold wallets, today’s asset managers use regulated custodians, advanced analytics, and diversified portfolios to balance risk and return. These platforms often act as digital hubs combining wallets, analytics, and trading tools within one interface. How Crypto Asset Management Works The process varies depending on the platform’s structure, but generally follows three pillars: 1. Diversified Portfolio Construction Users (or fund managers) allocate capital across multiple crypto assets — Bitcoin, Ethereum, DeFi tokens, stablecoins, or even tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). The goal is to reduce volatility while keeping exposure to potential growth sectors. 2. Automated Rebalancing and Analytics Modern platforms use automation and AI-driven analysis to maintain target allocations and track profitability. Some apps, like Clapp , offer backtesting and rebalancing tools that help visualize how portfolio changes would have performed historically. 3. Secure Custody and Regulatory Oversight Assets are stored with regulated custodians or insured wallets, and trading happens on licensed exchanges. This combination of compliance and technology provides a safer framework for both retail and institutional users. Top Crypto Portfolio Management Companies in 2025 Below are the leading names in the field — from new all-in-one platforms to veteran investment firms — each offering a different take on how to manage digital wealth. 1. Clapp Finance — All-in-One Portfolio and Fiat Gateway Website: clapp.finance Clapp Finance is redefining what crypto asset management means for retail investors. Instead of fragmenting trading, storage, and tracking across multiple apps, Clapp unifies them under one interface that feels closer to a banking dashboard than an exchange. You can buy crypto with euros, convert back to fiat, swap tokens, and track portfolio performance — all within a single app. This integrated experience is powered by a smart liquidity aggregator that routes trades across both centralized and decentralized exchanges to secure the best possible execution price. For European users, Clapp’s SEPA integration simplifies fiat deposits and withdrawals, making the fiat-to-crypto bridge seamless. Importantly, Clapp doesn’t charge any deposit fees, whether in crypto or fiat — a notable differentiator in a market where such fees are common. Clapp is a regulated platform, operating under a VASP license in the Czech Republic, with additional approvals in progress across Europe and beyond. The upcoming Clapp Visa card will further close the loop, turning crypto portfolios into real-world spending power. Clapp’s strength lies in coherence — it combines portfolio management, exchange, and analytics into one system that helps users build, test, and manage diversified portfolios without switching apps or losing track of performance. 2. Bitwise Asset Management — Diversified Index Approach Website: bitwiseinvestments.com Bitwise, based in the US, focuses on crypto index funds and structured investment products. Its goal is to offer broad exposure to the digital-asset market through indices that track leading coins. This makes Bitwise ideal for investors who prefer a passive, diversified approach rather than individual token speculation. Bitwise’s products are also SEC-compliant, making them a preferred choice for financial advisors and institutions. 3. CoinShares International — Europe’s Veteran Digital-Asset Firm Website: coinshares.com CoinShares is one of the oldest names in European crypto asset management. Headquartered in Jersey, it offers ETPs and managed portfolios that give investors regulated access to digital assets. The firm has consistently worked within European frameworks, making it one of the more transparent and compliance-focused operators in the space. 4. Pantera Capital — Institutional Blockchain Investment Pantera Capital is among the first institutional investors in blockchain. Its funds span early-stage ventures, liquid tokens, and structured products aimed at long-term growth. While not retail-focused, Pantera remains a benchmark for professional crypto asset-management strategies. Website: panteracapital.com 5. Amber Group — Institutional-Grade Asset Management and Liquidity Amber Group, headquartered in Singapore, bridges trading, liquidity provision, and asset management. The firm works primarily with high-net-worth individuals and institutions, offering yield-enhanced strategies and global access to liquidity. Its approach merges professional portfolio construction with active risk management.

Functionality — does the platform offer just exposure, or active management tools? If you want a regulated, easy-to-use environment that merges portfolio management with fiat conversion, Clapp currently stands out as the most accessible all-in-one solution for EU-based investors. Final Thoughts Crypto asset management is maturing fast — shifting from unregulated experiments to structured, compliant systems.Whether you prefer a professional fund like Bitwise or Pantera, or an integrated app like Clapp, the key is the same: choose transparency, regulation, and usability over hype.

But as the industry matures, so do the strategies for managing digital wealth. Crypto portfolio management is the process of strategically building, tracking, and adjusting a collection of crypto assets to match an investor’s goals and risk tolerance. Whether you’re a hands-on trader or a passive holder, understanding how portfolio management works can make the difference between chasing pumps and building long-term value. Key Elements of Crypto Portfolio Management Asset Allocation and Investment Selection At the core of any portfolio is asset allocation: deciding how much capital to dedicate to each crypto asset. For example, you might weigh your portfolio toward Bitcoin and Ethereum for stability, while reserving a smaller portion for higher-risk altcoins or newer sectors like AI tokens or RWAs. Effective portfolio construction also considers sector exposure (e.g., Layer 1s vs. DeFi vs. exchanges), project fundamentals, and market cycles. Trade Execution Once you’ve chosen your allocation, execution becomes key. The challenge is to access multiple assets without overpaying on fees or splitting liquidity across different exchanges. Some platforms aggregate liquidity from multiple sources to improve execution prices and reduce slippage. Monitoring and Performance Tracking Your portfolio is only as good as your ability to monitor it. Real-time tracking tools show you profit/loss, price movements, and exposure in an organized dashboard. This becomes especially important as your portfolio grows more complex — and manual tracking becomes unrealistic. Rebalancing and Diversification Markets shift, and so should portfolios. Rebalancing means adjusting the allocation to stay aligned with your original risk profile. For instance, if a particular altcoin doubles in value and overtakes your target allocation, rebalancing trims it back and redistributes the gains. Platforms that support automatic rebalancing can save time and reduce emotional decision-making. Diversification in crypto means spreading your investment across various asset types — not just coins, but also sectors, protocols, and blockchain ecosystems. A portfolio that includes BTC, ETH, L2 tokens, and stablecoin strategies is less exposed to single-asset volatility. Clapp Portfolio Management: Structured Crypto Investing for Maximum Efficiency While most crypto platforms stop at simple swaps or basic price charts, Clapp.finance is built entirely around structured portfolio management — offering a rare combination of automation, insight, and flexibility within one app. Real-Time Tracking and Actionable Insights Every portfolio on Clapp comes with real-time profitability stats. You can instantly see how your investments are performing — no spreadsheets, no API exports, no third-party dashboards. You’re not flying blind. You know what’s working and what isn’t, every time you open the app. Backtesting with Time Machine Clapp’s “Time Machine” feature takes things further with two kinds of backtesting: General Backtesting: Simulate how a combination of assets would have performed over time — giving you visibility into potential returns and volatility before committing capital. Rebalancing-Based Backtesting: Explore how scheduled rebalancing would’ve impacted results, helping you fine-tune strategy with data. These aren’t common features in crypto portfolio apps — and they make Clapp feel closer to a professional investing tool. Smart Rebalancing Once your portfolio is set, Clapp handles the heavy lifting. As prices move, Clapp automatically adjusts your allocations to maintain the structure you’ve defined. It’s crypto investing without micromanagement — and without forgetting your plan in the heat of the market. Key Highlights of Clapp Portfolio Management Crypto portfolio management isn’t just about watching charts anymore. It's about: Planning ahead Managing risk Acting based on data, not emotion Tracking performance in real time Making smart, automated adjustments Clapp represents the kind of tool that makes this possible. It doesn’t just hold your assets — it helps you understand and improve your strategy every step of the way. Structure, automation, and insight — manage your crypto portfolios at clapp.finance Final Thoughts Crypto portfolio management has grown beyond simple HODLing. In today’s volatile market, having a structured approach that includes real-time tracking, data-backed decisions, and smart automation can be quite helpful. Whether you’re new to digital investing or building a more advanced strategy, managing your crypto like a portfolio can make a meaningful difference. The right tools won’t guarantee gains, but they can improve consistency, reduce guesswork, and put you in control. As platforms like Clapp evolve, crypto investing is becoming more strategic, more secure, and more accessible. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) What is a crypto portfolio? A crypto portfolio is a collection of digital assets — such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, stablecoins, and other tokens — held by an individual or institution. Like a traditional investment portfolio, it reflects your asset allocation and investment strategy, balancing risk and potential return. Why is portfolio management important in crypto? Because crypto markets are highly volatile, portfolio management helps investors reduce risk, preserve gains, and follow a structured plan. It enables better decision-making through diversification, real-time performance tracking, and strategy-driven rebalancing — rather than emotional or impulsive trading. What tools can I use to manage my crypto portfolio? There are several crypto portfolio management platforms and apps. Some offer basic tracking, while others include smart rebalancing, backtesting, and integrated trading features. Clapp is a standout example — combining real-time tracking, automation, and smart tools like “Time Machine” for testing strategies before investing. What is rebalancing in crypto investing? Rebalancing is the process of adjusting your crypto portfolio to maintain your target allocation. For example, if one token surges in value and skews your balance, rebalancing trims it back and redistributes gains — helping manage risk and stay aligned with your long-term goals. How does Clapp help with crypto portfolio management? Clapp offers a comprehensive platform for crypto investors. It includes: Real-time performance tracking Smart rebalancing to maintain structure Historical backtesting tools (Time Machine) Fiat on/off ramp integrations An intuitive dashboard that unifies investing, tracking, and conversion It’s built to feel more like a modern investing tool than a trading app. Is crypto portfolio management only for advanced investors? Not at all. Many platforms — like Clapp — are designed for users of all levels. With automation, curated portfolios, and clear visualizations, even beginners can start managing their assets more strategically without needing deep technical or market knowledge.

World Liberty Financial price prediction for 2025 expects the price of WLFI to surge toward $0.41. By 2031, we expect the World Liberty Financial price to record a maximum price of $1.4. Donald Trump has embraced the title of the “crypto president”, a label that has fueled massive speculation across the crypto industry. After Trump’s 2024 election victory, the price of Bitcoin surged, a move many analysts and traders called a bullish signal for the broader cryptocurrency market. Building on this momentum, Trump introduced his own branded tokens—most notably the $TRUMP token and $MELANIA memecoin—cementing his direct involvement in the world of digital assets. Whether Trump’s push into crypto is driven by policy goals or personal profit, one message is clear: he intends to make cryptocurrency part of both his political strategy and financial portfolio. However, Trump’s personal involvement in crypto tokens raises critical ethical questions. If a sitting or future U.S. president profits directly from token sales, DeFi projects, or blockchain ventures, it risks blurring the line between public duty and private gain. One project drawing major attention is World Liberty Financial after major listings, a Trump-backed decentralized finance (DeFi) platform. This article explores what World Liberty Financial is, and what Trump’s embrace of crypto could mean for the future of Bitcoin, memecoins, and U.S. crypto policy. Consequently, numerous analysts eagerly anticipate the future valuation of its native cryptocurrency, WLFI. This raises the question: Can WLFI price reach $1? This forecast for World Liberty Financial’s price examines factors such as ecosystem trends, adoption rates, underlying technology, and technical analysis to project the WLFI price prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency World Liberty Financial Ticker Symbol WLFI Rank 27 Current Price $0.129 Price change 24H -1.3% Market cap $5.26 Billion Circulating supply 24.66 Billion WLFI Trading volume 24h $1.21B (+2.1%) All-time high $0.46, September 1, 2025 All-time low $0.1632, September 4, 2025 WLFI price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.129 Price Prediction $0.1 (-24.95%) Fear & Greed Index 71 (Greed) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 4.95% Green Days 13/30 (43%) 50-Day SMA NO DATA 200-Day SMA NO DATA 14-Day RSI 44.92 World Liberty Financial technical analysis: WLFI price faces bearish pressure toward $0.129 WLFI price analysis shows a bearish pattern toward $0.129 Resistance for WLFI is present at $0.1489 Support for WLFI/USD is present at $0.1157 The WLFI price analysis for 19 October confirms that WLFI faces increasing volatility as it declines toward $0.129. Currently, the bulls are aiming for a recovery. WLFI price chart prediction: World Liberty Financial faces selling pressure toward $0.129 WLFI price is facing a decline as sellers push the price toward $0.129. WLFI price is aiming for a hold around the immediate Fib channels. The 24-hour volume dropped toward $8.6 million, showing decreased interest in trading activity. The price is trading at $0.129, declining over 1.3% in the last 24 hours. WLFIUSDT chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has dropped from its previous level and trades below the midline at level 32.5, suggesting selling pressure. WLFI/USD 4-hour price chart: Bears aim for a hold below EMA trend lines The 4-hour WLFI price chart suggests WLFI continues to experience bearish activity around EMA lines, creating a negative sentiment on the price chart. As the price continues to face resistance near the Fib level, bears prepare for a domination by holding the price below the EMA20 trend line. WLFIUSDT chart by TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a negative region at 0.75, hinting that sellers are trying to build pressure near resistance levels and boost a downward correction. However, the MACD trend line has formed green candles above the signal line, hinting at a buying pressure.

The hourly price chart confirms that bears are making efforts to prevent the WLFI price from an immediate surge. However, if WLFI’s price successfully breaks above $0.1489, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $0.1892. WLFIUSDT chart by TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, WLFI’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.1157, resulting in a correction to $0.0787. WLFI crypto news World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a crypto venture linked to the Trump family, sold part of its locked token holdings to Bitcoin mining firm Hut 8 for inclusion in the latter’s long-term crypto reserve. Though WLFI didn’t specify the amount, on-chain data suggests about 100 million tokens were sold at $0.25 each, totaling roughly $25 million. WLFI recently sold tokens at $0.25 to Hut8 for their treasury. The locked tokens sent from the WLFI treasury were simply to satisfy that sale — not new issuance, not dilution. We appreciate Hut8’s support as a long-term partner. 🦅 — WLFI (@worldlibertyfi) October 3, 2025 Is WLFI a good investment? Trading $WLFI will be very risky. Since it’s a new and highly hyped token with only a small amount available at launch, the price could change quickly and unpredictably. Liquidity will be thin, so even one big trade might move the market. It’s normal for tokens like this to surge at launch and then drop as early buyers cash out. However, considering its background and ongoing trading volume, WLFI can turn out to be a good investment option in the long-term. Why is the WLFI price down today? Buyers failed to maintain demand around $0.15 level, resulting in a downward correction. What is the WLFI price prediction for 2025? By 2025, analysts predict that World Liberty Financial (WLFI) will start the year at $0.15, with an average trading price of $0.37, and could climb as high as $0.41. Will WLFI price touch $1? Yes, WLFI price might touch the $1 milestone by the end of 2030. However, the token might attain this level much earlier, depending on the future market sentiment and buying demand. Will WLFI Price Reach $10? If everything remains good and WLFI gains recognition, its price might surpass $10 by 2040. Is WLFI a good long-term investment? As World Liberty Financial aims to expand its offerings, it might gain a significant position in the altcoin market. Hence, WLFI can be a good long-term investment option. The WLFI long term price outlook is looking strong due to its strong political support. WLFI price prediction October 2025 Analysts expect a steady surge in crypto market prices in October month. We expect WLFI to record a minimum price of $0.15 and a maximum price of $0.3, with an average of $0.2 in October.

According to their predictions, this would be significantly higher than the previous year, marking a strong and acceptable jump for World Liberty Financial. WLFI Prediction for 2028 By 2028, forecasts suggest WLFI will open at $0.7, trade at an average of $0.8, and could move up to $0.81. This consistent upward trend shows that the token could be strengthening its position in the market. World Liberty Financial Price Prediction 2029 By 2029, analysts expect WLFI to begin at $0.72, maintain an average price of $0.83, and rise toward $0.86. Even though the forecast mirrors the previous year’s outlook, price stability could signal resilience in an often volatile crypto market. WLFI Crypto Price Forecast for 2030 By 2030, experts predict WLFI will start at $0.89, trade at an average of $0.96, and potentially reach $1.02. Crossing the one-dollar mark would be a significant psychological milestone for investors and a strong indicator of growth.

This represents a healthy climb from 2025, showing that WLFI is gaining traction in the crypto space. WLFI historic price sentiment WLFI Price History The $WLFI governance token for World Liberty Financial, the Trump family–backed DeFi platform, launched for public trading and token claims on September 1, 2025, at 12:00 UTC. This token generation event (TGE) kicked off spot trading on Ethereum’s mainnet, following a presale that raised over $550 million from 85,000+ investors since October 2024. The WLFI token price initially surged toward $0.478 but it later declined toward $0.1611. On 6 September, the WLFI price again attempted a surge toward $0.2.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView indicated subdued volatility heading into the weekend, providing a short break after a turbulent week that saw BTC drop roughly 7%. At its lowest levels in months, the cryptocurrency remains under pressure due to weak buyer demand and shifting macroeconomic conditions. “It all lines up nicely across the board for another wave down,” trader Crypto Tony said in an X post. “Bitcoin I see us dropping to $95,000, possibly testing the $91,000 region before we find a bottom.” Short-Term Sentiment Divided While some traders anticipate further declines, others expect price stability over the weekend. “BTC did a good job recovering some ground on Friday before the CME close,” said trader Daan Crypto Trades. “This makes it so we’re likely to stick around this ~$107K level during the weekend.” He identified $105,000 as a crucial support level, suggesting a potential rebound if global stock markets continue to strengthen. Equities ended the week on a more optimistic note, with the S&P 500 closing at 6,664 — recovering roughly half of its previous losses. Analysts attributed the rebound partly to U.S. President Donald Trump’s comments that recent tariff increases on China may not last, easing investor concerns. Gold prices, which recently reached record highs, also moderated slightly. RSI Suggests a Potential Reversal Some technical indicators point to possible relief for Bitcoin bulls. Analysts have noted that Bitcoin’s relative strength index (RSI) is at its lowest level since April, when BTC briefly fell to $75,000 before rebounding. On the four-hour chart, RSI is forming a bullish divergence — with price reaching lower lows while RSI moves higher, suggesting selling pressure is beginning to ease below $110,000. However, market sentiment remains cautious. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index fell to 22 out of 100 on Friday, its first time entering “extreme fear” territory since April, indicating heightened bearishness across the market.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-10-19 07:52:41

Institutional capital, long seen as the tide that lifts all ships, is quietly flowing back into Bitcoin and large cap altcoins, sparking hopes of a fresh Q4 rally. Analysts suggest that the current correction phase has likely bottomed out, with on-chain indicators flashing oversold conditions across several top assets. Among them, Cardano (ADA), MAGACOIN FINANCE and Ripple (XRP) stand out as prime examples of undervalued tokens poised for major breakout with strong fundamentals and ecosystem utility, thus setting the pace as the best cryptos to buy for a 25x return over the next market cycle. Cardano: RSI Confirms Oversold Zone The 10th-largest cryptocurrency, Cardano (ADA), recently fell 9% in 24 hours to $0.60 before rebounding slightly. On-chain data shows around 350 million ADA were offloaded by whales, pushing the Relative Strength Index (RSI) down to 30.79 , a historically oversold level. Cardano Price Chart | Source: TradingView Analyst Ali Martinez noted that whale holdings now make up just 10% of supply, signaling potential accumulation. At $0.6196 , ADA’s trading volume jumped 61% to $1.87 billion , indicating renewed demand. Founder Charles Hoskinson remains upbeat, highlighting upgrades like Ouroboros Leios and the Google Cloud partnership as long-term catalysts positioning Cardano as the best crypto to buy in 2025. Ripple (XRP): Wave 5 Setup Before Major Breakout Ripple’s XRP continues to consolidate near Wave 4 resistance after a 6% drop. Analyst CasiTrades said this pause aligns with Elliott Wave Theory , hinting at a final Wave 5 leg before a strong reversal. The .618 Fibonacci retracement near $1.46 acts as key support, while Ali Martinez cites $2.10 as the next critical level. Holding above these zones could trigger a reversal toward $6.50–$10.00 , completing XRP’s macro structure. Analysts note that institutional traders are quietly reaccumulating at lower levels, a setup that historically precedes large upside moves. If XRP can sustain momentum above $2.80, it may confirm a new long-term uptrend, cementing its status as one of the best cryptos to buy among legacy altcoins. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Early-Stage Winner Poised for Institutional Adoption While ADA and XRP consolidate near technical bottoms, a growing number of analysts are eyeing MAGACOIN FINANCE as the next-generation altcoin that combines early-stage accessibility with a tokenomics model built for long-term value capture capable of delivering asymmetric returns in 2025. Industry analysts describe MAGACOIN FINANCE as a “micro-cap with macro potential,” drawing parallels to Ethereum’s early 2017 phase. With exchange listings on the horizon and a rapidly expanding ecosystem, it’s being positioned as one of the best cryptos to buy in Q4, 2025. As Cardano and XRP regain momentum and institutional liquidity flows back into the market, investors are increasingly turning to early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE , fueling strong growth and rising on-chain activity, potentially exceeding 25x gains. Outlook: From Capitulation to Opportunity The broader market appears to be shifting from capitulation to accumulation. With Cardano and XRP signaling deep value zones, and MAGACOIN FINANCE offering a ground-floor opportunity, traders and institutions alike are reloading for what could become crypto’s most profitable year since 2021. If current on-chain and macro indicators hold, the stage is set for a coordinated altcoin recovery — one where early investors in fundamentally sound projects could reap outsized returns as liquidity floods back into the ecosystem.

Although the company has not officially confirmed the plan, Bloomberg’s report on the initiative has already drawn speculation about Ripple’s strategy and how it could affect perceptions of its long-term approach to XRP management. Community commentator Nietzbux (@nietzbux) explained Ripple’s approach, suggesting that several structural and strategic factors might be behind the decision to raise capital instead of drawing directly from its escrow holdings. There are several reasons Ripple would buy new XRP with new capital for a treasury, yet many ask, why not just move all from the escrow? A purely speculative factor: maybe the pre-allocation theory is correct and Ripple has less XRP in the escrow than the public thinks. — nietzbux (@nietzbux) October 17, 2025 Ripple and the Growing Interest in XRP Treasuries Recent months have seen several companies announce or develop XRP treasury programs, indicating growing institutional interest in holding XRP as a strategic asset. VivoPower, for instance, secured $19 million earlier this month to expand its XRP treasury . Similarly, Everything Blockchain and Trident Digital have each revealed plans to build their own holdings. In this context, the possibility of Ripple joining the trend has attracted considerable attention. Establishing a formal XRP treasury could enhance market confidence, signaling that the company remains committed to the asset’s role in liquidity and payments infrastructure. However, this raises a central question among community observers. If Ripple already controls a large escrow account containing roughly 35 billion XRP , why not use a portion of those tokens instead of raising fresh funds? Why Is Ripple Not Using Escrowed Tokens This question has prompted various interpretations within the XRP community. According to Nietzbux, the decision could relate to how Ripple’s escrowed XRP is structured and potentially committed. While emphasizing that his view is speculative, he referenced a long-discussed theory suggesting Ripple may have previously entered into institutional agreements that pre-allocated portions of its escrow holdings. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 If Ripple’s escrowed XRP is partially reserved or already sold to institutions, the company may have limited access to those tokens. This could explain its plan to raise funds for new XRP purchases, though Bloomberg noted some escrowed tokens might still be used, leaving questions about Ripple’s actual control. A Step Toward a Formal Treasury Strategy Nietzbux noted that interest in a Ripple-backed XRP treasury has grown for months. Last year, he asked when the company would begin acquiring XRP for that purpose. In July, Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley suggested Ripple could become an XRP treasury firm within a year. While the reports remain unconfirmed, enthusiasm within the community is clear. If Ripple proceeds with the plan, it could signal a move toward institutional XRP management and stronger integration within payment and liquidity systems, showing Ripple’s confidence in the asset’s future.

From meme coins with loyal communities to presales promising exponential returns, savvy investors and blockchain enthusiasts have their eyes on the most promising projects. Among these, BullZilla shines brightest as the 100x best meme coin to buy now, offering staggering return-on-investment potential that could redefine what investors expect from meme tokens. 1. BullZilla: The 100x Best Meme Coin to Buy Now That’s Redefining ROI Potential BullZilla’s meteoric rise places it firmly among the most promising tokens in 2025. Currently in Stage 7, Phase 1 of its presale, BullZilla’s price sits at $0.00016573, a fraction of its expected listing price of $0.00527. The project has already raised over $920,000, boasts more than 3,000 token holders, and has sold over 31 billion tokens. Early investors are seeing jaw-dropping returns, with a ROI of 3080.72% from Stage 7A to the projected listing price, while the ROI for the earliest joiners until Stage 7A stands at 2782.26%. A $1,000 investment today would secure approximately 6.033 million $BZIL tokens, and the upcoming Stage 7B is projected to bring a 4.02% price increase from $0.00016573 to $0.0001724. Financial analysts highlight BullZilla’s approach to scarcity and token distribution as a cornerstone of its potential. The presale phases gradually reduce token availability, increasing demand organically. This method contrasts with many meme coins that flood the market, diluting value. According to data from CoinGecko, projects with controlled tokenomics outperform those with unregulated supplies by over 40% in the first six months post-launch. BullZilla’s presale also incorporates a unique community-driven marketing engine.In short, BullZilla represents the 100x best meme coin to buy now for those aiming to maximize ROI while participating in an evolving meme coin landscape. 2. Pepe: The Timeless Meme Coin Still Holding Strong Pepe remains one of the most recognizable 100x best meme coins to buy now, drawing from its internet culture roots. It’s more than just a token; it is a cultural phenomenon that continues to attract new investors through its vibrant community and regular project updates. Recent data shows Pepe maintaining steady liquidity and a growing number of token holders. Its broad adoption on decentralized exchanges speaks to its lasting appeal despite market fluctuations. Pepe’s development team consistently releases features enhancing usability and integrating DeFi mechanics, a smart move for sustainability. 3. MoonBull: The Staking Revolution That Rewards Conviction MoonBull (MOBU) is making waves by fusing meme culture with robust decentralized finance protocols. Currently in presale, MoonBull’s appeal lies in its high-functioning staking features and scarcity mechanisms. The project operates on Ethereum and offers a 95% APY staking return through its innovative rewards system. Its 23-stage scarcity model encourages long-term holding, with every transaction contributing to liquidity and token burns. This dynamic approach enhances price stability while rewarding commitment. The platform’s verified smart contracts and fully locked liquidity reassure investors of its security. 4. La Culex: A Presale Project Built for Safety and Growth La Culex is emerging as a promising crypto presale, combining meme coin allure with sustainable tokenomics. The total supply is 200 billion tokens, distributed with 45% dedicated to presale, 15% for staking rewards, 20% locked liquidity for 18 months, and 2 billion tokens earmarked for burns. The presale is divided into 32 stages, each making the token scarcer, thereby increasing its anticipated listing price of $0.007. This phased scarcity aligns with principles of supply control crucial for price appreciation. La Culex offers community incentives such as an 80% APY staking through its Hive Vault and a 12% referral reward system via the Bite Chain. 5. Pudgy Penguins: From NFT Stardom to Meme Coin Momentum Pudgy Penguins started as one of the most beloved NFT collections and is now making waves as a meme coin with serious potential.

The project has evolved beyond NFTs, incorporating DeFi features like staking and token rewards that incentivize holders to stay engaged. These additions enhance its utility and support long-term growth. 6.

Known for its vibrant and loyal following, Bonk combines playful branding with serious tokenomics designed to reward holders over time. With a limited supply and ongoing burn events, the project steadily reduces circulating tokens, creating natural scarcity that often fuels price appreciation. As more investors seek the 100x best meme coin to buy now, Bonk stands out for its consistent growth and active ecosystem. Its transparent development team frequently engages with the community, launching partnerships and marketing campaigns that increase visibility. Unlike some fleeting meme coins, Bonk emphasizes sustainable expansion through staking rewards and liquidity locking. 7. SPX6900: The Rising Meme Coin with Massive Growth Potential SPX6900 is rapidly gaining traction as one of the most promising meme coins on the horizon. With its innovative approach to scarcity and a committed community, SPX6900 is shaping up to be a serious contender in the race for the 100x best meme coin to buy now. The token features a carefully designed supply cap and strategic token burns that steadily reduce availability, creating upward price pressure. 8. FLOKI: The Meme Coin with a Loyal Following and Growth Momentum FLOKI has established itself as a powerhouse in the meme coin universe, backed by one of the most passionate communities in crypto. Known for its strong brand identity and ongoing development efforts, FLOKI continues to attract new investors eager to capitalize on its growth potential.

The campaign, backed by a $400,000 prize pool, is aimed at reinforcing Arbitrum’s role as gTrade’s primary ecosystem for deep liquidity and trading activity. While gTrade maintains a multi-chain presence, this initiative underscores its commitment to concentrating liquidity around Arbitrum, where it continues to see the highest volume and user engagement. The contest is funded directly from gTrade’s protocol treasury, following the receipt of 4.5 million ARB from Arbitrum’s STIP incentives and an additional 2.25 million ARB through STIP.B in 2024. All trades for the contest must be executed on Arbitrum using USDC as collateral. The competition will feature two distinct tracks: P&L Leaderboard – $200,000 in PrizesTraders will be ranked by realized or withdrawn profit and loss (P&L) across all trading pairs, including Real-World Asset (RWA) and DEGEN markets. Eligible trades must be both opened and closed on Arbitrum using USDC. Volume Leaderboard – $200,000 in PrizesParticipants will compete based on cumulative trading volume. A time-weighted multiplier will be applied to reward longer-held positions, encouraging strategic trading behavior. “We designed this competition to celebrate our Arbitrum traders and continue building on the network where our liquidity is strongest,” said Nathan, Project Lead at Gains Network. “By focusing our efforts on Arbitrum, we’re creating a more efficient environment for traders and rewarding the community that has supported our growth.” The “Trick or Trade” contest reflects gTrade’s broader roadmap to consolidate activity on Arbitrum while maintaining multi-chain accessibility for users.

In his post on the X platform, Alderoty stated that recent news in traditional media has ignored the transparent blockchain and its large user base. “These words are useful, but lazy and wrong,” Alderoty said, arguing that the primary focus should be on who uses crypto and for what purposes. He noted that digital assets are used by tens of millions of Americans in practical applications like lending, proof of ownership, and establishing new trading models. “Crime does not thrive in a system that operates openly,” Alderoty said, arguing that public blockchains make transactions more traceable, thus providing transparency and an advantage in terms of detecting criminal activity. Related News: Wash Trading Suspicion for a Whale on Binance: They Are Targeting One Altcoin in Particular The overarching theme of Alderoty's message was that crypto isn't a “speculation space,” but rather a toolkit that shortens transaction times, reduces middlemen, and creates auditable records. He pointed out that the real story lies in crypto's everyday benefits. Alderoty also stated that the National Cryptocurrency Association, which Ripple supported with a $50 million grant on March 5, has undertaken the mission of telling these user stories and providing accurate information. While cryptocurrency can be used in criminal activities, generalizing it is a huge mistake, according to Alderoty. “The reality is that open systems allow for persistent and continuous control,” he said. “The narrative needs to catch up with reality.” *This is not investment advice.

In an announcement this week, the Wikipedia Foundation claimed that human traffic to Wikipedia dropped by 8% between May and August compared to the same period last year. The drop became glaring after the platform discovered that sophisticated bots, primarily based in Brazil, had been disguising themselves as human visitors. After an update to its detection systems in May, the foundation reclassified traffic data and discovered that much of the unusually high traffic came from bots developed to evade detection. The revised number revealed that fewer people now visit Wikipedia because search engines now provide users with summaries. Wikipedia complains about lost traffic to AI summaries According to Marshall Miller, after the revisions were made, the foundation discovered a drastic decline in human page views on Wikipedia over the past few months, which has amounted to an 8% decrease compared to the same month in 2024. “We believe that these declines reflect the impact of generative AI and social media on how people seek information, especially with search engines providing answers directly to searchers, often based on Wikipedia content,” he said. Wikipedia is not the only publishing outfit suffering from this AI-related issue. Data from Pew Research showed that median year-over-year referral traffic from Google Search to premium publishers reduced drastically every week during May and June, with losses outpacing gains two-to-one. According to the report, more than 60% of all Google searches end up in an AI summary instead of promoting the actual source of the information and pointing users towards it. Publishers across industries have sounded alarms, with some resorting to lawsuits to get some sort of protection. Danielle Coffey, who is in charge of News/Media Alliance representing more than 2,000 outlets, mentioned that Google is using publisher content without any form of compensation. She also noted that the platform has offered no meaningful way to opt out without disappearing from searches entirely. “It’s parasitic, it’s unsustainable, and it poses a real existential threat to many in our industry,” she said. AI-generated content predicted to rise by 2026 The same sentiment was echoed by Neil Vogel, CEO of People, after he accused Google of being a bad actor. Vogel stated that Google is not playing fair because it uses the same bot to crawl websites to index them for its search engine and support its AI features. “Google has one crawler, which means they use the same crawler for their search, where they still send us traffic, as they do for their AI products, where they steal our content,” said Vogel. Meanwhile, the volume of AI content online is now on the rise. A research report from SEO firm Graphite discovered that as of November 2024, almost half of new web articles were generated using artificial intelligence in some form. The figure was up by 5% before ChatGPT was introduced. A post by Perplexity on X noted that AI content went from about 5% in 2020 to 48% by May 2025, with projections highlighting that the number could go as high as 90% by next year. The Wikimedia Foundation claimed that fewer visits to Wikipedia could mean that fewer volunteers grow and enrich the content, and fewer individual donors support their work. The foundation mentioned that it is responding by enforcing policies for third-party access, developing a framework for attribution, and looking for ways to bring free knowledge to the younger generation on platforms like YouTube and TikTok. The foundation noted that Wikipedia’s human knowledge remains valuable to the world.

The company argues that regulators and investors cannot fully evaluate the plan without public details on how the Depository Trust Company (DTC) — the primary depository for U.S. securities will manage blockchain settlement. Ondo supports Nasdaq’s efforts to modernize markets, but says the process must be transparent and inclusive. “Nasdaq’s reliance on non-public information implies differential access that deprives other firms of a fair opportunity to express their views,” the company warned in a letter to the SEC. The firm also noted that Nasdaq’s rule cannot take effect until DTC finishes developing its new settlement system, adding that there is no risk in delaying approval until more details are disclosed. Ondo urged the SEC to prioritize open standards that give all market participants equal footing. Nasdaq’s Proposal and Growing Competition in Tokenized Markets On September 8, Nasdaq filed its application to allow tokenized securities to trade alongside traditional stocks, with settlement handled through DTC’s upcoming blockchain-based infrastructure. The proposal entered a 45-day SEC review window on September 22, which could be extended into December. Meanwhile, competition around tokenized securities is accelerating: On June 30, Robinhood launched a Layer-2 blockchain to support trading of tokenized U.S. stocks and ETFs for European users. The platform announced that it will offer more than 200 U.S. securities as on-chain tokens. Trading platform eToro also revealed plans to launch tokenized stocks as ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum. The company stated that the rollout will include 100 popular U.S.-listed stocks and ETFs, available for trading 24/5. Kraken is following the same trend. The crypto exchange launched its tokenized securities platform in September, making tokenized shares available to its clients in Europe. A Turning Point for Wall Street? Galaxy Digital recently warned that tokenization could eventually threaten the dominance of legacy exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange by shifting liquidity to blockchain-based platforms.

Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. (SMBC), and Mizuho Bank will issue the stablecoin on MUFG’s Progmat platform, setting a foundation for seamless and interoperable digital payments across Japan’s corporate ecosystem. Together, the three institutions serve more than 300,000 corporate clients. By using a shared blockchain-based system, the banks hope to simplify settlements, eliminate delays, and enable faster, lower-cost transactions between companies. Mitsubishi Corp. Takes the Lead as First User Mitsubishi Corp. will be the first to adopt the stablecoin for internal financial flows. With over 240 subsidiaries worldwide, the company plans to streamline dividend payments, asset purchases, and cross-border transfers, reducing administrative burdens that currently slow corporate finance. If successful, this could become Japan’s first unified bank-issued stablecoin network, operating across multiple public blockchains including Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, and Cosmos. MUFG has also signaled plans to expand to more networks. Growing Momentum and Rising Competition The initiative has already sparked wider interest. Binance Japan recently partnered with Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking Corp. to explore stablecoin issuance on Progmat, while regulators at Japan’s Financial Services Agency are preparing to approve yen-based stablecoins. Fintech firms like JPYC and financial groups such as Monex are also pursuing yen-pegged digital assets, signaling that the race has begun.

By 2028, AAVE could reach a maximum price of $776.48. In 2031, AAVE will range between $1,164.73 to $1,261.79. Aave is a decentralized lending protocol on the Ethereum blockchain . It is known for its innovative financial solutions, such as flash loans, which allow users to borrow instantly without collateral, and dynamic interest rates that adapt to market conditions. Participants in the Aave ecosystem can deposit their digital crypto assets back into liquidity pools to earn interest payments or obtain loans by borrowing funds without providing collateral. Aave’s governance and fee distribution are significantly driven by its native token, AAVE, enhancing its utility and value within the platform. Having touched its ATH at $666.86 in May 2021, how much will AAVE be worth in 2025? Is AAVE worth holding? Let’s get into the Aave technical analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Aave Ticker AAVE Current price $214.88 Market cap $3.28B Trading volume (24-h) $226.42M Circulating supply 15.25M AAVE All-time high $666.86 on May 19, 2021 All-time low $26.02 on Nov 5, 2020 24-hour low $217.54 24-hour high $207.72 Aave price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 8.72% 50-day SMA $284.72 14-Day RSI 34.22 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 29 (Fear) Green days 15/30 (50%) 200-Day SMA $259.43 Aave 1-day price analysis Key takeaways AAVE is consolidating near $215 after extended losses, with the $210–$212 region acting as short-term support. Momentum remains bearish but is showing early signs of stabilization. Key resistance lies between $222 and $258. Aave 1-day price chart On the daily timeframe for October 19, AAVE is trading around $215.32, marking a modest 0.21% uptick as it consolidates after several days of decline. The price is hovering near the lower Bollinger Band ($200.37), indicating that the market may be approaching a short-term oversold condition. The upper and middle bands at $316.67 and $258.52, respectively, remain distant, underlining the depth of recent losses. AAVEUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD remains in negative territory, with widening histogram bars below zero, suggesting bearish momentum still dominates. However, the flattening of the bars hints at possible slowing in selling pressure. Volume has declined notably to 16.1M, which aligns with consolidation behavior rather than continuation of sharp declines. If AAVE holds above $210–$212, buyers may find an early accumulation zone, with the next potential bullish push toward $230–$240, followed by $258 as the first strong resistance. A breakdown below $200 would invalidate this recovery attempt and open a path toward $180 support. Aave 4-hour price chart On the 4-hour chart, AAVE trades at $214.56, showing mild intraday weakness after a brief recovery. The Alligator indicator lines are tightly intertwined, signaling a phase of low volatility and indecision. The red (lips) and green (teeth) lines hover around $216.55–$213.73, confirming that price is trying to stabilize but remains under pressure from the blue jaw line ($222.48), the key short-term resistance. AAVEUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The RSI at 40.37 is recovering from a near-oversold 33.03, reflecting a modest uptick in buying interest but still within a bearish-to-neutral zone. The PVT (Price Volume Trend) remains flat, implying that volume isn’t strongly supporting bullish momentum yet. If bulls manage to push above $222, momentum could target $230–$235, but rejection at this level could send the price back to $210 or even $205. Consolidation between $210–$222 is likely before any decisive breakout.

A confirmed breakout above $222 could trigger a short rally toward $240–$250, but failure to hold above $210 risks another downward leg. Is AAVE a good investment?

Alibaba-backed Ant Group and e-commerce giant JD.com were among the firms that had expressed interest earlier this year in joining Hong Kong’s pilot stablecoin program or issuing virtual asset-backed products such as tokenized bonds. However, those plans have now been put on hold following guidance from regulators, including the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) and the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), according to sources familiar with the matter. Beijing steps in as PBoC warns against private stablecoin issuance The PBoC is said to have discouraged firms from participating in early trials, with concerns surrounding the potential impact of allowing private parties to issue any kind of currency. Private stablecoins were seen as a potential threat to the central bank’s own digital yuan project (e-CNY), according to one source. “The real regulatory concern is, who has the ultimate right of coinage — the central bank or any private companies on the market?” said a different person. Stablecoins, which are digital assets pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar, form a critical part of the global cryptocurrency ecosystem. Unlike BTC and other digital assets that fluctuate widely, stablecoins are designed to track the value one-for-one of traditional currencies, primarily the US dollar. The pushback from Beijing reflects a broader global trend, as regulators worldwide weigh the implications of stablecoins on monetary sovereignty and financial stability. Still, JPMorgan Chase & Co. recently said the worldwide acceptance of stablecoins could flood trillions of dollars into the US dollar over time, with future estimates for demand of the digital asset varying widely. “Rather than accelerating de-dollarization, growth in stablecoin adoption has the potential to reinforce the dollar’s role in global finance,” a JPMorgan team including Kunj Padh, Meera Chandan, and Octavia Popescu said in a Tuesday note. Bank strategists have various projections for the eventual scale of the stablecoin market, even within JPMorgan itself. A team of strategists covering emerging market equities thinks that the market will ultimately become as large as $2 trillion. The bank’s US rates strategists are more cautious and have a forecast for ultimate uptake of about $500 billion. JPMorgan strategists estimate that roughly 99% of all stablecoins are backed one-to-one by the US dollar or dollar-denominated assets. Ant Group and JD.com retreat from Hong Kong’s digital currency pilot The European Central Bank (ECB) has previously warned that the widespread use of dollar-based stablecoins could erode its monetary policy powers. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), for its part, in August started accepting applications from stablecoin issuers, positioning the city as a testing ground for mainland China’s digital finance aspirations. Interest from Chinese companies in the Hong Kong project surged over the summer, with some viewing renminbi-backed stablecoins as a potential means to expand the international use of the yuan. As early as June, former Vice Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao declared that the US’s promotion of stablecoins aimed to protect the dollar’s international dominance and called on China to respond by incorporating an RMB-linked stablecoin into its national financial strategy. However, sentiment within China’s financial circles shifted after former PBoC governor Zhou Xiaochuan called for a cautious approach. Speaking at a closed-door financial forum in July, Zhou warned of the systemic risks associated with speculative use of stablecoins and questioned their real-world utility in payments. Zhou said they must guard against excessive speculation, emphasizing the need to evaluate the true demand for tokenization and its role within the broader financial system. Neither the PBoC nor the HKMA commented on the developments. The CAC, Ant Group, and JD.com also declined to comment on the requests.

The sharp retreat from its mid-October high of $126,251 has left traders cautious, but on-chain data reveals that major holders have been quietly capitalizing on the pullback. Despite the short-term uncertainty, analysts take the correction to be a classic accumulation window. Institutional wallets are buying the weakness as retail investors are fearful. Besides Bitcoin, whales are also rebalancing their portfolios into high ROI altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE , a project that is quickly gaining traction among smart-money investors looking to gain an edge before the next rally. BTC Price Analysis — $105K Support Zone Holds At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading around $106,756, up 1.7% in 24 hours, and daily volumes exceeded $82 billion. The asset has struggled to recover the $107,500 – $110,000 band that now acts as resistance. Analysts pointed out that a close above that zone could open the door toward $115,000 a day, while failure could send prices toward $101,000 or even $97,000. Source: CoinMarketCap This correction resembles the typical mid-cycle retracements of past bull markets. Historical data shows that after parabolic rallies, Bitcoin often experiences a 25% to 30% decline before resuming its upward trend. Long-term investors have been looking at these phases as technical resets, not breakdowns, so the $97,000 to $105,000 area may be an excellent range for accumulation. Whales Accumulate Amid Weak Sentiment On-chain trackers have picked up signs of aggressive accumulation by large wallets. Two new Bitcoin whales recently bought 1,465 BTC worth an estimated $162 million in six hours, withdrawing coins from Binance and FalconX to cold storage. https://x.com/spotonchain/status/1978772090129121353 Such synchronized inflows usually reflect institutional or high-net-worth buying. These players accumulate during high volatility levels, and they reflect belief in Bitcoin’s strength over the long term. Despite retail traders liquidating positions, whale activity has been on the rise, offering a clue that professional investors are using this dip to position themselves in advance of the next big breakout. Historically, whale accumulation during periods of high fear has preceded multi-week rallies as the supply tightens and confidence begins to return to the market. Fear and Greed Index Falls to 22 — A Classic Whale Opportunity The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has fallen to 22, the lowest it’s read since April, a signal of extreme fear. The metric combines data from volatility, market momentum, social sentiment, and Google Trends to gauge investor emotion. Extreme fear is often seen near market bottoms. It is a signal that retail investors are capitulating while deep-pocketed buyers are creeping in quietly. The last time this index touched similar levels, Bitcoin rebounded by more than 20% in three weeks. Analysts note that the same could be happening again as the whales capitalize on the panic as a long-term entry point. The current environment, therefore, favors accumulation, not exit. As traders are selling into weakness, institutions and whales are taking the opposite side of the trade – acquiring discounted coins and positioning upfront for the recovery phase. Beyond Bitcoin, whales are widening their strategy to include early-stage tokens that provide asymmetric returns. Analysts point to an increasing move towards high-ROI altcoins geared towards the next market rotation. Among these, MAGACOIN FINANCE has rapidly separated itself from typical presale projects . Its community growth and strategic tokenomics have made it a standout in current market conditions. The project’s presale momentum continues to accelerate, with smart-money wallets accumulating steadily during the broader market dip. Analysts describe MAGACOIN FINANCE as a “smart-money magnet” built for traders who buy early when others hesitate. Its model rewards disciplined investors through transparent supply mechanics and a community-driven growth plan. The ongoing wave of whale participation highlights confidence that MAGACOIN FINANCE could mirror early-cycle gains seen in 2020-era breakout tokens. This pattern, whale buying fear, has played out repeatedly in past cycles. Now, the same hands accumulating Bitcoin are also positioning in MAGACOIN FINANCE, suggesting it may be the next major beneficiary of capital rotation once sentiment improves. BTC Forecast — Key Levels to Watch Next Bitcoin’s short-term outlook hinges on the $101,000–$102,000 support zone. Holding that range would maintain structural strength ahead of a potential bounce toward $112,000–$115,000. Momentum indicators like the Stoch RSI show oversold conditions, reinforcing expectations of a relief rally if demand sustains. Analysts say accumulation patterns are forming across both BTC and select altcoins, pointing to an approaching sentiment reversal. Conclusion Bitcoin’s pullback has driven fear across the market, but whales view it as an opportunity, not a risk. Historical data support that extreme fear phases often precede accumulation and subsequent recovery. As retail traders exit, institutional buyers are quietly expanding exposure, both in Bitcoin and in emerging high-ROI projects such as MAGACOIN FINANCE. This convergence of whale activity suggests that while fear dominates headlines, smart money is already preparing for the market’s next major move.

The clip features Kristalina Georgieva, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), making direct remarks on the inevitability of digital money. Her comments have added weight to a conversation that has steadily moved from the fringes of finance to the center of policy discussions, and Aljarrah believes her stance on cryptocurrencies is part of a broader strategic coordination involving BlackRock and other major financial players. When you have the IMF Admitting crypto is inevitable, BlackRock Tokenizing the financial system, the FED hinting at ending QT, Gold doing a parabolic move & the FED hinting at renewed easing. This isn’t coincidence. This is strategic coordination. pic.twitter.com/4ye4FexiKF — Vandell | Black Swan Capitalist (@vandell33) October 17, 2025 Acceptance Over Resistance In the interview, Georgieva urged governments to confront the rapid evolution of money, stating that countries must “accept reality,” as fiat currency is moving digital . Her remarks align with a wider shift toward tokenized systems, an area where XRP and the XRP Ledger already demonstrate efficiency and superiority. She noted that developments in both backed and unbacked digital assets are advancing exponentially. Her view echoes Aljarrah’s, who described this moment as “strategic coordination” among the IMF, BlackRock, and the Federal Reserve. His observation ties Georgieva’s message to a broader movement where policy, liquidity, and technology are converging to form a new digital financial order. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A Convergence of Global Forces The coordination mirrors the environment XRP was built for. With major institutions exploring tokenized assets and digital payment infrastructure, the IMF’s acknowledgment of inevitable change lends credibility to utility-based networks like XRP. Its technology is already addressing the issues of settlement time and liquidity that global institutions are trying to solve through tokenization and blockchain. Her comments also arrive as asset managers, central banks, and regulators increasingly turn to blockchain to digitize and move value more efficiently. Her statement aligns with Ripple’s continued expansion into institutional-grade finance, where interoperability and real-world application determine long-term value. A Turning Point for Global Finance Georgieva’s guidance to IMF member states is to understand the digital transition and determine how to operate within it, which supports the need for regulation that allows compliant assets such as XRP to function alongside traditional systems. As central bank digital currencies and tokenized securities continue to develop, the demand for neutral and efficient bridge assets is likely to increase. Aljarrah’s interpretation of the IMF’s position as part of a coordinated financial shift aligns closely with XRP’s growing relevance. The digital transformation Georgieva described is no longer speculative and is actively taking shape across global markets. For XRP holders, her message affirms what the network was built to accomplish: a central role within the structure of an increasingly coordinated digital financial system.

He said that recent ADL events have proven profitable for users, producing hundreds of millions of dollars in total gains. A backstop liquidation mechanism, he stated, might have raised more HLP revenue, but it would have also amplified risk. He remarked, “On 10/10, Hyperliquid ADLs net made users hundreds of millions of dollars by closing profitable short positions at favorable prices. If more positions had been backstop liquidated, HLP could have made hundreds of millions of dollars more in pnl, while being exposed to an irresponsible amount of risk. “ He added that the ADL mechanism is structured to allow users to capture profits that might otherwise go to the system, all while reducing risk. Meanwhile, ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood praised Hyperliquid’s potential , comparing it to Solana’s early-stage promise, calling it “the new kid on the block.” She described the project as exciting and reminiscent of Solana’s formative years, noting that “Solana has proven its worth and is, you know, there with the big boys,” during a recent interview on the Master Investor podcast. Wood did not reveal any position in Hyperliquid but described the protocol as one to watch. Her comments come as competition among perpetual futures DEXs has intensified since Aster launched a token this month, driving its trading volume and open interest to surpass Hyperliquid’s. Jeff said the ADL queue on Hyperliquid works much like those used by CEXs Jeff noted that Hyperliquid’s ADL queue follows the same logic as many centralized exchanges (CEXs), combining leverage and unrealized pnl to determine the order of deleveraging. He thanked users for their feedback on ADL, adding that while valuable, many suggestions, such as offsetting correlated positions, would add extra complexity to the system. He highlighted that other major venues don’t typically employ a more complex ADL queue design, and simple systems are generally more resilient and easier for users to grasp. In late September, the exchange debuted its native stablecoin USDH, which traded nearly $2 million during the opening period. The stablecoin, backed by cash and U.S. government securities, leverages Stripe’s Bridge platform to manage reserves. Previously, the exchange had already slashed its spot trading fees by 80% as it sought to increase liquidity ahead of the stablecoin’s debut. The USDH ticker race began on Sept. 5, after Hyperliquid opened a governance process to decide the issuer. Native Markets arrived early, promising to issue a stablecoin on HyperEVM and allocate the reserve’s income between HYPE buybacks and ecosystem development. Soon after, bids rolled in from Paxos, Sky, Frax Finance, Agora, Curve, OpenEden, BitGo, and Ethena — the latter eventually withdrawing and backing Native Markets’ proposal. StandX’s TVL has crossed $200 million mark Meanwhile, Hyperliquid’s rival StandX smashes through the $200 million total value locked (TVL) within one month – now a world record for the platform. In addition to the milestone, StandX announced the kickstart of StandX Alpha, where early users are rewarded simply for signing up. The project was created by former members of Binance’s derivatives team and is designed to merge synthetic stablecoins with a decentralized perpetual exchange model. In a Saturday X post, Stand X announced , “New ATH achieved: $200,000,000 TVL in one month. StandX Alpha just went live. Stand in early for potential rewards.” Despite rising competition, Hyperliquid has become the newest fixation of both crypto traders and Wall Street. Designed for perpetual futures, it has already outperformed Coinbase in certain areas, despite being far smaller than it and Binance, while handling volumes within an industry that now exceeds $6 trillion a month. Tarun Chitra, founder of Gauntlet, recently noted that the highest growth rates are occurring in the newest and least established markets, largely because most existing participants have yet to understand their purpose.

The market has entered a period of consolidation between structural supports and resistances, suggesting that the next decisive move will likely be driven by liquidity displacement from this range. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, Ethereum continues to trade between two major zones: the institutional supply area around $4.6K–$4.7K and the institutional demand zone near $3.4K–$3.5K. After losing the channel’s lower trendline support earlier this month, the asset has now retested it from below, confirming it as resistance. The structure suggests that Ethereum is currently in a mid-range equilibrium phase, where neither buyers nor sellers have clear control. The 100-day MA, which previously provided dynamic support, has now flipped into a resistance zone near $4.1K–$4.2K, while the 200-day MA near $3.1K remains the last line of structural defence. As long as the price remains above the $3.4K institutional demand, Ethereum’s macro trend stays intact. However, failure to maintain this level could expose the market to a deeper retracement toward the $3.0K–$2.9K liquidity cluster, where the 200-day MA and prior accumulation base converge. The 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour structure reveals a descending wedge pattern, forming after a sharp rejection from the $4.2K breakdown zone. The repeated rejections at this confluence of descending and ascending trendlines reflect the ongoing tug-of-war between short-term buyers and sellers. At the same time, the lower boundary of the wedge aligns closely with the broader institutional demand zone, suggesting that Ethereum is approaching a point of compression where volatility expansion is imminent. If the price breaks above the descending trendline and closes above the $4K–$4.1K resistance, it could confirm a reversal, targeting $4.4K–$4.6K. Conversely, a breakdown below $3.7K would likely trigger a deeper decline toward $3.4K, the same zone that underpins the broader bullish structure. Until confirmation occurs, Ethereum remains range-bound, oscillating between structural supply and demand. Sentiment Analysis By Shayan Recent on-chain data points to a renewed tightening in Ethereum’s market structure. Since mid-October, two significant dynamics have emerged simultaneously: exchange reserves have declined sharply, while average spot order sizes have increasingly been dominated by large whale transactions. Following October 15, ETH’s price has remained relatively stable just below the $4K level, but the underlying market composition has shifted meaningfully. Whale-sized spot orders (green clusters) have expanded, signalling renewed activity from deep-pocketed participants, while the amount of Ethereum held on exchanges, measured in USD terms, has dropped to one of the lowest levels of 2025. This combination, shrinking exchange reserves and growing whale spot activity, has historically indicated strategic accumulation by institutional or high-net-worth investors. With liquidity thinning across exchanges, even moderate inflows of new demand could produce amplified price reactions, as reduced sell-side availability magnifies volatility to the upside. Ethereum now appears to be entering another supply squeeze phase, echoing the quiet but powerful accumulation period of late 2020. During that cycle, consistent spot buying and exchange outflows preceded one of ETH’s strongest multi-month rallies. If macro conditions stabilise and ETF-related inflows return, the current structural tightening could serve as the foundation for Ethereum’s next major upward cycle.

Key Takeaways: OpenSea will launch its SEA token in Q1 2026, with 50% of the supply allocated to the community and early users. The platform will use half of its revenue to buy back SEA tokens while allowing users to stake behind collections and projects. OpenSea’s pivot to a multi-chain trading aggregator reflects its shift from NFTs to broader crypto trading, now spanning 22 blockchains. In a recent post on X , Finzer said that half of SEA’s total supply will go to the community, with early users and reward program participants eligible for separate allocations. OpenSea to Use 50% of Revenue for SEA Buybacks, Adds Staking Utility The token will be fully integrated into OpenSea’s core ecosystem. Users will be able to stake SEA behind their favorite collections or projects, while 50% of OpenSea’s platform revenue will be used to buy back SEA tokens. The dual approach of staking and buybacks is intended to reinforce token utility and long-term value within the marketplace. The announcement comes as OpenSea continues to pivot from being the face of the NFT boom to a broader multi-chain trading aggregator. Once dominating digital art markets, the platform now supports 22 blockchains and recorded $2.6 billion in trading volume this month, over 90% of which came from token trading rather than NFTs. OpenSea’s repositioning follows the collapse of the NFT sector, where trading volumes have fallen more than 90% from their 2021 peak. The total market capitalization dropped from $20 billion in early 2022 to around $4.87 billion by October 2025, according to CoinGecko. OpenSea crossed $2.6B in trading volume this month, with over 90% from token trading. This is just the beginning of our transformation, from “NFT marketplace” to “trade everything.” NFTs were chapter one for us. In 2021, OpenSea brought the first wave of everyday internet users… — dfinzer.eth | opensea (@dfinzer) October 17, 2025 Finzer described the company’s pivot as both a necessity and an evolution . “You can’t fight the macro trend,” he said. “People want to trade everything—not just digital art.” OpenSea has recently introduced new tools, including a mobile app and perpetual futures trading, as part of its effort to position itself as a “trade-any-crypto” platform. The marketplace now aggregates buy and sell orders from decentralized exchanges like Uniswap and Meteora, generating roughly $16 million in revenue over the same period through a 0.9% transaction fee. The SEA token’s debut, delayed by more than a year, had fueled speculation across prediction markets like Polymarket. Following Finzer’s update, the odds of a 2025 token launch dropped from nearly 40% to under 1%. OpenSea’s Trading Volume Hits 3-Year High as Platform Reinvents Itself At the height of the NFT frenzy in January 2022, OpenSea generated $125 million in monthly revenue and was valued at $13.3 billion, making it one of the most valuable startups in crypto. But by late 2023, as interest in digital collectibles evaporated, its monthly revenue had fallen to just $3 million. The company was forced to lay off more than half of its staff , shrinking from about 175 employees to around 60 today. The downturn was accelerated by competition from rival marketplace Blur, which captured traders with zero fees and no royalties for creators . OpenSea’s response, loosening its own royalty structure , backfired, sparking backlash from artists and collectors who accused the company of abandoning its roots. Facing dwindling market share and financial strain, Finzer initiated a major reset. The company has since relocated its headquarters to Miami, with most staff working remotely. Additionally, in the first two weeks of October 2025, the company handled $1.6 billion in crypto trades and $230 million in NFT transactions, its biggest month in more than three years.

While most altcoins are relatively sluggish on a daily basis, the weekly performance shows a clearer and violent picture for many. BTC Back to $106K It has been a hell of a ride for the primary cryptocurrency that began on October 10 with a massive price plunge from over $121,000 to $110,000 on some exchanges and to $101,000 on others. The initial propeller was the threats by US President Trump against China, but the actual pain came as the overly leveraged market came undone. Nevertheless, BTC bounced off rather quickly and recovered some ground during the previous weekend. It kept climbing as the business week progressed and topped $116,000 on Tuesday. However, it was stopped there and pushed south to $110,000. This resistance held at first but was lost on Thursday when the bears drove it south to $108,000. Friday saw another leg down that this time resulted in a price dump to under $104,000 . The cryptocurrency finally reacted with a relief rally when Trump said the tariffs on China won’t stand. BTC pumped to $106,000 and even $107,000 yesterday, but was stopped and pushed south to the former as of now. Its market cap is down to $2.120 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts is just over 57%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Ups and Downs Most altcoins have remained sideways over the past day, but the weekly charts show a different picture. BNB is among the poorest performers, having lost 8% of value and trading below $1,100. BCH is down by 12%, while LINK, XLM, AVAX, HBAR, ADA, and XRP are also slightly in the red. In contrast, ETH, SOL, TRX, and DOGE are with minor weekly gains. More impressive increases came from the likes of MNT, WLFI, TAO, and ENA. The total crypto market cap is down to $3.7 trillion, which means it has erased roughly $500 billion in just over a week. Cryptocurrency Market Overview Weekly.

This outlook by cryptocurrency analyst TradingShot, XRP has been trading within a long-term ascending channel for nearly a year, but its recent price structure suggests growing downside risk. In an October 17 TradingView analysis , XRP was shown to be trading within a channel up pattern since late November 2024 but recently entered a second bearish phase after last week’s sell-off. XRP price analysis chart. Source: TradingView The price has broken below the mid-range of the ascending channel, signaling growing downward momentum. XRP key price levels to watch The analyst noted that a bearish crossover between the 1-day 50-day and 100-day moving averages has reinforced the negative outlook, echoing a similar signal earlier this year that drove XRP below the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level. If the current decline follows the same pattern as the previous drop, XRP could lose more than 50% from its recent levels. At the same time, fibonacci support levels point to a key downside target at $1.93, with a deeper slide potentially extending to $1.75, still within the broader ascending channel. The bearish outlook is reinforced by weak market sentiment, a lack of bullish catalysts, and renewed U.S.–China trade tensions, which continue to pressure risk assets. XRP price analysis By press time, XRP was trading at $2.32 having modestly plunged by about 1.5% in the past 24 hours while on the weekly timeline, XRP is also in the red at 3%.

The 14-day RSI at 30.25 signals weak buying momentum and rising selling pressure, though its proximity to oversold territory hints at the possibility of a short-term relief bounce.

Cryptocurrency trading has become increasingly popular globally. This has prompted several countries to consider establishing a system that allows banks to trade cryptocurrencies, just as they do with stocks and government bonds. *]:pointer-events-auto scroll-mt-[calc(var(--header-height)+min(200px,max(70px,20svh)))]"" dir=""auto"" data-turn-id=""request-WEB:b6746e21-c3d8-4ff5-ba09-b97fa827569f-133"" data-testid=""conversation-turn-4"" data-scroll-anchor=""true"" data-turn=""assistant""> The FSA also plans to introduce new rules to ensure financial stability within the banking sector. The final decision on bank participation in the crypto market will be discussed at an upcoming meeting of the Financial Services Council, which serves as an advisory body to the Prime Minister. Japan’s FSA intends to create a safer crypto space with banks Digital assets, such as Bitcoin , which lack a backing, tend to experience more significant price fluctuations than stocks and other assets. This has prompted several officials to raise concerns that banks may face significant losses if they hold substantial amounts of such cryptocurrencies in the event of sudden price drops, thereby endangering their financial stability. Therefore, being the main financial regulator in Japan, the FSA’s regulations, updated in 2020, primarily prevent bank groups from purchasing crypto assets for investment purposes. Still, the agency has announced plans to review regulations further based on how they impact banks’ financial status, even though owning and trading digital assets is permitted in the country. Regarding the FSA’s announcement to consider a system reform for the involvement of banks in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, reliable sources have highlighted that a working group will probably discuss developing a system to handle crypto-related risks. The sources also pointed out that the FSA will likely consider letting bank groups register as cryptocurrency exchange operators. These operators are assigned to provide services for trading and exchanging cryptocurrencies. By allowing trustworthy banking groups to join the cryptocurrency ecosystem, the FSA aims to create a safer and more conducive crypto environment for individual investors. Meanwhile, recent reports from reliable sources have acknowledged the rapid growth of cryptocurrency trading in Japan. These reports followed the FSA and other sources’ highlighting that more than 12 million cryptocurrency accounts were opened in the country in February of this year. This number is around 3.5 times more than the figures recorded five years ago. The FSA to end to insider trading in Japan This year, Japan has demonstrated a strong commitment to solidifying its position as a leader in the crypto ecosystem. Apart from the FSA considering reforms to permit banks to acquire and hold crypto assets for investment this month, the agency is also preparing to make significant amendments to the legal status of cryptocurrency to help combat insider trading . Insider trading in crypto refers to a situation where market participants carry out trades using confidential information unknown to the general public that originates within an organization. This act is considered illegal in Japan; therefore, the FSA plans to present a bill to the Parliament in 2026 to address this issue. This bill will introduce a minor legal change, but its impact on everything from Bitcoin to lesser-known meme coins could be substantial. The FSA has also made public its plans to set up a new Crypto Bureau next year to address future crypto-related issues. The recurring problem in the cryptocurrency ecosystem has always been insider trading, but it appears to be even more toxic recently. This follows a recent report that highlighted an unknown investor who profited significantly from Trump’s Black Friday tariff announcement, which has sparked intense anger within the community. While some nations, such as the US, are embracing an increasing tendency that “crime is legal now,” other nations are fighting against this trend. To support this claim, local news today reported that Japan is preparing to take a crucial step to reclassify cryptocurrency, aiming to prevent insider trading fully.

One project gaining increasing attention is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi crypto protocol, priced at just $0.035. Analysts and early participants are closely watching the project, with some suggesting that if its roadmap executes successfully, the token could generate up to 9,900% token appreciation from its $0.01 starting price over the long term. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being positioned as a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol built on Ethereum, designed to create secure, efficient, and scalable credit markets. What sets it apart is its dual-market structure, which blends two complementary lending systems into a single platform. Through Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pooled liquidity markets, users can deposit major assets such as ETH and USDT to earn passive yield while enabling borrowers to access funds via an algorithmic interest rate model. At the same time, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) isolated lending markets cater to less common tokens, giving institutional participants and advanced traders more control over risk exposure. This integrated approach allows Mutuum Finance to support both everyday users seeking predictable yield opportunities and larger players requiring customized credit environments. Borrowing rates on the platform are automatically adjusted depending on how much liquidity is being used. When liquidity is plentiful, borrowing rates stay low to encourage activity. As liquidity tightens, rates increase to incentivize new deposits. On the lending side, APYs rise with usage, rewarding early liquidity providers who help bootstrap the system. Another key component is the buy-and-distribute model, which uses a portion of platform fees to purchase MUTM tokens from the open market and redistribute them to mtToken stakers. This creates a continuous cycle of demand, linking real platform activity to token value — something many speculative tokens lack. Detailed Presale Momentum and Early Progress Mutuum Finance has already raised an impressive $17.6 million, reflecting strong early momentum since the presale began in early 2025. The project has attracted more than 17,300 holders and steadily advanced through its structured sale model, which offers transparent pricing and clear incentives for early participants. The MUTM token is currently priced at $0.035 in Phase 6, up from $0.01 in Phase 1, a nearly 3x MUTM surge for those who joined at the very beginning. So far, 66% of Phase 6 has been allocated, and once it sells out, the price will climb by nearly 20%, bringing it closer to the planned $0.06 listing price. This structured progression has given investors both visibility and motivation to act early, as each stage offers a lower entry point than the next. To boost engagement, Mutuum Finance runs a 24-hour leaderboard system. Each day, the top depositor earns a $500 MUTM bonus, provided they complete at least one transaction during that period. The board resets at 00:00 UTC, keeping participants active throughout the presale. Additionally, the project confirmed through an X statement that Version 1 of its protocol will launch on the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025, featuring liquidity pools, mtToken issuance, debt tokens, and automated liquidation mechanisms. ETH and USDT will be supported from day one, laying the groundwork for a strong initial rollout. The team has also backed up its growth strategy with strong security foundations. Mutuum Finance underwent a CertiK audit, achieving an impressive 90/100 token score, and launched a $50,000 bug bounty to encourage independent testing of code before mainnet. These measures have helped build early trust among investors. Key Price Catalysts Mutuum Finance’s long-term roadmap goes beyond its initial protocol launch. One of the most anticipated developments is the introduction of an over-collateralized stablecoin, designed to bring more stability to lending and borrowing activities. A portion of the platform’s revenue will be used to buy MUTM on the open market, helping to support token demand over time. Additionally, the team is planning Layer-2 network integration, which will reduce transaction fees, speed up execution, and expand accessibility to more users. Combined with robust oracle infrastructure powered by Chainlink and fallback feeds for accurate pricing, these upgrades are expected to strengthen the protocol’s foundation significantly. Analysts believe that as long as these plans are executed well, MUTM could trade between $0.75 and $1.00 by 2027, representing a 20–28x increase from the current presale price and a 75–100x increase from the $0.01 Phase 1 price. Such growth projections are fueling whale interest, especially as the project continues to hit key milestones. Why Analysts Compare MUTM to Early Giants Industry experts often draw parallels between Mutuum Finance and early-stage versions of major DeFi protocols, which achieved exponential growth once their core products launched. The combination of a clear token utility, strong tokenomics, and timely execution has historically been a winning formula in the crypto industry. Mutuum Finance’s presale performance, protocol design, and roadmap milestones mirror many of those early success stories. With Phase 6 already 70% allocated and whales taking positions early, the timing factor is becoming increasingly important. Historically, some of the largest returns in crypto investing have gone to those who secured their positions before major catalysts and market adoption.

Notably, the proposed cryptocurrency is designed as a key part of OpenSea’s transformation to a one-stop shop for any blockchain-related trading activity. Related Reading: Florida’s Crypto Bill Gets A Second Life—But Will It Work This Time? OpenSea To Distribute 50% Token Supply To Community In an X post on October 18, Devin Finzer shared key information on OpenSea’s long-awaited SEA token covering its utility, distribution, and tokenomics. The token was first announced in February 2025, as its launch is set to come year after. According to details shared by Finzer, 50% of SEA’s total supply will be distributed to the OpenSea community, with at least half of this allocation going toward initial claimants. Meanwhile, OGs and participants in the platform’s rewards program will be considered separately, recognizing their long-term engagement and contributions to the marketplace. The OpenSea CEO also revealed that 50% of the company’s revenue at launch will be used to purchase SEA tokens, establishing an immediate demand mechanism to support the token’s value and liquidity. In terms of functionality, SEA will be integrated into the marketplace’s core experience, allowing users to stake tokens and engage more deeply with their favorite collections. A Multi-Chain Trading Project As earlier stated, SEA represents an integral component in OpenSea’s proposed operation to function as a one-stop shop for blockchain trading. Finzer provides additional depth to this project, which aims to move OpenSea from being an “NFT marketplace” to a general trading platform. The OpenSea boss describes NFTs as the first phase before a sequel that will provide users seamless access to the on-chain economy to trade all objects, including tokens, culture, art, and ideas, among others. Finzer said: Building that product is in our DNA. You shouldn’t have to use a CEX and give up custody of your assets. But you also shouldn’t need to navigate a maze of chains, bridges, wallets, and protocols in order to use onchain liquidity, wondering whether your balance is on Solana, an Ethereum L2, or somewhere else. The OpenSea boss also explains the importance of the SEA token to this project, saying You should just be able to trade everything in one place, seamlessly. And that brings me to $SEA , from the OpenSea Foundation. Integrating $SEA into OpenSea will be the opportunity to show the world our vision. It will shine a spotlight on everything we’re building. So we need to make damn sure that what we’ve built deserves that spotlight — not just for us, but for every holder who believes in what crypto can become. $SEA is not being created to be launched and forgotten. Meanwhile, OpenSea now boasts over $2.6 billion in October 2025, 90% of which was generated from token trading.

Something Big Is Coming,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-to-xrp-holders-a-big-shakeout-and-sudden-800-rise-something-big-is-coming/,"Crypto analyst {x} (@unknowDLT) has drawn parallels between XRP’s current market structure and a significant price movement from October 2024. According to his analysis, the asset’s recent decline and rapid rebound mirror a pattern that previously led to an 800% surge. His attached chart highlights the correction of nearly 27% followed by a sharp recovery, suggesting that XRP could be entering a similar phase once again. The analyst noted that in October last year, XRP experienced a substantial shakeout before beginning a strong upward trend. He believes this current setup reflects that same sequence, but with the potential for a different magnitude of results due to current market catalysts. In October last year, the price of XRP did exactly what it is doing now. A big shakeout followed by a sudden rise (+800%) But this time the sudden rise will be different, coinciding with ETFs (supply shock) and the implementation of ISO20022 (probable DLT adoption). pic.twitter.com/2l6qBSvNi0 — {x} (@unknowDLT) October 17, 2025 Catalysts Driving the Potential Move Unlike the previous rally, the analyst pointed out that this period may align with two major developments: the anticipated launch of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on October 24 and the full implementation of the ISO 20022 financial messaging standard on November 22. He described these events as potential triggers for a supply shock and accelerated distributed ledger technology (DLT) adoption, which could amplify XRP’s market movement. The chart he shared shows XRP rebounding sharply from the $0.48 level after the correction, climbing above $0.60 within a short period. This upward move forms the technical foundation for his projection that the current cycle could replicate or even surpass the previous one. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community Insights and Reactions Other analysts and traders joined the discussion to expand on this thesis. X user Crypto Dog commented that last year’s October correction served as the foundation for the 800% surge and suggested that the conditions this time are even more favorable. He pointed to the timing of the ETF release and the ISO 20022 activation as critical elements that could accelerate adoption and demand. He concluded that these factors could position Ripple’s ecosystem to redefine digital payment infrastructure within Web3. Another user, Brandon, referenced XRP’s historical structure from 2017, arguing that the current macroeconomic backdrop and institutional readiness make the setup fundamentally stronger. He emphasized that the broader infrastructure is now capable of absorbing institutional capital flow, making this market phase structurally distinct from prior cycles. The convergence of these technical and fundamental indicators has led several analysts to anticipate significant volatility in the coming weeks. If ETF approvals coincide with ISO 20022’s global rollout, XRP could experience accelerated market participation and renewed institutional interest.

53367349,https://invezz.com/?p=2931534,1760868660,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Top crypto market news to watch this week,https://invezz.com/news/2025/10/19/top-crypto-market-news-to-watch-this-week/,"The crypto market was highly volatile last week as investors reacted to the recent liquidation that cost investors at least $19 billion in a single day. This week will likely be more volatile for the industry as investors react to some notable news. This article highlights some of the best crypto news to watch this week. Crypto market to react to US inflation data The first main crypto news to consider this week will be the US inflation data, which will come out on Friday. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has pledged to publish this report despite the ongoing government shutdown because of the implications on the social security. This data is important during the calculation of the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA). Analysts expect the report to show that the headline consumer price index (CPI) jumped from 2.9% in August to 3.1% in September. The core CPI, which excludes the volatile food and energy products, is expected to move from 3.1% to 3.2%. If these numbers are accurate, they will have an impact on the Federal Reserve, which will deliver its interest rate decision a week later. The crypto market does well when the Federal Reserve is cutting interest rates. Top token unlocks Cryptocurrency prices are normally affected by token unlocks, which increase the number of coins in circulation. Token unlocks are normally bearish, especially during a bar market. Hundreds of tokens will be unlocked this week. Data compiled by DeFi Llama shows that tokens worth over $212 million will be unlocked in the next seven days. The figure will likely be much higher as the platform does not capture all the unlocks. Some of the top tokens with large unlocks this week are LayerZero, which will unlock tokens worth over $40 million, representing 21% of those in circulation, TON, Kaito, EigenLayer, Mantra, Avalanche, and Axelar. Crypto liquidations The other notable catalyst for the crypto market will be liquidations, which have remained at an elevated level recently. Over 1.6 million traders were liquidated on Friday as the crypto market crash accelerated. Total liquidations that day jumped to over $20 billion. Another 300k traders were liquidated last Friday as the amount jumped to over $1 billion. The soaring liquidations explain why the crypto market pulled back last week as many of the liquidated ones stayed in the sidelines. Another surge in liquidations will likely drag the crypto market this week. US and China trade talks Meanwhile, the crypto market will react to the progress on US-China trade talks . Scott Bessent, the Treasury Secretary, confirmed that teams from the two sides will meet in Malaysia to prepare for the meeting between Donald Trump and China. These talks are important as they will likely lead to de-escalation between the two sides. They will come at a time when China has spotted its leverage on the US and is using it to the maximum. For example, it has unveiled measures to limit rare earth materials, a move that would impact US manufacturing. It has also announced targeted tariffs and an investigation on some companies. A deal between the US and China would be highly bullish for the crypto market as it would reduce one of the top risks today. It will also lead to higher chances that the Federal Reserve will cut rates.

The purchase is coming amid Fundstrat’s Tom Lee’s sentiment that digital assets treasury hype might be on its last legs. However, he maintained that he remains bullish on Ethereum as the market continues to move slowly. According to reports, since the liquidation event that enveloped the market last weekend, BitMine has accumulated about 379,271 Ethereum, which is currently worth almost $1.5 billion in today’s market. The BitMine acquisition came in three separate purchases. The company purchased 202,037 ETH after the weekend crash, 104,336 ETH on Thursday, and 72,898 ETH on Saturday, according to data from on-chain platform Arkham Intelligence. While the purchases were also made public by BMNR Bullz, which tracks BitMine’s purchases, the firm has yet to confirm the purchases officially. BitMine makes $1.5 billion ETH purchase post-crash BitMine is one of the largest Ethereum treasury companies in the world, with a stash of more than three million ETH. The total cache represents about 2.5% of the entire supply, worth $11.7 billion. The company is currently halfway towards its target of owning at least 5% of the total Ethereum in circulation, with BitMine only kick-starting the acquisition of the asset around July 2025, when the asset was selling for around $2,500. In an earlier interview, Lee claimed that Ethereum could eventually surpass Bitcoin’s market share, noting the way US equities overtook gold 54 years ago as a perfect example. He highlighted that it made the US abandon the gold standard. “Ethereum could flip Bitcoin, similar to how Wall Street and equities flipped gold post 71,” Lee told ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood on Thursday in his latest bullish statement on the asset. Presently, Bitcoin’s market cap is about five times larger than Ethereum’s. Lee also echoed the same sentiment as BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, noting that Ethereum has what it takes to hit $10,000. Lee claimed in an interview that the asset has what it takes to still hit that figure this year, despite the recent market crash, and there being less than three months left to close out the year. “For Ethereum, somewhere between [$10,000] and $12,000,” Lee said on the Bankless podcast, when he was asked where the cryptocurrency’s price could trade by the end of this year. Lee predicts continued aggressive accumulation of ETH Lee also claimed that he still sees the continued aggressive accumulation of Ethereum despite his previous opinion that the digital asset treasury bubble may have burst. Speaking to Fortune recently, Lee mentioned that many digital asset treasuries (DAT) are trading below their net asset value (NAV), or the worth of their underlying crypto holdings. “If that’s not already a bubble burst … How would that bubble burst?” he added. According to a report from research firm 10x Research, major DATs such as Metaplanet and Strategy were trading near or below their NAVs. The research firm released the report on Saturday, but noted that it is not all bad news for DATs with strong capital bases. It added that trading-savvy management teams may still generate meaningful alpha. Meanwhile, Huobi founder Li Lin wants some of the alpha and has reportedly raised $1 billion to invest in an Ethereum treasury. Lee also mentioned after the trading day on Friday that investors were still “licking their wounds” from the record leverage flush, noting that there was still some gold envy, seeing as the commodity has posted impressive performances across the year. “This is not the top of the crypto cycle, but leveraged longs in crypto are near record lows, so I think we’re at the basement and working our way back up,” he said. Crypto markets are currently down about 15% from their October 7 record high, while gold prices have dropped 3% from their Thursday peak.

One such promising project in this cycle is Mutuum Finance (MUTM), currently priced at an accessible $0.035 per token during its presale phase. Following the tradition of early-stage investment success stories like Solana and Aave, Mutuum Finance aims to carve its niche by basing its growth on concrete utility and protocol milestones rather than mere market speculation. What Makes Mutuum Finance Stand Out? Mutuum Finance, a decentralized finance protocol, employs a distinct strategy focused on structured presale stages and real utility within the DeFi ecosystem. The protocol operates on a transparent model where early participants benefit from initial pricing and rewards, setting the stage for a potential surge in value as the project reaches new milestones. Currently in its sixth presale phase, MUTM has attracted substantial attention, raising $17.4 million with more than 17,200 holders. The interest in Mutuum Finance is bolstered by daily engagement incentives such as a $500 MUTM bonus for the highest depositor of the day, driving consistent transaction activity. Protocol and Utility Features MUTM integrates Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending frameworks, supporting major assets like ETH and USDT, alongside less common tokens. This architectural blend caters to a broad user base from casual users to professional traders, reminiscent of other successful DeFi protocols. The protocol issues mtTokens as a 1:1 receipt for assets supplied, which not only maintain the value but also accrue interest over time, enhancing user returns. A unique aspect of Mutuum Finance is its buy-and-distribute mechanism, wherein a part of the borrowing fees and protocol revenue is used to purchase MUTM from the market and redistribute it to mtToken holders, creating continual demand and enhancing token value. Upcoming Developments and Analyst Perspectives As part of its roadmap, Mutuum Finance is set to launch Version 1 on the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025, with key functionalities like liquidity pools and liquidation systems. This phase is critical for initial user feedback and operational refinement before progressing to mainnet launches. Analysts are optimistic, projecting that post-launch, MUTM's value could rise significantly. Investments made during the presale could potentially yield substantial returns, drawing parallels with early investments in other prominent DeFi tokens. Security and Community Engagement The protocol's commitment to security is evidenced by a successful audit by CertiK and a $50,000 bug bounty aimed at ensuring robust contract security prior to full-scale implementation. A concurrent $100,000 giveaway helps to stimulate community interest and participation, ensuring a lively and engaged stakeholder base from the outset. Conclusion With its strategic presale ongoing and significant developments on the horizon, Mutuum Finance presents a compelling case for both retail and institutional investors looking for the next big opportunity in DeFi.

Many of the most successful stories share a common thread: they were discovered while still in their presale phase, long before exchange listings or major marketing pushes. In 2020, investors who identified Solana early saw life-changing gains. In 2021, early Aave backers watched the protocol reshape DeFi lending markets. Now, in 2025, a new Ethereum-based project called Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is drawing similar attention. With a current presale price of just $0.035, rapidly increasing allocations, and major protocol milestones ahead, some analysts believe this could be one of the defining DeFi crypto stories of the next cycle. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol designed to bring a more structured, utility-driven approach to token value. Instead of relying on hype alone, the team has built its growth strategy around transparent presale mechanics, verifiable on-chain milestones, and clear utility. The presale has been running since early 2025 and has already demonstrated impressive traction. MUTM is currently priced at $0.035 in Phase 6, up from $0.01 in Phase 1. To date, the project has raised $17.4 million, attracted over 17,200 holders, and allocated 66% of the Phase 6 tokens. Once Phase 6 is fully subscribed, the token price will rise by nearly 20%, moving closer to the planned $0.06 listing price. This structured approach gives early participants transparent pricing and rewards those who enter before key milestones. To keep engagement high, Mutuum Finance runs a 24-hour leaderboard. Each day, the top depositor receives a $500 MUTM bonus, provided they complete at least one transaction in that period. This feature has proven effective at maintaining daily activity from both retail buyers and larger participants, contributing to steady momentum as the presale progresses. MUTM Could Be the Next DeFi Success Story Unlike many speculative tokens, MUTM is built around real, protocol-driven utility. Its architecture combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pooled markets for major assets like ETH and USDT with Peer-to-Peer (P2P) isolated lending markets for less common tokens. This dual structure is designed to serve both everyday users and more sophisticated participants, a strategy reminiscent of how major DeFi protocols reshaped decentralized markets. Another key feature is the mtToken system. When users supply assets, they receive 1:1 receipt tokens called mtTokens, which accrue yield over time. These tokens allow users to maintain exposure to their deposits while earning interest — similar to how Aave’s aTokens function, but adapted for Mutuum’s dual-market structure. Complementing this is the buy-and-distribute mechanism. A portion of borrowing fees and protocol revenue is used to buy MUTM from the open market and redistribute it to mtToken stakers, creating a continuous loop of demand tied to real platform activity. This is a major difference from meme coins or hype tokens, whose price movements often rely solely on sentiment. Analysts View The team has also confirmed through an X statement that Version 1 of the protocol will launch on the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. This rollout will feature core components such as liquidity pools, mtToken issuance, debt tokens, and liquidation systems — with ETH and USDT supported from day one. Analysts view this as a crucial step to gather feedback, build user familiarity, and demonstrate real functionality before mainnet and exchange listings. Many analysts have shared price projections for MUTM based on these fundamentals. Conservative models place post-launch momentum between $0.25 and $0.35, while more aggressive forecasts suggest $0.50 is possible over the longer term as long as adoption mirrors early Aave or Compound growth. To illustrate this potential, consider a $650 crypto investment at the current presale price of $0.035. If MUTM reaches $0.25 post-launch, that investment could grow to $4,642. At $0.35, the same position would be worth $6,500, showing why early positioning in strong utility projects can offer asymmetric upside compared to already mature tokens. Security, Incentives, and Community Engagement Mutuum Finance has also taken steps to build trust with investors before launch. The project underwent a CertiK audit, achieving a strong 90/100 token score, which signals a solid codebase and responsible development practices. In addition, the team launched a $50,000 bug bounty to encourage independent security researchers to review the smart contracts. This early emphasis on transparency and risk mitigation aligns Mutuum with established DeFi protocols that prioritized security from day one. On the community side, a $100,000 giveaway is running during the presale period. Ten winners will be selected to receive $10,000 worth of MUTM each, boosting awareness and rewarding early supporters. Combined with the daily leaderboard, these programs are designed to create consistent activity and attract a broad mix of retail and whale participants ahead of listing. The presale is currently entering a critical phase. With Phase 6 already two-thirds allocated, whale inflows in the six-figure range have been observed in recent weeks, signaling growing institutional interest. Mutuum Finance’s combination of transparent fundraising, utility, audited security, and strategic rollout gives it a foundation that analysts believe could make it one of the standout DeFi crypto projects of 2025.

Key Takeaways: Fundstrat’s Tom Lee remains bullish on Ethereum, purchasing $1.5 billion worth of ETH. BitMine Immersion Technologies mirrored the move, buying 379,000 ETH worth $1.5 billion. Lee warned that many DATs are now trading below their net asset value, signaling a possible bubble burst. The veteran strategist revealed that he purchased $1.5 billion worth of Ether following last weekend’s market crash, doubling down on what he sees as a long-term opportunity, he said in an interview with Fortune . BitMine Accumulates 379,000 ETH Worth $1.5B According to on-chain data from Arkham Intelligence, Bitcoin mining firm BitMine Immersion Technologies made the same move, accumulating 379,271 ETH worth roughly $1.5 billion across three major purchases over the week. The transactions included 202,037 ETH acquired right after the market liquidation, followed by 104,336 ETH on Thursday and another 72,898 ETH on Saturday. While BitMine has not yet confirmed the transactions, tracking account “BMNR Bullz” reported consistent wallet activity linked to the company. BitMine has quickly become the largest Ether treasury holder, now sitting on more than 3 million ETH, or about 2.5% of the total supply, valued at around $11.7 billion. The firm began accumulating the asset in early July when prices were near $2,500, and it aims to eventually control 5% of all Ether in circulation. MASSIVE ETHEREUM ACCUMULATION Bitmine just went ALL IN on $ETH scooping up a total of 379,271 ETH ($1.48B) during the dip! +72,898 ETH ($281M) yesterday's dip +104,336 ETH ($417M) 3 days ago +202,037 ETH after the weekend crash Tom Lee wasn’t joking when he said… pic.twitter.com/oiyhLO79wk — BMNR Bullz (@BMNRBullz) October 18, 2025 Speaking with ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood, Lee compared Ethereum’s potential to how Wall Street transitioned from gold to equities after 1971. “Ethereum could flip Bitcoin similar to how Wall Street and equities flipped gold post ’71,” he said, suggesting Ether may become the dominant store of value in the next market cycle. However, Lee also acknowledged growing cracks in the DAT market. He noted that many digital asset treasury companies are now trading below their net asset value (NAV), implying investors have begun to price in the risks of overvaluation. “If that’s not already a bubble burst… How would that bubble burst?” he asked during an interview with Fortune. Research from 10x Research supports this view, pointing out that firms like Metaplanet and Strategy are trading at or below their NAVs . Yet, the report added that well-capitalized DATs with experienced management could still outperform in the next phase of the cycle. Huobi Founder Li Lin Raises $1B With Partners to Accumulate Ethereum Meanwhile, Huobi founder Li Lin has reportedly raised $1 billion to launch an Ether-focused treasury fund. Li, who also chairs Avenir Capital, is working alongside Shen Bo, co-founder of Fenbushi Capital; Xiao Feng, chairman and CEO of HashKey Group; and Cai Wensheng, the founder of photo-editing app Meitu Inc. and one of China’s most prominent crypto investors. The group plans to structure the Ether trust through a Nasdaq-listed shell company, providing a regulated framework for institutional participation. The project has already raised about $1 billion, including $500 million from HongShan Capital Group (formerly Sequoia China) and $200 million from Li’s Avenir, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because discussions remain private.

Industry Members Respond,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/are-bitcoin-miners-now-abandoning-btc-to-work-on-artificial-intelligence-industry-members-respond/,"Shares of the large-scale mining companies that power the Bitcoin network are once again outperforming BTC itself, driven by the companies' increasing shift toward hybrid models centered on artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC). These companies, once called “miners” in analogy with mining traditional commodities like gold, have long been vulnerable to wild swings in the price of Bitcoin. The sector, which benefited from the first wave of the AI boom in 2023, saw its stock decline the following year as profits plummeted and competition intensified. However, the landscape has changed in 2025. Despite the crypto market's decline in recent weeks, Bitcoin is up 14% this year and is close to the record high of $126,000 reached at the beginning of the month. The Trump administration's pro-cryptocurrency policies during its second term have revived investors' interest in Bitcoin. Yet, the real winners this year haven't been BTC, but rather mining companies. An index tracking mining companies has risen over 150% since the beginning of the year. Experts say investors are now viewing these companies not simply as miners but as “technology infrastructure companies.” “Investors are currently evaluating Bitcoin miners almost entirely on HPC and AI opportunities. Less than 10% of the topics we discuss are related to Bitcoin mining,” said John Todaro, an analyst at Needham & Co. Among the most prominent examples of this transformation are Cipher Mining and IREN. Shares of the two Nasdaq-listed companies have risen by 300% and 500%, respectively, this year. At the beginning of the year, Cipher signed a 10-year, approximately $3 billion collaboration agreement with Google-backed Fluidstack. Under the agreement, Fluidstack received $1.4 billion in lease guarantees in exchange for a 5.4% equity option. This agreement is being interpreted as one of the clearest indicators of the growing intertwining of crypto mining and AI computing. Singapore-based Bitdeer Technologies Group surged nearly 30% on Wednesday. The company plans to convert several mining sites, including its 570-megawatt Clarington facility in Ohio, into AI data centers. Bitdeer said this transformation could generate over $2 billion in annual revenue by the end of 2026 in a best-case scenario. “AI and HPC are not replacing mining; they are complementing it. We will transform by selecting facilities whose profitability is sustainable over the long term,” said Jeff LaBerge, vice president of capital markets and strategy at Bitdeer. This strategic shift by miners accelerated after the Bitcoin halving in 2024. The decrease in the reward per block from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, combined with increased network difficulty and decreasing transaction volumes, severely narrowed profit margins. Related News: Founder of This Altcoin Bought a Significant Amount of His Own Token: The Price Chart Turned Green TheMinerMag analyst Wolfie Zhao noted that many companies are now turning to more efficient use of existing energy capacity rather than increasing hash rate, saying, “Companies like Riot Platforms, IREN, and Bitfarms aren't planning to increase their hash power in the near term. The focus has shifted from 'how much hash can we add' to 'how efficiently can we use energy'.” “Revenue per megawatt and EBITDA margins are much higher in AI and HPC compared to mining,” said Needham analyst Todaro. “Due to Bitcoin's volatility and halving risks, capital markets are now valuing AI-focused data centers much higher than traditional miners.” *This is not investment advice.

With Bitcoin’s dominance now re-tested and major capital pouring in, smart investors are asking: if the king is stabilising, what about the crown jewels below? This is the pivot point for those hunting the next wave of high-volatility, high-reward opportunities: altcoins. One of these is Remittix , which many experts say is the best crypto to buy now. The Underlying Signal: Bitcoin’s Setup Bitcoin dipped below $110,000 after soaring past $126,000. This has prompted some analysts to question what becomes of the crypto market at a time like this. Meanwhile, on-chain metrics indicate that a bottom might be. This matters because when Bitcoin enters a consolidation area, smart money often rotates into high-growth crypto. In such a case, undervalued crypto projects and DeFi projects are positioned to move with the altcoin wave. If that rotation is happening now, you want to be positioned early. The Breakout Candidate: Remittix (RTX) – The PayFi Gamechanger Remittix is a centralised exchanges-ready, cross-chain DeFi project set to disrupt payments. It’s emerging as potentially the next big altcoin for investors who don’t want to wait for mainstream listing. It already boasts strong presale momentum, community growth, and key listings on the horizon. It’s being dubbed by analysts as the “XRP 2.0”, with increasingly mainstream investor interest backing its utility-driven roadmap rather than simple speculation. Because of that, early-stage crypto investment into Remittix not only offers high upside but positions you ahead of the wave. Core features that stand out: Global Reach: Send crypto directly to bank accounts in 30+ countries Real-World Utility: Built for actual payments, not just exchange speculation Security First: Audited by CertiK and ranked #1 for pre-launch tokens Wallet Coming: Mobile-first experience with real-time FX conversion Supports 40+ cryptos and 30+ fiat currencies at launch In short, Remittix connects the crypto world with real-life payments — something every investor says is missing in many “next big altcoin in 2025” stories. Comparatively, while Ethereum and Solana scale infrastructure and XRP focuses on payments rails, Remittix zooms into the ‘crypto-to-bank-account’ lane. If altcoins are due for a move, this is the kind of project that stands to benefit from the next phase of growth. $250,000 Giveaway & Referral Rush – Don’t Miss This Entry Window Early access to Remittix’s ecosystem has perks. The team has announced a $250,000 giveaway as part of a broader campaign to onboard referrals. Every time you refer a new buyer, you’ll get 15% of their purchase in USDT, instantly claimable daily. That’s not just hype — it’s a direct incentive to participate now. With over 25,000 token holders and 300,000+ entries on the giveaway Gleam page, the window is narrowing. Some early backers are already talking about five-digit rewards through the referral program alone. Combined with strong presale numbers (crossing $27.5 million+) and imminent listings on exchanges like BitMart & LBank, the timing is critical.

With institutional adoption accelerating and regulatory clarity improving, traders believe XRP could be gearing up for another major breakout. Meanwhile, a new contender dubbed “ XRP 2.0 ” is catching attention for its real-world payments innovation. Ripple Price Prediction Sees $5 To $10 Range As Next Target Fresh XRP news has reignited excitement across the market after reports revealed Ripple’s $1 billion acquisition of a corporate treasury management firm. The move signals a massive leap toward institutional adoption and could reshape the XRP price prediction narrative for 2025. As Ripple integrates its technology into global treasury systems, analysts believe this could unlock new liquidity demand for XRP price and corporate settlements. The deal marks Ripple’s most strategic push yet beyond remittances, expanding into enterprise-level payment rails and financial management solutions. Educators like “X Finance Bull” suggest that Ripple price prediction models could target $2 to $3 soon, $5 to $10 in the medium term, and potentially $20 to $100+ if institutional adoption accelerates. While regulation and execution remain key hurdles, the growing clarity from courts and global markets is helping Ripple price forecasts stay bullish. If adoption scales as projected, Ripple could finally break into mainstream finance. This will position XRP price today as one of the strongest long-term setups heading into 2025. Remittix Positions Itself As The Future Of Global Crypto Payments While traders speculate on XRP price prediction for 2025, many are starting to view Remittix (RTX) as the next big payments-focused crypto, and for good reason. The project has already raised over $27.5 million and sold 679 million tokens, showing consistent demand in a shaky market. Built as a PayFi protocol, Remittix lets users convert crypto into fiat instantly, connecting wallets directly to global bank accounts without relying on intermediaries like SWIFT or Western Union. Analysts say this is exactly the kind of real-world utility that helped Ripple thrive — and now, Remittix is stepping into that same space with a modern edge. BitMart confirmed as the first CEX listing, with LBank also announced $27.5M milestone achieved with growing investor confidence CertiK verified and officially ranked #1 for pre-launch tokens 15% USDT Referral Program live with daily claimable rewards The Remittix Wallet beta is now live, marking the start of real adoption before listings go live. With its $250,000 Giveaway, working infrastructure, and cross-border payment utility, Remittix is earning the nickname “XRP 2.0” for its focus on scalability, transparency, and utility-driven growth. As Ripple expands into corporate finance, Remittix is building the rails for the next era of global blockchain payments.

According to market analysts, as long as ETH can recover the lost ground of $4,000, then it will be the first good indication of the revival of strength. Although there are short-term fluctuations and ETF outflows, investor sentiment is optimistic in the long term. With Ethereum consolidation, it has become more about the booming presale of MAGACOIN FINANCE , which has now raised over $17 million. Ethereum Attempts a Technical Recovery After recovering on the $3,650 support zone in the early part of this week, Ethereum is trading at the area around $3,950. Coingecko data indicates that ETH has gained almost 2% within the last 24 hours with buyers protecting major support levels. Market commentator @TedPillows, on X, wrote that ETH experienced a bullish recovery off the $3,600-$3,700 level. In case it retrieves $4,000, it will be an initial message of power. Source: X Meanwhile, ETF data reflect a $232 million outflow by U.S. Ethereum funds, with BlackRock recording a sales level of more than $146 million. Nevertheless, there are analysts who are still optimistic of recovery targets within the medium term.’ This is an Ethereum textbook set-up, Ted added. My wave-5 goal will be $5,200, followed by $6,000 at the end of a year.” According to market analysts, the psychological barrier is at the $4,000 mark. In case Ethereum continues to stay higher than the 20-day moving average, the next level of resistance will be around $4,300-$4,400. Nevertheless, the inability to re-evaluate above the 3,800 will clear the way to another test of the $3,600 region before another push up. New Ethereum Treasury Plans Emerge in Asia According to Bloomberg, a group of influential Asian investors is already planning to roll out a 1 billion Ethereum treasury. The project includes Li Lin, the founder of Huobi and chairman of Avenir Capital, who has become a member of a group of local crypto leaders. Other members of the group are HashKey Group CEO Xiao Feng, co-founder of Fenbushi Capital Shen Bo, and co-founder of Meitu Inc Cai Wensheng. According to the sources , institutional participants have already made commitments totaling to approximately 1 billion of capital. This is in addition to the $500 million raised by HongShan Capital Group, which was once known as Sequoia China and $200 million raised by the Avenir Capital. Analysts interpret the action as a great act of confidence in the long-term network worth of Ethereum, particularly following the recent market decline. Market researcher @Cryptocium_id commented that the weekly structure still favors accumulation.“Ethereum is retesting its 20-day moving average for the second time now,” the post read. Such retests are often seen as a healthy stage before renewed growth, suggesting that long-term investors continue to build exposure. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Momentum With $17M Raised The MAGACOIN FINANCE presale has quickly become one of the most active campaigns of 2025, collecting over $17 million so far. Its structured approach and deflationary token design appeal to both retail and institutional participants seeking growth exposure.The project’s model integrates staking rewards, automatic burn mechanics, and liquidity controls that limit whale dominance. With a capped supply of 170 billion tokens, the system introduces scarcity and long-term value stability. Each transaction burns a small portion of tokens, steadily reducing supply as network activity grows. The roadmap outlines a final presale phase by Q4 2025, followed by exchange listings in early 2026. Analysts forecast that MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver returns of 100x once listings begin if current momentum continues. Early participants view it as a rare sub-$0.01 opportunity, offering undervalued exposure before major exchanges open trading.This has led traders to describe it as one of the best crypto to buy during the ongoing market correction. Its rapid community expansion across X and Telegram further supports investor confidence.Smaller traders who missed early Dogecoin or Shiba Inu runs are now eyeing MAGACOIN FINANCE as a possible next-cycle contender. Analysts note that the project combines meme-style engagement with real-world DeFi utility, a balance few new tokens achieve. Conclusion Ethereum’s technical structure remains in a recovery phase as buyers defend the $3,600–$3,800 zone. With large investors preparing a $1 billion Ethereum treasury, broader sentiment is slowly turning positive again. At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to gather momentum, with over $17 million raised and growing demand from early participants. Its deflationary system, transparent presale stages, and community support position it among the best crypto to buy heading into 2026.

According to prominent market analyst Burak Kesmeci, several on-chain developments unfolded during this price decline that are now indicative of the present market and potential price movements. Related Reading: Bitcoin LTH Inflow On Binance Surges Tenfold Within Days — What This Could Mean Bitcoin Metrics Flash Extreme Fear, But Local Bottom May Be Near In an X post on October 18, Kesmeci reports that Bitcoin’s on-chain landscape has flashed a series of key signals that generally suggest heightened fear and potential accumulation opportunities in the market. The analyst shares recent developments from seven important on-chain metrics during Bitcoin’s fall in the third week of October. Firstly, the Fear and Greed Index plunged into the “extreme fear” zone, reflecting a surge in investor anxiety following Bitcoin’s latest price correction. However, Kesmeci states that this is an event typically observed near market lows rather than peaks, and may not be the ideal time for selling. Meanwhile, the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) metric dropped below 50%, moving sentiment from optimism to worry, as the average profitability among holders is being eroded. In the derivatives market, funding rates turned negative, showing that short positions now dominate futures markets. On the equity side, shares of the largest crypto treasury MicroStrategy (MSTR) declined below $300, reflecting broader weakness in Bitcoin-linked assets. However, the firm also reinforced its long-standing conviction by adding 220 BTC to its holdings, bringing its total to 640,251 BTC, and underscoring continued institutional confidence despite short-term pressure. In addition, on-chain valuation indicators also highlighted deep oversold conditions. The Advanced NVT Signal fell below -0.5 standard deviations, a level historically associated with an oversold market and early bottom phases. The Active Address Sentiment Indicator (AASI) shows that Bitcoin’s price has dropped disproportionately relative to network activity, a relationship often followed by recovery periods as fundamentals stabilize ahead of sentiment. When all considered together, these signals suggest that Bitcoin is operating within an extreme fear and oversold environment. However, Kesmeci also hints that the local market bottom may be forming, suggesting that the present market condition presents strong accumulation opportunities. Bitcoin Price Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $106,970 after a 0.29% decline in the last 24 hours. The monthly chart reflects an 8.32% loss as the premier cryptocurrency struggles to establish its expected “Uptober” bullish form. However, Coincodex analysts are predicting an imminent market rebound, with a projected price target of $124,172 in five days.

The recent movement in XRP’s price has done exactly that. The asset briefly fell to $1.53 in a flash crash , marking its lowest point in 2025. Although its recovery was quick, it has not fully recovered, leaving many investors worried. The digital asset currently trades at $2.32, down 1.16% from yesterday. This short-term volatility has left many market participants asking why prices have weakened despite a steady stream of positive developments . “if there’s so much good news, why is price dropping?” one of the most common questions i’m getting right now. so what’s happening? whenever there’s significant market uncertainty (ie trade war, tariffs, geo-political tension etc), investors sell risk assets (ie crypto,… — Dom | EasyA (@dom_kwok) October 17, 2025 A Positive Perspective on XRP Dom Kwok, co-founder of EasyA, addressed this concern directly in a recent post on X, responding to the question about why XRP’s price is dropping despite the positive news, as one of the most common questions he has received. Kwok provided a clear framework for understanding the recent market behavior and reflected continued optimism about XRP’s position within the crypto economy. He pointed out that times of uncertainty, whether driven by trade disputes, tariffs, or geopolitical tension, tend to trigger predictable investor behavior. Under such conditions, he said, investors “sell risk assets”, such as crypto and growth stocks, shifting toward safer holdings, including cash and gold. According to him, this approach is not unique to XRP but part of a wider trend across financial markets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The co-founder emphasized that the movement toward safety is temporary and largely psychological, as investors often “wait it out until it’s safe to take more risk again.” This perspective aligns with recent market data showing record highs for gold, a traditional haven, while digital assets and equities have seen short-term declines. For Kwok, these patterns are normal rather than alarming, suggesting the current downturn in XRP’s price does not reflect its long-term value or utility. Long-Term Outlook for XRP While some traders focus on immediate price swings, Kwok encouraged investors to take a longer view. He asked two key questions: whether they believe in crypto’s promise and whether they see improvements in fundamentals and regulation. He noted that if the answer to both is yes, “then this is a great buying opportunity .” He believes the present correction is a healthy pause within a larger growth trajectory for the digital asset sector. While XRP’s recent decline was notable, it comes amid growing institutional attention and ongoing progress in regulatory clarity across several jurisdictions.

According to the agency, the Friday operation caused a dent in a platform that operated a SIM farm and enabled its sets to carry out diverse crimes ranging from phishing scams to investment fraud. In a statement by the agency, the operation, dubbed Operation SIMCARTEL, saw 26 strategic searches carried out in a coordinated law enforcement effort. Europol mentioned that the operation resulted in the arrest of seven suspects and the seizure of 1,200 SIM box devices, which contained more than 40,000 active SIM cards. Five of the detained suspects were Latvian internationals. The Latvian police mentioned in an announcement that the platform was related to anonymous communication and payments, impacting more than 3,200 people in different countries. Europol apprehends suspects in CaaS platform disruption Europol also claimed that it dismantled five servers tied to the operation, taking over two websites, gogetsms[.]com and apisim[.]com, that were used to advertise the services. The websites have since been branded with a banner stating that it has been seized by authorities. In addition, four luxury vehicles were confiscated, with €431,000 ($502,000) in suspects’ bank accounts and €266,000 ($310,000) in their cryptocurrency accounts frozen by Europol . The operation consisted of law enforcement from countries like Austria, Latvia, Finland, and Estonia, in collaboration with Europol and Eurojust. In its statement, Europol said the criminal network was responsible for more than 1,700 individual cyber fraud cases in Austria and 1,500 cases in Latvia. The agency also claimed that victims have lost a cumulative €4.5 million ($5.25 million) and €420,000 ($489,000) in the two countries, respectively, due to their services and operations. “The criminal network and its infrastructure were technically highly sophisticated and enabled perpetrators around the world to use this SIM-box service to conduct a wide range of telecommunications-related cybercrimes, as well as other crimes,” the agency said. The network offered telephone numbers registered to people from over 80 countries for use in criminal activities, including setting up fake social media accounts on different platforms to obscure the location and original identity of the user. Law enforcement details the scale of the operation In total, Europol claimed that the service enabled the creation of more than 49 million accounts online. These accounts are then used to carry out wide-scale phishing campaigns or to trick victims into investing in fake or bogus trading schemes. Another type of scam involved contacting people and posing as their relatives. They claim that they now have a new number and ask them to transfer funds, which are always in four digits, to a new number to quickly sort out an emergency. Some of the offenses that the platform facilitated included extortion , migrant smuggling, and the distribution of child sexual abuse materials. According to snapshots from the Internet Archive, GoGetSMS was dubbed as a platform where people could get “fast and secure temporary phone numbers.” The platform promised potential customers up to 10 million numbers to choose from and noted that they could receive verification from over 160 online servers. On its website, GoGetSMS also provides users with the ability to monetize existing SIM cards by turning them into powerful assets to generate passive income using specialized software. This way, users earn revenue for every SMS message that is sent to them. Users have also complained that they have been scammed by the platform. “Tried multiple times, wasted both time and money. Support is completely unresponsive – no help, no refund, nothing,” a user said on Trustpilot.

The company announced that from now on, any accounts found to be violating the Exchange, Binance Wallet or Binance Alpha platform rules or using automated tools (such as bot farms) will be permanently banned from all exchange activities and any profits from Alpha campaigns will be revoked. Users have speculated that these bans are focused specifically on the ChainOpera (COAI) token. Binance, however, did not directly name a specific token but maintained that it has a “zero tolerance policy against abuse of the Alpha platform.” Related News: Altcoin Price Plummets, Developers Announce Buyback to Cover Losses The official statement made by the Stock Exchange included the following statements: To protect our users and ensure a fair platform, we banned over 600 accounts last week that were abusing Binance Alpha and conducting fraudulent trades using automated tools.

Confirmed violations will result in accounts being permanently banned from all exchange campaigns, and airdrops and similar earnings will be revoked. The exchange also announced a new rewards system to boost community engagement. This means the first user to report a verified breach will receive a reward of up to 50% of the recovered earnings. *This is not investment advice.

The data, obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request by accounting firm UHY Hacker Young, shows a 134% increase in warning notices. These letters are typically sent before formal investigations begin, urging recipients to review their filings and settle outstanding liabilities. UK and India Tax Authorities Tap Exchange Data to Track Crypto Evaders UHY partner Neela Chauhan said HMRC is leveraging data provided directly by crypto exchanges to identify potential cases of tax avoidance. The UK’s campaign mirrors global efforts. In India, tax authorities are reportedly pursuing over 400 suspected crypto tax evaders using data shared by Binance. Both examples highlight how governments are gaining deeper visibility into crypto activity through international data-sharing agreements. Starting January 2026, HMRC will gain even broader access to information through the Crypto-Assets Reporting Framework (CARF), a global initiative adopted by around 70 jurisdictions, including OECD members. Under CARF, exchanges will be required to report user and transaction data to national tax authorities, with the first submissions due by May 31, 2027. The UK’s tax rules classify most crypto assets as investments. Any sale, swap, or purchase made with crypto counts as a disposal subject to Capital Gains Tax (CGT). Top 0.1% earners in the UK already pay more income taxes than the bottom 50%. Why should they pay even more? At some point such unfair treatment simply makes the most successful people emigrate and take countless jobs with them. Why is it so difficult to understand? pic.twitter.com/ss76cXIxHN — Michael A. Arouet (@MichaelAArouet) October 19, 2025 Earning crypto through mining, staking, airdrops, or employment is treated as income, taxed separately. Recent adjustments raised CGT rates to 18% for basic-rate and 24% for higher-rate taxpayers for disposals made after October 30, 2024. Meanwhile, the UK’s financial regulator has lifted its four-year ban on crypto-based exchange-traded notes (ETNs), allowing asset managers to list products on the London Stock Exchange. Market analysts at IG Group expect the move to boost domestic crypto activity by as much as 20%, reflecting growing mainstream acceptance despite heightened tax enforcement. UK to Appoint ‘Digital Markets Champion’ to Oversee Blockchain Transition in Finance As reported, the UK government plans to appoint a “digital markets champion” to accelerate the nation’s shift toward blockchain-based financial infrastructure, according to remarks by Economic Secretary to the Treasury Lucy Rigby. The new official will coordinate private sector efforts on tokenizing wholesale financial instruments and ensure that innovation aligns with the country’s regulatory framework. Speaking at the Digital Assets Week conference in London, Rigby also announced the creation of the Dematerialisation Market Action Taskforce, a new body focused on replacing paper-based share certificates with digital records to enhance market efficiency. The initiative is part of the UK’s Wholesale Financial Markets Digital Strategy, which outlines plans for issuing blockchain-based sovereign debt known as “digital gilts” under the DIGIT framework.

The market sentiment indicator registered “extreme fear” with a rating of 23 on Saturday and has climbed to 29 on Sunday, but remains deep in “fear” territory. Market sentiment has not been this bad since the April crash, which was caused by US President Donald Trump’s tariff announcement. Back then, around $500 billion was wiped off the total market capitalization, and Bitcoin tanked to $76,000. October has been worse, with $900 billion exiting markets in a record leverage flush last weekend. Bitcoin also deepened its correction, dumping 17% from its all-time high on Oct. 6.

Extreme Fear Current price: $107,277 pic.twitter.com/fYKCcqw3ah — Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index (@BitcoinFear) October 18, 2025 Don’t Panic Yet Markets have yet to recover from last week’s crash , and total cap remains at a three-month low of $3.72 trillion. Nevertheless, most experienced analysts and traders remain unconcerned, having witnessed these types of bull market corrections numerous times before. Bitcoin has been in an “incredibly steady and solid up trend this cycle,” said ‘Daan Crypto Trades.’ “Even with this recent decline, there’s no big change in market structure yet. But we are at a critical area,” he added . “For me, a move back below $100K would mean this is due for a larger and longer correction. At that point, there will be many doubts about whether the cycle is done or not.” BTC needs to “rise from the ashes of last week’s events” to get momentum going again, he said. Analyst ‘Sykodelic’ said markets are still in an uptrend, observing that every decline has hit the 50-week simple moving average, and bounced back as it did last week. “There has been mass fear in the market, with the majority panic selling and everyone saying it is over,” they observed. Meanwhile, analyst ‘Crypto₿irb’ noted that extreme fear has struck for the fourth time this cycle as ETFs were rushing to sell, and October is deep in the red. “In short, pressure builds at the bottom. BTC trades near $107K, fear peaking, volatility rising. ETF liquidity still strong, miners steady The market’s coiling up for an even larger wave. When fear peaks, volatility wins.” Is bull run over? Extreme fear strikes for the 4th time this cycle. ETFs rushing to sell big, and October is deep in red. Is $90k next? Here’s my extremely honest take.

Crypto Market Outlook There has been little change in crypto markets over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin has been trading in a very tight range between $106,000 and $107,000 and has failed to break support turned resistance at $108,000. Ethereum spiked above $3,900 on Saturday but couldn’t hold it and fell back to the $3,850 level, also failing to break resistance above $4,000. The altcoins remained battered and bruised with very little movement in either direction this weekend.

His message has echoed through the crypto community as his own legal fight moves forward. Reports have disclosed a mixed jury outcome in Manhattan and a high-stakes debate over whether publishing code can amount to running a money-transmitting business. Storm asked DeFi developers: “How can you be so sure you will not be charged by the Justice department as a money service business for building a non-custodial protocol?” Developers Warned Of Retroactive Risk According to court filings and public statements, Storm argued that US law gives little protection to people who publish software that others use to move funds. Based on reports, prosecutors called Tornado Cash a system that had been used to launder more than $1 billion. Just a question for current DeFi devs: How can you be so sure you won’t be charged by the DOJ as an MSB – for building a non-custodial protocol – and then accused you should’ve built it custodial instead? If SDNY can charge a dev for building a non-custodial protocol…who’s… — Roman Storm (@rstormsf) October 18, 2025 Storm’s team pushed back, saying the protocol was non-custodial — the software does not hold user funds — and that blaming builders for users’ crimes would chill honest open-source work. Tornado: A Jury Split Over Charges In Manhattan The jury could not reach agreement on other, more serious counts. The US Attorney’s Office had described broad illicit use of the tool, while the defense has focused on the technical facts: no single person controlled the protocol in the way a bank controls accounts. Defense lawyers have filed motions seeking acquittal and asked judges to weigh whether code creators can be punished for how third parties use their work. Legal Community Raises Alarm Based on reports, lawyers and commentators, including noted crypto legal experts, warn that the case could set a wide precedent if prosecutors’ theory holds. Some in the community have organized fundraising to help with the Tornado Cash founder’s legal costs. Others say the matter touches free speech, since publishing code can be a form of expression, and holding authors criminally liable would change how many people write and share software. Defense Moves And Technical Arguments Storm’s team points to decentralization and noncustodial design. They argue that the protocol’s code runs on public blockchains and that no person was operating a service that took custody of funds in the ordinary sense. Recent court filings press these themes and ask the judge to overturn the guilty verdict. Prosecutors counter that when tools are built and promoted in ways that foresee illicit use, legal responsibility can follow.

Investors Hedge With RTX,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/how-likely-is-a-drop-to-90k-investors-hedge-with-rtx/,"The latest bitcoin price prediction is tinged with nervousness. With Bitcoin currently trading around $107,000, several analysts are warning that a retest of $90,000 is more than just a remote possibility, it could be imminent. Yet even as traders brace for potential volatility forecasted by Bitcoin price prediction models, a growing number of investors are diversifying into high-upside altcoins like Remittix , a project many see as a hedge against Bitcoin’s next major move. Analysts are describing Remittix as the “next 100x crypto” ready for takeoff as soon as major liquidity rotates away from Bitcoin. Here’s all you need to know. Bitcoin Price Predictions: Assessing Bitcoin’s Q4 $90,000 Threat A breakdown below key support zones is setting the stage for a bloody October according to pessimistic Bitcoin price prediction models. Most analysts say if Bitcoin breaches $102,000, it could quickly fall toward the mid-$90,000 range, with $90,000 as a psychologically loaded level where institutional demand is clustered. Conversely, Bitcoin fundamentals show that the largest cryptocurrency in the world is not in the process of losing its fire. On the contrary, it is gaining strong momentum silently and the recent BTC price move is part of a much needed correction. In a show of just how much the big players believe in Bitcoin, El Salvador recently declared the opening of its own Bitcoin Bank, which is another significant step towards international adoption of BTC and top Bitcoin price prediction models expect this move will open new financial opportunities to both the citizens and foreign investors. BTC-based lending, savings, and payments is expected to become easier and more accessible through the Bitcoin Bank and will turn El Salvador into a center of digital finance in Latin America. Although the price action of Bitcoin has been volatile in the short term, long-term supporters are citing occurrences such as this as evidence that BTC has not lost its utilization around the world and the trust of its institutions. That is to say, the fundamentals are more than ever, and Bitcoin may be about to have an even greater breakout, which could be brewing under the surface. The Other Play: Why Investors Are Eyeing RTX While Bitcoin is facing tail-risk, attention is shifting fast toward Remittix (RTX), a high-growth DeFi project that’s being dubbed by many as the best crypto to buy now. This isn’t just hype—the project is gathering heavy momentum, with thousands of early holders already locked in. The pull isn’t coincidence, it’s strategic. As BTC risk rises, smart money is pre-positioning in what’s being called the next big altcoin in 2025, something that might capture the upside if Bitcoin sputters. And indeed, early investors are already talking about 2× to 3× gains even before mainstream attention kicks in. Why Remittix Is Burning Up Screens Global Reach: crypto to bank transfers in 30+ countries Real-World Utility: payment rails built in from day one Strong Capital: tens of millions raised, large holder base Exchange Ready: confirmed listing path via leading centralized exchanges It’s rare to see a project with utility, infrastructure, and urgency all in one. That’s exactly what people mean when they talk about buying RTX tokens now while you still can. Remittix Giveaway And Referral Is Creating Passive Income Remittix has launched a $250,000 giveaway and its new referral program has participants earning 15% in USDT of new buyer purchases, claimable daily. This marketing mechanic has super-charged its network effect. With over 350,000 entries and more than 40,000 early holders now onboard, the project’s community growth has gone viral. But here’s the key: once the wallet transitions from beta to full launch and major CEX listings go live, the window for early access closes. The Bitcoin market may wobble and when it does, smart money will already be in RTX. Don’t be left out.

The token climbed to $3.37 before pulling back, and according to technical analyst JD (@jaydee_757), this movement was an anticipated outcome. He noted that profits were taken near that level after accumulation at $0.28, describing it as a strong 12x return. The attached chart presents a long-term view of XRP’s price on the monthly timeframe, with key resistance and support trendlines drawn. It highlights a crucial support area that JD expects to hold once the monthly candle closes. His analysis emphasizes the importance of this trendline, warning that failure to maintain it could trigger a decline. $XRP – Glad we, or ""some"" took 30% profits below $3.37 (green box) after buying at 0.28! EASY 12x! This will be the trendline to hold after month close! I called 0.28 bottom, $3.37 local top, $1.60 crash.. I'm calling MARKET TOP next using TA! 500 RTs for my next target!… pic.twitter.com/E49RB5EKc1 — JD (@jaydee_757) October 17, 2025 Tracking the Historical Pattern JD’s post revisits a familiar narrative among XRP investors of steep corrections following major price rallies. His chart shows that a similar setup in 2018 led to a retracement of around 95% , erasing most of the prior gains. The image contains annotations referencing that decline and the long consolidation period that followed, suggesting that past holders endured an extended recovery phase lasting several years. The chart further highlights a gradual uptrend that began after XRP’s prolonged consolidation. JD identifies the $0.28 level as a historical bottom and $3.37 as a recent local top, aligning with his earlier projections of the $1.6 correction that followed. He indicates that his next forecast will focus on identifying the market’s eventual top based on technical analysis. Examining the Technical Setup The central element of JD’s analysis is the white horizontal support line intersecting a long-term rising trendline. This structure, combined with the exponential moving average (EMA) line around $1.84, defines the region he views as essential for XRP’s continued upward structure. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 If XRP maintains a monthly close above this level, the trend could remain intact. A breakdown, however, would signal a structural shift that might resemble the historical retracement illustrated in the pink projection zone. The chart annotations reinforce the significance of the upcoming monthly close. By referencing historical price movements , JD draws attention to XRP’s cyclical behavior, where deep corrections have historically followed rapid expansions. Investor Sentiment Ahead of the Close XRP traded around $2.27 at the time of his analysis, and the market faces a pivotal test. JD’s historical context and level mapping offer a technical framework that appeals to experienced traders monitoring long-term patterns. While he does not explicitly predict immediate continuation or collapse, the analysis implies that the next monthly close could determine whether XRP sustains its multi-year uptrend or enters another prolonged corrective phase.

Bitcoin and Dogecoin, two of the most closely watched coins, are having trouble maintaining momentum after another wave of selling pressure. While panic is spreading throughout the market, smart money investors seem to be using the weakness to accumulate. Besides the market leaders, more attention is turning towards MAGACOIN FINANCE , a project that is drawing interest with its utility-based design and with a long-term growth plan. Bitcoin Price Slumps Toward $105K as Buyers Defend Support Bitcoin is trading at about $107,000 after holding the $105,000 support level. Buyers have responded rapidly to this zone, creating a firm rebound base. The daily chart reveals multiple bounces from this area, indicating ongoing accumulation in the face of general market fear. Source: X Technical indicators are starting to turn upwards. The RSI has recovered from oversold levels, which implies fading downside momentum. If Bitcoin stays above $105,000, analysts see potential for a run to $115,000 before $125,000 and potentially to $135,000. However, a break below $105,000 would weaken this bullish setup, exposing BTC to a retest of $100,000 before a recovery. For now, price structure and improving volume provide indications of renewed confidence as quiet accumulation builds at lower levels. Dogecoin Struggles to Recover After Heavy Whale Selling In the last 24 hours, Dogecoin (DOGE) slipped another 10% to trade near $0.17, raising its weekly loss to more than 27%. On-chain data indicates whales unloading about 360 million DOGE, valued at around $74 million, during the decline. Source: TradingView The drop came even as developers announced new partnerships, including the House of Doge–Nasdaq merger plan and Thumzup’s DOGE payout program. However, traders have looked at both as early-stage concepts rather than immediate catalysts. Profit-taking quickly took over relatively thin liquidity, sending DOGE into key support between $0.17-$0.19. Holding that band could see a rebound to $0.21 – $0.23, where major moving averages are clustered. A close above $0.23 would break the descending structure, but failure to defend $0.17 risks another slide to $0.15. Market momentum is also mixed, with RSI hovering around 45 and derivatives pointing towards neutral funding, reflecting hesitation from short-term traders. MAGACOIN FINANCE Presale Gains Momentum While leading coins consolidate, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a standout story in the current market. Unlike many presale tokens that fade after listings, MAGACOIN’s model emphasizes real utility and long-term scalability . Its roadmap focuses on practical ecosystem integration, positioning it for sustainable adoption rather than speculative hype. Upcoming exchange listings have fueled excitement, with analysts projecting potential 75x gains for early buyers. The project’s steady growth and expanding holder base reflect rising institutional confidence even as broader sentiment remains cautious. Investors describe MAGACOIN FINANCE as a token that is thriving during fear rather than collapsing under it . MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly viewed as a smart-money alternative for those seeking exposure to the next major rotation in altcoins. Analysts See Calm Ahead as Accumulation Broadens Market strategists believe that for Bitcoin and Dogecoin, there is a likelihood that these will soon stabilize if buying pressure is sustained near the current ranges. Sustained whale participation, combined with slowing down retail liquidation, supports the notion that the market is headed towards a late stage of correction. This calm, some analysts suggest, is how early-stage plays such as MAGACOIN FINANCE like to perform, capitalizing on the dual benefit of a growing community demand and the inevitable rotation that comes back into the broader crypto market. Conclusion Bitcoin and Dogecoin remain under pressure as market fear intensifies, yet large investors continue to buy through the volatility. Each pullback has revealed quiet accumulation, hinting that sentiment could soon reverse. At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE is proving that strong fundamentals still matter in crypto. Its focus on utility and transparent expansion has turned it into one of the few presale tokens attracting both retail and whale attention. For investors watching fear dominate headlines, this may be the moment when opportunity begins quietly to form.

The company’s massive AI city vision rests on a vision that is very nearly impossible pull off: designing and producing billions of custom chips in partnership with Broadcom to support what CEO Sam Altman calls the “computing spine” of the future. Sam told the Wall Street Journal that delivering the artificial-intelligence services people demand will require at least one AI-specific chip per user, a mind-bending projection that runs into the billions. Ali Farhadi, head of the Allen Institute for AI, backed that scale, saying if AI replaces human labor at the rate promised, “the world will need as many AI chips as it has conventional ones.” For OpenAI , this is about control; over costs, over power consumption, and over the long-term survival of its models as demand explodes. OpenAI links Broadcom, Nvidia, and memory giants for next-gen compute Nvidia of course still dominates the AI training space, with roughly 70% market share, which is why OpenAI has to continue using its GPUs for model training. But OpenAI is now splitting the pipeline: training happens on Nvidia, inference (the process of delivering answers to users) moves to Broadcom’s custom silicon. This two-track design could cut expenses and power usage at a scale where every percentage point matters. Jordan Nanos, a semiconductor researcher at SemiAnalysis, said Broadcom is helping OpenAI “remix the typical AI-chip recipe.” These chips won’t be generic. They’re being engineered specifically for OpenAI’s models, which rely on high-bandwidth memory, supplied by Samsung and SK Hynix, two firms the company recently partnered with. That type of memory allows faster data movement between processors, critical for systems like OpenAI’s Pulse, an AI agent that scans the web daily to brief users. Pulse consumes so much computing power that Sam said it’s limited to those who pay $200 a month for the Pro tier. This dependency on high-bandwidth memory ties directly to how OpenAI’s models operate. Early neural networks were “dense,” activating large sections of their systems for every query. Newer ones use “sparsity”, which activates only specific expert sections. Instead of using 25% of the model to answer a question, modern systems trigger a fraction of a percent. That difference slashes power draw and speeds up response times. When a chip is built around that sparse logic, efficiency skyrockets, and Broadcom is the one making that hardware possible. OpenAI’s gigawatt-scale AI supercomputers redefine infrastructure Sam has said that OpenAI’s current compute footprint is around 2 gigawatts, spread across global data centers. The Broadcom partnership aims to build up to 10 gigawatts by 2030, forming the physical base for what insiders are calling AI cities, dense campuses of servers, storage, and custom interconnects tied together by Broadcom’s Tomahawk Ultra networking chips. That’s only part of the wave. Over the past three weeks, OpenAI has added 16 gigawatts in fresh capacity deals with AMD and Nvidia, bringing the total to levels that could require nearly $1 trillion in investment. xAI’s Memphis Colossus already reached 1.21 gigawatts this fall. Meta’s Hyperion facility in Louisiana is approved for 2.3 gigawatts, with Mark Zuckerberg targeting 5 gigawatts. The AI energy race is officially global. Sam described this transformation as “the biggest joint industrial project in history,” saying even these deals are “a drop in the bucket compared to where we need to go.” Part of his goal is to diversify suppliers. The Stargate campus in Abilene, Texas, being built by Oracle, will focus on AI training, mostly on Nvidia chips. AMD hardware will handle inference workloads, while Broadcom’s custom silicon fills the efficiency gap. As Nanos put it, “OpenAI is looking quite far into the future, and trying to make sure they have access to enough supply of chips.” Get seen where it counts.

In 2027, the price range is expected to be between $59.93 and $71.39, with an average price of $61.59. In 2031, the range is expected to be between $267.69 and $326.17, with an average price of $277.23. AVAX exhibited wild price swings this year. This record came as the crypto market valuation peaked. It later reversed, shedding some of the profits later in the year. While the Avalanche ecosystem has been making strides, the AVAX price has left investors particularly questioning its trajectory. Will AVAX go up? Is AVAX a good investment? Let’s explore these and more in our Cryptopolitan price prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Avalanche Symbol AVAX Current price $20.35 Market cap $8.68B Trading volume $360.83M Circulating supply 426.46M All-time high $146.22 on Nov 21, 2021 All-time low $2.79 on Dec 31, 2020 24-hour high $20.59 24-hour low $19.77 Avalanche price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 15.32% (Very high) 50-day SMA $27.58 200-day SMA $22.87 Sentiment Bearish Green days 13/30 (43%) Fear and Greed Index 29 (Fear) Avalanche price analysis As of October 19, AVAX’s price dropped by 1.94% in 24 hours, underperforming the broader crypto market (-0.83%) and aligning with the broader altcoin momentum. Its trading volume dropped (55.17%), showing less trader conviction in the market trend. AVAX/USD 1-day chart analysis AVAXUSD chart by TradingView Last month, AVAX attempted a recovery, which saw it rise from a low of $24.31 to a high of $36.16. It faced strong resistance at its 30-day macro supply zone ($34.00-$39.38), which resulted in its drop this month. The coin is now reversing from the high with a bearish-neutral Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 36.72. The William Alligator trendlines show that its volatility is rising. The histograms (-1.08) show waning negative momentum. AVAX/USD 4-hour chart analysis AVAXUSD chart by TradingView The 4-hour chart highlights AVAX’s run after breaking below all the major moving average indicators. It now trades at the $20.28 mark, with short candles indicating an indecisive market. The RSI indicator (43.00) shows it trades in neutral territory. Avalanche technical analysis: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 21.32 SELL SMA 5 21.81 SELL SMA 10 22.84 SELL SMA 21 26.42 SELL SMA 50 27.58 SELL SMA 100 25.63 SELL SMA 200 22.87 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 26.10 SELL EMA 5 26.57 SELL EMA 10 26.18 SELL EMA 21 25.33 SELL EMA 50 24.06 SELL EMA 100 23.14 SELL EMA 200 23.69 SELL What to expect from the AVAX price analysis next? Technical analysis suggests that Avalanche is bearish, but neutral on the shorter timeframes. The MACD histograms indicate that its momentum is dropping. Recent news Filecoin Foundation and Avalanche have partnered to launch a new cross-chain data bridge. The bridge will allow developers to build on Avalanche’s C-Chain to store data on Filecoin’s decentralized network. Why is AVAX down? AVAX’s decline reflects profit-taking after a macro rally, technical resistance, and cooling altcoin demand. Will AVAX reach $50? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, AVAX crossed the $50 mark in 2027. Will AVAX reach $100? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, AVAX will reach $100 in 2028, with a maximum price of $106.00 for the year. Can Avalanche reach $1,000? It remains highly unlikely that AVAX will cross the $1,000 mark before 2031. At that market capitalization, it could be more valuable than Ethereum. Can Avalanche reach $10,000? It remains highly unlikely that AVAX will cross the $10,000 mark before 2031. How much will Avalanche be worth in 2025?

Avalanche historic price sentiment Avalanche price history by CoinGecko In July 2020, Avalanche completed its public sale, raising $42 million in less than $4.5 hours. The tokens were distributed after the mainnet launch in September. On Dec 31, 2020, it fell to an all-time low of $2.788. In September 2021, the Ava Labs Foundation received a $230 million investment from Polychain and Three Arrows Capital Group by purchasing the AVAX cryptocurrency. In November 2021, following an agreement with Deloitte to improve US disaster relief funding, AVAX moved to the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. At that time, AVAX moved to its all-time high at $146.22. In Aug 2022, a whistleblower, ‘crypto leaks’, published a report accusing Ava Labs of secret deals with a law firm to destabilize its competitors. Ava Labs CEO Emin Gün Sirer denied any involvement in a shady deal with the Roche Freedman law firm. In 2023, AVAX maintained a bullish trend from January to May, after which bears took control of the market. It resumed the positive momentum in October, rising to $49.96 In 2024, it crossed the $60 mark in March. The rise coincided with a record high in AVAX inscriptions, with over 100 million ASC-20 minted since their introduction in June 2023. The uptrend reversed in April 2024; by July, it had fallen to $24.40. In August, it was at $21, and in September and October, it was at $27. It turned bullish in November 2024, rising from as low as $23 to as high as $55 in December. It later corrected and traded at $42 into 2025. The drop continued into January; by June, it had fallen below $20. In July, it traded at the $18 level and $23 in September. In October, it rose above $30.",Crypto Price Predictions|avax,EN,0,0,AVAX|TRADING|MARKET|ICO|BLOCKCHAIN|TECHNOLOGY|FIL|REGULATION|BTC|BUSINESS|APT|CRYPTOCURRENCY|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-19 12:44:00

The drop came after Bitcoin skimmed record highs and then tumbled in a fast, wide sell-off that hit many traders and funds. Related Reading: Michael Saylor Issues Rally Cry To Bitcoin Army: “Starve The Bears!” Satoshi’s Holdings And Recent Value Change According to on-chain tracking and Arkham-linked estimates, the set of addresses attributed to Satoshi contains about 1.096 million BTC. That pile of coins reached a peak valuation above $136 billion when Bitcoin traded at just over $126,000 in early October. Reports have disclosed that the same stash is now roughly $20 billion smaller in headline value than at those highs. Market data show how the math works: a swing of several thousand dollars per coin becomes tens of billions of dollars against a million-plus BTC balance. The loss is unrealized — the addresses tied to the creator were not reported to have moved — but the headline number grabbed attention because it highlights how volatile valuations can be for the largest holders. What Triggered The Sell-Off Based on reports from market analysts and mainstream outlets, the crash was set off by a mix of political shocks and exchange-level stress. US President Donald Trump’s tariff announcement and related trade threats shook risk markets, and at the same time a rare pricing glitch and thin liquidity on some venues amplified selling pressure. The resulting cascade forced automatic liquidations of large margin positions, which analytics firms put at roughly $19 billion over a short span. Bitcoin’s price briefly fell into the low $104,000s during the worst of the rout on Friday before partial recoveries arrived the next days. That sharp move wiped out gains that had accumulated over recent months and created a rapid re-ranking of the richest-by-paper-wealth lists. Trading desks said the event exposed weaknesses in market plumbing. Orders that would have been absorbed in calmer conditions instead interacted with each other in thin markets, causing price gaps across exchanges. Many traders who had used borrowed capital to amplify bets were forced to exit, which made the slide steeper and quicker. Related Reading: Bitcoin Plunges To $105k As Investors Shift To Gold After Crypto Carnage Market Significance And What To Watch Next Analysts caution that a headline loss for Satoshi Nakamoto is mainly a measure of how much value moved on paper; it is not cash that changed hands from the founder. Still, the episode matters because it removed a layer of speculative excess and tested whether major supports hold as flows settle.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/game-designer-ripple-is-the-invisible-hand-xrp-is-the-virtual-oil-heres-why/,"A recent post by game designer and crypto analyst Chad Steingraber outlines a structured view of how institutional treasury systems may already be interfacing with digital liquidity infrastructure beneath standard corporate operations. The shared diagram features GTreasury and BNY Mellon, with reference to RLUSD and an underlying value layer, suggesting a deeper integration between traditional finance platforms and emerging settlement technologies. Ripple is the invisible hand. XRP is the virtual oil. GTreasury—>BNY Mellon (RLUSD Custody) https://t.co/iZoWbGFHSp pic.twitter.com/7KEstnlKCi — Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) October 17, 2025 Corporate Treasury Workflow and System Architecture The image in the post features GTreasury, a leading Treasury and Risk Management System (TRMS) provider recently acquired by Ripple, positioned as the operational platform through which corporations can manage investments and settlement activities. Within this framework, companies initiate trade instructions, wire requests, and transaction confirmations through GTreasury. These actions are then routed toward BNY Mellon, which is depicted as the custodian and settlement agent. External banks remain visible in the process for cash transfers, underpinning the flow of funds when trades are funded or redeemed. Steingraber’s commentary indicates that while the front-end systems appear conventional, there is an additional operational layer managing liquidity and settlement. This is where RLUSD , described as a stable value instrument and a wider liquidity network, comes into focus. RLUSD Custody and Settlement Mechanics According to an interpretation shared in response to the post, when corporations execute cash operations through GTreasury , BNY Mellon assumes the role of custodian for RLUSD in the background. The claim is that settlement occurs using this stable instrument, while a broader infrastructure supports cross-asset liquidity. This interaction is described as functioning without direct visibility to the corporate user, who continues to operate through standard treasury templates and reporting modules. The workflow shown includes messaging pathways for research reports, trade confirmations, and transaction histories, implying that the integration is designed to maintain compatibility with existing reporting standards while benefiting from faster settlement capabilities. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Integration of Liquidity Networks The post further suggests that a distinct liquidity network underpins the movement of funds across institutions. While not explicitly detailed in the graphic, the commentary aligns this liquidity layer with real-time value transfer, operating behind conventional banking rails. The suggestion is that digital infrastructure is not presented to the user but facilitates the instantaneous movement of institutional funds. This layout positions each component—GTreasury for instruction, BNY Mellon for custody, external banks for cash settlement, and digital liquidity rails for execution—as part of a unified operational stack. Institutional Adoption Dynamics Steingraber’s overview reflects an argument that corporate finance systems are gradually aligning with digital assets and tokenized liquidity without requiring enterprises to alter their existing tools. By embedding stable instruments such as RLUSD into custody and settlement processes, institutions could enable real-time liquidity while preserving traditional treasury workflows. This model, as presented, reinforces the premise that digital settlement architecture is advancing within institutional frameworks, functioning alongside legacy infrastructure rather than replacing it.

Many investors are already exploring alternatives, and that opens a window for Remittix (RTX) to gain attention. While XRP faces technical pressure, Remittix offers an alternative built around real-world payments rather than speculative crypto momentum. This shift matters for anyone tracking XRP’s outlook and considering the best crypto to buy option grounded in utility and growth. XRP Faces Technical Pressure The cryptocurrency chart displays XRP developing a death cross on important moving averages. This indicates that sellers remain in control. Analysts remarked that a break below support around $2.00 could see XRP weaken further down toward $1.75. For now, the price prediction for XRP remains cautious, as downside risk is dominating the short-term sentiment. Why Remittix Stands Out As A Utility-Driven Alternative XRP is entering a phase of technical vulnerability and uncertain timing for institutional catalysts. Remittix, by contrast, is positioned as a crypto solving real-world problems, geared toward cross-border payments infrastructure rather than purely settlement or token speculation, and this is why XRP holders are diversifying into it. Remittix has sold over 679 million tokens, its token is priced at $0.1166, and it has raised more than $27.5 million. It has secured CEX listings on Bitmart and LBANK and is preparing a third listing. The team is verified by CertiK, where Remittix is ranked #1 among prelaunch tokens. The beta wallet is live, with community testers engaging. The project offers a 15% USDT referral program claimable every 24 hours, and runs a $250,000 giveaway to expand its user base. As Remittix approaches the $30 million raise milestone, it has reintroduced a 50% bonus (promo code RTX50) ahead of a major CEX reveal. Here are five features strengthening Remittix: Solving a real-world $19 trillion payments problem Direct crypto to bank transfers in 30+ countries Audited by CertiK, built with trust and transparency One of the few projects with product progress before TGE Mass market appeal beyond just the crypto crowd Remittix Offers A Pragmatic Option Amid XRP’s Chart Weakness XRP price prediction currently signals trouble as death cross patterns deepen and support zones weaken. Amid this pressure, Remittix stands out as the next big altcoin in 2025 built around real payments, not pure hype. For investors hedging technical risk in XRP, adding a token like Remittix may diversify exposure from purely speculative price plays to usage-centric models. While XRP may fight its way back, Remittix offers a clearer pathway toward adoption and utility-led growth.

The network has evolved into a central hosting platform for major decentralized projects like Raydium, Pump.fun, and Helium, attracting both developers and investors seeking scalable blockchain solutions. Its ability to process high transaction volumes at a low cost has become one of its defining strengths. Expanding Ecosystem and Developer Growth Source: X The Solana ecosystem generates approximately $425 million in monthly fees, translating to more than $5 billion annually. This strong revenue base demonstrates the network’s growing on-chain activity and adoption. Unlike other blockchains facing congestion and high fees, Solana’s average transaction cost remains around $0.02, making it appealing for both users and developers. Besides its economic performance, Solana’s human capital continues to grow. The network now has more than 1,000 full-time developers, second only to Ethereum. This expanding developer base is fostering rapid innovation, with projects spanning DeFi, consumer apps, and digital infrastructure. Raydium operates as a decentralized exchange on Solana, while Pump.fun has become a key platform for consumer-focused blockchain activity. Helium, another prominent project, utilizes Solana for mobile hotspot networks. Together, these applications illustrate Solana’s versatility and strong developer engagement. Technical Strength and Investor Appeal Solana’s technical design remains one of the fastest among smart contract blockchains. New blocks are produced every 400 milliseconds, and transactions reach finality within 13 seconds. This combination of speed and reliability enhances user experience and supports broader adoption across industries. Consequently, the network’s consistent performance has helped it stand out in an increasingly competitive landscape. From an investment perspective, Solana’s tokenomics present an attractive balance between inflation and yield. The annual supply growth of SOL tokens stands between 4% and 4.5%, while staking rewards average about 7%. Source: X Hence, investors who stake SOL earn real returns between 2.5% and 3%.

With capital shifting across the market, traders now look for the best altcoins to buy heading into Q4 2024. Bitcoin ETFs See Record Withdrawals Bitcoin exchange-traded funds faced $536.4 million in net outflows , the largest daily exit since August. Ark & 21Shares’ ARKB saw the biggest withdrawals at $275 million, while Fidelity’s FBTC followed with $132 million. Other major funds, including those by BlackRock and Grayscale , also reported exits. Analyst Nick Ruck from LVRG Research linked the outflows to rising risk aversion among investors. The trigger came after U.S. President Donald Trump’s 100% tariff announcement on Chinese imports , which led to a $20 billion crypto liquidation wiping out over 1.5 million leveraged traders. Bitcoin dropped 2.36% to $104,360, while Ethereum fell 2.56% to $3,900. Analysts said traders are reducing exposure amid geopolitical uncertainty and tighter liquidity. Despite the pressure, some believe the softening inflation outlook could soon steady the market. The focus now shifts toward altcoins that can rebound faster once capital rotates back into risk assets. Solana Battles to Reclaim Ground Solana (SOL) is under watch as traders eye its struggle to stay above the $175 mark. After dropping below $180, selling pressure grew, but long-term demand still appears intact. Institutional investors continue to accumulate through vehicles like Bitwise’s Solana Staking ETP (BSOL) , which now holds over $100 million in assets. The inflow of regulated capital suggests confidence in Solana’s fundamentals. Despite the current weakness, Solana remains among the best altcoins to buy for Q4 recovery, given its growing institutional footprint and active developer base. Analysts expect any stabilization in Bitcoin to quickly reflect on Solana’s price, especially if accumulation by long-term holders continues . For traders seeking mid-cap growth, SOL remains one of the top altcoins with room to recover once sentiment shifts. Cardano Eyes a Breakout Toward $2 Cardano’s price pattern is turning heads. Analyst Javon Marks pointed to a falling wedge breakout , a setup that has preceded Cardano’s past rallies. ADA’s chart history shows that similar patterns led to multi-month gains after consolidation periods. Currently, ADA trades around $0.83, but Marks forecasts a possible run to $1.20 , followed by a climb toward $2.91 , a four-year high. Blockchain data also shows low crowd sentiment, often a precursor to accumulation phases. Despite its 18% dip from August highs, Cardano still ranks as a top crypto to buy for long-term portfolios . Its consistent development progress and community growth support its recovery case. If capital rotation from Bitcoin intensifies, ADA could see renewed attention in Q4. Sui Faces Volatility but Holds Long-Term Promise Sui (SUI) has had a turbulent October, facing both market pressure and security incidents . The $3.44 million Typus Finance exploit marked its third DeFi breach this year, raising audit concerns. Yet, despite the setbacks, Sui’s ecosystem continues to expand, supported by institutional interest from firms like AMINA Bank, which recently added SUI custody. Trading volume surged 80% during last week’s selloff, showing that liquidity remains deep even as price dropped 11%. Sui’s DEX volume hit $14.3 billion in July , driven by BTCfi integrations and network upgrades that cut transaction finality times. For investors scanning for the best altcoin to buy on dips , Sui’s growing developer base and ecosystem depth make it a promising long-term candidate. Its resilience amid market fear shows that network growth continues despite short-term losses. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Hidden Gem Under $0.0006 Among new altcoins drawing attention for Q4 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a hidden gem . The altcoin trades below $0.0006 , and analysts believe it could climb up to $0.045 , a potential 75x move if capital rotation from Bitcoin spreads into smaller projects. As traders diversify, MAGACOIN FINANCE sits in the sweet spot of low market cap and growing visibility. Its early stage means even a small inflow can drive sharp price moves. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE? Low entry price below $0.0006 New project with small market cap Real breakout potential for Q4 Could catch capital rotation from Bitcoin first Traders are watching this coin closely, and early buyers could benefit most if market recovery sparks a surge into small-cap altcoins. How Traders Can Position for Q4 The record Bitcoin ETF outflows show how quickly market capital shifts. Traders looking for upside in Q4 should focus on recovery altcoins like SOL, ADA, SUI, and MAGACOIN FINANCE —assets showing both liquidity and community interest. As capital rotates away from Bitcoin, early positioning in the right altcoins could make the difference.

According to the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), the APEC CEO Summit will now run from October 28 to 31 — extended by one day from its initial three-day plan. The event is expected to draw leaders from 16 of APEC’s 21 member economies and about 1,700 CEOs. Expected attendees include Nvidia’s Huang, Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman, Google’s Chief Marketing Officer for Asia Pacific Simon Kahn, Citi Group CEO Jane Fraser, and Johnson & Johnson CEO Joaquin Duato. IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva and OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann are also anticipated to attend the summit. Nvidia says Huang will discuss the company’s vision for AI During the four-day summit , business and policy leaders will debate global economic and geopolitical trends, digital transformation, sovereign AI frameworks, digital currencies, and innovations that are shaping the future of mobility. As host, the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry has appointed its chairman, Chey Tae-won, to lead the summit. He will guide sessions from the October 28 opening banquet through the October 31 closing ceremony. Nvidia has confirmed that CEO Jensen Huang, one of the most highly anticipated participants, will attend. He is set to outline Nvidia’s vision for AI, robotics, digital twins, and autonomous driving. Industry insiders suggest he may also hold side meetings with Samsung’s Lee Jae-yong and KCCI’s Chey Tae-won, and perhaps visit some Samsung or SK Hynix chip sites. Huang is slated to deliver his speech on the summit’s final day. Industry leaders from sectors spanning finance to energy will also take the stage, including Citigroup’s Jane Fraser, Johnson & Johnson’s Joaquin Duato, JPMorgan’s Daniel Pinto, Marubeni’s Masayuki Omoto, Hitachi’s Toshiaki Tokunaga, Sinochem’s Li Fanrong, CATL’s Zeng Yuqun, and Deloitte’s David Hill. Global figures such as IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva and OECD head Mathias Cormann, along with Korean tech executives Choi Soo-yeon of Naver and Lee Hong-lak of LG AI Research, will join them. This year’s summit may foster closer relations between the public and private sectors, as companies meet individually with APEC heads of state and ministers to explore concrete business and investment opportunities. So far, economists have estimated that the gathering will add roughly 7.4 trillion won ($5.2 billion) to Korea’s economy and create 22,000 employment opportunities. KCCI Executive Vice Chairman Park Il-jun commented on the summit: “The 2025 APEC CEO Summit will become a practical cooperation platform that turns challenges facing Korean companies into new opportunities.” The Korea Meteorological Administration is partnering with Nvidia Nvidia has been expanding its reach in South Korea. The semiconductor company has been working with the Korea Meteorological Administration to enhance AI-driven weather prediction systems. The companies are collaborating to deploy Cosmos, an AI foundation model created for self-driving and robotics, to boost the accuracy of rainfall predictions. Jeff Adie, a senior engineer at Nvidia, gave his statement on their project: “We aim to ultimately make climate information public so that everyone can access it in the future, with the long-term goal of predicting climate change patterns.” Nvidia-backed startup Cohere also opened up an office in South Korea to serve as an Asia-Pacific hub. The AI company still tailors its large language models to meet the needs of regulated industries, helping clients in finance, healthcare, energy, and government securely automate tasks, including risk assessment and quality monitoring.

According to Kim Yong-beom, Seoul’s chief policy advisor, talks have “moved past most issues,” though a few sticking points still need attention. Kim shared this after returning from Washington, where he held meetings with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and senior economic officials. Both sides, Kim said, now expect “real progress” before their presidents meet on the sidelines of the summit. The sense of optimism follows months of gridlock. President Donald Trump earlier said Washington agreed to cut import tariffs on South Korean goods to 15%, provided Seoul commits to $350 billion in U.S. investments. The announcement, made on July 30, marked a breakthrough in strained negotiations, but auto tariffs remain intact as the two sides continue to argue over how the investment will be structured and delivered. Korea delegation pushes to finalize $350 billion investment deal A South Korean delegation led by Kim Yong-beom, Industry Minister Kim Jung-kwan, Finance Minister Koo Yun-cheol, and Trade Minister Yeo Han-koo arrived in Washington last week to lock down the details of that $350 billion commitment. Seoul insists the amount will mostly come in the form of loans and guarantees, not direct capital transfers, to avoid heavy disruption in the foreign exchange market. Trump, on the other hand, had declared that the payment would be made “upfront.” Kim confirmed both sides were narrowing differences, saying Washington now understands Seoul’s currency concerns. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also told reporters that the countries were “very close” to an agreement and expected an announcement “within 10 days.” Over the weekend, Trump hosted business leaders from Korea, Japan, and Taiwan for a golf outing at Mar-a-Lago, reportedly arranged by SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son. The group included top executives from Samsung, SK, and Hyundai Motor, all of whom have a direct stake in how this trade pact unfolds. Seoul’s biggest concern is about financial stability. A $350 billion outflow, officials warn, equals about 84% of Korea’s foreign exchange reserves. To cushion the impact, Seoul initially requested a dollar-swap deal , which Washington rejected. New funding structure aims to protect Korea’s reserves Economist Hur Jung from Sogang University said the two nations have “reportedly found a way to avoid depleting Korea’s reserves by allowing Seoul to invest using its own currency.” Under the plan, Seoul would issue won-denominated government bonds to raise the $350 billion, then use those proceeds to fund projects in the U.S. Hur, however, warned that such a move, roughly 500 trillion won in one go, could burden taxpayers and push up domestic bond yields. “It’s crucial for Seoul to roll out the investment in stages,” Hur said, stressing that doing it gradually would “minimize liquidity pressure.” But he cautioned that Washington could still push for a deal giving the U.S. a larger share of profits in return for easing currency rules. A report by the Dong-A Ilbo newspaper added that Washington recently floated a new plan to reduce the shock from the massive package. According to a government source, “there are alternative approaches being discussed that would cause less strain on our dollar reserves, such as creating accounts that allow investments in the U.S. using Korean won.” Analysts say this would work like a soft currency swap, without requiring Federal Reserve approval. Seoul could buy U.S. government bonds with won, use those bonds as collateral for dollar loans, and then fund its investment commitments. Other proposals on the table include issuing dollar-denominated Foreign Exchange Stabilization Bonds or creating a special purpose vehicle backed by foreign reserves. Critics warn these options might inflate national debt or erode reserve stability in the long term. Nah Won-jun, an economics professor at Kyungpook National University, said Seoul should consider accepting higher US tariffs instead of transferring massive sums, whether in won or dollars, to America.

The token will play a central role in the company’s transformation from a purely NFT platform into a broader marketplace for digital and tokenized assets. Finzer revealed that in October 2025, OpenSea recorded more than $2.6 billion in trading volume, with 90% coming from token transactions. According to him, this shift marks the beginning of a strategy to turn OpenSea into a platform for “trading everything” — not just NFTs, but also culture, art, ideas, digital goods and even physical assets. “NFTs were chapter one for us. In 2021, OpenSea brought the first wave of everyday internet users onchain. Collectors, artists, gamers, musicians — people who had never opened a wallet — showed up on OpenSea and suddenly owned digital property,” Finzer wrote. SEA will be a core element of that vision. Finzer said the token’s launch was delayed because it “doesn’t deserve to be released and forgotten,” suggesting a long-term strategy rather than a hype drop. Community Rewards and Token Buyback Plan OpenSea plans to distribute up to 50% of the total SEA supply to its community, including active users and rewards program participants. In addition, the marketplace will allocate up to 50% of its revenue during the launch phase to buy back SEA tokens, a move that could support price stability and demand in the early stages. Total issuance details have not yet been revealed. The SEA token was first announced in February 2025, but the official launch is now set for Q1 2026.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MINING|CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-19 13:57:03

These publicly-traded firms, who accumulate digital assets on their balance sheets, offer retail investors who purchase their shares indirect crypto exposure. However, a recent report found that retail investors have lost around $17 billion by investing in Bitcoin treasury stocks. According to the firm, the hype surrounding BTC treasuries seems to be coming to an end, with retail investors forced to deal with the losses. Has The Bitcoin Treasury Bubble Burst? In its market report last week, 10x Research said that the “age of financial magic” is coming to a close for Bitcoin treasury companies. According to the Singapore-based research firm, these treasury companies conjured billions in “paper wealth” by issuing overvalued shares to investors. According to the analytics firm, it made sense for the treasury firms to offer their shares at a premium as the price of Bitcoin continued to increase. 10x Research noted that the once-celebrated premiums to net asset value (NAV) was an illusion that has left investors with losses while “executives walked away with the gold.” 10x Research mentioned that investors who purchased the overvalued stocks during the Bitcoin treasury boom have collectively lost about $17 billion. According to the research firm, the declining volatility and profits is forcing the treasury companies to make a hard pivot from marketing-driven momentum to real market discipline. 10x Research added: The next act won’t be about magic—it will be about who can still generate alpha when the audience stops believing. Unsurprisingly, the performance of Bitcoin-linked stocks has been quite disappointing over the past few months. For example, Strategy’s (previously known as MicroStrategy) MSTR stock has declined by over 20% since August. The Michael Saylor-led firm announced its latest purchase of Bitcoin between October 6 and October 12. The 220 BTC buy—at an average price of $123,561—brought Strategy’s holdings to 640,250 BTC (worth about $47.38 billion). Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $106,799, reflecting no significant movement in the past day. Following the market-wide crash on October 10, the premier cryptocurrency has struggled to sustain any positive momentum. According to data from CoinGecko, the value of Bitcoin has dropped by more than 4% in the last seven days.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Bitcoin treasury companies|BTC news|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-19 14:00:57

He offered a different interpretation of the company’s decision, which many initially viewed as a routine capital allocation. Ripple currently manages a substantial portion of XRP’s total supply through its time-locked escrow system. The new capital deployment, therefore, appears unusual. Instead of expanding development operations or infrastructure, the company has directed funds toward accumulation, a move that some see as an effort to influence available liquidity. They’ll call it a *theory*… until it’s not. Ripple’s $1B $XRP accumulation is the start of something bigger — the Global Reset. Once the switch flips, it won’t be “if,” it’ll be **how high**. $XRP pic.twitter.com/VVQXrKX0rY — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) October 18, 2025 Float Control and Market Supply In his video, Bull Winkle said Ripple’s decision is not about supply but “about float control.” He argued that the company’s actions may be intended to manage circulating liquidity rather than increase reserves. According to him, “a $1 billion buyback” could target “5-8% of XRP’s entire liquid float,” a scale large enough to influence market dynamics. He suggests that Ripple’s accumulation could serve strategic purposes linked to how XRP is positioned within financial corridors. The mention of “float control” implies a coordinated approach to managing supply ahead of rising institutional or payment demand . Such a move could potentially tighten the available market float, setting conditions for a major supply shock . Possible Strategic Alignments Bull Winkle also raised the possibility that Ripple’s acquisitions might extend beyond its internal operations. He noted that “maybe it’s for corridors” or even “for central banks.” His mention of “tokenized treasuries” hinted at preparations for integration with digital financial instruments being developed globally. While Ripple has confirmed none of these, they align with the company’s longstanding focus on cross-border payment infrastructure and tokenized liquidity management . The $1 billion allocation may therefore represent a positioning effort for upcoming institutional or government partnerships that rely on XRP’s on-ledger capabilities.

If Ripple’s purchases succeed in concentrating available XRP within fewer hands, the result could alter the asset’s near-term trading environment and potentially affect its perceived scarcity. Bull Winkle described the development as “the endgame setup,” suggesting that Ripple’s move could kickstart a global financial reset .

(Glassnode),https://cryptopotato.com/how-is-the-options-market-reacting-to-bitcoins-continued-decline-glassnode/,"Within the last seven days, BTC has taken a backseat while gold performed well. The precious metal has taken some share of bitcoin’s status as a store of value, surging by more than 20%. BTC, on the other hand, is down at least 14%, triggering a shift in investor sentiment. Glassnode analysts say the change in market sentiment has been reflected in the options market. Bitcoin’s dip, especially the last overnight decline, came with a wave of macro uncertainty, and investors have been altering their positions to navigate the current environment better. Options Market Reacts to BTC Decline According to Glassnode, the market witnessed a sharp spike in short-dated volatility after bitcoin’s sudden plunge on Thursday night. As a result of that, traders are now paying up for immediate protection, as seen in front-end options trading implied volatility hovering around 50% volume. Options skew is strongly favoring put calls as BTC increasingly behaves like a macro asset. This indicates continued defensive positioning, with downside protection more expensive than upside exposure. The Options Net Premium Strike Heatmap suggests that flows into the market have been fairly balanced. Although some accounts have rolled their protection lower or leveraged the decline to sell volatility, others have picked cheap calls. Glassnode said this reflects a cautious, but not one-sided tone. Investor Sentiment Stays Defensive On a broader scale, the options market paints a defensive picture. Skew is leaning toward puts, wing volumes are bid, and demand is steady for tail hedges. Additionally, demand for downside insurance is dominating. Glassnode explained that many options accounts had year-end upside exposure. However, downside volume now dominates, with the upside momentum having cooled. The analytics firm said traders who can handle the risk will find selling their puts or put spreads to finance possible November upside attractive. However, with the state of the market, only a few will be strong enough to take this path. Meanwhile, CryptoPotato reported earlier that $4.8 billion in options contracts expired this weekend. A little larger than last week’s, this expiry affected more long than short contracts. This mirrors the bearish sentiment that has engulfed the spot market. With the market already deep in negative territory, the multi-billion dollar expiration could trigger more bloodshed or no reaction at all.

Both tokens remain the faces of the meme coin world, but their paths couldn’t be more different. While DOGE leans on its legacy, SHIB is trying to evolve, and this year could determine whether it truly earns the title of “Dogecoin killer.” The latest Shiba Inu price prediction shows a cautious but optimistic outlook, with analysts pointing to steady gains if market conditions hold. But many investors are looking beyond meme coins altogether, favouring tokens with real-world use and straightforward utility. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: The Battle To Stay Relevant Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently trading at around $0.0000098. The project has refined the meme coin idea that Dogecoin (DOGE) first made popular, expanding it with a full ecosystem and token economy. Remittix (RTX) , on the other hand, is taking things a step further. It marks the next stage of evolution, crypto designed for real-world use, not just community hype. As meme coins fade, projects like Remittix prove that success now comes from solving problems, not chasing hype. RTX offers early entry into a working platform already attracting global interest for investors seeking a new altcoin to watch or a high-growth crypto for 2025–2026. Why Investors Are Pivoting Toward Utility Projects Like Remittix As meme coins struggle to sustain value, investors rotate into DeFi projects and low-cap crypto gems with practical use. One name at the centre of that shift is Remittix (RTX), a PayFi token that blends DeFi and real-world payments, allowing users to send crypto directly to bank accounts in over 30 countries. Remittix (RTX) has already raised $27.5 million and gained 40,000+ holders, thanks to its working wallet beta that processes real crypto-to-bank transactions. Remittix is built on Ethereum and expanding to Solana, Polygon, and Avalanche, making it a fully cross-chain DeFi project. Here’s how Remittix (RTX) stands out: $27.5 million raised and 40,000+ investors Wallet beta live, supporting instant crypto-to-bank transfers Ranked #1 on CertiK Skynet for project security 15% USDT referral rewards, paid daily Confirmed BitMart and LBank listings Active $250,000 Remittix Giveaway Remittix (RTX) is being called the next 100x crypto and one of the best DeFi projects of 2025. It offers more than speculation; it solves real payment problems through blockchain. With its low gas fee crypto model and verified audit, analysts see it as one of the best long-term crypto investments this cycle. While SHIB and DOGE remain community-driven, Remittix (RTX) is leading the shift toward function-driven crypto, defining where investor confidence is heading. Remittix Could Redefine What “Killer” Really Means The Shiba Inu price prediction shows recovery potential, but the competition is evolving. Dogecoin still dominates brand power, while Shiba Inu is trying to reinvent itself through Shibarium. Yet the rise of Remittix (RTX) shows the market’s changing direction, from memes to money movement, hype to utility. SHIB will have to follow the same path that projects like Remittix are taking if it wants to beat Dogecoin.

We’re not quite sure that’s totally legal. But according to the Financial Times, analysts are afraid this loop could at the very least turn into an AI bubble , echoing the excess of the dot-com era, or perhaps even worse. The most striking example came in late September, when Nvidia announced plans to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI. The move would give Sam Altman’s ChatGPT maker even more access to Nvidia’s chips to train and run its next generation of models. That’s not all. Nvidia has also poured $6.3 billion into CoreWeave, a data center operator it already owns 7% of, and is reported to have invested another $2 billion into Elon Musk’s xAI. Meanwhile, OpenAI has expanded its own network, cutting deals with Oracle, CoreWeave, and AMD, and on Monday tapped Broadcom to build its first in-house AI processors. AI giants build circular investments Wall Street analysts say this new pattern shows how AI infrastructure providers are turning their customers into investment targets. Nvidia and others are putting money directly into the firms that rely on their hardware, and those firms are, in some cases, reinvesting right back into the suppliers. It’s a feedback loop powered by capital instead of consumers. Blackstone president Jonathan Gray called it a top concern for investors. Speaking at the Financial Times Private Capital Summit in London, Jonathan said his firm now treats AI risk as a key part of every deal review. “We’ve told our credit and equity teams: address AI on the first pages of your investment memos,” he said. He explained that AI has already changed business models and cost jobs, forcing investors to confront both sides of its impact. The rise in high valuations for loss-making AI firms, combined with these circular financial ties, has stirred fresh talk of a bubble. Jonathan compared it to the frenzy before the 2000 crash, saying, “Think of Pets.com in 2000.” Still, he said AI’s reach may be underestimated, with the potential to wipe out entire industries while adding trillions in corporate value. “We’re forcing the conversation,” he said. “Acting like it’s business as usual would be a mistake.” Markets turn cautious amid AI euphoria The pressure is now spilling into Wall Street’s broader market mood. The S&P 500 gained 1.7% last week, almost entirely from a Monday rebound, but remains stuck in a tight range between 6,550 and 6,750. CME data shows majority of investors are still betting on two more Federal Reserve rate cuts this year and a strong economy to keep stocks high into New Year’s. But Bank of America last week said that its high-net-worth clients now hold 64% of their assets in equities, close to the two-decade high from 2021. That means less room for fresh buying, even with the market chasing AI-linked gains. Hedge funds that missed the rally earlier this year have re-entered heavily, reaching record leverage before pulling back last week. Goldman Sachs’ Tony Pasquariello, head of hedge-fund coverage, said funds just executed “the largest selling of both U.S. and global equities since April,” adding that there was also “a big increase in macro shorts.” Tony pointed out that while “plenty of length” still remains among investors, “the market did clean up some risk over the past two weeks,” and predicted that “as we move through October, the technicals will improve.” Get up to $30,050 in trading rewards when you join Bybit today",Tech|AMD|Broadcom|CoreWeave|Nvidia|Oracle|xAI,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MACROECONOMICS|MARKET|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-19 14:11:41

Although there are speculations that these addresses may belong to the project team, analysis points to a different picture. According to Bubblemaps data, the addresses in question are likely managed by an external group engaging in arbitrage or quantitative trading with Binance Alpha tokens. The data indicates that these addresses similarly withdraw BNB from Binance, were all created on March 25, and exhibit similar trading activity. Related News: Wash Trading Suspicion for a Whale on Binance: They Are Targeting One Altcoin in Particular However, these addresses have reportedly been conducting thousands of transactions in dozens of different Alpha tokens every day since July, with the transaction numbers ranging from several thousand per day to over 45,000 per month. Each address has reportedly traded more than 240 different tokens in the last 30 days. This frequency of transactions suggests an arbitrage team using automated trading bots rather than typical user behavior. According to the Bubblemaps report, all 60 wallets exhibiting similar behavior were created with 1 BNB funding from Binance around 11:00 AM on March 25. These 60 wallets are among COAI's most profitable investors, with a single entity believed to control over 50% of the top 100 COAI traders. While there is no evidence of any direct project team link, this level of automation and process density is considered “unusual.” *This is not investment advice.

Industry experts tracking Apple’s supply chain, mobile carriers, and customer wait times revealed that early demand for the revamped iPhone exceeded expectations ahead of its September debut. Following these impressive results, several analysts shared their predictions that the tech giant’s smartphone sales this fiscal year will increase by 4%, reaching a new record of $209.3 billion, according to data from Visible Alpha. For 2026, this growth rate is anticipated to further surge to around 5% with sales of iPhone hitting an all-time high of $218.9 billion. Tech analysts acknowledged the remarkable sales of Apple’s iPhone 17 this year The remarkable sales of Apple’s iPhone 17 have significantly improved market sentiment as the company approaches the crucial holiday shopping season. This occurs despite several delays encountered during the release of artificial intelligence features and the impacts of US President Donald Trump’s tariffs on the tech giant’s share price over the last year. Gene Munster, a managing partner and co-founder at Deepwater, commented on the topic of discussion. Munster pointed out that it is accurate to conclude that the launch of iPhone 17 was unexpected compared to what Wall Street predicted at the end of August. When tracking Apple’s performance in 2023 and 2024, tech analysts discovered that in its 2023 financial year, which ended in September, the company encountered a decline of 2% in its smartphone revenues. Later in 2024, it faced a flat performance. This decline triggered the analysts to investigate the root cause of the poor performance. Their analysis found that people practiced cautious spending because they had spent heavily on electronics during the pandemic. However, after implementing updates to the iPhone’s cameras, displays, and batteries this year, it was observed that many individuals began to replace their old devices with the newly released iPhone version. This week, analysts from Bank of America referenced data from Apple’s stores and carriers, noting that iPhone 17’s shipping times are longer than in previous years. This could suggest an enthusiastic interest from iPhone buyers, said Munster, further illustrating that when lead times are longer, it typically means that there is an improved product cycle. He also highlighted that wait times for the newly released iPhone are approximately 13% longer than last year’s, possibly demonstrating a bigger “upgrade cycle.” The launch of Apple’s iPhone 17 solidifies the tech giant’s position as a leader in the industry Apple plans to report its fiscal fourth quarter results on October 30, which would include sales details from the first weeks of the launch of iPhone 17. “Apple is having a great quarter for sure,” said Francisco Jeronimo from IDC. “I cannot remember the last time I saw lines outside the Apple store like I have seen this year.” Jeronimo also compared the checks of Apple’s supply chain during the launch of iPhone 17 and iPhone 16 and concluded that the orders for the iPhone 17 are much stronger than those from last year, when the iPhone 16 was launched. Meanwhile, analysts observed Apple’s unit sales and highlighted that the sales of the iPhone are mostly steady. Following this observation, units are predicted to remain around 235 million between Apple’s fiscal years 2024 and 2026, according to data from Visible Alpha. By 2027, analysts speculate that the company will start to sell more than 240 million units, and by the end of the decade, that figure could escalate to almost 260 million. There are also rumours about an upcoming launch of a foldable iPhone next year. Notably, Apple has stopped disclosing the number of units it sells. Instead, the tech company aims to make investors pay more attention to its revenue. The tech giant argues that substantial increases in its growth come from the clients it already has.

The project’s official X account posted a short teaser showing stacked glowing cards with a payment chime, igniting widespread speculation about a Solana-branded debit or credit card. The video, ending with the date “October 20, 2025,” suggests an upcoming reveal that could redefine Solana’s role in blockchain-based payments. SOL Enters a Key Accumulation Phase According to CryptoPulse, Solana has firmly established an accumulation zone between $175 and $200. The daily chart highlights repeated rebounds from lower wicks near $182, signaling strong demand. This region has consistently attracted buyers, confirming it as a crucial support base. Consequently, a breakout above $200 could trigger a rally toward the $270–$280 range. Institutional participation remains steady, with ETF approvals adding momentum to Solana’s bullish structure. Moreover, growing interest from major funds underscores Solana’s growing role as a high-performance blockchain capable of rivaling Ethereum. The network’s expanding developer base, low transaction costs, and scaling efficiency continue to reinforce long-term confidence. Hence, the current consolidation may serve as a launchpad for renewed upward momentum once broader market sentiment improves. Short-Term Dip Remains Possible While the broader trend remains constructive, Crypto Tony cautions that a short-term correction could still occur. He suggests that SOL might dip toward $155–$160 over the coming weeks after testing $192 resistance. Source: X This range coincides with earlier accumulation zones, indicating that any pullback may present another opportunity for reaccumulation. Such corrective movements are common in ongoing uptrends, often helping reset momentum before the next leg higher.

From October 20 to 23, Beijing’s top officials are meeting to lay out their five-year goals, and tech is expected to dominate the agenda. The country’s government isn’t backing off, despite trade tensions, and analysts believe China’s equity space still has solid ground, mainly in local tech. According to CNBC , some investment strategists are staying bullish, especially after DeepSeek rolled out its surprise AI model earlier this year. The launch showed the world that China can still compete in artificial intelligence, even with U.S. chip sanctions in place. Since then, the government has promoted DeepSeek and other local projects as proof of its capabilities and has responded to Washington’s policies with new tariffs, port fees, and export rules. Beijing focuses on industrial AI as foreign funds stay selective Liqian Ren, head of quantitative investment at WisdomTree, said optimism toward the U.S. market has a spillover effect on China, and as long as that optimism holds, investors will keep positions in Chinese equities. Liqian said falling interest rates from the U.S. Federal Reserve are boosting both economies. Ren added that international traders are no longer dismissing China altogether but are beginning to treat it as a longer-term bet, especially in technology. The optimism around tech started picking up after DeepSeek’s launch . It wasn’t just the surprise that impressed investors; it was the timing too. The U.S. had restricted chip exports, and yet China still produced a model good enough to be mentioned in the same sentence as OpenAI. That event forced global investors to reevaluate the entire China tech narrative. Ren explained that Beijing is now putting its money behind industrial applications of AI; stuff like automation, software for factories, and enterprise infrastructure. She called this move a “fundamental shift.” Sunil Tirumalai, the global emerging markets strategist at UBS, said in a Friday note that the return on invested capital in the MSCI China index has been improving, even when internet stocks like Alibaba are left out. He compared the performance with India, which has mostly gone flat. Sunil noted that when you include China’s internet companies, returns actually outpace India. The takeaway: China may still offer more upside, especially in industrial and AI-focused equities. Ren said that trying to figure out whether China or the U.S. will “win” in the tech space is pointless right now. “It’s so long term right now it’s very hard to really draw a conclusion,” she said. But if someone’s investment timeline is long, she believes “it’s still a good time to position.” Mainland stocks edge ahead as Hong Kong takes a hit Equities took a dive on Friday after investors reacted to rising concerns about U.S. regional bank loans. The Shanghai Composite lost almost 2%, while the Hang Seng Index fell nearly 2.5%. That sharp drop added fuel to the idea that mainland-listed shares, often called A Shares, might now be a better hold than stocks traded in Hong Kong. Laura Wang, Chief China Equity Strategist at Morgan Stanley, said in a late Friday note, “Do not buy the dip yet.” She warned that Hong Kong stocks tend to follow the U.S. market closely and pointed out that the Hang Seng has already jumped more than 25% this year, compared to just over 12% for the S&P 500. That gap could spook traders into cashing out early. Wang said her team is now “tactically overweight A shares vs. Hong Kong,” mostly because of trade and credit worries. For now, she’s sticking with Chinese companies that show consistent earnings and solid dividend history. As the leadership summit kicks off, China is expected to release its third-quarter GDP on Monday. Jing Liu, Chief Economist for Greater China at HSBC, said that the next five-year plan will focus on new technologies, especially AI, robotics, biotech, and semiconductors. Her firm’s equity strategy group had already warned earlier in the week about growing market volatility, but said they still expect tech innovation to keep pushing the market up. Analysts named three specific stocks that they believe will beat earnings estimates: Gigadevice, a semiconductor company in Shanghai; Yonyou, which builds enterprise software, also in Shanghai; and Inovance, a factory automation firm listed in Shenzhen.

Core Features MamaFi balances unyielding freedom of expression with social responsibility, creating a secure ecosystem for authentic communication: Verified Accounts for Protection: Journalists, activists, government representatives, and public figures can obtain verified status through a KYC process, granting them a ""digital passport"" that certifies identity. Once verified, content cannot be arbitrarily altered or removed, shielding it from censorship like a knight's coat of arms. User Data Sovereignty: Users decide what personal information to share, with whom, and for how long. Blockchain ensures data is guarded in an ""impregnable safe,"" accessible only with user authorization, preventing misuse while allowing intervention against illicit purposes. Censorship Resistance with Accountability: The platform monitors initial interactions via a traditional social network layer to prevent criminal activities like terrorism, pedophilia, or drug trafficking. Decentralized blockchain operations for verified users ensure immutability, but freedom is protected only when it respects others' rights—no haven for miscreants. Immutable Transactions: Integrated with Ethereum, all interactions occur via decentralized wallets using public keys, eliminating intermediaries and ensuring fraud-proof, transparent exchanges recorded forever on the blockchain. These features make MamaFi a beacon for digital independence, where voices matter and freedom is a mission. Tokenomics As a meme coin on Ethereum—the ""Blockchain Queen"" chosen for its security, scalability via Layer 2 and Ethereum 2.0, decentralization under high pressure, and robust smart contract ecosystem—MAMA powers the MamaFi platform. Ethereum's resilience supports the explosive growth of meme coins, handling millions of transactions without compromising integrity. Notably, Donald J. Trump holds over $2.8 million in Ethereum and has earned $4.8 million from NFT licensing, totaling $7.6 million in crypto-related gains, underscoring its strategic appeal. MamaFi positions MAMA at the heart of this dynamic market, enabling efficient scaling for high-volume adoption and viral trading tied to global events. Team Background The MamaFi team remains private and anonymous as a strategic safeguard against forces seeking to undermine free platforms, drawing lessons from cases like the arrest of Telegram's founder for resisting censorship. This anonymity protects the project from becoming a ""weak link,"" allowing it to focus on its mission without personal risks. Behind the scenes are brilliant minds with deep experience in banking and government, united to defend digital freedom. Revealing more could jeopardize the ecosystem, but their expertise ensures MamaFi's innovative structure combines decentralization with vigilant oversight. Roadmap Highlights MamaFi's journey emphasizes building a censorship-resistant future on Ethereum: Launch and Platform Foundation: Establish core decentralized social features with verified accounts and data controls, integrated directly with Ethereum for secure, user-led transactions. Meme Coin Ecosystem Growth: Leverage Ethereum's tools to support meme coin development, positioning MamaFi as a hub for viral, decentralized applications amid rising adoption. Strategic Media Positioning: Harness the polarizing symbolism of a Donald J. Trump parody to fuel virality, polarization, and global visibility, amplified by associations with influential figures like Elon Musk, turning media waves into sustained trading and community momentum. Scalability and Expansion: Advance with Ethereum's Layer 2 to boost transaction capacity, enabling the platform to handle growing demand while expanding into a resilient ecosystem for protected expression and meme coin innovation.

Over 45,000 BTC, worth nearly $4.8 billion, has been withdrawn from centralized exchanges since early October, signaling that investors are moving assets into cold storage rather than keeping them available for trading. Bitcoin Supply on Exchanges Declines Sharply A lower exchange balance generally means fewer coins are available for sale, reducing immediate market supply. When combined with stable or rising demand, this creates conditions that can accelerate upward price moves. The latest withdrawal trend points to growing investor confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term potential, despite recent volatility. Chart: Bitcoin exchange balances have fallen to six-year lows, signaling increased long-term accumulation. Source: Glassnode (2025). By contrast, inflows to exchanges tend to rise during uncertainty, when traders seek liquidity. The opposite is now occurring: outflows are increasing even as prices remain subdued. This behavior suggests that many participants see the recent correction as an accumulation opportunity, not a risk event. At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $108,417, up 1.34% in 24 hours, with a total market capitalization of $2.16 trillion. The circulating supply stands at 19.93 million BTC, leaving fewer than 1.1 million coins yet to be mined before the network reaches its hard cap of 21 million. Long-Term Holders Maintain Control On-chain metrics show that long-term investors remain active despite short-term uncertainty. According to Santiment, the 30-day Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio is -7.56%, indicating that recent buyers are holding small unrealized losses. Historically, negative MVRV readings have marked accumulation phases, where Bitcoin trades below perceived fair value. In previous cycles, similar setups preceded price recoveries as selling pressure eased and confidence returned. Data also shows that leveraged positions are at multi-year lows, reducing the risk of forced liquidations. With derivatives markets showing more balanced sentiment, the environment supports gradual accumulation and consolidation before a broader recovery phase. BTC Price Analysis: Recovery Within Reach From a technical standpoint, Bitcoin price prediction is turning slightly bullish as it’s forming a symmetrical triangle pattern on the two-hour chart. This structure often signals a potential breakout. The price is testing the 200-EMA resistance at $108,500, while maintaining higher lows since the $104,500 bottom on October 17. The RSI has climbed from 35 to 59, indicating improving momentum without entering overbought territory. A breakout above $110,850 could open the path toward $113,500 and $115,960, key resistance zones within the previous descending channel. Failure to hold above $107,400, however, could trigger a pullback toward $104,550 or $102,000. For traders, a long position above $108,800 with a stop below $107,400 presents a measured opportunity targeting $113,500. If strength persists, Bitcoin could approach $116,000 before year-end. With exchange supply tightening and long-term holders accumulating, Bitcoin’s structural setup appears increasingly bullish. As institutional demand rebuilds and macro pressures stabilize, the supply squeeze may set the stage for the next major price expansion. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of BTC on Solana? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the Bitcoin ecosystem. While BTC remains the gold standard for security, Bitcoin Hyper adds what it always lacked: Solana-level speed. Built as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), it merges Bitcoin’s stability with Solana’s high-performance framework. The result: lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation, all secured by Bitcoin. Audited by Consult, the project emphasizes trust and scalability as adoption builds. And momentum is already strong. The presale has surpassed $23.9 million, with tokens priced at just $0.013125 before the next increase. As Bitcoin activity climbs and demand for efficient BTC-based apps rises, Bitcoin Hyper stands out as the bridge uniting two of crypto’s biggest ecosystems. If Bitcoin built the foundation, Bitcoin Hyper could make it fast, flexible, and fun again.

According to Rowan, Europe is “at war with itself” as regulation has become excessive, stifling growth and making it hard to keep up with the US. As far as he is concerned, the approach is self-sabotaging, especially amid the EU’s push for greater economic competitiveness. Marc Rowan nudges Europe to relax regulations Rowan, who co-founded the New York-based private capital group, believes Europe has barely made any progress in implementing the reforms needed to secure investment and revive the region’s ailing economy. “I see Europe a little bit at war with itself with respect to financial regulation,” Rowan told the Financial Times. “On the political side, you have all the signals of embracing risk-taking, equitisation and private markets. [But] on the regulatory side, not so much.” He highlighted how there are lots of problems currently plaguing the US, but in the UK, those problems are worse. Mario Draghi, the former head of the European Central Bank, last year warned that there could be an “existential challenge” if the continent is unable to improve its productivity. If it is able to, Rowan projects, on a relative basis, that Europe will grow much more rapidly than the US, where private capital is concerned, because it needs it more. According to him, European businesses and governments are embracing private capital groups to encourage competitiveness in their technology sectors. “They do not want to be, I saw the word this morning, a technology colony,” said Rowan . “They want to be leaders — they want to actually have their own infrastructure, their own defence base, their own everything. To do that, you’re going to need massive amounts of capital.” Marc Rowan sees potential in Europe despite comments Apollo already has considerable clout in the investment community with more than $500 billion in AUM. Still, it is ever working on expanding, and it sees Europe as fertile grounds despite Rowan’s criticism of its approach to financial regulation. It estimates a $15 trillion opportunity in Europe and the Middle East for household assets, indicating a significant market for private capital managers. In fact, last month, Apollo Global Management launched three new private capital funds targeting wealthy individual investors in Europe, with a focus on private credit, diversified credit, and private markets secondaries. According to a Bloomberg report, investors who want to participate will need a minimum investment of €10,000, with opportunities to add capital monthly and a quarterly redemption limit of 5%. This move puts Apollo in a competitive race with other firms like Blackstone and Ares Management, also targeting wealthy individuals, with Blackstone’s ECRED fund holding €2.7 billion and Ares’ fund at €4.6 billion. “It’s a huge market which today is much more accessible for private capital managers, and with an investor base that increasingly wants to access private markets,” Véronique Fournier, Apollo’s head of EMEA wealth distribution. said.

The company is reportedly leading an effort to raise at least $1 billion to build a digital asset treasury focused on accumulating XRP. This development, first reported by Bloomberg, involves a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) designed to purchase XRP from the open market. While Ripple already holds billions of tokens in escrow , the decision to raise external funds for additional purchases has been viewed by some as a deliberate signal of confidence in its native asset. It's great Ripple is buying XRP, but you may ask yourself why would they when they have over 30BN in escrow they can easily access 500M XRP each month? Well, that is the exciting part. Ripple is building confidence in XRP, and using the SPAC to put upward demand pressure on open… https://t.co/Fx95SgTxBH — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) October 17, 2025 A Bullish Perspective on the Move Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode), a software engineer and well-known voice within the XRP community, provided insight into why the move is significant. He acknowledged that some may question why Ripple would buy XRP when it already controls well over 30 billion tokens in escrow. In his view, the answer lies in strategy rather than necessity. Van Code described the development as “the exciting part,” suggesting that Ripple’s approach is not about access to supply but about building market confidence in XRP . He explained that by using the SPAC to apply upward demand pressure on the open market, Ripple would effectively extract XRP for several purposes, including operational use, escrow management, or treasury holdings. He added that the company “may even use it to build up mega LPs on the XRPL,” referring to liquidity pools on the XRP Ledger that could strengthen market depth and efficiency. His conclusion was clear: this development is a super bullish signal for XRP. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why This Matters for XRP Rather than simply expanding its reserves, Ripple is attempting to reinforce XRP’s market structure. By purchasing XRP from the open market through a structured financial vehicle, the company introduces new demand that can tighten available supply. This mechanism can help support price stability while demonstrating to institutions and investors that Ripple is committed to the long-term utility of XRP . The creation of a dedicated treasury also adds a layer of institutional maturity to Ripple’s operations. It establishes a transparent and structured way to manage token holdings, potentially improving liquidity for Ripple’s payment and liquidity solutions. Moreover, by separating the new treasury from its escrowed funds, Ripple positions itself to manage market activity more dynamically without altering its existing release schedule . Ripple’s plan strengthens institutional confidence in XRP. It signals long-term commitment, disciplined capital management, and a strong belief in the digital asset’s continued relevance for payments and tokenized liquidity across global markets.

BLOX's active management and flexible options strategies drive its success, enabling a 38.76% annualized yield without sacrificing growth for income. Key risks include short performance history, reliance on manager skill, and broad crypto industry exposure, making conviction in the sector essential. I rate BLOX a buy for income investors bullish on crypto, recommending it as a partial or full allocation within cryptocurrency portfolios. High-yield ETFs that offer more than 20% yields have become extremely popular over the last few years as investors are allured by the idea of earning a full-time income with just a few hundred thousand dollars invested. Certainly, being able to retire on a $100K per year income with just $200-300K invested is amazing, but it's almost always too good to be true. You see, nearly all of these high-yield ETFs come with the same catch. In return for high yields, upside is capped, NAV is lost, and funds are often doomed to continual reverse splits and dividend payout reductions to maintain lofty high yields. That said, not all high-yield ETFs suffer from this fate, and the Nicholas Crypto Income ETF ( BLOX ) is looking to prove itself. In BLOX's short history since its inception on June 16, 2025, the fund has done exceptionally well. It has outperformed just about all its high-yield crypto peers in both total and price returns. Moreover, BLOX has even outperformed Bitcoin itself while paying weekly distributions, with the most recent one on October 10, 2025, annualizing to a 38.76% yield. Of course, there are only a couple of months of data for a fund whose performance relies heavily on successful active management, and it is prudent for investors to expect that BLOX can underperform just as much as it outperformed. Even so, BLOX can still be valuable to income investors bullish on the cryptocurrency industry. The fund's active selection of assets has so far aided in the fund's performance, and its options trading strategies have the flexibility to allow the fund to capture more upside than the typical covered call ETF. I rate BLOX a buy and recommend income investors use it as a part of or as their entire allocation to cryptocurrencies. BLOX's Outperformance And Weekly Payouts BLOX has performed beyond expectations since its inception. Price and total returns have far exceeded all popular competitors at 27.55% and 45.78%, respectively. Other crypto portfolio plus income funds, such as the REX Crypto Equity Premium Income ETF ( CEPI ) and YieldMax Crypto Industry & Tech Portfolio Option Income ETF ( LFGY ), have offered the next best returns, but still lagged BLOX by more than 20%, not to mention that many similar funds, such as LFGY, have seen share price declines. Data by YCharts BLOX has not sacrificed yield for growth nor vice versa. Though not as high as LFGY's 80.41% , BLOX's most recent distribution still annualizes to an approximate 38.76% yield and is in line with CEPI's 41.58% . These distributions are also paid weekly and have been generally pretty stable with a standard deviation of 1.17%. What's good to note as well is that in various interviews with the fund manager, David Nicholas, he has mentioned that the fund internally attempts to generate an annualized 50% of its NAV in option premiums every week, but will generally distribute about 36% and leave the rest for reinvestment. These numbers, of course, can change without warning, but they do help set some expectations for income investors. Data by YCharts However, what's truly astounding is not BLOX's outperformance relative to other income funds, but its outperformance relative to Bitcoin itself. In the time since BLOX's inception, BLOX has generated a 45.78% total return when the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) had only generated 3.24% and a popular Bitcoin treasury company in Strategy ( MSTR ) had actually fallen significantly in value. Data by YCharts How can this be possible? Well, let's take a deeper look at how BLOX operates. BLOX's Active Management Is Key Active management is the key to BLOX's success. The fund has a 1.03% expense ratio that goes towards fund managers who are consistently working to find profitable option trades and cryptocurrency picks. This is a far more sophisticated fund than your typical covered call ETF. Per its prospectus, BLOX can use a variety of options selling strategies, including but not limited to selling covered calls, credit spreads, diagonal call spreads, cash-secured puts, calendar call spreads, and collars. This flexibility has been key to BLOX's success because it has largely been selling put spreads on its equity positions and call spreads on its spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF holdings. The put spreads have been the main contributors to BLOX's strong returns, as it is a strategy that does not cap upsides. Instead, selling puts is a strategy that has more downside risk, as you're essentially writing a contract that states you will buy the underlying asset at a certain strike price even if the asset falls below that price. If the asset rises or remains above your strike price, the contract will expire worthless, and you'll keep the option premiums earned. And in the case of BLOX, many of these option trades have been hugely profitable, as many of BLOX's underlying equity holdings have had impressive returns since BLOX's inception. The following charts compare the total returns of BLOX's underlying equity holdings since BLOX's inception. Data by YCharts Data by YCharts Looking at BLOX's underlying holdings is a good segue into a discussion about the second part of BLOX's active management. Unlike many actively-managed options trading ETFs, which will typically have constant or passively managed underlying holdings to write options on, BLOX's underlying holdings are actively selected. The fund managers have provided guidance in their prospectus where 25-50% of assets will go toward equity holdings related to cryptocurrency, 25-50% toward crypto assets generally via ETFs, and 25-50% toward trading collateral and buying protective options as needed. In each category, BLOX has provided further guidance. Equity holdings related to cryptocurrency, or ""Crypto Industry Companies"" as BLOX defines it, include companies that derive 50% or more of their revenues from the following sectors: Crypto asset mining Blockchain technology development Crypto asset trading platforms Digital wallet providers Decentralized finance (""DEFI"") platforms Companies involved in the development of smart contract technology Manufacturers and distributors of hardware related to crypto asset Companies providing blockchain-as-a-service Interactive platforms and services related to NFTs Crypto asset cross-border payments Crypto asset tokenization Crypto asset decentralized lending Companies that hold at least $50 million of crypto assets on their balance sheet A broad selection criterion was purposely developed to make BLOX a fund for those bullish on the cryptocurrency industry as a whole rather than individual coins or companies. That is why BLOX also uniquely holds and writes options on both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Currently, BLOX has an approximate 14% weighting in each of the VanEck Bitcoin ETF ( HODL ) and Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ETF ( FBTC ) and another 9% in the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF ( ETHA ). The latter is another big reason why BLOX has outperformed Bitcoin as Ethereum has had a fantastic run during a time when Bitcoin had ultimately traded flat. Data by YCharts BLOX's Key Risks But just as how active management has led to significant outperformance, it can also become the reason for significant underperformance. What happens if the fund managers select the wrong options strategy and/or the wrong stock at the wrong time? If we just take a look at selling put options as an example, if BLOX's equity holdings had significantly fallen in value instead of rising, those put options would have led to increased losses and downsides. Investors need to remember that we have been in market conditions that have generally been very good for cryptocurrency. The four months since BLOX's inception are too short to give investors adequate information on how BLOX will perform during crypto bear markets. And speaking of crypto bear markets, the state and future of cryptocurrency is naturally another risk to consider. After all, the high yields in these crypto income funds are only produced because of the high implied volatility (""IV"") in the underlying assets, and this high IV comes from the uncertain future ahead of various cryptocurrencies and related companies. Just Bitcoin itself has many polarizing and conflicting viewpoints. Saifedean Ammous, the author of the popular book, The Bitcoin Standard , had expressed how Bitcoin was supposed to become a reserve currency that the global economy pegs their currencies to similar to how gold operated in the past. Roger Ver, author of Hijacking Bitcoin , however, discussed in his book how Bitcoin was never supposed to be a speculative store of value and was originally designed to be a medium of exchange. Regardless of what you believe, the future of cryptocurrency is very uncertain, and you must have conviction in the industry for an investment in BLOX to make sense. Additionally, if you are an investor who does have a particular view on cryptocurrencies, BLOX's goals of generating exposure to the cryptocurrency industry as a whole may not be in your favor. For example, some may have heard of the term "" Bitcoin Maximalism ."" This is the belief that Bitcoin will be the only relevant cryptocurrency in the future, and if you hold this belief, BLOX would contradict your view with its large exposures to Ethereum. BLOX can also be a contradictory holding for investors who view cryptocurrencies as a separate asset class to be diversified in. Publicly-traded cryptocurrency companies ultimately do not escape broad market sell-offs, and this risk is even more pronounced considering BLOX's holdings in NVDA and TSM, which are companies whose fundamental business models are not driven by cryptocurrencies themselves. BLOX Verdict Overall, however, BLOX has stood out from other cryptocurrency income funds with its impressive total returns and consistent weekly payouts. The fund does come with risks in its very limited history and reliance on active management, but the flexibility that this active management provides does make BLOX appealing to income investors bullish on the cryptocurrency industry as a whole. I rate BLOX a Buy and recommend investors primarily consider it within their allocations to cryptocurrencies.",BLOX,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|ETH,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-10-19 15:02:27

While Cardano is showing signs of exhaustion after the recent run-up, XRP is still stuck beneath key resistance areas, and expectations are for a possible re-test of $1 in the near term. While experiencing these fluctuations, Remittix (RTX) has been hailed by analysts as the currency to anchor portfolios because of its consistent progress, transparent team operations, and rapidly growing real-world usage in the DeFi payment arena. Cardano and XRP Market Overview Cardano is traded at $0.6334, declining by 3.86% over the last 24 hours with a capitalization of $22.71 billion and trading volume of $658.87 million, up by 64.09%. Despite ongoing network developments, the price of ADA continues to be under pressure as investors wait and see before other developments in the broader markets. XRP, meanwhile, is trading at $2.35, 12.11% lower over the last day, with a market capitalization of $148.16 billion. Volume has climbed to $20.97 billion, a 325.59% increase as traders rebalance amidst short-term volatility and potential bounce near the $1 mark. Remittix (RTX): A Robust DeFi Player Below $1 In such movements, Remittix (RTX) at $0.1166 per token is a project that highlights affordability combined with real-world traction.

Vincent Karremans, the Netherlands’ economy minister, said on Sunday that he will meet a senior Chinese government official within days to figure out how to end the dispute. The confrontation began when the Dutch government seized control of Nexperia NV , a key supplier of chips used in cars, on September 30, triggering China’s retaliation, which just happened to be a ban on exports of the company’s finished products. The two sides are now scrambling to prevent a supply chain crisis that could hit automakers worldwide, from Volkswagen to BYD. Karremans said the Chinese “have the impression that we are teaming up with the Americans,” but insisted the intervention was about protecting Europe’s technology, not about politics. Karremans explained that the move was meant to stop Zhang Xuezheng, Nexperia’s former Chinese CEO, from transferring operations and intellectual property out of Europe. “This is being discussed at the highest level,” Karremans said during an interview on Dutch TV show Buitenhof, confirming that Dutch diplomats have been in constant contact with their Chinese counterparts as talks intensify. China bans exports as chip supply fears grow The fight over Nexperia has put automakers on edge, because the company’s chips aren’t high-end semiconductors, but they’re mass-produced in huge numbers, mostly from its factory in Hamburg, Germany, before being shipped to China for packaging and distribution across the global auto industry. With China now blocking exports, European carmakers are warning of shortages that could stall production if new suppliers aren’t found soon. “We have a mutually dependent relationship,” Karremans said. “Everyone has an interest to solve this together.” Nexperia, which posted $331 million in profit in 2024, is one of Wingtech Technology’s most valuable assets, and it produces standard power and analog chips that every car on the road depends on, from simple sensors to control units. For China, the ban is leverage, but for Europe, it’s a massive headache. Still, Chinese automakers also rely heavily on Nexperia’s output, creating pressure on both governments to find a middle ground before the crisis drags on. Nexperia China rebels as management war escalates While politicians trade statements, Nexperia China has gone rogue. Over the weekend, its management issued a letter to employees, telling them to “follow local management orders and ignore instructions from the Dutch head office.” The message, shared on the company’s Chinese social media account, declared that Nexperia China was an “independent Chinese entity.” It said workers “have the right to reject external instructions” from Europe, and doing so “will not form any breach of work discipline or regulations.” The directive applies to Nexperia’s packaging plant in Dongguan, which produces about 70 percent of the company’s annual output, as well as branches in Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen, and Wuxi. It also noted that salaries are paid locally, not by the headquarters in Nijmegen. The move openly defies Dutch control, setting up a direct confrontation between The Hague and Wingtech Technology, which bought Nexperia in 2019. The rebellion follows the Dutch decision to oust Zhang Xuezheng from his post and take control of management, a step justified on national-security grounds. That decision led China’s Ministry of Commerce on October 4 to impose new export restrictions on Nexperia’s Chinese subsidiary and its subcontractors. Workers at the Dongguan site told The Post last week that they’re worried about being caught in the political fight, describing the plant as “a bargaining chip” in a battle far bigger than them.

This outlook comes as the meme cryptocurrency shows signs of short-term strength. As of press time, DOGE was valued at $0.19, gaining over 5% in the past 24 hours, while on the weekly time frame, it is up 4%. DOGE seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold In an X post on October 18, Martinez noted that DOGE is trading within an ascending parallel channel that stretches back to early 2023. Dogecoin is currently hovering near the lower boundary of this channel, a region that has historically acted as a reliable launch pad for rallies. DOGE price analysis chart. Source: TradingView At the same time, the token is defending a key support area around $0.16, near the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level. As long as this zone holds, bullish momentum could begin to build. The next immediate price barrier is $0.21, which must be breached for DOGE to confirm a recovery. If upward momentum strengthens, the first major resistance lies at $0.29, a level where the price previously faced strong rejection and which aligns with the mid-range trendline of the channel. A successful breakout above that level could propel DOGE toward $0.45 in the medium term. Under a strong bullish scenario, Martinez suggested Dogecoin could even reach $0.86 by 2026 if it follows the upper trajectory of the channel.

His outlook noted a steady uptrend forming since early 2024, with price consolidating around $0.19 and maintaining higher lows within an ascending channel. $DOGE is going to $1 sooner than you think. pic.twitter.com/T91VcP86Ud — Mags (@thescalpingpro) October 19, 2025 A projected rebound from current levels suggests a move through $0.40 and a potential breakout toward the upper resistance near $1.17 by 2026.

Albanese, who will be accompanied by his ministers for resources, Madeleine King, and for industry and innovation, Tim Ayres, described the White House meeting as “an important opportunity to consolidate and strengthen the Australia-US relationship.” The two leaders are expected to discuss strengthening supply chains for critical minerals used in defense technologies, renewable energy systems, and consumer electronics, an area where the West remains heavily dependent on China. Australia’s strategic minerals pitch Australia is among the world’s top producers of many of these minerals, and it has taken an active role in working to increase its mining capabilities and source for global partners. Its rare-earth offer is coming at a time when the US is exploring alternative supply chains for critical minerals, materials essential for electric vehicles, fighter jets, and semiconductors, among others, away from China. In recent months, the Albanese government has moved to assert a more active role in the global critical minerals market. The government is reportedly working with other stakeholders to finalize an A$1.2 billion ($782 million) strategic mineral stockpile plan that will also focus on future export deals and joint investments with partners. Jim Chalmers, Australia’s Treasurer, reportedly said last week that there was “no doubt” critical minerals would feature prominently in Albanese’s talks with Trump. Beyond the government level, companies are also moving in step. Earlier this month, Lynas Rare Earths, Australia’s largest producer, signed an agreement with US firm Noveon to supply rare earth magnets, strengthening industrial ties between the two countries. Balancing opportunity and risk The Albanese government is keen to attract American capital into its mining and processing sectors, but any arrangement that increases coordination with Washington will likely complicate relations with Beijing, Australia’s largest trading partner. According to reports, Albanese also plans to raise the future of the AUKUS security pact , signed in 2021 with the US and the UK to counter China’s influence in the Indo-Pacific. While AUKUS has become a pillar of Australia’s defense strategy, its implementation has slowed amid leadership changes in Washington, with the Pentagon reportedly still reviewing the agreement. For Canberra, the rare earths agenda and AUKUS are intertwined. Although both nations have been going at each other in a tit-for-tat fashion, especially with tariffs, since President Trump resumed office, China’s decision to impose export restrictions on gallium, graphite, and certain rare earth compounds has intensified concern in Washington. Analysts say the moves have reminded Western governments of their vulnerability in critical mineral supply chains. However, while Australia’s mineral endowment is vast, its refining and processing capacity lags far behind China’s, which controls nearly 90% of global processing. A potential mutual relationship Trump, who has prioritized trade re-industrialization in his second term, has framed resource independence as a national security issue. Albanese, on the other hand, faces domestic pressure to turn Australia’s critical minerals potential into a tangible economic advantage. The Washington visit could mark the start of a new phase in Australia-US resource diplomacy, and its success could help to position Australia as a cornerstone of an emerging “critical minerals alliance” among Western nations. Observers will be looking out for the proceeds of the meeting, watching out for the possible commitments, such as US equity stakes in Australian miners or long-term offtake agreements.

Bitcoin shattered records earlier this month, surging past $126,000 and securing its place as the year’s standout performer. Ethereum followed closely, hitting $4,900 in August, driven by renewed institutional inflows and the success of layer-2 protocols. Solana kicked off the party in January, skyrocketing to $294, proving high-performance chains remain central to this cycle’s narrative. However, as top assets print new all-time highs, attention is shifting toward meme-driven assets, especially Dogecoin (DOGE), which many believe is gearing up for its most significant rally since 2021. But before DOGE makes its long-awaited $1 move, another meme-born phenomenon is set to hit 20x as its presale momentum turns heads: Little Pepe (LILPEPE) . Little Pepe: The Meme Coin With a Mission While most meme coins rely purely on hype, Little Pepe blends internet culture with real tokenomics and community-driven growth. Inspired by the legendary Pepe meme, it’s built on an EVM-compatible, sniper-bot-resistant chain that ensures fair trading and ultra-low fees. There’s zero buy/sell tax and near-zero trading costs, features that make it ideal for meme coin traders looking for frictionless action. Unlike many meme coins, Little Pepe isn’t a short-term play; a dedicated Launchpad backs it for meme-only projects, designed to become the go-to ecosystem for launching the next viral tokens. The project is CertiK audited , and its strict vesting schedule (0% TGE, 3-month cliff, 5% monthly release) eliminates the pump-and-dump risks that have plagued similar projects. In short, Little Pepe’s design makes it both meme-worthy and investor-ready, a rare mix in the chaotic crypto world. Presale Momentum: $27 Raised and Counting The market has responded positively to Little Pepe’s presale. It has progressed to Stage 13, with each token costing $0.0022. Sales of almost 16 billion tokens have raised $27 million, and demand is rising as the project nears debut. To reward its growing community, Little Pepe has rolled out a mega giveaway worth over 15 ETH for top buyers from Stages 12–17, alongside its $777k Giveaway open to all holders. This two-tiered reward system fuels participation while spreading viral hype across social media. The token will debut at $0.003 at launch with a $300 million market cap. Given the presale traction, analysts believe Little Pepe could easily mirror the explosive post-listing runs seen with PEPE and BONK or even surpass them. Why Little Pepe Could 20x Before DOGE Hits $1 Dogecoin’s comeback story is writing itself. After falling below $0.10 during a market-wide selloff, DOGE quickly bounced back above $0.21, a 12% daily recovery, and analysts say the current structure looks identical to previous pre-rally consolidations. Many expect DOGE to hit $1 once the broader market regains momentum, marking a 370% rise from current levels. Dogecoin Price Chart | Source: Trader Tardigrade on X However, Little Pepe’s upside potential appears far greater before that move unfolds. With a presale price of $0.0022 and a launch target of $0.003, the coin has the setup for an early 20x surge if it captures even a fraction of DOGE’s meme market share. Its combination of real utility, strong presale demand, upcoming CEX listings, and audited credibility gives it a foundation few meme coins can match. The community is vibrant, the supply is well-structured, and the team’s approach to liquidity and post-launch stability makes it a standout candidate for short-term exponential gains. If DOGE is gearing up for a 4x to $1, Little Pepe could move 20x first, cementing its place as the next breakout meme coin in 2025. 2025 Bull Market Smartest Play The 2025 bull market has already crowned new winners; Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana have all rewritten their ATHs. Dogecoin’s turn is coming, but the real fireworks might start with Little Pepe. With $27 million raised, a growing army of holders, and a presale nearly halfway through its upper stages, this frog isn’t just leaping. It’s flying toward the spotlight. Join the presale before Stage 17 sells out at littlepepe.com because once Dogecoin hits $1, the Little Pepe whales may already be celebrating their 20x.

Here’s the Expert Opinion",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/did-the-recent-declines-terminate-the-bull-market-or-is-the-structure-preserved-heres-the-expert-opinion/,"Alex Thorn, Director of Research at Galaxy Digital, stated that despite the recent sharp decline, the structural bull cycle in the cryptocurrency market remains intact. He believes the next major rally will be fueled by AI investments, stablecoin growth, and asset tokenization. “AI spending is being supported by tech giants with strong balance sheets and government policies. Stablecoins are strengthening on-chain payment infrastructure, and tokenization is now moving from pilot to real-world use,” Thorn said. The recent cryptocurrency crash disrupted the October rally known as “Uptober.” Over $19 billion in leveraged positions were liquidated that day, while some altcoins lost between 50% and 75% of their value in minutes. Bitcoin briefly fell to $102,000 on October 10 from its peak of $126,300 on October 6. Ethereum, meanwhile, fell from a record high of $4,955 to $3,500. Solana (SOL) fell around 25%. Galaxy Research analyst Thad Pinakiewicz noted that the crash was caused by “high leverage, low order book depth, and a single macro news trigger.” Exchanges’ automatic deleveraging (ADL) mechanisms further squeezed liquidity. Thorn said that despite short-term fluctuations, there remains bullish potential for BTC, ETH, and SOL in the medium term. Thorn noted that risk appetite weakened in mid-October, amplified by the decline in microchip stocks, the Fed's hawkish rhetoric, and geopolitical tensions. Conversely, the record highs for gold and silver reflect investors' tendency to avoid risk. Related News: Are Bitcoin Miners Now Abandoning BTC to Work on Artificial Intelligence? Industry Members Respond While some investors argue that AI investments are beginning to “bubble,” Thorn disagrees. The analyst argues that the current situation differs from the 1999 dot-com bubble because today's investments are coming from giant tech companies, not speculators. For example, moves like BlackRock and Nvidia’s $40 billion acquisition of Aligned Data Centers, Meta’s new $1.5 billion data center deal, Microsoft’s Nscale collaboration, and Google’s OpenAI-Coreweave deal stand out as real cash investments in AI infrastructure. Furthermore, US government support for AI is seven times higher than internet investment in the 1990s. The $45 billion in incentives and $3.3 billion in AI R&D funding under the CHIPS Act demonstrate the strategic importance of this field. According to Thorn, AI could reach the scale of a new “Space Race” or “Manhattan Project.” “Markets rise by climbing the wall of worry. We're at that wall right now,” Thorn concluded. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Did the Recent Declines Terminate the Bull Market, or Is the Structure Preserved?

Big moves were made during the sell-off, and firms and investors are now weighing whether those buys mean confidence or simply a bet on a rebound. Large Scale Accumulation Continues According to onchain data from Arkham Intelligence and the tracker ‘BMNR Bullz’, BitMine Immersion Technologies bought a total of 379,271 ETH in three separate purchases: 202,037 ETH after the weekend crash, 104,336 ETH on Thursday, and 72,898 ETH on Saturday. Reports have disclosed the haul is worth almost $1.5 billion. The purchases have not been officially confirmed by BitMine, but the transfers were visible on public ledgers. BitMine’s Position And Timing BitMine is reported to hold more than 3 million ETH, which equates to about 2.5% of the entire supply, and that stash was valued at roughly $11.7 billion at recent prices. MASSIVE ETHEREUM ACCUMULATION Bitmine just went ALL IN on $ETH scooping up a total of 379,271 ETH ($1.48B) during the dip! +72,898 ETH ($281M) yesterday’s dip +104,336 ETH ($417M) 3 days ago +202,037 ETH after the weekend crash Tom Lee wasn’t joking when he said… pic.twitter.com/oiyhLO79wk — BMNR Bullz (@BMNRBullz) October 18, 2025 Based on reports, the firm has set a goal of reaching 5% of supply and only began building the treasury in early July when Ether was near $2,500. Tom Lee of Fundstrat has also been buying — he said he purchased $1.5 billion worth of Ether since the market crash — signaling that some large players see long-term upside. Questions Raised About DAT Pricing Reports say Lee warned that the hype around digital asset treasuries, or DATs, may be fading, with many DATs trading at or below their net asset value (NAV). Research firm 10x Research reported that several major DATs were near or under NAV. That has led investors to ask whether the trading discounts reflect lasting trouble or a brief market reset. Huobi founder Li Lin is reportedly raising about $1 billion to put into an Ether treasury, which shows some firms still want exposure despite the cheap trading levels. Bullish Views Meet Market Stress According to Lee, Ethereum could “flip” Bitcoin in a way he compared to how Wall Street and equities overtook gold after 1971. He also warned investors are still “licking their wounds” from a record leverage flush. Markets are down 15% from the October 7 high, while gold has eased about 3% from its peak. Those moves are shaping where big holders place their bets. Over the weekend I witnessed something every crypto investor should pay attention to. Ethereum, the largest blockchain in the world, got congested and fees skyrocketed past $1,000 just to process small transactions. That’s like paying a thousand-dollar toll to drive on a one-lane… pic.twitter.com/m9o1sRUQE0 — Kevin O’Leary aka Mr. Wonderful (@kevinolearytv) October 16, 2025 Network Strain Meanwhile, based on social posts and blockchain data, Kevin O’Leary sounded the alarm about congestion on Ethereum after fees spiked during the sell-off.

Traders are closely monitoring as both assets hold key support levels, indicating a potential short-term reversal. Analysts say the market could be in an accumulation phase with fear readings near their lowest levels in months. The Fear Index has bottomed out, often a sign of exhaustion among sellers. As sentiment starts to shift, investors are positioning for a major recovery of major assets, and selective small caps with strong fundamentals. One of them is MAGACOIN FINANCE , which continues to attract attention for its secure and utility-driven framework. Bitcoin Holds Above Key Support as Buyers Step In Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at approximately $107,000 and remains above the $105,000 support range that had been holding major rallies in the past. Buyers were active near this level, creating a stable foundation that could trigger a broader recovery. Source: CoinMarketCap The RSI is out of oversold territory, and momentum indicators are showing improvement in strength. Analysts point out that if Bitcoin stays above $105,000, the next level of appreciation is near $115,000, followed by $125,000. If it breaks below $105,000, though, the move might take prices toward $100,000 before things calm down. Despite the persistent volatility, long-term holder accumulation remains robust, indicating a positive outlook for Bitcoin in the medium term. Analysts term the current zone as a high-value zone for disciplined buyers who expect the next market upswing. Solana Faces Pressure as $175 Support Zone Becomes Critical Solana (SOL) is trading around $185, and traders are closely monitoring the $175 support level for its next move. The token continues to form lower highs from $205, indicating continued selling pressure. Failing to reclaim $182-$185 could result in downside targets near $172-$175. Source: X Large Wintermute wallet to exchange transfers have raised market caution. Similar inflows preceded the last sell-offs, and traders should be watching for more volatility. If the support fails at $175, then it is at the $165-$168 level. On the bright side, a breakout above $188-$190 would negate the bearish bias. However, institutional demand for Solana continues to remain high. Bitwise’s Solana Staking ETP (BSOL) has surpassed $100 million in AUM, showing strong long-term conviction. Analysts claim that Solana’s fundamentals are still intact despite short-term pressure. Fear Index Hits Multi-Month Low as Market Sentiment Stabilizes The Crypto Fear Index has reached its lowest level in over three months, reflecting widespread caution among retail traders. Historically, this kind of reading has coincided with market bottoms, where sentiment transitions from panic to slow accumulation. Analysts note that Bitcoin and major altcoins made significant recoveries every time the index reached comparable lows throughout previous cycles. On-chain metrics also show renewed whale accumulation and decreased outflows from major exchanges – the first signs of momentum recovery. As sentiment levels off, analysts say investors are shifting from hype to security and reliability. They believe that the next bull cycle will be in favor of audited and transparent projects. MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as one of the few early-stage tokens built around that principle, making it stand out among small-cap competitors. Recently, HashEx, a well-known blockchain security company, conducted a complete audit of the project. The audit verified that MAGACOIN FINANCE’s smart contract is secure, well-structured, and free from vulnerabilities – a key factor in attracting both retail and institutional buyers. Analysts believe that secure projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE will dominate in the next market boom , as investors prioritize safety before chasing returns. Analysts Expect Reversal as Market Finds a Floor Market strategists believe that once the Fear Index reaches its bottom, sentiment can quickly swing towards optimism. To establish strength, Bitcoin needs to hold above $105,000 and break above $115,000, while Solana needs to maintain support above $175. Accumulation trends are starting to converge between large and small-cap assets, signaling an early rebalancing for a rebound. Analysts add that projects emphasizing transparency and strong security foundations – such as MAGACOIN FINANCE, are increasingly seen as the most resilient entries for long-term investors. Conclusion The crypto market appears to be nearing the end of its fear cycle. Bitcoin and Solana are flattening out as technical strength starts to show renewed accumulation with whale activity. Analysts are forecasting a recovery period after the buyers regain control at key levels. On the other hand, investor interest in security-led growth tokens is on the rise. With its verified audit and long-term framework, MAGACOIN FINANCE embodies the kind of discipline and protection investors are now demanding. As sentiment lifts, such projects may make the next market leaders.

XRP is currently sitting at one of those critical crossroads. While many investors see red candles and uncertainty, seasoned traders are beginning to recognize a familiar setup that has historically preceded explosive growth. The latest analysis from STEPH IS CRYPTO suggests that XRP is entering an “extremely oversold” zone — a condition that, based on past performance, could mark the beginning of a powerful recovery over the next one to two months. A Familiar Pattern Emerging In his latest X post, STEPH IS CRYPTO highlighted a striking similarity between XRP’s current market structure and a previous “extremely oversold” period that triggered a 736.68% surge. On the chart, this pattern is unmistakable — RSI levels have once again plunged into deep oversold territory, mirroring the same setup that preceded XRP’s last parabolic rise. $XRP is extremely oversold. Millionaires will be made in the next 1-2 months! pic.twitter.com/ifxiipz84u — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) October 18, 2025 Historically, each time XRP reached these extreme lows on the RSI, it rebounded with exceptional force. The RSI — or Relative Strength Index — is a key momentum indicator that measures whether an asset is overbought or oversold. When it dips below 30, it signals that selling pressure may be overextended, often setting the stage for a reversal. XRP’s current RSI hovering around 34.58 suggests that a potential bottom could be forming right now. Technical Indicators Point to Imminent Reversal Beyond RSI, other technical metrics reinforce the argument for a coming rally. The market structure on the daily chart displays a steep downward exhaustion candle, followed by an increase in volume — a classic indicator of capitulation and accumulation . Traders often look for such signals to confirm that smart money is re-entering before a trend reversal. The last time XRP was this oversold, it initiated a multi-month rally that redefined investor sentiment across the crypto landscape. If history repeats, even partially, the upside potential from current levels could be significant enough to turn disciplined investors into millionaires during the next bullish swing. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 On-Chain and Market Fundamentals Align While technicals are painting a bullish picture, fundamentals are quietly reinforcing it. XRP Ledger (XRPL) activity has been on the rise, with transaction volumes, liquidity flows, and cross-border settlement integrations all trending upward. Ripple’s expanding partnerships and enterprise use cases continue to enhance confidence in XRP’s long-term value proposition, creating a foundation for sustained price momentum once the technical recovery begins. Market sentiment is also shifting. Institutional investors are reportedly increasing exposure to utility-based assets like XRP , anticipating a broader crypto market rotation toward fundamentally strong networks. These converging signals could make the coming weeks pivotal for XRP’s price trajectory. The Road Ahead STEPH IS CRYPTO’s assertion that “millionaires will be made in the next 1–2 months” may sound ambitious, but the logic is rooted in data and historical precedent. When XRP becomes extremely oversold, it tends to respond with swift and aggressive upward moves. If this pattern holds again, early participants could capture substantial gains before the broader market catches on. Still, as always in crypto, risk management remains key. Markets can stay irrational longer than expected, and oversold conditions can persist before the tide turns. But for those closely watching the charts and fundamentals align, XRP’s current setup could represent one of the most lucrative opportunities in the market’s recent history. As STEPH IS CRYPTO’s analysis suggests, the coming weeks could separate the cautious from the courageous — and potentially, the next wave of XRP millionaires from the rest.
