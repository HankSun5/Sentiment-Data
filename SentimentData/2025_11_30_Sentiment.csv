Interestingly, CryptoQuant data now reveals that spot trading volume across exchanges reached $375 billion in November. Meanwhile, exchange-traded fund (ETF) volume climbed to nearly $35 billion. Institutional Money Pours In According to the analysis, Ethereum began the year with significant volatility in monthly trading activity, with total volume fluctuating between roughly $280 billion and $380 billion before accelerating sharply in the middle of the year. That surge eventually led to a peak of more than $599 billion in August, and marked the highest monthly trading volume recorded during the period. Following this spike, trading activity eased but stayed comparatively strong, and ended November at around $375 billion, a level that indicates continued market participation despite ongoing price pressures. CryptoQuant found that Binance remained the dominant venue for Ethereum trading, and recorded approximately $198 billion in spot trading volume during November alone. This figure underscores Binance’s central role in real-time liquidity flows and its position as the leading platform for both institutional and retail traders executing high-volume transactions. Data also shows that institutional interest played a meaningful role through regulated investment vehicles, with Ethereum spot ETFs registering about $35 billion in trading volume for the month. Such a level of ETF activity points to continued engagement from traditional market participants and adds an additional layer of “organized liquidity” to overall Ethereum market flows during the period. Currently, Ethereum is seeing renewed confidence from large investors as whale activity increasingly leans toward long positions, according to Alphractal’s Whale vs Retail Delta metric. On the price front, ETH has climbed above $3,000. Despite remaining around 24% lower over the month, the asset’s recovery coincided with aggressive accumulation from major holders. As recently reported by CryptoPotato, wallets holding 10,000-100,000 ETH now control a record level of over 21 million ETH, while entities with over 100,000 ETH have expanded their balance to around 4.3 million ETH. ETH Near Neutral Zone Further analysis reveals that Ethereum is trading near fair-value territory, as important on-chain indicators point to a sensitive phase in the market. Ethereum’s Realized Price stands at $2,315 and an MVRV ratio of 1.27. This places the asset in a neutral zone where the market price sits just 27% above the Realized Price, which shows neither overbought nor oversold conditions. Binance-specific data reflects an even sharper shift, as Ethereum’s MVRV ratio on the exchange hovers near 0.999, just below the historically important threshold of 1.0. A reading under 1 means that market capitalization is aligning with the Realized Price, pushing most investors into a “no-profit, no-loss” position. This zone has historically coincided with early market bottoms or extended periods of price weakness. On the other hand, long-term MVRV readings above 3 typically correspond with overbought phases, while values below 1 indicate market troughs characterized by unrealized losses. The current ratio of 1.27 points to a balanced market structure with no strong signals of extreme valuation.

In an interview with Altcoin Daily, he argued that many newly launched networks, despite attracting early investor attention, lack sustainable fundamentals and carry inflated valuations. Hayes emphasized that initial hype often creates short-term price gains but does not guarantee enduring success for these projects. Monad and the Risks of High-Valuation L1s Hayes specifically highlighted Monad, a recently launched L1 backed by Coinbase Ventures. At the time of his statement, MON token had risen 45% since its ICO, reaching roughly $0.037 with a market capitalization near $398 million. Despite these gains, Hayes expects a dramatic decline, citing the coin’s high fully diluted valuation and low circulating supply. He noted that many new L1s follow a pattern of early surges followed by sharp corrections, driven by initial investor optimism rather than fundamental value. According to Hayes, new L1 projects often attract attention because investors hope to discover the next Ethereum. Early pumps create excitement, but most tokens fail to maintain momentum once hype fades. Venture capital support may temporarily prop up prices, but Hayes warned that this does not guarantee long-term success. Consequently, he believes most L1 tokens outside Ethereum and Solana are destined for collapse. Ethereum and Solana: The Standout Networks Despite the challenges facing newer L1s, Hayes identifies Ethereum and Solana as exceptions. He sees Ethereum as the foundation for institutional blockchain adoption. Large banks and organizations now prefer public networks over private chains due to security and utility advantages. Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism will help Ethereum scale while maintaining privacy, positioning it for sustained growth. Solana, according to Hayes, remains the second-largest L1, benefiting previously from meme coin activity. However, he acknowledges that meme-driven growth has slowed. Solana will need a new catalyst to maintain user engagement and price momentum. While Hayes remains skeptical that it will surpass Ethereum, he believes the network will continue to play a significant role in the blockchain ecosystem. Hayes’ Magnificent Five In addition to Ethereum and Solana, Hayes named Bitcoin, Zcash, and Ethena as his top cryptocurrency picks. These networks combine adoption, security, and practical utility, which he considers critical for long-term success. By contrast, most other L1 tokens face a high risk of decline as early enthusiasm fades.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|SOL|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-29 19:50:13

The momentum is gaining traction at an accelerated pace, and the preliminary indications are that this project could be among the best cryptocurrencies to follow in the coming 2026. As the demand is growing by the day, there are several traders who are worried about not getting one of the most desired early performances of the year. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building two lending markets in its protocol. P2C Lending: Under its derivative services called Peer-to-Contracts, buyers can post assets and earn mtTokens, which are equivalent to deposits for them and generate APY as borrowers use them. As an example, a person who provides $1,000 of USDC may be issued several mtUSDC, the value of which increases with the payment of interest by borrowers. The yield also depends on demand, and therefore, the more the borrowers the more the APY of the suppliers. P2P Marketplace: Mutuum Finance is also developing a Peer-to-peer marketplace and the users get to create single borrowing agreements. The rates are based on utilization and risk. Borrowers have options on whether to accept variable or in certain cases stable rates in case they want to have known costs on repaying loans. Loan to Value restrictions insure positions. The LTVs of lower-volatility investments such as the ETF remain at an average of 75%, whereas more aggressive prices remain only at 35%-40%. In case the value of collateral is low, the protocol causes the liquidation. Liquidators purchase collateral at a discount and redeem some of the debt held by the borrower, and this is to take care of system losses. Presale Progress, Funding Milestones and Demand Since it was launched in the beginning of 2025, momentum has been fast-paced at Mutuum Finance. The initial price was at $0.01 and now it is $0.035 with the price value increasing by 250%. The initial price is established as $0.06, which could imply a good increase in the price when the demand is maintained. The project has gathered a total of $19M funds and over 18,200 holders. Out of 4B supply of tokens, the presale has been allotted 45.5% which equals to 1.82B tokens. Of the same, 800M tokens are already owned. The momentum is high and Phase 6 is at the last leg with allocation standing at high above 92%. Mutuum Finance also operates a 24 hour leaderboard where the leader each day gets $500 in MUTM as a prize. This promotes the incessant use and assists in attracting new users into the system. The card payments also make participation possible in presale since buyers can immediately participate without any supplementary actions. The prelaunch crypto demand keeps gaining momentum with more and more traders seeking the most favorable crypto to purchase before launch. The window to enter at $0.035 is closing quicker than projected. V1 Check Mutuum Finance has assured using the official X account that the V1 of the protocol will launch on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. The initial one will consist of a liquidity pool, mtToken mechanisms, a debt-tracking token, and the liquidation bot. ETH and USDT will be accommodated initially. Another significant highlight is security. Mutuum Finance underwent a CertiK audit with a 90/100 Token Scan rating, with a thorough review of the lending and borrowing agreements currently being done by Halborn Security . This essay analyzes that a powerful audit, solid product roadmap, and fast presale growth, combined, might potentially put MUTM in one of the strongest early moves in 2026. According to the commentators in the market, it can further increase above $0.06 launch price in case the demand keeps rising considering the increased interest by the whale buyers. Layer-2 Expansion and Why It Matters The team is also gearing towards adding layer-2 expansion and seek to deploy on chains characterized by a lower fee and increased throughput. The reason behind this is that in cases where borrowing and lending are easy and inexpensive, DeFi platforms expand. Increased L2 coverage may also increase the number of total users and enhance liquidity. Such measures are important since users who seek to know what crypto to invest their money tend to select those projects that already display extensive planning rather than just through marketing or hype. Mutuum Finance possesses physical infrastructure in place, defined security level, and various avenues to grow upon the launching. Cash is flowing within investors and is moving fast with Phase 6 approaching a total of 100% sellout. Having increased its price by 250%, powerful DeFi mechanics, solid roadmap, large audits, plans of a layer-2, and growing purchasing force, Mutuum Finance is turning out to be among the most popular cryptocurrencies in 2026.

Monero is an attractive investment because it emphasizes privacy and security, utilizing advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure transaction confidentiality, which has created a strong demand in the market . Its growing adoption across various use cases and a decentralized development model enhance its long-term potential. With a limited supply and increasing investor interest, Monero offers a unique opportunity for those seeking financial autonomy and privacy to invest in cryptocurrency. However, investors should remain cautious of regulatory risks and market volatility when considering Monero as part of their portfolio, making it essential to seek investment advice. Why is XMR up? Monero price analysis shows that XMR saw a swift rise to the $407 mark before falling back to the $385 mark where it found support to continue the rally to the current $410 mark. Will XMR recover to its all-time high? Monero is expected to recover toward its all-time high of $518 by mid-2026 as the privacy chain continues to reduce its tech debt and progresses toward greater utility and privacy. However, the platform might have to overcome regulatory scrutiny and challenges before it can see mass adoption, as it remains highly speculative . How much will Monero be worth in 5 years? The Monero price prediction for 2030 suggests a minimum price of $1,048.76 and an average trading price of $1,142.11 . The maximum forecasted price is set at $1,208.35. Will XMR reach $1000? The chances of Monero (XMR) hitting $1,000 hinge on various factors, which will influence its future price movements. The adoption of privacy transactions and technological advances could increase demand. Favorable regulations and market sentiment toward privacy coins would also help. Yet, regulatory risks, competition, and market volatility are challenges that monero traders could face could hinder significant growth. $1,000 is possible with favorable conditions, especially considering the current price but market dynamics and regulations will shape its path. Does XMR have a good long-term future? Monero (XMR) has the potential for a strong long-term future due to its focus on privacy and security, which makes it attractive to users seeking anonymity. However, many investors have concerns regarding privacy, regulatory scrutiny, and notoriety from being the favored medium for some past criminals, which impact the current Monero sentiment. Monero’s commitment to ring confidential transactions and privacy gives it a solid foundation for long-term growth, but it must carefully navigate market and regulatory landscapes.

The highest price was $278.56, and the lowest was $114.16. In January 2024, Monero stayed stable around the $150.00 mark as market momentum remained low. However, the stability was short-lived as February crashed to $101.95. However, XMR showed swift recovery as it closed the month near the $150.00 level again. In March and April 2024, XMR saw a steady decline from $150.00 to $120.00, where it found key support. In May 2024, XMR observed steady bullish pressure as the price rose from $120.00, approaching resistance at $150.

In July, the crypto traded around the $155 mark as the price volatility remained relatively low. XMR opened trading at $156.05 in August and ended the month at $176.00, making remarkable gains. September was bearish for the asset, as the price declined below the $160 mark by the end of the month. In October, Monero observed a steep crash and has been making a swift recovery since then.

During June the price continued to observe high volatility but observed low net change as the asset closed the month around $313.

He linked gold’s long history as a neutral asset to the rise of XRP. He shared a video where gold wholesaler Chris Olson spoke on Tucker Carlson’s show. Olson discussed government control over wealth. Aljarrah explained why he views gold and XRP as aligned with personal sovereignty. He views XRP as a neutral bridge , playing a role similar to gold in the digital age. Gold is the only form of freedom that has survived every collapse. Neutral. Answers to no government. Answers to no bank. XRP is the evolution of that same principle, a neutral bridge for a digital world. If you understand sovereignty, you hold both. pic.twitter.com/gnqFn03KSF — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) November 28, 2025 A Focus on Control Olson’s remarks created a direct contrast between individual autonomy and the modern tax system. He said, “We were a free country once,” while describing the current approach to income reporting. He argued that the state views earnings as a resource to be managed rather than a private matter. His view centered on the claim that the government chooses to use the people as a source of revenue. He then pointed out how much time citizens work each year to meet their IRS obligations. He linked that burden to foreign policy spending that many taxpayers do not support. This argument fits Aljarrah’s point. The concern is not about ordinary taxation. It is about a structure that can hinder families’ ability to protect assets or build long-term stability. Olson said the system does not let families preserve and transmit generational wealth. Why Aljarrah Connects Gold and XRP While some analysts believe XRP can replicate Gold’s market performance , Aljarrah sees a deeper connection. He framed gold as a form of freedom that has survived every collapse. He described it as neutral and outside the reach of both governments and banks. He then presented XRP as the digital evolution of that idea. He described XRP as a neutral bridge suited for the global movement of value. The message linked physical and digital stores of value. The comparison reflects a view held by many XRP supporters. XRP does not grant governments the ability to freeze or reverse transactions at the protocol level. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Even Ripple has no control over XRP . It moves value across borders in seconds without relying on traditional banking rails. This structure matches the principle Olson defended in his interview. It favors systems that let individuals operate without unnecessary oversight. XRP’s Role Today Olson’s remarks on state control highlight why many view XRP as a neutral asset. XRP offers fast settlement, low cost, and clear user control. Aljarrah links it to Gold as a tool for personal autonomy. He sees XRP as a direct, sovereign option for a digital financial system. According to Aljarrah, anyone who understands sovereignty holds both gold and XRP. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Expert Answers,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/whats-going-on-behind-the-scenes-with-xrp-expert-answers/,"Conversations around XRP have grown louder in recent weeks as the cryptocurrency continues to trade around the $2.2 region while new Spot XRP ETFs continue to attract inflows across multiple issuers. One voice in the community has attempted to explain why the market is unusually calm despite rising institutional demand. An XRP enthusiast known as Pumpius shared a detailed thread on X that breaks down the mechanics behind the new ETFs and why the real impact may still be ahead. His argument is that the current XRP price action does not yet reflect what is going on behind the scenes. Related Reading: Bitcoin Maxi Says ATH Back On The Table After 40x Derivatives Surge Why ETF Rules Create A Special Market Dynamic Pumpius explained that the foundation of the entire setup is in one legal detail with fund managers. ETF fund managers are restricted from purchasing XRP directly from Ripple or from the escrow accounts that hold large reserves of the token. Every ETF must source XRP through open-market purchases, without private deals or wholesale arrangements. The absence of direct acquisition forces institutional buyers into the same liquidity pool as retail and whales. With the new launch of XRP ETFs, and as demand continues to rise, the circulating supply is now the battleground, and this mechanical pressure is already visible in recent weeks as XRP trading volumes climbed while exchange supply began trending downward. According to market trackers, XRP supply on major exchanges has declined steadily since the approval of the first Spot XRP ETFs, showing that the stress on available liquidity is not theoretical but active. Particularly, data from CryptoQuant shows that Binance’s XRP reserves are now at their lowest point in months, having dropped to 2.7 billion tokens this week. Incoming Supply Squeeze For XRP Another part of the explanation focuses on Ripple’s behavior regarding escrow releases. Although one billion XRP is unlocked each month, Ripple has repeatedly returned about 700 million to 800 million of these unlocked tokens back into escrow. Ripple releases only what it considers necessary to maintain healthy liquidity in the ecosystem, and the company has avoided significant selling pressure since the ETF approvals. According to Pumpius, this means the ecosystem is operating in a controlled balance where ETF issuers are absorbing a growing share of the circulating float, while Ripple keeps escrow output extremely conservative. The result is a slow tightening of supply that’s happening behind the scenes and may not yet be visible in price action but can eventually cause what he called a structural supply shock. When this happens, XRP will not move slowly, but it will break price levels with impact.

Its iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) recorded significant outflows in the week from November 21 to November 28, 2025, totaling $113.70 million. On November 21, the ETF saw an outflow of $122 million, followed by another $149.1 million on November 22. The next two days brought some relief, with inflows of $83 million on November 23 and $61.5 million on November 24. However, this brief recovery was overshadowed by a sharp outflow on November 25, pushing the total net outflow for the week to $113.7 million. Despite the mix of inflows and outflows, the net negative movement remains a red flag. After outflows of $271.1 million in the first two days, the inflows that followed were not enough to offset the heavy losses. Bitcoin ETFs inflows. Source: Coinglass Indeed, the outflows are likely to add more pressure to Bitcoin’s price, which is struggling to maintain the $90,000 support zone. Even so, on-chain data suggests the asset may see sustained gains in the coming days. Bitcoin shows signs of market bottom In this case, data shared by Ali Martinez in a November 29 X post shows Bitcoin nearing a key “low-risk” zone based on its Sharpe Ratio, a measure of risk-adjusted returns. Historically, when this ratio dips into the green band, it has coincided with discounted prices and strong accumulation periods for long-term investors .

This is an area that often offers solid opportunities for dip buyers. pic.twitter.com/0XAMkFKrTP — Ali (@ali_charts) November 29, 2025 The latest data indicates a sharp drop in the Sharpe Ratio, mirroring past cycles that preceded major recoveries. Bitcoin’s price has also softened, pulling back from recent highs and approaching levels that typically attract dip buyers. While the indicator doesn’t guarantee a market bottom, its move toward the low-risk zone has often signaled favorable long-term entry points as sentiment cools and risk metrics reset.

While the project is seeing massive institutional interest, with ETF inflows topping $527 million , its price is struggling to break past key resistance around the $144 mark. Now, a new proposal to cut staking rewards is raising questions about its long-term decentralization. GeeFi has set a new benchmark for early-stage momentum after selling 10 million tokens and fully closing Phase 1 in a little over a week . Thousands of investors moved in fast, recognizing the potential behind GeeFi’s advanced, utility-packed DeFi wallet. Phase 2 has already begun with a 20% price uplift , and analysts expect this phase to wrap up rapidly, given the intense demand. Immediately after Phase 3 fills, the price jumps another 20% , meaning every delay costs potential upside. GeeFi’s Clear Path GeeFi offers a solution by focusing on a self-sustaining ecosystem that rewards its users directly. With its non-custodial wallet , you maintain full control over your assets. GeeFi is building a platform where you can earn through clear and tangible methods. Its upcoming staking program, for example, is projected to offer an impressive APR of up to 55% . This provides a dependable source of passive income that isn’t reliant on speculative market trends or institutional sentiment. A Presale Opportunity with Explosive Momentum The excitement around GeeFi is growing rapidly. The project sold all 10 million of its Phase 1 tokens, raising $500,000 in just 12 days . An incredible $320,000 of that was raised in the last week alone, showing a massive acceleration in demand. Now in Phase 2, the GEE token is priced at $0.06 , but the opportunity for huge returns remains. With a listing price of $0.40 already planned, investors who buy now are looking at a guaranteed return of 667% . Analysts are forecasting that GeeFi could become a $2 project. This means a $600 investment today could turn into $20,000 , delivering a remarkable 3,233% ROI . Given the rapid pace of Phase 1, experts predict Phase 3 could begin in just 3 weeks , so the window to get in at this price is closing fast. Your All-in-One Hub for Crypto Management GeeFi is creating an integrated platform to make every part of your crypto experience easier. The GeeFi HUB will serve as a central command center for managing all your digital assets. It will connect directly with the GeeFi DEX , a decentralized exchange designed for fast, secure, and low-cost trading across multiple blockchains. This design directly addresses the common frustrations of high fees and complicated interfaces found on many other platforms. With the GeeFi HUB and DEX, you can manage your portfolio, keep track of your NFTs, and swap tokens without any hassle. It is a full suite of tools built to give you more power and control, making crypto management both direct and affordable. An Ecosystem Built to Reward Its Community At the core of the project is the GeeFi Wallet , which is already available for Android , with an iOS version coming soon. It supports over 14 networks , letting you manage all of your crypto assets in one secure and convenient location. The GeeFi Team has been working on this platform since 2023 , providing consistent updates that demonstrate their commitment to a long-term vision. GeeFi also rewards its community for helping it expand. Through a simple referral program, you can earn a 5% bonus in GEE tokens for every purchase made with your unique link. While Solana’s future depends on unpredictable market forces, GeeFi is building a project with real utility and sharing its success with its supporters from the very beginning. With excitement growing and investors pouring in, the presale is transforming into a race rather than an opportunity. Those who wait too long may find themselves chasing a price that keeps moving higher.

Nearly every top platform reported massive outflows, signaling potential shifts in user behavior and institutional strategies. Analysts note that the total XRP held on exchanges has fallen sharply, suggesting either large-scale withdrawals, migration to self-custody, or internal rebalancing. The total exchange-held XRP dropped to 15.86 billion, a decline of 6.5 billion XRP since February, representing a 29% decrease. Upbit experienced a 6.22 billion XRP outflow, while Binance saw 2.56 billion XRP leave the platform. Bithumb followed with 1.77 billion XRP withdrawn. Other major exchanges, including Uphold, eToro, Bybit, and Bitbank, reported roughly 50% balance drops. These figures suggest that users are increasingly moving assets off exchanges, possibly into personal wallets or cold storage solutions. Meanwhile, a few platforms bucked the trend, Evernorth gained 13.36%, Coincheck saw an influx of 550 million XRP, and OKX reported a striking 10,107% spike, likely due to address reclassification. Conversely, some exchanges faced extreme declines. Coinbase lost 99.97% of its XRP holdings since February, while KuCoin, Paribu, and SwissBorg recorded near-total exits. The widespread reduction in exchange balances highlights a possible reshuffling event that could have long-term implications for XRP liquidity and market dynamics. 21Shares XRP ETF Set to Trade on Monday This liquidity shift coincides with the upcoming launch of the 21Shares U.S. spot XRP ETF, set to trade under the ticker TOXR on Monday. The ETF will track the CME CF XRP-Dollar Reference Rate, allowing investors exposure to XRP’s spot price without holding the cryptocurrency directly. The U.S. market has seen a flurry of XRP ETF activity in recent days, including launches from Grayscale and Franklin Templeton. Early trading of these ETFs shows strong demand, with GXRP and XRPZ capturing $67.36 million and $62.59 million in flows on their first days, respectively. Technical Outlook: Key Levels to Watch Source: X As of press time, XRP’s price rose 0.75% in the last 24 hours, trading at $2.19 , with a 7-day gain of 13.61% and a market cap of $132 billion. According to EGRAG CRYPTO analysis, closing above $2.60 could signal bullish momentum, while surpassing $3.40 would indicate strong upward trends. Conversely, a close below the 21 EMA may mark a bearish reversal. Analysts emphasize monitoring these levels for signs of sustained market strength. Conclusion XRP’s recent exchange outflows, combined with the launch of the 21Shares ETF, indicate a transformative period for liquidity and investor behavior.

This unprecedented surge in digital commerce represents a 9% increase from last year’s $10.8 billion, signaling that Black Friday has firmly established itself as a dominant e-commerce moment. How Did Black Friday Online Spending Reach Record Levels? The numbers tell a compelling story of digital transformation. Between 10am and 2pm on Black Friday, online shoppers were spending an incredible $12.5 million every minute. Adobe Analytics, which tracks more than 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail websites, confirmed this represents a new benchmark for holiday shopping. The data reveals that consumers are increasingly opting to shop from home rather than brave crowded stores, fundamentally changing how Americans approach the biggest shopping day of the year. What Do These Holiday Shopping Trends Reveal About Consumer Behavior? The record-breaking Black Friday performance provides crucial insights into broader holiday shopping patterns. Adobe projects total holiday spending will reach $253.4 billion this year, up from $241.1 billion in 2024. However, the growth story has important nuances: Salesforce tracked $79 billion in global Black Friday spending, with $18 billion coming from the United States Year-over-year increases of 6% globally and 3% in the U.S. Higher prices accounted for much of the growth, with prices up 7% on average Actual order volumes decreased by 1%, suggesting consumers are spending more per item How Is E-commerce Evolving During Peak Shopping Seasons? The e-commerce landscape is undergoing rapid transformation, with Cyber Monday expected to surpass even Black Friday’s impressive numbers. According to Reuters, Adobe projects $14.2 billion in online spending for Cyber Monday, continuing the trend of digital dominance during the holiday season. This represents a significant shift from traditional brick-and-mortar shopping, though the data on in-store traffic presents a mixed picture: Data Source In-Store Traffic Change Key Findings RetailNext Down 3.4% nationwide Overall decline in physical store visits Pass_by Up 1.17% overall Department stores saw 7.9% increase The Rising Impact of AI Shopping on Holiday Commerce Both Adobe and Salesforce report seeing growing AI influence on holiday shopping behavior. Salesforce revealed that between Thanksgiving and Black Friday, AI and AI agents influenced $22 billion in global sales. While the exact definition of “AI influence” remains somewhat unclear, this represents a significant development in how technology is shaping consumer decisions and shopping patterns. The integration of AI into e-commerce platforms is creating more personalized shopping experiences, helping consumers find deals faster and making recommendations based on browsing behavior and purchase history. This technological advancement is likely contributing to the efficiency of online shopping and the record-breaking spending numbers. What Does This Mean for the Future of Retail? The record Black Friday online spending of $11.8 billion signals a permanent shift in consumer behavior. Several key trends are emerging: Digital Dominance: Online shopping continues to capture larger shares of holiday spending Price Sensitivity: Higher prices are driving dollar growth while volume decreases AI Integration: Artificial intelligence is becoming a significant factor in shopping decisions Timing Matters: Peak shopping hours generate massive concentrated spending The transformation of Black Friday from a primarily in-store event to a major e-commerce moment reflects broader changes in retail. As consumers become more comfortable with digital shopping and technology continues to evolve, we can expect these trends to accelerate in coming years. Frequently Asked Questions How does Adobe Analytics track online spending data? Adobe Analytics monitors more than 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail websites, providing comprehensive insights into e-commerce trends and consumer behavior across the digital shopping landscape. What companies provide holiday shopping data beyond Adobe? Salesforce also tracks global shopping trends, reporting $79 billion in worldwide Black Friday spending with detailed analysis of price changes and order volumes across different markets and retail sectors. How is AI influencing holiday shopping according to the data? Salesforce data indicates that AI and AI agents influenced approximately $22 billion in global sales between Thanksgiving and Black Friday, though the specific mechanisms and definitions of AI influence continue to evolve as the technology becomes more integrated into e-commerce platforms. What’s the difference between Black Friday and Cyber Monday projections? While Black Friday set a record at $11.8 billion, Adobe projects Cyber Monday will reach $14.2 billion in online spending, reflecting the continued growth of digital commerce and changing consumer shopping patterns throughout the holiday weekend. How do in-store shopping trends compare to online growth? Data from RetailNext shows a 3.4% decline in nationwide in-store traffic, while Pass_by reports a 1.17% overall increase with department stores seeing a significant 7.9% boost, indicating varied performance across different retail formats and locations.

55115942,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=869944,1764453600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/55115942.jpeg,"The New Crypto Dominating Q4 2025, Only 6% Tokens Under $0.04 Remain",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/the-new-crypto-dominating-q4-2025-only-6-tokens-under-0-04-remain/,"It is being overtaken by a new cryptocurrency in the last quarter of 2025 and the demand is increasing at a faster rate than many had anticipated. As 6% of its existing token issue remains outstanding at less than half a $0.08, investors are scrambling to lay hands on their positions before the next crypto market leap. The pace is picking up day by day and it is prematurely believed that this project can be the best one to purchase currently as more and more interest is generated in the market. Explosive Presale at Mutuum Finance One of the best presales of the year has been by Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . When the presale was opened in early 2025, the token was priced at $0.01. It now costs $0.035, which is a 250% increase in token appreciation. The rise has been gradual and not abrupt as perceived by many traders. The presale occupies 1.82 billion tokens (45.5%) of the total supply of 4B. Over 800 million tokens have already been sold. Mutuum Finance has already raised over $19M and has over 18,200 holders, which makes it one of the most active new cryptocurrency offerings in 2025. Phase 6 is in the final stages, and it is already allocated over 94%, and only a minor percentage of tokens is left at the current price. The high demand rate is one of the reasons why investors seeking the best cryptocurrency to invest today are putting MUTM under their watch. Mutuum Finance and What It Is Building Mutuum Finance is developing a flexible and yield-efficient protocol of lending and borrowing, which is decentralised. The system aims at providing users with greater liquidity control and allowing a safer way of borrowing and more predictable returns. The central concept of the platform is the use of mtTokens, with which users are rewarded when they post assets to the protocol. These tokens increase in value as the borrowers repay interest, which is comparable to the yield bearing receipt of deposits. The design assists in making the interests of the suppliers and the borrowers to match without the use of basic staking rewards. A buy-and-distribute model also helps Long-term value at Mutuum Finance. A part of the protocol revenue is used to buy MUTM on the open market, and MUTM on the open market is redistributed to users that stake mtTokens in the safety module. This provides pressure to purchase continuously and compensate the active users as the platform increases. The issue of security has been a primary interest since the beginning. The project underwent a CertiK audit where the score was 90/100 Token Scan and Halborn Security is looking into lending and borrowing contracts. Having already finalized code, this stage of transparency gives comfort to the early investors and contributes to the development of trust concerning the long-term perspectives of the project. V1 Launch, Whale Activity and Increasing Urgency As indicated in the official account of Mutuum Finance V1 protocol, the release of the protocol is set on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. The initial version will consist of a working liquidity pool, mtTokens, a debt-tracking token, and the liquidation bot. There will be support of ETH and USDT at the launch. The existence of a working protocol in the presence of the token lists enhances the likelihood of the existence of an early exchange visibility, which may become a trigger to more interest and a purchasing triumph. It has been observed that the activities of the whale are on the increase with Phase 6 nearing its end. There are recent significant allocations such as buys of more than $100K which indicate that there is a lot of confidence in this project on its long-term vision. When large investors join in the last phases of a presale, it is usually an indication of active demand. The number of tokens below $0.04 is shrinking at a 6% rate, and there is always a sense of urgency. Investors who seek the best cryptocurrency to invest in at the moment are fast mounting their horses as the countenance at $0.035 narrows by day. As soon as Phase 6 is fully allocated, the following step will increase the entry price, and there will be no likelihood to purchase MUTM lower than $0.04. Supported by a booming presale, robust security bases, plans to launch stablecoins, oracle infrastructure, whales and an almost full Phase 6, Mutuum Finance now applies to Q4 2025. The early investors have only a meager percentage of tokens remaining at 0.035 and the clock is running out on them. The supply will dwindle at any time as long as the demand remains at this rate.

The flagship cryptocurrency is now trading above $90,000, with hopes building for a potential push back toward its all-time high of $126,100. Notably, popular market analyst KillaXBT has flagged a key price zone that could serve as the next target in this relieving market recovery. Related Reading: Bitcoin Must Break Key Supply Clusters To Regain ATH Momentum – Watch These Levels Bitcoin Headed To $95k-$96k, But Price Pullback May Occur First – Analyst In an X post on November 28, KillaXBT shares some compelling insights on Bitcoin’s price condition, highlighting both bullish and bearish tendencies. Following the asset’s gain of 7.22% in the past week, the analyst predicts that market bulls are likely to drive prices to around $95,000-$96,000, which contains strong, heavy illiquidity pockets and several liquidation clusters. For context, these zones are attractive to price because they contain large concentrations of resting orders, making them high-value liquidity targets. Liquidation clusters, in particular, hold groups of leveraged positions that trigger forced buying or selling once the price reaches them, injecting fresh liquidity into the market. However, KillaXBT cautions that this upside move may not occur immediately, noting that the market often delays sweeping major liquidity zones ahead of key macro events. With the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting expected to deliver clarity on potential rate cuts, traders may see continued liquidity building below the yearly open in the near term. According to the analyst, these upper liquidation levels are still likely to be cleared, but the timing could align more closely with next month’s policy announcement rather than the current market cycle. The analyst outlines a potential scenario in which Bitcoin experiences a minor pullback to around $93,000 before retesting $89,200. From there, the asset could move toward the $95,000–$96,000 target, in line with expectations for a potential FOMC rate adjustment. However, KillaXBT also highlights the possibility that Bitcoin may reach these key liquidation zones before the FOMC meeting. In such a scenario, the market could see a rapid surge to $96,000, followed by a sharp drop to around $89,200 due to potential liquidations, before eventually returning to these upper liquidity zones. Following this analysis, KillaXBT is opting for a short position, which he intends to reassess in relation to market trends as the FOMC approaches. Interestingly, the analyst believes the real short-term opportunity only comes after the FOMC’s announcement. Related Reading: Bitcoin STH Loss Transfers Fall 80% From Peak – What Comes Next?

According to the organization, these criminal hubs often lure victims with promises of high-paying overseas jobs before coercing them into compounds where they are forced to carry out schemes ranging from voice phishing and romance scams to investment fraud and cryptocurrency fraud targeting individuals worldwide. While not everyone working in these centres is trafficked, Interpol noted that those held against their will frequently face brutal conditions, including physical violence, torture, sexual exploitation, and rape. Global Crisis The resolution comes amidst growing use of advanced technologies by criminal networks to deceive victims and conceal their operations. As part of a coordinated plan for joint action, Interpol has outlined several measures to strengthen international law enforcement efforts, including real-time intelligence sharing to identify perpetrators and pinpoint locations, multinational joint operations supported by Interpol, targeted action against criminal financing and illicit assets linked to scam networks, and standardized emergency protocols to rescue and repatriate victims alongside expanded support services. Interpol Secretary General Valdecy Urquiza said , “To effectively counter these criminal networks, we must strengthen collaboration, improve information sharing, and move forward with coordinated, decisive action. INTERPOL is committed to supporting the resolution’s implementation and working with member countries to break these operations apart and protect the people who are most at risk.” The resolution also calls for global awareness campaigns directed at vulnerable groups, particularly youth and job seekers. Interpol said the threat has grown sharply, while pointing to its June crime trend update that reveals victims from more than 60 countries have been trafficked into scam centres operating well beyond Southeast Asia. Criminal activities have been found to be increasingly overlapping with drug, firearms, and wildlife trafficking. In 2024, Interpol led its largest-ever global operation against trafficking-driven fraud across 116 countries and territories, which resulted in more than 2,500 arrests, alongside additional regional operations in Africa and Europe. The organization first drew attention to the rise of scam centres in 2022 with a Purple Notice warning of social media recruitment tactics, followed by a 2023 Orange Notice which identified trafficking-fuelled fraud as a serious and imminent threat to public safety. Interpol Targets Big Names in Crypto Crime The resolution emerges as Interpol continues to pursue several high-profile individuals tied to alleged crypto-related crimes around the world. For instance, in 2022, the organization issued a Red Notice for Terraform Labs co-founder and CEO Do Kwon following the collapse of the Terra ecosystem. In July 2024, Hong Kong native and cryptocurrency promoter Wong Ching-kit was added to Interpol’s alert system for his suspected involvement in multiple criminal cases, including a cryptocurrency scam of more than $384,310. And in December 2024, Richard Schueler, better known as Richard Heart, founder of the Hex cryptocurrency, was listed under a Red Notice at the request of Finnish authorities over allegations of tax fraud and assault.

Fresh market data reveals that buying and selling pressure is no longer evenly distributed throughout the day, with the United States emerging as the key source of support. At the same time, other regions struggle to regain a solid footing. US Traders Fuel Bitcoin, Ethereum, And XRP Price Recovery Bitcoin’s market has moved once again as fresh on-chain data shows a clear divide in buying and seeking across global trading hours. A recent shift in US trading activity has had a noticeable impact on the broader crypto market. Ethereum and XRP, which experienced a sharp decline in previous weeks, have begun to stabilize and show mild recovery as Bitcoin strengthens during US hours. Currently, the price of BTC is above $90,000 after crashing below $87,000 earlier in the week. Ethereum has also reclaimed the $3,000 level and is now trading steadily above it. XRP has recorded the most weekly increase between the two, jumping approximately 14% according to CoinMarketCap, with its price presently around $2.18. While these cryptocurrencies have yet to regain all lost ground, renewed buying from US traders has helped ease the downward momentum that dominated in previous weeks. Sharing a new session-based chart from Velo, market analyst Ted Pillows disclosed that the US has reemerged as a net buyer of Bitcoin. At the same time, Asia remains the primary source of selling pressure throughout the year. This regional imbalance has reshaped the latest price movements of Ethereum and XRP, which tend to follow Bitcoin’s upward trajectory . The latest figures from Velo support this view. Velo’s Bitcoin session chart shows that US trading hours, which had been in negative territory earlier in the week, climbed steadily into positive territory from November 24 to date. The blue line representing US hours rose from just above 2% to 3.73% on November 24 before reaching 7.55% by November 26. This reflects a gain of more than 4% over the period, confirming a strong resurgence in demand from US traders. Europe Remains Uneven While Asia Leads Bitcoin Selling European trading hours, highlighted by the purple line, have been more uneven than those of the US. Europe rose to 1.67% on November 24 and briefly pushed higher to 3.31% later that day. This surge comes after the cumulative weekly return fell into negative territory from November 21, and while a slight recovery followed, it still ended the week below the flat line. This suggests that despite weak buying momentum, Europe may no longer be delivering the heavy selling pressure seen earlier. On the other hand, Asia continues to lag behind both regions. Velo’s chart shows that the APAC trading session , represented by the yellow line, started in slightly positive territory around November 20 but turned negative soon after. For most of the week, the regions remained between -5% and -7%. This persistent weakness signals a continuation of the year-long pattern in which Asian hours have been the leading driver of Bitcoin’s sell-side pressure.

The premier cryptocurrency seems to be on a recovery path, returning above the $90,000 mark on Wednesday, November 26. Despite the several calls of the bear market in recent weeks, the crowd has returned with hopes of the BTC bull run resuming. However, a prominent on-chain analyst has come forward with an interesting analysis of the current Bitcoin price outlook. BTC Price To Continue Within $70,000 – $90,000 Zone: Analyst In a November 28 post on the X platform, CryptoOnchain shared an evaluation of Bitcoin’s current price action around the $90,000 level. According to the crypto pundit, recent on-chain data suggests that the market leader is at risk of a rejection at its current price level. Related Reading: Fed To End QT In December: Will Bitcoin Mirror The Massive Price Crash From Last Time? CryptoOnchain highlighted that the Bitcoin price lost a significant support level at $90,000 when it initially fell to around the $80,000 mark a week ago. Now, the price of BTC is looking to make a sustained close above the $90,000 level after bouncing back from the Point of Control (POC) near $82,000. In crypto trading, the point of control (POC) refers to the price level with the highest volume of trading activity within a given period. It basically represents a zone where buyers and sellers are equally matched, leading to the formation of support or resistance. After bouncing from the POC around $82,000, CryptoOnchain said the flagship cryptocurrency has now settled into a “clear” consolidation zone between the $70,000 and $90,000 region. While the Bitcoin price currently sits above $90,000, the analyst noted that the market leader faces potential rejection. This conclusion was drawn from on-chain data, which shows that large amounts of Bitcoin have been flowing into Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume. According to CryptoQuant, the crypto exchange has seen over $2 billion worth of BTC in the past seven days, which could put some downward pressure on the price. Besides the potential selling pressure, there is limited buying power to absorb the extra BTC supply that might hit the open market from sales. CryptoOnchain shared that the net stablecoin inflow on Binance stands at approximately $735 million, which means limited potential demand or buying power. With this “clear supply-demand imbalance,” CryptoOnchain concluded that a rejection from the $90,000 mark and sideways movement within the $70,000 – $90,000 consolidation zone is the likely scenario for the price of BTC. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC sits just above $91,000, reflecting no significant movement in the past day.

55119988,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=870293,1764460793,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/55119988.jpeg,"160 New Yorkers get $12,000 in USDC as Coinbase's crypto‑UBI pilot begins",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/160-new-yorkers-12000-crypto-usdc-coinbase/,"160 people in New York City are now receiving $12,000 each in crypto through a five‑month cash transfer program funded with money that came from Coinbase. The funds did not come directly from the exchange this year. Coinbase donated the money to a nonprofit after shutting down its own philanthropy program two years ago, and that nonprofit is now running the pilot. The payments are going out in USDC, a stablecoin that tracks the U.S. dollar. The goal is simple on paper. Move real money to real people using crypto rails and track what happens. The program started in September and will end in February. Each of the 160 participants began receiving $800 per month in USDC at the start of the pilot. On top of those monthly payments, every participant also received a one‑time $8,000 lump sum in November.When the five months are finished, each person will have collected exactly $12,000. All transfers are delivered digitally through crypto wallets using USDC as the payment rail. New York pilot sends cash as monthly USDC and a large lump sum The cash transfer trial follows the model of guaranteed basic income programs that already exist across the United States and in other countries.These programs send money directly to people with no spending rules attached. The payments go to a selected group, not the entire population. Most guaranteed income programs target households that earn close to the poverty line. This makes them different from universal basic income, where everyone in a city or country would receive payments no matter their income level. The New York crypto pilot changed the usual payment pattern by adding a large upfront payment. Emma Kelsey, the program lead for the New York cash transfer project, told Business Insider that the choice to include a lump sum came from past research. “A lot of the research in our international work and in the US has shown that a lump sum could allow people to invest or do things that might have higher costs, like a security deposit or sign up for an education or training program,” she said. “But, also, it’s something that we’ve heard from participants is a preference.” Kelsey also pointed to a separate program in Georgia called In Her Hands, which is run by GiveDirectly.That project also tested larger upfront payments instead of only sending monthly transfers. “We did a lot of community research and heard from them that this lump sum approach could be more valuable for them versus a standard recurring payment model,” she said. The New York pilot copied that structure by pairing steady monthly USDC with one large payout. GiveDirectly selects South Bronx and East Harlem for crypto payments GiveDirectly chose to run the pilot in New York City for several reasons.According to Kelsey, one factor was support from local politicians for crypto‑based tools.Another factor was the level of need in the target neighborhoods. The 160 participants were selected from the South Bronx and East Harlem, two areas with very low household income levels. “We chose New York, in particular the South Bronx and East Harlem, because there are incredibly low‑income areas,” she said. “There has also been support from politicians in the area around crypto, making it accessible. It seems like a really natural fit where the need was high, but also the ecosystem around crypto had more support than in some other areas.” The decision to use crypto instead of regular bank transfers also sets this pilot apart from most other guaranteed income tests. Kelsey said GiveDirectly wants to see how people react when money arrives through digital wallets instead of bank accounts. “We are really interested to see if people use it differently,” she said. “Do they perceive it differently? Is it more or less useful to them?” Kelsey also said residents in the South Bronx and East Harlem may be more open to using crypto than traditional banking tools.She said some residents already face limits with standard financial services. “We thought it would be a good opportunity to see if this type of payment modality would be viewed favorably,” she said. The pilot will continue sending $800 each month through February, after the November lump sum already landed in wallets.

This happened during a week when the major U.S. stock averages still managed to finish higher, even as November as a whole dragged. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.5% for the month, snapping a seven‑month winning streak, while the S&P 500 and the 30‑stock Dow barely held onto small gains as pressure built across big technology names over high valuations and real questions around when massive AI spending will finally turn into steady profits. Using the CNBC Pro stock screener, analysts filtered for companies inside the S&P 500 that rallied this week while also posting an RSI above 70, and that screen pulled up only a handful of names. Alphabet and Ralph Lauren landed near the front of that group. The metric flags stocks that have run too hard in a short time and may be set for near‑term pullbacks even when broader markets look calm. Alphabet draws buyers as Gemini 3 fuels the latest rally The move in Alphabet came as investors rushed into the stock after growing doubts around OpenAI’s funding model and renewed questions about the strength of ChatGPT after the ChatGPT‑5 release in August failed to impress. Traders focused instead on Gemini 3 and the company’s in‑house Tensor Processing Units, both of which pushed shares sharply higher this week. The stock’s rise over the past year has also been visible on its one‑year performance chart as money continued to rotate into select AI names. Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes addressed the run in a client note on Nov. 24. Ben wrote, “Some investors are petrified that Alphabet will win the AI war due to huge improvements in its Gemini AI model and ongoing benefits from its custom TPU chip.” He added , “Gemini 3 should help the highly profitable API business and arguably vaults GOOGL ahead in agents … the benefits of Gemini 3 are being deployed immediately to help Search within AI Mode, which also helps alleviate concerns in the core business.” The quotes landed as the stock pushed deeper into technically stretched levels. Merck and retail names join the overbought list Merck also landed on the overbought screen with a 14‑day RSI of 80, the highest reading among the group. The drugmaker reported third‑quarter earnings and revenue above expectations in late October, driven by strong demand for its cancer immunotherapy Keytruda. Around the same time, Merck narrowed its full‑year profit outlook after lowering estimated tariff costs and adjusting for other items. On Nov. 14, the company announced plans to acquire Cidara Therapeutics in a nearly $9.2 billion deal to secure access to an experimental flu drug. After the rally, Merck shares climbed more than 21% in November, and analysts now see limited upside. Their consensus price target of $102.43 implies about 2% downside, based on market tracking from LSEG. Ralph Lauren and Las Vegas Sands rounded out the rest of the overbought group. Ralph Lauren’s RSI sits at 71, while Las Vegas Sands stands at 79.8. Ralph Lauren shares jumped 8% this week, lifting the stock to a November gain of roughly 15.5%. The rally followed a strong second‑quarter performance and guidance, which pushed analysts at TD Cowen and Telsey Advisory Group to raise their price targets earlier this month. All of the stocks on the list share the same warning light right now. They posted fast gains in a market already uneasy about stretched prices, slowing momentum in tech, and the long road ahead for turning AI investment into steady cash flows, according to the same market screen that flagged each of them this week.

As the momentum continues to increase and with high development progress already being registered, many traders deem that this token is one of the potential best tokens to buy now before it comes nearer to launching. There are indicators that the period of the greatest growth can be yet to come. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol that is aimed at developing utility. Included in the system is a Peer-to-Contract architecture whereby the users deposit assets and earn mtTokens. These mtTokens are increasing in value in accordance with the interest of the borrowers, which is an APY that is directly dependent on activity in the protocol. Another developing market is Peer to Peer. Depending on how they want to repay the loan, Borrower is given the option of using the variable and stable rates. Variable rates move with the use of the pool, whereas stable rates permit costs that may be predicted. LTV rules ensure safety. Stable assets are able to support higher LTVs, approximately 75% whereas volatile tokens are able to be near 35%t or 40%. In case of a collapse in the collateral, liquidations safeguard the pool by handing liquidators discounted collateral and liquidating risky positions. Holder Development and Increasing Demand Mutuum Finance started its journey at the beginning of 2025 at approximately $0.01. This has been followed by steady purchasing which has paved the way to a price of $0.035, an increment of 250%. The project has raised $19M on the board of investors and has established a number of 18,200 owners. All the stages have been driven by high demand. Phase 6 is currently deep into its allocation, so there is little of the tokens at the current price. Increase in presale activity is a typical indication of good market sentiment as indicated by analysts. The initial launch price of MUTM will be at $0.06, which could place early investors at an advantage to over 500% token appreciation. Mutuum Finance also has close community presence through its 24-hour leaderboard in which the best player wins $500 in MUTM. This will assist in attracting daily inflow and hastens total demand. It is the low price, combined with solid investments and increasing activity that lead many traders to believe that MUTM is one of the potential best cryptocurrencies with the price below $0.05. V1 Launch and Major Audits Based on the official X account of the project, V1 of Mutuum Finance is planned to be released on the Sepolia Testnet in the fourth quarter of 2025. This edition comprises the liquidity pool, the mtToken system, the debt-tracking token and the liquidation bot with ETH and USDT support available as soon as it is usable. It gives Mutuum Finance a great edge over many new DeFi tokens because it has a working product before it launches. One of the strongest areas of the project is security. The CertiK audit of the code was with a 90/100 Token Scan and the final version of the lending and borrowing contracts are in the review with Halborn Security . Such stacks of checks give MUTM some degree of trust that a token at an early stage may not have. Due to these reasons, analysts are confident that MUTM will be increasing amidst a great margin once it attains its launch price of $0.06. Other estimates suggest early goals of between $0.25 and $0.40 based on market volume, platform usage and general DeFi usage. According to many investors, Mutuum Finance is one of the most robust DeFi competitors with a valuation under $0.04, developing lending solutions, robust audits, yield system, layer 2 growth and stablecoin plans. The allocation of Phase 6 is almost complete and the supply is depleting rapidly, which means that the sense of urgency is gaining momentum. To the investors who are seeking the most feasible cryptocurrency to purchase, the chances of purchasing MUTM at $0.035 would not last long.

With a deeper corrective target on the macro frame and a respected support zone in the mid-range, SOL is gearing up for a move that could shape its next major trend. This Wave Completed As Solana Signals A Larger Pullback Elliott Waves Academy has presented a fresh perspective on SOL, focusing on the weekly timeframe. According to the analysis, SOL appears to have completed its upward wave, identified as wave (1)/(A), within a broader bullish structure. This recent break below a key level reinforces the view that a deeper corrective phase may already be underway. Related Reading: Solana Reclaims Crucial Resistance Despite First SOL ETF Outflows – 25% Rally Ahead? Based on the wave count and Fibonacci measurements, the correction is expected to extend toward the $49.26–$32.03 range, which aligns with the 50%–61.8% retracement levels. Should SOL reach this area, a clear corrective pattern paired with a strong bounce would help validate the broader bullish thesis and suggest that buyers are stepping back in with conviction. Price behavior within this zone will be critical in determining the next major swing. If this scenario unfolds as anticipated, a decisive breakout above the key level that was previously broken will act as confirmation for renewed upside momentum. However, a violation of the $8.00 level would invalidate the bullish outlook entirely, signaling a much deeper structural shift. SOL Coils For Impact As Price Compresses Into A Tightening Structure According to a recent update from CryptoPulse, Solana is shaping up for what looks like a textbook technical setup. The current structure is tightening, showing reduced volatility and signaling that a decisive move may be approaching. With SOL consolidating, the chart is beginning to align with a major technical level. Related Reading: Solana Pullback Finds Purpose As Strong Hands Eye Accumulation Below $160 The key zone highlighted is the $133 support level, an area that has previously acted as a reliable reaction point for buyers. Real partnerships, continuous development, and increasing on-chain activity are all reinforcing this technical zone with additional weight. Given this confluence, the strategy becomes clearer: allow price to revisit the $133 region and observe how the market responds. If buyers step in aggressively, forming wicks, bullish engulfing candles, or strong volume spikes, it could signal that the level is holding once again. CryptoPulse emphasizes patience above all. Instead of chasing the market, let the chart come to you. When both fundamentals and technicals point to the same area, it often increases the probability of a strong follow-through. Acting on confirmation rather than prediction is the key to building a solid position in setups like this.

Within this period, the premier cryptocurrency saw a decline to as low as $80,600, marking a more than 10% deviation from the aforementioned support. As the price stands fairly over $90,000, there seems to be a recovery underway. However, a closer monitoring of on-chain activity has revealed that the reality is diametrically opposite to widespread expectation. LTH-STH SOPR Ratio Spikes To 2.63 — What This Means In a recent QuickTake post on CryptoQuant, the on-chain analytics platform Arab Chain reveals a shift within the internal structures of the Bitcoin market. This report revolves around readings obtained from the Binance: BTC SOPR Ratio (LTH – STH) metric, which assesses and compares the profit-taking behavior of Bitcoin’s long-term holders (LTH) to that of its short-term holders (STH). Arab Chain highlights that the LTH-STH ratio recently saw a spike to 2.63, a reading which marks the highest level put in since August. Notably, this spike in the SOPR index comes amid Bitcoin’s rise to around $90,000, signaling an underlying spike in LTH sell-off despite this modest rebound. This notion is confirmed by the Long-Term Holder SOPR itself, which reportedly to 2.58, indicating that members of Bitcoin’s most influential trend setters are currently exiting the market in deep profits. Normally, the sharp move in the LTH–STH ratio, especially one that causes the establishment of a multi-month high, usually represents a period of selling pressure that typically precedes price corrections. However, the current situation steers slightly away from this standard. ‘Profit-Taking Phase May Go On For Several Weeks’ — Analyst As the LTH SOPR reads 2.58, the STH SOPR stands at levels around the 0.98 mark, suggesting that the flagship cryptocurrency’s short-term holders are selling off their holdings either at break-even or even with some losses incurred. The market imbalance, therefore, reveals itself in that “long-term investors are capturing substantial profits and capitalizing on previous rallies to sell off, while short-term investors are unable to achieve clear gains.” Arab Chain explains that if the Bitcoin price decline should intensify, there could be additional acceleration dedicated to its fall down south. Historically, widening gaps between LTH and STH SOPR have often preceded defined movements in BTC’s market cycle. This behavior, according to Arab Chain, reveals that the market is likely entering a typical “cash-for-profit” phase, where its major holders sell off their holdings. Seeing as a surge of an almost comparable magnitude last took place in August, the firm conjectures that the market could see a major price reset, as opposed to the minor price fluctuation investors may be anticipating. As of this writing, Bitcoin is worth about $90,652, recording no significant movement over the past day.",Bitcoin|Arab Chain|bitcoin|Bitcoin LTH SOPR|Bitcoin STH SOPR|Long-Term Holders|LTH-STH Ratio,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-30 01:00:45

By 2028, $TRUMP could reach a maximum price of $28.45. In 2031, $TRUMP will range between $34.14 to $46.22. The Official Trump coin ($TRUMP) was launched on January 17, 2025, just three days before the inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump. Following President Trump’s “newfound” crypto inclination, the $TRUMP meme coin was birthed. My NEW Official Trump Meme is HERE! It’s time to celebrate everything we stand for: WINNING!

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 18, 2025 The coin has a total supply of 1 Billion tokens, with an initial 200 million tokens unlocked at launch. Subsequent unlocks are scheduled over the next three (3) years. $Trump token unlock roadmap Trump’s “advocacy” for digital assets reforms boosted interest in $TRUMP in the first few days, driving it to an all-time high (ATH) of $75.35. Several other meme tokens, like the Official MELANIA coin, also rode the momentum. Despite the initial surge, Official Trump’s value has plunged to lower levels amidst shifting market sentiment and uproar around the legitimacy of a “President-owned Meme coin.” The price performance of Official Trump is down over 85% from its all-time high, raising questions among investors, such as: How much will Trump coin be worth? Can Trump coin reach $100? This piece explores the Official Trump price predictions for 2025-2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Official Trump Token $TRUMP Price $6.05 Market Capitalization $1.208B Trading Volume $172.68M Circulating Supply 199.99M TRUMP All-time High $75.35 (January 19, 2025) All-time Low $1.21 (January 18, 2025) 24-h High $6.11 24-h Low $6.01 Official Trump technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 9.49% (High) 14-Day RSI 37.97 (Neutral) 50-Day SMA $6.88 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 28(Fear) Green Days 9/30 (30%) 200-Day SMA $9.31 Official Trump Coin ($TRUMP) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown Bearish momentum is fading for $TRUMP, but no solid reversal signals have formed yet. Official TRUMP coin’s price is stabilizing above $6, suggesting sellers are losing strength. Official Trump coin 1-day price analysis The daily chart for November 30 shows TRUMP trading at $6.05, sitting just above the lower Bollinger band at $5.60, where the price has been sliding but is now flattening. This compression signals selling pressure losing strength, though buyers have not yet reclaimed the mid-band at $6.68, which remains a strong resistance to watch. TRUMP/USDT 1-day price chart by TradingView Momentum remains weak, with the MACD sitting deep in bearish territory and still diverging lower, although the histogram is starting to lighten, an early hint that downside momentum is slowing rather than accelerating. The RSI at 38 shows oversold-leaning conditions but without any bullish divergence yet, meaning it’s too early to declare a trend reversal, though price stability above $5.60 would improve the odds. Official Trump 4-hour price analysis The 4-hour chart shows TRUMP hovering at $6.04, repeatedly testing but holding the $6.00 psychological level. The Alligator indicator remains fully open in a downward feed, confirming the downtrend is still active. However, the lines are beginning to converge slightly, indicating the bearish wave may be tiring. TRUMP/USDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The RSI on the 4-hour sits at 36, similar to the daily reading, suggesting sellers are losing strength, but buyers have not yet stepped in with conviction. OBV remains depressed, meaning volume inflows are still weak and any bounce will likely be gradual rather than explosive. $TRUMP technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $6.96 SELL SMA 5 $6.67 SELL SMA 10 $6.62 SELL SMA 21 $7.10 SELL SMA 50 $6.88 SELL SMA 100 $7.61 SELL SMA 200 $9.31 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $6.85 SELL EMA 5 $7.03 SELL EMA 10 $7.39 SELL EMA 21 $7.90 SELL EMA 50 $8.58 SELL EMA 100 $9.39 SELL EMA 200 $10.60 SELL What to expect from $TRUMP price analysis TRUMP is more likely to range and attempt a slow rebound from the $5.60–$6.00 zone, but until it breaks $6.15 with strength, the broader downtrend remains intact. The next 24–72 hours should focus on whether buyers defend $5.60, which will dictate whether consolidation continues or the trend weakens further. Is Official Trump a good investment? Meme coins like $TRUMP are volatile and driven by hype, not fundamentals. While they can offer big rewards, they come with high risk and uncertainty. If you’re making an investment decision on TRUMP coin, do your own research carefully and prepare for price swings. Why is $TRUMP down? $TRUMP plunged hard post‑launch, now rattling in a tight $5–8 consolidation over the past month as traders wait for new hype or a breakdown. With most tokens controlled by insiders, sentiment remains weak, and only fresh utility or momentum could revitalize it. Official Trump coin price history by Coingecko Will Official Trump reach $50 soon? $TRUMP coin already saw this price point in January; increased investor interest could result in a quick resurgence. Will Official Trump reach $100? Having touched a peak price of $75.35 and a market cap of $15 billion in its first few weeks, the $100 milestone might not be much of a hurdle to scale, provided $TRUMP can recapture the momentum it had in its earlier days. Will $TRUMP reach $1000? For $TRUMP to hit $1,000, its market cap would need to rise over 100× into the hundreds of billions, or even trillions if locked supply is released. With dilution risks, weak fundamentals, regulation, and competition, the chance of this happening in the next few years is very low.” Does Official Trump have a good long-term future? The long-term future of the Official Trump Coin is uncertain. While it has gained attention, peaked at $75, and generated significant revenue, its success will depend on crypto market trends, investor confidence, and how it navigates regulatory challenges. Recent news/opinion on $TRUMP Melania ‘meme coin’ value bottoms out as Trump brands collapse: WSJ Wall Street Journal reports that the market has “soured” on Trump brands. Reporter Jack Pitcher wrote, “Digital ‘meme coins’ named for Trump and first lady Melania Trump are down 86% and 99% since inauguration day, respectively.

Official TRUMP historic price sentiment Official Trump coin price history by Coingecko Official Trump coin was launched on January 17, 2025, just a few days before the US presidential inauguration. Briefly after launch, the euphoria of DJT’s inauguration drove the $TRUMP coin to an all-time high of $75.35. As expected, market players took profit, and the Official Trump coin lost momentum, hitting a low of $18.75 by February 1, a massive 75% drop in price. Further price declines followed, but $TRUMP showed some resilience, reaching a high of $24 by mid-February, albeit short-lived. The bears recaptured the market in the following months, and the Official Trump coin settled at lower prices – about $7 to $11 between March and April. $TRUMP hit a high of $16.28 by April end, but has since maintained an average price of about $10.5. Official Trump coin traded between $8.07 and $10.13 in August. In September, TRUMP maintained a trading range of $7.37-$9.46, and in October, it traded between $7.65-$8.02.

According to reports , the incident forced the plant to shut down its generation and data center operations, temporarily stopping both company-run rigs and machines operating for clients. Electrical Switchgear Failure Reported Based on reports, an electrical switchgear malfunction on November 23, 2025 started the fire and triggered automatic safety systems that de-energized the facility. The Dresden plant, which has about 106 megawatts of generation capacity, was taken offline immediately to prevent further damage. Company filings and local updates said none of the hosted mining machines — including those co-located for NYDIG — suffered material damage during the event. A fire just halted operations at Greenidge Generation’s #Bitcoin mining site — a major facility co-hosting rigs for NYDIG. No hardware lost, but the incident reveals a hidden risk: physical infrastructure fragility in the mining stack. #BTC #MiningOps #CryptoInfra #NYBitcoin pic.twitter.com/35sMu2x3le — ₿itBlitz (@BitBlitz) November 28, 2025 Emergency crews responded and the fire was contained, but the outage left the site idle while technicians inspected equipment and repaired infrastructure. Impact On Mining Operations And Clients Reports have disclosed that the shutdown means lost hashing time for every miner at the site. For co-hosting customers like NYDIG, downtime translates to missed block rewards until the machines can be safely powered up again. Mining firms typically earn revenue only while rigs run, so even a short stoppage can cut into weekly receipts. Industry observers noted that the Dresden plant is a major part of Greenidge’s US footprint, so the pause affects a sizable share of the company’s output. Bitcoin Mining Economics Under Pressure Mining profitability is under strain across the board as network difficulty climbs and competition increases. Based on recent market data, margins are tighter than in prior cycles, making every hour of offline time more costly. Investigation And Recovery Timetable According to the company, crews are working to restore service and Greenidge expects a return to normal operations within a few weeks. That timetable is provisional and tied to the results of inspections and replacement of damaged switchgear. Regulators and insurers will likely review the incident, and an internal investigation is expected to clarify the cause of the failure and whether any maintenance gaps contributed. Stakeholders will watch closely for confirmed repair schedules and any disclosures about lost bitcoin production or costs tied to the outage. Co-hosts will also monitor whether the incident prompts changes to safety practices or contract terms for hosted rigs.

Following this move, the Central Asian nation joins the expanding list of countries opting for regulation in the crypto industry against an outright ban. Turkmenistan Explores Crypto Amid Economy Diversification On Friday, Reuters reported that President Serdar Berdymukhamedov of Turkmenistan signed a new law that will permit registration of crypto exchanges and crypto mining companies from January 1, 2026. Notably, this development appears to represent part of the state government’s recent efforts to diversify its economy beyond gas exports, following Turkmenistan’s status as the nation with fourth fourth-largest gas reserves. Reuters also confirmed the government’s motive behind its new regulation, stating an intent to drive investment and speed up digitalization. While there are no official data on the level of crypto ownership in Turkmenistan, citizens’ ability to purchase digital assets using credit/debit cards, as well as the existence of Bitcoin ATMs, indicate significant traction requiring legalization. In particular, local Kyrgyzstan media states the new regulations signed by President Berdymukhamedov assert the legal status of cryptocurrencies as civil assets but with no economic power to serve as currency or means of payment. Furthermore, all licensed crypto exchanges are mandated to ensure the protection of users’ data and deposits. Meanwhile, mining operations can be performed by both individuals and local businesses following approval and registration with the recognized state authority. Other aspects of Turkmenistan’s crypto regime cover specific definitions of terms, and operations center around offering, transfer, issuance, and storage. Crypto Adoption Surges In Central Asia Beyond Turkmenistan, other nations in Central Asia, including Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, are also ramping up crypto regulatory efforts to create an enabling environment for digital assets adoption. Notably, Uzbekistan has completed legal preparations to formally adopt stablecoins for payments in 2026, while also permitting the trading of tokenized stocks on licensed exchanges. Meanwhile, Bitcoinist reported that Kazakhstan has recently allocated $500 million – $1 billion for a national reserve fund with a potential launch slated for 2026. In addition, the former soviet state also introduced a national stablecoin, KZTx, in collaboration with the world’s biggest exchange, Binance. Taken together, these crypto-friendly moves show that Central Asian nations are doubling down on blockchain and digital assets as an emerging pillar of the global financial sector. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the total crypto market cap is now valued at $3.05 trillion following a modest rebound in the last week after an extended correction that began in early October.",Crypto News|crypto exchanges|crypto mining|Crypto Regulations|Kazakhstan|Reuters|Turkmenistan|Uzbekistan,EN,0,0,ASIA|EXCHANGE|MINING|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-30 05:00:40

Here’s the Latest,https://timestabloid.com/institutions-using-coinbase-to-stack-xrp-into-cold-storage-heres-the-latest/,"Xaif (@Xaif_Crypto) posted a striking message on X showing a transaction of 11.64 million XRP sent to Coinbase. The image he shared detailed a successful transfer from a private account to Coinbase’s wallet. His post appeared as activity around XRP increased following the launch of new spot ETFs . Xaif tied the activity to previous comments made by industry analyst Chad Steingraber. He argued that movements of this size into Coinbase should not be treated as random. With Coinbase acting as the main custodian for asset managers, he sees the transfer as institutions placing XRP into cold storage for ETFs. As @ChadSteingraber said when you see 11.64M $XRP getting moved into Coinbase, it’s no coincidence. With Coinbase as the primary custodian for asset managers, this is institutions stacking XRP straight into cold storage. https://t.co/O7qOgQzFP4 pic.twitter.com/RtIW3YOhxN — Xaif Crypto| (@Xaif_Crypto) November 28, 2025 ETF Growth Changes XRP Custody ETFs have gained significant attention over the past few weeks. These products allow asset managers to gain exposure through regulated markets rather than direct exchange trading. Since their launch, these products have seen major inflows , with investors rapidly joining the XRP market. The launch of XRP ETFs changed how XRP moves through the market. Funds must hold the asset with a regulated custodian. Coinbase fills that role for most major asset managers in the U.S. That setup explains why large amounts of XRP are now flowing into Coinbase wallets. These transfers do not signal selling pressure. They point to custody. Tokens sent in for ETF backing move into cold storage. Chad Steingraber had earlier explained this pattern. He said large Coinbase inflows often reflect institutional positioning rather than normal exchange use. Xaif’s post echoed that view and added clear transaction data as support. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Impact of Cold Storage Once XRP enters cold storage , it leaves the active trading pool. These tokens are not placed on order books. They are held for long periods to back ETF shares. This process has already reduced the amount of XRP available on exchanges. Public data shows exchange balances are declining . That trend has slowed supply while ETF demand grows. The 11.64 million XRP transfer Xaif shared fits neatly into this picture. It reflects how ETFs change both custody and circulation. Each new fund purchase removes more XRP from liquid markets. The transfer Xaif highlighted does not stand alone. Large token movements have appeared in recent weeks. Together, they show a system forming behind the ETFs. Asset managers do not trade in and out daily. They accumulate and hold. As these products expand, more XRP will shift into long-term storage. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Although it was stopped there, it now stands close to $0.26, which actually means that its monthly performance is quite promising compared to the rest of the market, as almost all of its digital asset competitors have posted double-digit losses. But the question now arises of what’s next, and we decided to get in touch with ChatGPT and Perplexity to check their views on the matter for PI in December. Is ChatGPT Bullish? Despite the recent positive PI performance, in which the asset gained over 50% since its all-time low on October 10, its overall trend since it saw the light of day in February this year has been quite painful, and ChatGPT reminded that investors should also pay attention to that 90% drop. Nevertheless, it believes that the recent stabilization above $0.23 is the first good sign as it suggests that “sellers may finally be losing control.” It noted that the $0.21-$0.23 support is crucial for PI and could determine its overall performance in December. In terms of actual price predictions, ChatGPT said the token could reach up to $0.35 over the next several weeks. To do so, it would need alignment across several factors, such as better overall market conditions and continued updates to the Pi Network ecosystem, including the latest improvements in the Pi App Studio. In contrast, if the market heads for another correction and PI fails to break the $0.27 resistance, then it could fulfill the bear-case scenario, which envisions another drop below $0.20 and possibly challenging the ATL of just over $0.172. It actually noted that this is the least likely scenario as PI will now enter December “in a stronger position than it’s been in months,” before it added: “The token shows stability, improving structure, and relative strength compared to the broader market. If the ecosystem continues to expand — and if macro conditions don’t deteriorate — PI could deliver one of its better months.” Does Perplexity Agree? ChatGPT’s competitor wasn’t as hopeful for PI. It began its prediction by noting that analysts are “bearish short-term” for December, with “models forecasting averages of $0.198 and ranges of $0.194-$0.202, implying potential 20-25% drops from current levels.” It said that some technical indicators, such as the RSI going above 65, suggest PI might be overbought and due for a correction. It also noted that the overall crypto market is not out of the woods yet, which could trigger another industry-wide correction that can impact Pi Network’s native token as well. In conclusion, Perplexity warned investors to be wary about PI’s performance in the next month. Although there’s a chance for “flat-to-modest gains,” it added that “bearish forecasts suggest a cautious year-end around $0.20.” The post How High Can Pi Network’s (PI) Price Go in December? 2 AIs Speculate With Big Numbers appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|Pi Network (PI),EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-11-30 05:15:55

This session did not follow that pattern. Within 2 hours and 30 minutes of the U.S. market opening, XRP-based ETFs posted notable trading activity. Crypto commentator Xaif (@Xaif_Crypto) shared the figures in a post on X, highlighting the massive trading volume.

Canary Capital led the group with $4.67 million. Franklin Templeton followed closely at $4.24 million. Bitwise ranked third at $4.09 million. Grayscale recorded $1.64 million, while Rex Osprey posted $1.40 million. Canary Capital has been a notable force in the ETF market since its launch. It hit a record volume of $58 million on its launch day. However, Franklin Templeton and Bitwise are also making notable waves in the market. The tight spread at the top shows that all three funds are trading within a narrow band. That pattern showed no single issuer had locked up liquidity. Xaif summed up the action with a short remark. “Institutional money is rotating fast,” he wrote. He added that “the XRP ETF race is only getting louder.” What to Expect from ETFs Xaif’s data focused strictly on what had already traded. Another market participant added a forward-looking note. Chad Steingraber, who had previously analyzed the market’s performance, predicted that the funds could reach $50 million before the halfway point of the trading session. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 At the start of the week, these funds closed with a total volume of over $85 million . That value excluded the Rex Osprey ETF, and the current pace suggests it could surpass that volume before the end of the current session. Expansion Still Ahead These five ETFs represent only the first wave. Several issuers continue to prepare additional XRP-related products. Some filings target different fee structures. Others aim at alternative custody or liquidity arrangements. Some experts have suggested that up to 12 XRP ETFs are ready to launch . As more products reach the market, volume will likely spread further before consolidating again. The early session numbers show one thing clearly. XRP ETFs have entered an active phase.

Zhao touched upon the importance of investor psychology in his post on his social media account. “It may be an unpopular opinion, but the best strategy is to sell during periods of maximum greed and buy during periods of maximum fear,” Zhao said, reminding that opportunities arise, especially during periods when the market enters panic mode. After Bitcoin retreated to $81,000, market sentiment deteriorated sharply. With Bitcoin trading at $90,710, the Cryptocurrency Fear & Greed Index clearly reflects the deterioration in investor sentiment. As of today, the index sits at 20, falling into the “fear” category. Related News: Strategy CEO Responds: Will the Company Sell Bitcoin? What Will Happen to the BTC Price in the Future? While this level is the same as yesterday's, it represents a significant improvement compared to last week. The index had fallen to the “extreme fear” zone last week, falling as low as 10. The index, which was again in the “fear” zone at 39 a month ago, reveals that investor sentiment has been stuck in negative territory for a long time. The picture is even more striking when comparing year-to-year: the index peaked at 84 in November 2024, at the “extreme greed” level, and then fell to the 10 level in November 2025, reaching its annual low, demonstrating the drastic shift in market sentiment. CZ's message reiterates the importance of these emotional swings to investment strategies, and current market conditions support his words. Despite Bitcoin's gain of over 7% in the past week, the overall market remains subdued, prompting investors to exercise caution. *This is not investment advice.

However, a monumental shift is now underway as Apple Pay has integrated into leading crypto platforms, and getting a major upgrade is becoming as seamless and intuitive as any other digital transaction. This integration removes one of the biggest barriers to entry by replacing traditional transactions. Why Apple’s Entry Signals A Turning Point For Global Crypto Payments Apple Pay is now directly integrated with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. A crypto site, CryptosRus, has revealed on X that Apple users can now purchase BTC and other cryptocurrencies directly within Trust Wallet using Apple Pay . This integration will make buying crypto as easy as buying Apps from the App Store, dramatically lowering friction for newcomers with no more clunky bank transfers , complex onboarding forms, and steep learning curves. With a few simple taps via Apple Pay, the crypto will be in your Trust Wallet. In short, Apple is helping to replace fear and friction with just tap-and-own simplicity. This Apple Pay and crypto is the kind that will seamlessly onramp. Bitcoin and crypto adoption are sharply gaining traction globally. In a surprising turn for one of the world’s most tightly controlled economies, Turkmenistan has officially legalized Bitcoin and broader cryptocurrency trading. CryptosRus stated that President Serdar Berdimuhamedov has signed a new Sweeping bill that sets the stage for a fully regulated crypto market to begin in 2026. The new law establishes a dedicated state Commission that will oversee licensing, Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) protocols, cold-storage rules, mining registration, and even the power to halt or require refunds for token issuances. According to CryptoRus, this is a sign that even the most controlled states are being pushed into crypto adoption as the global regulation accelerates. Bitcoin Decentralized Rails More Resilient Than TradFi Hardware? An author and ideologist, Shanaka Anslem Perera, pointed out that the day $13.4 billion in Bitcoin options expired, the traditional financial system nearly collapsed. At the crucial hour of 03:00 GMT, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) froze, a cooling failure originating from a single data center. The failure led to 90% of global derivatives trading being halted. Meanwhile, a larger sum of $15 billion in crypto options was settled on time, with each block confirmed and every trade seamlessly executed. The machines that price the world stopped working because they were overheated, and the decentralized alternative rails ran exactly as designed. “This isn’t a coincidence, it’s a stress test , and only one system passed the test,” Shanaka noted.",Bitcoin|AML|Anti-Money Laundering|apple|Apple Pay|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Chicago Mercantile Exchange|CME|CryptoRus|know-your-customer|KYC|Shanaka Anslem Perera,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-30 06:30:06

Analysts monitoring the early trading activity suggest that sustained ETF accumulation could meaningfully reduce the quantity of XRP available to retail markets, potentially influencing the token’s valuation. This development has raised questions about how such a scenario might affect investors holding moderate amounts of the digital asset, particularly those with 1,000 to 5,000 XRP. Rising ETF Demand and Early Accumulation Trends Since their debut, XRP ETFs have attracted substantial inflows. Within the first eleven trading days, the four available products collectively gained approximately $666 million in net purchases. This figure has already surpassed the inflows recorded by the six Solana ETFs, which reached $618 million after twenty-three days. The pace of accumulation has prompted speculation that ETF issuers could, at some point, absorb a significant share of XRP held on centralized exchanges. This possibility has been highlighted by commentators who argue that persistent inflows could tighten supply conditions over time. Estimating How Long Exchange Reserves Could Last Digital Perspectives founder Brad Kimes recently reviewed exchange liquidity estimates using Grok, which assessed XRP tokens that are accessible for active trading. According to the model’s response, major platforms such as Binance, Upbit, Bithumb, and OKX collectively hold between 5 and 6 billion XRP in liquid reserves as of late November 2025. The report also indicated that Binance controls the largest share, approximately 2.71 billion XRP. This figure has declined by roughly 400 million tokens between early October and mid-November, reflecting ongoing withdrawals and ETF-driven demand. Grok further observed that exchanges lost about 73 million XRP in a single day during recent market activity, suggesting continued outflows and reduced selling pressure. Overall, the estimated 5 to 6 billion XRP in liquid supply represents around 9% to 11% of the circulating 56 billion tokens. To evaluate how quickly ETFs could remove this supply, the model reviewed inflows from Nov. 25 to 27. During this period, issuers received an average of $26 million per day. At an XRP price of $2.20, this equates to roughly 11.8 million XRP purchased daily. Based on this rate, Grok estimated that clearing 5 billion XRP would take about 422 days, while removing 6 billion XRP would require approximately 506 days, placing the timeline between 14 and 17 months. Projected Price Ranges Under a Supply Reduction Scenario To understand the potential price impact , Google Gemini was consulted. The model emphasized that price responses to supply constraints tend to accelerate as available liquidity decreases. Gemini referenced a Bank of America analysis from 2021 showing that each $1 entering Bitcoin during constrained periods contributed significantly more to total market value. Using comparable assumptions, Gemini proposed several potential XRP price ranges if ETF accumulation removes most of the remaining liquid supply. The initial range falls between $8 and $13, assuming steady momentum. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A deeper supply reduction could support valuations between $20 and $25, particularly if the broader market revalues major assets and Ethereum approaches a higher market capitalization. Gemini also outlined a more extreme case, where limited liquidity forces ETF issuers to purchase at progressively higher prices, which could push XRP above $50. Gemini suggested that such an increase could unfold across three stages within seventeen months: An initial accumulation period lifting XRP from $2.20 to around $5, a middle phase driving the price toward $15, and a final period characterized by accelerated increases into the $20 to $50+ region. Current data indicates that 596,029 wallets contain between 1,000 and 5,000 XRP, making this one of the largest holder groups. Presently , 1,000 XRP is worth $2,210, and 5,000 XRP is worth around $11,050. If XRP reaches $50, 1,000 XRP would rise to $50,000, while 5,000 XRP would expand to $250,000. Even at a $20 price level, 1,000 XRP would be worth $20,000, and 5,000 XRP would be valued at $100,000. These estimates illustrate the scale of gains for holders if ETF accumulation significantly reduces supply. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

(95% will be EXIT LIQUIDITY) RT for updates!… pic.twitter.com/vVgarmipVz — JD (@jaydee_757) November 28, 2025 A Crucial Message to Traders JD kept his message direct. He said he expects one last move before a sharp correction. He also warned that most traders will not react fast enough and said, “95% will be EXIT LIQUIDITY .” His statement shows his belief that market participants often refuse to sell early and then face the downside. The chart he shared supports that view. It shows XRP on the monthly timeframe with an ascending triangle that formed over several years. The price moved inside a clear rising trendline and tested a horizontal resistance multiple times. The Technical Picture In late 2024, XRP experienced a sharp rise that sent it above the ascending triangle. This breakout gave way to another crucial technical pattern. JD displayed RSI data at the bottom of the chart. The RSI formed a lower low while the price formed a higher low. He marked this as hidden bullish divergence . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This condition appears when momentum weakens during a pullback, but the price holds its trend. Traders view that as a sign of continuation rather than trend exhaustion. JD pointed to this to support his expectation for one more upward move. Where XRP Could Be Heading Based on the chart, the structure remains intact as long as XRP stays above the rising trendline. The hidden bullish divergence gives the setup more strength. If buyers defend this level, XRP can reach the projected breakout zone before momentum fades. That aligns with JD’s expectation of a final push. JD has previously predicted a 95% crash after XRP’s next bullish move. In his post, the analyst describes the coming move as a rug pull crash. Traders now need to watch the asset’s movement around the rising trendline. This, combined with the RSI behavior, will determine whether XRP completes the move JD anticipates and starts the decline he has predicted.

On the question of what type of investors might be behind this increase, on-chain data suggests that it’s all about whales now. Whales Buying, Retail Sidelines? Data shared by Crypto Rover, which compares the whale vs retail data, indicates that the larger cohort of investors has been a lot more active lately. In fact, their behavior has been linked to the overall price movements of the underlying asset in the past several weeks, including a selling spree in early October when BTC peaked above $126,000 and dumped by $15,000 in days. Now, though, the data points to significant accumulation efforts once bitcoin slumped by $25,000 in just over a week to under $81,000.

ETF Investors Are Back What could be even more bullish on BTC’s upcoming price actions is the recent return of investors buying through the spot Bitcoin ETFs . The financial vehicles were in a ton of trouble for the past month, with a substantial exodus from all funds, especially BlackRock’s IBIT. The past week was the first in the green since early October, albeit in a rather modest manner. After the $151 million in net withdrawals on Monday, investors poured in $128.7 million on Tuesday, $21.1 million on Wednesday, and $71.4 million on Friday (Thursday was an official Holiday in the US). Consequently, the week ended with a minor net inflow of $70.2 million, which is still a lot better than the $1.2 billion taken out during the previous trading week.

Today, experts recognize that the same pattern appears to be emerging in Mutuum Finance, an innovative cryptocurrency that has hit the markets with much better fundamentals than ADA offered in the first year when it initially broke out, and with an actual use case in the DeFi space, including lending and interest-bearing tokens, and an impending release of testnet v1, among other things. Mutuum Finance , at $0.035, and gaining pace in its presale, and boasting now over 18,250 early adopters, finds itself on the path leading to the same success factor in the crypto markets that ADA enjoyed in 2020–2021. For investors seeking the best crypto to buy, MUTM offers a tangible utility and growth potential beyond legacy altcoins. Cardano Attempts a Short-Term Rebound as Buyers Hold Key Support Cardano (ADA) is still stabilizing above the latest low, making way for a short-term bounce. There could still be room in the ongoing bounce to reach the $0.45–$0.48 equal legs area, where past bounce attempts have indicated the likelihood of sellers re-emerging. As much as the ongoing relief rally on ADA denotes improvement in the short term, the ADA price still has much work to do in order to change the medium-term outlook. While ADA traders are watching the pivotal price levels, some investors are assessing the Mutuum Finance, which is now recognized as the top crypto in emerging DeFi markets. Mutuum Finance Presale Attracts Huge Interest Mutuum Finance, has quickly become the best crypto to buy in 2025. The presale has managed to gather over 18,250 distinct individuals, garnering over $19.02 million. The current price for Phase 6 tokens is $0.035. As the presale phases advance into Phase 7, the price of the tokens will rise by an added 20% to $0.04. The uniqueness in Mutuum Finance compared to other altcoins lies in their high-level adoption, making it a top crypto for early-stage DeFi investors. Growth Catalyst 1: Dual Lending Framework Mutuum Finance, will accelerate the adoption of the platform through their dual approach in lending. The Peer-to-Contract platform pools large assets like USDT and SOL through properly verified and secured smart contracts. The interest rate varies according to the use rate. Using an example, when the user lends $15,000, they receive the mtUSDT token, and an approximate 15% annual interest rate, resulting in $2,250 annually. The borrowers can pledge their assets, like $2,000 in ADA asset, in exchange for $1,500 in USDT liquidity. The Stability Factor and liquidation conditions in the protocol guarantee the solvency and optimal use of funds. Conversely, high volatility assets like Dogecoin are covered using the Peer-to-Peer lending module. In this scenario, the traders negotiate the terms themselves and are conscious that they are dealing with high risks in the hopes of acquiring higher returns. In the short term, traders will be able to provide, borrow, and stake their funds in specially designated pools in order to generate fixed returns. This environment makes MUTM the best crypto to invest in, specifically designed for traders who actively use the DeFi ecosystem. Growth Catalyst 2: Fee-to-Buyback Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will use platform fees on lending, borrowing, and staking as incentives to trigger a systematic process of buying back their tokens, MUTM. The purchased MUTM tokens will then be given out to those who stake their tokens in the network, effectively engendering increased activity. By correlating real on-chain activity with tangible rewards, the system encourages people to stay involved in the long run rather than speculating on the future value. This makes MUTM a top crypto for those seeking sustained utility and growth. Protocol Launch Strategy & Exchange Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) aims to debut in the Sepolia Testnet by the end of 2025, and the supported assets in the beginning are ETH and USDT, specifically used in lending, borrowing, and providing collateral. The initial version will help in enabling basic functionalities like the liquid pools, mtToken, and debt token, and liquidator bot. The testnet functionality provides an earlier opportunity to interact with the platform, and this shall enable users who join the testing process to become well-versed with the platform before the launch of the mainnet. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has rapidly increased in popularity among crypto projects in 2025, with the ongoing Phase 6 presale now over 95% sold, having raised over $19.02 million from over 18,250 members. Mutuum Finance has a dual lending model, fee-to-buyback engine, and plans to launch the Sepolia testnet. Get involved today and claim your spot in the Mutuum Finance Presale, where you can invest in the best crypto to buy and secure one of the most promising top crypto projects before the next market rally.

As one of the Asia-Pacific region’s most historic golf tournaments, the Championship provides a high-impact platform for KuCoin to engage partners, clients, and the broader community while elevating its brand presence alongside Australian golf icon and KuCoin Global Brand Ambassador Adam Scott. As part of the collaboration, KuCoin hosted an invite-only VIP hospitality experience on November 28 in a private suite overlooking the 17th hole. Designed as a strategic engagement platform rather than a traditional client event, the gathering brought together industry leaders, institutional partners, and regulatory-aligned stakeholders to deepen dialogue on building a trusted and compliant digital asset ecosystem in Australia. Set against the backdrop of KuCoin’s AUSTRAC registration and ongoing commitment to strengthening local oversight, the experience featured a premium environment with curated food, beverages, and interactive brand showcases that highlighted KuCoin’s security, transparency, and governance frameworks. The event served as an important touchpoint for advancing responsible industry collaboration and reinforcing KuCoin’s long-term commitment to compliant growth and user protection in the Australian market. Tika LUM, Head of Global Institutional Business Development at KuCoin, delivered opening remarks, covering the strategic upgrade of KuCoin Institutional and showcasing its core competencies anchored in trusted compliance, secure infrastructure, and continuous innovation—all aimed at empowering clients with advanced services, deep market intelligence, and exclusive VIP experiences. The highlight of the afternoon was an exclusive meet-and-greet with Adam Scott, which offered attendees a memorable opportunity to connect with KuCoin Global Brand Ambassador while watching tournament play from the suite’s outdoor balcony. Adam joined a quick Q&A session with Tika, sharing his experiences with professional golf training methods and technical skills, as well as the shared values between himself and KuCoin—values that mirror KuCoin’s commitment to building a secure, resilient, and innovative trading infrastructure. The activation fostered meaningful interaction with KuCoin leadership and strengthened local relationships, underscoring the company’s focus on trust, innovation, and user empowerment in the crypto industry. “This partnership with the Australian PGA Championship was a tremendous success, blending the precision and tradition of golf with KuCoin’s forward-thinking approach to cryptocurrency,” said Tika LUM, Head of Global Institutional Business Development at KuCoin. “It was an honor to host our partners and clients in such an iconic setting, and Adam Scott’s involvement truly elevated the experience.” Building on this momentum, KuCoin continues to deepen its investment in Australia. The company recently secured registration as a Digital Currency Exchange (DCE) provider with AUSTRAC, introducing new compliance requirements and improving fiat access for Australian users. In addition, KuCoin has established a new office in Sydney’s CBD and appointed James Pinch as its Australian Managing Director to lead local operations across compliance, operations, cybersecurity, and product development. These developments reflect KuCoin’s long-term commitment to building a secure, user-centric digital asset ecosystem in Australia and supporting the country’s evolving Web3 landscape. About KuCoin Founded in 2017, KuCoin is a leading global crypto platform built on trust, serving over 40 million users across 200+ countries and regions.

In its post, Binance argued that when the trading volumes of seven major crypto exchanges were examined, direct flows from illicit wallets were at extremely low levels, and that Binance, despite having much higher volumes, had the lowest exposure in the industry. However, according to Chainalysis, the picture isn't that simple. The company stated in a statement that Binance's analysis only calculated direct illicit flows, excluding critical categories such as ransomware, hacked funds, and indirect transfers through intermediate wallets. The statement included the following: “For example, if an illicit wallet first sends funds to a personal wallet and then to Binance, this will not show up in the analysis.” Chainalysis noted that these “wallet chain” methods are widely used by criminals, but can often be traced with the right analytics tools. According to the company's data, $2.2 billion in crypto assets stolen through hacks last year alone reached $1.7 billion. Binance updated its blog post on November 19 following criticism, stating that the analysis was created by the company's own team using Chainalysis and TRM Labs datasets, and that only direct exposure was taken into account in the calculation. Chainalysis's warning comes as Binance has recently been trying to signal stricter regulatory compliance. In 2023, the company paid $4.3 billion in fines for violating anti-money laundering rules, conducting unauthorized money transfers, and evading sanctions. Then-CEO Changpeng Zhao was sentenced to four months in prison but received a presidential pardon in October. Related News: Altcoins with the Most Buybacks in the Last 30 Days Revealed TRM Labs, another analytics firm cited by Binance, also issued a critical statement on the matter. The company's global policy director, Ari Redbord, stated that the 0.018% rate cited by Binance was a “snapshot” of Binance's exposure in June 2025, limited in scope, and only addressed direct exposure. Redbord noted that this figure was not taken from TRM's publicly available reports, but rather from a dataset provided exclusively to Binance: This number did not come from a publicly available TRM report. It was taken from a dataset provided exclusively to Binance. Binance has full discretion in interpreting and framing it. *This is not investment advice.

By press time, the asset was valued at $2.20, having gained about 0.8% in the past 24 hours, while on the weekly timeline, the asset is up almost 9%. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold XRP price on Christmas Day To determine how the asset might trade on Christmas 2025, Finbold consulted OpenAI’s artificial intelligence model, ChatGPT , which cited several factors likely to influence the asset’s price. According to ChatGPT, one of the key factors influencing XRP’s price is the resolution of its legal dispute with the SEC. With regulatory uncertainty removed, institutional investors are more likely to enter, supporting a higher baseline price for XRP. At the same time, the launch of XRP investment vehicles like ETFs and ETPs has also played a role, though early flows have been modest. These products offer increased structural demand, and as they attract more capital, they could support future price gains. Additionally, active treasury and SPAC buying programs aim to raise over $1 billion to purchase XRP on the open market. If these initiatives begin executing buybacks in December, they could provide steady upward pressure on the price. The model also pointed to broader market conditions that also impact XRP. While the crypto market faced weakness in November 2025, a potential rebound in December, especially if the U.S. The Federal Reserve signals a rate cut, could boost investor sentiment and drive XRP’s price higher. XRP price prediction By considering these factors, ChatGPT predicts that XRP will be valued at approximately $3.10 on December 25, with an expected range between $2.40 and $4.50. The most likely price will sit between $2.60 and $3.60. If these factors align positively, XRP could push past $3.50, with the possibility of reaching as high as $4.50. On the other hand, if macro conditions remain weak or delays occur in ETF or SPAC activity, the price could fall below $2.20. XRP price prediction for December 25.

The price has stayed steady on the weekly chart while many indicators have cooled off. This has created an unusual mix of stability and low momentum. Charting Guy (@ChartingGuy), a technical analyst on X, shared his view of this setup and explained why he still sees strength in the current structure. His post focused on support, the behavior of the RSI, and what the pattern signals for XRP. $XRP is still NOT bearish in the slightest building support on prior cycle high as well as top of golden pocket the chart where people show you monthly RSI losing steam.. why didn’t they show you all that in January 2025 when RSI topped?

He pointed to price action on the weekly chart and said XRP is building support on a prior cycle high. He added that it also sits on the top of the golden pocket. These levels often act as strong support zones in trending markets. Also, they help show whether buyers remain active. The chart he shared places XRP above the 0.786 Fibonacci level. Its price has tapped this region several times without breaking below it. This zone used to be a major resistance . Now it serves as support. That shift can play a key role in market structure. Charting Guy’s view is that XRP still respects this structure and continues to move in a stable range. RSI Slide Through 2025 Charting Guy questioned why some users now point to the monthly RSI. He asked why analysts did not do this in early 2025 when it peaked. He said the indicator lost momentum throughout 2025, even as XRP stayed in the same price band. While some experts believe the RSI indicates a bullish resurgence , the analyst’s pattern shows a long momentum reset without a price drop. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This pattern often shows up when a market slows down to reset. The RSI can fall for months while the price remains stable. This is a signal of easing selling pressure. It also shows that buyers still control the range. Reaccumulation Structure and Outlook Charting Guy called the setup a “very textbook reaccumulation signal.” Momentum cooled, but the price held its range and stayed above key Fibonacci levels. XRP defends support. This shows that buyers continue to step in at these levels. XRP remains stable despite weak momentum readings through 2025. Charting Guy noted that the structure has not broken, and buyers continue to support the range. If XRP holds these levels, the pattern may create room for a stronger move when momentum returns .

With the last month of the year just around the corner, we decided to focus on the third-largest non-stablecoin cryptocurrency and asked some of the most popular AIs about their take on what December holds for XRP. What’s Next (ChatGPT Edition)? ChatGPT outlined XRP’s difficult past few months, especially since its all-time high marked in mid-July. By October, the asset had lost all of its yearly momentum and dumped below $2 during the first market-wide crash. The second, which took place in the middle of November, drove it south hard once again to roughly $1.80. Although the cross-border token has rebounded to around $2.20 as of now, it’s still slightly in the red on a YTD scale, which is quite interesting and perhaps unexpected given the overall bullish year. Aside from the ATH, Ripple saw the conclusion of the prolonged battle against the US SEC, and several spot XRP ETFs were launched in the country. OpenAI’s solution noted that the first positive sign for the token is the fact that it quickly reclaimed the $2.00 level after its latest correction. It remains “the most important line to protect heading into December” as a monthly close above it “keeps the long-term trend intact.” ChatGPT highlighted the following factors that can reignite XRP’s rally in the next month: strong ETF inflows, overall market stabilization or more profound recovery, and renewed whale accumulation – something that has been lacking for weeks. Its bull case envisions a price surge to $2.85, while its bear scenario predicts another slip below $2.00 and a December bottom of around $1.80. “December has the potential to be better than October and November, but XRP remains in a fragile position. If the broader market stabilizes, XRP could see a gradual rebound toward the mid-$2 range. However, without a strong catalyst, a full trend reversal seems unlikely before 2026,” – the AI chatbot concluded. XRP Through the Eyes of Perplexity and Grok Perplexity was slightly more bullish. Although it mentioned essentially the same calalysts that can drive another XRP rally, its best-case scenario forecasts a price surge beyond $3.00 and up to $3.40, which would be just inches below the July peak. Even its bearish prediction was higher than ChatGPT’s, as it doesn’t see a drop below $2.00 in December. Grok, on the other hand, believes such a decline might take place if the US Federal Reserve fails to lower the key interest rates or some other geopolitical tension caps XRP’s recent progress. Declining volume and whales realizing profits or capitulating could also contribute to another possible correction that can drive the asset toward the November low of $1.80. Nevertheless, both AIs said they don’t expect fireworks in the last month of the year, predicting moves of up somewhere between 5% and 20% tops.

55139182,https://cryptonews.com/?p=457920,1764492054,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/55139182.jpeg,Housing Crisis Pushes Young Americans Into Crypto Gambles: Study,https://cryptonews.com/news/housing-crisis-pushes-young-americans-into-crypto-gambles-study/,"A new study warns that a growing share of young Americans is turning to cryptocurrency not as an ideological choice, but as a financial gamble driven by despair over housing costs. Key Takeaways: Young Americans are turning to crypto out of financial desperation as housing becomes increasingly unaffordable. Researchers say “discouraged renters” replace saving with high-risk investing once homeownership feels impossible. Over time, this shift traps many in near-zero wealth while hopeful homeowners continue to build assets. The report argues that soaring home prices have reshaped how an entire generation thinks about money, risk and opportunity. US Homeownership Slips Out of Reach, Pushing Youth Toward Risky Bets Researchers found that the median US house price-to-income ratio has risen so sharply since the 1980s that today’s young adults would need nearly two extra years of income to afford the same home their parents could. As the possibility of owning a home fades, financial behavior shifts just as dramatically. Instead of saving for a down payment, many turn to volatile assets that offer a chance at a sudden leap in wealth. “Crypto becomes a substitute for the American Dream,” the authors write, describing digital assets as vehicles for high-risk, high-reward betting when conventional goals feel unreachable. Rather than reflecting faith in decentralization or distrust of banks, crypto participation is increasingly a coping strategy for a broken path to stability. The research identifies a tipping point the authors call “discouraged renters.” Once people conclude homeownership is no longer realistic, their financial habits change in lasting ways. Compared with homeowners of similar net worth, discouraged renters rack up about 10% more in credit card spending and are far more likely to disengage from long-term career ambition. The US housing bubble popped in 2007-08, causing a massive financial crisis. So what did the US do after? It inflated another housing bubble, which is even bigger now. Because the US economy is a financialized house of cards built on asset price bubbles. https://t.co/Fr54cJmTk9 pic.twitter.com/JLHPzPozTE — Ben Norton (@BenjaminNorton) November 30, 2025 The study links this mindset to the rising phenomenon of “quiet quitting,” where workers remain employed but emotionally checked out. Wealth levels also change how people interact with crypto. Renters holding between $50,000 and $300,000 in assets show the highest participation, falling into what the report describes as a no-man’s-land: too creditworthy to give up, yet too poor to buy property. Below $50,000, investment almost disappears, not for lack of interest, but for lack of cash. Crypto, the report notes, becomes a “last-chance lever,” a way to try to beat a system that no longer feels fair. Welfare programs soften the blow of failure, encouraging moonshot risk-taking with limited downside. However, the long-term effects are bleak. Over time, discouraged renters sink into what the study calls a near-zero wealth trap, while those who hold onto the hope of homeownership continue building capital. Global Housing Crisis Pushes Youth From Saving Into Crypto Speculation Young people in South Korea and Japan express similar disengagement under the weight of housing inflation, and both countries have fast-growing crypto communities. The pattern, researchers conclude, is global. When shelter becomes unattainable, speculation replaces saving. In March, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) revealed that it is exploring the potential use of blockchain and stablecoins to improve certain operational functions. Officials also debated a pilot program where a HUD grantee would receive payments via stablecoin, with the initiative first being tested in a single department before broader implementation.

During this time, the market’s largest altcoin gained by 7.22%, providing a much-needed relief after an extended correction that dominated the majority of the last two months. As price stabilizes, crypto analytics platform XWIN Research Japan shares a forward-looking assessment of Ethereum’s outlook, especially considering developments in the futures market. Related Reading: 320 Ether On The Move: Bhutan Ramps Up Its Staking Game Ethereum Bulls Buy The Dip After Weak Position Exits Amid the widespread correction of the crypto market in Q4 2025, Ethereum’s prices crashed from $4,700 to as low as $2,900, representing a 38% price decline. XWIN Research Japan reports this price fall coincided with certain relevant developments in the futures market. In particular, Ethereum’s open interest across all exchanges dropped from $21 billion to around $17 billion in late November, as overleveraged long positions were closed down, forcing traders to open new positions with moderate leverage size. Meanwhile, funding rates stayed positive but declined to around 0.002, meaning that the dominant bullish sentiment from mid-2025 greatly reduced. Looking at on-chain data, the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) is at 1.27, while Binance data shows it to be around 1.0, both values indicating Ethereum is in a neutral to fair value zone, suggesting a period of stability before the next major trend emerges. Meanwhile, the recent market recovery kick-started after ETH retested the realized price of whale addresses, indicating that large market players are bolstering their holdings. XWIN Research Japan supports this theory, noting that Ethereum Treasury BitMine has boosted its market holdings to 3.63 million ETH. Additionally, a BlackRock client recently acquired tens of millions of dollars’ worth of ETH, further reinforcing the strength of current market demand. However, despite this robust market demand, ETH Spot ETF net outflows for November hit $1.42 billion, indicating there is significant selling pressure in the market. Related Reading: Ethereum Fusaka Will Be ‘The Most Bullish Upgrade’ Ever, Pundit Claims Ethereum Market Outlook At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $3,003, reflecting a 0.22% loss in the past day. Despite its gains in the last week, the altcoin is still down by 22.34% over the last month, suggesting the majority of short-term holders are in losses. XWIN Research Japan explains that although the overleveraged position has been cleared out with market whales now ramping up their holding, Ethereum remains in a “bottom-building phase”. Therefore, investors should still anticipate a “choppy, sell-on-rally” price action in the short term. The analysts predict a major trend reversal with time as the current price area becomes increasingly attractive to investors for massive accumulation opportunities.

Many investors still focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum, yet activity around XRP now rises at a faster pace. XRP has seen a notable surge in attention from institutions in recent weeks with the launch of multiple spot XRP ETFs . Cointelegraph recently highlighted this trend in a post. It drew attention to ETF filings, rising institutional demand, legal clarity, and strong market infrastructure. These factors have positioned XRP ahead of other altcoins, giving it a strong foundation for growth. LATEST: Spot XRP ETF filings are surging as legal clarity, institutional demand and strong market infrastructure put $XRP ahead of other altcoins. pic.twitter.com/rBTQrEDdfn — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) November 28, 2025 Legal Clarity Supports New Filings Legal clarity has strengthened XRP’s base for regulated products. The road to legal clarity began with the July 2023 ruling that determined that XRP is not a security. Many institutions avoided the asset before this decision, but it rebuilt confidence in XRP. As a result, firms began engaging more with the asset. Most ETF filings emerged long before the legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ended in August . These institutions now see a clear path for XRP. The legal clarity also reduces the fear that a future ruling will block products that follow the asset. That shift encourages managers to design ETFs that match the demand for structured exposure. Investors respond to this with more confidence because the ruling removed a major source of doubt. Improved Market Structure Helps Adoption XRP’s ecosystem has grown more stable. Trading venues offer high liquidity and faster settlement, which lets managers plan products with fewer risks. Institutional capital is also rising , as investors want assets that can support large trades without delays. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP can handle quick transfers and heavy volume. This gives ETF issuers key data on market depth, custody procedures, and execution quality. These features matter to firms that want products ready for long-term use. XRP’s Leadership Role Many crypto issuers still face legal uncertainty, strict custody demands, and weak liquidity. These limits slow their progress while XRP benefits from clearer rules and stronger market activity. As regulators approve more XRP ETFs , regulated inflows could lift liquidity and improve access. ETF use may also support new strategies built on familiar structures. Advancement with XRP could guide how firms assess future products as they review liquidity, legal clarity, and market systems. XRP is now in a position that shapes expectations for upcoming ETF decisions across the market. It also gives XRP a leadership role among altcoins.

First, there’s Cardano with ADA, still in the focus among traders because of institutional buying and the small on-chain activity, potentially steady and slow on the rise. Next, there’s Dogecoin with DOGE, the forever meme-coin sensation, still in the limelight among those who like quick flashes in the collection, old-school hype now intermingled with the latest crypto trends. And then, there’s Mutuum Finance with the $0.035 new crypto coin called MUTM, the latest upstart on the rapid rise in the presale ranks, locking in the spot among the leading contenders in the crypto market. MUTM has already earned a reputation as the best crypto to invest in, thanks to its dual-lending protocol and practical DeFi use cases. Cardano Is Stuck in the Downtrend While Oversold Conditions Suggest an Upcoming Pullback Cardano (ADA) keeps encountering selling pressures since it broke the major $0.5097 support level, categorized earlier as a double-bottom support, keeping ADA in a major downtrend. The moment the momentum and RSI indices hit the oversold region, there could still be a relief rally in the near term, provided there are sufficient buyers. The technical charts reflect a falling wedge formation on the verge of convergence, hence ADA could test the $0.5097 support levels in the coming days, provided the bears hold on. In a world where the typical altcoins have numerous barriers in the markets, investors now find themselves gravitating slowly toward some emerging sectors. Catching attention in the process, is Mutuum Finance (MUTM), the new crypto coin gathering momentum. Dogecoin Displays Initial Strength Following Crucial Support Test Dogecoin (DOGE) has just escaped the falling channel, and the first signs of bullish momentum emerge after retesting the critical support at $0.1475. Analysts explain that provided the price is maintained above the pullback area, DOGE price may target $0.1652, $0.1749, and $0.1933 in the following days, and a breach below $0.1395 would be a sign the scenario is wrong. While DOGE prepares to possibly make some gains, traders are progressively opting for other available choices in the cryptocurrency market that boast great adoption and real use, triggering a growing interest in Mutuum Finance (MUTM), widely regarded as the best crypto to invest in 2025. The Presale of Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance is quickly growing in the DeFi space as the presale soars in Phase 6. The cost of the MUTM tokens is at $0.035, and this provides the last chance for investors before the cost rises by 20% in Phase 7, where the price becomes $0.04. Mutuum Finance has proven itself as the best crypto to invest in, following the rapid progress of its presale. The pre-sale has attracted the participation of over 18,250 investors globally, raising over $19.02 million, indicating great interest in the project across the globe. With its emphasis on transparency, innovative solutions, and sustainable development, MUTM has quickly become the leading choice among investors looking for a stable and high-growth prospect. The project is being recognized as a new crypto coin with tangible DeFi functionality. With the trend in the world markets shifting into a fresh bullish phase, early-stage DeFi investors remain attracted to the interesting niche and use case offered by MUTM. Tokenomics Designed for Real Utility Mutuum Finance sets itself apart because it has utility-oriented tokenomics, and the primary goal here is practical use rather than trading. Each transaction on the platform helps fuel the need for the token itself, so there’s a snowball effect. The platform has a dual lending system. There are Peer-to-Contract (P2C) collective markets, where the traded assets include ETH and stablecoins, and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) contracts that deal with riskier and less liquid coins. The combination of the two systems enables the protocol to be scalable and stable. All loans are fully over-collateralized and subject to the most stringent LTV ratios, and the interest rates can either be fixed or variable, and the choice lies with the borrower. For instance, when a borrower puts in $1,000 worth of ETH using an LTV of 75%, they can borrow a stable-coin loan up to $750. The APY accrues interest and acts as a motivation factor and indicator in ensuring the stability of the protocol. Driving Adoption through Passive Yield and Market Integration The uniqueness about Mutuum Finance is the concept of mtTokens, through which users are able to receive tokens in exchange when they provide funds to the platform. In conventional deposit systems, the earning on the deposit would only come when the deposit was withdrawn. With mtTokens, there is the ability to earn interest in real time. The system also has a buy and distribute functionality, where a percentage of the fees from the protocol goes into the repurchase and distribution of the MUTM token. The token, in turn, gets distributed throughout the ecosystem, ensuring constant buying force and an immediate link between the platform and the token. In this regard, the purpose and high potential offered by the cryptocurrency, link it with real functionality. Phase 6 Presale has over 95% sold at $0.035, reflecting $19.02 million in sales to 18,250+ investors. With its dual lending functionality, reward-generating mtToken, and high usability, Mutuum Finance is the best crypto to invest in the early investor space. Join the official presale to secure the new crypto coin before Phase 7 starts at $0.04.

In line with Bitcoin’s price recovery, these investment funds also ended a bleeding month of losses on a moderately positive note. Bitcoin Spot ETFs Begin Recovery From Red November According to the ETF tracking site, SoSoValue , Bitcoin Spot ETFs registered a net inflow of $70.05 million in the last week of November, to provide relief to a rather draining month. Notably, this reported figure represents the first positive netflow in four weeks, stretching since the last week of October. In analyzing individual ETF performance, BlackRock’s IBIT, valued at $51.55 per share, was largely unaffected by Bitcoin’s recovery, resulting in net outflows of $137.01 million. However, its cumulative net inflow still stands at $62.57 billion, retaining its status as the undisputed market leader. Other ETFs that also remained under bearish influence include Bitwise’s BITB and VanEck’s HODL, with aggregate outflows of $18.10 million and $36.95 million, respectively. On the other hand, the majority of the positive momentum came from Fidelity’s FBTC, which registered net inflows valued at around $230.44 million. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s duo GBTC and BTC, alongside Ark Invest’s ARKB, recorded a combined $31.65 million in net deposits. Other funds such as Invesco’s BTCO, Valkyrie’s BRRR, Franklin Templeton’s EZBC, WisdomTree’s BTCW, and Hashdex’s DEFI recorded no significant netflow. Following this recent modest recovery, the Bitcoin spot ETFs closed November with total net outflows of $3.48 billion. At the time of writing, the cumulative total net inflow for these investment funds stands at $57.71 billion, while total net assets are valued at $119.39 billion, representing 6.56% of the Bitcoin market cap. Ethereum ETFs Not Excluded From Recovery Party According to SoSoValue, the Ethereum Spot ETFs also experienced a market rebound following three consecutive weeks of outflows. Over the last week, these products attracted net deposits of $312.62 million to bring the cumulative total net inflows to $12.94 billion. BlackRock’s ETHA and Fidelity’s FETH accounted for the majority of this positive netflow with net deposits of $257.18 million and $45.3 million, respectively. The Ethereum Spot ETFs now boast of total net assets of $19.14 billion, representing 5.19% of ETH’s market cap. At press time, Ethereum continues to trade at $2,991 after a minor 1.64% decline in the past day. Meanwhile, Bitcoin remains in consolidation around $90,840.",ETF|bitcoin|Bitcoin Spot ETFs|BlackRock IBIT|Ethereum|Ethereum Spot ETFs|Fidelity FBTC|Sosovalue,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-30 09:30:22

Indeed, IBIT’s returns have soared despite persistent turbulence in the broader Bitcoin ( BTC ) market. At the close of the last session, IBIT was trading at $51.55, reflecting a 106.45% gain from its launch price. This means the ETF has more than doubled since hitting the market in early 2024. IBIT ETF all-time price chart. Source: Google Finance For early investors , the returns are impressive. In this case, a $100 investment at launch, when the ETF traded around $24, would now be worth approximately $206.45. Notably, IBIT’s performance has closely mirrored Bitcoin’s broader momentum but has also benefited from strong institutional adoption. IBITs’ success BlackRock’s expanding crypto strategy, supported by consistent inflows earlier this year, has helped the ETF cement its role as a gateway for traditional investors seeking exposure to digital assets. Indeed, the success of IBIT has had a direct impact on the world’s largest investment manager. To this end, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETFs have quickly emerged as a top revenue source, surprising many given the firm manages over 1,400 ETFs and $13.4 trillion in assets. The US-listed spot Bitcoin ETF has amassed $70 billion in assets in just 341 days, generating an estimated $245 million in annual fees. At the same time, IBIT now holds more than 3% of Bitcoin’s total supply, while BlackRock’s Strategic Income Opportunities Portfolio has boosted its stake in the ETF by 14%, signaling confidence in continued growth.

The statement came from Cristiano Castro, Business Development Director at BlackRock Brazil. This data is noteworthy considering that BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, manages more than 1,400 ETFs and has total assets exceeding $13.4 trillion. Speaking to Brazilian media at the Blockchain Conference in São Paulo, Castro described the growth of Bitcoin ETFs as a “big surprise.” He said allocations to the company's BTC ETFs, including US-based IBIT and Brazil's IBIT39, are approaching nearly $100 billion. “We were optimistic at launch, but we didn't expect this level of growth,” he said. Launched in January 2024, the US spot Bitcoin ETF IBIT reached $70 billion in assets in just 341 days, becoming the fastest ETF in history to surpass this threshold. According to SoSoValue data, the fund's current net assets are $70.7 billion. Related News: Altcoins with the Most Buybacks in the Last 30 Days Revealed In its first year, net inflows exceeded $52 billion, surpassing all ETFs launched in the last decade. IBIT also generated approximately $245 million in annual trading fee revenue as of October 2025. BlackRock's global distribution network and institutional demand following regulatory approval for spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US are cited as key drivers of IBIT's rapid rise. The fund currently holds over 3% of the Bitcoin supply. Following IBIT, the company has also launched various BTC-related products in various countries. Castro also addressed the recent outflows from Bitcoin funds, stating that this volatility was natural. He noted that individual investors react more quickly to price drops, saying, “ETFs are highly liquid and powerful instruments. They were created to manage flows.” *This is not investment advice.

Key Takeaways: Hester Peirce says crypto self-custody is a basic freedom and people should not be forced to rely on intermediaries to hold their assets. She argues that financial privacy should be the default and not treated as evidence of wrongdoing. Her comments come as crypto legislation is delayed and ETFs pull some investors away from self-custody. Speaking on The Rollup podcast , Peirce described herself as a “freedom maximalist” and argued that people should not be forced to rely on intermediaries to control their assets. “Of course people can hold their own assets,” she said, questioning why that principle should even be controversial in a country founded on personal liberty. SEC’s Peirce Says Financial Privacy Should Be the Default Peirce also took aim at what she described as a cultural shift toward treating financial privacy as a red flag. Instead, she said, privacy should be the default, not a sign of wrongdoing. “If you want to keep your transactions private, the assumption shouldn’t be that you’re doing something illegal,” she said. “It should be the opposite.” Her remarks arrive as uncertainty continues around US crypto legislation. According to Senator Tim Scott, the Digital Asset Market Structure Clarity Act, a bill that addresses self-custody, anti-money laundering rules and the classification of digital assets, has been delayed until 2026 .

Peirce’s comments also come at a time when self-custody itself faces competition from Wall Street products. Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have made crypto easier to access for traditional investors, drawing some users away from holding coins directly in private wallets. Self-Custodied Bitcoin Falls for First Time in 15 Years Dr. Martin Hiesboeck, head of research at Uphold, said the industry is seeing the “first decline in self-custodied Bitcoin in 15 years,” as investors shift into ETFs for tax advantages and convenience. The introduction of in-kind redemptions earlier this year allows ETF holders to swap crypto for shares without triggering a taxable event, a benefit that directly competes with personal wallets. The real reason for all the whale movements out of self-custody is simple: taxes. We are witnessing the first decline in self-custodied Bitcoin in 15 years.

He claimed that ETFs offer a convenient alternative, reducing the complexities and risks associated with holding private wallet keys. One of the key reasons behind PlanB’s decision is the security challenge of managing private keys. “Not having to hassle with keys gives me peace of mind,” he stated. The announcement sparked backlash from purists who see centralized custody as a betrayal of Bitcoin’s founding principles.

Key Takeaways: Santiment says low stablecoin yields show the crypto market is not overheated and Ether could test the $3,200 level. Yield data between 3.9% and 4.5% suggests leverage remains muted, reducing the risk of a near-term market top. Technical signals and $312.6M in Ether ETF inflows point to returning confidence after a sharp recent decline. In a report published Saturday , the firm said muted stablecoin yields point to room for further price gains, with Ether potentially revisiting the key $3,200 level. “Currently, yields are low, around 4%. This indicates the market has not reached a major top and could still push higher,” Santiment said, noting that Ether was trading near $3,001 at the time of the report. That target implies an upside of nearly 7% from recent prices around $2,990, based on CoinMarketCap data. Low Stablecoin Yields Signal Crypto Market Isn’t Overheated Santiment tracks yields from major crypto lending protocols, where interest rates often reflect the amount of leverage flowing into the market. According to the firm, stablecoin returns are sitting between 3.9% and 4.5%, a range that suggests borrowing demand remains subdued. Historically, spikes in yields have coincided with speculative excess and trend reversals, making today’s comparatively low levels a sign that risk-taking is still measured. The outlook follows a difficult month for Ether, which slid more than 21% over the past 30 days as part of a broader digital asset selloff. The downturn accelerated after a steep $19 billion liquidation event on Oct. 10, which was compounded by renewed trade uncertainty following US President Donald Trump’s announcement of sweeping tariffs on Chinese imports. https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1994468121982148872?s=20 Technical indicators are also starting to lean constructive. Crypto analyst Matthew Hyland said the ETH-BTC weekly chart is approaching a “bullish ribbon flip” for the first time since mid-2020, a signal that in past cycles has marked the start of extended outperformance against Bitcoin. Flows into exchange-traded products are adding to the shift in tone. Spot Ether ETFs reversed course this week, drawing $312.6 million in net inflows after three weeks of sustained withdrawals, suggesting fresh interest from institutional buyers. Santiment Improves as Sell-Off Eases Sentiment across the market is improving as well. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , which spent 18 days in “extreme fear” in November, recently climbed back into the “fear” zone, hinting that panic-driven selling may be easing. Seasonal patterns may also come into play. December has delivered an average return of nearly 7% for Ether since 2013, according to CoinGlass. Still, with both October and November underperforming typical trends this year, traders remain cautious about leaning too heavily on historical playbooks alone. As reported, ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood has forecasted that the liquidity squeeze hitting crypto and AI markets will reverse within weeks , driven by three Federal Reserve policy shifts expected before year-end. Her firm continues aggressively buying crypto equities during the downturn, deploying over $93 million in a single day this week across beaten-down digital asset stocks.

According to RBC , National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) Chairman Timur Suleimenov announced the initiative would draw from the bank’s foreign exchange reserves rather than the country’s sovereign wealth fund, while cautioning that recent crypto market volatility requires a measured approach before committing capital. The announcement comes as Bitcoin has declined 17% since early November, dropping from $110,000 to $81,000 and wiping $500 billion from total crypto market capitalization. Suleimenov told reporters the bank would “ let the dust settle ” before making investment decisions. He emphasized the difficulty of achieving profitability amid the sharp downturn. National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) Chairman Timur Suleimenov. | Source: Kazinform International News Agency Central Bank Adopts Cautious Stance on Digital Asset Exposure The NBK has already established an investment portfolio containing high-tech stocks and financial instruments linked to digital assets within its gold and foreign exchange reserves. Despite having frameworks in place, Suleimenov stressed the regulator would not rush deployment until favorable opportunities emerge. “ Until good investment opportunities emerge, we won’t rush these decisions, ” Suleimenov said at a November 28 briefing. The chairman had previously told Bloomberg in early November that Kazakhstan planned to create a national crypto fund worth up to $1 billion , clarifying the bank would invest “ cautiously ” through exchange-traded funds and crypto company stocks rather than direct token holdings. This measured approach contrasts with the broader ambitions articulated by President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, who directed the creation of a state-backed crypto reserve fund through the National Bank’s Investment Corporation. The president called for accumulating strategic reserves of “ promising assets ” and announced up to $1 billion in funding for technological growth programs spanning high-tech and fintech sectors. Kazakhstan Builds Multi-Layered Crypto Infrastructure The central bank’s investment plans build on Kazakhstan’s rapidly expanding digital asset ecosystem, which launched its first national crypto reserve in September through the Alem Crypto Fund. Established by the Ministry of Artificial Intelligence and Digital Development and managed by Qazaqstan Venture Group, the fund selected BNB as its initial holding through a strategic partnership with Binance Kazakhstan. Deputy Prime Minister Zhaslan Madiyev described the fund as designed to become “ a reliable instrument for major investors and a key foundation for digital state reserves. “ TLDR: Kazakhstan buys #BNB Kazakhstan ""national"" crypto reserve – Alem Crypto Fund – buys #BNB for long-term holding. https://t.co/ZbLNbuLvpG (Photo from 2022, new photo coming soon…) pic.twitter.com/2aoz33e328 — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) September 29, 2025 BNB currently has a market capitalization exceeding $120 billion and serves as the native cryptocurrency of BNB Chain for processing transactions, paying network fees, and participating in governance. Kazakhstan approved stablecoin payments for regulatory fees in September during Astana Finance Days, with the Astana Financial Services Authority establishing a framework allowing participants to settle fees in U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins through licensed Digital Asset Service Providers. The country also launched Central Asia’s first spot Bitcoin ETF in August, with the physically-backed Fonte Bitcoin ETF trading on the Astana International Exchange, using BitGo Trust for cold storage. Enforcement Actions Target Illegal Operations Amid Expansion While advancing institutional crypto adoption, Kazakhstan has intensified crackdowns on unlicensed operations, shutting down 130 illegal crypto exchanges in October and seizing $16.7 million in virtual assets suspected of laundering criminal proceeds. Authorities uncovered 81 shadow cash-out groups with a combined turnover reaching 24 billion KZT ($43 million) in 2024. The enforcement actions follow Kazakhstan’s evolution from controlling 27% of global Bitcoin mining in 2021 after Chinese operations relocated, to just 4% by 2023 following grid strain and regulatory adjustments.

During the same period, President Tokayev announced “ CryptoCity ” in Alatau as a pilot zone for everyday crypto payments, featuring a crypto banking system providing exchange, storage, and transaction processing services while supporting anti-money laundering compliance. The digital tenge , the central bank’s digital currency, remains scheduled for full rollout by the end of this year as a third form of currency alongside cash and non-cash payments. However, the rollout remains uncertain this year.

55142233,https://cryptonews.com/?p=457939,1764496434,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/55142233.jpeg,Nasdaq Pledges Swift Push for SEC Approval of Tokenized Stocks,https://cryptonews.com/news/nasdaq-pledges-swift-push-for-sec-approval-of-tokenized-stocks/,"Nasdaq digital assets chief Matt Savarese announced the exchange has made its tokenized-stock proposal a top priority and will “ move as fast as we can ” with the SEC to secure approval. The proposal would allow trading of on-chain “ stock tokens ,” digital representations of publicly listed shares, under existing national market system rules. Speaking in a CNBC interview , Savarese emphasized that Nasdaq isn’t trying to upend the existing system but aims to bring tokenization into the mainstream responsibly under SEC oversight. “We’re not creating a new exotic instrument. The stock is the stock,” he said, stressing that investors would retain full rights and title as shareholders. The exchange filed its rule change application in September , seeking to permit listed equities and exchange-traded products to trade in tokenized form while maintaining the same investor protections and execution standards as traditional securities. Nasdaq Frames Tokenization as Evolution, Not Revolution The exchange’s approach centers on maintaining the current market structure while adding blockchain-based settlement options. “ The rules have existed for decades, and we don’t want to just completely rip out and upend the entire process, ” Savarese explained, noting that trades would continue flowing through Nasdaq’s order book under SEC rules and national market system oversight. Under the proposal, tokenized shares would carry the same rights as their underlying securities, including voting privileges and dividend rights. “ It’s fully fungible between the token and its traditional form, ” he said, explaining that clearing firms and the Depository Trust Company would process tokenized orders alongside conventional stocks under the same ticker symbols and CUSIP identifiers. The executive stressed that Nasdaq positions itself as “ the original innovator ” in market infrastructure evolution, comparing tokenization to the exchange’s earlier shift from paper-based to electronic trading. “ It’s evolutionary. It’s not really revolutionary, ” he said, describing the effort as bringing the ecosystem along gradually while ensuring investor-first principles remain paramount. SEC is developing a plan to enable stocks to trade like crypto on a blockchain, backed by Nasdaq, despite resistance from Wall Street incumbents. #Stock #Crypto #SEC https://t.co/A09i0i1JCi — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 30, 2025 Post-Trade Efficiency and Collateral Mobility Drive Near-Term Benefits Savarese outlined a phased timeline for tokenization benefits, with near-term gains focused on back-end processing improvements. Tokenized settlement would create process efficiencies immediately, though the exchange plans to maintain seamless integration with existing member firm systems before pursuing faster settlement speeds. Beyond settlement, enhanced collateral mobility emerged as a critical medium-term advantage. “ Being able to take that equity, put it into a collateral pool, allow folks to be able to move that asset instantaneously can help along the lines of making sure that you have capital efficiency, ” Savarese said, noting this would eliminate the need to overcollateralize positions. Longer-term applications extend to corporate actions, proxy voting, and programmable smart contract functionality. “ You start to get the programmable nature of what blockchain is and smart contracts are intended for, ” he explained. Nasdaq’s acquisition of Calypso through its Adenza deal provides the exchange with what Savarese called “ the gold standard ” in collateral management software, now integrated with blockchain rails to support tokenized asset movement. Regulatory Path Forward Remains Central Focus The exchange has entered the public comment period following its September filing, with responses closed by mid-October. “ We’ll move as fast as we can with the SEC and make sure that we try to push this through, ” Savarese said, expressing confidence that tokenization represents a priority topic for the current administration. While declining to provide specific approval timelines given uncertainties, including recent government disruptions, the executive emphasized Nasdaq’s collaborative approach. “ We’re not looking at kind of upending the system. We want everyone to come along with us for that ride and bring tokenization more into the mainstream, but we want to do it in that responsible investor-led way, ” he said. SEC Chair Paul Atkins has directed the agency to develop clear rules on digital asset classification. At the same time, Commissioner Hester Peirce recently affirmed the regulator’s willingness to work with tokenization firms, provided they maintain full disclosure about asset characteristics. Nasdaq already filed SR-NASDAQ-2025-072 to list tokenized equities/ETPs, and the SEC’s public-comment window closes Oct 14. Commissioner Hester Peirce also said today the agency is willing to work with tokenization efforts—signaling tangible follow-through, not just chatter. — Briefing Block (@briefing_block_) September 30, 2025 Nasdaq’s filing comes as global tokenized stock markets have surged past $465 million in market value, with monthly transfer volumes climbing more than 280% according to RWA.xyz data. Source: RWA[dot]xyz Despite momentum, resistance persists from traditional financial institutions. The World Federation of Exchanges has urged regulators to tighten oversight of tokenized equities , warning that blockchain-based products may “ mimic ” traditional stocks without conferring shareholder rights or market safeguards that characterize regulated securities trading.

Presently, hashprice, the metric that measures expected miner profitability per unit of computer power, sits at record lows. According to a report from CoinWarz, Bitcoin’s next mining difficulty adjustment is expected to occur at block 927,369 at around 12:09:34 AM UTC, increasing the difficulty marginally from 149.30 trillion to 149.80 trillion. The latest adjustment, which occurred on Thursday, saw the difficulty drop from 152.2 trillion to 149.3 million, a move that resulted in an average block time of about 9.97 minutes, putting it slightly below the 10-minute mark. Bitcoin mining difficulty predicted to rise next month Despite the recent drop in Bitcoin mining difficulty , hash price is presently close to $38.3 petahashes per second (PH/s) per day. According to Hashrate Index, the figure is up from the record low of below $35 PH/s that was recorded on November 21. For context, miners need the $40 PH/s as a break-even level, which is also coincidentally the point where they have to de-energize their machines or continue their operations. In addition, the drop in hash price has also been affecting the mining supply chain, with hardware providers filling fewer orders to struggling miners and taking a hit on any BTC-denominated sales due to the drop in price after the October market crash. Mining hardware manufacturers like Bitdeer have turned to self-mining to offset the shortfall in demand for mining machines. The high capital expenditures and the slim profit margins have seen miners rethink their operations. As computational power and electricity needed to mine blocks continue to rise as a result of the Bitcoin halving that occurs every four years, miners are now shifting into the AI data and compute business. According to reports, companies that have made the switch have generated billions of dollars in revenue. A typical example is Cipher Mining, with the firm inking a $5.5 billion deal with tech giant Amazon to provide compute power to Amazon Web Services over the next 15 years. Mining industry faces growing challenges The mining industry continues to face growing challenges , including regulatory bans or restrictions, increasing energy costs, and geopolitical tensions between the United States and China that threaten to disrupt critical equipment supply chains. Last month, the Abu Dhabi Agriculture and Food Safety Authority (ADAFSA) announced a ban on using agricultural land for crypto mining. Violators of the directive are also set to face fines of up to 100,000 AED. In addition, the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has also started a probe into mining manufacturer Bitmain, which has its base in China. The agency is trying to determine whether its machines can be remotely accessed or used to commit espionage. Last year, US Senator Elizabeth Warren, one of the most vocal crypto critics, suggested that ASICs could be used for spying on the United States military bases and sensitive national defense installations. “They’re loud, they’re hot, and they suck up a ton of electricity, which can crash the power grid,” she added. Meanwhile, Bitmain remains the leading manufacturer of ASICs used to mine proof-of-work (PoW) digital assets like Bitcoin. According to a University of Cambridge report, the company commands about 80% of the total market share. Sanctions, tariffs, or restrictions imposed on the company by the US could trigger a supply chain for the crypto mining industry, which relies heavily on Bitmain.

As the market faces volatility and uncertainty, tokens with practical applications will stand out. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , an ETH-based DeFi token, is gaining popularity among retail buyers. Its presale will allow investors to participate early and secure discounted tokens. With live features planned at launch, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will attract those seeking reliable DeFi exposure while navigating broader market uncertainty and a crypto crash. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Presale Momentum and Early Participation Mutuum Finance is developing a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol enabling crypto lending and borrowing through smart contracts. It offers both peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer models, supports variable and stable interest rates, and rewards users with its native token, MUTM. The platform is non-custodial, audited, and aims to grow via liquidity incentives. Halborn Security is conducting an independent audit of Mutuum Finance’s lending and borrowing contracts. The development phase is complete, and the finalized code is now undergoing detailed formal analysis to validate its security and robustness. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a total planned supply of 4 billion tokens. Across all presale phases, it has raised approximately $19 million and over 18,200 holders have participated in presale. Phase 6 is now priced at $0.035, with 95% of allocated tokens claimed. The next phase price will increase 15% to $0.040, creating a very tight window for buyers. Delay may cost them a quick 15% as price may go up anytime now. There is good news for investors as they are now able to buy MUTM using cards without any limits, making participation simple and fast. This is the last chance to secure discounted MUTM before the price increases. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Is Becoming Favorite Firstly, its platform and token is expected to launch simultaneously, generating early momentum. A working product will be available on day one, allowing users to interact with live lending and borrowing modules immediately. This synchronized rollout will attract Tier-1 and Tier-2 exchange attention. Once listed, MUTM will gain visibility and trading activity, while investors will be able to stake mtTokens for rewards, creating organic demand from the start. Secondly, the token’s value will come from platform activity rather than hype. Every feature — lending, borrowing, staking, and buybacks — will drive real utility. The roadmap includes an over-collateralized stablecoin system, allowing users to mint a $1-pegged stablecoin using ETH, SOL, or AVAX. Each mint and repayment transaction will generate transactional demand for MUTM. As the protocol expands, these features will increase utility and engagement, establishing MUTM as a core asset in the ecosystem and supporting ongoing demand long after listing. Finally, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will implement a buy-and-distribute mechanism. Part of the revenue from platform activity will buy back MUTM tokens from the open market. These tokens will be redistributed as rewards to mtToken stakers. This cycle will provide consistent buy pressure while rewarding long-term users. The more the platform is used, the higher the revenue and the more tokens will be redistributed to the community. Platform Launch and Protocol Highlights Mutuum Finance (MUTM) shared through its official X handle that the V1 release of its protocol is scheduled for deployment on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. This first release will bring the platform’s core modules online, including the liquidity pool, the mtToken and debt token structures, and an automated liquidator bot designed to protect collateral positions and maintain operational stability. During this stage, users will have access to lending, borrowing, and collateralization using ETH or USDT. Releasing V1 on the testnet gives the community an early opportunity to interact with the protocol before the mainnet launch. This staged rollout promotes transparency, encourages early participation, and helps the team gather meaningful insights for further refinement. As more users experiment with the testnet features, interest in the ecosystem may expand, contributing to long-term confidence and demand for the MUTM token. Conclusion and Giveaway Phase 6 of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is almost sold out, and the next phase will see a 15% price increase. So it is the perfect time to take your positions for MUTM now as delay may cost you a regret as 15% value gain is instant in line can be seen. Retail investors are drawn to MUTM for its ETH-based security, DeFi utility, and early-adopter rewards. With presale momentum, dual lending features, and a working platform at launch, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will continue to become a favorite among buyers seeking the best cryptocurrency coin to buy this season.

He shared a chart of the XRP/BTC pair showing the performance since the flash crash on October 10 . This massive liquidation event saw XRP drop to $1.52, its lowest level in 2025. It created immediate uncertainty across markets. Traders rushed to adjust positions as liquidity thinned. Volatility stayed elevated for days. The XRP/BTC chart he posted shows how the pair moved after that moment and how the market absorbed the shock. XRP vs BTC since 10/10 liquidation pic.twitter.com/Tmr63lSZz8 — Zach Rector (@ZachRector7) November 28, 2025 Price Action in the XRP/BTC Pair The chart begins in mid-October and shows a period of tight but active movement. XRP held a narrow band against BTC for several sessions. Small swings came quickly as buyers tested momentum. Sellers tried to keep control but failed to extend the decline . The pair then moved through late October with several sharp reversals. That pattern signaled a shift in control. In early November, the pair continued to move in a contained channel. XRP showed resilience as BTC posted mixed sessions. Traders saw repeated attempts to push the pair lower, with a notable attempt around November 5. However, XRP remained strong. The mid-month section of the chart displays a clear sequence of higher lows. This behavior supported the view that the October crash had cleared weak positions . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What’s Next for XRP? The late November rally created the strongest signal in the chart. XRP broke above the earlier range and printed a fast move toward 0.00002550 BTC. That level placed the pair near a short-term high. However, a pullback followed. The pair now trades around 0.00002398 BTC. The retracement does not resemble the disorder seen on October 10, suggesting this move is temporary as buyers reset their positions. The data shows XRP gaining stability after a severe test. Traders who monitor relative strength see that XRP defended support more effectively than expected. The chart suggests that pressure from the October liquidation event faded. BTC continues to dominate the market, but XRP is holding its ground. If the pair maintains current support, buyers may attempt another move toward the recent high. The absence of heavy selling pressure supports that possibility. The market will face new tests as volatility returns, but the chart suggests a constructive setup for XRP with a good chance of a short-term rally .

According to Bloomberg Intelligence senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone, Bitcoin could drop to $50,000, citing a confluence of macro forces, he said in an X post on November 28. In outlining his outlook, McGlone noted that Bitcoin’s slide relative to gold has accelerated, reinforcing a structural shift toward defensive positioning. With gold breaking record highs and absorbing haven flows, Bitcoin’s weakening performance against the metal has amplified downside momentum, raising the probability of a retest of its long-term $50,000 pivot, and potentially much worse if current trends persist. Christmas Grinch Bitcoin Gaining Bear Tracks: Does Gold Get It? Top factors that support Bitcoin revisiting its $50,000 pivot are normal reversion, record-setting gold, buried stock-market volatility and the unlimited supply of crypto companions. Will the risk-asset leading… pic.twitter.com/Knxk2Dx1Ru — Mike McGlone (@mikemcglone11) November 28, 2025 A key concern is the backdrop of compressed stock-market volatility and a broad risk-off rotation. The strategist noted that equity markets have remained relatively calm, but he warns this tranquility may be masking deeper cracks. His analysis shows that historically, the S&P 500 often follows Bitcoin when it drops below its 50-week moving average (MA). Currently, both Bitcoin and the S&P 500 sit beneath these key trendlines, signaling rising risk across major assets. Past breaks, like in 2018, during the 2020 pandemic, and in 2022’s bear market, saw equities soon mirror Bitcoin’s decline, suggesting the current alignment could again drag stocks lower. Adding pressure is what the strategist calls the “unlimited supply” of crypto competitors, which continues to dilute market share and soften Bitcoin’s dominance during periods of stress. Combined with mean-reversion forces and deteriorating liquidity conditions, the environment resembles past deflationary phases in which Bitcoin suffered deep retracements. Bitcoin price analysis Indeed, McGlone’s warning comes as Bitcoin reclaimed the $90,000 resistance, which has now turned into a fragile support zone. By press time, the cryptocurrency was trading at $91,415, up almost 1% in the past 24 hours, while on the weekly timeline, the asset has rallied 6%. Despite these gains, Bitcoin’s technical structure leans bearish. The 50-day SMA sits at $103,001 and the 200-day SMA at $104,439, placing the current price well below both key trend markers. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold This alignment confirms a sustained loss of upward momentum and reinforces a broader downtrend, as traders typically view prices trading beneath both SMAs as a sign that sellers remain in control. The 14-day RSI stands at 40.50, hovering in neutral territory but leaning toward weakness.

Peirce, who is also the head of the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, has always been at the forefront of financial freedom. The SEC Commissioner made these known during an interview on The Roll Up podcast . “I’m a freedom maximalist,” Peirce said, noting that self-custody of digital assets is a fundamental human right. “Why should I have to be forced to go through someone else to hold my assets? It baffles me that in this country, which is so premised on freedom, that would even be an issue — of course, people can hold their own assets,” the SEC Commissioner added. SEC Commissioner reiterates stance on crypto self-custody During the interview, Peirce added that online financial privacy should be the standard. “It has become the presumption that if you want to keep your transactions private, you’re doing something wrong, but it should be exactly the opposite presumption,” she said. Her comments are also coming after news that the Digital Asset Market Structure Clarity Act , a crypto market structure bill that includes several provisions, will be delayed until 2026. The news was shared on blogging platform X (formerly Twitter) by Senator Tim Scott. “Our crypto market structure work is about empowering the American people – including single moms like the one who raised me. We’re aiming to markup bipartisan legislation next month and get it to President Trump’s desk to keep America economically dominant for decades,” he said. The bill is expected to include asset taxonomy, anti-money laundering regulations, and provisions for self-custody. Over the past few months, many large Bitcoin whales and long-term holders have been shifting how they hold assets, pivoting from self-custody to ETFs to reap the tax benefits and hassle-free management of owning digital assets in an investment vehicle. The development was brought to the mainstream media by Martin Hiesbock, head of blockchain and crypto research at financial services platform Uphold. Large Bitcoin holders shift holdings to ETFs Hiesbock claimed that the movement of large amounts of Bitcoin into ETFs marks the first time in more than 15 years that there has been a significant decline in the number of self-custodied BTC. “Another nail in the coffin of the original crypto spirit,” he wrote. He added that the “not your keys, not your coins” ethos that has always accompanied digital assets has given rise to a more traditional approach that centers on compliance and financial optimization. “The shift is driven by the convenience and significant tax benefits offered by ETFs, as well as the ability for major investors to manage their wealth through existing financial advisers and access broader investment/lending services,” Hiesboeck said. Leading the charge is BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which has already seen over $3 billion worth of Bitcoin from whales, according to Robbie Mitchnick, head of digital assets at BlackRock. In addition, popular Bitcoin analyst and investor PlanB announced that he was transferring his Bitcoin to ETFs to alleviate the hassle of private key management. PlanB, the developer of the BTC stock-to-flow model, announced in February, noting that he made the decision so he could manage his holdings more like equities and bonds, without the complexities of self-custody. “I guess I am not a maxi anymore,” PlanB said in an X post at the time.

Egrag Crypto, known for his long-standing bullish stance on XRP, released a new technical update that breaks down the future outlook for the cryptocurrency into three straightforward outcomes. The chart accompanying his analysis shows XRP trading around the $2.20 region, sitting just above an important Fib support level but still wrestling with momentum, with the monthly candle about to close. Related Reading: 320 Ether On The Move: Bhutan Ramps Up Its Staking Game XRP Must Close Above $2.60 To Keep Bullish Momentum Intact Egrag’s first decisive level is at $2.60, which matches with the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level on the monthly chart. The analyst described a close above this region as bullish but the asset would not yet be fully clear of danger. The chart shows XRP repeatedly testing this price level in the first half of the year before breaking above it in July. However, the most recent breakdown in Q2 2025 has now put the price level in focus again. The analysis becomes more aggressive once price action breaks above $3.40. EGRAG identified this as the 0.888 Fibonacci level, one of the final retracement zones. According to him, a close above this level confirms a super-bullish macro breakout, which he summarized with the phrase “we are so back.” The chart reinforces this idea by showing a tight compression beneath this upper 0.888 Fib cluster, and that a decisive breakout could lead to a rapid move into new all-time high prices if there’s enough buying pressure. XRP Price Chart. Source: @egragcrypto On X A Close Below 21 EMA Would Break Bullish Structure The downside scenario in Egrag’s breakdown is equally straightforward. He warned that a close below the 21-month EMA would mean a severe failure of the bullish trend structure. His wording was intentionally harsh, noting that such a breakdown would mean “we are f**ked, no sugar-coating it.” The chart shows the 21 EMA currently sitting around the $1.83-$1.90 price zone, forming the final major support on the monthly timeframe. Losing this level would drag XRP back into a deeper corrective zone and finally undo most of the price advancement made this year. A significant development showed up towards the end of the week that aligns with the bullish continuation Egrag outlined. 21Shares confirmed that its US Spot XRP ETF, which is listed under the ticker TOXR, has received SEC approval and will officially launch on Monday.

The cryptocurrency held a strong market structure following several days of price consolidation. XRP price chart, Source: CoinMarketCap Technical indicators pointed toward continued strength in the near term. Market analysts noted that XRP's ability to defend the $2.00 support level demonstrated solid underlying demand. The broader cryptocurrency market showed signs of recovery, with Bitcoin trading at around $91,326 and Ethereum $3,007 at press time. Institutional Capital Flows Into XRP Products ETF inflows reached approximately $666.6 million in November within just two weeks of launch. The 21Shares U.S. spot XRP ETF will begin trading on Monday under the ticker symbol TOXR. This marked a significant milestone for institutional access to the digital asset. Major financial firms backed their XRP ETF offerings. Grayscale and Franklin Templeton both supported products tracking the cryptocurrency's performance. The seven-day period saw XRP climb 16% as institutional participation accelerated. Large holders increased their positions substantially. Wallets containing over one billion XRP added approximately 150 million tokens since November 25. At current prices, this represented roughly $330 million in new capital allocation. The whale accumulation suggested confidence among sophisticated investors. Technical Setup Points to Higher Prices The current price structure remained constructive for bulls. XRP traded firmly above the critical $2.00 support zone, which buyers defended throughout recent sessions. This level served as a foundation for the next potential leg higher. The MACD indicator showed narrowing lines near the centerline. This pattern typically preceded increased volatility in either direction. However, the price action suggested upward movement remained more likely given recent momentum. The Relative Strength Index registered around 52, indicating balanced market conditions. This mid-range reading left substantial room for appreciation before reaching overbought territory. Traders viewed this as favorable for sustained gains. Price targets came into focus as momentum built. The immediate resistance sat at $2.40, followed by $2.60 as the next key level.

By 2028, CRO could reach a maximum value of $0.8337, with an average trading price of $0.7410. Cronos is expected to reach a maximum level of $2.56 in 2031. Cronos (CRO) is the native cryptocurrency token of the cronos chain, a decentralized, open-source blockchain developed by the Crypto.com payment, trading, and financial services company. CRO aims to power the next generation of decentralized crypto assets and applications, serving as a utility token. And enable real-time, low-cost transactions globally. Cronos cross-bridge mainnet beta suggests a bright future for CRO. This feature aims to improve interoperability between significant blockchain ecosystems, potentially increasing CRO’s attractiveness to developers and users. CRO’s recent performance reflects robust market sentiment and confidence. These factors, combined, present Cronos as a compelling investment opportunity within the dynamic crypto market, thereby increasing the demand for CRO. Eminem’s involvement comes as Crypto.com has been actively expanding its visibility through various high-profile partnerships, including those with actor Matt Damon, major sports teams, and even Trump Media. In this Cronos price prediction, we’ll focus on exploring the future market trends of CRO, its current price momentum, and its past performance, using in-depth technical analysis and a price prediction model. Overview Cryptocurrency Cronos Token CRO Price $0.1070 Market Capitalization $4.56B Trading Volume (24-hour) $28.76M Circulating Supply 36.1B CRO All-time High $0.9698 Nov 24, 2021 All-time Low $0.01149 Dec 17, 2018 24-h High $0.1092 24-h Low $0.1063 Cronos Price Prediction: Technical Analysis Metric Value Price Volatility (30-day variation) 13.25% 50-Day SMA $0.1363 14-Day RSI 40.56 Sentiment Bearish Green Days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $0.1418 Price Prediction $0.1172 (+7.44%) Cronos price analysis: CRO of value holds steady near the $0.107 zone CRO remains confined to a narrow price range, staying between $0.1063 and $0.1092, signaling limited volatility and no clear direction. Strong resistance caps upside repeated failures at $0.109, showing steady selling pressure that blocks upward movement. Key support holds firm, buyers continue to defend $0.106, making it the critical level preventing further downside. On November 30, 2025, Cronos trades near $0.1079 after a slight 0.07% dip over the past 24 hours. The token trades between $0.1063 and $0.1092, showing limited volatility as price action stayed tight. CRO remains far below its $0.9698 all-time high from November 2021, reflecting prolonged market weakness. Cronos daily price chart: CRO holds steady with $0.106 acting as key daily support The daily chart showed CRO holding a flat structure around $0.107, with price hovering near the midpoint of its recent range. Momentum remained neutral as neither buyers nor sellers failed to take control. Several attempts to break above $0.109 were rejected, confirming strong resistance and steady overhead supply. CRO/USDT Chart: TradingView The $0.106 level continued to act as key support, marked by repeated rebounds on the daily timeframe. Low volume pointed to reduced participation and ongoing indecision. CRO remained stuck in a neutral-to-weak pattern, unable to form higher highs or higher lows as the range tightened. Cronos 4-hour price chart: CRO faces firm resistance at $0.109 On the 4-hour chart, CRO displayed a slight downward leaning but remained largely range-bound around the $0.107 area. Price trades between $0.1063 and $0.1092 boundaries, showing no clear breakout attempt. Sellers continued to respond near the $0.108–$0.109 band, preventing continuation of upward momentum. This level acted as immediate resistance, forming a short-term barrier that the market failed to clear in consecutive sessions. CRO/USDT Chart: TradingView The chart illustrated repeated rebounds from this area, but without strong follow-through from buyers. The market structure suggested CRO could remain in this holding pattern unless strong volume re-enters the market. Short-term bias was mildly bearish due to lower highs forming throughout the intraday sequence. Cronos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.1845 SELL SMA 5 $0.1558 SELL SMA 10 $0.1006 BUY SMA 21 $0.1146 SELL SMA 50 $0.1363 SELL SMA 100 $0.1791 SELL SMA 200 $0.1418 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.1256 SELL EMA 5 $0.1430 SELL EMA 10 $0.1725 SELL EMA 21 $0.1863 SELL EMA 50 $0.1702 SELL EMA 100 $0.1466 SELL EMA 200 $0.1283 SELL What to expect from Cronos? CRO is likely to remain within its current tight range unless stronger momentum develops. A close above $0.109 would be the first sign of renewed bullish interest, potentially opening room for a short-term recovery. If buyers fail to reclaim that level, price may continue drifting sideways as selling pressure persists near the upper boundary. On the downside, $0.106 remains the critical support to watch. A breakdown below this level could expose CRO to deeper weakness, especially if volume picks up on the move. For now, the market favors consolidation, with neither side showing enough strength to force a decisive breakout. Is Cronos a good investment? Cronos can be viewed as a moderate-risk asset, and whether it is a good investment depends on an investor’s risk tolerance, time horizon, and belief in the project’s long-term ecosystem growth. The token has shown extended weakness compared to its 2021 peak, which highlights its sensitivity to broader market cycles and shifts in demand. CRO’s value largely depends on the performance of the Cronos Chain, the adoption of its ecosystem, and the continued expansion of Crypto.com’s products and user base. While the project maintains active development and real-world utility through payment, DeFi, and Web3 applications, its price performance has remained subdued, reflecting limited momentum. Investors typically view CRO as a long-term speculative asset rather than a short-term momentum play. Anyone considering exposure should evaluate fundamentals, market conditions, and their own financial strategy before making a decision. This analysis is not financial advice, and independent research is essential before investing. Why Is Cronos (CRO) Down Today? The primary reasons for CRO’s muted performance today include consistent overhead resistance, lack of strong buying momentum, and a broader market environment characterized by cautious sentiment. Without new catalysts or heightened trading activity, the token is likely to continue drifting sideways in the short term. Market participants should watch key levels closely, particularly $0.106 support and $0.109 resistance, to anticipate potential shifts in price direction. Recent news Cronos completed its “Smarturn” upgrade on October 30, 2025, boosting EVM compatibility, scalability, and interoperability. The update added EIP-7702 smart accounts, integrated Go-Ethereum v1.15.11 (with Cancun/Prague opcodes), introduced eth_getBlockReceipts, and improved transaction speed through PriorityNonceMempool and AnteCache. With IBC v2 integration for faster cross-chain communication, Smarturn enhances DeFi efficiency, lowers gas costs, and strengthens Cronos’s role as a leading Ethereum-compatible layer-1 in the Crypto.com ecosystem. Will Cronos reach $0.5? Based on long-term forecasts, Cronos (CRO) is projected to reach $ 0.50 by 2027, potentially increasing its market capitalization as its ecosystem and user adoption continue to grow. Will Cronos reach $1? Projections for Cronos estimate it could reach $1 by 2029, driven by its expansion in DeFi, NFT integrations, and partnerships. Will Cronos reach $100? It is unlikely that Cronos’s price will reach $100, as this would require an extremely high market capitalization, surpassing the current CRO coin price prediction for the cryptocurrency sector. Does Cronos have an excellent long-term future? Cronos CRO holds promising long-term potential due to Crypto.com ’s ongoing innovations, such as DEX expansions, NFT integration, and metaverse applications, collectively enhancing CRO’s appeal and utility. These strategic initiatives, along with CRO’s liquidity, staking rewards, and network governance, position it as a solid investment for those with a long-term perspective, especially considering institutional adoption.

Hayes claimed that MON was “99% fail-safe” and argued that the project was “not even close” to Solana. Hon, however, defended Monad's differences in a statement, detailing both the project and the technology being developed. In his message to Hayes, Hon began by expressing his respect for his contributions to the cryptocurrency industry, and then pointed out that recent comments about the Monad may have been taken out of context. Following the ensuing criticism, he addressed the question, “Why is the Monad different?” one by one. According to Hon's statement, the salient features of Monad are summarized as follows: Monad's primary focus is speed. Hon noted that when users withdraw MON from Coinbase, their assets appear on the network within 1–2 seconds, a result of the newly developed architecture. Monad is built entirely from scratch in C++ and Rust, incorporating high-frequency trading (HFT)-style optimizations. Built on this architecture, the network, powered by 170 global validators, aims to deliver high speed while maintaining decentralization. Hon argued that Monad proves the contrary, challenging the prevailing assumption that blockchains must be centralized to be efficient. Unlike Layer 2 (L2) or data center chains, which rely on a single sequencer, Monad creates a “neutral, decentralized, and trustless infrastructure.” According to the founder, Monad's technical innovations include the new consensus mechanism MonadBFT, which is said to solve the tail forking problem; Async Execution, which increases efficiency by separating consensus and execution; a JIT compiler that compiles to native code; the new database MonadDb; the advanced block propagation system RaptorCast; and parallel execution. Hon noted that Ethereum is similarly working to transition to an async execution model, claiming that Monad offers industry-leading innovations. Related News: Altcoins with the Most Buybacks in the Last 30 Days Revealed Hon stated that the ecosystem is still at the beginning of the road, but new applications are being developed rapidly with young and aggressive teams, and that the Monad Foundation and Category Labs will continue to advance aggressively in research and development. Hon noted that MON was the first token listed on Coinbase's token sale platform, explaining that the sale was conducted using a “bottom-up” model to prevent whales from collecting the entire sale. He noted that this method aims to generate as broad participation as possible. At the end of his statement, Hon offered to send MON to Arthur Hayes and said, “Thank you again for your contributions, see you on the chain.” *This is not investment advice.

XRP’s higher-low formation, paired with strong upward momentum, underscores clear buyer dominance, especially as exchange supply plunges over 45% in just 60 days. This bullish structure signals that buyers are stepping in earlier with every dip, a classic sign of growing confidence and sustained demand. With market sentiment turning cautious across the broader crypto landscape, XRP’s ability to maintain rising lows and accelerating momentum highlights its relative strength and a decisive shift in favor of the bulls. Trader Rai highlights $2.20 as the decisive level that will determine whether XRP’s momentum turns into a full bullish continuation. Holding this retest zone would confirm the higher-low structure and show that buyers are confidently absorbing sell pressure, keeping firm control of the trend. Holding above $2.20 positions XRP for a clean move toward its next major resistance levels, where the market’s reaction will reveal whether the bullish trend can sustain. A decisive breakout through these zones would strengthen the upward trajectory and draw in sidelined buyers waiting for confirmation. However, a drop below $2.20 could trigger short-term uncertainty, though the broader bullish structure remains intact unless a deeper breakdown unfolds. Therefore, Trader Rai’s analysis underscores a key takeaway that XRP’s price action reflects a market steadily gaining bullish strength. Momentum, structure, and critical support levels are aligning decisively in favor of continuation. As long as buyers defend the $2.20 zone, the odds of XRP pushing into higher resistance levels remain firmly on their side. In a market where confidence thrives on clear technical signals, XRP is displaying the disciplined bullish structure analysts expect in the early stages of a breakout. If current conditions persist, the asset appears poised for its next major leg upward—driven by buyers who show no signs of stepping back. XRP Supply on Exchanges Plunges Over 45% in 60 Days, Signaling a Major Market Shift Market expert Xaif Crypto acknowledges one of XRP’s largest supply contractions in years. Glassnode data shows centralized exchange balances have plunged over 45% in just 60 days, signaling a dramatic shift in holder behavior and potential for heightened price volatility. Exchange-held XRP has plummeted from 3.95 billion on September 21 to 2.6 billion by November 27, removing over 1.3 billion tokens from liquid supply. This sharp decline signals more than routine movement, it reflects a growing trend of investors moving XRP into self-custody, long-term holdings, or staking, highlighting rising confidence in the asset’s long-term value. Xaif Crypto stipulates that the sharp drop in XRP supply on exchanges signals rising accumulation and waning sell-side pressure. Withdrawn tokens are less likely to hit the market, a pattern that often precedes bullish moves. Xaif Crypto notes that such a supply shock can ‘tip the balance entirely toward buyers,’ especially if demand picks up. “Glassnode data shows whales and long-term holders are driving XRP accumulation, signaling a shift from speculative trading to strategic holding. With exchange supply down 45%, market attention is turning to volume, liquidity, and potential breakout patterns. This decline isn’t just a number, it reflects growing confidence and a market positioning itself for what could be a major move in the weeks ahead. Conclusion Notably, XRP’s market structure signals clear bullish control. Trader Rai notes that the higher-low formation and accelerating upward momentum keep buyers in command. Holding above the $2.20 retest zone could pave the way toward higher resistance levels, with growing momentum and favorable sentiment positioning XRP for a potential breakout that may set its next major trend. On the other hand, the 45% plunge in XRP supply on exchanges signals a decisive market shift. With more tokens moving into long-term holdings, sell-side pressure is easing, paving the way for potential bullish momentum. This trend reflects growing confidence in XRP’s long-term value and underscores how supply scarcity can drive price action. Monitoring exchange balances and accumulation trends will be crucial in anticipating XRP’s next major move.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-30 10:56:11

According to reports, the police were alerted to suspicious activities going on in the building, leading to a raid led by the Cyberabad police on the location. Indian police officers attached to the operation claimed that the telecallers were meticulously trained to mimic the Australian accent. The criminals also knew how to take on a high-pitched rising intonation at the end of their sentences by dropping the ‘r’ sound at the end of their words. Indian police busts fraud network targeting Australians According to the Indian police, the criminals had used their knowledge of the Australian accent to carve out a niche criminal market for themselves. The police claimed that they had siphoned funds from several victims halfway across the world. During the raid, which took place on Saturday, police arrested nine telecallers, including six who were from the West Bengal region. However, the Indian police claimed that two kingpins escaped and are still on the run. Investigators claimed that the masterminds behind the operation held several recruitments, prioritizing Indian students and others who had lived in Australia at one point in their lives. The criminals used their familiarity with the country to build credibility. The scammers also allegedly gained access to their victims’ banking details, using them to further their criminal activities. Once their operations have reached the point of extracting funds, they use the account details to collect funds. The Indian police claimed that they arrested several individuals, including Y Ganesh, M Chennai Keshav, M Mondal, Eazaz Ahmed, Samvit Roy, Shannik Benerjee, M Mallick, Silpi Samadder, and Kunal Singh, after searches in the buildings where the criminals carried out their illegal operations. Though the building was rented under the pretext of a legitimate call center, Indian police claimed that the criminals used it for their illegal activities. According to the Indian police, the sophisticated fraud targeted Australians, but they also focused their operations on other countries. The police claimed two individuals, Praveen and Prakash, coordinated with other unknown cybercriminals and armed themselves with the details of Australian residents. The police claimed that they used the details to contact unsuspecting victims, deploying a series of targeted acts to obtain funds under pretenses. Scammers target Australians with fake pop-ups In the past year, authorities claimed that the criminals have amassed between Rs. 8 crore and Rs. 10 crore. The police claimed that those currently working at the call centers were vigorously trained for years, getting them ready to be able to carry out the illicit acts and appear legitimate. This way, they dupe their victims with ease, and while reporting the crime, the victims would only report that they were scammed by someone operating in the country or a native of the country operating abroad. “This group sent fake pop-ups and emails to Australian citizens, falsely claiming that their computer was compromised. The pop-up contained a customer care phone number. When the victim called the number, the call was routed through the X-Lite application, which landed in the fake call center operated from Ayyappa society,” the Indian police said. They also claimed that the accused convinced the victims to allow remote access to their computers using the AnyDesk application. After gaining access to the computers, the suspects then move to their victims’ bank accounts and illegally move funds belonging to them to Australian bank accounts owned by Indian nationals who had previously resided in the country. The accused then routes the funds through digital assets and other local methods, moving them into India. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Most larger-cap altcoins are sluggish on a daily scale, aside from HYPE, AVAX, and ZEC – all of which have dumped hard since yesterday. BTC Taps $91K As mentioned above, the previous business week was quite painful for the primary cryptocurrency as it plunged below $81,000 for the first time since April. This meant that it had lost over $25,000 in just ten days. The bulls finally stepped up at this point and defended the $80,000 support. BTC started to recover some ground and quickly bounced to $84,000 last weekend. Its more impressive gains came during the business week when it initiated a leg up to $88,000 by Wednesday. Although that resistance held at first, the bulls managed to break through it that night, and bitcoin even jumped past $90,000 at the end of the week. Its local high came on Friday morning when it surged to just over $93,000. However, it couldn’t keep climbing , and the subsequent rejection drove it to the $90,000-$91,000 range, where it has been situated for the past 36 hours or so. Its market cap has increased to $1.820 trillion, while its dominance over the alts stands tall above 57% on CG. BTCUSD/30.11. Source: TradingView Weekly Gainers The weekly charts are quite impressive, given the rebound attempts by many altcoins. ETH and XRP are up by over 7% to $3,000 and $2.20, respectively. SOL has gained 5% and so has HYPE, even though it’s down by 6% in the past 24 hours. XMR, XLM, AVAX, SUI, SHIB, CC, and AAVE are also well in the green weekly. ZEC trades differently than most altcoins again, but this time in a painful manner. The privacy token has plunged by over 21% since last Sunday and now sits below $450. The total crypto market cap has added over $300 billion since last Friday’s low and is close to $3.2 trillion now. Cryptocurrency Market Overview Weekly.

With a market cap of $1.82tn trillion and nearly 20 million BTC in circulation, the asset remains at the center of macro debate, especially after Robert Kiyosaki reignited fears of a looming financial reset. Kiyosaki Flags Liquidity Shock Robert Kiyosaki, author of Rich Dad Poor Dad , has again sounded the alarm on what he believes is a brewing global crash. His warning lands at a moment when financial markets are struggling with what analysts call a “two-front liquidity squeeze”: Japan’s shifting fiscal posture and tightening conditions in US funding markets. Kiyosaki often frames Bitcoin as a safeguard against monetary erosion, but this time, the forces pressuring risk assets are more mechanical than philosophical. Money is simply leaving the system. Yen Unwind Creates Global Pressure Japan’s recent pivot, marked by heavier government spending and rising bond yields, has deepened yen weakness. The move is forcing investors to unwind years of carry trades, where cheap yen borrowing financed global risk-taking. As these leveraged positions collapse, liquidity thins across equities, bonds, and digital assets. Japan “Carry Trade” ended. Watch out below. Bubble Markets about to deflate. Standing by my mantra…buy gold, silver, Bitcoin, and Ethereum. More recommendations on how to get rich while world collapses will follow in future Tweets. Yes: you can get richer while world gets… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) November 29, 2025 For Bitcoin, this dynamic is double-edged. Near-term liquidity stress can weigh on prices, but long-term, the unwind may push investors toward decentralized assets as a hedge against fiscal instability. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technical Outlook Turns Constructive Despite macro headwinds, Bitcoin price prediction is showing early signs of stabilization. BTC has bounced sharply from the $81,028 support, an area that has consistently acted as a higher-timeframe demand zone since mid-2024. The daily chart shows a clean bullish reaction, with long lower wicks and follow-through buying. BTC is now testing the 20-day EMA at $92,800, which shifted into resistance after November’s breakdown. A decisive close above this level would mark Bitcoin’s first meaningful structural improvement in weeks. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Momentum is improving as the RSI climbs from 32 to 41, consistent with an early recovery phase. The chart structure hints at a rounded retest: a pullback toward $88,000, formation of a higher low, and a potential drive toward $98,279, which aligns with the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement. A reclaim of $98,279 opens the door to $103,574 and $108,753, where a larger correction may fully reverse. A breakout above $108,753 would flip the broader trend, setting up a run toward $115,000 in early 2026. Bitcoin Outlook and Trade Setup The cleanest setup appears on a confirmed daily close above the 20-EMA, supported by a higher low near $88,000–$89,500. With invalidation below $86,000, upside targets extend toward $103,000 and $108,000. Should sentiment improve, Bitcoin’s recovery could spill over into early-stage opportunities, including presale tokens positioned for the next market expansion, setting the stage for a stronger cycle ahead. Maxi Doge: The Meme Coin Built for Maximum Hype Maxi Doge is exploding in popularity as traders rush toward its high-energy meme identity and fast-growing presale. With over $4.20 million raised, it’s quickly becoming one of the standout meme tokens of the year. The project mixes bold branding with real engagement features, from ROI contests to nonstop community events, giving it more personality and momentum than typical dog coins. Its shredded, leverage-obsessed mascot has already turned Maxi Doge into a recognizable culture coin. Holders can also stake $MAXI for daily smart-contract rewards and unlock access to exclusive competitions and partner events. The staking utility adds a passive-earning layer that keeps users active and invested in the ecosystem. With $MAXI priced at $0.00027 and the next increase approaching, the presale continues to gain speed. If you’re looking for a meme coin built on hype, personality, and real community energy, Maxi Doge is shaping up to be one worth watching.

55146534,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=869972,1764502200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/55146534.jpeg,Will Cardano (ADA) Price Rebound as Hoskinson Hints at a TVL Surge Or Will This New Crypto Take The Spotlight?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/will-cardano-ada-price-rebound-as-hoskinson-hints-at-a-tvl-surge-or-will-this-new-crypto-take-the-spotlight/,"The cryptocurrency market is in dire need of some strong momentum, and the likes of established coins like Cardano (ADA) are under the closest observation. The ADA price has plummeted considerably and is currently slumping near the multi-month levels. Charles Hoskinson, the mastermind behind Cardano, has prophesied the Total Value Locked on the platform to witness an increase in the coming days, focusing on the impending launch on the Midnight platform and the rumored RealFi project. While this has led to some interesting chatter in the ADA ranks, the Total Value Locked on the platform has plummeted considerably in the present scenario, despite the overall downturn in the market. Simultaneously, the emergence of a strong up-and-coming rival in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is setting the benchmark on what pre-launch performance should ideally include. Cardano’s Road to Recovery Recently, the Cardano price has placed the asset among the worst-performing in the industry. Adoption levels on the network have come under fire, and the TVL figures highlight the issue. The bullish outlook offered by Hoskinson aims to dispel this, positing that the impending launch of the Midnight data protection platform and the large RealFi initiative could bring much-needed use and investment into the space. In terms of technicals, the ADA price now appears oversold, and the charts could see an uplift here. The network, however, has some work to do in translating promised partnerships into on-chain action. Unfortunately, this has led a number of would-be investors into the limelight elsewhere, making the search for the best cryptocurrency to invest in now zero in on those in the final development phases prior to launch in the world of decentralized finance. Mutuum Finance Presale Approaches Critical Point While Cardano has plans for a future comeback, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is precisely following through on its launch strategy. The organized presale offered by the project has become a thing of note, having raised $19,020,000 and accumulated 18,250 holders. The presale has now hit Phase 6, and the cost of the MUTM token now stands at $0.035. This represents a whopping 250% increase from the cost in Phase 1, making early supporters rich. An important detail for individuals interested in purchasing the token is the fact that Phase 6 has only allocated 95%, and things are selling out fast. This is the last chance fans get to own the much-awaited Mutuum Finance token at the $0.035 cost, since in Phase 7, the cost increases by almost 20%, launching at $0.040. At the officially announced cost at $0.06, those who decide on top crypto to buy now are in line for rather large gains when the asset goes live, potentially culminating in over 400% gains. The site encourages continued engagement through an innovative 24-hour leaderboard system. The leaderboard ranks the top 50 holders, and the number-one holder on each and every day gets a $500 MUTM reward, provided they make at least one trade in the 24-hour period. The leaderboard resets each day at 00:00 UTC. Moreover, the team has worked on easing access, and now the investor can use their card directly to invest in the platform by purchasing the MUTM tokens. Mutuum Finance encourages those researching the cryptocurrency platform that would be the best investment option through their clear and straightforward investment process. The development pace has also continued to strengthen its position, with an independent review of its loans and borrow contracts launched by Halborn Security. The project has also announced the confirmation of its V1 protocol on the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025, marking an essential transition from an idea to a working product. A Clear Choice for Forward-Thinking Investors The contrast between the speculative rally and the measurable progress could not be clearer. Mutuum Finance, abbreviated as MUTM, has an engaging scenario that positions it favorably in the lineup of the next big crypto platforms. The fact that the presale process has almost concluded in phase 6, accompanied by the high levels of development and the developing base, provides an attractive deal. The time slot available at the present price has almost run out, making it an imperative step in realizing the greatest returns. Furthermore, the choice available among the different cryptocurrencies available in the market has become clearer.

55146171,https://coinpaper.com/12760/top-ripple-executive-xrp-must-learn-from-solana-before-it-s-too-late,1764502479,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png,Top Ripple Executive: XRP Must Learn from Solana Before It's Too Late,https://coinpaper.com/12760/top-ripple-executive-xrp-must-learn-from-solana-before-it-s-too-late,"Luke Judges, Ripple's Global Partner Success Lead and Director, recently addressed misconceptions about his past involvement with Solana. The executive clarified that joining Ripple does not mean abandoning respect for other blockchain ecosystems. Judges revealed his extensive history with Solana before his current role. He founded two startups within the Solana ecosystem. He also operated a validator node that managed over $30 million in staked assets. His experience spans the full market cycle, witnessing Solana's price collapse from $200 to $8 before its subsequent recovery. Solana's Strengths and Weaknesses Judges acknowledged that Solana faces ongoing challenges. The network currently experiences a declining validator count. This presents concerns about decentralization and network security. Despite these issues, Judges maintains that Solana offers valuable lessons. He specifically highlighted the network's pragmatic approach and execution speed. These qualities have enabled Solana to rapidly gain market share. The executive suggested that XRP and other Layer 1 blockchains should study Solana's strategies. Learning from competitors strengthens the entire blockchain industry. Judges also noted Ethereum's response to competitive pressure. The Ethereum Foundation has sharpened its market strategy after losing ground to Solana. This demonstrates how competition drives innovation across blockchain platforms. The Ripple lead stressed that XRP does not operate in isolation. The blockchain can adopt successful strategies from other networks while maintaining its unique advantages. XRP's Smart Contract Evolution The timing of Judges' comments aligns with significant developments in the XRP ecosystem. XRP is actively exploring smart contract functionality and native staking capabilities. These initiatives reflect changing market demands. The recent approval of XRP exchange-traded funds in the United States has intensified focus on the blockchain's technical capabilities. David Schwartz, Ripple's Chief Technology Officer and original XRP Ledger architect, confirmed evolving perspectives on network governance. His thinking about consensus models has shifted over time. Schwartz revealed ongoing considerations about XRP's role in decentralized finance. He examines both organic DeFi applications through platforms like Flare, MoreMarkets, Axelar, and Doppler, as well as native on-chain possibilities. The CTO indicated that current market conditions favor discussions about enhanced DeFi features. Programmability initiatives are already underway within the XRP development community. Schwartz suggested the timing is appropriate to explore additional native DeFi capabilities for XRP Ledger. These conversations could reshape the blockchain's technical roadmap. Recent milestones support this direction. XRP Ledger Smart Contracts launched on AlphaNet, a dedicated development network. This marks a significant step toward programmable functionality. The AlphaNet deployment allows developers to test smart contract features before mainnet implementation. This phased approach reduces risk while building developer confidence. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at around $2.19, suggesting a 0.25% increase in the last 24 hours.

Scott Bessent, who’s now running the Treasury Department, is the one handling interviews with the candidates. He confirmed Trump will be meeting all five of them soon. The shortlist includes current Fed governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, former governor Kevin Warsh, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, and Rick Rieder, who runs fixed income for BlackRock. Trump keeps dropping hints about Bessent, even though Bessent himself said twice last week that he doesn’t want the job. Hassett says Fed failed on inflation and wants deeper rate cuts Kevin Hassett is considered the top contender , according to Bloomberg. He already worked for Trump in the first administration and currently serves as director of the National Economic Council. Hassett told Yahoo Finance that he’s big on keeping the Fed independent, fixing the way interest rates are set, and cutting rates to match the economy. He slammed the Fed for calling inflation during the pandemic “transitory,” saying they made serious mistakes by acting too late. He also pointed out that the Fed hiked rates just after Trump’s tax cuts were passed, then decided to slash them again before the 2024 election.“I think they’ve made some bad policy decisions, and they’ve made policy decisions that look to me to be at times partisan,” Hassett said.“There’s a lot of house-cleaning needs to happen at the Federal Reserve.” Hassett agrees with Trump that rates could go “a lot lower” and warned against pausing rate cuts in December, citing the unknown impact of the government shutdown. He supports a full 50 basis point cut next month and said he would accept the job if offered. Jaret Seiberg from TD Cowen thinks Kevin Warsh might still have an edge, but agrees that Hassett remains a top option due to his frequent contact with the president. Christopher Waller, Seiberg said, could be a fallback pick if there’s a deadlock. “We would not describe any of the three leading contenders as traditional doves,” he said, noting that while they’ve all pushed for cuts, none are soft on inflation. “All three would risk a confrontation with Trump if inflation became a top concern.” Waller, Bowman, Warsh, Rieder bring experience; and rate cuts Christopher Waller, already a Fed board member, lines up closely with Trump on policy. He was the first one inside the central bank to call for a rate cut back in July. He now wants to cut again in December, saying the bigger threat is a slowing job market. He blames the drop in payroll growth mostly on lower demand, not just immigration. Waller said he doesn’t see signs of rising wages or quits, and thinks inflation, excluding tariffs, is almost back to 2%. He called tariffs a one-off price bump. He was nominated by Trump and worked as research director at the St. Louis Fed for over a decade. Waller told Fox Business that he spoke with Bessent about the job, saying, “I think they are looking for someone who has merit, experience, and knows what they are doing in the job, and I think I fit that.” Michelle Bowman, also appointed by Trump, now serves as vice chair of supervision. She supports rate cuts because she thinks the labor market is looking more fragile. She’s already penciled in three cuts for the year and is backing another one soon. Bowman’s been busy rewriting the bank playbook; she opposed Michael Barr’s Basel III plan, which would’ve raised capital requirements by 20%. She said that would “significantly harm the economy” and plans to drop a new version next year. She also reorganized the Fed’s supervision unit, cutting staff by around 30%, and changed how the biggest banks get rated. She’s leading a proposal to publish stress-test models used by the Fed, which banks like. Kevin Warsh once looked like the frontrunner earlier this year. He served on the Fed board from 2006 to 2011 and became Ben Bernanke’s main link to Wall Street during the 2008 crash. Trump had already interviewed him for this job once, eight years ago. Warsh recently attacked Jerome Powell for “unwise choices,” arguing that post-pandemic inflation came from overspending and money printing, not wage growth. Rick Rieder manages $2.4 trillion at BlackRock and sits on the Fed’s Investment Advisory Committee. He thinks a December cut is overdue. In a recent chat with Yahoo Finance, Rieder said inflation is still hot, but labor problems are becoming more urgent. If you take out health care jobs, he said job growth was actually negative through spring and summer. “I think that is something that is going to be persistent,” Rieder said. “Hopefully, the economy continues to be resilient, which I think it will … the economy’s in good shape, companies are in great shape, labor not so much.” Sharpen your strategy with mentorship + daily ideas - 30 days free access to our trading program",Economy|Federal Reserve|USD,EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-30 11:55:29

According to SoSoValue , Grayscale’s ETHE has now recorded a staggering –$4.93 billion in cumulative net redemptions, the largest outflow among all Ethereum-listed ETFs. While the broader ETH ETF market saw $76.5 million in daily net inflows, these gains were overshadowed by Grayscale’s selling pressure. US ETH Spot ETF – Source: Sosovalue ETHE’s 2.5% fee, far higher than competitors like BlackRock’s ETHA at 0.25%, continues to push legacy holders to exit positions. That process mirrors the heavy GBTC unwind that weighed on Bitcoin earlier this year. While BlackRock’s ETHA posted $68.27 million in daily inflows, the tug-of-war between ETHE’s redemptions and inflows elsewhere has left overall confidence fragile. Combined net ETF assets now stand near $19.15 billion, representing roughly 5.2% of Ethereum’s market capitalization. For traders, the message is clear: the structural demand is improving, but ETHE’s outflows remain the dominant headwind in the near term. Macro Sentiment Adds to Volatility Uncertainty across broader risk markets compounds the pressure. A cautious tone from the Federal Reserve, slowing liquidity conditions, and ongoing liquidation in leveraged crypto positions have encouraged investors to tread carefully. While institutional appetite for ETH exposure remains intact, particularly through BlackRock, Fidelity, and Bitwise, the rotation away from ETHE has created an uneven demand profile that ETH must work through before a sustained rally can emerge. In short, the ETF landscape is improving, but the recovery is uneven, and it shows on the charts. Ethereum (ETH/USD) Technical Outlook: Downtrend Still Dominant Ethereum price prediction is attempting to stabilize after a steep November decline, but its daily structure still leans bearish within a well-defined descending channel stretching from the $3,666 breakdown. ETH trades near $3,002, sitting just under the 20-day EMA at $3,087, which has capped every rebound for nearly a month. A daily close above this level would mark the first meaningful shift in momentum. The rebound from $2,632 is encouraging but not yet a trend reversal. Candles show hesitation, small bodies, mild upper wicks, and no strong engulfing signals. Meanwhile, the RSI has lifted from oversold 30 to around 40, showing easing bearish pressure but offering no bullish divergence yet. Ethereum Price Chart – Source: Tradingview TradingView’s projected path points toward a retest of $3,080–$3,120, followed by a potential rejection that could pull ETH back toward $2,632. A deeper decline exposes $2,192, the lower boundary of the channel and a key historical demand area. To flip bullish, ETH must break above the 20-EMA and then the channel ceiling near $3,300. A breakout there unlocks a move toward $3,666 and potentially $4,242. Outlook: A Breakout Could Trigger New Opportunities For now, patience is key. Traders will look for a higher low around $2,700 or a confirmed daily close above $3,120 to validate a recovery. If momentum flips decisively, Ethereum could be among the first majors to ignite a broader market rebound, a shift that historically channels fresh capital toward early-stage presale projects ready to benefit from the next expansion cycle. Maxi Doge: The Meme Coin Built for Maximum Hype Maxi Doge is exploding in popularity as traders rush toward its high-energy meme identity and fast-growing presale. With over $4.20 million raised, it’s quickly becoming one of the standout meme tokens of the year.

That is a modest rise, but it matters because Bitcoin miners are already working with very thin margins. Hashpower is strong enough to push difficulty up even while returns stay near record lows. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s November Slump Could Trigger A 2026 Revival, Analysts Say Hashprice Sits Near Break-Even Hashrate Index data shows hashprice is hovering around $38.3 PH/s per day, a touch up from a recent trough below $35 PH/s on November 21. Reports indicate that $40 PH/s is roughly the break-even level for many operations. When revenue per petahash drifts under that mark, some miners face a hard choice as they usher in December: switch off rigs or keep paying to mine. Average block times have been close to the 10-minute goal, with the network recently averaging about 9.97 minutes, which helped trigger the most recent adjustment that dropped difficulty from 152.2 trillion to 149.3 trillion. Hardware, Politics And Supply Risks Reports have disclosed a US Department of Homeland Security probe into Bitmain, the China-based ASIC maker, over concerns its machines could be accessed remotely. Bitmain is reported to control about 80% of the ASIC market, according to the University of Cambridge. That market concentration leaves the industry vulnerable. If US officials impose restrictions, tariffs, or other limits, miners could face higher hardware costs and slower deliveries. Some equipment orders might be delayed or rerouted, and expansion plans would be tested. China Unlikely To End Bitcoin Mining Ban Despite Uptick Meanwhile, overseas, a mild uptick in China’s bitcoin mining has led some scholars to urge Beijing to relax its ban so miners can use excess energy, but experts say a formal reversal is unlikely. Related Reading: 320 Ether On The Move: Bhutan Ramps Up Its Staking Game According to Hashrate Index, China’s share of global hash rate rose from 13.75% in Q1 2025 to 14% in the current quarter, placing it third behind the US and Russia. Historical data from the Cambridge index shows China’s hash rate fell to zero in July 2021 before unofficial activity pushed it back to 22.29% by September 2021; Cambridge stopped updating its mining map in February 2022. Beijing has tightened rules on crypto in recent years, arguing such activity disrupts financial order and can enable illegal behavior. Experts believe those political and policy concerns make an official lift of the mining ban unlikely, despite the recent rise in activity.

In a statement on social media, Buterin stated that token voting is “flawed in many ways” and could lead to long-term erosion, especially for projects that prioritize privacy. Related News: BlackRock Makes Statement on Bitcoin: “Outflows Are Natural” Buterin issued a clear warning, saying, “I hope Zcash can resist the dark hand of token voting.” The Ethereum founder, stating that token voting is worse than the current Zcash governance model, also referenced his previous critique of the governance. He argued that the “median token holder” shaping decisions in token voting could lead to the devaluation of sensitive issues like privacy over time. While the Zcash ecosystem has been in the news in recent months with discussions about changes to its governance model, Buterin's position is particularly significant. He has previously stated that privacy-focused projects could move away from decentralization through token voting, and that this model would result in large wallets gaining ground. *This is not investment advice.

Even so, several structural developments within the crypto ecosystem continue to shape long-term expectations for the asset. Analysts and data models have increasingly evaluated how these changes could influence XRP’s valuation by 2031, resulting in a wide range of projections. Key Drivers Supporting Long-Term Optimism Several market developments have contributed to renewed interest in XRP’s long-term outlook. The introduction of the first XRP spot ETF, issued by Canary Capital under the ticker XRPC, represents one of the most significant recent milestones. Additional ETF products are expected to follow, potentially expanding institutional exposure to the asset. At the corporate level, companies such as Evernorth , VivoPower, and Trident Digital have announced positions in XRP for treasury management purposes. These actions suggest growing interest in utilizing XRP within formal financial structures. Regulatory conditions have also become more transparent in the United States and other jurisdictions, reducing uncertainty for institutional participants. Meanwhile, Ripple continues to expand its operational footprint through new partnerships , pilot programs, and acquisitions. These factors form the backdrop for several long-range estimations offered by both automated models and human analysts. Gemini’s Long-Term Scenarios for XRP To examine how XRP might perform by 2031 under varying market assumptions, the AI model Google Gemini assessed the influence of expanding institutional demand, regulatory clarity, and increased adoption of blockchain-based payment solutions. In one scenario, Gemini projected that XRP could reach the $50 to $75 range by the end of the decade if global ETF participation introduces significant capital inflows and if XRP secures a stronger position within the group of widely recognized digital assets. This possibility relies on steady progress in the asset’s use as a cross-border settlement tool. A second scenario focused on broader integration into international payments and corporate treasury operations. Under this outlook, XRP would capture a measurable portion of global remittances, foreign-exchange processing, and early central bank digital currency (CBDC) interoperability. Gemini estimated that such conditions could support valuations between $100 and $200 by 2031. The most ambitious scenario involved XRP becoming a widely adopted settlement instrument in institutional finance, accompanied by robust regulatory approval and increased participation from financial institutions. Gemini noted that this environment could push XRP above $500 and potentially near or above $1,000 , though it also stressed that substantial risks remain. Any unexpected regulatory, competitive, or market challenges could significantly undermine these projections. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Additional Forecasts from Market Analysts Outside of automated modeling, several analysts have offered independent projections. Forecasts from Changelly indicate that XRP could begin 2031 around $22, rise to approximately $31.46 midway through the year, and potentially close near $37.33. This estimate represents a comparatively measured outlook. Another perspective comes from market commentator 24HrsCrypto, who suggested in March 2025 that XRP could trade between roughly $92.59 and $185.19 by 2030, emphasizing the potential benefits of long-term holding strategies. Adding yet another angle, EasyA founders Phil and Dom Kwok suggested earlier in the year that XRP could reach $1,000 by 2030, stressing that the asset has not tapped the substantial growth within the decentralized finance sector. While opinions vary widely, the forecasts highlight one consistent theme: XRP’s long-term trajectory depends heavily on adoption, regulatory clarity, and its ability to deepen its role in emerging financial systems.

According to recent analysis, researchers have revealed that the country has accumulated research on artificial intelligence since the late 90s, focusing on pattern recognition, speech processing, and data optimization. According to reports, if North Korea were to leverage AI-based automation technologies, its cybercriminal activities, including crypto theft, money laundering, and fake identity creation, could be on the rise. While it has not utilized those high-end models, the reports claim that North Korean researchers have been partially using Nvidia graphics cards, including the GeForce RTX 2700, which has been subject to export restrictions. North Korea accused of using banned Nvidia GPUs to steal crypto According to Kim Min Jung, head of the Advanced Technology Strategy Center at the Institute for National Security Strategy (INSS), a National Intelligence Service think tank, there is a need to precisely monitor the country’s AI research trend and policy responses to suppress the military and cyber diversion of related technologies. He shared those thoughts in a report titled Analysis of North Korea’s AI Status and Policy Considerations. The report mentioned that North Korea has spent nearly 30 years building AI research capabilities that are centered on pattern recognition, data optimization, and speech processing. It mentioned that since the 2010s, North Korea has greatly improved its internal capacities through the expansion of research institutions and the development of its algorithms. The studies carried out this year focused on facial recognition and other aspects, including accent identification and multi-object tracking. These efforts were undertaken to improve accuracy and processing speed despite limited computational and data environments. These technologies could identify targets, predict movements, and improve efficiency in disrupting command communications or carrying out social engineering attacks. Some of the studies used the GeForce RTX 2700, which the United States Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has designated as a prohibited item to be exported into North Korea. Illicit funds continue to power weapons program The report claimed that such AI capabilities, including the production of deepfake material , evasion of detection, and improved crypto theft, are possible. In the past few years, North Korea has pushed resources into its nuclear and missile weapons programs amid international sanctions. Regarding digital asset theft, the report noted: “Utilizing high-performance AI computational resources could exponentially increase attack and theft attempts per unit time, enabling a small number of personnel to conduct operations with efficiency and precision comparable to industrial-scale efforts.” In the report, the cooperation between North Korea, China, and Russia was mentioned, noting that it has improved since the Ukraine war. The report cited it as a main variable that could accelerate the practical deployment of AI technologies. It emphasized the need to monitor and analyze North Korea’s AI application in several aspects. In addition, it added that while North Korea may be looking to expand its data center, there are no signs of using top-tier generative AI. Meanwhile, a previous report by AhnLab has fingered hacking group Lazarus as the suspect in over 31 cyberattacks in the past year. The report was widely circulated amid speculations that the group might be behind the recent breach at South Korean crypto exchange Upbit. The report claimed that aside from Lazarus, another North Korea-based group, Kimsuky, was second with 27 cases. However, in terms of countries, North Korea accounted for 86 incidents, while Russia followed at 27.

XRP slipped 1% on the day but continues to hold its position as the world’s fourth-largest cryptocurrency, backed by a market cap of nearly $132 billion. With 60.3 billion tokens circulating, investors are now debating whether XRP has the momentum to climb toward the much-discussed $5.50 target by late 2026. Market Structure Shows Signs of Stabilization XRP’s recent price behavior reflects a market trying to stabilize after months of pressure. The daily chart shows XRP repeatedly defending the $2.1458 zone, a level where long wick candles indicate steady buyer commitment. For a market that’s been trapped under a descending trendline since early October, this defense matters. It signals that sellers are losing their grip. The 20-day EMA flattening near $2.2026 adds another layer of support. It’s the first time in weeks that this trend filter isn’t pointing sharply downward, hinting that XRP may be preparing for a structural shift. Momentum remains soft, but the groundwork for a reversal is slowly forming. XRP/USD Triangle Compression Sets Up a December Breakout XRP price prediction is neutral as XRP is now coiling inside a tightening triangle pattern, a structure that typically precedes a notable breakout. Several Doji-style candles over the last week show hesitation, not weakness. Traders are waiting for a catalyst. XRP/USD Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The RSI sits near 47, a neutral position that leaves room for expansion in either direction. If XRP manages a clean daily close above the descending trendline, the first major test arrives at $2.3847. Clearing this level could unlock a move toward $2.5783, followed by a more ambitious push toward $2.78. Technical analysis points to a minor pullback toward $2.20–$2.23 first, allowing XRP to form a healthier higher low before charging at resistance. What It Means for Traders Heading Into 2026 The most attractive setup forms once XRP breaks, retests, and holds above the trendline. That structure provides a clearer runway toward higher levels, and opens the door to more aggressive targets in early 2026. If momentum strengthens alongside renewed liquidity across the crypto market, a march toward $5.50 becomes less far-fetched. With presale activity heating up and capital rotating back into high-beta assets, XRP’s next breakout may not only lift existing holders, it could also pull new investors into the broader market cycle. Maxi Doge: The Meme Coin Built for Maximum Hype Maxi Doge is exploding in popularity as traders rush toward its high-energy meme identity and fast-growing presale. With over $4.20 million raised, it’s quickly becoming one of the standout meme tokens of the year.

Over the weekend, Nvidia sent a seven-page memo to analysts denying that it uses vendor financing, a method where suppliers loan money to their own buyers. The Substack post that triggered the memo compared Nvidia to Enron and Lucent. Enron broke after hiding debt off its balance sheet during the internet boom. Lucent broke after loaning money to customers that later failed. The writer said Nvidia now fits that same pattern through what was described as circular financing . Jim Chanos, the investor known for calling the collapse of Enron, said the comparison between Nvidia and Lucent makes sense. When the dot-com crash hit and the payments stopped, Lucent wrote off billions. Chanos calls out Nvidia’s customer cash loop In an interview with Yahoo Finance, Jim said Nvidia is sending money into firms that are losing cash just so those firms can keep ordering its chips.“They’re putting money into money-losing companies in order for those companies to order their chips,” Jim said. Nvidia has made direct investments into OpenAI, xAI, CoreWeave, and Nebius, all of which depend heavily on Nvidia’s hardware and are still burning cash. Nvidia denied any link to accounting abuse. In its memo, the company said it does not look like historical fraud cases and said its business is sound and its books are clean. It also said its customers pay within 53 days of buying chips, not over several years like traditional vendor loan deals. The company said it does not use vendor financing to grow revenue and said its sales system is simple. That denial did not change the tone of the short sellers. Michael Burry , the investor who predicted the 2008 housing crash, went further in a post on X last week. Michael said Nvidia is one of several AI companies showing “suspicious revenue recognition” because of how deeply it invests in its own buyers. His warning landed just days after Nvidia’s memo hit inboxes. Debt loads and data center rush raise fresh risks Jim also warned that debt inside the AI sector is turning into another stress point. He said some of Nvidia’s biggest buyers now use off-balance-sheet debt to pay for chips. He named Meta and xAI as firms using those structures. Others like Anthropic are using standard loans. Jim said the mix of heavy borrowing and money-losing business models creates a weak base under the entire market. “Putting lots of credit and really arcane financial structures on top of these money-losing entities is the real Achilles heel to the AI tech market,” Jim said during the same interview. Both Jim and Michael Burry said the bigger danger may not be billing methods at all. They said the real risk is scale. The largest tech firms on Earth are spending billions on AI data centers before users show up. In his Substack called Cassandra Unchained , Michael wrote that the market now has “catastrophically overbuilt supply and nowhere near enough demand.” He said the world is filling with too many chips, too many servers, and too many empty buildings waiting for real users. Nvidia told investors the opposite in its latest earnings report. The company said demand for its chips is “off the charts” and said it is still a full generation ahead of rivals. It also responded to growing pressure from Google, whose rising chip efforts pushed Nvidia’s stock lower before a rebound on Wednesday. Jim said the speed of the build-out itself is the core danger. If demand falls short of what buyers expect in 2027 or 2028, he said orders could start disappearing. “If it turns out that we don’t quite need all the data center or chip capacity we thought we will in ’27 or ’28, you could see orders begin to be canceled,” Jim said. “That’s a big risk that not a lot of people are talking about.” Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

According to the Cyber Crime Police of Hyderabad, two men from Vash, Navi Mumbai, were arrested for their alleged roles in an investment fraud, targeting a Hyderabad resident who lost Rs. 12.3 lakh to the fraudulent scheme. According to an official from the unit, the arrest followed a complaint from the 53-year-old victim, who was deceived by the scammers who posed as investment advisers. The Hyderabad officer mentioned that the suspects were running their illegal operations under Flames Alliance and Munoth Capital Investment Limited. The accused were identified as Ravi Kumar Lal and Shivendra Ashok Singh. Hyderabad police apprehend suspects in fake investment scheme Investigators attached to the Hyderabad police mentioned that they started looking into the facts of the case after the complainant submitted his petition. They claimed that Ravi Kumar Lal operated a bank account by passing on OTPs through an APK file to an associate who resides in Pune. The police claimed that the associate, after getting wind of their arrests, left his residence and is still on the run, making retrieval challenging. On the other hand, Shivendra Ashok Singh was in charge of supplying mule bank accounts that were used to move funds stolen from victims. The officers claimed that the suspects approached the victim on WhatsApp, sending unsolicited messages before he agreed to listen to what they had to say. The suspects, posing as stock market experts, promised him exceptional returns if he would invest in a platform that they would introduce to him. With the profit enticing, he agreed to invest. Between August 13 and 28, the suspect transferred money into several accounts after being shown fabricated profits and reassured through small withdrawals when he started investing. However, problems started when he deposited larger funds. He claimed that the suspects first blocked his access to the platform before vanishing. Investigators with the Hyderabad police claimed that the suspects used a modus operandi that they had come across multiple times. Police urge residents to be watchful According to the investor, while one of the accused handled the bank accounts, the other one was in charge of the operation and the mobile numbers linked to the bank accounts. The officers claimed the victim was shown manipulated profits to create a sense of urgency. They knew that once he saw he had started making huge profits, he was going to go all in on his investments, which he did without fail. The officers noted that aside from this scam, the pair had also been linked to other kinds of fraud across India . In a similar case, the police arrested a suspect for stealing Rs. 26 lakh through a fake stock market investment. Police claimed that the suspect promoted it on social media, targeting unsuspecting elderly people to pitch mouth-watering profits. The criminal misled the victim, showing him a manipulated platform and taking money from him at intervals. However, when he tried to withdraw his funds, he discovered that it was a fake platform. Meanwhile, the Hyderabad police added that about four mobile phones and three cheque books were seized from the accused. Police claimed that this kind of scam has been rampant across the country since the start of the year, noting that the lax regulations concerning the crypto industry and digital assets have given the scammers enough room to operate. They have urged residents to be alert before they enter into any investment. In addition, people who want to make investments should seek advice from the right experts. Get seen where it counts.

The OG crypto token is down 28% from its October all-time high of $126,000, now sitting around $91,000. This is now its worst monthly drop since June 2022. The sell-off hasn’t let up, and everything from ETF exits to miner losses is piling on. There’s no single reason why it’s falling. It’s a mix of institutional selling, cash draining out, and old holders calling it quits. And now, as traders get ready for the December 9 FOMC meeting, there’s little reason to expect a turnaround. Here’s where it all starts falling apart. ETFs dump Bitcoin, stablecoin capital dries up Over $3.5 billion has been pulled from Bitcoin ETFs just in November, the biggest monthly outflow since February, according to 10X Research. “That indicates that institutional investors have stopped allocating into bitcoin,” said Markus Thielen, founder of the firm. “These ETFs have turned into sellers, and as long as they keep selling, I think the markets will struggle to stay up, or rebound.” On top of that, fewer stablecoins are being minted. That’s usually a sign that new capital isn’t entering the market. Last week alone, around $800 million left crypto entirely and moved back into fiat, based on 10X’s data. Meanwhile, stablecoin market cap dropped $4.6 billion through November 1, according to DeFiLlama. “Money is not just failing to come in, it’s actually leaving the crypto market,” said Thielen. “That’s why bitcoin dominance is failing to pick up.” Earlier this week, Bitcoin briefly bounced after the Federal Reserve hinted at a possible rate cut in December. But Thielen doesn’t buy the rally. He expects that to fade before or during the December 9 Fed meeting, calling it just a “short-term, oversold reaction.” He says even if the Fed cuts rates, it’ll be a hawkish cut, not the kind of policy shift that kicks off a major bull run. Back on October 10, Bitcoin got hit hard during a leveraged liquidation event . That single day wiped out $19 billion in market value. The damage from that day is still being felt, with no clear sign of recovery since. Long-term holders cash out, miners and altcoins collapse Old-school Bitcoin holders are also selling. Some are reacting to the cycle. Others just want to spend their money. “There has been OG people selling every single cycle,” said Nicolai Søndergaard, research analyst at Nansen. “I think they just reach that point where they decide, okay, maybe I’ve gotten old enough, and I want to use this money now for something else.” This round of selling has smashed the rest of the digital asset market. Total crypto market cap is now at $2.99 trillion, down more than 30% from $4.28 trillion on October 6. It’s not just Bitcoin. Ethereum has dropped 38% since early October. Solana? Down over 40%. Søndergaard says if there’s any hope of a rebound , it’s going to come from either ETF demand returning or more companies stepping in to buy. But that’s not happening yet. Look at Strategy (MSTR), they didn’t announce a token purchase on Monday, even though they’d been doing that for six weeks in a row before now. Their model of loading Bitcoin onto balance sheets had sparked imitators. Now that wave’s dried up. Strategy’s still in profit. But other digital asset treasuries (DATs)? Most are now underwater on their positions. No one’s buying. Everyone’s waiting. Mind you, miners have tanked too. Names like IREN, Riot, and Mara Holdings have all dropped over 30%. Doesn’t matter that they’ve been shifting toward AI services, the market’s not giving them a break either.

He said the company’s Bitcoin funds now sit at the top of its revenue list. Keep in mind that BlackRock runs more than 1,400 ETFs worldwide and controls over $13.4 trillion in total assets. Cristiano spoke at the Blockchain Conference in São Paulo and called the growth “a big surprise.”He said money flowing into BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETFs, including the U.S. fund IBIT and Brazil’s IBIT39, is now close to $100 billion. He said, “When we launched, we were optimistic, but we didn’t expect this scale.” The comment came as Bitcoin funds faced both inflows and outflows across global markets. IBIT breaks records and pulls in billions IBIT launched in January 2024 after U.S. regulators approved spot Bitcoin ETFs. The fund became the fastest ETF in history to reach $70 billion in assets. It did that in 341 days. Even with Bitcoin price swings, the fund now holds $70.7 billion in net assets, based on SoSoValue data. During its first year, IBIT recorded more than $52 billion in net inflows. That number beat every other ETF launched in the past ten years. By October 2025, IBIT had already produced about $245 million in yearly fees. The growth came from BlackRock’s global sales network and from rising demand by large institutions after U.S. approval. IBIT now controls more than 3% of Bitcoin’s total supply. After that success, BlackRock rolled out other Bitcoin-linked products, including overseas ETPs. Cristiano also spoke on recent money leaving some Bitcoin funds. He said outflows match how retail investors often react when prices drop. “ETFs are a very liquid and powerful tool. They’re meant for people to manage flows,” he said . BlackRock also increased its own exposure . Its Strategic Income Opportunities Portfolio recently lifted its IBIT stake by 14%, showing the firm is still increasing its Bitcoin-linked exposure from inside. Former BlackRock staff launch HelloTrade Two former BlackRock digital asset staff, Kevin Tang and Wyatt Raich, later left to build their own company. Both worked inside BlackRock as it shifted from crypto skeptics to ETF issuers. Kevin served as a senior director on the digital assets team. Wyatt ran engineering at the digital asset lab. During their time there, they helped with the launch of IBIT and the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA). Both funds posted record openings on the stock market and ranked among the first crypto ETFs ever released. Kevin and Wyatt later said it was too hard for people outside the U.S. to invest in basic assets like American stocks. That led them to start HelloTrade, a mobile-first trading platform built on blockchain tech. The company announced on Thursday that it raised $4.6 million in seed funding. The round was led by Dragonfly Capital, with backing from Mirana Ventures and angel investors. Kevin, now the CEO, said in an interview with Fortune, “We see a huge market opportunity to make these traditional assets such as stocks and commodities accessible to anyone around the world with an internet connection.” He added, “We believe that the next frontier of blockchain adoption will be the movement of these traditional markets on chain.” HelloTrade plans to let users outside the U.S. buy American assets. For example, people in Vietnam or Indonesia who want to buy Tesla stock often cannot do so through local brokers. The company wants to fix that using crypto tools. The platform will also offer perpetual futures, which give users more exposure than standard cash trades. Kevin said platforms like Robinhood and Revolut offer similar access but feel clunky to many users. He said HelloTrade will focus on a cleaner user experience. The product is not live yet. Kevin expects the launch by the end of this year or the beginning of next year. The company currently employs about 10 staff members. Get seen where it counts.

Here’s Why This Is Big News,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-supply-drops-massively-on-exchanges-heres-why-this-is-big-news/,"Crypto analyst and investor Xaif Crypto reported that XRP holdings on centralized exchanges have seen a pronounced decline, based on on-chain data from Glassnode. The data shows that exchange balances fell from approximately 3.95 billion XRP on 21 September to about 2.6 billion XRP on 27 November, a decline of more than 45% over the stated 60-day window. These figures align with recent reports showing significant withdrawals and notable outflows from major exchange custodial addresses . XRP Supply on Exchanges Drops Over 45% in 60 Days Fresh data from Glassnode shows a major supply shift happening right now. From 3.95B XRP on Sept 21 to just 2.6B XRP on Nov 27, exchange balances have fallen by more than 45%. https://t.co/mICyZcZya9 pic.twitter.com/7GuriJFhNp — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) November 28, 2025 Immediate interpretation of the supply shift The reduction in exchange reserves shown in the Glassnode data implies a substantial shift of tokens away from the liquidity normally available for immediate trading. Market participants often view this contraction in accessible XRP as a reduction in near-term sell pressure. Independent reports have noted comparable withdrawals and described the scale of these movements as unusual for typical retail activity. Market context and potential implications Analysts cited by multiple outlets have linked the exchange outflows to accumulation by large holders and to increased institutional interest following the introduction of spot-based investment vehicles . The decline in on-exchange supply reduces the immediate counterparty liquidity available to execute large market sell orders and, therefore, can alter the microstructure of order books. While reduced exchange reserves do not guarantee a specific price outcome, the shift changes the supply side of the market and may increase sensitivity to new demand. Caveats and data considerations The Glassnode metric represents balances linked to exchange address clusters and carries the usual limitations of on-chain clustering and address classification. Exchange reserves can shift quickly as platforms move assets between hot and cold wallets or when institutional activity relies on off-chain settlement. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 For this reason, short-term increases or decreases in reported balances should be viewed with an understanding that operational transfers may contribute alongside genuine accumulation. Several outlets that have cited the Glassnode data and similar metrics acknowledge these methodological limitations, yet still emphasize that the scale of the recent outflows is significant. The post highlights a substantial decline in XRP held on exchanges as shown in the Glassnode data. The drop from 3.95 billion to 2.6 billion units over 60 days marks a meaningful change in available exchange liquidity. Analysts will keep observing upcoming balance reports and trading-volume indicators to determine whether this contraction persists and how it may align with future demand.

The bank said these stocks are set up for more gains into year-end, even with markets already running hot. Nvidia is still Bank of America’s top sector call. Analysts backed the stock again, pointing to strong demand for AI chips, solid control of supply, and upgraded earnings forecasts. “Reiterate Buy, top sector pick as AI demand continues to strengthen,” the bank wrote. They said valuation remains attractive with over 40% EPS growth potential, and called out how Nvidia shifted from PC graphics to powering everything from gaming and enterprise graphics to cloud, automotive, and AI infrastructure. Palantir gains speed, Robinhood grows reach Palantir was labeled a top AI software name again, with Bank of America saying it’s pulling away from competitors. Mariana Perez Mora said, “You have to see it for yourself,” citing growth and new deals. Total customer count rose 45% year over year, while U.S. commercial customers grew 65%. Shares are up 123% in 2025, and the bank raised its price target from $215 to $255 per share. The bank called Palantir the “best-in-class AI enabler, integrator, architect, and developer.” Mora added that Palantir’s “first mover advantages” and highly secure software give it an edge in both defense and enterprise markets. On the brokerage side, Robinhood is back in the spotlight. “Firing on all cylinders,” analyst Craig Siegenthaler said, after the company posted earnings that beat on both the top and bottom line. Despite calling the stock’s valuation “full,” he raised his price target to $166 from $157. Robinhood’s making gains outside its traditional user base.“While historically focusing on smaller accounts, mobile first, younger generation clients, HOOD has made headway expanding their TAM through further client penetration,” Siegenthaler wrote. He sees long-term performance ahead as the company scales, launches more products, and grows both U.S. and international reach. Shares have skyrocketed 245% year to date. Crane and Supernus offer stability and overlooked growth Crane, the industrial firm, hardly ever flashes big headlines, but Bank of America sees value in its consistency. “Even though the company describes their consistent performance as ‘boring’ we remain excited and bullish on Crane’s ability to remain boring and execute,” Ronald Epstein wrote. Crane is expanding in aerospace, defense, and process flow tech. It’s targeting higher margins in legacy business lines while using M&A to expand. Shares have jumped over 20% this year. Supernus Pharmaceuticals also got a Buy rating.

However, the company generated only $7 million in AI infrastructure revenue last quarter, making the scale-up to multi-billion-dollar revenue highly challenging with significant execution risks. Bitcoin mining still represents 95% of total revenue, exposing IREN to cryptocurrency volatility while the AI infrastructure business remains unproven at scale. With a $14 billion market cap against $689 million TTM revenue and deeply negative free cash flow, the optimistic growth scenario appears already priced in, resulting in a ""Hold"" rating. IREN Limited ( IREN ) is on fire with a 400% rally over the last year. Such big optimism is explained by the company's AI infrastructure exposure and expected massive revenue growth in this domain. The company's differentiation strategy is quite interesting, which includes utilizing spare data center capacity to mine Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) as well. However, I think that potential exponential AI infrastructure business growth might be challenging to achieve given no expertise in scaling up that fast. With just around $7 million in the latest quarterly AI infrastructure sales, I think that there are several execution risks on the horizon. Of course, if they manage to deliver on their obligations under these large contracts, the stock has the potential to soar further. However, I think that this optimism is already priced in due to the company's almost $14 billion market cap and the current TTM revenue far below a billion. All in all, I prefer to wait on the sidelines and assign a ""Hold"" rating to this stock. Fundamentals IREN Limited is an AI infrastructure company. IREN's important differentiator is that apart from generating revenue from its data centers' capacity, it also earns on mining the Bitcoin. The company currently operates six data centers across North America with a total capacity of 2,910 MW , and also has a large expansion pipeline focused on expanding its Texas capacity. Moreover, there are additional buildouts at other existing sites. Data by YCharts Since IREN operates in two rapidly growing industries like AI infrastructure and digital assets, it is no wonder that its revenue has been growing exponentially over the last few years. The company is profitable, and we can see from the above chart that its EBITDA has been growing approximately at the same pace as revenue until mid-2025. In mid-2025, revenue growth started accelerating, and EBITDA growth was lagging. I am not going to say that it is a red flag because heavy investments in growth are vital for accelerating topline expansion. However, the EBITDA dynamic compared to revenue is the one I would prefer to follow because if profitability [in absolute numbers] does not align with the revenue growth pace, there might be some flaws in the business model. Data by YCharts Despite being profitable from the income statement standpoint, IREN's free cash flow [FCF] is deeply negative because of the capital intensive nature of its business. Data centers aren't cheap, and IREN's net capital expenditure on the TTM basis is $1.2 billion , almost two times higher than the company's TTM revenue of around $690 million . Seeking Alpha The company's revenue soared during FQ1 2026 [ended September 30, 2025] by 349% on a YoY basis. The comparative figure of just $54 million was quite low, which partially explains such a massive percentage change. However, revenue growth was impressive on a QoQ basis as well, a 29% sequential growth. The company reported its earnings on November 6, and IREN has plunged by around 36% since then. One of the primary reasons that triggered the sell-off was a large non-GAAP EPS miss. Author's compilation Another warning sign, in my opinion, is the fact that IREN's aggressive sequential revenue growth is expected to pause in the next quarter. Wall Street analysts expect FQ2 2026 revenue to be $233 million, which will be lower by around 5% sequentially. Of course, it will be a huge YoY revenue increase compared to $120 million in FQ2 2025. Nevertheless, a sequential revenue decline after rapid QoQ growth over a few previous quarters is not something that investors usually like. Moreover, AI infrastructure does not look like a seasonal business. I think that the biggest problem at the moment is that AI infrastructure represents just a tiny portion of IREN's total revenue. In FQ1 2026, revenue from Bitcoin mining jumped to $233 million , which is around 95% of the total. There is still one month left in the current quarter, but based on the notably declined Bitcoin price in October-November, it is highly likely that the average BTC-USD price during FQ2 2026 will be notably lower than the average price in FQ1 2026. Therefore, it is no wonder that IREN's revenue is expected to dip sequentially in FQ2 2026. However, the estimated QoQ decline of 5% might be too optimistic given the fact that Bitcoin is currently around 16% cheaper than it was on October 1, 2025. Since Bitcoin mining represents 95% of IREN's sales, it is highly likely that a 16% BTC-USD price decline would affect consolidated revenues significantly. Seeking Alpha IREN's idea of differentiating its AI infrastructure approach by allocating part of its computing capacity for Bitcoin mining is very interesting in theory. Being flexible in reallocating computing power depending on external trends could have been a powerful differentiator if revenues were more or less evenly split between these two areas. However, IREN's AI infrastructure footprint is still too small, with just $7+ million in revenue in FQ1 2026. Furthermore, the potential crypto winter in the foreseeable future can potentially convert IREN's Bitcoin-mining division from an asset into a burden. It has been about a year since President Trump won the election, and the lion's portion of Trump-related rallies has vanished. It might be a controversial question, but I think that the victory of the President who aims to make the U.S. the world's crypto capital is one of the biggest possible catalysts for Bitcoin. Of course it is not impossible, but I do not think that there will be a comparable bullish catalyst for BTC-USD in the near future. I am not saying that Bitcoin will certainly go down further, because nobody can figure out its fair value like we can do for stocks. While there are some positive catalysts for BTC-USD, like institutional adoption and ETF inflow, there are certainly negatives as well. The momentum for BTC-USD looks flawed as it is currently quite far from the last 52-week peak of $126k. Moreover, the U.S. unemployment rate is ticking upward while the country's consumer confidence is declining . Meanwhile, actual inflation is still above the 2% historical average, while interest rates remain high despite the recent rate cuts. If the U.S. unemployment climbs further with people having less residual income to invest in BTC-USD, it will undermine the price due to lower demand. On the other hand, the company's AI infrastructure revenue is expected to soar from almost zero to billions. First and foremost, there is a massive $9.7 billion multi-year AI infrastructure deal with Microsoft. Having a deal like that is certainly a significant positive factor. If IREN successfully delivers on all its obligations to Microsoft, it might be a game changer in terms of the company's reputation as an AI infrastructure player. Overall, the company targets $3.4 billion in annualized AI cloud revenue by the end of 2026 since there are also deals with Together AI, Fluidstack, Fireworks AI. With all these contracts, IREN's AI infrastructure business might thrive. However, it is important to keep in mind that in the previous quarter, this business's revenue was just a few million dollars. Thus, achieving a multi-billion AI infrastructure revenue will mean scaling up exponentially, which means extremely high execution risks. Moreover, let's not forget that meeting all this AI infrastructure demand will mean massive additional capital investments for IREN, which will require raising additional capital. Valuation uncertainty as a two-edged sword IREN soared by around 400% over the last twelve months, which brought its market cap to almost $14 billion. Such a market cap is a quite generous valuation for a company with around $689 million in TTM revenue . Besides IREN's high P/S ratio, other multiples are also significantly higher than the sector median. Therefore, IREN is very generously valued in absolute terms. Seeking Alpha However, there is another important valuation criterion as the forward P/E ratio setup. Wall Street analysts believe that IREN's P/E ratio will be contracting rapidly over the next few years, which is a bullish setup in theory. However, let's not forget that this growth will significantly depend on the Bitcoin mining business. Since Bitcoin is extremely volatile and its price forecast is not something that can be reliably projected, I think that the forward P/E ratio trajectory forecast can change significantly as well. Seeking Alpha A forward P/E ratio forecast of around 17 for FY2028 might look compelling for some growth investors. For a company that has the potential to capitalize on AI infrastructure tailwinds, such a forward P/E ratio does not look very high. Therefore, the forward P/E ratio trajectory might work against my neutral thesis. Bottom line To conclude, I think that IREN is a ""hold."" The forward P/E ratio setup looks attractive and might work against my cautious stance, but it is important to keep in mind the nature of the AI infrastructure business. Achieving ambitious revenue and EPS growth forecasts will require the company to invest substantial amounts in data centers, meaning that there is no guarantee that the EPS and free cash flow dynamic will converge.",IREN,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-11-30 13:15:00

Prices have dipped across the board, sentiment has sunk back into Extreme Fear, and most major altcoins to buy have retraced harder than expected. Yet in the middle of this gloom, one project is generating more noise than anything else on the charts. Digitap ($TAP) , a rising presale with an already active fintech product, has become the unexpected star of the week, thanks to its Black Friday 96 Hours of Madness event with a prize pool of $1M, which has turned into a spectacle. The first two days were packed with the sort of deals most presales never dare to offer. Traders reported grabbing 100% bonus boosts, 7,000 $TAP token drops, cash giveaways, rapid-fire discounts that vanished in seconds, and perks that appeared without warning. Anyone who missed those early windows has spent the rest of the event refreshing the widget with growing FOMO. And with two more days left, the rush is only getting stronger. Digitap Stands Out as the Best Altcoin to Buy in a Market That’s Losing Momentum Digitap’s sudden rise didn’t come out of nowhere. While the broader market has been drifting downward, Digitap has been steadily moving in the opposite direction. What’s unusual, and what traders keep pointing out, is that its momentum isn’t tied to hype cycles or market optimism. It’s grounded in real product utility. The project offers something rare for a presale: a live, working crypto banking app. Users can hold both crypto and fiat, convert between them instantly, and spend anywhere Visa is accepted. The partnership behind this integration means people can use Digitap for everyday purchases, online or offline, without waiting for a future update or roadmap milestone. That alone has made Digitap stand out to analysts reviewing the best altcoins to buy in a hesitant market. It’s not trying to reinvent money from scratch; it’s trying to make money easier to move, hold, and spend. Even more important is how Digitap handles global transfers. While banks still charge an average fee of 6.2% for cross-border payments, Digitap cuts that down to under 1% through blockchain rails. It’s a small detail with a large impact, and one of the reasons early supporters saw the project as the best crypto presale 2025. $1 MILLION in CASH, PRIZES, GIVEAWAYS. BLACK FRIDAY SALE IS LIVE NOW Chaos in the Best Way: What the First 48 Hours Delivered The Black Friday event turned Digitap from a steady-moving presale into the week’s headline. What shocked many observers wasn’t just the frequency of the drops but the variety. In the first two days alone, buyers saw: 100% bonus boosts 7,000 $TAP token bundles Massive cash rewards Short-lived percentage boosts Free product upgrades and early-access features Limited-claim deals that rewarded the quickest buyers The randomness is part of the appeal. No deal repeats, nothing is pre-announced, and each hour resets the board. As a result, traders who missed a good deal early on now feel a different kind of pressure: the sense that the biggest reveal might still be hiding in the final hours. Rumors have added fuel to the speculation. There’s talk of potential metal card drops, hidden perks for repeat participants, or one final oversized bonus before the event ends. None of it is confirmed, and that uncertainty is what keeps investors glued to the widget. Presale Numbers That Hold Up Even Without the Event A Black Friday splash can draw attention, but Digitap’s underlying stats explain why the hype has lasted more than a day. The presale has climbed from $0.0125 in September to $0.0334 today, with the next increase pushing it to $0.0361. The project has already sold 135 million $TAP tokens, raised over $2.2 million, and connected with more than 120,000 wallets, numbers most early-stage projects would love to see in a bullish market, let alone in a fearful one. This combination of real utility and steady growth is why traders researching the best crypto to invest in now keep coming back to Digitap. $1 MILLION in CASH, PRIZES, GIVEAWAYS. BLACK FRIDAY SALE IS LIVE NOW The Final Stretch Could Decide the Entire Narrative As the last 48 hours of the Black Friday event approach, Digitap has captured the kind of attention some of the best crypto presales only dream of. The early deals have already created strong FOMO, and each new hour carries the chance of a bigger drop than the one before it. Digitap has proven it can generate momentum in a market where momentum is scarce. And with the countdown still ticking, the final phase of this event could shape how the project enters 2026 and who captures the remaining opportunities before they disappear. Digitap is Live NOW.

In the analysis, Binance had said that numbers from Chainalysis and TRM Labs showed the exchange handled far larger crypto flows while keeping criminal exposure low. According to the material provided, Chainalysis said the analysis did not come from its team and did not include major crime categories tracked across its datasets. Two days after the post went up, Binance updated the analysis to say it was actually done internally by the exchange itself using Chainalysis and TRM Labs’ raw datasets. The exchange also added details on how it calculated direct links between illicit wallets and trading activity. Chainalysis is now saying all those figures did not include funds tied to ransomware or hacks, and that the method ignored any movement that went through an intermediate personal wallet before landing on Binance. Chainalysis challenges Binance’s method and missing categories Chainalysis released a public message on X saying that it was receiving many inquiries about how its data was used. The firm said, “This analysis was conducted by Binance based on select Chainalysis data. Chainalysis did not conduct the analysis.” The message also said “the data Binance used for their analysis does not appear to include all categories of illicit activity,” pointing to ransomware and stolen funds as examples. Chainalysis then said that “the Binance analysis indicates that it is based on direct exposure only,” which means crime-linked funds that passed through a personal wallet were excluded. The firm did not dispute that its datasets were used. The issue was what parts were chosen and what categories were left out. The clarification arrived at a time when Binance was working to show regulators and the crypto industry that it takes crime risks seriously. The exchange said it stood by the figures in its blog post and that its update on November 19 gave clearer detail on how exposure was measured. Binance crime cases, penalties, operations, and crime-control claims The dispute came in a period where Binance was still dealing with the fallout of its 2023 plea agreement in the United States after it admitted to anti-money laundering failures, unlicensed money transmitting, and sanctions violations, and paid a $4.3 billion penalty. Founder and former CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao stepped down after the plea and later served a four-month prison sentence for failing to keep an effective compliance program. In October, Cryptopolitan reported that CZ received a presidential pardon from Trump. From January 2023 to June 2025, Binance said it cut exposure to illicit funds by 96% to 98% while processing over $90 billion per day and about 217 million trades daily. The exchange described a large workforce of compliance and risk staff. It said 1,280 specialists, representing 22% of its employees, work on risk, compliance, and investigations. It said it handled 240,000 requests from law-enforcement agencies and ran 400 training sessions for investigators worldwide. It also pointed to its work with the Beacon Network and the T3+ program with Tether, TRON, and TRM Labs to identify and freeze illicit funds. The exchange also said it uses AI systems to lower false alerts and improve detection of suspicious flows. Cryptopolitan noted that Chainalysis did not challenge those internal operational claims in its post.

Additionally, XRP tapped a new all-time high in the middle of the year, but it’s now trading below its January 1 price – so why isn’t it thriving? Ripple’s Stellar 2025 Perhaps the most anticipated and important news for Ripple this year came in March when its CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, announced the official end of the prolonged legal battle against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Although it took a few more months and some hurdles for the case to go down in the history books , it was categorized as a win for Ripple, given the small fee it had to pay compared to the $2 billion initially sought by the regulator. This was a pivotal moment for the company, which opened the door for some big moves. Just a month after Garlinghouse’s triumphant statement, Ripple announced the acquisition of the prime broker Hidden Road for $1.25 billion. Months later, the platform was renamed to Ripple Prime and aims to service institutional clients. Reports also emerged that the firm has led an effort to raise at least $1 billion through a SPAC to create a digital asset treasury (DAT) company focused on accumulating its own token, XRP. It separately announced a $1 billion acquisition of treasury software provider GTreasury to strengthen corporate finance relationships. Another major move this year was the purchase of Rail for $200 million, which is a platform built to help businesses move money with “speed, transparency, and trust” using stablecoins and fiat. The closure of the lawsuit with the SEC also meant that the overall regulatory landscape around Ripple and its token had improved drastically. This became even more evident in November when the first spot XRP ETF with 100% exposure to the asset went live in the US. Canary Capital’s XRPC broke the 2025 record for trading volume on its debut day. Moreover, three additional XRP ETFs followed suit, and the four products have attracted more than $660 million in net inflows in just a few weeks of existence. Why Is XRP Down Then? All these developments mentioned above occurred in the span of less than a year. So, one should assume that this particular year would be highly bullish for the underlying asset, right? After all, just the Hidden Road acquisition was described as a “game-changer” for XRP, while experts predicted a massive price expansion once the SEC lawsuits ended and the ETFs went live for trading. And it was, at least until a point. The cross-border token matched its 2018 ATH in January 2025, dumped hard in the following months, but skyrocketed again in July to break it and set a new one at $3.65. So, if the year had ended at that point, it would have been a success. However, what followed was quite the opposite. XRP went on a months-long correction that resulted in a couple of price drops below $2. Although it has managed to reclaim that level, it now trades at $2.20, which is actually lower than its 2025 entry price of $2.32. XRPYTD. Source: YahooFinance So, why is this? Why isn’t the underlying asset moving in line with the company behind it, which had arguably its best year ever? Perhaps the most evident answer lies in the old narrative – buy the rumor, sell the news. XRP began its massive ascent after the US elections last year with the hope of a new, more regulatory-friendly regime in its home country. The promised internal changes at the SEC also led to a massive rally, but once the lawsuit was indeed closed, there were no fireworks. There was no rally after the first ETFs saw the light of day; just the opposite: XRP dropped. Consequently, it doesn’t appear as if XRP’s fundamentals are out of shape. It’s just that financial markets, and crypto in particular, are highly emotional forces still mainly driven by sentiment and crowd expectations.

Inflows into Grayscale and Bitwise’s ETFs were limited in their first week of trading, despite the hype around the first-ever Dogecoin ETFs. But even as ETF inflows sputter, some technical analysts argue that DOGE might still undergo a strong price rally, possibly all the way to $1, if important support levels hold. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s November Slump Could Trigger A 2026 Revival, Analysts Say Spot DOGE ETFs Off To A Slow Start When Grayscale rolled out its Spot DOGE fund (GDOG) on November 24, inflow volume clocked in at just about $1.8 million on the first day, far below the estimates some market participants had forecasted. For example, Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, predicted that the ETF will witness a $12 million volume on the first day of trading. According to data from SoSoValue, net inflows across the DOGE ETFs by Grayscale and Bitwise added up to just over $2.16 million over the course of the initial trading week. This shows that institutional and retail investors are somewhat cautious when it comes to investing in the meme cryptocurrency. This is in contrast to the strong opening inflows seen by other altcoin ETFs, such as those for Solana (SOL) and XRP which were launched in the past few weeks. Furthermore, the lackluster uptake has raised doubts about whether the ETFs will ignite the kind of renewed interest in DOGE that some backers hoped for. Technical Outlook Suggests Bullish Potential To $1 Even though ETF demand is currently tepid, multiple technical outlooks point to a potentially more optimistic outcome for Dogecoin. One technical outlook from crypto analyst Ali Martinez identifies key support at roughly $0.08, with resistance around $0.20. This support level harkens back to a time when DOGE dipped below $0.10, before launching into a multi-month rally to $0.50 after the US elections. Dogecoin Key Price Levels. Source: @ali_charts On X More bullishly, a multi-week technical breakdown done by crypto analyst XForceGlobal suggests that DOGE might be wrapping up a long-term corrective phase and positioning for a fifth wave, which is a powerful upward impulse according to the Elliott Wave Theory. That wave could push prices well beyond current levels, with intermediate targets potentially between $0.33 and $0.50, and a longer-term stretch to $1. Similarly, crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade believes Dogecoin has dropped back onto the same long-term support zone that previously led to major rallies, calling it the launch pad for the next big move. His weekly chart highlights how Dogecoin’s price action has repeatedly bounced from this ascending trendline, producing gains of more than 80%, 210%, and even over 440% since October 2023. Dogecoin Technical Analysis. Source: @TATrader_Alan On X The analyst says the pattern is intact once again, and if the support at $0.15 holds, Dogecoin could follow the same structure into a larger expansion phase. Based on his projection, that continuation would give Dogecoin enough momentum to make a gradual 610% climb to $1 by 2026.

In an X post, Hayes argued that Tether is effectively making a massive interest-rate bet. He urged that it could turn ugly if gold and Bitcoin retreat from current levels. Bitcoin price dipped by 17% over the last 30 days. However, it has managed to recover by around 6% in the last week. BTC touched $91,500 on the last day of November, pushing the crypto market to recover marginally. Tether’s USDT is the biggest stablecoin in the market. It holds the circulating supply of 184.6 billion. Circle’s USDC stands second in the tally with a supply of 76.55 billion. Hayes big warning Hayes’s latest reading of Tether’s situation looked blunt. He highlighted that the company appears to be positioning for Federal Reserve rate cuts . This scenario would erode the yield it earns on its giant pile of Treasuries and cash-like instruments. In order to offset that, Tether has been steadily increasing its allocation to what Hayes calls “hard assets.” It represents roughly $13 billion in gold and close to $10 billion in Bitcoin. According to Hayes’s post , a 30% slide in the value of Tether’s gold-and-BTC bucket would be enough to wipe out the firm’s equity cushion. This can make USDT “in theory insolvent.” He added that some large holders and exchanges are likely to demand a clearer, real-time view of Tether’s reserve quality. The Tether folks are in the early innings of running a massive interest rate trade. How I read this audit is they think the Fed will cut rates which crushes their interest income. In response, they are buying gold and $BTC that should in theory moon as the price of money falls.… pic.twitter.com/ZGhQRP4SVF — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) November 29, 2025 Tether had declared more than $181 billion in total assets. Much of it is in ultra-liquid securities such as Treasury bills, repo, and money-market positions. Reports show that the firm has also expanded into higher-risk categories. This includes secured loans, venture investments, metals, and Bitcoin. S&P Global Ratings slapped the firm with a “weak” stability score earlier this month. The stablecoin issuer replied, calling S&P’s methodology outdated. Crypto volatility cools November has been a rough month for crypto, as nearly $1 trillion got wiped out from the market. Ethereum followed BTC to erase its major gains. ETH price dipped by more than 22% in the last 30 days. It is now down by almost 40% from its all-time high of above $4,900, recorded on August 25. Ether is trading at an average price of $3,011 at press time. Still, there are some signs that the selling pressure is easing now. Derivatives desks say demand for protective downside hedges has cooled sharply. Tether is also dealing with operational headaches. The company confirmed it is shutting down its mining venture in Uruguay. This came after negotiations over electricity pricing broke down. About 30 of its 38 staff in the country are being let go as the business winds down, according to reports.

Traders are watching the pullback intently, although capital is already migrating toward Digitap ($TAP) . Digitap is a live omnibank application that allows users to hold fiat and crypto together, transfer funds instantly, and spend globally with Visa-powered cards. While large-cap coins battle for momentum, the Digitap crypto presale is already 94% sold out in round 2. Digitap is now in the final hours of its Black Friday promotion, where hourly deals and a $1 million prize pool continue to attract new buyers. XRP Under Pressure: Technical Weakness Meets Mixed Sentiment XRP continues its decline, trading around $2.19 after failing to hold $2.29. The daily chart displays a lower high and lower low structure, confirming that the short-term trend remains bearish. Immediate support rests around $2.07, while any relief move confronts resistance between $2.30 and $2.70. RSI has dropped below 50 with no significant divergence, thus momentum still leans toward sellers. If $2.07 breaks, the following demand zone appears in the $1.81–$1.88 area. Meanwhile, the cumulative net inflow across all four U.S. Spot XRP ETFs (Canary Capital, Bitwise, Grayscale, and Franklin Templeton) has reached around $587 million since their inception on November 13. Furthermore, Bank of America revealed that the entire U.S. banking sector will eventually adopt crypto payments . This is a remarkable comment considering its long history as one of Ripple’s initial partners. Even with these drivers, on-chain data still reveals lower activity and decreased payment volume, which explains XRP’s subdued price response. Nonetheless, some traders still believe that XRP is one of the promising altcoins to buy in 2025. The World’s First Omnibank: How Digitap Transforms Global Finance Digitap is a single, regulated platform that unifies traditional banking rails with multiple blockchain networks into a single ecosystem. Users can open global IBAN accounts, hold both fiat and crypto, make quick cross-border transactions, and spend anywhere Visa is accepted, all without leaving the app. Its innovative multi-rail protocol routes each transaction through the most efficient method, whether that means settling on-chain via Ethereum or Bitcoin, or moving off-chain via SWIFT, SEPA, or Faster Payments. An embedded AI layer analyzes liquidity across DEXs and OTC exchanges to assure the best possible execution with minimal slippage. This architecture reduces the friction that still slows most crypto-to-fiat systems. Freelancers receive faster access to earnings, and corporations avoid inflated transfer fees. Moreover, $TAP holders can stake their tokens for up to 124% APR (during presale) and up to 100% APR (post-presale) while receiving cashback and VIP benefits. All these contribute to why $TAP is one of the top altcoins to buy today. Backed by end-to-end encryption, dynamic jurisdictional compliance, and audited smart contracts ( SOLIDProof and Coinsult ), Digitap pairs enterprise-grade security with practical daily utility. This reinforces why Digitap is considered one of the best crypto presales to invest in. $TAP Presale: Black Friday Madness Event Live The current presale stage offers $TAP at $0.0334, with 94% already claimed and only a handful of tokens left before the price increases to $0.0361. More than $2.2 million has been raised, over 135 million tokens have been sold, and more 120,000+ wallets have connected to the site. This is an impressive show of strength during a bearish crypto market. Right now, the “96 Hours of Madness” Black Friday event is in full swing. A new exclusive offer drops every single hour until Monday night, backed by a prize pool exceeding $1 million in bonuses, discounts, free credits, cards, and extra $TAP bundles. Black Friday Drops Intensify as Hourly Bonuses Disappear Already-expired deals included +22%, +40%, +50%, and even +70% token bonuses, plus straight giveaways of 750, 2,222, and 5,000 $TAP tokens. Upcoming drops promise deep percentage discounts and bonus tokens for the first buyers in each hour, meaning the widget's value changes every 60 minutes. This gamified urgency, combined with the looming stage close, has turned the presale into one of the most exciting crypto presales of the year. Secure the Best Crypto to Buy Now Before the Event Ends XRP may eventually profit from persistent ETF inflows and Ripple’s expanding banking network. However, it remains locked in a bearish structure while capital rotates toward promising projects during this Black Friday season. The Digitap application is already live on the Google Play Store and App Store, so anyone interested can download it instantly. $1 MILLION in CASH, PRIZES, GIVEAWAYS. BLACK FRIDAY SALE IS LIVE NOW For those seeking the best crypto to buy now in November, $TAP is ranking high on the list. As the presale demand skyrockets, another price increase is only days away. The Black Friday event adds even more incentive for investors to claim $TAP today. The hourly countdown is active, and participants still have an opportunity to accumulate one of the top altcoins to buy this year before the Black Friday event ends.

According to Hayes, audit data suggests that Tether believes the Fed will cut interest rates in the near term. Hayes noted that in this scenario, interest yields, a key source of Tether's income, would plummet, and that the company is aggressively accumulating gold and Bitcoin to mitigate this risk. “The Tether team is just starting a big interest rate move. Reading the audit, I see they think the Fed will cut interest rates, which will crush their interest income. In response, they're accumulating gold and Bitcoin, which are expected to rise as the currency's value falls,” Hayes said. Related News: BlackRock Makes Statement on Bitcoin: “Outflows Are Natural” However, Hayes argues that this strategy carries significant vulnerability. If this portfolio of gold and Bitcoin loses approximately 30% of its value, Tether's equity could be completely wiped out, theoretically putting USDT at risk of bankruptcy. Therefore, he argued, large investors and exchanges would begin demanding real-time access to Tether's balance sheet. Hayes also stated that traditional media will quickly pick up the discussion, saying, “Get your popcorn ready.” He also suggested that backlash against Howard Lutnick and Cantor Fitzgerald, the names behind Tether, could intensify. *This is not investment advice.

According to CEO Phong Le, the firm would consider selling Bitcoin only if its stock fell below its net asset value and it simultaneously lost access to new capital, he said in an interview with What Bitcoin Did published on November 28. Under those conditions, the executive noted that selling a portion of its holdings would become a defensive step aimed at preserving what the company views as its core metric of Bitcoin yield per share. “That would be a last resort. There’s the mathematical side of me that says that would be absolutely the right thing to do. There is the emotional side of me, the market side that says, we don’t want to really be the company that’s selling Bitcoin,” Le said. The discussion around a potential sale comes as Strategy’s massive Bitcoin treasury continues to post gains. The company now holds 649,870 BTC valued at roughly $59.33 billion. Its average acquisition cost stands at $74,430 per coin, giving it a profit margin of about 22.66% based on current valuations. Despite the appreciation, Strategy’s equity metrics show the stock still trades below the value of its underlying Bitcoin. The company’s basic market capitalization is listed at $51 billion, rising to $57 billion on a diluted basis, while enterprise value sits at $66 billion. Strategy Treasury Metrics. Source: Bitcoin Treasuries Strategy’s business model Notably, the company’s model relies on keeping its stock trading at a premium to net asset value. When that premium exists, Strategy raises equity and converts the proceeds into more Bitcoin, steadily increasing BTC per share. If the premium disappears and new equity becomes too dilutive, Le said selling Bitcoin to meet obligations becomes the logical fallback, even if it contradicts the firm’s long-standing accumulation strategy. Notably, amid the recent Bitcoin price drop, the firm has come under pressure, with some on Wall Street warning that its strategy could falter and calling for it to offload part of its BTC holdings. The pressure stems from rising fixed payouts tied to preferred shares issued in 2025, which carry escalating annual obligations of roughly $750 million to $800 million as different series mature. To this end, the company aims to fund these commitments mainly through equity issuance while the stock trades at a premium, a cycle Strategy believes strengthens investor confidence.

His remarks come as Zcash stakeholders debate leadership continuity, committee independence, and the implications of a changing market environment. Buterin argued that token voting can weaken privacy protections when decision-making power concentrates among token holders, stating that the model performs poorly in areas where long-term preservation is crucial. Vitalik Buterin’s warning sparks governance debate Buterin referenced earlier analyses in which he described token-based voting as susceptible to short-term incentives. He stated that the mechanism is “worse than Zcash’s status quo”. He noted that privacy could erode if the protocol’s future depended on the preferences of what he called the “median token holder.” I hope Zcash resists the dark hand of token voting. Token voting is bad in all kinds of ways (see https://t.co/Cvl7CFVgtc ); I think it's worse than Zcash's status quo. Privacy is exactly the sort of thing that will erode over time if left to the median token holder. https://t.co/NbRqGLOrpj — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) November 30, 2025 His comments followed a set of statements by Zooko highlighting the evolution of Zcash’s governance system. According to Zooko, the structure is built around independent participants who share a common mission despite frequent disagreements. He urged voters to read candidate positions entirely and stressed the idea that the system has built the power of the debate, failures, and input over the years. Zooko also discussed the next election cycle. He affirmed that he will run again next year, citing that he was initially hesitant since he perceives himself to be more effective in a crisis. Nevertheless, in an interview with other committee members, he said he is ready to proceed and has ample time available to make Zcash his priority. He further stated that the committee has been experiencing a surge in dubious grant applications and that it expects the number to continue growing. Nevertheless, he stated that he is determined to conduct a thorough scrutiny of proposals and that he will still treat ZCG funding decisions with the same principles that he applied in previous cycles. He also referred to the increase in the price of ZEC as a new test of governance, because more resources generate both possibilities and threats. He warned that those increased funding levels might result in spending decisions being way too easy. He added that he is still living the way he lived before the price rise lest he lose his discipline. Zooko claimed that there are still some developers who have not been funded to continue their work, and that he believes long-term involvement is crucial to the community’s stability. Competing views on on-chain and committee-based structures Zooko reiterated that he supported various protocol upgrades, such as Crosslink, NSM, and the introduction of ZSA. He referred to these changes as improvements but stated that they must happen at a time that would show the overall judgment of the community. According to him, ZCG is a five-member committee that is fully independent, and no external party interferes with funding approvals. He pointed out the internal functions where Jason worked on the organization, and Zerodartz helped in community activities. These comments by Buterin led to further commentary by Naval Ravikant and community member Darklight. Naval claimed that trusted intermediaries are structural and asked all the decentralized protocol governance to be on-chain and private. Darklight did not agree and said that ledgers needed to be trustless. However, research and development decisions were based on the judgment that automated systems cannot deliver. He claimed that on-chain funding is governed by trends of capital domination or voter apathy and stated that, in his opinion, ZCG serves a filtration purpose in quality control.

Their $750 million WLFI token private placement with World Liberty Financial, plus warrants, means WLF can eventually own about 52% of ALT5 Sigma Corporation. Pre-deal shareholders were diluted from 21.6 million shares to 109.6 million, and to 9.5% ownership on a 228.6 million fully diluted share base. In my view, ALTS has mostly become a play on WLFI’s token price going forward. Yet, the token itself has an unclear cash-flow model. Still, investors bullish on the WLFI token may find ALTS compelling due to its implied discount. But, on balance, I feel a neutral stance for ALTS makes sense. ALT5 Sigma Corporation ( ALTS ) is a B2B crypto-infrastructure company that provides tokenization, trading, payments, and custody platforms. Its main customers include banks, brokers, and large merchants. ALTS offers crypto-as-a-service (CaaS) with API plugins for crypto products without requiring building wallets, trading engines, compliance stacks, or custody systems. ALTS agreed to a $750 million WLFI token private placement with World Liberty Financial that can give it around 52% of the company if it fully exercises its warrants. Thus, ALTS is now a bet on the WLFI token, so unless you’re bullish on that token, then ALTS is not worth the risk at these levels. Crypto-As-A-Service ALT5 Sigma Corporation is a small-cap fintech company that provides crypto-as-a-service infrastructure aimed mainly at institutional clients. ALTS was founded back in 2018 and is headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada. Broadly speaking, ALTS provides technology for organizations that allows its customers to integrate with cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. The company also offers tokenization services to generate digital tokens on a blockchain. Source: ALT5 Sigma Corporation Website. Retrieved November 2025. As a quick overview, ALTS provides tools and platforms for trading crypto and software for clearing and settlements. For merchants, it allows them to accept crypto as payment and safekeeping of digital assets for customers, including secure wallet infrastructure. In that sense, crypto-as-a-service is a back-end crypto infrastructure business that allows banks, brokers, payment companies, and large merchants to plug into ALTS’ system (via APIs) and receive crypto functionalities. All of this without the need to build complex and expensive full in-house systems. Essentially, if a bank wants to let users buy and sell cryptocurrencies, instead of creating an exchange, they can simply call ALTS’s APIs. Alternatively, if a payment processor or online store wants to accept USDT, ETH, or BTC at checkout, it can instantly convert those coins into USD or EUR through ALTS’s payment API. In the same way, ALTS provides trading, pricing, and custody on behalf of a broker or a wealth platform. Source: ALT5 Sigma Corporation Website. Retrieved November 2025. Moreover, ALTS’s key platforms and products include ALT5 Prime and ALT5 Pay that target B2B use cases rather than direct retail trading. ALT5 Prime is a platform for institutional and professional customers to trade and manage digital assets. This means ALTS offers liquidity, execution, and custody services as well. As for ALT5 Pay, this is a crypto payment gateway that lets merchants accept crypto and auto-convert to fiat, with plugins like WooCommerce, checkout widgets, and APIs. How One Deal Reshaped ALTS More recently, in August 2025, ALTS signed the Securities Purchase Agreement [SPA] with World Liberty Financial, Inc. The deal consisted of a private placement of $750 million in WLFI tokens at $0.20 each. To honor the private placement agreement, ALTS had to get the approval of shareholders across several related proposals. By October 2025, shareholders had voted and approved those proposals. The first proposal was about the issuance of 119 million common shares upon exercise of the pre-funded and common stock purchase warrants held by World Liberty Financial, Inc. This was necessary to remain in compliance with NASDAQ Rule 5635 . This rule is a set of requirements that tells NASDAQ-listed companies when they must get shareholder approval before issuing new stock or equity issued for acquisitions and similar deals. In the ALTS’ case, Rule 5635 is relevant on two fronts. Source: ALT5 Sigma Corporation Website. Retrieved November 2025. You see, ALTS previously received $750 million in WLFI tokens (associated with WLFI) and, in exchange, agreed to issue a block of equity that exceeds the 20% threshold of outstanding shares. Therefore, the transaction had to be approved by shareholders for that reason. Also, under the same Rule, if World Liberty Financial exercises all those warrants, it could own 52% of ALTS common stock. So, if that were to happen, it would basically become a change of control scenario, which is another condition that typically requires a shareholder vote. The second proposal was to allow the Board to name a second director, elected by the Lead Investor, which reinforces its influence. This appointment may also be considered part of the change of control, so it needs shareholder approval. The third proposal is for authorizing the increase of the number of common shares from 200 million to 2,000 million. This is more of a housekeeping move to ensure ALTS has a cushion of authorized shares for future financings, acquisitions, stock-based incentives, and additional digital-asset purchases. Having said that, it has been noteworthy that ALTS quickly restructured its top management. From November 21 to 25, the board removed the CEO, the CFO, and the COO, and accepted the resignation of one independent director. On paper, all these changes aligned with the current board’s strategy. In practice, ALTS installed Tony Isaac as the new acting CEO and Steven Plumb as the new CFO. Tony Isaac continues as President and Director. But, interestingly, this restructuring has concentrated more power within a smaller group that includes Tony Isaac, Steven Plumb, and Zachary Witkoff (WLFI’s cofounder). Furthermore, in September 2025, a Seeking Alpha news report by Max Gottlich analyzed the ALTS-WLFI deal structure. The report described the transaction as a “circular deal” that benefits the Trump family. Source: ALT5 Sigma Corporation Website. Retrieved November 2025. In any event, as far as ALTS is concerned, the bottom line is that ALTS has $750 million in cash and $750 million in WLFI tokens. I also believe ALTS used a portion of the $750 million in cash it received to purchase more WLFI tokens (more on this later). And, in the process, ALTS pre-raise shareholders got diluted from 21.6 million shares outstanding to 109.6 million shares outstanding post-deal. On top of that, WLFI also received 99.0 million pre-funded PIPE warrants and 20.0 million stock purchase warrants. That means ALTS' fully diluted shares outstanding are actually closer to 228.6 million (109.6m + 99.0m + 20.0m). Therefore, this transaction also implies that the original shareholders with 21.6 million shares outstanding now own just 9.5% of the fully diluted shares outstanding (21.6m / 228.6m). The report mentioned that this deal puts entities linked to the Trump family on “ both sides ” of the trade. After all, a Trump family-controlled entity ( DT Marks DEFI ) reportedly owns a stake in WLFI, which makes it proportionally beneficiary of the WLFI token sale proceeds (to ALTS). And World Liberty Financial can own up to 52% of ALTS if all warrants are exercised, which the recent shareholder vote now allows. Source: ALT5 Sigma Corporation Website. Retrieved November 2025. Naturally, this deal means that ALTS now has substantial exposure to WLFI tokens. These tokens can potentially become very valuable, as they’re the governance token for the WLFI ecosystem. This governance token has a say on items like protocol parameters or treasury decisions for the ecosystem. This could become a sort of proxy play to USD1’s stablecoin adoption. In theory, if this stablecoin becomes widely used, then the ecosystem will generate considerable fees. And WLFI could become proportionally valuable compared to how much value and fees this on-chain mechanism generates. However, remember that ALTS only owns around 7.5% of WLFI’s fully diluted token supply. So, in practice, ALTS pre-transaction shareholders got diluted down to 9.5% and received 7.5% of WLFI’s token governance in exchange. Valuation And Risk Analysis Now, from a valuation perspective, ALTS trades at $1.87 PPS . Since there are 228.6 million shares outstanding, that implies a fully diluted market cap of $427.5 million. In my view, it’s prudent to use the fully diluted market cap in this case because there’s essentially little stopping WLFI from exercising its warrants (aside from the NASDAQ’s change of ownership rule). So, the best way to think about ALTS’ valuation is that you’d be buying into a 9.5% stake of the fully diluted entity. Source: ALTS press release on token holdings. Moreover, we don’t have an updated Q3 2025 10-Q report, so we have to do some speculative calculations. Basically, as of Q2 2025, ALTS was doing $6.4 million in quarterly revenues and -$2.1 million in operating losses. Their pre-transaction balance sheet held $9.6 million in cash and short-term investments, against $22.7 million in financial debt (aside from other operating liabilities). And its book value stood at $33.1 million. With that in mind, post-transaction ALTS essentially added $750 million in cash and $750 million in WLFI tokens at $0.20 per token (i.e., 3.75 billion WLFI tokens). However, we later learned that ALTS increased its WLFI token holdings to 7.28 billion tokens. So, I infer ALTS used a portion of the $750 million in cash it received to purchase 3.53 billion WLFI tokens. We don’t know the average price of those purchases, but I’ll assume it was $0.18 as cited in the press release. That would imply ALTS spent around $635.4 million out of the $750 million in cash it received. So, I add the remaining $114.6 million to its Q2 cash balances and estimate its liquid resources are probably closer to $124.2 million. And today, each WLFI token trades at $0.16 , meaning ALTS’ WLFI token holdings are worth approximately $1.2 billion. Source: CoinGecko . Token: WLFI. I also estimate ALTS burned through $5.2 million during Q2 2025 . Note that I got this figure by simply adding its quarterly cash flows from operations and CAPEX. And if we annualize that number, it suggests a yearly burn rate of roughly $20.8 million. So, pre-transaction, that would have translated to a concerning cash runway of just 1.8 quarters. Post-transaction, ALTS' cash runway is probably closer to 6.0 quarters, excluding the mark-to-market value of its sizeable WLFI token treasury. But note that WLFI’s circulating token supply is about 27.2 billion, so ALTS owns 26.8% of the circulating supply. And the token’s trading volume is $128.6 million, so if ALTS ever wants to liquidate its position, it would probably realize a much lower value than the mark-to-market figure of $1.2 billion. Also, I would imagine that if ALTS discloses its selling WLFI tokens, it would probably hurt investors’ confidence in the token itself. Plus, the lower the WLFI token trades, the lower its trading liquidity by extension (at ceteris paribus). Naturally, I doubt ALTS plans on selling a substantial amount of its WLFI tokens any time soon, especially since it’s part of its CaaS strategy. Nevertheless, putting it all together, it’s challenging to make a compelling bullish case for ALTS at this point. After all, the WLFI token itself doesn’t directly generate any cash flows. All we know is that the most recent USD1 attestation report ( WWLFI's native stablecoin ) mentions there are around $2.7 billion worth of USD1. In theory, WLFI could benefit from fees or spreads within this ecosystem, but there are no disclosed figures about this so far. Thus, in practice, ALTS has a huge amount of speculative WLFI tokens that don’t generate any disclosed cash flows. It also appears highly illiquid relative to ALTS’ mark-to-market treasury. Source: Bitget Wallet. WLFI Token Unlock Schedule. So, if the WLFI token continues to depreciate ( down 31.6% over the past year), then ALTS stock will probably trend lower as well. Alternatively, if you’re truly bullish on the WLFI token and its ecosystem, then I do believe ALTS is the best way to express that view. The market is clearly discounting its WLFI token value if we value ALTS’ treasury mark-to-market. And if the WLFI token succeeds and appreciates, then the market should reprice ALTS’ treasury closer to its mark-to-market value. In that hypothetical bullish scenario, ALTS’ $427.5 million fully diluted market cap would seem like a bargain today. Still, I think this scenario is highly speculative, especially after considering the overhang on the WLFI token supply that’s yet to be unlocked. Conclusion: Not Worth The Risk Overall, ALTS has gone through a major restructuring event. It’s now mostly a bet on crypto defi and CaaS. They’ve also partnered with WLFI, which already has a $2.7 billion stablecoin ecosystem with USD1. However, they haven’t disclosed any concrete figures about how WLFI will generate cash flows for tokenholders like ALTS. Effectively, this means that ALTS’ main asset can only benefit shareholders if it holds its value or appreciates. Yet, I have my doubts about that because WLFI is a thinly traded crypto with the vast majority of its max supply still waiting to be unlocked. Also, ALTS can quickly change its ownership if the WLFI company fully exercises its warrants, further diluting shareholders. Conversely, ALTS can make sense for investors who are bullish on the WLFI token itself since ALTS’ treasury appears below-par relative to its mark-to-market valuation. But, on balance, I don’t see a compelling risk-reward equation for new shareholders, which is why I lean towards a “Hold” at these levels.",ALTS,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-11-30 14:00:00

According to the analysis, approximately 56 billion XRP is classified as liquid, with only about 9–11 percent actively circulating and available for purchase. Grok’s observations focus on how ETF acquisitions could absorb this portion of XRP and what the resulting supply changes might imply for the market. Estimated Timelines for ETF Absorption Grok’s projections outline three potential scenarios. At the current purchase rate, ETFs could absorb 9–11 percent of liquid XRP within roughly 17 months. A more aggressive accumulation rate would shorten the timeline to about 14 months, while a highly aggressive purchase pattern could accomplish the same in just eight months. These scenarios reflect the current pace of ETF purchases and provide a framework for understanding how quickly liquid supply might be reduced. Groks thoughts on $XRP supply vs demand with XRP ETF's So to summarise; There is roughly 9-11% of available 56 B liquid XRP circling in the wild. How long would it take for $XRP ETFs to absorb this? {Note ; I do not believe this take's into account the remaining 16 {?}… https://t.co/tPB9yJAk3X — Ripples (@Ripplesinwales) November 28, 2025 Additional Demand Factors Ripples emphasizes that these projections do not fully account for the potential launch of up to 16 additional ETF providers . If these providers enter the market, institutional demand could rise significantly beyond the modeled scenarios. Grok also points to decentralized finance and other emerging demand vectors as contributing factors that could accelerate the absorption of liquid XRP. While unexpected market developments may influence outcomes, the combined data suggest that a substantial portion of the circulating supply could be removed within the next year. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Supply Shock Considerations The analysis references the well-known Shane Ellis supply shock theory, which posits that a rapid reduction in liquid XRP could affect price dynamics. Grok and Ripples note that while the exact market impact is uncertain, the potential for a notable contraction in available supply is clear. The research raises the question of how these supply constraints might influence XRP’s market value as institutional and other forms of demand continue to grow. In summary, Grok’s insights, as reported by Ripples, give a structured look at XRP’s supply under rising ETF demand in the crypto market. If current trends persist and new sources of demand emerge, the circulating liquid supply could contract significantly within the next 12 months, potentially creating conditions consistent with a supply-driven market shift.

Fast forward a few weeks, and its value has plummeted from around $178 billion to $122 billion. The former top crypto to buy has fallen out of grace as multiple data points indicate slowing momentum. Meanwhile, crypto presale project Digitap ($TAP) continues to surge ahead despite ongoing bearish conditions. Digitap is the company behind the world’s first “omni-bank” and is celebrating a milestone raise this Black Friday weekend. Digitap’s Utility Keeps It On Best Crypto To Buy Now Lists Digitap is the company behind the world’s first-ever “omni-bank,” combining crypto and traditional finance on a single platform. The bank app is live on mobile devices and in a web browser, and it can send, receive, store, and invest in crypto and cash in one account. Digitap recently partnered with Visa so users can spend their crypto or fiat at any merchant that accepts Visa cards. One of the ways Digitap is looking to differentiate itself is by beating banks and legacy financial institutions at their own game. Money remittance providers, for example, can charge users an average of 6.2% to move funds across borders because they hold a near-monopoly. But Digitap is looking to challenge the status quo with peer-to-peer transfers that could come in as low as sub-1%. Around 800 million family members worldwide rely on remittances sent by 200 million migrant workers. This implies roughly one in eight people globally are impacted by high remittance fees. A potential savings of 5 percentage points or more translates to more money in the pockets of those who need it most. The case for Digitap to be named a top altcoin to buy is grounded in the reality that investors appreciate platforms with real-world utility in large, underserved markets. If Digitap can capture even a small slice of the global remittance flow, it could validate its business model and sustain long-term growth. Source: Digitap 3 Reasons Tiered Pricing And Black Friday Deals Lift Demand Digitap’s ability to demonstrate real-world use cases and a working app during the presale stage makes it worthy of inclusion on the list of top altcoins to buy. Unlike most early tokens that promise future use, Digitap is proving its business model upfront, which helps explain why the presale of its native $TAP is attracting so much interest. Digitap’s crypto presale kicked off in late summer as part of a tiered fundraiser at $0.0125. The price of $TAP increases once each stage is sold out and is currently for sale at $0.0334. Investors need to act fast as the current round is 90% sold out and scheduled to increase to $0.0361. Digitap recently surpassed the $2 million raised milestone earlier than expected. This is due to the strong early participation and incremental demand from investors looking for guaranteed price increases during a market selloff. To help celebrate its fundraising milestone, Digitap introduced a gamified twist this Black Friday weekend. Until Monday, new bonus offers will continue appearing every single hour on the presale site. Some hours bring discounts or extra token bonuses, others provide fee credits or special perks. Some of the more recent deals include a bonus 7,500 $TAP, a 22% additional $TAP top-up, and more. $1 MILLION in CASH, PRIZES, GIVEAWAYS. BLACK FRIDAY SALE IS LIVE NOW BNB Loses Momentum As Chain Activity And Volumes Decline BNB’s price has plummeted nearly 22% over the past month alone as the former top crypto to buy has lost all momentum. The token is also down sharply from its all-time high of around $1,370, currently trading at around $880. The selloff isn’t without reason. Data from DefiLlama shows BNB Chain’s daily transactions have been slashed by nearly half to 15.1 million in November. Network utilization is down around 20% and decentralized exchange volumes are down over 20%. Still, there are reasons to remain optimistic that BNB could make its way back onto a list of top cryptos to buy. Notably, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s review of VanEck’s proposed spot BNB ETF remains ongoing. BNB has several potential catalysts in 2026, including performance upgrades to support institutional-grade DeFi and AI applications. Source: DefiLlama Digitap’s Startup Valuation Offers More Upside Than BNB Now With BNB’s continued price struggles and catalysts only expected next year, retail investors appear to be looking elsewhere for upside. Digitap is a natural home for investors, as it provides a few overlapping services while offering much higher upside potential. In fact, early investors have already profited tremendously from BNB’s rise over the year. The token is up a mind-boggling 750,000% since its creation, despite the recent slump. As such, expectations for outsized gains moving forward are limited. The best-case scenario is that BNB doubles in value over the next two to three years as momentum returns and upgrades to its network pay dividends. By contrast, Digitap is a top crypto to buy because it offers a compelling alternative to the outdated and expensive financial ecosystem. It also trades at a startup-like crypto presale valuation that the market has overlooked, but this won’t last much longer as its investment narrative gains additional credibility with each new user it onboards.

In November 2025, as volatility wreaks havoc on portfolios and the market bleeds out, one crypto presale has defied gravity the entire time. Digitap ($TAP) , a rapidly growing omnibank ecosystem, is bridging crypto, fiat, and global payments. Its current presale round is now over 90% sold out, attracting whales, retail buyers, and fintech-focused investors. In the meantime, giants like Cardano (ADA) and memecoins like Dogecoin (DOGE) are struggling to hold support levels in the bear market. Fear is rising, liquidity is drying, and most presales are not breaking even. However, Digitap’s story is completely different. $TAP is selling out fast because investors see it as a rare utility-driven crypto presale ADA is stable but stagnant Dogecoin’s weak ETF debut highlights fading memecoin demand While other early-stage tokens rely on hype, Digitap is thriving as a real financial infrastructure project, and the market has noticed. Why Digitap Keeps Surging While the Market Sinks The general crypto market has been sliding throughout November, with most large coins testing lower levels. Altcoin liquidity has evaporated, and retail money has exited the market. Despite the bearish environment, Digitap continues to sell at a speed that even experienced crypto analysts did not expect. Smart money behaves differently whenever the markets are dominated by fear. Instead of investing in volatile coins like ADA or DOGE, serious investors look for crypto presales that blend adoption potential, real-world financial relevance, utility, and defined monetization paths. Digitap checks all those boxes. Digitap is not selling empty promises; it is creating a multichannel banking ecosystem. Its omni-bank ecosystem comprises on/off-ramps, crypto + fiat accounts, borderless banking services, and a Visa-integrated spending network. These foundational financial services help bridge crypto to the global financial ecosystem. Thus, Digitap is attracting capital when the rest of the crypto landscape is sinking. The growing demand has convinced experts to consider $TAP as a good crypto to buy this year. Why Smart Money Sees $TAP Crypto Presale as Undervalued Most presales crumble when fear intensifies in the market. However, Digitap is unbothered and is outperforming all major presales in the market. Investors rush to buy the project because they see $TAP as a safe, undervalued entry point before major catalysts come in. Integration with Visa is a huge milestone for Digitap. It will make it a functioning neobank where users can spend crypto like cash, convert digital assets automatically at checkout, and use a unified financial app for every transaction. The real-world utility gives Digitap an edge over ADA and DOGE, which are transactional only in the crypto space. Hence, $TAP is one of the best altcoins to buy today. Cardano Faces Mainnet Glitch Amid Tight Price Consolidation For years, Cardano has positioned itself as a high-utility blockchain promising long-term stability. Nonetheless, on November 21, 2025, a “malformed” transaction on the Cardano mainnet resulted in a technical failure that split the blockchain's history. Although the blockchain did not halt, there was a huge gap between block productions. This incident was claimed by a staking pool operator named Homer J. The incident did not cause any major price changes. ADA has entered a tight consolidation phase after dropping consistently in the past month. The token’s price action is showing a rare sign of patience after several weeks of volatility. Cardano’s ADA seems to be moving within a defined range. Long-term holders are holding strong. However, exchange inflows remain muted, indicating that buyers are not routing ADA via centralized exchanges currently. If ADA defends the $0.40 support, a 25% surge could happen in the coming weeks. But if the support breaks, the token could head lower. Investors Eye Real-World Financial Rails Over ADA’s Stability ADA is a major token in the market, but it is not the asset currently attracting new money. Digitap is enjoying attention because it solves problems Cardano was never designed to resolve. The omni-bank project is developing a consumer-facing financial network. For those investors who want to shift from a large-cap coin trading sideways to a crypto presale building real financial rails, Digitap is a great investment opportunity. DOGE Faces Bear Market Pressure, $TAP Attracts Smart Money On November 25, 2025, Grayscale’s spot Dogecoin ETF (GDOG) launched with about $1.4 million in first-day trading volume . This amount is way below the $12 million Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas had projected. The debut did not match the expected excitement for the first spot fund to track DOGE directly. This performance shows that investors are cautious and hesitant to invest in the memecoin in the current bearish market. Dogecoin is tied to speculation, meaning new capital avoids it in a bear market and long-term holders exit. While the memecoin struggles near $0.15 , Digitap offers a structured financial ecosystem that appeals to smart money. Its merchant systems, banking layers, payment rails, and Visa integration create recurring utility. Thus, investors who previously bought every DOGE dip now consider Digitap as the best altcoin to buy due to its lower risk and higher growth potential. $TAP Stands Out Amid Bearish Crypto Markets Digitap is benefiting since the market is moving from hype to utility. Its omni-banking ecosystem, payment infrastructure, and financial tools make $TAP essential to platform operations. Even at 90% sold out at the current round, Digitap is deeply discounted compared to its possible post-launch value. Interestingly, the Visa integration represents credibility that most crypto presales struggle to achieve. Digitap’s architecture offers a massive growth potential, explaining why whales are buying aggressively at its early stage. While ADA and DOGE struggle in the current bear market, Digitap is building its foundation, user base, ecosystem, and investor community.

The project exceeded $2.2 million in early funding because it offers real technology and makes crypto spendable. Moreover, it merges institutional partnerships and product readiness. Currently available at $0.0334, $TAP’s entry price and growth potential explain its massive demand in a bear market. At least 133 million $TAP tokens have been acquired. The current value is a 76.15% discount from the launch price of $0.14. Digitap’s momentum has also been enhanced by its 96-hour Black Friday presale. After the first 24 hours of this Black Friday sale, inflows have skyrocketed, and investors are buying $TAP aggressively. Everyone appears to be in a rush to take advantage of discounts, giveaways, hourly bonuses, and impressive rewards of up to $1 million.

The South Korean exchange will now restart operations in installments. Upbit will begin a phased resumption of deposits and withdrawals on December 1 at 1 PM KST following a $36.8 million Solana network hack. Upbit suspended services after a North Korea-linked hack The platform initially suspended all of its services due to a security breach on November 27 that resulted in the unauthorized withdrawal of approximately 54 billion Korean won ($36.8 million) in SOL, USDC, and more than 20 other Solana-based assets, such as BONK, JUP, RAY, ORCA, RENDER, PYTH, and TRUMP. The exchange detected abnormal withdrawals of various cryptocurrencies on the Solana network at approximately 4:42 AM Korean Standard Time on November 27. The hack occurred one day after Naver Financial announced a 15.1 trillion won ($10.3 billion) acquisition of Dunamu, Upbit’s parent company, in an all-stock merger expected to be completed in June 2026. Once the attack was detected, Upbit immediately suspended all deposits and withdrawals across its platform and moved remaining assets to cold storage to prevent further losses. The exchange successfully froze $8.18 million worth of LAYER tokens and continues working with projects and authorities to freeze additional stolen funds. Upbit’s CEO, Oh Kyung-seok, said that the exchange would cover the entire amount using its own reserves, ensuring no customer would experience personal losses. Upbit has been hacked before, in 2019 when the attackers made away with 342,000 ETH. South Korean authorities have indicated they suspect that both the 2019 attack and the most recent hack were carried out by the Lazarus Group, a North Korean state-sponsored hacking organization. South Korean government officials believe that the hackers compromised administrator accounts or impersonated administrators to authorize the transfers. Blockchain analysis shows that the hacker’s wallet swapped Solana for USDC and then bridged funds to the Ethereum network, in what seemed like an attempt to hide the trail . According to blockchain security platform Immunefi, Lazarus was responsible for over $300 million in losses across crypto hacking incidents in 2023, representing 17.6% of the year’s total losses. Services will be restored in phases Upbit is set to resume its deposit and withdrawal services starting December 1, 2025 following a November security breach that led to the suspension of services. Upbit’s initial restoration efforts will target network assets like Akash Network’s AKT and Ethereum ecosystem tokens such as 1INCH, AAVE, and ADT. Users will need to verify updated addresses and monitor their funding status because every asset will migrate to a new deposit address. The exchange has not provided a timeline for when all cryptocurrencies will have their deposit and withdrawal services fully restored, but it has indicated that services will resume gradually as each asset completes its security verification. Users who already had funds on the platform have been able to trade on the exchange as normal throughout the suspension period, but users were unable to transfer funds into or from the exchange during that same period. The Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) has launched an on-site inspection of Upbit, and the review is expected to continue until December 5.

Dogecoin, the first meme cryptocurrency, is now displaying technical strength in rebounding from an important long-term support area, defining its long-term trends over the past few years. The reason behind the renewed interest in Dogecoin could be its inclusion in regulated ETFs. Furthermore, a fundamentally driven newly emerging project in the crypto space, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , has secured the attention of sophisticated investors, who are quickly approaching a critical phase in the project’s presale. While DOGE may seem like an interesting development in terms of its momentum, the purposeful development and quickly nearing investment window in the case of MUTM provide a compelling argument in and of themselves, making it an excellent choice among the best crypto to invest in. Dogecoin’s Resilience Dogecoin is currently propping up a strong convergence zone, where the long-standing horizontal support line crosses a major upwards trendline since July 2023. This region has acted as a magnet for buying on several occasions when the price has fallen, and the present action does indeed reflect strong support and a resultant bounce. Beginning with the parody token and culminating in the listing among other ETF-approved blue chip holdings, the Dogecoin experience has exemplified some remarkable changes. When such a technical indicator maintains the trend, it could mean relief on the short run in the $0.18 range. Yet such an asset price keeps on fluctuating in relation to social media network trends and influencer endorsements, keeping the volatility levels higher than would be the case in others dependent on developments in the protocol. Mutuum Finance Presale Begins Final Countdown While Dogecoin struggles in the charts, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) keeps setting actual marks that prove the platform’s validity and potency. The Mutuum Finance pre-sale is quickly nearing the end of the complete sales figure in Phase 6, the phase through which $19,020,000 has been raised by the growing number of 18,250 members. The spot price here is set at $0.035. With over 95% completed in Phase 6, the opportunity to get the tokens at this price is the last chance. Phase 7 will go live at a 20% increased price of $0.040, and the project gets even closer to the $0.06 launch price. This provides a short window in which the investors can position themselves before the launch and make large gains, potentially over 400%, making it an important choice among those researching the best cryptocurrencies to invest in. Aside from the financial mechanics, Mutuum Finance appears to build on a strong foundation for the long run. The Mutuum Finance project has engaged in an extensive, independent security audit by Halborn Security, the prominent player in the field of blockchain security. This proactive measure ensures that the contracts related to lending and borrowing functionalities on the protocol are scrutinized for weaknesses even before the deployment on the mainnet. In the eyes of those evaluating the best crypto to invest in, this focus on the functionality and risk management aspects, in relation to the clear and quickly advancing presale, speaks volumes. The last tokens available at $0.035 are selling out quickly, and it has become the pressing moment for those aiming to take advantage of the prelaunch offer. Securing Position Before the Leap The cryptocurrency market has numerous avenues through which one can witness growth, ranging from technically rebounding cryptocurrencies such as Dogecoin to fundamentally strong newcomers like Mutuum Finance. While the technicals in DOGE do seem quite encouraging, the advanced presale phase accompanied by the unswerving focus on security through auditing in the latter make it a strong candidate among the newcomers in the world of cryptocurrency. Acting quickly in the case of the latter would be advisable for those looking to ride this prelaunch wave.

New data shows that both asset classes have recorded their first net-positive inflow week since October, and this might be an early sign that institutional appetite may be stabilizing after a difficult month for the leading cryptocurrencies and their ETF products. On the other hand, inflow data shows that the recently launched Solana and XRP ETF products continue to attract steady institutional capital. Bitcoin And Ethereum ETFs Break Their Outflow Streak Spot Bitcoin ETFs quietly reversed their month-long downturn with roughly $70 million in net inflows during the final week of November. According to data from SoSoValue , this is the first positive inflow week since late October, putting an end to a four-week streak of redemptions that had removed about $4.35 billion worth of outflows from those funds. Notably, most days of the just-concluded week were defined by low activity in Bitcoin ETFs, but the $71.37 million inflows on November 28 were enough to make the week a positive close. The return of net-positive flows, even on a moderate scale, indicates that some institutional desks may be rebuilding exposure to Bitcoin. Total Bitcoin Spot ETF Net Inflow. Source: SoSoValue Ethereum saw an even more notable change in flow numbers. Net inflows into Spot Ethereum ETFs climbed to about $312.62 million in the just-concluded week, ending a three-week stretch of redemptions that had drained more than $1.74 billion from issuers. The size of Ethereum’s rebound stands out because the price of the leading altcoin had been under more intense pressure than Bitcoin throughout most of November. The fresh inflows point to a noticeable change in sentiment, especially among institutions that had previously paused ETH accumulation. Total Ethereum Spot ETF Net Inflow. Source: SoSoValue Solana And XRP ETFs Maintain Positive Run Even as Bitcoin and Ethereum struggled through weeks of outflows, the newly introduced Solana and XRP ETFs never lost momentum. Spot Solana ETFs are now on a five-week inflow streak, with a further $108.34 million inflow last week. Interestingly, Spot Solana ETFs experienced $8.1 million in outflows on Wednesday to end a 21-day inflow streak, but this was insufficient to cause a net outflow week. Spot XRP ETFs, though launched more recently , have followed a similar trajectory. They are now on a three-week run of consistent inflows, with another $243.95 million added last week, its highest weekly inflow so far. Another Spot XRP ETF is set to go live soon, as 21Shares recently confirmed that its US Spot XRP ETF has secured SEC approval and will begin trading on Monday, December 1. This builds upon the increasing appetite from investors looking for more crypto exposure outside of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Zeberg, who described the current market situation as an “Everything Bubble,” summarized what will happen in the coming period as a two-stage “shock wave”: First, a massive peak, then a historic collapse. Zeberg, known for his analysis of market cycles, stated that economic indicators are sounding the alarm. The economist likened the current situation to that of the 1930s, preceding the Great Depression, saying, “We are heading towards one of the worst recessions we will see since the 1930s.” According to Zeberg, the economy is currently doing its “last dance” and the clock is approaching midnight, the moment of crisis. Zeberg, who also shared the Bitcoin predictions that investors are most curious about, painted a very optimistic picture in the short term and a pessimistic picture in the long term: Parabolic Rise: He expects Bitcoin to peak at $150,000 towards the end of the year or just before the new year. Crash Scenario: In the crisis that will follow this peak, Zeberg pointed out that Bitcoin has never seen a “real recession” before and warned that the price could fall below $10,000. Related News: BlackRock Makes Statement on Bitcoin: “Outflows Are Natural” Zeberg argued that stock markets (the S&P 500 and Nasdaq) are in a massive bubble, and that Bitcoin is highly correlated with these markets. The economist, who claimed that stock markets could experience losses exceeding 95% when the crisis begins, explained this with the metaphor of “the Titanic starting to fill with water.” The bottom 75% of the economy is struggling right now. The Titanic is filling with water, and third-class passengers are the first to see it. This will be a 'serious storm' that will not erupt on the front lines of banks like in 2008, but in the private credit system and shadow banking. Zeberg noted that this scenario is not a horror movie, but a result of macroeconomic data (leading and lagging indicators). *This is not investment advice.

The Form RW submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission confirms that the firm will not proceed with the product and that no shares were issued under the earlier S-1 filings. While some observers interpreted the move as a setback for XRP-related investment products, crypto analyst Ripple Bull Winkle offered a different interpretation focused on broader industry dynamics rather than the withdrawal itself. People are freaking out over CoinShares withdrawing their $XRP ETF filing… but they’re missing the entire plot. This isn’t bearish at ALL. Small issuers step aside when bigger players are about to dominate a market — and XRP’s ETF lane is filling with heavyweights like… pic.twitter.com/bVUXizxhDn — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) November 28, 2025 Analyst Perspective and Interpretation According to Ripple Bull Winkle, the withdrawal should not be considered bearish for XRP in any respect. He argued that smaller issuers typically step aside when the market is on the verge of being led by larger, well-capitalized asset managers. His view is that CoinShares’ exit reflects a shift in competitive positioning rather than any negative sentiment toward XRP. He pointed out that major institutions such as 21Shares, WisdomTree, Fidelity, and BlackRock are actively preparing their own XRP ETF offerings, indicating that the product category is transitioning toward firms with the scale and infrastructure to meet institutional demand. The analyst emphasized that this environment tends to push out lower-capacity participants while reinforcing the presence of firms capable of operating large, liquid exchange-traded products. In his assessment, CoinShares’ withdrawal aligns with the pattern observed in other maturing ETF markets where consolidation begins before major issuers launch their products. Further Market Context The language in CoinShares’ Form RW reinforces that the withdrawal is procedural and linked to a transaction that was not ultimately executed. This provides clarity on the administrative side, while the competitive context outlined by Ripple Bull Winkle adds perspective on what the move may signal for the XRP ETF landscape . If larger issuers are preparing to take leadership roles, the market may see fewer entrants, more concentration among firms with established ETF operations, stronger distribution channels, and deeper liquidity support. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Such consolidation typically influences product pricing, liquidity formation, and the speed at which new ETFs reach sustained volume. In this case, the analyst suggests that the withdrawal represents a realignment in favor of institutions that have the capacity to drive long-term growth in XRP-based investment products. CoinShares’ withdrawal is formally documented and straightforward from a regulatory standpoint, but its implications extend beyond paperwork. Ripple Bull Winkle frames the decision as a normal part of the competitive cycle, with smaller players stepping back as larger institutions prepare to enter the market. If his commentary proves correct, the XRP ETF landscape is shifting toward a phase led by major asset managers capable of supporting significant capital flows.

It shows that true investors never turn a blind eye to the “possibility of changing the status quo”. What we are about to demonstrate is a strategy adopted by savvy capital worldwide. It doesn’t require you to be a tech expert or to monitor the market day and night. At its core lies the perfect combination of three elements: artificial intelligence (wisdom), systems (discipline), and computing power (execution). Think back: When was the last time you were suddenly awakened from your sleep, instinctively reaching for your phone just to check the direction of the candlestick chart on the screen? If you’ve experienced this, then you’ve fallen into the trap of the “manual investment era.” Your time and energy have become your biggest investment costs. Now, imagine you own a fully automated “profit engine” that runs 24/7: Perception and Decision-Making Layer (AI)： Through real-time intelligent algorithms, it continuously analyzes multi-dimensional data (such as transaction pool congestion and network hash rate changes) and outputs the optimal mining strategy instructions. Execution and Coordination Layer (System): Receives AI instructions and precisely schedules underlying computing resources to complete the entire automated process from mining pool switching and load balancing to revenue reinvestment. Resource and Entity Layer (Computing Power): Distributed hardware facilities are responsible for ultimately performing hash calculations and are the physical foundation for the entire technical architecture to generate stable cash flow. This “engine” is CryptoEasily , a cryptocurrency mining platform regulated by the UK’s FCA. You don’t need to build it yourself; you just need to trust it little by little. Becoming a savvy investor only takes three steps: Activate the system: Register an account and start “passive income” (register to receive a $15 bonus). Fuel injection: Deposit digital assets such as BTC, ETH, and USDT. Start the engine: Choose a transparent revenue plan. Partial Revenue Plan： Beginner’s Plan: Contract period is 1 day, minimum investment is $15, total return is $15 + $0.6. Basic Plan: The contract period is 6 days, the minimum investment is $600, and the total return is $600 + $47.52. Stable Plan: Contract term is 10 days, minimum investment is $3,000, total return is $3,000 + $426. Premium Plan: Contract term is 28 days, minimum investment is $25,000, total return is $25,000 + $12,250. Click here to select a plan. Check your daily earnings anytime. Your role will now be upgraded from a tired “trader” to a composed “capital allocator” .

Attention is turning to SOL, TON, and HBAR. Could these cryptocurrencies be primed for growth? Or is the overall market facing a liquidity crunch? This article delves into the current scenario, analyzing whether these coins are ready to surge or if investors should brace for tighter conditions. Solana Eyes Modest Gains Amid Volatile Market Source: tradingview Solana (SOL) is seeing moderate fluctuations, currently trading between $120 and $143. Despite a rough month with a fall of about 29%, SOL has shown a slight recovery recently, climbing approximately 7% in the past week. The nearest hurdle is at $155, and breaking through could lead SOL towards $178, marking a potential increase of around 25% from its current high. Support is solid at $109, which offers some stability. The RSI suggests the coin is neither overbought nor oversold, hinting at potential for growth. While the market is still shaky, with a 100-day moving average slightly above current prices, investors remain cautiously optimistic. Toncoin's Roller Coaster: Price Dips Sparking Interest Source: tradingview Toncoin is bouncing between $1.33 and $1.73, showing mixed movements. Recently, it rose by just over 5% in a week. However, over the past month, it has dropped by nearly 28%. The six-month view reveals it lost almost half its value. It's above the support level of $1.18 but struggling to break past $2.00. If it manages to rise above this, it could touch $2.41. This represents a significant potential jump from the current range. The RSI is balanced, indicating no extreme conditions, while the MACD suggests a mildly bearish scenario. Investors watch closely for signs of a breakout or further dips. Hedera (HBAR) Poised for Potential Surge Despite Recent Dips Source: tradingview Hedera (HBAR) is currently trading between 13 to 16 cents. Lately, it saw a near 11% rise over the past week, but it's still down by 28% this month. If HBAR can break past the 18-cent resistance level, the 21-cent mark could be the next target, suggesting a rise of roughly 30% from its lower range. However, it has a safety net at around 11 cents, which could support it if prices dip. The coin's recent trends and moving averages spark hope for possible growth. With a current RSI at about 49, the momentum hints at potential but isn’t overly bullish yet. Keep an eye on these critical levels for more significant breakthroughs. Conclusion SOL, TON, and HBAR have shown promise in the market. However, overall liquidity seems to be diminishing. Their future role will depend on various market factors. Their performance will require close monitoring. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

It has been touted as a reward system expected to mitigate the blowback from future liquidations, thereby encouraging liquidity and risk management. According to a recent X post from dYdX , the plans for compensation have been approved via a governance vote and will be viewed as a measured experiment, which means it could still be refined further. The post revealed that 32 out of 42 Active Set validators and 112 accounts voted, with a 63.09% voting turnout in which there were 77.34% Yes votes, 2.55% No votes and 20.11% Abstain votes dYdX approved the Liquidation Rebates Pilot Program with a reward pool of up to $1 million for liquidated traders. Source: Mintscan More about the plans for compensation The Liquidation Rebates Pilot Program proposes a one-month trial starting on December 1, 2025, that will reward traders who experience a liquidation event with points and rebates, with rewards capped at $1 million in total. Eligible participants can accumulate the described rewards via the pilot’s structured framework, designed to provide tangible value to active traders while maintaining a transparent process. The scheme’s total incentive pool of up to $1 million has been praised as a measured approach to supporting liquidity and risk management within the platform. dYdX moves on from October network outage dYdX’s plans to compensate traders come after the exchange was affected by a chain halt that grounded operations for about eight hours amid last month’s market crash. It was in the post-mortem and update that followed that the exchange first floated the idea of voting on compensating affected traders with up to $462,000 from the protocol’s insurance fund. dYdX has claimed that the October 10 outage stemmed “from a misordered code process, and its duration was exacerbated by delays in validators restarting their oracle sidecar services.” According to the DEX, when the chain resumed, “the matching engine processed trades/liquidations at incorrect prices due to stale oracle data.” It further reported that no user funds were lost on-chain; however, some traders suffered liquidation-related losses while services were grounded during the halt. dYdX is not the only exchange that has taken proactive steps following the October 10 market crash; Binance’s response to the turmoil has also been commended. The market crash, which wiped out roughly $19 billion in positions and was the largest liquidation event in crypto history, also tested Binance’s trading services as the exchange had to deal with surging volatility, user concerns, and regulatory attention. It was called out for technical glitches that prevented traders from closing out positions, and there were also interface problems that showed several tokens priced below zero, and the depeg of Ethena’s USDe . Binance refused to assume any liability for traders’ losses. However, it announced a $400 million relief initiative for affected traders, including $300 million in token vouchers and $100 million for ecosystem participants who were affected. Binance also launched a $45 million BNB token airdrop to memecoin traders that suffered losses during the crash to “boost market confidence.” In total, the exchange pledged $728 million for traders affected by the sell-off.

Investors and traders are closely watching digital assets like AAVE, UNI, and CRV. These tokens are at a critical juncture, sparking debates on whether a powerful breakout is imminent or if a deeper decline is on the horizon. Aave (AAVE) Experiencing Volatility: Will It Hit New Highs? Source: tradingview Aave's price is bouncing between $150 and $184. Recently, it climbed over 16% in a week, showing strong potential. However, the last month saw a dip of roughly 19%, and the past six months marked a downturn of 25%. The current price sits below the 10-day and 100-day averages, reflecting ongoing uncertainty. Resistance lies at $200, with a further challenge at $234. Support remains at around $133 and stronger at $99. Aave's RSI is under 50, indicating a mixed mood among traders. A push beyond $200 could see significant gains, up over 30% from its lower support if the market turns bullish. Uniswap Struggles, Eyes Future Gains Amid Market Volatility Source: tradingview Uniswap (UNI) is currently moving between $5.29 and $7.57. Despite recent declines over days and weeks, and a dip over six months, a bullish wave could soon emerge. The nearest resistance stands at $9, which is around 23% above current levels, while support is at $4.44, about 25% down. The coin's Relative Strength Index, almost at the middle, shows balanced buying and selling pressures. The Simple Moving Average for 10 and 100 days remains close, hinting at possible price consolidation soon. If investors gain confidence, UNI could reach its second resistance at $11.29, which would mean impressive gains of over 50% from current levels. Curve DAO Token on Recovery Path Amid Fluctuations Source: tradingview Curve DAO Token is currently trading between $0.35 and $0.44. It has struggled in the past month with a drop of about a fifth in value. However, it's bounced back in the past week with a 13% boost. The token is finding support at just above the $0.30 mark and may face resistance at the $0.49 level. The RSI sits in the mid-range, suggesting no strong buying or selling trend. If it breaks the $0.49 resistance, it might aim for the next target around $0.58, a potential rise of over a quarter of its current value. Momentum indicators show mixed signals, hinting at cautious optimism for recovery. Conclusion Current market indicators suggest that AAVE, UNI, and CRV appear oversold. Technical analysis shows potential for a breakout. However, market trends and investor sentiment may influence further price movement.

Prices teeter on the edge as a vital support level is tested. If this barrier shatters, the drop could deepen, causing ripples across the market. This article delves into the fragile state of Ethereum and highlights which coins might surge amidst the potential turmoil. In an ever-changing environment where narratives and attention rapidly pivot, achieving timely interventions and maintaining sustained visibility are crucial. Consequently, data-driven agencies such as Outset PR do more than track token prices; they also closely monitor the broader media landscape. For example, Outset Data Pulse provides up-to-date intelligence on crypto media performance, significantly boosting the efficacy of PR campaigns. Ethereum Eyes Growth Potential Amid Price Fluctuations Source: tradingview Ethereum is showing signs of growth after a dip, with its current price sitting between the mid-two thousands and just over three thousand dollars. The price has risen by about eight percent over the past week, suggesting potential for further upward movement. If it rises beyond the current resistance level of nearly thirty-five hundred, it might climb towards the second resistance level of just over four thousand dollars. This could mean a significant jump of around 30% from its current position. While Ethereum’s price has fallen over twenty percent in the past month, it has grown by over twenty percent in the last six months, hinting at a possible rebound. PR with C-Level Clarity: Outset PR’s Proprietary Techniques Deliver Tangible Results If PR has ever felt like trying to navigate a foggy road without headlights, Outset PR brings clarity with data. It builds strategies based on both retrospective and real-time metrics, which helps to obtain results with a long-lasting effect. Outset PR replaces vague promises with concrete plans tied to perfect publication timing, narratives that emphasize the product-market fit, and performance-based media selection. Clients gain a forward-looking perspective: how their story will unfold, where it will land, and what impact it may create.

Each campaign is calibrated to match the client’s specific goals, budget, and growth stage. This is PR with a personal touch, where strategy feels handcrafted and every client gets a solution that fits. Outset PR’s secret weapon is its exclusive traffic acquisition tech and internal media analytics. Proprietary Tech That Powers Performance One of Outset PR’s most impactful tools is its in-house user acquisition system.

Case in point: The careful selection of media outlets has helped Outset PR increase user engagement for Step App in the US and UK markets. Outset PR Engineers Visibility That Fits the Market One of the biggest pain points in Web3 PR is the disconnect between effort and outcome: generic messaging, no product-market alignment, and media hits that generate visibility but leave business impact undefined. Outset PR addresses this by offering customized solutions. Every campaign begins with a thorough research and follows a clearly mapped path from spend to the result. It's data-backed and insight-driven with just the right level of boutique care. Conclusion If the key level breaks, ETH could see a significant drop. This could impact its position in the crypto market. Other coins like BTC, ADA, DOT, and SOL might gain more attention if this happens. Investors may look for safer alternatives. Monitoring market trends and key levels is crucial. The outcome depends on how ETH reacts in the coming days. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

This level could indicate the potential for a significant upward trend. Eyes are now on whether XRP will break through and soar, possibly reaching $4. The article explores the factors and other coins positioned for promising growth. XRP Edges Upward with Potential for Further Gains Source: tradingview XRP is currently priced between $1.82 and $2.29, showing some upward movement. This month, it has lost about 14% in value, but it’s up over 11% this week. The closest resistance level is at $2.53, which could push XRP significantly higher if breached. Support holds strong at $1.58, suggesting a safety net against sharp drops. If XRP breaks through the second resistance at $3.01, it might see a substantial rise. With levels like this, a potential leap of about 30% is on the radar. Indicators like the Relative Strength Index suggest XRP isn't overbought yet, hinting at more room to climb. Conclusion XRP faces a key resistance level, and breaking past it could signal a strong upward move. If it manages to overcome this barrier, a rally towards $4 seems feasible. The performance of other major coins such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin will also impact its trajectory.

These factors have weighed on prices, but they also leave the system healthier, less levered, more neutral in positioning, and increasingly anchored by fundamentals. ETF Demand Fades Amidst Shallow Liquidity Recent data compiled by CoinMetrics shows that major absorption channels have weakened. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have experienced multi-week net outflows of $4.9 billion since mid-October, the largest redemption cycle since April 2025, while DATs are seeing cost-basis pressure that compresses their premiums to NAV and limits their ability to raise capital or increase crypto holdings per share. Michael Saylor-led Strategy, the largest DAT holding 649,870 BTC at an average cost of $74,333, has slowed accumulation as its equity valuation softened, similar to a broader cooling across treasuries. At the same time, leverage has reset across futures and DeFi markets following the October 10th liquidation cascade, which erased over 30% of perpetual futures open interest in hours and pushed OI well below pre-crash highs. Funding rates have drifted toward neutral or slightly negative, and DeFi lending has seen a similar unwind: active loans on Aave V3 have declined since late September, with the sharpest contraction in stablecoin borrowing after Ethena’s USDe depegging triggered a 65% drop in USDe loans. ETH-based borrowing, including WETH and LSTs, declined by 35-40%, amidst reduced looping and lower leverage appetite. Spot liquidity has yet to recover, and top-of-book depth for BTC, ETH, and SOL is still 30-40% below early-October levels. This has kept markets more fragile and vulnerable to outsized price moves. Liquidity conditions in altcoins remain even weaker, which is indicative of persistent risk aversion and reduced market-making activity. CoinMetrics observed that this internal reset is taking place against a macro backdrop that remains a headwind as uncertainty around rate-cut expectations, weakness in technology equities, and a broader risk-off tone have tempered appetite for digital assets. Primed for Recovery? Bitcoin’s recent divergence from gold, which is up over 50% year-to-date, and the loss of momentum in AI-driven tech stocks highlight how changing macro conditions have influenced sentiment. While these pressures have weighed on prices, they also leave the market in a more neutral, less levered state, as positioning gets cleansed and systemic vulnerabilities are reduced. A steady recovery in the major demand channels such as ETF inflows, renewed DAT accumulation, and stablecoin supply expansion, alongside a rebound in spot liquidity, would provide the foundation for stabilization and eventual reversal. Until these elements turn, markets will continue to be shaped by the tension between an unfriendly macro regime and a crypto market structure that is internally healthier but still waiting for stronger demand to return.

Investors Rush Into MUTM Ahead of the $0.06 Launch,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/the-next-big-altcoin-under-0-075-investors-rush-into-mutm-ahead-of-the-0-06-launch/,"More investors are now shifting their gaze to a new altcoin that trades at a rate much lower than $0.075 and the growth is accumulating at a rapid pace. As the official launch price will be $0.06, and the demand could be gaining momentum every other day, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) may become one of the most prominent competitors in the crypto sphere in Q4 2025. Most traders are convinced that this could be one of the last opportunities to enter, before the next great pricing level comes. Mutuum Finance Presale Development Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has demonstrated a good trend in the year 2025. The project was opened at a price of $0.01 in the beginning of this year and is already reaching the price of $0.035, which is 250% more in the offering cycle. The investor confidence has increased consistently pushing the presale into deep allocations. It has already raised $19M, and it has over 18,200 holders within its community. The total 4B MUTM supply consists of 1.82B tokens going to the presale. More than 800M tokens are already bought at the earlier stages. Phase 6 is already crowded and there is a little bit of supply left before the next crypto price change. The heightened popularity is nothing more than a trend: market participants are willing to have a first hand grasp at a new cryptocurrency that is characterized by sound development gains, open audits and substantial application. The urgency has also been developed through the launch price of $0.06, buyers are well aware that the present stage of entry is at $0.035, which could not last very long. What Mutuum Finance Is Forging Mutuum Finance is developing a lending and borrowing platform based on decentralization. The protocol assists in structured lending by way of collateralized borrowing, yield models and dynamic interest modeling. The system uses the use of the m tokens which is a yield bearing receipts. As users post assets they get mtTokens which gain value as borrowers pay interest. This bond yields to actual lending rather than token artificial inflation. The buy-and-distribute mechanism is one of the most powerful options of the platform. Part of protocol money is spent purchasing MUTM in the open market. The open market of MUTM is repurchased and issued to users staking the mtTokens to the safety module. This will provide steady purchasing influence and reinforce demand for the token in the long run. Security has also been prioritized. Mutuum Finance is under review by Halborn Security , has passed a CertiK audit with a score of 90/100 on the Token Scan, and the lending and borrowing agreements are going through a review. These audits allow splitting MUTM among a wide range of early-stage tokens which enter the market without being verified. Having solid fundamentals and application in the real world of DeFi, Mutuum Finance is rising to become a remarkable project among new altcoins, with prices lower than $0.075. Stablecoin Growth The lending ecosystem will also be boosted with Mutuum Finance creating its own stablecoin. The stable coin will be minted and burned when required and will be pegged to USD. Stablecoins are also critically important in the lending of DeFi due to the ability to borrow and to go into a deeper liquidity mindset or mode. Another such significant section of the platform is accurate pricing. To provide the accuracy of liquidation and safer borrowing, Mutuum Finance will incorporate Chainlink oracles, fallback oracles and on-chain data feeds support. Such systems will assist in maintaining the platform stable even when the market is volatile. Owing to the solid design and quick presale action of the project, some analysts are confident that MUTM may upsurge upon reaching its launch price of $0.06 with potential targets of between $0.25 and $0.35 based on the consumption by the platforms and the increase in users. Although predictions cannot be certain, the reasons are encouraging with regards to optimism of Mutuum Finance. V1 Launch and Increased Urgency As it is known, the V1 will launch on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 according to the official X account , which will mark a significant step that Mutuum Finance makes. This edition will consist of the liquidity pool, mtTokens, a debt-tracking token and the liquidation bot, so that soon users will have tools to act upon. In the meantime, Phase 6 is about to become fully allocated. And just a little percentage of tokens are still on the $0.035 mark and new whale entries, such as a purchase of over 100K, have put larger demands on it. The presence of whales at the end of an offering is usually an indication of great confidence and usually hastens with which the final supply is depleted. As the investors seek the most favorable cryptocurrency under $0.075, they are moving rapidly since upon the closure of the Phase 6, the token moves nearer to the launch value of $0.06. The early entry window is shrinking at a very high pace. Mutuum Finance could become one of the hottest new altcoins by Q4 2025. Between powerful DeFi dynamics, obvious audits, growing investments, a price that has grown by 250%, a nearly complete Phase 6 allotment and a forthcoming V1 discharge, the dynamic is gaining traction at a swift rate.

All of the ten biggest bitcoin mining companies were in the green zone, defying market expectations. After Bitcoin jumped over the $90,000 mark, mining companies felt the positive effects immediately. The crypto king was trading at $86k midweek and reached a top above $92k on Friday. BTC is up by 7.3% in the past seven days and is currently exchanging hands at $90.8k. Bitcoin mining stocks rise 5% Public bitcoin miners closed the week at a total market cap of $69.1 billion, up by 5.04% in 24 hours. Data collected from bitcoinminingstock.io shows that CleanSpark (ticker: CLK) and Bitfarms (ticker: BITF) gained 12.26% and 12.25% in a single day. Canaan (ticker: CAN) and Soluna Holdings (ticker: SLNH) were among the biggest gainers too, posting gains of 9.78% and 9.61% on the day. IREN Limited (ticker: IREN) ranks number one among other bitcoin mining companies in terms of market capitalization. The company had a strong year-over-year (y-o-y) revenue based on its released fiscal year report. IREN signed a $9.7 billion contract with Microsoft to power GPU-based AI cloud computing services at its Texas data centers. At the time of writing, IREN has a market cap of over $13 billion, but its stock dropped by 1.32%. It closed trading at $47.81. Cipher Mining (ticker: CIFR) ranks second with a market cap of more than $8 billion. CIFR went up by 6.26% in 24 hours and by 43.81% in five days. It closed trading at $20.35. Cipher inked a 10-year high-performance computing (HPC) deal with Fluidstack. The company will provide an additional 39 megawatts (MW) of critical IT load at its Barber Lake site in Texas by early 2027. The deal with Fluidstack was the main driver of CIFR in the past week. Applied Digital Corporation (ticker: APLD) ranks third with 8.66% daily gains and a 28.49% weekly jump. The company completed Phase II of its “Polaris Forge 1” AI-data-center campus in Ellendale, North Dakota. Applied Digital’s 100 megawatt (MW) building is now operational at full load. The APLD stock closed trading at $27.10. Market cap heatmap. Source: BitcoinMiningStock . TeraWulf jumped by 37.37% in one week TeraWulf (ticker: WULF) is in the fourth position with a market cap of over $6 billion. The company released its earnings for Q3 of 2025 and reported an 87% jump in year-over-year earnings of $50.6 million. TeraWulf earned $7.2 million from high-performance computing (HPC) leases. It ended the quarter strong with $712.8 million of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. WULF rose by 4.51% on Friday and closed the week with a 37.37% jump. Riot Platforms (ticker: RIOT) has a market cap of $5.9 billion, placing it fifth by market cap. RIOT climbed by 7.67% in a day and finished the week with gains of 26.90%. At the end of October, Riot reported $180.2 million in Q3 revenue, with $104.5 million in net income. The company mined 437 bitcoins in October and currently holds 19,324 BTC. RIOT closed last week at $16.13. Core Scientific (ticker: CORZ) and Hut 8 (ticker: HUT) rank sixth and seventh by market cap. CORZ jumped 4.38% in 24 hours and 14.66% in five days. HUT, on the other hand, saw a positive 6.20% in one day and 31.04% in the whole week. Core Scientific disclosed the rejection of CoreWeave’s merger bid. Back in August, Hut 8 said it would work on four new U.S. sites to deliver 1,530 megawatts (MW). Those sites are located in Texas, Louisiana, and Illinois. The capacity at each site will vary from 50 megawatts (MW) for small sites up to 1,000 megawatts (MW) for major sites. CORZ closed the week at $16.89, while HUT finished trading at $45.0. Public bitcoin miners continue to expand because investors are valuing them for their HPC/AI opportunities. The focus isn’t on hashrate anymore but rather on their energy utilization. “The AI battle for dominance is a battle being had by the biggest and best capitalized companies in the world and they care like their lives depend on it that they win,” said Greg Beard, former CEO of Stronghold Digital Mining.

According to RBC, NBK Chairman Timur Sülümenov said the institution would wait for “the dust to settle a bit” following the sharp market correction. Sülümenov stated that the investment would be financed directly from the Central Bank's foreign exchange reserves, not from the National Wealth Fund. In his statement, Sülümenov stated that the planned investment amount was not certain and used the following expressions: “This doesn't mean we've taken $300 million and are investing it right away. Maybe we'll limit it to 50 million, maybe 100 million, maybe 250 million. After the sharp decline in the entire crypto market, returns, monetization, and risks need to be reassessed.” The crypto market has lost $500 billion in total value since the beginning of November. Bitcoin's price has fallen 17%, from $110,000 to $81,000, its lowest point in seven months. Related News: Renowned Macroeconomist Issues “Final Warning” to Bitcoin Holders The NBK Chairman said that an investment portfolio linked to high-tech stocks and digital financial instruments has already been created within the Central Bank reserves, but there will be no rush to make new crypto investments: “After this decline in digital and crypto assets, we need to let the dust settle in the market. We will not make any hasty decisions.” In early November, Sülümenov told Bloomberg that the country would establish a national crypto fund of up to $1 billion. The fund would reportedly invest in more traditional, auditable structures like exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and shares of crypto companies. *This is not investment advice.

BitMEX Co-Founder Calls Protocol Another Berachain,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/monad-price-to-crash-99-another-berachain/,"The Layer 1 blockchain Monad has grabbed the headlines in the past few days following its successful launch earlier last week. MON, its native token, enjoyed a significant 80% surge on the back of the launch, hitting an all-time high of 0.048 on Wednesday, November 26. While the Monad protocol has enjoyed significant attention since going live, it appears that not everyone is confident in its potential adoption. Most notably, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes has put forward a pessimistic outlook for the project, saying its token value could fall as much as 99%. Monad Has No Real Use Case: Hayes In a YouTube interview with Altcoin Daily, Hayes stated that any other Layer 1 blockchain besides Ethereum and Solana is “zero” and is not going to do very well. Using Monad as an example, the former BitMEX CEO described the protocol’s coin as another “high FDV, low-float” token. Related Reading: Solana Braces For A Dual-Test Setup – Here’s What Could Happen Next Hayes said that Monad is going to be the new “Berachain” and expects its native token’s value to fall by 99% after the initial jump. Berachain, which launched in February 2025, has its native token BERA trading beneath $1, nearly 94% beneath its all-time high of $14.83. As of this writing, the Monad token is valued at around $0.0285, reflecting an over 40% decline since hitting its all-time high on Wednesday. Hayes highlighted that every new project’s token often enjoys an early price spike before facing a deep correction, as there is usually no real use case to back up the initial growth. The crypto founder noted that it is a classic case of FOMO (fear of missing out), especially after the massive success of Ethereum. Hayes said in the interview: Every coin gets their first pump and people want to believe in the new L1. Everybody wants to invest in the new Ethereum like they would have in 2014 when everyone missed it. Me included. But again, that doesn’t mean it [Monad] is going to actually have any real use case. Moving forward, Hayes went on to pick a “magnificent five” of protocols currently in the cryptocurrency space, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, ZCash, and Ethena. If Not Layer 1s, What Next? It is little surprise that ZCash made it to the BitMEX co-founder’s list of top blockchain protocols. According to Hayes, ZCash and other privacy-focused coins—like Monero—will dominate the crypto narrative even more in the coming year. Related Reading: Ethereum Fusaka Will Be ‘The Most Bullish Upgrade’ Ever, Pundit Claims Additionally, Hayes mentioned that Zero Knowledge (ZK) proofs and quantum resistance are other crypto narratives to watch out for in 2026. Specifically, the crypto founder noted that the next winner in the crypto market over the next one to two years would come from the ZK space.

According to the latest on-chain data, the flagship cryptocurrency seems to be entering a critical zone, which could see its price rebound with more momentum in the near future. On-Chain Data Suggests Bitcoin Price Could See Rebound Soon In a November 29 post on the social media platform X, crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed that the Bitcoin price might be entering a “low-risk” zone. According to the market pundit, this low-risk area has often offered solid potential buying opportunities for investors. This evaluation revolves around the Sharpe Ratio, an on-chain indicator that assesses the risk-adjusted returns of a specific crypto asset (Bitcoin, in this case). This metric basically evaluates the amount of profit an investment offers per unit of risk (considering risk is measured by volatility). Typically, a rising Sharpe Ratio indicates a higher risk-adjusted performance, meaning the asset generates greater returns compared to the risk undertaken. On the other hand, when this metric is in a downward trend, it implies that the coin is in a “lower-risk zone” and the returns are becoming less significant. As shown in the chart above, the Bitcoin Sharpe Ratio has been on a sharp downturn , approaching the low-risk region (the green area). Within this area, the market leader tends to offer lower returns and is often less susceptible to unexpected volatility-driven price movements. Historically, the low-risk zone has been where long-term investors “buy the dip,” as they look to make less risky decisions in the market. Moreover, as observed in the highlighted chart, the Bitcoin price bottomed out (as seen in late 2022) when the Sharpe Ratio entered the low-risk zone. In essence, the Bitcoin price could be preparing for a market rebound as the Sharpe Ratio hovers around and below the zero threshold. Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap Flashes Green Again Another on-chain metric that adds further credence to the Bitcoin price rebound hypothesis is the Coinbase Premium Gap . This indicator measures the difference between the BTC price on the US-based Coinbase exchange (USD pair) and the global Binance exchange (USDT pair). When the Coinbase Premium Gap is positive, like it currently is, the metric implies that US-based investors are buying Bitcoin aggressively. Ultimately, this demand pressure from American investors could provide the buoy that the Bitcoin price currently needs. As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $90,940, reflecting a mere 0.4% jump in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Sharpe Ratio|btc|btc price|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-30 16:30:35

WGMI's top holdings are shifting assets to AI and cloud contracts, improving cash flow prospects after years of mining-related losses and dilution. The ETF's recent outperformance is tied to these strategic shifts, but its stated focus on BTC mining creates uncertainty for investors. Given the fund's unclear direction, I rate WGMI a neutral Hold until management clarifies its approach to balancing BTC mining and AI/cloud exposure. CoinShares Bitcoin Mining ETF ( WGMI ) has had a good 2025, on the heels of strategic pivots by its holdings. These take the holdings outside of WGMI's intended purpose, and that makes it tough to be sure of what kind of bet this ETF is: BTC mining or AI and cloud servers. Concept of the Fund Actively managed, WGMI invests in companies that either derive most of their revenue from Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining or in developing some kind of good or service that enables BTC mining. This is a way to invest in the future of BTC, with extra upside from the success of the miners. Bitcoin miners are companies that, generally speaking, host and operate a fleet of ASIC machines, which are custom-made to meet the computational needs of solving a block on the blockchain. This earns them rewards that produce more BTC. ASIC miners are typically purchased in large volume and installed in large data centers. Few companies fit the description of a BTC miner, so WGMI has only 24 holdings overall, and the top ten holdings account for 90% of the portfolio. Top 10 Holdings (Author's Display of Fund Page Data) This means that the financial profiles of these holdings should tell us a lot about WGMI's viability as an ETF. Historical Results Since its inception in February 2022, WGMI is up about 73%, but most of these gains only occurred in the last few months. Prior to that, the fund had a losing record. WGMI Full Price History (Seeking Alpha) The reason is pretty simple. BTC miners are infamously unprofitable, and this owes to the never-ending arms race of mining computers. Part of this relates to Bitcoin's hash rate and how it affects mining. As summarized on SwanBitcoin.com: A higher hashrate indicates the need for more computing power, increased energy costs, and longer verification and transaction times. This results in slower and more expensive Bitcoin mining. This is a feature, not a bug, intended to make BTC more secure from attack by making the computational demands higher. Growth Of Hash Rate Over Time (CoinWarz) The trick for the miners is that they continually incur more capex to get more advanced ASIC hardware, which increases global participation in the blockchain, which increases the hash rate, and therefore increases the need for more computational power. It's a mouth that can never quite be fed. Each batch of ASICs is only truly competitive for a few years, and they aren't useful for any computing needs besides mining BTC. Miners have burned cash through ASIC capex well in excess of their operating cash flows, assuming OCF is even positive in the first place. This is easy to see if we sample the annual cash flow statements from the top three holdings. Cash Burn In Holdings (Cash Flow Statements In Annual Reports) As they run out of cash, they must sell more shares to raise capital. This dilutes existing shareholders and reduces the intrinsic value of an individual share over time, which will hurt the returns of ETFs that hold them. That explains WGMI's weak result until this year. Outlook and Risks The part of the results where WGMI became a net winner leads to a discussion about the fund's future: a transition from BTC mining to AI data centers. One might wonder why they would do that in 2025, the year that the federal government finally adopted a crypto-friendly stance, seen earlier with the passage of the GENIUS Act. It really comes down to the fact their mining sites, often consisting of large warehouses of hardware, have built up very efficient electrical capacity, and the data center needs of AI have created an alternative use for these assets. The holdings have made announcements of moving in the direction of supporting AI hyperscalers: IREN's $9.7B contract with Microsoft ( MSFT ) CIFR's $3B contract with Fluidstack BITF's conversion of their Washington site WULF's 25-year lease with Fluidstack HUT's sale of Canadian assets to TransAlta HIVE's long-term deal with Dell ( DELL ) I think these developments are good for a fund like WGMI, at least in the sense that there's more likely to be positive cash flow in the future with these types of deals. BTC mining was proving to be a tough business particularly after 2024's halving event hurt their production. Repurposing the assets for AI and cloud data centers is a model that's already been proved, and this shift explains why these stocks rose and pulled up WGMI too. Nevertheless, the fund's self-description is still about exposure to BTC mining, and so a moment of reckoning is ahead. ETFs often have to change their entire framing at moments like these, changing their name and ticker. If not, then it's possible that WGMI will double down and concentrate on stocks that retain their focus on BTC mining. Conclusion There is a fork in the road, where very good things and very bad things can happen. This depends on how WGMI's management wants to handle the split between BTC mining and AI/cloud opportunities. Because of this, I give the fund a neutral Hold. Management needs to be clearer on how they want to tackle the paradigm shift that occurred among its BTC miner holdings.",WGMI,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-11-30 16:42:28

Information flows unevenly, and founders rarely get enough time to explain their vision in full. That’s why earned media — especially tier-1 coverage — becomes a form of public due diligence for investors. Agencies that work inside this environment, such as Outset PR, see the pattern regularly. A project with a visible, credible media trail enters investor conversations with less friction and a bit more authority, while one without it often has to argue for legitimacy from scratch. Turning coverage into confidence is surprisingly straightforward, though it requires founders to treat press as strategic evidence rather than decoration. Tier-1 Mentions Could Serve Early Validation Investors rely on trusted sources to filter noise. When a crypto project appears in Forbes, VentureBeat, or Investing.com, it signals that editors have already examined the narrative and chosen to publish it. That external review creates a small but meaningful lift in trust. A clean slide with a few tier-1 logos, a short quote from a respected journalist, or a link to an interview often reshapes the mood of a pitch deck. It shows you’ve already been examined by someone with no stake in your success. That alone helps reduce the mental temperature of a room. But sometimes, placing a logo of Forbes on your website is not enough. If misused, it can create hype without substance. Outset PR prompts founders to showcase their strongest signals while understanding the finite goal. How Outset PR Uses Earned Media Coverage to Strengthen Narrative Coverage is most valuable when it reinforces what you already claim. If a reporter explains your positioning in a sharper or more impartial way, borrow it. If an article highlights what you do well, integrate it into your story. Investors are sensitive to recurring themes, so when a founder’s narrative and a journalist’s assessment align, the message feels sturdier. Commentary pieces often leave stronger impressions than feature articles. When journalists ask your team to explain market shifts or contextualize industry news, they’re not doing you a favor — they’re signaling to readers that your perspective is worth hearing. Outset PR has seen this effect consistently. A single well-placed expert quote could carry weight with investors, because it demonstrates understanding rather than promotion. How Outset PR’s Expertise Converts Coverage Into Confidence A media footprint is most powerful when it reinforces what you already claim about your product. Journalists look for narratives grounded in market reality — why your work matters now, where it fits, and what problem it actually solves. Outset PR encourages founders to treat earned press mentions as a structural element of their storytelling. The cases of Graphite Network and NOWPayments are strong illustrations of this effect. Outset PR shaped the narratives behind both projects in a way that highlighted what mattered: technical insight for Graphite and product clarity for NOWPayments. As a result, Forbes, VentureBeat, and other tier-1 outlets didn’t just mention them — they explained them. Investors responded to those explanations because they carried weight that internal messaging rarely achieves. When Forbes called NOWPayments “the ideal choice for digital transactions,” the phrasing became an asset the team could use across conversations. The Outcome: Confidence Built on Evidence In the crypto space, earned media creates the kind of familiarity and reassurance that investors treat as part of their due diligence. A few strong articles and commentary pieces can influence how people think about your project long after they’ve closed the tab. When founders treat their media presence as a tool they give investors clarity. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

In 2031, we expect the 0G price to achieve $180. The launch of the Aristotle Mainnet in September 2025 marked a major milestone for 0G, transitioning from testnet to full production and positioning itself as a leader in the AI-crypto space. With over 100 day-one partners—including Chainlink, Google Cloud, Binance Wallet, MetaMask, and Coinbase Wallet—0G entered the market with one of the strongest ecosystems in blockchain history. Its modular design has already showcased breakthrough performance, achieving 50 GB/s throughput and processing more than 650 million transactions on testnet. Real adoption is starting with HAiO’s AI-powered iNFT music agents, while institutional support grows through Flora Growth’s $401 million treasury commitment to 0G. Combined with listings on Binance, Bitget, and HTX, plus $325 million in funding from top-tier investors, 0G crypto shows strong fundamentals that could fuel significant growth. Based on these developments, many analysts see upside potential in the 0G token price prediction for 2025 as adoption and demand accelerate.

Is 0G a good investment? Deciding whether 0G tokens are a good bet comes down to what they bring to the fast-growing AI-crypto space. They stand out as the first “deAI OS,” tackling real problems like huge data and computing needs that other blockchains haven’t solved yet. With $360 million in backing from major investors and a proven testnet history, they’ve got both funding and credibility. Key advantages include strong scalability for growth, full on-chain transparency (better than centralized AI), and easy integration for developers who want to connect AI with Web3 apps. Since the AI market is expected to grow rapidly, 0G’s low-cost storage and compute could attract many builders and boost demand for the token. On top of that, community rewards and alignment nodes give extra reasons to hold it. Of course, crypto is always risky, but if you believe in AI’s role in blockchain, 0G looks like a solid option. Why is the 0G price down today? Over the last few hours, 0G price faced strong selling pressure from sellers. As a result, long-liquidation is creating a decline for 0G price. Will 0G price recover? If buyers hold the $1 level, we might see a strong recovery in the 0G price chart. Will 0G reach $100? 0G price might reach the $100 mark in 2029 if buying demand surges and 0G attracts altcoin investors with its strong AI adoption. Will 0G reach $1000? The $1000 mark is a distant dream for 0G token. This price level is achievable in the long run if 0G continues to expand its offerings and attract buying demand. Is 0G a good long-term investment? 0G token has gained popularity due to strong community support. However, conducting thorough research into their long-term potential is crucial to determine if they represent a viable long-term investment.

GeeFi’s Stable Foundation GeeFi offers a different approach by building a decentralized ecosystem focused on direct user empowerment and tangible value. It provides a non-custodial wallet , ensuring you have complete control over your assets, and creates clear opportunities for growth. One of its standout features is the upcoming staking program, which is projected to offer a substantial APR of up to 55% . This allows you to earn reliable passive income, providing a stable growth path that isn’t dependent on unpredictable market forces. GeeFi’s Presale Enters Phase 2 with Explosive Momentum The excitement around GeeFi is growing rapidly. The project sold all 10 million of its Phase 1 tokens, raising $500,000 in just 12 days . An incredible $320,000 of that was raised in the last week alone, showing a massive acceleration in demand. Now in Phase 2, the GEE token is priced at $0.06 , but the opportunity for huge returns remains. With a listing price of $0.40 already planned, investors who buy now are looking at a guaranteed return of 667% . Analysts are forecasting that GeeFi could become a $2 project. This means a $600 investment today could turn into $20,000 , delivering a remarkable 3,233% ROI . Given the rapid pace of Phase 1, experts predict Phase 3 could begin in just 3 weeks , so the window to get in at this price is closing fast. Your All-in-One Crypto Management Center GeeFi is developing a platform designed to simplify the entire crypto experience. The GeeFi HUB will act as a central dashboard, giving you a complete overview of all your digital assets. This HUB is designed to integrate with the GeeFi DEX , a decentralized exchange built for fast, secure, and low-cost trading across multiple blockchains.

It supports over 14 networks , allowing you to consolidate and manage all your crypto assets in one secure place. The GeeFi Team is also in discussions with several major exchanges about listing the GEE Token , a move that would bring more mainstream attention and liquidity to the project. GeeFi also rewards its community for its support. The referral program offers a 5% bonus in GEE tokens for every purchase made through your unique link. While Ripple’s price depends on institutional moves and market dynamics, GeeFi is building a future with real utility and sharing its success with its community from day one.

On the other hand, global markets saw disruptions from a CME trading outage and heightened security incidents, including an $11 million home invasion theft and an Upbit hack linked to Lazarus Group. Let’s dig deeper. Bitcoin Texas has formally become the first US state to initiate a direct Bitcoin purchase for its treasury, marking a significant step in state-level digital asset adoption. Crypto ATM operator Crypto Dispensers is considering a $100 million sale after both the company and its founder were charged in an alleged money-laundering scheme. An Ohio congressman has proposed the Bitcoin for America bill , which would allow Americans to pay their federal taxes in Bitcoin, with the proceeds then allocated to the United States’ planned Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Business CME Group temporarily suspended trading across its major derivatives markets after a cooling-system failure at a key CyrusOne data center disrupted its electronic infrastructure. Tether has emerged as the largest non-sovereign holder of gold, signaling a strategic pivot toward deeper commodity integration as global market volatility intensifies. Leaked documents indicate Brevan Howard’s Nova Digital fund secured a conditional right to reclaim its $25 million Berachain investment, though the project disputes any suggestion of preferential treatment. Web3 The long-standing rivalry between former UFC champions Conor McGregor and Khabib Nurmagomedov resurfaced this week following the launch of Nurmagomedov’s latest NFT project. BTCC, one of the world’s longest-operating cryptocurrency exchanges, has published its November 2025 Proof of Reserve (PoR) report, confirming a total reserve ratio of 146%, marking the seventh consecutive month of maintaining reserves significantly above industry norms. Security South Korean authorities are intensifying their investigation into the recent hack targeting Upbit, the country’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, as evidence increasingly suggests involvement by the North Korea-linked Lazarus Group. An armed intruder posing as a delivery worker stole approximately $11 million in cryptocurrency from the San Francisco residence of venture capitalist Lachy Groom, a tech investor previously in a relationship with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Regulation The UK government has released new guidelines requiring cryptocurrency exchanges to provide the British Tax Authority with complete customer information on their digital assets.

According to the analyst, these elements align technically and increase the probability of a substantial move for XRP. He supports the observation with chart images showing the relevant price action and the zone of compression. Components of the setup The analyst identifies three specific components that underpin his view. First, the alignment of the weekly and monthly closes at the same time is presented as a meaningful coincidence. Second, he points to a liquidity sweep — a sharp downward spike that cleared orders and was quickly reversed — followed by an equally quick recovery to the prior range. Third, the price then entered a period of tight compression within a clearly defined horizontal band, indicating reduced volatility and concentrated order flow. Together, these elements are described as a cohesive pattern rather than a collection of isolated events. That Sunday dual close for XRP — weekly + monthly — doesn’t happen by coincidence. The chart looks engineered: liquidity sweep, instant recovery, tight compression. This is the kind of setup that blows open overnight. $XRP pic.twitter.com/zNeVIAzkNe — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) November 29, 2025 Implications for price action Ripple Bull Winkle frames this configuration as a higher-probability setup for a decisive move, noting that the combination of a liquidity sweep and subsequent compression can leave the market primed for rapid expansion once a breakout occurs. He suggests that traders should treat the setup as actionable information: its features imply that a breakout will be significant. The path to that breakout was prepared by the preceding sweep and the alignment of longer-timeframe closes. The analyst does not provide direct price targets in the post; he only highlights the structure of the setups. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market reaction and sentiment A response from X user Guoyu RWA reinforced the notion that XRP’s recent structure was precise. He noted that the dual close and the overall sequence appeared almost pre-planned, with each phase aligning too clearly to ignore. His remark reflects a broader sentiment among market watchers that the timing of the sweep, the swift recovery, and the subsequent compression — all coinciding with both the weekly and monthly closes — is precise enough to get close attention from technical analysts. What traders should take away From the analyst’s perspective, the event should not be dismissed as routine volatility. The alignment of timeframes, the liquidity-clearing move, and the subsequent compression are presented as structurally significant. For technical traders , the post functions as a signal to monitor the identified band closely for a potential breakout and to consider risk parameters that account for the possibility of a swift directional move following the compression phase.

With a prize pool exceeding $1 million in total value in giveaways and bonuses, which will run until Monday, $TAP is on experts’ lists of the best altcoins to buy in November. Additionally, as an emerging project in its early stages, $TAP is considered the most promising crypto presale of 2025 due to its significant upside potential. A 100x rally after its market debut may be the start of its explosive rally. At the same time, its unique blend of DeFi and TradFi, along with its unique offering as the world’s first omni-bank, positions it as arguably the best crypto to buy now . Will the Cardano Price Dump Further? Every Cardano price pump these past few weeks has been sold—bears have been gobbling up each rally. Will it decline further, or is ADA among the most promising altcoins to buy at current levels? Trading sideways on lower timeframes, more concerning are the 33% and 47% downturns on its 30-day and 90-day charts, respectively. Also worth noting is the 53% decline year-to-date—holders are currently underwater. The Cardano price failing to bounce from current levels may result in a retest of $0.35. Thorson , a top analyst on X, predicts the Cardano price will break the 2022 lows if it fails to surpass its 2021 high during this cycle. $0.25, $0.15 and $0.10 cannot be ruled out, in their opinion. However, an overall crypto market rally may send ADA higher, making it nonetheless one of the top altcoins to buy , even if for modest gains. Why HYPE May Not be the Best Crypto to Buy Now The HYPE price has been ranging between $29 and $38 this week. Bulls are yet to push the altcoin above $40 on its 7-day chart, which is somewhat concerning, as it suggests declining confidence. However, bulls managing to send the altcoin price above $45 may result in a bigger uptrend. An overall market rally or sentiment tilting more towards bullishness may contribute to a substantial rally in the HYPE price . Nevertheless, considering a 10% downturn on its weekly chart, experts are largely pessimistic and traders aren’t throwing caution to the wind either. Eddie , a crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), predicts the HYPE price may retest $25. Moreover, given its $11 billion market cap, Hyperliquid may not be the best crypto to buy now due to its limited upside potential. Digitap: The Biggest Crypto Black Friday Ever With $1M in Giveaways & Bonuses Digitap is at the heart of the current market buzz following the launch of its Black Friday Event. This weekend is set to be the most eventful yet, featuring 96 hours of deals, surprises, and real value. With 96 exclusive offers available between Friday and Monday, exceeding $1 million in total value, experts have hailed $TAP as the best crypto presale . Unlike any other event in the crypto scene, each hourly offer is unique, featuring discounts, giveaways, token bundles, free credits, and products. However, these offers are only active for an hour; they are replaced with another. To avoid missing out on drops that could be life-changing, participants are advised to regularly check the widget for the latest updates. Given the massive buzz this Black Friday event is generating, the Digitap presale is in overdrive. The $TAP token price is currently at $0.0334 in its second presale stage and is expected to reach its listing price of $0.14 quickly—a 319% gain. Contributing to its appeal is Digitap’s novelty in the cross-border payments market. It offers instant, global transfers with near-zero fees, alongside enabling users to spend crypto like cash via a globally accepted Visa card. $1 MILLION in CASH, PRIZES, GIVEAWAYS. BLACK FRIDAY SALE IS LIVE NOW Digitap – Stealing the Spotlight From ADA & HYPE Investors aiming to position themselves for substantial returns have been overlooking the underwhelming HYPE and Cardano price actions for Digitap. This new DeFi-TradFi coin, dubbed the most profitable crypto presale of 2025, is tipped for a 100x rally after its launch.

The broader crypto market staged a gradual recovery after many assets plummeted to levels not seen in seven months. As expected, the recent sell-off affected the derivatives market. However, as the market is recovering, derivatives contracts are also stabilizing. The crypto exchange Bybit has published a report in collaboration with the data and analytics platform Block Scholes, revealing how well the derivatives market is improving. Gradual Recovery in Derivatives Market According to the report, BTC and ETH have bounced back to levels above $92,000 and $3,000, respectively. Their recovery comes alongside improved global risk appetite, investor sentiment, and positive macroeconomic signals. Although participation rates in derivatives have remained low since the October 10 liquidation event, BTC and ETH perpetual swaps have recorded several sessions of positive rates this week. While BTC and ETH perpetuals funding rates remained positive throughout the sell-off, altcoin rates underperformed. BTC and ETH have seen consistently positive rates over the last two weeks, but last weekend’s sell-off saw altcoin pairs pay extra for leveraged short exposure. Following that incident, open interest and volumes have remained relatively low across altcoin derivatives instruments. However, analysts found that short-term implied volatility levels indicate that traders have priced out their most extreme fears of further downside in the short term. “Short-tenor implied volatility levels no longer trade at such an extreme premium after the normalization of the term structure of volatility, and puts no longer hold as strong a premium above calls (despite not fully pricing out a preference for downside protection),” the report stated. Positive Macroeconomic Landscape The reaction in altcoin derivatives instruments last weekend suggested relatively high demand for short exposure to profit from further downside price movement. On the other hand, options saw a slight reduction in the skew towards puts. Large market cap altcoins that improved the most during this week’s slow-and-steady recovery include Solana (SOL), Toncoin (TON), Cardano (ADA), and Curve DAO (CRV). These assets recorded significant open interest in perpetual swaps. Meanwhile, the recovery in crypto assets has coincided with a positive trend in the macroeconomic landscape. The S&P 500 index recorded some upward movement, and the end of the U.S. government shutdown has cleared some of the fog clouding the Fed’s judgment ahead of the upcoming FOMC meeting. There is a high chance the next meeting will end with a 25 bps cut, possibly triggering a BTC rally.

In the process, the ongoing Phase 6 in the Mutuum Finance Presale has almost concluded, and the great interest in the token has evidenced itself in rapid momentum. There’s an in-house stablecoin and an innovative ‘buy and distribute’ system in the Mutuum Finance platform, and all these factors are setting the foundation for long-term value appreciation. But can MUTM hit the $10 price target in the next couple of years? Presale Momentum Approaches a Critical Point The Mutuum Finance presale represents an indicator in the market, reflecting the high adoption rate, advancing through the different stages. In Phase 6, over 95% has been sold, marking the last opportunity available to invest in MUTM tokens at $0.035. The presale has recorded $19,020,000, contributing from 18,250 investors. Phase 7 would see the approximate 20% price increase, pegging the cost at $0.040, in advance of the proposed $0.06 listing price on the exchange. Furthermore, the $100,000 giveawa y, in the form of handing out $10,000 in MUTM to each of the ten winning individuals, would encourage communal participation and serve the purpose of making MUTM an attractive crypto to invest in before the launch. Foundations for Exponential Growth Mutuum Finance is much more than just a presale, it’s an ecosystem that has the ability to provide and create value. There are two aspects in this ecosystem, and they are both immensely important in the long run when it comes to the price appreciation. The first thing the ecosystem would bring, and possibly the most important, would be the over-collateralization stablecoin, pegged at $1, and it would fuel the lending markets. The other important aspect would be the ‘buy and distribute’ system. This would create a great loop. A percentage of all the ecosystem’s fees would go into buying back the Mutuum Finance tokens and distributing them among the people who stake their ‘mtTokens.’ A $10 Target: Historical Context and Prospective Path Achievement of the $10 price point for MUTM in the first 24 months would be a great accomplishment, although such increments have happened in the crypto space. The best example would be the Ethereum network, abbreviated as ETH, in the 2020-2021 bull run. ETH was trading at approximately $120 in the lowest point in the crypto markets in March 2020, and in November 2021, it touched almost $4,800, showcasing a multiplier effect of 110x from the cycle lows. Mutuum Finance plans on developing a critical DeFi service through its lending framework and stablecoin. With the capturing of a decent market in the DeFi lending space and proper management, the utility, stake, and accumulation pressures could trigger a parabolic rise. In terms of investment for the next big crypto rally, the model grasps the underlying strength typically observed in the historical rallies of leading cryptocurrencies. The Final Consideration Before Launch The confluence of a rapidly closing presale schedule, an elegantly designed token economic model, and a well-articulated roadmap with ideas on growing the ecosystem provides an opportunistic moment in time. Mutuum Finance talks extensively about long-term value maximization and nothing much on short-term gains. Though $10 may be an ambitious benchmark, its underlying architecture and framework make perfect sense and fall in line with successful crypto-economic models.

His line — “Sell when there is maximum greed, and buy when there is maximum fear” — was posted as markets showed fresh signs of strain and debate over whether now is a buying moment or another stall. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Face A Harsh December: Rising BTC Difficulty, Falling Hashprice CZ’s Message Meets Extreme Fear According to the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, sentiment recently climbed to 20, moving out of “Extreme Fear” after a streak of low readings. The index had hit a yearly low of 10 on Nov. 22 and the market had spent eighteen days stuck in extreme fear. Unpopular opinion, but it’s better to sell when there is maximum greed, and buy when there is maximum fear. 🤷‍♂️ — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) November 29, 2025 Analysts called that stretch unusually deep. Matthew Hyland described it as the “most extreme fear level” of the cycle, and other traders argued that calling it extreme was being generous. Bitcoin Holds But Mood Is Fragile Based on reports, Bitcoin was trading at $91,780, a far cry from the all-time high of $126,000 reached in October. Prices remain up from 2024 lows of just over $40,000, yet confidence is thin. Santiment tracked online chatter and found talks focused more on volatility and institutional moves than on excitement. The Altcoin Season Index sat at 22/100, a clear sign that traders are favoring safety. Market Psychology Overrules Charts Traders reacted fast to CZ’s post. One user said emotion often beats logic in real trading. Another noted that markets tend to move on psychology well before technical signals line up. That gap between what traders know and what they do was on full display: many agree with the rule, and few actually follow it when prices slip. History Offers A Hint, Not A Guarantee Reports have disclosed that some analysts see a pattern. Nicola Duke pointed out that in the last five years, every time the market reached extreme fear, Bitcoin found a local bottom within weeks. While past stretches can offer context, they do not promise the same result now. Bitwise researcher André Dragosch warned that current pricing reflects a recession-level global growth outlook — the most bearish setting since 2020 and 2022 — which raises real risk for buyers. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s November Slump Could Trigger A 2026 Revival, Analysts Say Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Turns Positive After 29 Days Meanwhile, the Bitcoin (BTC) Coinbase premium finally flipped back into positive after nearly a month of staying in the red. Data from Coinglass on the 30th showed the premium at 0.0255%, marking the first positive reading in 29 days. For almost a month, the negative premium had suggested that selling pressure dominated the US market, with traders and investors leaning toward caution. The Coinbase premium tracks how Bitcoin’s price on Coinbase, a major US exchange, compares to the global average. When it’s positive, it means the US price is above the worldwide average. This is often seen as a sign that buying is picking up in the US, more institutions are getting involved, dollar liquidity is recovering, and overall investor confidence is improving.

Analyst Points To Big Banks And Private Equity Players,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-price-suppression-analyst-points-to-big-banks-and-private-equity-players/,"Reports are circulating that big financial players may be quietly buying XRP while the price sits near $2.18. If true, that could help explain why XRP hasn’t pushed past $3 even as trader interest grows. Some observers point to shrinking exchange wallets and limited disclosures as hints that accumulation is happening off-exchange. Are Institutions Buying? On-chain data shows Coinbase’s XRP stash fell sharply — from almost 1 billion tokens to about 32 million in September. Some analysts read that as coins being moved into private custody, possibly under NDAs. Market commentator Dr. Jim Willie has suggested banks like Bank of America and BNY Mellon could be building positions quietly . He’s also picked up on recent remarks from BlackRock’s Larry Fink about an XRP ETF and taken them as another sign of institutional involvement. That’s a possible explanation, not proof. Hydraulic Shift And ETF Bets Willie uses a “hydraulic” metaphor: money leaving Bitcoin and Ethereum could push large gains into XRP if flows shift that way. ETFs , he argues, could speed this process by giving institutions easier access — especially if over-the-counter supply tightens. But analysts warn against assuming ETFs will automatically spark a rapid price surge. Liquidity, market sentiment and broader macro conditions still matter a lot. Targets, Math And Past Rallies XRP recently traded under $2.20, roughly $2.18 as November closed. Commentator Meme Whale floated targets of $5 (near-term) and $10 (longer-term) — rises of close to 130% and 358% from current levels by April 2026. For perspective, XRP once jumped 340% in five weeks back in 2021, rising from $0.43 to $1.96. Past spikes show how volatile the crypto market can be, but they don’t guarantee a repeat. My Prediction For Next 5 Months: $BTC : $140K-$200K+ $ETH : $5K-$10K $BNB : $1500-$3000 $SOL : $300-$600 $XRP : $5-$10 $WKC : $0.00001-$0.0001 $FLOKI : $0.01-$0.1 $SHIB : $0.001-$0.01 $MANYU : $0.00001-$0.0001 $CREPE : $0.001-$0.01 $LUNC : $0.001-$0.01 $SUI : $6-$10 $PI : $5-$15 $DTG :… — 𝓜𝓮𝓶𝓮 𝓦𝓱𝓪𝓵𝓮 (@MeMeWhAle0) November 28, 2025 Big Claims Vs. Reality Willie has even suggested XRP could one day rival the US dollar in global trade, implying market caps as high as $100 trillion. Most experts call that extremely unlikely. Skeptics say those projections far outstrip reality and demand hard evidence before accepting ideas about coordinated price suppression or ultra-high future valuations. Institutional accumulation could be happening — it’s plausible — but there’s no airtight proof yet. Investors should weigh on-chain data and credible analysis against hype and bold forecasts. In short: interesting signs, but tread carefully.

FQ3 2025 results showed strong double-digit revenue and EPS growth, driven by rising derivatives activity, stablecoin revenue, and expanding institutional demand. Coinbase maintains a low-leverage balance sheet and premium margins, supporting potential multiple expansion and resilience in various rate environments. I reiterate a $385 price target (~45% upside), arguing that improving crypto sentiment and continued business momentum could fuel a rebound. Following my previous article on Coinbase ( COIN ), the cryptocurrency exchange experienced a significant 14% decline in stock price, mainly driven by crypto volatility, uncertainty about the Fed's monetary policy, and AI concerns clouding broader market sentiment. COIN: Stock Price Declined By Roughly 14% Since My Last Article (Seeking Alpha) My bullish thesis hasn't changed. Coinbase remains a market-leading company, presenting a low-leveraged capital structure, high double-digit revenue growth, and premium margins. Pro-crypto administration is fueling cryptocurrency and digital asset adoption with established frameworks such as the GENIUS Act , bringing more clarity to the stablecoin environment, and this remains a core tailwind for the company. The crypto seasonality hasn't played out yet, and I argue the sentiment may rebound from here. Coinbase is heavily dependent on the crypto space, and Bitcoin is experiencing the second-worst Q4 ever, reflecting a 20% drawdown at the time of writing, while it historically delivers a 77% return on average. The setup going into December appears compelling, and I think the crypto company appears well-positioned to rebound from these levels. I still rate Coinbase a Buy with a $385 price target over the next 12 months. This presents a 45% upside possibility and broader market outperformance. I believe COIN may appear to be a compelling opportunity for investors seeking crypto exposure through equity markets. FQ3 2025: A High Double-Digit Growth On October 30, the company delivered FQ3 2025 results. The cryptocurrency exchange posted a significant, high double-digit top and bottom-line growth quarter, reflecting solid market position, strong fundamentals, and excellent execution. The market reacted to the results with a nearly 5% upside over the following trading session. Coinbase posted $1.87 billion in revenue, a 55% growth on a year-over-year basis, and $60 million above what the market had anticipated. The bottom line arrived at $1.50 in diluted EPS, a 5x surge over the past year, versus $0.28 in the same quarter last year, and $0.40 above analysts' estimates. These results indicate robust and steady performance, which I think deserves a premium multiple. COIN: FQ3 2025 Key Highlights (Coinbase Investor Relations) In the shareholder letter , management highlighted that it is successfully scaling crypto operations, indicating $355 million in stablecoin revenue, representing a 7% growth on a quarter-over-quarter basis. In addition, the company heavily focuses on the derivatives area, launching 24/7 perpetual style derivative contracts. It has reached $840 billion in notional derivatives volume, a combined result with Coinbase and Deribit, reflecting an all-time high performance and significant demand for the product. Furthermore, the cryptocurrency company delivered $1.05 billion in transaction revenue, representing a 37% surge on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Subscription and services revenue reached $747 million, a 14% increase on a quarter-over-quarter basis. This suggests that COIN experiences a solid momentum in demand and operates well on all cylinders. If the company can sustain double-digit performance across different revenue streams, the market may continue pricing the stock at a higher premium. Coinbase achieved $295 billion in trading volume, $516 billion in assets on the platform, and $300 billion in assets under custody, representing a substantial moat, solid market position, and supporting a positive outlook. COIN: FQ3 2025 Revenue (Coinbase Investor Relations) The transaction revenue nearly doubled over the past 12 months from approximately $573 million to $1.05 billion. I want to emphasize that meaningful business expansion was achieved across all segments. The largest portion of revenue was derived from consumers, underscoring $844 million in top-line contribution, and a roughly 75% surge on a year-over-year basis. Nevertheless, the institutional client revenue rose the fastest, about 2.5x over the past year, highlighting $135 million in revenue versus $55 million in the same quarter last year. I think this is important because Coinbase is seen as a compelling application for all-in-one cryptocurrency transactions across both retail and institutional investors. A significant surge in top-line results underlines massive demand, and if Coinbase can sustain a dominant position in the market, I think it could tremendously benefit from the broader market growth trend. Stablecoin revenue remained the largest top-line contributor for subscription and services revenue. It has reached $355 million in FQ3 2025, a nearly 44% growth on a year-over-year basis. Moreover, the company achieved growth across all segments, too, supporting my thesis of excellent execution. JP Morgan research highlighted that the stablecoin market is valued at roughly $225 billion . It is anticipated to reach between $500 billion and $750 billion over the next following years. This would indicate a massive surge in stablecoin adoption, which would likely heavily contribute to the broader bullish sentiment for crypto and digital assets. I would also like to highlight that the US administration remains pro-crypto, and if more legislation is signed, creating a more favorable environment for the space, sentiment may dramatically shift, and that would have a positive effect on COIN. COIN: FQ3 2025 Operating Expenses (Coinbase Investor Relations) In the shareholder letter, management also noted that it managed to sustain transaction expense, equaling 14% of net revenue, versus 15% in the same quarter last year. I think this is compelling, indicating management pursues a shareholder-friendly, cost-focused approach. This also heavily contributes to the bottom-line expansion. Furthermore, in the letter, it is underlined that in October 2025, management increased an authorized share repurchase program to $2 billion. Although it didn't provide any additional information on whether it will be used anytime soon, it presents a shareholder-friendly capital allocation approach. I believe if Coin decides to buy back its shares, this could support bottom-line growth expectations. Coinbase is a low-leveraged business, with cash exceeding total obligations . This suggests that share buybacks may be a possibility in the future. COIN: FQ3 2025 Coinbase One (Coinbase Investor Relations) COIN continues its user-focused approach with its Coinbase One, an application offering a range of subscription packages fitting anyone's needs. Such flexibility aims for an elevated user experience and a sticky customer base. The consumers may benefit from all tiers with a fixed monthly fee, and that could also assist COIN in achieving a more steady top-line performance. Overall, I think this was a significant quarter for the company, implying a high double-digit top and bottom line growth. Based on the results, Coinbase is running well on all cylinders, and that fuels a bullish narrative over the following quarters. The cryptocurrency exchange experiences a surge in demand among both consumers and institutions, and with tailwinds tied to stablecoins and digital asset adoption, I argue the positive trend may continue further. Coinbase Isn't Cheap, But More Upside Ahead I kindly invite you to read my previous article on the company, which focuses on a more in-depth valuation analysis. Nevertheless, I would also like to highlight a few key things. The cryptocurrency exchange leader is trading at a 33x earnings multiple . One could argue this appears expensive, but the chart below suggests this reflects a typical business valuation over the past few years. COIN: Forward P/E (YCharts) The chart also highlights that if sentiment improves and Coinbase delivers better performance than anticipated, there is room for multiple expansions. The company traded at roughly 50x earnings multiple around the end of 2024 and mid-summer 2025. If the cryptocurrency space experiences the end-of-year rally, I think this earnings multiple may appear to be a reasonable target. It may be driven by optimistic sentiment and a risk-on environment. COIN: Capital Structure (Seeking Alpha) A low-leveraged capital structure presents an additional argument for a bullish continuation. The company has $7.78 billion in total obligations and $9.77 billion in cash; thus, it could pay its debt with ease. This also reflects that Coinbase appears to be well-positioned to operate in both high and low interest rate environments. Coinbase operates at premium margins, which I think remains a core tailwind for future profitability, bottom-line growth, and higher valuation. The gross profit margin (TTM) of 85% represents a 40% advantage versus peers at 61%. The net income margin (TTM) of 44% signals an 83% premium versus the sector median of 24%. COIN is a profitable business, operating at above-market margins, and this supports a bullish thesis. The markets are pricing in a roughly 85% likelihood of the interest rate cut in December. I think this indicates a dovish Fed's position, and if anticipation materializes, this could spark the end-of-the-year rally for risk assets. I kindly invite you to read my previous article, which presents more detailed information about the company's valuation. Nevertheless, COIN remains a significant, high-quality business with solid fundamentals. The stock price has been heavily suppressed due to uncertainty tied to the macroeconomic outlook and weak cryptocurrency sentiment. If investor confidence returns, I think Coinbase may appreciate in price, followed by a strong continuation of its business performance. Wall Street anticipates $7.06 in diluted EPS for FY2026, and $7.93 in diluted EPS for FY2027. If crypto sentiment rebounds and sustains throughout FY2026, I think the estimates appear conservative. Bitcoin may not replay a typical 4-year cycle, and with institutional adoption, the trend may shift to a less cyclical approach. However, I favor a conservative approach; therefore, if we apply a 49x earnings multiple to the FY2027 EPS estimate of $7.93, we arrive at my price target of $385. If sentiment rebounds, Coinbase is likely to continue solid growth in business performance, supported by its leading market position. This could elevate sentiment and bring valuation to the higher end of the trading range. My Bullish Thesis Remains Unchanged I think Coinbase remains a compelling opportunity for long-term investors seeking a market-leading company in the cryptocurrency landscape. The recent sell-off appears overdone, and with a shift in crypto sentiment, Coinbase may rebound from these levels. It remains a high-growth, high-demand company that focuses on an elevated user experience, operates at premium, above-market margins, and strengthens its market dominance through stablecoin adoption and an all-in-one application approach. The risks and concerns remain as indicated above and in my previously written article. Coinbase is heavily dependent on crypto seasonality, volatility, and sentiment, appears to be exposed to regulatory uncertainty, and monetary policy. Nevertheless, it has a low-leveraged capital structure and appears to be well-positioned to operate throughout different monetary environments. I think tailwinds outweigh the headwinds in the short term. My bullish thesis remains unchanged. I still think Coinbase is a Buy with a $385 price target over the next year. This presents a 45% upside possibility and broader market outperformance. 32 Wall Street analysts project a $384 price target, which is in line with my expectations. It will be interesting to see whether anticipation materializes.",COIN|COIN:CA|ZCOI:CA,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-11-30 18:03:38

His analysis presents a sequential process—each stage reinforcing the next—through which XRP could gradually assume roles traditionally reserved for fiat currencies and, ultimately, evolve into a globally recognized reserve asset. The path for XRP to become legal tender and eventually a global reserve currency is not fantasy. It is a sequence of logical, structural, and economic events that are already unfolding. Here is the case: 1. XRP becomes regulated settlement infrastructure Once banking charter… pic.twitter.com/cAINw44jmI — Stern Drew (@SternDrewCrypto) November 29, 2025 From Regulation to Settlement Infrastructure The first stage centers on regulatory transformation. As banking charter approvals , compliance frameworks, and ETF structures advance, XRP’s function could shift from speculation to regulated liquidity provision. When jurisdictions formally recognize XRP as a legitimate cross-border settlement rail , they establish the legal conditions necessary for its inclusion in institutional payment systems. This recognition marks the beginning of its transition from a market-traded token to a structural component of international finance. Government Adoption and Functional Legal Tender Drew suggests that governments facing economic strain—particularly those managing debt, inflation, or currency instability—will increasingly turn to faster, cheaper, and neutral payment rails. In such environments, XRP’s design offers an efficient settlement option for both domestic and cross-border transactions. Once a government employs XRP for internal or intergovernmental settlements, its usage inherently aligns with legal tender status for specific state functions. Synthetic CBDCs and Central Bank Integration Another critical stage involves the evolution of central bank digital currencies. Rather than building complex, proprietary CBDC systems, smaller nations may adopt synthetic models backed by their fiat reserves but issued and settled through the XRP Ledger. This approach positions XRP as the technical and liquidity foundation underpinning those systems. As central banks conduct interbank settlements or cross-border transfers in XRP, it attains de facto legal tender status within that operational framework. Adoption by Commodity Exporters and Market Precedent According to Drew, a major shift would occur once resource-exporting nations begin accepting settlement in neutral digital assets. By adopting a non-sovereign, rapid, and transparent instrument such as XRP, exporters can avoid dependence on politicized or volatile fiat currencies. A single major exporter integrating XRP into settlement flows could create a precedent that expands global usage and legitimacy. Institutional Infrastructure and Systemic Recognition Ripple’s enterprise offerings—including Ripple Prime, RLUSD , and on-chain liquidity programs—form the institutional architecture for widespread adoption. As banks, fintechs, and governments adopt these interoperable systems, XRP becomes embedded in global settlement infrastructure. Systemic reliance on this ecosystem leads naturally to legal and regulatory recognition, which in turn supports tender status.

A true reserve asset must be neutral, liquid, trusted, and settlement-ready—qualities Drew identifies as inherent to XRP’s structure. As sovereign wealth funds, multilateral organizations, and central banks begin holding XRP as a hedge or liquidity reserve, it evolves into a secondary reserve asset. Once global settlement volumes reach critical mass, holding XRP becomes a prerequisite for participation in international value transfer, effectively elevating it to a primary reserve role. Drew concludes that XRP’s trajectory does not depend on replacing the U.S. dollar or any sovereign currency. Rather, its potential lies in becoming the neutral infrastructure underpinning global financial interoperability—a role that, once achieved, naturally confers reserve status.

Despite the recent recovery, the broader trend remains tilted to the downside, and the daily chart suggests BTC is approaching a confluence area where the next major directional move will likely be determined. Bitcoin Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart Bitcoin remains inside a well-defined descending channel, with the price currently testing the mid-range of this structure. The recent rebound from the $80K–$83K demand zone marked the most aggressive buyback of the past month, but the move has stalled right at the lower boundary of the green supply block around $90K–$93K. The 100-day and 200-day moving averages continue to slope downward, sitting above the market and acting as dynamic resistance. As long as the price remains below these MAs, the macro trend leans bearish. The first major invalidation of bearish order flow would only occur with a clean reclaim of the $103K–$106K zone, which sits at the intersection of the larger golden supply region and the previous breakdown structure. For now, Bitcoin is struggling to break out of the descending trendline. Each advance into the $91K–$93K area has shown weakening momentum, suggesting that the market is not yet ready for a sustained breakout. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour chart, the asset has reached a critical resistance range, marked by the $92K bearish order block range and the multi-week descending trendline. If the current resistance holds, a return toward $86K–$88K becomes likely, and deeper liquidity still resides at the $80K–$83K macro demand zone, which remains the strongest support on the chart. Conversely, a daily close above the $93K level would open the path toward the $102K–$106K inefficiency zone, where the next major reaction is expected. The market is currently positioned at a critical decision point, and the next few weeks will determine whether this bounce evolves into a full retracement or fades into continuation of the broader downtrend. On-chain Analysis By Shayan While technical indicators highlight the $92K level as the immediate hurdle, on-chain data reveals a formidable “second layer” of resistance slightly higher up, driven by the average cost basis of specific market participants. The Realized Price by UTXO Age Bands metric is essential for identifying support and resistance, as the realized price of a specific cohort often acts as a psychological barrier. When the spot price trades below these levels, these holders are in a state of unrealized loss. Consequently, as prices rally back to their average cost basis, these investors often look to exit at breakeven, creating substantial sell-side pressure. Currently, the chart highlights a critical confluence of two distinct cohorts: The 1-week to 1-month cohort (Green line): representing recent “fomo” buyers or those who caught the falling knife. The 6-month to 12-month cohort (Orange line): representing medium-term holders who entered earlier in the year. The realized prices of both these cohorts have converged squarely in the $96K–$97K range. This confluence serves as a massive resistance block. Even if Bitcoin manages to clear the technical resistance at $92K, the rally is likely to face exhaustion near $96K–$97K as these significant cohorts look to mitigate losses and exit the market. The overlap of these two age bands amplifies the resistance, as it combines the panic of short-term traders with the capitulation of medium-term investors. A decisive close above $97K is required to signal that the market has absorbed this sell pressure and is ready for higher valuations.

The statement posted to X noted that the 1.75 million tokens went exclusively to team members as part of vesting schedules announced a year ago, reminding the community that Hyperliquid did not share any tokens to external investors, as the platform never raised venture capital. Hyperliquid: There are no investor unlocks The post included a Discord screenshot stating: “As announced a year ago, Hyperliquid Labs’ tokens unlocked on Nov 29, 2025. Different team members have different vesting schedules and can choose what to do with their vested tokens. Today, 1.75M tokens were distributed to different team members. We are thankful for each person’s contributions to the team and the broader ecosystem. For perspective, ~270M tokens were fully unlocked on Nov 29, 2024, in the largest airdrop in history, measured in today’s market value at ~$9.5B. There are no investor unlocks, as Hyperliquid never raised any external capital.” Why the clarification was needed Some analysts flagged the token movement, and it sparked speculation that external investors were preparing to sell. On-chain monitoring and analytics platform Lookonchain posted during the early hours of November 30 that the Hyperliquid team had been unstaking and restaking. It wrote, “The HyperLiquid team recently unstaked 2.6M $HYPE ($89.2M). Of that amount: 1,088,822 $HYPE($37.4M) was restaked; 900,869 $HYPE($30.9M) remains in the wallet; 609,108 $HYPE($20.9M) was sent to #Flowdesk; 1,200 $HYPE was sold for 41,193.45 $USDC.” However, the team only sold a fraction of HYPE, which has tipped the scales back toward optimism, as many observers speculated that the team was still very much bullish with its holding position. HYPE fell 4.6% following the unlocking news and has fallen by over 6% in the past 24 hours as of the time of writing. The token has declined by over 43% since its September all-time high of $59.40. The no-VC structure Hyperliquid distributed 31% of its one billion token supply to users during its November 2024 airdrop, with 23.8% allocated to the team under a one-year lockup. The remaining 38.888% is reserved for future emissions. The leadership says it hasn’t raised any funds, and the statement from its founders also shows that it’s quite sentimental. Co-founder Jeff Yan said in the past that the idea of raising funds from VCs seemed fake to him. Although the platform announced last month that it had filed with the SEC to raise up to $1 billion for HYPE token purchases and expansion. Get seen where it counts.

COIN's subscription and services segment, including USDC and Base L2, is reducing revenue cyclicality and supporting high margins, enhancing long-term attractiveness. The YieldMax COIN Option Income Strategy ETF (CONY) underperformed expectations during corrections, prompting a Sell rating, while direct COIN accumulation is favored after deep pullbacks. A tactical wheel strategy—using CONY after rallies and accumulating COIN at lows with hedges—balances risk and upside until sustained growth in stable segments emerges. In July, my approach to Coinbase Global ( COIN ) was bullish due to strong momentum. I had highlighted potential for continued record inflows into crypto ETFs and that (along with an environment of supportive legislations) supporting crypto prices. Bitcoin prices did not see the bull run I had expected, but this is not thesis-breaking yet. In crypto, corrections are often deep and rebounds sharper. In reviewing Coinbase even today, some of the factors supporting my Buy thesis in July still hold - strengthening of derivatives offerings and a USDC-based payments platform (revenue diversification beyond trading). However, I had recommended tactical use of the YieldMax COIN Option Income Strategy ETF ( CONY ) aware of valuation discomfort at the highs. The thought process there was that the option layer should deliver some delta in a correction scenario, plus de-risk capital faster. There are learnings there too, although the thesis turned around almost exactly for the use case it was designed for. Coinbase did correct by ~32% since my analysis and some fundamentals assumed needs a review. Expectations from CONY have also changed looking at the most recent behavior during corrections. The Thesis for Coinbase Reiterating the core Buy thesis for Coinbase, the retail trading fees is very cyclical and depends a lot on crypto price movements. The less cyclical stable base from subscriptions and services consists of USDC interest income, staking rewards, custody fees and blockchain infrastructure. The cyclicality in transaction revenues (heavily retail driven - over 80% of revenues) compared to the subscription and services segment is very visible in the revenue charts below Transaction and Subscription revenues ($m) - COIN (Seeking Alpha) Beyond trading, several emerging segments hold excellent unit economics potential. Stablecoin economics are very well supported with minimal crypto price dependencies. It generates interest income from T-bills (very predictable). Coinbase also earns 50% of USDC revenues. This makes the segment a very high margin segment. Margins potential is great in the custody segment too (SaaS-like business), where its dominant position and institutional interest ensures recurring revenues. Coinbase takes a cut of user staking rewards - a segment that should benefit from the recurring income stream with low operating costs. Base L2's sequencer revenue is extremely high-margin too and has the potential to become a billion dollar business of its own in a few years. Overall, the continued growth of the subscription and services revenues, particularly Base L2 and Stablecoins should help Coinbase reduce cyclicality of the topline and keep healthy margins intact. On the trading side, further strengthening of derivatives could help stabilize revenues as trading activity on derivatives can continue even in bear markets for crypto. How the Evolving Themes Have Done After a trough in Q2, Q3 trading volumes surged by 37% QoQ and this reflected in revenues, up by a similar range QoQ. Q3 bitcoin prices remained mostly stable, supporting the rebound around expectations from regulatory support through legislations like GENIUS and CLARITY. Therefore, it was very encouraging to note a rebound in volume versus Q2, where bitcoin prices actually rallied sharply. Data by YCharts Going ahead, Q4 volumes will be very important to see how Coinbase's transaction volumes do in reaction to bitcoin's sharp corrections so far in the quarter. This brings us to the important correlation of Coinbase's trading revenues with bitcoin prices. I believe, regulatory clarity is supportive and should lead to greater bitcoin adoption over time. Adoption, more than rally in prices, is key to transaction volumes. If Q4 volumes remain strong despite the bitcoin corrections, Coinbase investors will rerate the stock on the improving adoption versus price correlation. One indicator of importance, in my view, is bitcoin volatility. Adoption and lower volatility are a flywheel-like structure where one boosts the other. Low volatility is an offshoot of greater adoption, and greater adoption will emerge when bitcoin volatility starts showing equity or gold-like stability (or at least decrease from the current trends of 30% rally and corrections quite frequently). The last one year trends did show some reduced and stable volatility levels in Q3 (where volumes did exceedingly well). Volatility is inching up again, but over time as long as the highs are lower and the lows fall further, the bitcoin thesis will become stronger, helping Coinbase's thesis. Data by YCharts Another supporting factor for the trading volumes is the traction in derivatives. After the acquisition of Deribit (closed in August 2025), Coinbase processed over $840b in notional derivatives volume during Q3. In Q1, the volumes were closer to $800b, so the trend is already positive and helped by the Deribit acquisition. Deribit contributed about $52m in revenue only, but has been in play for less than half of Q3. Assuming this number crosses $100m in Q4, it should account for almost ~10% of transaction revenues (~$1b). Depending on how fast Coinbase can scale derivatives in retail, the upside from the derivative focus is both stabilizing and accretive. Of course, margins on volumes are not very high, so large volume traction over the $840b in Q3 will be required, which may take time (international expansion are also subject to regulatory hurdles). On the more stable subscription and services side, the outlook of the stablecoins revenue growth also remains strong. Growing trends continued in Q3 with a YoY increase in revenue by ~44%. Its Layer2 network, Base, turned profitable and benefited from more transactions and higher ethereum prices. Coinbase still remains heavily dependent on its trading revenue fluctuations, but the growth prospects in a stable subscription and services segment appear encouraging. Numbers and Valuations The gross margins remain strong and often shrink when trading volume dictates the revenue mix because of lower margin potential over the higher margin and more stable subscription/services business. But looking at the overall mix of factors - growth in overall trading volumes, still strong gross margins of ~80% despite the trading contribution and a growing crypto-price agnostic portfolio - I feel Coinbase's results were reasonably positive. Data by YCharts There is some drag expected in the subscription and services revenue expected in Q4 (with guidance pointing to a midpoint revenue expectation of ~$750m, almost flat compared to Q3). USDC market capitalization and Coinbase One subscriber growth should continue to grow to offset the rate cut impacts. Coinbase's diversified business is still dependent on progress in the stable segments and growth in derivatives. Rate cuts are a drag and rallies in bitcoin could be supportive. However, I view Coinbase from a long-term lens because short term fluctuations are high. From that perspective, I see rate cuts as the only systematic drag on its bull thesis. But there are compensating stories around stablecoins, L2 and less crypto-price dependencies that are equally impactful on its investment attractiveness. The EV to forward EBITDA is now at ~22x, down considerably from the highs of July (over ~30x). There is room for further contraction, looking at the rate cut pressures and historical valuation norms. But given its diversified positioning and rally potential on a crypto price rebound, it is difficult to call a bottom on valuations. So, based on its long-term thesis around L2, stablecoins and lesser dependencies on crypto prices, plus a overall better adoption expectations in the bitcoin space due to regulatory support, I think now is definitely a time to start accumulating Coinbase. Data by YCharts The July Strategy and CONY Corrections in Coinbase are part of the ride. In the past year alone, there have been 2 other such corrections above 30% (first from December 2024 to April 2025 by 50-60%) and another from July 2025 to August 2025, before the current drop starting October 2025). Each time Coinbase has bounced back. For a longer term investor riding a volatile stock, there is no room to be defensive. However, a smarter way to play Coinbase is to accumulate at the lows with put positions to hedge against further fall (and lap up more on such further corrections). At the highs (like in July), switching to a more conservative strategy like the YieldMax COIN Option Income Strategy ETF ( CONY ) makes more sense. I had recommended CONY over Coinbase in July expecting two things to play out. One, CONY's total returns saves around 2-5 percentage points from a deep crash in Coinbase (due to option premium income). Two, it de-risks investors faster at the highs - using CONY's high yields. The first expectation has not at all played out well. CONY has not only been able to generate the alpha in this fall from July, but has actually lagged even Coinbase despite an option income layer. This is also one of the core reasons why I have rerated CONY to a Sell (was anyway a Hold because of its performance flaws). Even COIW is a better bet if investors have a long-term bullish view on Coinbase, although it has tougher drawdowns. Data by YCharts The second expectation of de-risking investors from Coinbase has worked out favorably though. A $100 investment in Coinbase at the highs in July would have become ~$68 today. Investors who took the recommended CONY route in July would have lost $52 in CONY from the share price corrections. But they would have accumulated ~$30 in dividends as CONY continued to pay out aggressively even as Coinbase kept correcting. The net loss for CONY investors is therefore only ~$22, with a cash of ~$30 available (if set aside) for deployment at today's Coinbase lows. This compares favorably to Coinbase investors in July who would have otherwise lost ~$32. Data by YCharts This wheel-like strategy uses CONY very tactically and exactly for its aggressive yields (something that doesn't hold true for investors looking at CONY as an income generating vehicle). My overall strategy will remain overweighting CONY after huge rallies and accumulating Coinbase (with put hedges) after deep corrections. CONY enables upside capture to some extent if Coinbase rallies further from what I feel is a High, and protects downsides slightly better. When Coinbase corrects, accumulating the stock directly (using cash from the CONY payouts) with hedges ensures protection on further falls, while the upside can be fully captured. This may look like a trading strategy, particularly when I am bullish on Coinbase in the long term. It may look set up to fail when Coinbase eventually breaks out at some point. But if we keep looking at valuations rather than just prices and define the high low boundaries between ~20x and ~30x in terms of EV to EBITDA, it should work out well. There is no denying the core long-term growth prospects, but switching away from a wheel-like strategy (while still open to the benefits of an upside rally, though partially) should be triggered by several developments that enables long-term direct positioning in Coinbase. One development I am already tracking is the growth of the subscription/services revenue and any systematic explosion signals in L2 or stablecoins. Another important check will be trading volumes in Q4 and how its reacts to a fall in bitcoin prices - that should indicate whether more investors are looking at crypto as longer term investments and whether derivatives are making trading revenues more cycle-agnostic. I will also look for volatility reduction and further adoption of crypto for investments as well as transactions (wallets/payments). These appear on track as of today, hence a Buy rating for Coinbase at these levels. But to switch away from my CONY-to-COIN-to-CONY strategy, I will look out for further systematic progress.",CONY|COIN|COIN:CA,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-11-30 18:21:13

Top Crypto Investors Rush Into MUTM Ahead of the $0.06 Launch Price,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/the-next-big-altcoin-under-0-04-top-crypto-investors-rush-into-mutm-ahead-of-the-0-06-launch-price/,"Investors seeking the best crypto to invest in currently are looking at a rapidly expanding altcoin that only costs them less than $0.04. As the hype and its initial launch price are already established at $0.06, the hype surrounding Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining speed. According to many commentators, the project is in the same early phase that propelled several of the most popular cryptocurrencies to massive growth in the past and those who are early adopters in this project are moving quickly lest they see an additional price surge. Dual Lending Models, Yield Structure and Presale Growth Mutuum Finance is establishing a decentralized lending interface based on both Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer. Under the Peer-to-Contract, a user sends out the assets and gets mtTokens which become valuable as interest is being repaid by the borrowers. This generates actual APY by actual demand. The Peer-to-peer model allows borrowers to gain access to liquidity that is based on flexible interest rates. When predictable repayment factors are of more importance, users may borrow the loan based on variable rates based on the usage or stable rates based on the predictability issues. LTV limits contain positions. Higher LTV around 75% is generally backed by stable assets and lower LTV is backed by volatile assets within the range of 40%. Should the value drop to an extent that collateral is no longer able to pay off the loan, automated liquidations safeguard the system by providing the liquidators with discounted collateral. Mutuum Finance opened its doors at $0.01 in early 2025 and has since risen to $0.035, which is an increment of 250%. The project has brought in 18,200 holders and raised $19M. The 4B amount supply will include 1.82B tokens in the offering, and more than 800M tokens have been already bought. Phase 6 is entering the final stages, and momentum is set to increase accordingly. Security Strength and V1 Launch Timeline Mutuum Finance validated on its official X account that V1 is going to be launched on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. The liquidity pool, the mtToken system, the debt-tracking token and the liquidation bot will be all included in this version and supported at the inception with ETH and USDT. This premature release provides a large edge to Mutuum Finance when compared to most of the other upcoming altcoins entering exchanges without any working utilities. Security has also featured in a big way. A CertiK audit of the project had a 90/100 Token Scan score, and Halborn Security is currently reviewing the finalized lending and borrowing contracts. These measures provide analysts with assurance that Mutuum Finance is making good preparations to enter the DeFi sector well. Due to such strengths, a number of analysts predict that MUTM could proceed to the range of $0.25 to $0.40 after reaching its launch price of $0.06. According to early investor sentiment, this may turn out to be one of the strongest first phases of a new altcoin presence in the market in 2026. Oracle Safety and Second Price Projection Mutuum Finance is developing many primary utilities, including the mtToken system. Users are promised to get valuable assets when they provide them, and the value of the asset is enhanced throughout the borrower’s interest. It makes platform activity yield and induces long-term usage. The other significant trigger is the buy-and-distribute model. Some of the protocol revenue purchases MUTM in the open market. Open market MUTM is repurchased to users who stake the mtTokens in the safety module. This generates sustainable purchase force and prices appreciate as the platform increases. Chainlink oracles and fallback oracles and on-chain price data will also be used by Mutuum Finance to ensure that liquidation conditions are continuously updated. Dependable oracles play a significant role in the safety of lending and provide a better base to the protocol. And having this, it is the opinion of several analysts that MUTM may be in the $0.40 to $0.60 range as more people use the platform. This forecast is based on the belief that, as long as users remain on the rise, Mutuum Finance might emerge as one of the leading cryptocurrencies under the DeFi classification. Why Analysts See MUTM as a Comparison to Early Solana Other observers equate the state of Mutuum Finance to the early days of Solana. Solana was also able to move fast as it was early implementing a functioning technology and has built a solid following as well as created a desire among investors coming in quickly. Mutuum Finance is on the same route. It is developing a full lending protocol containing yield rules, constant collateral guidelines, robust oracle framework and long term income strategies. The simultaneous active growth and interest shown by early investors is why some people think that MUTM can experience early traction as closely comparable altcoins such as Solana have. The focus on the potential most profitable cryptocurrency to invest in when the Phases 6 go to full allocation is increasing, as the demand surge continues. The supply is also very small so that with a supply as little as below $0.04 the opportunity to enter is narrowing quickly.

More information has come out since then, with most of the blame being focused on an unnamed market maker, as the project’s founder, Sean Ren, put forward a statement containing updates on X. According to the post, the team has reviewed and confirmed that all token smart contracts and core infrastructures have been secure, with no signs of exploits or breaches. How the Sahara AI team is dealing with the price crash The post also reassured readers that the price drop was not caused by token unlock or selling. “Our TGE happened in June 2025. Unlock of core contributors & early backer tokens will not happen until a year later (June 2026), as per the unlock schedule: saharaai.com/blog/sahara-to…,” Ren wrote on X. He claims Sahara’s fundamentals remain unchanged, which means that all operations, product development, and strategic priorities will continue as planned with the aim of creating an agentic AI economy with fair value flow. As for what it has planned for next year, Sahara says it will continue to strengthen its AI infrastructure for professional services while expanding its business in data labeling and domain-specific agents. It will also focus on developing agentic protocols to power next-generation agent-to-agent interaction and revenue sharing and deploy “killer” crypto x AI applications to remove frictions in crypto UX. What happened to the $SAHARA token? Since Sahara AI’s $SAHARA launched earlier this year on major exchanges, the token has seen its own fair share of ups and downs. However, this recent drop is its most serious in some time. According to CoinGecko data, the token fell from an intraday high of $0.081 to a low of $0.0346. At the time of this publication, the price was hovering in the $0.043 to 0.044 range, down 42-45% in the last 24 hours, with a market cap of $107-108 million and 24-hour trading volume exceeding $378 million. According to Crypto Fearless, the sharp drop happened amid the unwind of a large, active market maker‘s book and signaled a liquidity stress event as risk controls were triggered and positions liquidated, amplifying selling pressure on the token. The market maker reportedly had exposure to several notable tokens, including MMT and SAHARA. After the exchange flagged what it called unusual market making in one project, linked addresses were identified and restricted. The firm’s positions were also liquidated in respect to the exchange’s risk governance framework, and analysts claim this greatly contributed to the post‑event price move. The incident has shown that while strengthened oversight and disciplined risk controls can mitigate cascading moves, traders still need to remain mindful of counterparty risk and token liquidity in volatile conditions.

This range is considered critical for interpreting institutional trends because it often represents funds, companies, and professional investors. According to Wedson, a halt in accumulation by these wallets is a signal to watch closely for the future of the market. Wedson notes that this behavior is similar to the 2021 cycle. During that period, the annual accumulation curve for addresses of the same size turned downward, and within a few months, Bitcoin's price began to weaken, transitioning into a bear market. The current pause is believed to indicate that institutional investors are once again adopting a cautious stance. Related News: A Country Announces a $300 Million Cryptocurrency Investment Directly from Its Foreign Exchange Reserves According to the analyst, this situation doesn't directly signal a sell signal or automatically signal the start of a bear market. However, the fact that large whales have stopped accumulating aggressively is a significant warning sign regarding liquidity and demand dynamics. The decline in institutional interest in the market suggests that price movements may weaken in the medium term. *This is not investment advice.

Now three chart watchers say the rotation is only delayed, arguing that easing quantitative tightening and a fresh drop in Bitcoin dominance could reopen the door for an altseason as soon as December. Analyst Links Altcoin Slump to Liquidity Squeeze, Not Failed Cycle Altcoin traders are asking if the market’s high-beta tokens are finished after the brutal drawdown that followed 2021. Yet, according to analyst account CryptosRus, the missing “altseason” looks delayed rather than cancelled, mainly because global liquidity has not supported a full rotation away from Bitcoin. In a post on X, CryptosRus said many traders expected a repeat of the explosive rallies seen in 2017 and 2021. Instead, Bitcoin dominance stayed elevated while most smaller coins lagged or slid to new lows. The analyst argued that this pattern reflects macro conditions rather than a structural collapse in altcoins themselves. Altseason Rotation Setup. Source: Merlijnthetrader Quantitative tightening across major central banks and a pullback in balance-sheet liquidity have limited the flow of capital into riskier corners of the crypto market, the post said. With less excess money in the system, investors focused on Bitcoin and a few large names instead of rotating into small-cap tokens. As a result, the altseason many expected “never fully ignited,” even as Bitcoin set fresh highs. Now, the liquidity backdrop may shift again. The analyst noted that quantitative tightening could end as early as next month, while markets also price in another interest-rate cut in December. If central banks stop draining liquidity and begin easing, crypto funds and speculative traders could gain more room to move down the risk curve. In prior cycles, that kind of shift has preceded rapid rotations from Bitcoin into altcoins. During this phase, retail investors often capitulate and sell at depressed levels. At the same time, large holders can use thin liquidity to accumulate positions quietly, the post suggested. A chart from trader MerlijnTheTrader, shared alongside the commentary, compares previous peaks in Bitcoin dominance and lows in the ETH/BTC pair to earlier altseasons and highlights a similar setup forming today. Macro Pressure Defers Alt Rotation, Chart Highlights Cycle Comparison Meanwhile , Pepe Whale’s post on X claims the 2025 altcycle mirrors past Bitcoin dominance corrections that came before broad altcoin rallies. The image compares 2017 and 2021 “final shakeout” phases, showing sharp declines in dominance toward rising diagonal supports, followed by fast rebounds. Then, trends continued along long-term diagonal baselines marked with upward arrows. Bitcoin–Altcoins Altseason Path. Source: 0xChiefy The lower left label ETH/BTC signals Ethereum’s relative performance versus Bitcoin is a rotation gauge in the cycle comparison. Meanwhile, the 2025 projection box sits near a similar diagonal support slope, marked by a “final shakeout” tag, suggesting analysts see a comparable dominance structure forming. Pepe Whale adds that Bitcoin momentum is a key catalyst for any alt rotation. At the same time, the post argues select low-cap tokens and memecoins could outperform if rotation follows historical patterns. The commentary highlights Pepe as a potential leader in the memecoin segment, tying the 2025 narrative to liquidity timing and dominance behavior. Analyst Says Bitcoin Dominance Pullback Could Open December Altcoin Window Bitcoin’s share of the crypto market has started to slip after a months-long climb, and one analyst argues that shift could set the stage for an altcoin rebound in December. In a post on X, trader Alex Clay said “altseason is not cancelled, it’s just delayed,” pointing to the latest downturn in Bitcoin dominance as a potential trigger for rotation into smaller tokens. Bitcoin Dominance Altseason Signal. Source: Alex Clay During most of 2025, Bitcoin dominance trended higher as capital favored the largest asset over riskier coins. However, that advance faded in November, with dominance easing back toward the high-50 percent band. Clay links that pullback to a pattern seen in previous cycles, where Bitcoin first captured liquidity and then ceded ground as investors moved down the risk curve. Now, Clay argues that if the current decline in dominance continues into December, altcoins could gain market share again. He frames the coming month as a test of whether macro conditions and risk appetite are strong enough to support a broad move away from Bitcoin and toward high-beta names, including lower-cap tokens.",News|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-30 18:57:56

Bitcoin and Ethereum have climbed back above key psychological levels, bringing renewed optimism to a sector that experienced significant turbulence just days ago. A comprehensive analysis by crypto exchange Bybit, conducted in collaboration with data platform Block Scholes, reveals that derivatives contracts are regaining stability. The report highlights how both spot and derivatives markets are responding to improved conditions across multiple fronts. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $91,362, suggesting a 1.18% increase in the last 24 hours and a 5.1% gain in the past week. BTC price chart, Source: CoinMarketCap This rebound reflects broader improvements in global risk appetite and more favorable macroeconomic signals. The recovery marks a significant shift from the previous week, when many crypto assets fell to their lowest levels in seven months. Ethereum has surged 1.97% in the last 24 hours to trade at around $3,033 at press time. ETH price chart, Source: CoinMarketCap Funding Rates Signal Market Sentiment Shift Perpetual swap funding rates provide crucial insight into market positioning. Bitcoin and Ethereum perpetuals have recorded multiple sessions of positive funding rates this week. This indicates long positions are paying short positions, suggesting bullish sentiment among leveraged traders. Throughout the recent sell-off, BTC and ETH maintained relatively positive funding rates. However, altcoins experienced different dynamics. Last weekend's market turbulence forced altcoin pairs to pay elevated premiums for leveraged short exposure. The data shows altcoin derivatives have underperformed compared to their larger counterparts. Open interest and trading volumes across altcoin derivatives instruments remain subdued. Yet the worst fears appear to be subsiding. Short-term implied volatility metrics suggest traders have moved past extreme downside expectations. The term structure of volatility has normalized considerably. Put options no longer command the significant premium over calls that characterized peak fear levels. While traders maintain some preference for downside protection, the pricing reflects measured caution rather than panic. Altcoin Performance Varies During Recovery The derivatives market for altcoins displayed heightened demand for short exposure during last weekend's price action. Traders positioned themselves to profit from anticipated further declines. Options markets showed a modest reduction in put-call skew, indicating slightly less bearish positioning. Several large-cap altcoins have emerged as leaders in the gradual recovery. Solana has demonstrated notable strength, attracting significant attention from derivatives traders. Toncoin, Cardano, and Curve DAO have also posted solid gains during the week's measured advance.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-30 18:59:57

Phase 2 is underway at a 20% higher price , projected to sell out in days , followed by Phase 3 with another 20% jump . The growing excitement is further fueled by rumors of major exchange listings and the upcoming release of new wallet features. Cutting Through the Crypto Noise Solana’s high-speed network and growing institutional interest make it a major player in the crypto space. Its technical upgrades and ETF products are designed to attract large-scale investment and enterprise users. However, this focus on high-level infrastructure and finance often overlooks the needs of the average person, who still finds the world of digital assets fragmented and difficult to manage. GeeFi addresses these market challenges by providing a non-custodial ecosystem that puts you in complete control of your assets. Instead of being subject to the whims of network debates or market-wide consolidation, GeeFi offers a clear path to growth through its utility-driven platform. Having already raised $500,000 and sold over 10 million tokens to close its first presale phase in a record 12 days, GeeFi has proven its ability to attract investors who are looking for a project with tangible results and a strong community foundation. The Presale Opportunity Capturing Attention The biggest wins in crypto are secured by those who identify potential before it hits the mainstream. The GeeFi presale offers precisely this type of ground-floor opportunity. After a phenomenally successful Phase 1, the project has now entered Phase 2, with the GEE token priced at just $0.06 . This gives new investors a guaranteed return of 667% based on the planned listing price. With analysts forecasting GEE to become the next $2 project , an investment today could deliver a remarkable 4,900% ROI , turning $1,200 into $60,000 . The momentum is so strong that analysts predict Phase 3 could launch in just three weeks. Building a Full Financial Ecosystem GeeFi is creating more than just a wallet. The upcoming GeeFi HUB will be a web dashboard that provides a complete overview of your crypto portfolio. This hub will also integrate the GeeFi DEX for simple token swaps and provide easy on/off-ramp services to convert between crypto and fiat currency. This commitment to practical utility is why many are confident in its long-term potential. The GEE token powers the entire ecosystem. Staking GEE offers up to 55% APR with a 12-month lock-in, encouraging long-term holding. Token holders will also receive benefits for the forthcoming GeeFi Crypto Card , including better rewards and lower fees. To further boost mainstream attention, the GeeFi team is in discussions about listing on major exchanges. With a referral program that pays you 5% of every payment made through your unique link, GeeFi provides multiple ways to benefit from its growth, making it a compelling choice for those seeking the next big opportunity in crypto.

The company is building a crypto treasury, holding significant Ethereum and Bitcoin assets, and aims to own 5% of outstanding Ethereum tokens. The stock is down over 50% from the October highs while developing a business around staking rewards to acquire more tokens in the future. The stock is appealing here on the sell off toward NAV with the opportunity for upside via higher ETH prices and corporate moves to acquire more tokens. BitMine Immersion Technologies ( BMNR ) has crashed the last couple of months with the rotation out of crypto. The No. 2 crypto treasury concept is focused on Ethereum and hasn't seen the same collapse in the underlying assets. My investment thesis is ultra Bullish on the crypto treasury concept after the complete reset of the stock. Source: Finviz Great Test BitMine Immersion has seen explosive growth in the last few months since going public. The recent sell off in the stock and the owned-crypto assets will provide a great indication of whether the crypto treasury concepts are fundamentally supported. The company listed the following crypto assets in the market update on Nov. 23: Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) - 3,629,701 tokens Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) - 192 tokens Eightco ( ORBS ) - 13.7 million units Cash - $800 million At the time, BitMine Immersion listed a total investment holdings of $11.2 billion. The key Ethereum price had already dipped from the $3,120 price used for the weekly update on Nov. 17 with the current calculation based on a price of $2,840. Source: TradingView The stock jumped with BitMine Immersion buying another 69,822 ETH tokens during the week. Strategy ( MSTR ) had been under pressure over the last week due to the leading crypto treasury facing pressure from the slumping Bitcoin price and concerns over debt, which is a risk BitMine Immersion doesn't face having focused solely on selling shares. Naturally, the BitMine Immersion focus is 99.9% on investing in Ethereum tokens and establishing a crypto treasury with 5% of the outstanding digital coins. BitMine now owns 3.63 million tokens for ~3% of the outstanding tokens. Source: BitMine Immersion presentation The biggest issue with BitMine Immersion is deriving the total shares outstanding at any particular point in time. According to the 10-K , the diluted share count was 384 million shares as of Nov. 20. Dip Opportunity The stock slipped to only $26 to end last week, placing the market cap at just $10 billion with a similar asset value of close to $10 billion. The stock had fallen far more than 50% from the early October peak while Ethereum is only down about 40% during this period from a peak of ~$4,700 in early October before the major liquidity event. According to DefiLlama, Ethereum dominates the TVL (total value locked) usage via cryptos. The digital coin handles 68% of the market, followed by Solana at nearly 9% and Bitcoin down at only 6.5%. Source: DefiLlama Ethereum has more real world value due to the blockchain of choice for stablecoins. BitMine Chairman Tom Lee continues to promote a value potential for the crypto of $62,500 based on the ""payment rails"" benefit in the future, pushing Ethereum up to a ratio of 0.25x the price of Bitcoin. The ETH/BTC ratio has traded down toward the historical lows at 0.33x. The normal ratio is 0.0479x BTC with a peak in 2021 at 0.873x. ETH would hit $12K and $22K, respectively, on reclaiming these ratios with BTC with the assumption that BTC trades up to $250K per token. Bitcoin currently trades below $90K, so the price targets could require major adjustments without a crypto bounce. The BitMine Immersion play is that crypto will continue to rise and that Ethereum will outperform Bitcoin due to the utility of the digital coin and the connection to future payments due to the stablecoin connection. Also, BitMine expects to use a 5% treasury holding position to generate staking revenues via the Made-in-America Validator Network (MAVAN) to further produce income to buy more Ethereum. The company declared a minimal annual dividend of $0.01. The dividend payout is minimal with a payout of below $4 million, but management likely tried to signal confidence in the balance sheet with $800 million in current cash. The stock is interesting here for anyone believing in the Ethereum story and the crypto treasury concept. BitMine Immersion has the potential to generate future income from staking and the utility from ETH could lead to higher crypto prices with the company buying more tokens from potentially selling more stock in the future at a premium to NAV. Naturally, the biggest risk is lower crypto prices. BitMine Immersion doesn't face any major corporate risk having not utilized debt or preferred securities with payout requirements. Not to mention, the company has the ability to unload Bitcoin and the ORBS shares without unloading the more important ETH tokens. Regardless, a lot of the benefits of the treasury concept could be lost without capital to purchase even lower Ethereum. Takeaway The key investor takeaway is that BitMine Immersion has been hit by slumping crypto prices, especially the key Ethereum price. An investor can now get into the stock at a much lower price and closer to NAV and hopefully ride the digital currency back to prior highs and potentially much higher. So far, the company has survived a major test handling the dip by purchasing more crypto and issuing a dividend.",BMNR,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-11-30 19:00:00

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/market-strategist-says-rip-xrp-heres-why/,"XRP currently trades near $2.2 after a steady climb that followed a quiet stretch in the market. Traders are watching the asset closely as momentum builds on the daily chart. The setup creates interest because the current structure resembles a historic moment for the token. Steph Is Crypto, a well-known analyst on X, recently released a video that focused on a specific chart pattern. He highlighted an imminent death cross between the 100-day and 200-day moving averages on XRP’s daily time frame. He said this same pattern appeared in 2017 at the bottom of the bear market. While this pattern would normally be bearish, Steph believes XRP is in a different position. RIP #XRP pic.twitter.com/xrnDoMgbId — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) November 29, 2025 What Does XRP’s Death Cross Mean? Steph pointed out that the last time this pattern formed in 2017, XRP rallied more than 10x in less than a month. He described the current setup as nearly identical in structure. He suggested that the cross looks close and that traders pay attention to the pressure that forms around it. XRP sits in a stronger market today, yet traders still pay close attention to this pattern. The asset’s position near $2.2 creates a clear reference point. A 10x expansion from this level sets a potential target near $22 if the asset repeats this historical performance . Steph Is Crypto did not promise any outcome, but he cited the previous reaction as a useful comparison for traders. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Is XRP Going to $22? XRP maintains active liquidity across major exchanges. Buyers continue to enter the market as trend forms tighter ranges. Market data shows strong interest around the $2 level as traders form new positions. Recently launched XRP ETFs also back this bullish sentiment. XRP now approaches a moment where trend indicators may flip. That shift could set the next phase of movement for the token. Traders prepare for volatility once the moving averages meet. Some expect a pullback, while others expect strength. Steph Is Crypto noted that the 2017 cross produced a sharp rally. The pattern looks identical to today’s chart. Notably, another well-respected analyst has pointed to a similar death cross as a bullish signal for XRP.

In that shift, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce said 2025 is the year financial policy turns the page. SEC Stance Shift 2025 Peirce described a clear pivot at the agency. She said the SEC is building durable rules for token issuance and exchanges. She stressed that a formal framework is overdue and that clarity now supports institutions that already want to take part. Peirce also explained that the market lived too long under case-driven enforcement. She pointed to the new Crypto Task Force work as the internal path to drafting a stable rulebook. She expects the shift to replace uneven enforcement with predictable standards. At the same time, she said these rules will focus on what is genuinely a security. The plan signals narrower SEC reach over spot tokens. That change could define how new issuance works for years. Jurisdiction Split CFTC vs SEC Peirce talked about dividing oversight between agencies. In her view, the spot token market better fits the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Meanwhile, the SEC keeps authority over crypto assets that meet real securities tests. She explained that two regulators reviewing the same products created friction. She added that splitting oversight reduces duplicated investigations and cost. The line now centers on asset nature rather than labeling all tokens the same way. Next, she raised capital formation. She said a registration-or-exemption path for token fundraising can reopen compliant ICO-style issuance. This step ties token issuance to existing U.S. capital-formation lanes, not side doors. Because of that, future token issuance may lean on standard exemptions, disclosures, or filings. That alignment is meant to move new issuance from informal launches to filed issuance. Self-Custody And Financial Privacy Peirce labeled personal custody of tokens a basic freedom. She argued that users should not be told they must hold assets with intermediaries. She linked custody freedom to wallet privacy and said personal control improves system resilience. She then moved to privacy. She said data rights and payment monitoring must protect lawful users. She wants financial privacy to act as a shield for personal property, not a loophole for abuse. She added that new digital-asset plumbing should respect identity rights without exposing transaction history by default. In the long term, she said payment rules should balance lawful compliance with the principle of personal data protection. In the interview, Peirce used a story about watermelon and peanut butter to describe how the public misunderstood early crypto. The point showed that critics often misjudge crypto intentions because of unfamiliar analogies, not evidence. That tension, she said, must fade through readable rules that define tokens precisely. Clear language matters. Written standards reduce cultural misunderstanding. Peirce talked about 2026 with confidence. She sees comprehensive regulation arriving in stages. First comes definitions and issuance paths. Next comes agency coordination. Later comes full implementation. She said the SEC is starting a journey, not closing a debate. The timeline centers on building structure before enforcement. Each stage adds disclosure, licensing logic, custody rights, and oversight splits. She ended the rapid-fire section by framing crypto history in three eras: early invention, exchange-heavy adoption, and now institutional readiness. The third era starts when rules start first. That era lines up with 2025 and stretches into 2026.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,COMMODITY|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-30 19:02:12

As a result, the company is showing improved leverage while funding one of the biggest crypto income pilots for low-income New Yorkers. Coinbase funds $12,000 crypto income pilot for low-income New Yorkers Coinbase is funding a guaranteed-income pilot that sends $12,000 in crypto to selected participants in New York City. The nonprofit GiveDirectly runs the program and issues payments in USDC, a dollar-pegged stablecoin. The initiative uses funds donated by Coinbase after the company ended its earlier GiveCrypto project. First, GiveDirectly enrolled about 160 low-income residents from five boroughs. Next, the program delivers $8,000 as a single payment. Then, it sends an additional $800 each month for five months. In total, each participant receives $12,000, paid fully in USDC. Payment distribution began in late 2024 and continues through 2025. Participants receive support directly into digital wallets without cash transfers or bank intermediaries. Coinbase provided the funding, but it does not manage payments or select recipients. Instead, GiveDirectly handles eligibility, wallet setup, compliance, and delivery. GiveDirectly calls the pilot a targeted guaranteed-income test, not a universal basic income program for all residents. Even so, the program shows one of the largest direct-to-wallet income experiments funded by a crypto company in the U.S. Coinbase revenue climbs for fifth straight quarter as costs ease Meanwhile, Coinbase has grown revenue for five consecutive quarters while keeping operating expenses on a lower track than during the last crypto bull cycle. The move marks an unusual combination in the sector, where rising sales often come with heavier spending. The company’s trailing revenue has now returned to levels last seen at the start of the previous market cycle, according to charts shared by Milk Road. Bars on the revenue chart show a sharp recovery from the 2022–2023 slowdown, with 2025 readings approaching the highs of late 2021. Coinbase Revenue Trailing 2021 to Present. Source: StockAnalysis, Milk Road Crypto At the same time, Coinbase has held expenses below peak-cycle levels. That gap between rising revenue and leaner costs has drawn fresh attention to the firm’s operating leverage as investors track the outlook for COIN shares. Operating expenses stay below prior-cycle peak Coinbase’s latest breakdown of operating costs shows tighter control across major categories, including technology and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative spending. Transaction expense remains a smaller slice of the total stack. Coinbase Operating Expenses Q3 2024 to Q3 2025. Source: Coinbase, Milk Road Crypto For the most recent quarter, Coinbase reported transaction revenue of $1.39 billion, down 9% quarter over quarter but up 34% from a year earlier. Even with that mixed short-term shift, the broader trend pairs higher headline revenue with structurally lower expenses than in 2021. The combination stands out in an industry where exchanges and trading platforms often ramp marketing and headcount as volumes return.

Together, the fund’s inflows and the chart’s bullish structure underline how capital and price action are now aligning on the same chain. Fidelity Tokenized Ethereum Fund Crosses $250M AUM Fidelity’s tokenized money-market fund built on Ethereum has topped $250 million in assets under management (AUM), according to crypto trader Cryptorand. In a post on X, trader Rand said the fund passed the $250 million mark in November 2025. The chart shows a flat line until September. Then the AUM spikes sharply. After that, the total climbs in a steady stair-step pattern and moves past $250 million in late November. The fund launched earlier in 2025 as part of Fidelity’s push into on-chain financial products. It gives investors exposure to short-term money-market yields while settlement and ownership records live on Ethereum. This structure replaces off-chain transfer steps with direct, wallet-to-wallet updates on a shared ledger. As a result, AUM reporting tracks tokenized positions instead of traditional omnibus accounts. The light green trend on the chart signals persistent inflows since September. The first jump takes AUM from $0 to about $200 million. Next, stepwise increases lift the total near $225 million by early November. Finally, the fund expands again and crosses $250 million before month end. Rand also noted RWA (real-world asset) tokenization as a driver of the growth, tying the jump in AUM to broader on-chain demand for yield-bearing instruments. Ethereum hosts several tokenized funds, but this milestone highlights how regulated asset managers are deploying capital into yield products that run financial primitives in code. Meanwhile, Ethereum remains the base layer used for asset state updates, wallet settlement, and composable collateral logic, positioning it at the center of current tokenized money-market expansion. Ethereum Forms Bullish Breakout-Retest Pattern, Analyst Says Ethereum (ETH) is tracing a textbook bullish structure, chart analyst James Bull said on X. His 4-hour TradingView chart shows ETH breaking out of a downtrend, pulling back to the former resistance line and holding it as support near $3,000.

With a total prize pool exceeding $1 million, Digitap ($TAP) has stolen the spotlight from XRP and Solana . This prompts its addition to the list of top altcoins to buy now. This “96 hours of madness,” featuring unique bonuses and rewards (investors should keep their eyes peeled for life-changing drops), has become a major conversation. In addition to the buzz around its Black Friday event, $TAP is considered the best crypto to buy now due to its astounding upside potential as a new low-cap coin. Additionally, its blend of traditional banking and traditional finance positions it as arguably the most promising crypto to buy now . XRP Price Returns to the Upside – Can Bulls Maintain the Trend? Following a decline to $1.8 this week, the XRP price has returned to the upside. An 8% rally on its 7-day chart pushed the payment-based altcoin above $2.1. The overall crypto market’s bounce contributed to this upswing, although additional factors are at play. Is XRP a good crypto to buy at current levels? The launch of XRP ETFs toward the end of November has been a key factor driving the risk-on mode. Inflows into this exchange-traded fund, which highlights growing institutional adoption, contribute to the substantial leap in the XRP price . Cypress Demanincor, boasting a 47,000 follower count on X, predicts the XRP price will reach $3.82 next, followed by a rally toward $4.44 and $5.17 . BTC maintaining key support and its dominance gradually declining may result in a significant jump in the altcoin price, positioning it as a high-potential crypto to buy this cycle. Solana Price Flips Bullish – What’s Next? Similarly, the Solana price has returned to the upside. It revisited the $120 support this week, which many have called a local bottom. Following a 4% gain on its 7-day chart , the Layer-1 coin is back above $140, reflecting growing investor confidence. Mr. APE , a top analyst on X (formerly Twitter), has mixed sentiment. They highlighted the $144 and $146 zone as a strong resistance level, considering previous rejections. Is SOL one of the best altcoins to buy at the current Solana price ? This crypto expert believes the L1 coin is at a crossroads: either break out and revisit $157 or tumble and trade lower. With the market set to determine the next trajectory of the Solana price , many traders are sitting on their hands, waiting for confirmation. However, the launch of SOL ETFs positions the Layer-1 coin among the top altcoins to buy this year and hold for the long term. Digitap: The Best Crypto to Buy Now as $1M Prize Pool Rolls Out in the Biggest Black Friday This weekend promises to be the most exciting yet, as Digitap begins its Black Friday event. A nonstop 96 hours of mouthwatering drops, totaling more than $1 million in value, have investors and crypto participants refreshing the official Digitap page.

However, it will only be on a first-come, first-served basis. Offers are only active for the hour they appear—they vanish afterwards and are replaced by another.

More importantly, only 60 minutes is allocated to claim each hourly offer—reload and check the widget on the official page to unlock surprise and fresh deals. Unsurprisingly, bids have been flying as investors doubled down on the ongoing $TAP presale (early funding has surpassed $2.2 million). Another key factor driving significant demand and interest is the universal money problems Digitap solves in the cross-border payments market. It slashes the remittance costs from the 6.2% industry average to sub-1%. Additionally, its crypto card is globally accepted in-store and online, prompting experts to dub $TAP the best crypto to buy now . $1 MILLION in CASH, PRIZES, GIVEAWAYS.

Meanwhile, BTC has bounced from a crash, recovered above key support, and is now testing strong resistance zones again on Binance charts. Bitcoin Joins 1,000-Year League of Disruptive Technologies Bank of America Global Research has placed Bitcoin alongside some of history’s biggest breakthroughs in a chart tracking “1,000 Years of Technological Disruption.” The graphic, shared by trader Rand on X, plots world population growth since the year 1000 and marks milestones such as the printing press, steam engine, telegraph, light bulb and Model T. Near the steepest part of the curve, it labels recent shifts including the World Wide Web, iPhone, social media, electric vehicles, CRISPR, artificial intelligence and quantum computing, with Bitcoin highlighted among them. In the chart, Bitcoin appears in the cluster of modern digital innovations that accompany the sharp rise in global population and economic complexity. By placing the cryptocurrency beside earlier turning points like microprocessors and spaceflight, the research desk signals that Bitcoin’s emergence sits within a broader pattern of tools that reshape finance, communication and industry. At the same time, its position near AI and quantum computing underlines how banks and investors now treat blockchain-based assets as part of the current wave of structural technology change rather than a stand-alone experiment. Analyst Says Bitcoin Momentum Hits Rare Lows After Crash Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s latest slide has pushed momentum indicators to some of their weakest readings in years, according to trader Michaël van de Poppe. Citing his charts, he said the recent correction drove Bitcoin’s daily relative strength index to its lowest level in nearly two years and sent the MACD gauge to its weakest print on record. Bitcoin Most Oversold Since Aug 2023: Source: Michaël van de Poppe In his view, those signals show Bitcoin trading far below a “fair price,” which he estimates near 160,000 dollars. As a result, he argued that the probability of revisiting cycle lows now looks smaller than the odds of a sharp rebound higher. He pointed to previous cycles where deep oversold readings preceded fast recoveries once selling pressure eased. At the same time, van de Poppe said a decisive break above a key resistance level could trigger a swift move, as short positions face liquidation and sidelined cash waits for confirmation to reenter the market. He added that past bull runs often began when heavily shorted levels gave way, releasing built-up leverage on the way up. Bitcoin Tests Heavy Resistance After Sunday Bounce Bitcoin moved back into a major resistance zone after a sharp weekend rebound, according to a chart shared by analyst Ted (@TedPillows). On the daily BTC/USDT chart from Binance, price has snapped higher from the low-$80,000 area and now trades just above $91,000, pressing into a red supply band around $93,500. Bitcoin Major Resistance Zone. Source: Ted (@TedPillows) First, the chart shows a vertical selloff from above $110,000 that sliced through several former support levels. Then, buyers stepped in near the green demand zone around $81,000–$83,000, driving a rapid recovery that Ted describes as the “Sunday pump.” The move has carried Bitcoin straight into overhead resistance, where previous consolidation and breakdown began. Next, Ted’s map outlines several paths from here. One set of arrows sketches a rejection at the current band, with price ranging between roughly $89,500 support and the $93,500 ceiling before any fresh move. Another path shows a clean break higher toward stacked resistance levels near $98,000 and $101,972 if buyers absorb supply. A final scenario points to a deeper drop back toward the $82,000 area if the bounce fails.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|RESEARCH|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-30 19:25:44

By 2028, SOL is expected to reach a new high of $757.87, driven by mainstream adoption of its dApps. Solana’s price could surpass the $1,000 mark, potentially reaching $1,249.82 or higher by 2031. Despite occasional challenges for the Solana network ecosystem, including network congestion and competition from other blockchain platforms, the current sentiment shows that Solana demonstrates resilience and adaptability, despite the current price fluctuations, positioning itself as a leading player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 landscape. Overall, the prevailing sentiment regarding the current Solana price within the Solana community reflects the current sentiment of confidence and excitement among investors, driven by the growing interest in Solana with stakeholders eagerly anticipating the platform’s continued evolution and impact on the broader crypto ecosystem. While uncertainties persist, Solana’s innovative approach, along with its low transaction fees and robust infrastructure instill optimism for its future price action, as indicated by the technical factors and technical analysis. In this article, we’ll explore Solana price prediction and market dominance, particularly when evaluated against momentum indicators. This brings the question “How high can SOL go in 2025 and beyond?” and we’ll try to answer that. Overview Cryptocurrency Solana Token SOL Price $139.32 (+1.46%) Market Cap $77.94 Billion Trading Volume (24-hour) $2.96 Billion Circulating Supply 559.03 Million SOL All-time High $294.33 Jan 19, 2025 All-time Low $0.5052, May 11, 2020 24-hour High $139.94 24-hour Low $135.12 Solana price prediction: Technical analysis Sentiment Bearish 50-Day SMA $169.10 200-Day SMA $179.17 Price Prediction $306.63 (119.98%) F & G Index 46.69 (fear) Green Days 16/30 (54%) 14-Day RSI 46.28 Solana price analysis: SOL rises towards $140 TL;DR Breakdown: Solana price analysis confirmed a bullish sentiment as price rises towards $140. The altcoin gained 1.46% of its value across last 24-hours. Support for SOL/USD is at $135. As of November 30, the Solana price analysis reveals a slightly bullish market sentiment as the price recovers towards the $140 mark. Overall the altcoin has gained 1.46% of its value across the last 24-hours rising to the $140 resistance level. Solana price analysis 1-day chart: SOL rises to $140 resistance The one-day price chart of the Solana confirms a small price incline, but overall, the trend remains undecided. The SOL/USD pair value rose to $139.33 today. The appearance of a green candlestick on the price chart signifies the presence of bullish elements. SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview The distance between the Bollinger Bands defines the level of volatility. This distance between high and low bands is narrow, leading to low volatility. Moving ahead, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance band, has shifted to $152.18. The indicator’s lower limit, which shows a support level, has shifted to $124.98 The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is present in the neutral area but is quite close to the mean region. The indicator’s value has increased to index 42.83, and its upwards curve signifies a dominance of buyers. If buying activities continue to intensify, further volatility in the market can be expected. SOL/USD 4-hour price chart The four-hour price analysis of the Solana token shows the presence of buyers’ support at the current price level. The altcoin’s price has increased to $140 as bulls attempt to dominate the price action. Low levels of volatility mark a decreased chance of a reversal in market trends or further price appreciation on the 4-hour chart. SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview The Bollinger Bands have converged, hinting at a low volatility level. This low level of volatility signifies increased market predictability. Moving forward, the upper Bollinger Band has shifted to $142.74, securing the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger Band has moved to $134.21, indicating support. The RSI indicator is in the neutral region. Currently at 55.22 the RSI curve is pointing upwards, confirming an increase in buying activities.

Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana’s (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150. In May the price continued to rise and ended the month above the $165 price level, a trend that could not extend through June as the month saw a decline falling below the $150 price level to end the month. July saw a sharp rise to the asset’s volatility with SOL crossing the $200 mark. However, the price could not be maintained and SOL ended the month below the $180 level. In August, on the other hand, SOL made strides and managed to close the month above the $205 mark. In September, the volatility rose sharply as the price rose to the $250 price level but failed to maintain the level and ended the month at $230. In October, the decline increased sharply as SOL ended the month below $170.",Crypto Price Predictions|Solana,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-30 19:30:00

South Korea’s largest online retailer Coupang suffered a data breach affecting 33.7 million customer accounts, exposing names, phone numbers, email addresses, shipping addresses, and order histories. Coupang is currently being investigated by South Korean regulators to determine whether the company had any fault in the breach. Coupang confirms 33.7 million breached accounts South Korean e-commerce giant Coupang confirmed that the personal information from 33.7 million customer accounts was compromised through unauthorized access. The breach affects nearly two-thirds of South Korea’s total population. “We sincerely apologise once again for causing our customers inconvenience” Coupang’s CEO Park Dae-jun said in a statement posted on the company’s website. The company discovered the breach on November 18 and initially reported that approximately 4,500 customer accounts were affected. However, subsequent investigations revealed that the number of compromised accounts is up to 33.7 million. The exposed data includes names, email addresses, phone numbers, shipping addresses, and certain order histories, but does not include even more sensitive information like payment details or login credentials. Cybersecurity experts have warned that the compromised data could still be used for identity theft, phishing attacks, and other malicious purposes. The company reported that it had 24.7 million active commercial users in the third quarter, meaning the breach might have affected data from former customers and dormant accounts. Some of Coupang’s affected customers are reportedly preparing a class-action lawsuit in response to the incident. The Minister of Science and ICT, Bae Kyung-hoon confirmed that the government held an emergency meeting and is investigating whether Coupang violated safety rules regarding personal information protection. The Ministry of Science and ICT formed a joint investigation team to analyze the cause of the incident. According to reports from Yonhap News Agency, a former Chinese employee at Coupang is suspected to be behind the breach, but that individual has left the country. Coupang filed a formal complaint earlier this month with the police, but did not name a suspect in its filing. Frequent cyber attacks in South Korea Earlier this year, SK Telecom , South Korea’s largest mobile carrier, experienced its own devastating breach that exposed phone numbers, subscriber identification numbers, and SIM authentication keys belonging to 23.2 million users. In August, South Korea’s privacy regulator imposed a record fine of 134.8 billion won ($97.2 million) on SK Telecom, stating that the company had “basic security failures and poor management” that left it vulnerable to cyber attacks. The regulator found that SK Telecom failed to encrypt 26.1 million SIM authentication keys, leaving them exposed in plain-text databases, and ignored intrusion detection logs while not applying available security patches. Other major companies have faced similar issues , such as the Telecommunications firm KT Corp. and financial services company Lotte Card, which both announced data leaks in recent months. South Korean regulators have shown that they expect companies to take customer protection seriously with the record fine imposed on SK Telecom earlier this year. Coupang could face similar consequences depending on the findings of the ongoing investigation. Coupang has stated that it is cooperating fully with authorities and has blocked the unauthorized access route. The company’s internal monitoring systems have also been reportedly strengthened.

With these investment products, people get to participate in the cryptocurrency market without having to directly own the digital assets. Interestingly, one of the biggest winners—that often gets overlooked—has been the issuers, especially as the crypto industry has seen increased institutional adoption since the Bitcoin ETFs launched. According to the firm’s executive, the BTC exchange-traded funds becoming the major source of revenue for BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, was not envisioned. BlackRock’s Bitcoin Funds Outweighing Expectations At the Blockchain Conference 2025 in São Paulo on Friday, November 28, BlackRock’s business development director in Brazil, Cristiano Castro, told reporters that the Bitcoin ETFs are the largest revenue source for their company. According to the executive, this development came as a “big surprise” to the asset management firm.

Castro said in a statement: We were very optimistic when we launched, but we didn’t believe it would reach such proportions. Just to give you an idea, it [IBIT in the US and IBIT39 in Brazil – the asset’s reference names] came very close to US$100 billion [in allocation]. This feat is notable for the Bitcoin ETFs, especially considering that BlackRock offers more than 1,400 exchange-traded products globally and has a whopping $13.4 trillion in assets under management. The US-based Bitcoin fund (with the IBIT ticker) has over $70.7 billion in net assets, becoming the first ETF to reach the $70-billion mark (doing so in June 2025). While the US Bitcoin ETF market has somewhat slowed down, BlackRock’s IBIT still continues to outpace other ETFs launched in recent years. As earlier reports suggested, IBIT had managed to generate roughly $245 million in annual fees as of October 2025. Bitcoin ETF Outflows ‘Perfectly Normal’ – Castro When asked about the recent outflows from BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF as the market leader’s value fell, the director stated that there are zero surprises in that trend. “ETFs are very liquid and powerful instruments, and they serve precisely to allow people to allocate their capital and manage their cash flow,” Castro noted. The BlackRock director said that the withdrawals are expected, considering that the product is heavily owned by retail investors, who are reactionary in nature to price corrections. On Friday, the iShares Bitcoin Trust saw a net outflow of $113.72 million, bringing the weekly record to a negative $137.01 million and the fund to its fifth-consecutive week of withdrawals.

Trump, who avoided giving details, made this statement following the ongoing military buildup in the Caribbean for weeks, bringing the “risk of imminent war” in the region back onto the agenda. The Venezuelan government has described the US actions as a “colonialist threat to Latin America,” while President Nicolás Maduro has argued that Washington is “trying to fabricate justifications to pave the way for military intervention.” Caracas has been holding regular military exercises in recent weeks and calling for “wide-scale mobilization” against a potential attack. The Trump administration has deployed a massive naval force to the southern Caribbean since early September. While the US claims these operations are “anti-drug trafficking,” no evidence has been released to suggest the targeted boats are drug-related. At least 83 people have been killed in the attacks to date. Last week, Washington further escalated pressure on the Cartel de los Soles, a group long associated with Venezuela's security apparatus, by designating it a “foreign terrorist organization.” Critics say these steps are part of an unlawful process to overthrow Maduro's government. From the beginning of his second term, Trump declared Maduro a “global terrorist leader,” imposed a 25% additional tariff on countries buying Venezuelan oil, and increased the reward for Maduro’s capture to $50 million. In recent weeks, the US has deployed the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier, other warships, thousands of troops, and F-35 fighter jets to the region. Trump, in his recent remarks, has stated that ground attacks inside the country are “imminent.” According to reports in The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, Trump held a phone call with Maduro last week. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump said, “I might talk to him. Maybe. We're talking.” Related News: A Country Announces a $300 Million Cryptocurrency Investment Directly from Its Foreign Exchange Reserves When asked by a journalist why he wanted to meet with Maduro, who was declared a “terrorist organization leader” by the US, Trump responded as follows: “If we can save lives, we'll take the easy way. If necessary, we'll take the hard way.” The Trump administration's deadly air and naval strikes in the Caribbean have drawn harsh criticism for violating both the U.S. Constitution and international law. According to the Washington Post, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the military to “kill all passengers on boats suspected of carrying drugs.” Hegseth denied the allegations, calling them “fake news,” but Congress has launched a formal investigation into the incident. The impact of US-Venezuela tensions on global markets could be particularly critical for Bitcoin. When geopolitical risks rise, investors typically turn to safe assets, but in recent years, Bitcoin has at times taken on a geopolitical hedge role similar to gold. While the FED is expected to cut interest rates in December, a possible war on the Washington-Caracas line could completely change this picture. In a scenario where tensions rise with a limited operation but not outright war, Bitcoin could initially experience volatility due to global risk-off behavior. US air or missile strikes against limited targets within Venezuela could briefly raise oil prices and create market unrest, but they might not cause widespread geopolitical disruption. In such a scenario, BTC's volatility could remain limited if the Fed doesn't shelve interest rate cuts. In a scenario where the US moves beyond its limited operations and begins using ground troops inside Venezuela, leading to a more widespread military operation, global markets could enter a sharp risk-off period. A rise in oil prices above $100 could disrupt inflation expectations and force the Fed to cancel its December interest rate cut. As economic uncertainty grows, Bitcoin may generally price the initial shock negatively. *This is not investment advice.

A new report by CoinGecko found that the DEX-to-CEX spot ratio rose from 6.0% in January 2021 to 21.2% in November 2025. According to the data, this growth has not followed a straight upward path. After reaching 14.6% in early 2022, the ratio slid to a low of 5.4% by September of that year and then moved within a similar band through the end of 2024. DEXs’ Market Share Soars CoinGecko explained that the collapse of FTX in November 2022 did not have an immediate effect on DEX usage relative to centralized platforms, as the ratio only crossed back above 10.0% in March 2023 during a period marked by intensified US regulatory pressure. A decisive shift appeared at the start of 2025, when the ratio climbed to 18.7% in January. This increase was fueled by a surge in Solana-based meme coin frenzy that pushed overall DEX spot volume to $413.75 billion, thereby overtaking the previous cycle’s peak. During the same month, Raydium’s trading volume doubled to $88.56 billion, which put it nearly level with Uniswap’s $88.92 billion for the first time. The upward trend accelerated again in June 2025, when the ratio reached a new all-time high of 37.4%. CoinGecko attributes this jump largely to PancakeSwap, which saw volumes spike following the launch of Binance Alpha in May, a platform that routed a significant share of orders to the exchange. Since then, the ratio has settled into a steadier range, and November was the fifth consecutive month in which decentralized platforms held roughly 20% of total spot trading activity, a level that is far higher than the relatively flat ratios recorded in earlier years. The report added that DEX volumes from May through October remained high compared to historical levels and led to an all-time high of $419.76 billion in October despite broader market corrections. DEX Perps Expansion Decentralized exchanges have rapidly gained ground in perpetual trading as well. The DEX to CEX perps volume ratio surged from 2.1% in January 2023 to a fresh peak of 11.7% in November 2025. Interestingly, November also marked the 14th consecutive month of month-on-month growth in DEX perps volumes. Overall DEX perps trading hit a record $903.56 billion in October, more than ten times the level seen a year earlier. Growth has been driven by new entrants such as Hyperliquid, Lighter, and edgeX, which have outpaced earlier DEX incumbents. Hyperliquid has handled $2.74 trillion in perpetuals this year, matching Coinbase and beating all other top DEXs combined.

Evernorth, a firm widely reported to be building a large publicly disclosed XRP treasury, is identified as the most significant net holder in the period under review and was reported to have no outflows on the specific day of the snapshot. Evernorth’s accumulation and public fundraising efforts have been documented in several reports detailing sizeable purchases and commitments to hold XRP in institutional treasury structures. Red flags and uneven outflow patterns While aggregate exchange balances are down materially year-to-date, the distribution of outflows is uneven across venues. Certain platforms experienced extreme daily declines, with Bitget and Stake among those showing large percentage reductions in balance on the cited day. Other venues such as BTC Markets, Bitso, and Luno are described as exhibiting multi-month decreases in held XRP. These asymmetric flows suggest that the reduction in on-exchange liquidity is not uniform and may be driven by a mix of institutionally led accumulation, custodial relocations, and local market dynamics. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market interpretation and participant commentary A leading community commentator interpreted the pattern as more than routine rebalancing, arguing that the scale and timing of the redistribution point to coordinated accumulation ahead of broader market developments. That commentary highlighted that on-chain indicators are frequently ahead of price reaction and framed the observed liquidity migration as a prelude to a larger structural shift in supply available to spot markets. Such assessments align with reporting that institutional treasury activity has influenced exchange inventories in recent months. The November 29 exchange flow readout presents a clear picture: exchange-held XRP continues to fall , with concentrated accumulation by institutional entities and pronounced outflows at select venues. Whether these movements presage significant price adjustments or reflect longer-term custody strategies will depend on subsequent flow and how readily the removed supply returns to active markets.

55165499,https://coinpaper.com/12767/dogecoin-whales-mysteriously-vanish-what-are-they-waiting-for,1764532963,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png,Dogecoin Whales Mysteriously Vanish — What Are They Waiting For?,https://coinpaper.com/12767/dogecoin-whales-mysteriously-vanish-what-are-they-waiting-for,"Dogecoin large holders have slowed their activity despite the arrival of the first spot DOGE ETFs in the United States. The shift occurs at a time when the broader cryptocurrency market is losing momentum, resulting in reduced dramatic trading patterns that characterized earlier periods of volatility. Whale Activity Hits Two-Month Low Blockchain data shows that Dogecoin whales have reached their lowest activity level in two months. Analyst Ali reports that the slowdown reflects a quiet stretch across major digital assets, where sharp intraday swings have eased. The change has raised questions about whether whales are waiting for improved market conditions or bracing for further weakness. Source: X The reduced activity coincides with Dogecoin’s narrow price range since mid-October. The asset has held between $0.133 and $0.20 for several weeks. At the time of this publication, Dogecoin is trading at around $0.15, suggesting a 1.08% increase in the last 24 hours. DOGE price chart, Source: CoinMarketCap The upper boundary at $0.20 remains a strong resistance zone. Any attempt at a breakout may struggle if market sentiment remains weak. Dogecoin face immediate resistance at $0.156, which marked a clear rejection on Nov. 26 after a short recovery streak. ETF Launch Generates Limited Impact The launch of spot Dogecoin ETFs was expected to inject fresh interest into the market. Grayscale introduced its DOGE ETF, listed under the ticker GDOG, on the New York Stock Exchange at the start of the week. Bitwise also rolled out its own Dogecoin product under the 20-day 8(a) window, marking a rare moment of institutional expansion for the meme-inspired asset. Despite these developments, market reaction remained subdued. GDOG recorded a debut trading volume of $1.4 million, falling below industry expectations. Analysts say the modest start reflects the timing of the launch, which arrives during a period of reduced enthusiasm across altcoins. Weaker price action and low whale participation may have dampened appetite for new exposure. Regulators in the United States are still reviewing a 21Shares filing for a non-leveraged Dogecoin ETF. Approval could add another gateway for institutional investors, but observers caution that the current environment may limit near-term inflows. The muted response also contrasts with earlier ETF rollouts in the crypto sector. Products tied to Bitcoin and Ethereum saw stronger initial demand, driven by broader market optimism. In contrast, the latest wave of altcoin ETFs is entering a market that appears more cautious, with investors weighing macro risks and shifting liquidity conditions. Technical Outlook Remains Fragile Dogecoin’s technical setup reflects ongoing uncertainty. The asset continues to trade within a tight range, showing little sign of decisive momentum. Bears point to declining whale activity as a signal that large holders may not expect immediate upside. Bulls, however, argue that reduced movement may indicate consolidation before a stronger directional shift. Resistance at $0.156 and $0.20 will be key levels to watch. A move above these thresholds could help restore short-term confidence, though sustained buying pressure remains uncertain. Support near $0.133 has held for several weeks, suggesting that sellers are hesitant to push the price significantly lower without new catalysts.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-30 20:02:43
