Interestingly, CryptoQuant data now reveals that spot trading volume across exchanges reached $375 billion in November. Meanwhile, exchange-traded fund (ETF) volume climbed to nearly $35 billion. Institutional Money Pours In According to the analysis, Ethereum began the year with significant volatility in monthly trading activity, with total volume fluctuating between roughly $280 billion and $380 billion before accelerating sharply in the middle of the year. That surge eventually led to a peak of more than $599 billion in August, and marked the highest monthly trading volume recorded during the period. Following this spike, trading activity eased but stayed comparatively strong, and ended November at around $375 billion, a level that indicates continued market participation despite ongoing price pressures. CryptoQuant found that Binance remained the dominant venue for Ethereum trading, and recorded approximately $198 billion in spot trading volume during November alone. This figure underscores Binance’s central role in real-time liquidity flows and its position as the leading platform for both institutional and retail traders executing high-volume transactions. Data also shows that institutional interest played a meaningful role through regulated investment vehicles, with Ethereum spot ETFs registering about $35 billion in trading volume for the month. Such a level of ETF activity points to continued engagement from traditional market participants and adds an additional layer of “organized liquidity” to overall Ethereum market flows during the period. Currently, Ethereum is seeing renewed confidence from large investors as whale activity increasingly leans toward long positions, according to Alphractal’s Whale vs Retail Delta metric. On the price front, ETH has climbed above $3,000. Despite remaining around 24% lower over the month, the asset’s recovery coincided with aggressive accumulation from major holders. As recently reported by CryptoPotato, wallets holding 10,000-100,000 ETH now control a record level of over 21 million ETH, while entities with over 100,000 ETH have expanded their balance to around 4.3 million ETH. ETH Near Neutral Zone Further analysis reveals that Ethereum is trading near fair-value territory, as important on-chain indicators point to a sensitive phase in the market. Ethereum’s Realized Price stands at $2,315 and an MVRV ratio of 1.27. This places the asset in a neutral zone where the market price sits just 27% above the Realized Price, which shows neither overbought nor oversold conditions. Binance-specific data reflects an even sharper shift, as Ethereum’s MVRV ratio on the exchange hovers near 0.999, just below the historically important threshold of 1.0. A reading under 1 means that market capitalization is aligning with the Realized Price, pushing most investors into a “no-profit, no-loss” position. This zone has historically coincided with early market bottoms or extended periods of price weakness. On the other hand, long-term MVRV readings above 3 typically correspond with overbought phases, while values below 1 indicate market troughs characterized by unrealized losses. The current ratio of 1.27 points to a balanced market structure with no strong signals of extreme valuation.

In an interview with Altcoin Daily, he argued that many newly launched networks, despite attracting early investor attention, lack sustainable fundamentals and carry inflated valuations. Hayes emphasized that initial hype often creates short-term price gains but does not guarantee enduring success for these projects. Monad and the Risks of High-Valuation L1s Hayes specifically highlighted Monad, a recently launched L1 backed by Coinbase Ventures. At the time of his statement, MON token had risen 45% since its ICO, reaching roughly $0.037 with a market capitalization near $398 million. Despite these gains, Hayes expects a dramatic decline, citing the coin’s high fully diluted valuation and low circulating supply. He noted that many new L1s follow a pattern of early surges followed by sharp corrections, driven by initial investor optimism rather than fundamental value. According to Hayes, new L1 projects often attract attention because investors hope to discover the next Ethereum. Early pumps create excitement, but most tokens fail to maintain momentum once hype fades. Venture capital support may temporarily prop up prices, but Hayes warned that this does not guarantee long-term success. Consequently, he believes most L1 tokens outside Ethereum and Solana are destined for collapse. Ethereum and Solana: The Standout Networks Despite the challenges facing newer L1s, Hayes identifies Ethereum and Solana as exceptions. He sees Ethereum as the foundation for institutional blockchain adoption. Large banks and organizations now prefer public networks over private chains due to security and utility advantages. Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism will help Ethereum scale while maintaining privacy, positioning it for sustained growth. Solana, according to Hayes, remains the second-largest L1, benefiting previously from meme coin activity. However, he acknowledges that meme-driven growth has slowed. Solana will need a new catalyst to maintain user engagement and price momentum. While Hayes remains skeptical that it will surpass Ethereum, he believes the network will continue to play a significant role in the blockchain ecosystem. Hayes’ Magnificent Five In addition to Ethereum and Solana, Hayes named Bitcoin, Zcash, and Ethena as his top cryptocurrency picks. These networks combine adoption, security, and practical utility, which he considers critical for long-term success. By contrast, most other L1 tokens face a high risk of decline as early enthusiasm fades.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|SOL|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-29 19:50:13

The momentum is gaining traction at an accelerated pace, and the preliminary indications are that this project could be among the best cryptocurrencies to follow in the coming 2026. As the demand is growing by the day, there are several traders who are worried about not getting one of the most desired early performances of the year. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building two lending markets in its protocol. P2C Lending: Under its derivative services called Peer-to-Contracts, buyers can post assets and earn mtTokens, which are equivalent to deposits for them and generate APY as borrowers use them. As an example, a person who provides $1,000 of USDC may be issued several mtUSDC, the value of which increases with the payment of interest by borrowers. The yield also depends on demand, and therefore, the more the borrowers the more the APY of the suppliers. P2P Marketplace: Mutuum Finance is also developing a Peer-to-peer marketplace and the users get to create single borrowing agreements. The rates are based on utilization and risk. Borrowers have options on whether to accept variable or in certain cases stable rates in case they want to have known costs on repaying loans. Loan to Value restrictions insure positions. The LTVs of lower-volatility investments such as the ETF remain at an average of 75%, whereas more aggressive prices remain only at 35%-40%. In case the value of collateral is low, the protocol causes the liquidation. Liquidators purchase collateral at a discount and redeem some of the debt held by the borrower, and this is to take care of system losses. Presale Progress, Funding Milestones and Demand Since it was launched in the beginning of 2025, momentum has been fast-paced at Mutuum Finance. The initial price was at $0.01 and now it is $0.035 with the price value increasing by 250%. The initial price is established as $0.06, which could imply a good increase in the price when the demand is maintained. The project has gathered a total of $19M funds and over 18,200 holders. Out of 4B supply of tokens, the presale has been allotted 45.5% which equals to 1.82B tokens. Of the same, 800M tokens are already owned. The momentum is high and Phase 6 is at the last leg with allocation standing at high above 92%. Mutuum Finance also operates a 24 hour leaderboard where the leader each day gets $500 in MUTM as a prize. This promotes the incessant use and assists in attracting new users into the system. The card payments also make participation possible in presale since buyers can immediately participate without any supplementary actions. The prelaunch crypto demand keeps gaining momentum with more and more traders seeking the most favorable crypto to purchase before launch. The window to enter at $0.035 is closing quicker than projected. V1 Check Mutuum Finance has assured using the official X account that the V1 of the protocol will launch on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. The initial one will consist of a liquidity pool, mtToken mechanisms, a debt-tracking token, and the liquidation bot. ETH and USDT will be accommodated initially. Another significant highlight is security. Mutuum Finance underwent a CertiK audit with a 90/100 Token Scan rating, with a thorough review of the lending and borrowing agreements currently being done by Halborn Security . This essay analyzes that a powerful audit, solid product roadmap, and fast presale growth, combined, might potentially put MUTM in one of the strongest early moves in 2026. According to the commentators in the market, it can further increase above $0.06 launch price in case the demand keeps rising considering the increased interest by the whale buyers. Layer-2 Expansion and Why It Matters The team is also gearing towards adding layer-2 expansion and seek to deploy on chains characterized by a lower fee and increased throughput. The reason behind this is that in cases where borrowing and lending are easy and inexpensive, DeFi platforms expand. Increased L2 coverage may also increase the number of total users and enhance liquidity. Such measures are important since users who seek to know what crypto to invest their money tend to select those projects that already display extensive planning rather than just through marketing or hype. Mutuum Finance possesses physical infrastructure in place, defined security level, and various avenues to grow upon the launching. Cash is flowing within investors and is moving fast with Phase 6 approaching a total of 100% sellout. Having increased its price by 250%, powerful DeFi mechanics, solid roadmap, large audits, plans of a layer-2, and growing purchasing force, Mutuum Finance is turning out to be among the most popular cryptocurrencies in 2026.

Monero is an attractive investment because it emphasizes privacy and security, utilizing advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure transaction confidentiality, which has created a strong demand in the market . Its growing adoption across various use cases and a decentralized development model enhance its long-term potential. With a limited supply and increasing investor interest, Monero offers a unique opportunity for those seeking financial autonomy and privacy to invest in cryptocurrency. However, investors should remain cautious of regulatory risks and market volatility when considering Monero as part of their portfolio, making it essential to seek investment advice. Why is XMR up? Monero price analysis shows that XMR saw a swift rise to the $407 mark before falling back to the $385 mark where it found support to continue the rally to the current $410 mark. Will XMR recover to its all-time high? Monero is expected to recover toward its all-time high of $518 by mid-2026 as the privacy chain continues to reduce its tech debt and progresses toward greater utility and privacy. However, the platform might have to overcome regulatory scrutiny and challenges before it can see mass adoption, as it remains highly speculative . How much will Monero be worth in 5 years? The Monero price prediction for 2030 suggests a minimum price of $1,048.76 and an average trading price of $1,142.11 . The maximum forecasted price is set at $1,208.35. Will XMR reach $1000? The chances of Monero (XMR) hitting $1,000 hinge on various factors, which will influence its future price movements. The adoption of privacy transactions and technological advances could increase demand. Favorable regulations and market sentiment toward privacy coins would also help. Yet, regulatory risks, competition, and market volatility are challenges that monero traders could face could hinder significant growth. $1,000 is possible with favorable conditions, especially considering the current price but market dynamics and regulations will shape its path. Does XMR have a good long-term future? Monero (XMR) has the potential for a strong long-term future due to its focus on privacy and security, which makes it attractive to users seeking anonymity. However, many investors have concerns regarding privacy, regulatory scrutiny, and notoriety from being the favored medium for some past criminals, which impact the current Monero sentiment. Monero’s commitment to ring confidential transactions and privacy gives it a solid foundation for long-term growth, but it must carefully navigate market and regulatory landscapes.

The highest price was $278.56, and the lowest was $114.16. In January 2024, Monero stayed stable around the $150.00 mark as market momentum remained low. However, the stability was short-lived as February crashed to $101.95. However, XMR showed swift recovery as it closed the month near the $150.00 level again. In March and April 2024, XMR saw a steady decline from $150.00 to $120.00, where it found key support. In May 2024, XMR observed steady bullish pressure as the price rose from $120.00, approaching resistance at $150.

In July, the crypto traded around the $155 mark as the price volatility remained relatively low. XMR opened trading at $156.05 in August and ended the month at $176.00, making remarkable gains. September was bearish for the asset, as the price declined below the $160 mark by the end of the month. In October, Monero observed a steep crash and has been making a swift recovery since then.

During June the price continued to observe high volatility but observed low net change as the asset closed the month around $313.

He linked gold’s long history as a neutral asset to the rise of XRP. He shared a video where gold wholesaler Chris Olson spoke on Tucker Carlson’s show. Olson discussed government control over wealth. Aljarrah explained why he views gold and XRP as aligned with personal sovereignty. He views XRP as a neutral bridge , playing a role similar to gold in the digital age. Gold is the only form of freedom that has survived every collapse. Neutral. Answers to no government. Answers to no bank. XRP is the evolution of that same principle, a neutral bridge for a digital world. If you understand sovereignty, you hold both. pic.twitter.com/gnqFn03KSF — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) November 28, 2025 A Focus on Control Olson’s remarks created a direct contrast between individual autonomy and the modern tax system. He said, “We were a free country once,” while describing the current approach to income reporting. He argued that the state views earnings as a resource to be managed rather than a private matter. His view centered on the claim that the government chooses to use the people as a source of revenue. He then pointed out how much time citizens work each year to meet their IRS obligations. He linked that burden to foreign policy spending that many taxpayers do not support. This argument fits Aljarrah’s point. The concern is not about ordinary taxation. It is about a structure that can hinder families’ ability to protect assets or build long-term stability. Olson said the system does not let families preserve and transmit generational wealth. Why Aljarrah Connects Gold and XRP While some analysts believe XRP can replicate Gold’s market performance , Aljarrah sees a deeper connection. He framed gold as a form of freedom that has survived every collapse. He described it as neutral and outside the reach of both governments and banks. He then presented XRP as the digital evolution of that idea. He described XRP as a neutral bridge suited for the global movement of value. The message linked physical and digital stores of value. The comparison reflects a view held by many XRP supporters. XRP does not grant governments the ability to freeze or reverse transactions at the protocol level. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Even Ripple has no control over XRP . It moves value across borders in seconds without relying on traditional banking rails. This structure matches the principle Olson defended in his interview. It favors systems that let individuals operate without unnecessary oversight. XRP’s Role Today Olson’s remarks on state control highlight why many view XRP as a neutral asset. XRP offers fast settlement, low cost, and clear user control. Aljarrah links it to Gold as a tool for personal autonomy. He sees XRP as a direct, sovereign option for a digital financial system. According to Aljarrah, anyone who understands sovereignty holds both gold and XRP. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Expert Answers,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/whats-going-on-behind-the-scenes-with-xrp-expert-answers/,"Conversations around XRP have grown louder in recent weeks as the cryptocurrency continues to trade around the $2.2 region while new Spot XRP ETFs continue to attract inflows across multiple issuers. One voice in the community has attempted to explain why the market is unusually calm despite rising institutional demand. An XRP enthusiast known as Pumpius shared a detailed thread on X that breaks down the mechanics behind the new ETFs and why the real impact may still be ahead. His argument is that the current XRP price action does not yet reflect what is going on behind the scenes. Related Reading: Bitcoin Maxi Says ATH Back On The Table After 40x Derivatives Surge Why ETF Rules Create A Special Market Dynamic Pumpius explained that the foundation of the entire setup is in one legal detail with fund managers. ETF fund managers are restricted from purchasing XRP directly from Ripple or from the escrow accounts that hold large reserves of the token. Every ETF must source XRP through open-market purchases, without private deals or wholesale arrangements. The absence of direct acquisition forces institutional buyers into the same liquidity pool as retail and whales. With the new launch of XRP ETFs, and as demand continues to rise, the circulating supply is now the battleground, and this mechanical pressure is already visible in recent weeks as XRP trading volumes climbed while exchange supply began trending downward. According to market trackers, XRP supply on major exchanges has declined steadily since the approval of the first Spot XRP ETFs, showing that the stress on available liquidity is not theoretical but active. Particularly, data from CryptoQuant shows that Binance’s XRP reserves are now at their lowest point in months, having dropped to 2.7 billion tokens this week. Incoming Supply Squeeze For XRP Another part of the explanation focuses on Ripple’s behavior regarding escrow releases. Although one billion XRP is unlocked each month, Ripple has repeatedly returned about 700 million to 800 million of these unlocked tokens back into escrow. Ripple releases only what it considers necessary to maintain healthy liquidity in the ecosystem, and the company has avoided significant selling pressure since the ETF approvals. According to Pumpius, this means the ecosystem is operating in a controlled balance where ETF issuers are absorbing a growing share of the circulating float, while Ripple keeps escrow output extremely conservative. The result is a slow tightening of supply that’s happening behind the scenes and may not yet be visible in price action but can eventually cause what he called a structural supply shock. When this happens, XRP will not move slowly, but it will break price levels with impact.

Its iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) recorded significant outflows in the week from November 21 to November 28, 2025, totaling $113.70 million. On November 21, the ETF saw an outflow of $122 million, followed by another $149.1 million on November 22. The next two days brought some relief, with inflows of $83 million on November 23 and $61.5 million on November 24. However, this brief recovery was overshadowed by a sharp outflow on November 25, pushing the total net outflow for the week to $113.7 million. Despite the mix of inflows and outflows, the net negative movement remains a red flag. After outflows of $271.1 million in the first two days, the inflows that followed were not enough to offset the heavy losses. Bitcoin ETFs inflows. Source: Coinglass Indeed, the outflows are likely to add more pressure to Bitcoin’s price, which is struggling to maintain the $90,000 support zone. Even so, on-chain data suggests the asset may see sustained gains in the coming days. Bitcoin shows signs of market bottom In this case, data shared by Ali Martinez in a November 29 X post shows Bitcoin nearing a key “low-risk” zone based on its Sharpe Ratio, a measure of risk-adjusted returns. Historically, when this ratio dips into the green band, it has coincided with discounted prices and strong accumulation periods for long-term investors .

This is an area that often offers solid opportunities for dip buyers. pic.twitter.com/0XAMkFKrTP — Ali (@ali_charts) November 29, 2025 The latest data indicates a sharp drop in the Sharpe Ratio, mirroring past cycles that preceded major recoveries. Bitcoin’s price has also softened, pulling back from recent highs and approaching levels that typically attract dip buyers. While the indicator doesn’t guarantee a market bottom, its move toward the low-risk zone has often signaled favorable long-term entry points as sentiment cools and risk metrics reset.

While the project is seeing massive institutional interest, with ETF inflows topping $527 million , its price is struggling to break past key resistance around the $144 mark. Now, a new proposal to cut staking rewards is raising questions about its long-term decentralization. GeeFi has set a new benchmark for early-stage momentum after selling 10 million tokens and fully closing Phase 1 in a little over a week . Thousands of investors moved in fast, recognizing the potential behind GeeFi’s advanced, utility-packed DeFi wallet. Phase 2 has already begun with a 20% price uplift , and analysts expect this phase to wrap up rapidly, given the intense demand. Immediately after Phase 3 fills, the price jumps another 20% , meaning every delay costs potential upside. GeeFi’s Clear Path GeeFi offers a solution by focusing on a self-sustaining ecosystem that rewards its users directly. With its non-custodial wallet , you maintain full control over your assets. GeeFi is building a platform where you can earn through clear and tangible methods. Its upcoming staking program, for example, is projected to offer an impressive APR of up to 55% . This provides a dependable source of passive income that isn’t reliant on speculative market trends or institutional sentiment. A Presale Opportunity with Explosive Momentum The excitement around GeeFi is growing rapidly. The project sold all 10 million of its Phase 1 tokens, raising $500,000 in just 12 days . An incredible $320,000 of that was raised in the last week alone, showing a massive acceleration in demand. Now in Phase 2, the GEE token is priced at $0.06 , but the opportunity for huge returns remains. With a listing price of $0.40 already planned, investors who buy now are looking at a guaranteed return of 667% . Analysts are forecasting that GeeFi could become a $2 project. This means a $600 investment today could turn into $20,000 , delivering a remarkable 3,233% ROI . Given the rapid pace of Phase 1, experts predict Phase 3 could begin in just 3 weeks , so the window to get in at this price is closing fast. Your All-in-One Hub for Crypto Management GeeFi is creating an integrated platform to make every part of your crypto experience easier. The GeeFi HUB will serve as a central command center for managing all your digital assets. It will connect directly with the GeeFi DEX , a decentralized exchange designed for fast, secure, and low-cost trading across multiple blockchains. This design directly addresses the common frustrations of high fees and complicated interfaces found on many other platforms. With the GeeFi HUB and DEX, you can manage your portfolio, keep track of your NFTs, and swap tokens without any hassle. It is a full suite of tools built to give you more power and control, making crypto management both direct and affordable. An Ecosystem Built to Reward Its Community At the core of the project is the GeeFi Wallet , which is already available for Android , with an iOS version coming soon. It supports over 14 networks , letting you manage all of your crypto assets in one secure and convenient location. The GeeFi Team has been working on this platform since 2023 , providing consistent updates that demonstrate their commitment to a long-term vision. GeeFi also rewards its community for helping it expand. Through a simple referral program, you can earn a 5% bonus in GEE tokens for every purchase made with your unique link. While Solana’s future depends on unpredictable market forces, GeeFi is building a project with real utility and sharing its success with its supporters from the very beginning. With excitement growing and investors pouring in, the presale is transforming into a race rather than an opportunity. Those who wait too long may find themselves chasing a price that keeps moving higher.

Nearly every top platform reported massive outflows, signaling potential shifts in user behavior and institutional strategies. Analysts note that the total XRP held on exchanges has fallen sharply, suggesting either large-scale withdrawals, migration to self-custody, or internal rebalancing. The total exchange-held XRP dropped to 15.86 billion, a decline of 6.5 billion XRP since February, representing a 29% decrease. Upbit experienced a 6.22 billion XRP outflow, while Binance saw 2.56 billion XRP leave the platform. Bithumb followed with 1.77 billion XRP withdrawn. Other major exchanges, including Uphold, eToro, Bybit, and Bitbank, reported roughly 50% balance drops. These figures suggest that users are increasingly moving assets off exchanges, possibly into personal wallets or cold storage solutions. Meanwhile, a few platforms bucked the trend, Evernorth gained 13.36%, Coincheck saw an influx of 550 million XRP, and OKX reported a striking 10,107% spike, likely due to address reclassification. Conversely, some exchanges faced extreme declines. Coinbase lost 99.97% of its XRP holdings since February, while KuCoin, Paribu, and SwissBorg recorded near-total exits. The widespread reduction in exchange balances highlights a possible reshuffling event that could have long-term implications for XRP liquidity and market dynamics. 21Shares XRP ETF Set to Trade on Monday This liquidity shift coincides with the upcoming launch of the 21Shares U.S. spot XRP ETF, set to trade under the ticker TOXR on Monday. The ETF will track the CME CF XRP-Dollar Reference Rate, allowing investors exposure to XRP’s spot price without holding the cryptocurrency directly. The U.S. market has seen a flurry of XRP ETF activity in recent days, including launches from Grayscale and Franklin Templeton. Early trading of these ETFs shows strong demand, with GXRP and XRPZ capturing $67.36 million and $62.59 million in flows on their first days, respectively. Technical Outlook: Key Levels to Watch Source: X As of press time, XRP’s price rose 0.75% in the last 24 hours, trading at $2.19 , with a 7-day gain of 13.61% and a market cap of $132 billion. According to EGRAG CRYPTO analysis, closing above $2.60 could signal bullish momentum, while surpassing $3.40 would indicate strong upward trends. Conversely, a close below the 21 EMA may mark a bearish reversal. Analysts emphasize monitoring these levels for signs of sustained market strength. Conclusion XRP’s recent exchange outflows, combined with the launch of the 21Shares ETF, indicate a transformative period for liquidity and investor behavior.

This unprecedented surge in digital commerce represents a 9% increase from last year’s $10.8 billion, signaling that Black Friday has firmly established itself as a dominant e-commerce moment. How Did Black Friday Online Spending Reach Record Levels? The numbers tell a compelling story of digital transformation. Between 10am and 2pm on Black Friday, online shoppers were spending an incredible $12.5 million every minute. Adobe Analytics, which tracks more than 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail websites, confirmed this represents a new benchmark for holiday shopping. The data reveals that consumers are increasingly opting to shop from home rather than brave crowded stores, fundamentally changing how Americans approach the biggest shopping day of the year. What Do These Holiday Shopping Trends Reveal About Consumer Behavior? The record-breaking Black Friday performance provides crucial insights into broader holiday shopping patterns. Adobe projects total holiday spending will reach $253.4 billion this year, up from $241.1 billion in 2024. However, the growth story has important nuances: Salesforce tracked $79 billion in global Black Friday spending, with $18 billion coming from the United States Year-over-year increases of 6% globally and 3% in the U.S. Higher prices accounted for much of the growth, with prices up 7% on average Actual order volumes decreased by 1%, suggesting consumers are spending more per item How Is E-commerce Evolving During Peak Shopping Seasons? The e-commerce landscape is undergoing rapid transformation, with Cyber Monday expected to surpass even Black Friday’s impressive numbers. According to Reuters, Adobe projects $14.2 billion in online spending for Cyber Monday, continuing the trend of digital dominance during the holiday season. This represents a significant shift from traditional brick-and-mortar shopping, though the data on in-store traffic presents a mixed picture: Data Source In-Store Traffic Change Key Findings RetailNext Down 3.4% nationwide Overall decline in physical store visits Pass_by Up 1.17% overall Department stores saw 7.9% increase The Rising Impact of AI Shopping on Holiday Commerce Both Adobe and Salesforce report seeing growing AI influence on holiday shopping behavior. Salesforce revealed that between Thanksgiving and Black Friday, AI and AI agents influenced $22 billion in global sales. While the exact definition of “AI influence” remains somewhat unclear, this represents a significant development in how technology is shaping consumer decisions and shopping patterns. The integration of AI into e-commerce platforms is creating more personalized shopping experiences, helping consumers find deals faster and making recommendations based on browsing behavior and purchase history. This technological advancement is likely contributing to the efficiency of online shopping and the record-breaking spending numbers. What Does This Mean for the Future of Retail? The record Black Friday online spending of $11.8 billion signals a permanent shift in consumer behavior. Several key trends are emerging: Digital Dominance: Online shopping continues to capture larger shares of holiday spending Price Sensitivity: Higher prices are driving dollar growth while volume decreases AI Integration: Artificial intelligence is becoming a significant factor in shopping decisions Timing Matters: Peak shopping hours generate massive concentrated spending The transformation of Black Friday from a primarily in-store event to a major e-commerce moment reflects broader changes in retail. As consumers become more comfortable with digital shopping and technology continues to evolve, we can expect these trends to accelerate in coming years. Frequently Asked Questions How does Adobe Analytics track online spending data? Adobe Analytics monitors more than 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail websites, providing comprehensive insights into e-commerce trends and consumer behavior across the digital shopping landscape. What companies provide holiday shopping data beyond Adobe? Salesforce also tracks global shopping trends, reporting $79 billion in worldwide Black Friday spending with detailed analysis of price changes and order volumes across different markets and retail sectors. How is AI influencing holiday shopping according to the data? Salesforce data indicates that AI and AI agents influenced approximately $22 billion in global sales between Thanksgiving and Black Friday, though the specific mechanisms and definitions of AI influence continue to evolve as the technology becomes more integrated into e-commerce platforms. What’s the difference between Black Friday and Cyber Monday projections? While Black Friday set a record at $11.8 billion, Adobe projects Cyber Monday will reach $14.2 billion in online spending, reflecting the continued growth of digital commerce and changing consumer shopping patterns throughout the holiday weekend. How do in-store shopping trends compare to online growth? Data from RetailNext shows a 3.4% decline in nationwide in-store traffic, while Pass_by reports a 1.17% overall increase with department stores seeing a significant 7.9% boost, indicating varied performance across different retail formats and locations.

55115942,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=869944,1764453600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/55115942.jpeg,"The New Crypto Dominating Q4 2025, Only 6% Tokens Under $0.04 Remain",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/the-new-crypto-dominating-q4-2025-only-6-tokens-under-0-04-remain/,"It is being overtaken by a new cryptocurrency in the last quarter of 2025 and the demand is increasing at a faster rate than many had anticipated. As 6% of its existing token issue remains outstanding at less than half a $0.08, investors are scrambling to lay hands on their positions before the next crypto market leap. The pace is picking up day by day and it is prematurely believed that this project can be the best one to purchase currently as more and more interest is generated in the market. Explosive Presale at Mutuum Finance One of the best presales of the year has been by Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . When the presale was opened in early 2025, the token was priced at $0.01. It now costs $0.035, which is a 250% increase in token appreciation. The rise has been gradual and not abrupt as perceived by many traders. The presale occupies 1.82 billion tokens (45.5%) of the total supply of 4B. Over 800 million tokens have already been sold. Mutuum Finance has already raised over $19M and has over 18,200 holders, which makes it one of the most active new cryptocurrency offerings in 2025. Phase 6 is in the final stages, and it is already allocated over 94%, and only a minor percentage of tokens is left at the current price. The high demand rate is one of the reasons why investors seeking the best cryptocurrency to invest today are putting MUTM under their watch. Mutuum Finance and What It Is Building Mutuum Finance is developing a flexible and yield-efficient protocol of lending and borrowing, which is decentralised. The system aims at providing users with greater liquidity control and allowing a safer way of borrowing and more predictable returns. The central concept of the platform is the use of mtTokens, with which users are rewarded when they post assets to the protocol. These tokens increase in value as the borrowers repay interest, which is comparable to the yield bearing receipt of deposits. The design assists in making the interests of the suppliers and the borrowers to match without the use of basic staking rewards. A buy-and-distribute model also helps Long-term value at Mutuum Finance. A part of the protocol revenue is used to buy MUTM on the open market, and MUTM on the open market is redistributed to users that stake mtTokens in the safety module. This provides pressure to purchase continuously and compensate the active users as the platform increases. The issue of security has been a primary interest since the beginning. The project underwent a CertiK audit where the score was 90/100 Token Scan and Halborn Security is looking into lending and borrowing contracts. Having already finalized code, this stage of transparency gives comfort to the early investors and contributes to the development of trust concerning the long-term perspectives of the project. V1 Launch, Whale Activity and Increasing Urgency As indicated in the official account of Mutuum Finance V1 protocol, the release of the protocol is set on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. The initial version will consist of a working liquidity pool, mtTokens, a debt-tracking token, and the liquidation bot. There will be support of ETH and USDT at the launch. The existence of a working protocol in the presence of the token lists enhances the likelihood of the existence of an early exchange visibility, which may become a trigger to more interest and a purchasing triumph. It has been observed that the activities of the whale are on the increase with Phase 6 nearing its end. There are recent significant allocations such as buys of more than $100K which indicate that there is a lot of confidence in this project on its long-term vision. When large investors join in the last phases of a presale, it is usually an indication of active demand. The number of tokens below $0.04 is shrinking at a 6% rate, and there is always a sense of urgency. Investors who seek the best cryptocurrency to invest in at the moment are fast mounting their horses as the countenance at $0.035 narrows by day. As soon as Phase 6 is fully allocated, the following step will increase the entry price, and there will be no likelihood to purchase MUTM lower than $0.04. Supported by a booming presale, robust security bases, plans to launch stablecoins, oracle infrastructure, whales and an almost full Phase 6, Mutuum Finance now applies to Q4 2025. The early investors have only a meager percentage of tokens remaining at 0.035 and the clock is running out on them. The supply will dwindle at any time as long as the demand remains at this rate.

The flagship cryptocurrency is now trading above $90,000, with hopes building for a potential push back toward its all-time high of $126,100. Notably, popular market analyst KillaXBT has flagged a key price zone that could serve as the next target in this relieving market recovery. Related Reading: Bitcoin Must Break Key Supply Clusters To Regain ATH Momentum – Watch These Levels Bitcoin Headed To $95k-$96k, But Price Pullback May Occur First – Analyst In an X post on November 28, KillaXBT shares some compelling insights on Bitcoin’s price condition, highlighting both bullish and bearish tendencies. Following the asset’s gain of 7.22% in the past week, the analyst predicts that market bulls are likely to drive prices to around $95,000-$96,000, which contains strong, heavy illiquidity pockets and several liquidation clusters. For context, these zones are attractive to price because they contain large concentrations of resting orders, making them high-value liquidity targets. Liquidation clusters, in particular, hold groups of leveraged positions that trigger forced buying or selling once the price reaches them, injecting fresh liquidity into the market. However, KillaXBT cautions that this upside move may not occur immediately, noting that the market often delays sweeping major liquidity zones ahead of key macro events. With the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting expected to deliver clarity on potential rate cuts, traders may see continued liquidity building below the yearly open in the near term. According to the analyst, these upper liquidation levels are still likely to be cleared, but the timing could align more closely with next month’s policy announcement rather than the current market cycle. The analyst outlines a potential scenario in which Bitcoin experiences a minor pullback to around $93,000 before retesting $89,200. From there, the asset could move toward the $95,000–$96,000 target, in line with expectations for a potential FOMC rate adjustment. However, KillaXBT also highlights the possibility that Bitcoin may reach these key liquidation zones before the FOMC meeting. In such a scenario, the market could see a rapid surge to $96,000, followed by a sharp drop to around $89,200 due to potential liquidations, before eventually returning to these upper liquidity zones. Following this analysis, KillaXBT is opting for a short position, which he intends to reassess in relation to market trends as the FOMC approaches. Interestingly, the analyst believes the real short-term opportunity only comes after the FOMC’s announcement. Related Reading: Bitcoin STH Loss Transfers Fall 80% From Peak – What Comes Next?

According to the organization, these criminal hubs often lure victims with promises of high-paying overseas jobs before coercing them into compounds where they are forced to carry out schemes ranging from voice phishing and romance scams to investment fraud and cryptocurrency fraud targeting individuals worldwide. While not everyone working in these centres is trafficked, Interpol noted that those held against their will frequently face brutal conditions, including physical violence, torture, sexual exploitation, and rape. Global Crisis The resolution comes amidst growing use of advanced technologies by criminal networks to deceive victims and conceal their operations. As part of a coordinated plan for joint action, Interpol has outlined several measures to strengthen international law enforcement efforts, including real-time intelligence sharing to identify perpetrators and pinpoint locations, multinational joint operations supported by Interpol, targeted action against criminal financing and illicit assets linked to scam networks, and standardized emergency protocols to rescue and repatriate victims alongside expanded support services. Interpol Secretary General Valdecy Urquiza said , “To effectively counter these criminal networks, we must strengthen collaboration, improve information sharing, and move forward with coordinated, decisive action. INTERPOL is committed to supporting the resolution’s implementation and working with member countries to break these operations apart and protect the people who are most at risk.” The resolution also calls for global awareness campaigns directed at vulnerable groups, particularly youth and job seekers. Interpol said the threat has grown sharply, while pointing to its June crime trend update that reveals victims from more than 60 countries have been trafficked into scam centres operating well beyond Southeast Asia. Criminal activities have been found to be increasingly overlapping with drug, firearms, and wildlife trafficking. In 2024, Interpol led its largest-ever global operation against trafficking-driven fraud across 116 countries and territories, which resulted in more than 2,500 arrests, alongside additional regional operations in Africa and Europe. The organization first drew attention to the rise of scam centres in 2022 with a Purple Notice warning of social media recruitment tactics, followed by a 2023 Orange Notice which identified trafficking-fuelled fraud as a serious and imminent threat to public safety. Interpol Targets Big Names in Crypto Crime The resolution emerges as Interpol continues to pursue several high-profile individuals tied to alleged crypto-related crimes around the world. For instance, in 2022, the organization issued a Red Notice for Terraform Labs co-founder and CEO Do Kwon following the collapse of the Terra ecosystem. In July 2024, Hong Kong native and cryptocurrency promoter Wong Ching-kit was added to Interpol’s alert system for his suspected involvement in multiple criminal cases, including a cryptocurrency scam of more than $384,310. And in December 2024, Richard Schueler, better known as Richard Heart, founder of the Hex cryptocurrency, was listed under a Red Notice at the request of Finnish authorities over allegations of tax fraud and assault.

Fresh market data reveals that buying and selling pressure is no longer evenly distributed throughout the day, with the United States emerging as the key source of support. At the same time, other regions struggle to regain a solid footing. US Traders Fuel Bitcoin, Ethereum, And XRP Price Recovery Bitcoin’s market has moved once again as fresh on-chain data shows a clear divide in buying and seeking across global trading hours. A recent shift in US trading activity has had a noticeable impact on the broader crypto market. Ethereum and XRP, which experienced a sharp decline in previous weeks, have begun to stabilize and show mild recovery as Bitcoin strengthens during US hours. Currently, the price of BTC is above $90,000 after crashing below $87,000 earlier in the week. Ethereum has also reclaimed the $3,000 level and is now trading steadily above it. XRP has recorded the most weekly increase between the two, jumping approximately 14% according to CoinMarketCap, with its price presently around $2.18. While these cryptocurrencies have yet to regain all lost ground, renewed buying from US traders has helped ease the downward momentum that dominated in previous weeks. Sharing a new session-based chart from Velo, market analyst Ted Pillows disclosed that the US has reemerged as a net buyer of Bitcoin. At the same time, Asia remains the primary source of selling pressure throughout the year. This regional imbalance has reshaped the latest price movements of Ethereum and XRP, which tend to follow Bitcoin’s upward trajectory . The latest figures from Velo support this view. Velo’s Bitcoin session chart shows that US trading hours, which had been in negative territory earlier in the week, climbed steadily into positive territory from November 24 to date. The blue line representing US hours rose from just above 2% to 3.73% on November 24 before reaching 7.55% by November 26. This reflects a gain of more than 4% over the period, confirming a strong resurgence in demand from US traders. Europe Remains Uneven While Asia Leads Bitcoin Selling European trading hours, highlighted by the purple line, have been more uneven than those of the US. Europe rose to 1.67% on November 24 and briefly pushed higher to 3.31% later that day. This surge comes after the cumulative weekly return fell into negative territory from November 21, and while a slight recovery followed, it still ended the week below the flat line. This suggests that despite weak buying momentum, Europe may no longer be delivering the heavy selling pressure seen earlier. On the other hand, Asia continues to lag behind both regions. Velo’s chart shows that the APAC trading session , represented by the yellow line, started in slightly positive territory around November 20 but turned negative soon after. For most of the week, the regions remained between -5% and -7%. This persistent weakness signals a continuation of the year-long pattern in which Asian hours have been the leading driver of Bitcoin’s sell-side pressure.

The premier cryptocurrency seems to be on a recovery path, returning above the $90,000 mark on Wednesday, November 26. Despite the several calls of the bear market in recent weeks, the crowd has returned with hopes of the BTC bull run resuming. However, a prominent on-chain analyst has come forward with an interesting analysis of the current Bitcoin price outlook. BTC Price To Continue Within $70,000 – $90,000 Zone: Analyst In a November 28 post on the X platform, CryptoOnchain shared an evaluation of Bitcoin’s current price action around the $90,000 level. According to the crypto pundit, recent on-chain data suggests that the market leader is at risk of a rejection at its current price level. Related Reading: Fed To End QT In December: Will Bitcoin Mirror The Massive Price Crash From Last Time? CryptoOnchain highlighted that the Bitcoin price lost a significant support level at $90,000 when it initially fell to around the $80,000 mark a week ago. Now, the price of BTC is looking to make a sustained close above the $90,000 level after bouncing back from the Point of Control (POC) near $82,000. In crypto trading, the point of control (POC) refers to the price level with the highest volume of trading activity within a given period. It basically represents a zone where buyers and sellers are equally matched, leading to the formation of support or resistance. After bouncing from the POC around $82,000, CryptoOnchain said the flagship cryptocurrency has now settled into a “clear” consolidation zone between the $70,000 and $90,000 region. While the Bitcoin price currently sits above $90,000, the analyst noted that the market leader faces potential rejection. This conclusion was drawn from on-chain data, which shows that large amounts of Bitcoin have been flowing into Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume. According to CryptoQuant, the crypto exchange has seen over $2 billion worth of BTC in the past seven days, which could put some downward pressure on the price. Besides the potential selling pressure, there is limited buying power to absorb the extra BTC supply that might hit the open market from sales. CryptoOnchain shared that the net stablecoin inflow on Binance stands at approximately $735 million, which means limited potential demand or buying power. With this “clear supply-demand imbalance,” CryptoOnchain concluded that a rejection from the $90,000 mark and sideways movement within the $70,000 – $90,000 consolidation zone is the likely scenario for the price of BTC. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC sits just above $91,000, reflecting no significant movement in the past day.

55119988,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=870293,1764460793,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/55119988.jpeg,"160 New Yorkers get $12,000 in USDC as Coinbase's crypto‑UBI pilot begins",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/160-new-yorkers-12000-crypto-usdc-coinbase/,"160 people in New York City are now receiving $12,000 each in crypto through a five‑month cash transfer program funded with money that came from Coinbase. The funds did not come directly from the exchange this year. Coinbase donated the money to a nonprofit after shutting down its own philanthropy program two years ago, and that nonprofit is now running the pilot. The payments are going out in USDC, a stablecoin that tracks the U.S. dollar. The goal is simple on paper. Move real money to real people using crypto rails and track what happens. The program started in September and will end in February. Each of the 160 participants began receiving $800 per month in USDC at the start of the pilot. On top of those monthly payments, every participant also received a one‑time $8,000 lump sum in November.When the five months are finished, each person will have collected exactly $12,000. All transfers are delivered digitally through crypto wallets using USDC as the payment rail. New York pilot sends cash as monthly USDC and a large lump sum The cash transfer trial follows the model of guaranteed basic income programs that already exist across the United States and in other countries.These programs send money directly to people with no spending rules attached. The payments go to a selected group, not the entire population. Most guaranteed income programs target households that earn close to the poverty line. This makes them different from universal basic income, where everyone in a city or country would receive payments no matter their income level. The New York crypto pilot changed the usual payment pattern by adding a large upfront payment. Emma Kelsey, the program lead for the New York cash transfer project, told Business Insider that the choice to include a lump sum came from past research. “A lot of the research in our international work and in the US has shown that a lump sum could allow people to invest or do things that might have higher costs, like a security deposit or sign up for an education or training program,” she said. “But, also, it’s something that we’ve heard from participants is a preference.” Kelsey also pointed to a separate program in Georgia called In Her Hands, which is run by GiveDirectly.That project also tested larger upfront payments instead of only sending monthly transfers. “We did a lot of community research and heard from them that this lump sum approach could be more valuable for them versus a standard recurring payment model,” she said. The New York pilot copied that structure by pairing steady monthly USDC with one large payout. GiveDirectly selects South Bronx and East Harlem for crypto payments GiveDirectly chose to run the pilot in New York City for several reasons.According to Kelsey, one factor was support from local politicians for crypto‑based tools.Another factor was the level of need in the target neighborhoods. The 160 participants were selected from the South Bronx and East Harlem, two areas with very low household income levels. “We chose New York, in particular the South Bronx and East Harlem, because there are incredibly low‑income areas,” she said. “There has also been support from politicians in the area around crypto, making it accessible. It seems like a really natural fit where the need was high, but also the ecosystem around crypto had more support than in some other areas.” The decision to use crypto instead of regular bank transfers also sets this pilot apart from most other guaranteed income tests. Kelsey said GiveDirectly wants to see how people react when money arrives through digital wallets instead of bank accounts. “We are really interested to see if people use it differently,” she said. “Do they perceive it differently? Is it more or less useful to them?” Kelsey also said residents in the South Bronx and East Harlem may be more open to using crypto than traditional banking tools.She said some residents already face limits with standard financial services. “We thought it would be a good opportunity to see if this type of payment modality would be viewed favorably,” she said. The pilot will continue sending $800 each month through February, after the November lump sum already landed in wallets.

This happened during a week when the major U.S. stock averages still managed to finish higher, even as November as a whole dragged. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.5% for the month, snapping a seven‑month winning streak, while the S&P 500 and the 30‑stock Dow barely held onto small gains as pressure built across big technology names over high valuations and real questions around when massive AI spending will finally turn into steady profits. Using the CNBC Pro stock screener, analysts filtered for companies inside the S&P 500 that rallied this week while also posting an RSI above 70, and that screen pulled up only a handful of names. Alphabet and Ralph Lauren landed near the front of that group. The metric flags stocks that have run too hard in a short time and may be set for near‑term pullbacks even when broader markets look calm. Alphabet draws buyers as Gemini 3 fuels the latest rally The move in Alphabet came as investors rushed into the stock after growing doubts around OpenAI’s funding model and renewed questions about the strength of ChatGPT after the ChatGPT‑5 release in August failed to impress. Traders focused instead on Gemini 3 and the company’s in‑house Tensor Processing Units, both of which pushed shares sharply higher this week. The stock’s rise over the past year has also been visible on its one‑year performance chart as money continued to rotate into select AI names. Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes addressed the run in a client note on Nov. 24. Ben wrote, “Some investors are petrified that Alphabet will win the AI war due to huge improvements in its Gemini AI model and ongoing benefits from its custom TPU chip.” He added , “Gemini 3 should help the highly profitable API business and arguably vaults GOOGL ahead in agents … the benefits of Gemini 3 are being deployed immediately to help Search within AI Mode, which also helps alleviate concerns in the core business.” The quotes landed as the stock pushed deeper into technically stretched levels. Merck and retail names join the overbought list Merck also landed on the overbought screen with a 14‑day RSI of 80, the highest reading among the group. The drugmaker reported third‑quarter earnings and revenue above expectations in late October, driven by strong demand for its cancer immunotherapy Keytruda. Around the same time, Merck narrowed its full‑year profit outlook after lowering estimated tariff costs and adjusting for other items. On Nov. 14, the company announced plans to acquire Cidara Therapeutics in a nearly $9.2 billion deal to secure access to an experimental flu drug. After the rally, Merck shares climbed more than 21% in November, and analysts now see limited upside. Their consensus price target of $102.43 implies about 2% downside, based on market tracking from LSEG. Ralph Lauren and Las Vegas Sands rounded out the rest of the overbought group. Ralph Lauren’s RSI sits at 71, while Las Vegas Sands stands at 79.8. Ralph Lauren shares jumped 8% this week, lifting the stock to a November gain of roughly 15.5%. The rally followed a strong second‑quarter performance and guidance, which pushed analysts at TD Cowen and Telsey Advisory Group to raise their price targets earlier this month. All of the stocks on the list share the same warning light right now. They posted fast gains in a market already uneasy about stretched prices, slowing momentum in tech, and the long road ahead for turning AI investment into steady cash flows, according to the same market screen that flagged each of them this week.

As the momentum continues to increase and with high development progress already being registered, many traders deem that this token is one of the potential best tokens to buy now before it comes nearer to launching. There are indicators that the period of the greatest growth can be yet to come. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol that is aimed at developing utility. Included in the system is a Peer-to-Contract architecture whereby the users deposit assets and earn mtTokens. These mtTokens are increasing in value in accordance with the interest of the borrowers, which is an APY that is directly dependent on activity in the protocol. Another developing market is Peer to Peer. Depending on how they want to repay the loan, Borrower is given the option of using the variable and stable rates. Variable rates move with the use of the pool, whereas stable rates permit costs that may be predicted. LTV rules ensure safety. Stable assets are able to support higher LTVs, approximately 75% whereas volatile tokens are able to be near 35%t or 40%. In case of a collapse in the collateral, liquidations safeguard the pool by handing liquidators discounted collateral and liquidating risky positions. Holder Development and Increasing Demand Mutuum Finance started its journey at the beginning of 2025 at approximately $0.01. This has been followed by steady purchasing which has paved the way to a price of $0.035, an increment of 250%. The project has raised $19M on the board of investors and has established a number of 18,200 owners. All the stages have been driven by high demand. Phase 6 is currently deep into its allocation, so there is little of the tokens at the current price. Increase in presale activity is a typical indication of good market sentiment as indicated by analysts. The initial launch price of MUTM will be at $0.06, which could place early investors at an advantage to over 500% token appreciation. Mutuum Finance also has close community presence through its 24-hour leaderboard in which the best player wins $500 in MUTM. This will assist in attracting daily inflow and hastens total demand. It is the low price, combined with solid investments and increasing activity that lead many traders to believe that MUTM is one of the potential best cryptocurrencies with the price below $0.05. V1 Launch and Major Audits Based on the official X account of the project, V1 of Mutuum Finance is planned to be released on the Sepolia Testnet in the fourth quarter of 2025. This edition comprises the liquidity pool, the mtToken system, the debt-tracking token and the liquidation bot with ETH and USDT support available as soon as it is usable. It gives Mutuum Finance a great edge over many new DeFi tokens because it has a working product before it launches. One of the strongest areas of the project is security. The CertiK audit of the code was with a 90/100 Token Scan and the final version of the lending and borrowing contracts are in the review with Halborn Security . Such stacks of checks give MUTM some degree of trust that a token at an early stage may not have. Due to these reasons, analysts are confident that MUTM will be increasing amidst a great margin once it attains its launch price of $0.06. Other estimates suggest early goals of between $0.25 and $0.40 based on market volume, platform usage and general DeFi usage. According to many investors, Mutuum Finance is one of the most robust DeFi competitors with a valuation under $0.04, developing lending solutions, robust audits, yield system, layer 2 growth and stablecoin plans. The allocation of Phase 6 is almost complete and the supply is depleting rapidly, which means that the sense of urgency is gaining momentum. To the investors who are seeking the most feasible cryptocurrency to purchase, the chances of purchasing MUTM at $0.035 would not last long.

With a deeper corrective target on the macro frame and a respected support zone in the mid-range, SOL is gearing up for a move that could shape its next major trend. This Wave Completed As Solana Signals A Larger Pullback Elliott Waves Academy has presented a fresh perspective on SOL, focusing on the weekly timeframe. According to the analysis, SOL appears to have completed its upward wave, identified as wave (1)/(A), within a broader bullish structure. This recent break below a key level reinforces the view that a deeper corrective phase may already be underway. Related Reading: Solana Reclaims Crucial Resistance Despite First SOL ETF Outflows – 25% Rally Ahead? Based on the wave count and Fibonacci measurements, the correction is expected to extend toward the $49.26–$32.03 range, which aligns with the 50%–61.8% retracement levels. Should SOL reach this area, a clear corrective pattern paired with a strong bounce would help validate the broader bullish thesis and suggest that buyers are stepping back in with conviction. Price behavior within this zone will be critical in determining the next major swing. If this scenario unfolds as anticipated, a decisive breakout above the key level that was previously broken will act as confirmation for renewed upside momentum. However, a violation of the $8.00 level would invalidate the bullish outlook entirely, signaling a much deeper structural shift. SOL Coils For Impact As Price Compresses Into A Tightening Structure According to a recent update from CryptoPulse, Solana is shaping up for what looks like a textbook technical setup. The current structure is tightening, showing reduced volatility and signaling that a decisive move may be approaching. With SOL consolidating, the chart is beginning to align with a major technical level. Related Reading: Solana Pullback Finds Purpose As Strong Hands Eye Accumulation Below $160 The key zone highlighted is the $133 support level, an area that has previously acted as a reliable reaction point for buyers. Real partnerships, continuous development, and increasing on-chain activity are all reinforcing this technical zone with additional weight. Given this confluence, the strategy becomes clearer: allow price to revisit the $133 region and observe how the market responds. If buyers step in aggressively, forming wicks, bullish engulfing candles, or strong volume spikes, it could signal that the level is holding once again. CryptoPulse emphasizes patience above all. Instead of chasing the market, let the chart come to you. When both fundamentals and technicals point to the same area, it often increases the probability of a strong follow-through. Acting on confirmation rather than prediction is the key to building a solid position in setups like this.

Within this period, the premier cryptocurrency saw a decline to as low as $80,600, marking a more than 10% deviation from the aforementioned support. As the price stands fairly over $90,000, there seems to be a recovery underway. However, a closer monitoring of on-chain activity has revealed that the reality is diametrically opposite to widespread expectation. LTH-STH SOPR Ratio Spikes To 2.63 — What This Means In a recent QuickTake post on CryptoQuant, the on-chain analytics platform Arab Chain reveals a shift within the internal structures of the Bitcoin market. This report revolves around readings obtained from the Binance: BTC SOPR Ratio (LTH – STH) metric, which assesses and compares the profit-taking behavior of Bitcoin’s long-term holders (LTH) to that of its short-term holders (STH). Arab Chain highlights that the LTH-STH ratio recently saw a spike to 2.63, a reading which marks the highest level put in since August. Notably, this spike in the SOPR index comes amid Bitcoin’s rise to around $90,000, signaling an underlying spike in LTH sell-off despite this modest rebound. This notion is confirmed by the Long-Term Holder SOPR itself, which reportedly to 2.58, indicating that members of Bitcoin’s most influential trend setters are currently exiting the market in deep profits. Normally, the sharp move in the LTH–STH ratio, especially one that causes the establishment of a multi-month high, usually represents a period of selling pressure that typically precedes price corrections. However, the current situation steers slightly away from this standard. ‘Profit-Taking Phase May Go On For Several Weeks’ — Analyst As the LTH SOPR reads 2.58, the STH SOPR stands at levels around the 0.98 mark, suggesting that the flagship cryptocurrency’s short-term holders are selling off their holdings either at break-even or even with some losses incurred. The market imbalance, therefore, reveals itself in that “long-term investors are capturing substantial profits and capitalizing on previous rallies to sell off, while short-term investors are unable to achieve clear gains.” Arab Chain explains that if the Bitcoin price decline should intensify, there could be additional acceleration dedicated to its fall down south. Historically, widening gaps between LTH and STH SOPR have often preceded defined movements in BTC’s market cycle. This behavior, according to Arab Chain, reveals that the market is likely entering a typical “cash-for-profit” phase, where its major holders sell off their holdings. Seeing as a surge of an almost comparable magnitude last took place in August, the firm conjectures that the market could see a major price reset, as opposed to the minor price fluctuation investors may be anticipating. As of this writing, Bitcoin is worth about $90,652, recording no significant movement over the past day.",Bitcoin|Arab Chain|bitcoin|Bitcoin LTH SOPR|Bitcoin STH SOPR|Long-Term Holders|LTH-STH Ratio,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-30 01:00:45

By 2028, $TRUMP could reach a maximum price of $28.45. In 2031, $TRUMP will range between $34.14 to $46.22. The Official Trump coin ($TRUMP) was launched on January 17, 2025, just three days before the inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump. Following President Trump’s “newfound” crypto inclination, the $TRUMP meme coin was birthed. My NEW Official Trump Meme is HERE! It’s time to celebrate everything we stand for: WINNING!

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 18, 2025 The coin has a total supply of 1 Billion tokens, with an initial 200 million tokens unlocked at launch. Subsequent unlocks are scheduled over the next three (3) years. $Trump token unlock roadmap Trump’s “advocacy” for digital assets reforms boosted interest in $TRUMP in the first few days, driving it to an all-time high (ATH) of $75.35. Several other meme tokens, like the Official MELANIA coin, also rode the momentum. Despite the initial surge, Official Trump’s value has plunged to lower levels amidst shifting market sentiment and uproar around the legitimacy of a “President-owned Meme coin.” The price performance of Official Trump is down over 85% from its all-time high, raising questions among investors, such as: How much will Trump coin be worth? Can Trump coin reach $100? This piece explores the Official Trump price predictions for 2025-2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Official Trump Token $TRUMP Price $6.05 Market Capitalization $1.208B Trading Volume $172.68M Circulating Supply 199.99M TRUMP All-time High $75.35 (January 19, 2025) All-time Low $1.21 (January 18, 2025) 24-h High $6.11 24-h Low $6.01 Official Trump technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 9.49% (High) 14-Day RSI 37.97 (Neutral) 50-Day SMA $6.88 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 28(Fear) Green Days 9/30 (30%) 200-Day SMA $9.31 Official Trump Coin ($TRUMP) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown Bearish momentum is fading for $TRUMP, but no solid reversal signals have formed yet. Official TRUMP coin’s price is stabilizing above $6, suggesting sellers are losing strength. Official Trump coin 1-day price analysis The daily chart for November 30 shows TRUMP trading at $6.05, sitting just above the lower Bollinger band at $5.60, where the price has been sliding but is now flattening. This compression signals selling pressure losing strength, though buyers have not yet reclaimed the mid-band at $6.68, which remains a strong resistance to watch. TRUMP/USDT 1-day price chart by TradingView Momentum remains weak, with the MACD sitting deep in bearish territory and still diverging lower, although the histogram is starting to lighten, an early hint that downside momentum is slowing rather than accelerating. The RSI at 38 shows oversold-leaning conditions but without any bullish divergence yet, meaning it’s too early to declare a trend reversal, though price stability above $5.60 would improve the odds. Official Trump 4-hour price analysis The 4-hour chart shows TRUMP hovering at $6.04, repeatedly testing but holding the $6.00 psychological level. The Alligator indicator remains fully open in a downward feed, confirming the downtrend is still active. However, the lines are beginning to converge slightly, indicating the bearish wave may be tiring. TRUMP/USDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The RSI on the 4-hour sits at 36, similar to the daily reading, suggesting sellers are losing strength, but buyers have not yet stepped in with conviction. OBV remains depressed, meaning volume inflows are still weak and any bounce will likely be gradual rather than explosive. $TRUMP technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $6.96 SELL SMA 5 $6.67 SELL SMA 10 $6.62 SELL SMA 21 $7.10 SELL SMA 50 $6.88 SELL SMA 100 $7.61 SELL SMA 200 $9.31 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $6.85 SELL EMA 5 $7.03 SELL EMA 10 $7.39 SELL EMA 21 $7.90 SELL EMA 50 $8.58 SELL EMA 100 $9.39 SELL EMA 200 $10.60 SELL What to expect from $TRUMP price analysis TRUMP is more likely to range and attempt a slow rebound from the $5.60–$6.00 zone, but until it breaks $6.15 with strength, the broader downtrend remains intact. The next 24–72 hours should focus on whether buyers defend $5.60, which will dictate whether consolidation continues or the trend weakens further. Is Official Trump a good investment? Meme coins like $TRUMP are volatile and driven by hype, not fundamentals. While they can offer big rewards, they come with high risk and uncertainty. If you’re making an investment decision on TRUMP coin, do your own research carefully and prepare for price swings. Why is $TRUMP down? $TRUMP plunged hard post‑launch, now rattling in a tight $5–8 consolidation over the past month as traders wait for new hype or a breakdown. With most tokens controlled by insiders, sentiment remains weak, and only fresh utility or momentum could revitalize it. Official Trump coin price history by Coingecko Will Official Trump reach $50 soon? $TRUMP coin already saw this price point in January; increased investor interest could result in a quick resurgence. Will Official Trump reach $100? Having touched a peak price of $75.35 and a market cap of $15 billion in its first few weeks, the $100 milestone might not be much of a hurdle to scale, provided $TRUMP can recapture the momentum it had in its earlier days. Will $TRUMP reach $1000? For $TRUMP to hit $1,000, its market cap would need to rise over 100× into the hundreds of billions, or even trillions if locked supply is released. With dilution risks, weak fundamentals, regulation, and competition, the chance of this happening in the next few years is very low.” Does Official Trump have a good long-term future? The long-term future of the Official Trump Coin is uncertain. While it has gained attention, peaked at $75, and generated significant revenue, its success will depend on crypto market trends, investor confidence, and how it navigates regulatory challenges. Recent news/opinion on $TRUMP Melania ‘meme coin’ value bottoms out as Trump brands collapse: WSJ Wall Street Journal reports that the market has “soured” on Trump brands. Reporter Jack Pitcher wrote, “Digital ‘meme coins’ named for Trump and first lady Melania Trump are down 86% and 99% since inauguration day, respectively.

Official TRUMP historic price sentiment Official Trump coin price history by Coingecko Official Trump coin was launched on January 17, 2025, just a few days before the US presidential inauguration. Briefly after launch, the euphoria of DJT’s inauguration drove the $TRUMP coin to an all-time high of $75.35. As expected, market players took profit, and the Official Trump coin lost momentum, hitting a low of $18.75 by February 1, a massive 75% drop in price. Further price declines followed, but $TRUMP showed some resilience, reaching a high of $24 by mid-February, albeit short-lived. The bears recaptured the market in the following months, and the Official Trump coin settled at lower prices – about $7 to $11 between March and April. $TRUMP hit a high of $16.28 by April end, but has since maintained an average price of about $10.5. Official Trump coin traded between $8.07 and $10.13 in August. In September, TRUMP maintained a trading range of $7.37-$9.46, and in October, it traded between $7.65-$8.02.

According to reports , the incident forced the plant to shut down its generation and data center operations, temporarily stopping both company-run rigs and machines operating for clients. Electrical Switchgear Failure Reported Based on reports, an electrical switchgear malfunction on November 23, 2025 started the fire and triggered automatic safety systems that de-energized the facility. The Dresden plant, which has about 106 megawatts of generation capacity, was taken offline immediately to prevent further damage. Company filings and local updates said none of the hosted mining machines — including those co-located for NYDIG — suffered material damage during the event. A fire just halted operations at Greenidge Generation’s #Bitcoin mining site — a major facility co-hosting rigs for NYDIG. No hardware lost, but the incident reveals a hidden risk: physical infrastructure fragility in the mining stack. #BTC #MiningOps #CryptoInfra #NYBitcoin pic.twitter.com/35sMu2x3le — ₿itBlitz (@BitBlitz) November 28, 2025 Emergency crews responded and the fire was contained, but the outage left the site idle while technicians inspected equipment and repaired infrastructure. Impact On Mining Operations And Clients Reports have disclosed that the shutdown means lost hashing time for every miner at the site. For co-hosting customers like NYDIG, downtime translates to missed block rewards until the machines can be safely powered up again. Mining firms typically earn revenue only while rigs run, so even a short stoppage can cut into weekly receipts. Industry observers noted that the Dresden plant is a major part of Greenidge’s US footprint, so the pause affects a sizable share of the company’s output. Bitcoin Mining Economics Under Pressure Mining profitability is under strain across the board as network difficulty climbs and competition increases. Based on recent market data, margins are tighter than in prior cycles, making every hour of offline time more costly. Investigation And Recovery Timetable According to the company, crews are working to restore service and Greenidge expects a return to normal operations within a few weeks. That timetable is provisional and tied to the results of inspections and replacement of damaged switchgear. Regulators and insurers will likely review the incident, and an internal investigation is expected to clarify the cause of the failure and whether any maintenance gaps contributed. Stakeholders will watch closely for confirmed repair schedules and any disclosures about lost bitcoin production or costs tied to the outage. Co-hosts will also monitor whether the incident prompts changes to safety practices or contract terms for hosted rigs.

Following this move, the Central Asian nation joins the expanding list of countries opting for regulation in the crypto industry against an outright ban. Turkmenistan Explores Crypto Amid Economy Diversification On Friday, Reuters reported that President Serdar Berdymukhamedov of Turkmenistan signed a new law that will permit registration of crypto exchanges and crypto mining companies from January 1, 2026. Notably, this development appears to represent part of the state government’s recent efforts to diversify its economy beyond gas exports, following Turkmenistan’s status as the nation with fourth fourth-largest gas reserves. Reuters also confirmed the government’s motive behind its new regulation, stating an intent to drive investment and speed up digitalization. While there are no official data on the level of crypto ownership in Turkmenistan, citizens’ ability to purchase digital assets using credit/debit cards, as well as the existence of Bitcoin ATMs, indicate significant traction requiring legalization. In particular, local Kyrgyzstan media states the new regulations signed by President Berdymukhamedov assert the legal status of cryptocurrencies as civil assets but with no economic power to serve as currency or means of payment. Furthermore, all licensed crypto exchanges are mandated to ensure the protection of users’ data and deposits. Meanwhile, mining operations can be performed by both individuals and local businesses following approval and registration with the recognized state authority. Other aspects of Turkmenistan’s crypto regime cover specific definitions of terms, and operations center around offering, transfer, issuance, and storage. Crypto Adoption Surges In Central Asia Beyond Turkmenistan, other nations in Central Asia, including Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, are also ramping up crypto regulatory efforts to create an enabling environment for digital assets adoption. Notably, Uzbekistan has completed legal preparations to formally adopt stablecoins for payments in 2026, while also permitting the trading of tokenized stocks on licensed exchanges. Meanwhile, Bitcoinist reported that Kazakhstan has recently allocated $500 million – $1 billion for a national reserve fund with a potential launch slated for 2026. In addition, the former soviet state also introduced a national stablecoin, KZTx, in collaboration with the world’s biggest exchange, Binance. Taken together, these crypto-friendly moves show that Central Asian nations are doubling down on blockchain and digital assets as an emerging pillar of the global financial sector. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the total crypto market cap is now valued at $3.05 trillion following a modest rebound in the last week after an extended correction that began in early October.",Crypto News|crypto exchanges|crypto mining|Crypto Regulations|Kazakhstan|Reuters|Turkmenistan|Uzbekistan,EN,0,0,ASIA|EXCHANGE|MINING|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-30 05:00:40

Here’s the Latest,https://timestabloid.com/institutions-using-coinbase-to-stack-xrp-into-cold-storage-heres-the-latest/,"Xaif (@Xaif_Crypto) posted a striking message on X showing a transaction of 11.64 million XRP sent to Coinbase. The image he shared detailed a successful transfer from a private account to Coinbase’s wallet. His post appeared as activity around XRP increased following the launch of new spot ETFs . Xaif tied the activity to previous comments made by industry analyst Chad Steingraber. He argued that movements of this size into Coinbase should not be treated as random. With Coinbase acting as the main custodian for asset managers, he sees the transfer as institutions placing XRP into cold storage for ETFs. As @ChadSteingraber said when you see 11.64M $XRP getting moved into Coinbase, it’s no coincidence. With Coinbase as the primary custodian for asset managers, this is institutions stacking XRP straight into cold storage. https://t.co/O7qOgQzFP4 pic.twitter.com/RtIW3YOhxN — Xaif Crypto| (@Xaif_Crypto) November 28, 2025 ETF Growth Changes XRP Custody ETFs have gained significant attention over the past few weeks. These products allow asset managers to gain exposure through regulated markets rather than direct exchange trading. Since their launch, these products have seen major inflows , with investors rapidly joining the XRP market. The launch of XRP ETFs changed how XRP moves through the market. Funds must hold the asset with a regulated custodian. Coinbase fills that role for most major asset managers in the U.S. That setup explains why large amounts of XRP are now flowing into Coinbase wallets. These transfers do not signal selling pressure. They point to custody. Tokens sent in for ETF backing move into cold storage. Chad Steingraber had earlier explained this pattern. He said large Coinbase inflows often reflect institutional positioning rather than normal exchange use. Xaif’s post echoed that view and added clear transaction data as support. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Impact of Cold Storage Once XRP enters cold storage , it leaves the active trading pool. These tokens are not placed on order books. They are held for long periods to back ETF shares. This process has already reduced the amount of XRP available on exchanges. Public data shows exchange balances are declining . That trend has slowed supply while ETF demand grows. The 11.64 million XRP transfer Xaif shared fits neatly into this picture. It reflects how ETFs change both custody and circulation. Each new fund purchase removes more XRP from liquid markets. The transfer Xaif highlighted does not stand alone. Large token movements have appeared in recent weeks. Together, they show a system forming behind the ETFs. Asset managers do not trade in and out daily. They accumulate and hold. As these products expand, more XRP will shift into long-term storage. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Although it was stopped there, it now stands close to $0.26, which actually means that its monthly performance is quite promising compared to the rest of the market, as almost all of its digital asset competitors have posted double-digit losses. But the question now arises of what’s next, and we decided to get in touch with ChatGPT and Perplexity to check their views on the matter for PI in December. Is ChatGPT Bullish? Despite the recent positive PI performance, in which the asset gained over 50% since its all-time low on October 10, its overall trend since it saw the light of day in February this year has been quite painful, and ChatGPT reminded that investors should also pay attention to that 90% drop. Nevertheless, it believes that the recent stabilization above $0.23 is the first good sign as it suggests that “sellers may finally be losing control.” It noted that the $0.21-$0.23 support is crucial for PI and could determine its overall performance in December. In terms of actual price predictions, ChatGPT said the token could reach up to $0.35 over the next several weeks. To do so, it would need alignment across several factors, such as better overall market conditions and continued updates to the Pi Network ecosystem, including the latest improvements in the Pi App Studio. In contrast, if the market heads for another correction and PI fails to break the $0.27 resistance, then it could fulfill the bear-case scenario, which envisions another drop below $0.20 and possibly challenging the ATL of just over $0.172. It actually noted that this is the least likely scenario as PI will now enter December “in a stronger position than it’s been in months,” before it added: “The token shows stability, improving structure, and relative strength compared to the broader market. If the ecosystem continues to expand — and if macro conditions don’t deteriorate — PI could deliver one of its better months.” Does Perplexity Agree? ChatGPT’s competitor wasn’t as hopeful for PI. It began its prediction by noting that analysts are “bearish short-term” for December, with “models forecasting averages of $0.198 and ranges of $0.194-$0.202, implying potential 20-25% drops from current levels.” It said that some technical indicators, such as the RSI going above 65, suggest PI might be overbought and due for a correction. It also noted that the overall crypto market is not out of the woods yet, which could trigger another industry-wide correction that can impact Pi Network’s native token as well. In conclusion, Perplexity warned investors to be wary about PI’s performance in the next month. Although there’s a chance for “flat-to-modest gains,” it added that “bearish forecasts suggest a cautious year-end around $0.20.” The post How High Can Pi Network’s (PI) Price Go in December? 2 AIs Speculate With Big Numbers appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|Pi Network (PI),EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-11-30 05:15:55

This session did not follow that pattern. Within 2 hours and 30 minutes of the U.S. market opening, XRP-based ETFs posted notable trading activity. Crypto commentator Xaif (@Xaif_Crypto) shared the figures in a post on X, highlighting the massive trading volume.

Canary Capital led the group with $4.67 million. Franklin Templeton followed closely at $4.24 million. Bitwise ranked third at $4.09 million. Grayscale recorded $1.64 million, while Rex Osprey posted $1.40 million. Canary Capital has been a notable force in the ETF market since its launch. It hit a record volume of $58 million on its launch day. However, Franklin Templeton and Bitwise are also making notable waves in the market. The tight spread at the top shows that all three funds are trading within a narrow band. That pattern showed no single issuer had locked up liquidity. Xaif summed up the action with a short remark. “Institutional money is rotating fast,” he wrote. He added that “the XRP ETF race is only getting louder.” What to Expect from ETFs Xaif’s data focused strictly on what had already traded. Another market participant added a forward-looking note. Chad Steingraber, who had previously analyzed the market’s performance, predicted that the funds could reach $50 million before the halfway point of the trading session. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 At the start of the week, these funds closed with a total volume of over $85 million . That value excluded the Rex Osprey ETF, and the current pace suggests it could surpass that volume before the end of the current session. Expansion Still Ahead These five ETFs represent only the first wave. Several issuers continue to prepare additional XRP-related products. Some filings target different fee structures. Others aim at alternative custody or liquidity arrangements. Some experts have suggested that up to 12 XRP ETFs are ready to launch . As more products reach the market, volume will likely spread further before consolidating again. The early session numbers show one thing clearly. XRP ETFs have entered an active phase.

Zhao touched upon the importance of investor psychology in his post on his social media account. “It may be an unpopular opinion, but the best strategy is to sell during periods of maximum greed and buy during periods of maximum fear,” Zhao said, reminding that opportunities arise, especially during periods when the market enters panic mode. After Bitcoin retreated to $81,000, market sentiment deteriorated sharply. With Bitcoin trading at $90,710, the Cryptocurrency Fear & Greed Index clearly reflects the deterioration in investor sentiment. As of today, the index sits at 20, falling into the “fear” category. Related News: Strategy CEO Responds: Will the Company Sell Bitcoin? What Will Happen to the BTC Price in the Future? While this level is the same as yesterday's, it represents a significant improvement compared to last week. The index had fallen to the “extreme fear” zone last week, falling as low as 10. The index, which was again in the “fear” zone at 39 a month ago, reveals that investor sentiment has been stuck in negative territory for a long time. The picture is even more striking when comparing year-to-year: the index peaked at 84 in November 2024, at the “extreme greed” level, and then fell to the 10 level in November 2025, reaching its annual low, demonstrating the drastic shift in market sentiment. CZ's message reiterates the importance of these emotional swings to investment strategies, and current market conditions support his words. Despite Bitcoin's gain of over 7% in the past week, the overall market remains subdued, prompting investors to exercise caution. *This is not investment advice.

However, a monumental shift is now underway as Apple Pay has integrated into leading crypto platforms, and getting a major upgrade is becoming as seamless and intuitive as any other digital transaction. This integration removes one of the biggest barriers to entry by replacing traditional transactions. Why Apple’s Entry Signals A Turning Point For Global Crypto Payments Apple Pay is now directly integrated with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. A crypto site, CryptosRus, has revealed on X that Apple users can now purchase BTC and other cryptocurrencies directly within Trust Wallet using Apple Pay . This integration will make buying crypto as easy as buying Apps from the App Store, dramatically lowering friction for newcomers with no more clunky bank transfers , complex onboarding forms, and steep learning curves. With a few simple taps via Apple Pay, the crypto will be in your Trust Wallet. In short, Apple is helping to replace fear and friction with just tap-and-own simplicity. This Apple Pay and crypto is the kind that will seamlessly onramp. Bitcoin and crypto adoption are sharply gaining traction globally. In a surprising turn for one of the world’s most tightly controlled economies, Turkmenistan has officially legalized Bitcoin and broader cryptocurrency trading. CryptosRus stated that President Serdar Berdimuhamedov has signed a new Sweeping bill that sets the stage for a fully regulated crypto market to begin in 2026. The new law establishes a dedicated state Commission that will oversee licensing, Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) protocols, cold-storage rules, mining registration, and even the power to halt or require refunds for token issuances. According to CryptoRus, this is a sign that even the most controlled states are being pushed into crypto adoption as the global regulation accelerates. Bitcoin Decentralized Rails More Resilient Than TradFi Hardware? An author and ideologist, Shanaka Anslem Perera, pointed out that the day $13.4 billion in Bitcoin options expired, the traditional financial system nearly collapsed. At the crucial hour of 03:00 GMT, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) froze, a cooling failure originating from a single data center. The failure led to 90% of global derivatives trading being halted. Meanwhile, a larger sum of $15 billion in crypto options was settled on time, with each block confirmed and every trade seamlessly executed. The machines that price the world stopped working because they were overheated, and the decentralized alternative rails ran exactly as designed. “This isn’t a coincidence, it’s a stress test , and only one system passed the test,” Shanaka noted.",Bitcoin|AML|Anti-Money Laundering|apple|Apple Pay|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Chicago Mercantile Exchange|CME|CryptoRus|know-your-customer|KYC|Shanaka Anslem Perera,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-30 06:30:06

Analysts monitoring the early trading activity suggest that sustained ETF accumulation could meaningfully reduce the quantity of XRP available to retail markets, potentially influencing the token’s valuation. This development has raised questions about how such a scenario might affect investors holding moderate amounts of the digital asset, particularly those with 1,000 to 5,000 XRP. Rising ETF Demand and Early Accumulation Trends Since their debut, XRP ETFs have attracted substantial inflows. Within the first eleven trading days, the four available products collectively gained approximately $666 million in net purchases. This figure has already surpassed the inflows recorded by the six Solana ETFs, which reached $618 million after twenty-three days. The pace of accumulation has prompted speculation that ETF issuers could, at some point, absorb a significant share of XRP held on centralized exchanges. This possibility has been highlighted by commentators who argue that persistent inflows could tighten supply conditions over time. Estimating How Long Exchange Reserves Could Last Digital Perspectives founder Brad Kimes recently reviewed exchange liquidity estimates using Grok, which assessed XRP tokens that are accessible for active trading. According to the model’s response, major platforms such as Binance, Upbit, Bithumb, and OKX collectively hold between 5 and 6 billion XRP in liquid reserves as of late November 2025. The report also indicated that Binance controls the largest share, approximately 2.71 billion XRP. This figure has declined by roughly 400 million tokens between early October and mid-November, reflecting ongoing withdrawals and ETF-driven demand. Grok further observed that exchanges lost about 73 million XRP in a single day during recent market activity, suggesting continued outflows and reduced selling pressure. Overall, the estimated 5 to 6 billion XRP in liquid supply represents around 9% to 11% of the circulating 56 billion tokens. To evaluate how quickly ETFs could remove this supply, the model reviewed inflows from Nov. 25 to 27. During this period, issuers received an average of $26 million per day. At an XRP price of $2.20, this equates to roughly 11.8 million XRP purchased daily. Based on this rate, Grok estimated that clearing 5 billion XRP would take about 422 days, while removing 6 billion XRP would require approximately 506 days, placing the timeline between 14 and 17 months. Projected Price Ranges Under a Supply Reduction Scenario To understand the potential price impact , Google Gemini was consulted. The model emphasized that price responses to supply constraints tend to accelerate as available liquidity decreases. Gemini referenced a Bank of America analysis from 2021 showing that each $1 entering Bitcoin during constrained periods contributed significantly more to total market value. Using comparable assumptions, Gemini proposed several potential XRP price ranges if ETF accumulation removes most of the remaining liquid supply. The initial range falls between $8 and $13, assuming steady momentum. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A deeper supply reduction could support valuations between $20 and $25, particularly if the broader market revalues major assets and Ethereum approaches a higher market capitalization. Gemini also outlined a more extreme case, where limited liquidity forces ETF issuers to purchase at progressively higher prices, which could push XRP above $50. Gemini suggested that such an increase could unfold across three stages within seventeen months: An initial accumulation period lifting XRP from $2.20 to around $5, a middle phase driving the price toward $15, and a final period characterized by accelerated increases into the $20 to $50+ region. Current data indicates that 596,029 wallets contain between 1,000 and 5,000 XRP, making this one of the largest holder groups. Presently , 1,000 XRP is worth $2,210, and 5,000 XRP is worth around $11,050. If XRP reaches $50, 1,000 XRP would rise to $50,000, while 5,000 XRP would expand to $250,000. Even at a $20 price level, 1,000 XRP would be worth $20,000, and 5,000 XRP would be valued at $100,000. These estimates illustrate the scale of gains for holders if ETF accumulation significantly reduces supply. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

(95% will be EXIT LIQUIDITY) RT for updates!… pic.twitter.com/vVgarmipVz — JD (@jaydee_757) November 28, 2025 A Crucial Message to Traders JD kept his message direct. He said he expects one last move before a sharp correction. He also warned that most traders will not react fast enough and said, “95% will be EXIT LIQUIDITY .” His statement shows his belief that market participants often refuse to sell early and then face the downside. The chart he shared supports that view. It shows XRP on the monthly timeframe with an ascending triangle that formed over several years. The price moved inside a clear rising trendline and tested a horizontal resistance multiple times. The Technical Picture In late 2024, XRP experienced a sharp rise that sent it above the ascending triangle. This breakout gave way to another crucial technical pattern. JD displayed RSI data at the bottom of the chart. The RSI formed a lower low while the price formed a higher low. He marked this as hidden bullish divergence . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This condition appears when momentum weakens during a pullback, but the price holds its trend. Traders view that as a sign of continuation rather than trend exhaustion. JD pointed to this to support his expectation for one more upward move. Where XRP Could Be Heading Based on the chart, the structure remains intact as long as XRP stays above the rising trendline. The hidden bullish divergence gives the setup more strength. If buyers defend this level, XRP can reach the projected breakout zone before momentum fades. That aligns with JD’s expectation of a final push. JD has previously predicted a 95% crash after XRP’s next bullish move. In his post, the analyst describes the coming move as a rug pull crash. Traders now need to watch the asset’s movement around the rising trendline. This, combined with the RSI behavior, will determine whether XRP completes the move JD anticipates and starts the decline he has predicted.

On the question of what type of investors might be behind this increase, on-chain data suggests that it’s all about whales now. Whales Buying, Retail Sidelines? Data shared by Crypto Rover, which compares the whale vs retail data, indicates that the larger cohort of investors has been a lot more active lately. In fact, their behavior has been linked to the overall price movements of the underlying asset in the past several weeks, including a selling spree in early October when BTC peaked above $126,000 and dumped by $15,000 in days. Now, though, the data points to significant accumulation efforts once bitcoin slumped by $25,000 in just over a week to under $81,000.

ETF Investors Are Back What could be even more bullish on BTC’s upcoming price actions is the recent return of investors buying through the spot Bitcoin ETFs . The financial vehicles were in a ton of trouble for the past month, with a substantial exodus from all funds, especially BlackRock’s IBIT. The past week was the first in the green since early October, albeit in a rather modest manner. After the $151 million in net withdrawals on Monday, investors poured in $128.7 million on Tuesday, $21.1 million on Wednesday, and $71.4 million on Friday (Thursday was an official Holiday in the US). Consequently, the week ended with a minor net inflow of $70.2 million, which is still a lot better than the $1.2 billion taken out during the previous trading week.

Today, experts recognize that the same pattern appears to be emerging in Mutuum Finance, an innovative cryptocurrency that has hit the markets with much better fundamentals than ADA offered in the first year when it initially broke out, and with an actual use case in the DeFi space, including lending and interest-bearing tokens, and an impending release of testnet v1, among other things. Mutuum Finance , at $0.035, and gaining pace in its presale, and boasting now over 18,250 early adopters, finds itself on the path leading to the same success factor in the crypto markets that ADA enjoyed in 2020–2021. For investors seeking the best crypto to buy, MUTM offers a tangible utility and growth potential beyond legacy altcoins. Cardano Attempts a Short-Term Rebound as Buyers Hold Key Support Cardano (ADA) is still stabilizing above the latest low, making way for a short-term bounce. There could still be room in the ongoing bounce to reach the $0.45–$0.48 equal legs area, where past bounce attempts have indicated the likelihood of sellers re-emerging. As much as the ongoing relief rally on ADA denotes improvement in the short term, the ADA price still has much work to do in order to change the medium-term outlook. While ADA traders are watching the pivotal price levels, some investors are assessing the Mutuum Finance, which is now recognized as the top crypto in emerging DeFi markets. Mutuum Finance Presale Attracts Huge Interest Mutuum Finance, has quickly become the best crypto to buy in 2025. The presale has managed to gather over 18,250 distinct individuals, garnering over $19.02 million. The current price for Phase 6 tokens is $0.035. As the presale phases advance into Phase 7, the price of the tokens will rise by an added 20% to $0.04. The uniqueness in Mutuum Finance compared to other altcoins lies in their high-level adoption, making it a top crypto for early-stage DeFi investors. Growth Catalyst 1: Dual Lending Framework Mutuum Finance, will accelerate the adoption of the platform through their dual approach in lending. The Peer-to-Contract platform pools large assets like USDT and SOL through properly verified and secured smart contracts. The interest rate varies according to the use rate. Using an example, when the user lends $15,000, they receive the mtUSDT token, and an approximate 15% annual interest rate, resulting in $2,250 annually. The borrowers can pledge their assets, like $2,000 in ADA asset, in exchange for $1,500 in USDT liquidity. The Stability Factor and liquidation conditions in the protocol guarantee the solvency and optimal use of funds. Conversely, high volatility assets like Dogecoin are covered using the Peer-to-Peer lending module. In this scenario, the traders negotiate the terms themselves and are conscious that they are dealing with high risks in the hopes of acquiring higher returns. In the short term, traders will be able to provide, borrow, and stake their funds in specially designated pools in order to generate fixed returns. This environment makes MUTM the best crypto to invest in, specifically designed for traders who actively use the DeFi ecosystem. Growth Catalyst 2: Fee-to-Buyback Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will use platform fees on lending, borrowing, and staking as incentives to trigger a systematic process of buying back their tokens, MUTM. The purchased MUTM tokens will then be given out to those who stake their tokens in the network, effectively engendering increased activity. By correlating real on-chain activity with tangible rewards, the system encourages people to stay involved in the long run rather than speculating on the future value. This makes MUTM a top crypto for those seeking sustained utility and growth. Protocol Launch Strategy & Exchange Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) aims to debut in the Sepolia Testnet by the end of 2025, and the supported assets in the beginning are ETH and USDT, specifically used in lending, borrowing, and providing collateral. The initial version will help in enabling basic functionalities like the liquid pools, mtToken, and debt token, and liquidator bot. The testnet functionality provides an earlier opportunity to interact with the platform, and this shall enable users who join the testing process to become well-versed with the platform before the launch of the mainnet. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has rapidly increased in popularity among crypto projects in 2025, with the ongoing Phase 6 presale now over 95% sold, having raised over $19.02 million from over 18,250 members. Mutuum Finance has a dual lending model, fee-to-buyback engine, and plans to launch the Sepolia testnet. Get involved today and claim your spot in the Mutuum Finance Presale, where you can invest in the best crypto to buy and secure one of the most promising top crypto projects before the next market rally.

As one of the Asia-Pacific region’s most historic golf tournaments, the Championship provides a high-impact platform for KuCoin to engage partners, clients, and the broader community while elevating its brand presence alongside Australian golf icon and KuCoin Global Brand Ambassador Adam Scott. As part of the collaboration, KuCoin hosted an invite-only VIP hospitality experience on November 28 in a private suite overlooking the 17th hole. Designed as a strategic engagement platform rather than a traditional client event, the gathering brought together industry leaders, institutional partners, and regulatory-aligned stakeholders to deepen dialogue on building a trusted and compliant digital asset ecosystem in Australia. Set against the backdrop of KuCoin’s AUSTRAC registration and ongoing commitment to strengthening local oversight, the experience featured a premium environment with curated food, beverages, and interactive brand showcases that highlighted KuCoin’s security, transparency, and governance frameworks. The event served as an important touchpoint for advancing responsible industry collaboration and reinforcing KuCoin’s long-term commitment to compliant growth and user protection in the Australian market. Tika LUM, Head of Global Institutional Business Development at KuCoin, delivered opening remarks, covering the strategic upgrade of KuCoin Institutional and showcasing its core competencies anchored in trusted compliance, secure infrastructure, and continuous innovation—all aimed at empowering clients with advanced services, deep market intelligence, and exclusive VIP experiences. The highlight of the afternoon was an exclusive meet-and-greet with Adam Scott, which offered attendees a memorable opportunity to connect with KuCoin Global Brand Ambassador while watching tournament play from the suite’s outdoor balcony. Adam joined a quick Q&A session with Tika, sharing his experiences with professional golf training methods and technical skills, as well as the shared values between himself and KuCoin—values that mirror KuCoin’s commitment to building a secure, resilient, and innovative trading infrastructure. The activation fostered meaningful interaction with KuCoin leadership and strengthened local relationships, underscoring the company’s focus on trust, innovation, and user empowerment in the crypto industry. “This partnership with the Australian PGA Championship was a tremendous success, blending the precision and tradition of golf with KuCoin’s forward-thinking approach to cryptocurrency,” said Tika LUM, Head of Global Institutional Business Development at KuCoin. “It was an honor to host our partners and clients in such an iconic setting, and Adam Scott’s involvement truly elevated the experience.” Building on this momentum, KuCoin continues to deepen its investment in Australia. The company recently secured registration as a Digital Currency Exchange (DCE) provider with AUSTRAC, introducing new compliance requirements and improving fiat access for Australian users. In addition, KuCoin has established a new office in Sydney’s CBD and appointed James Pinch as its Australian Managing Director to lead local operations across compliance, operations, cybersecurity, and product development. These developments reflect KuCoin’s long-term commitment to building a secure, user-centric digital asset ecosystem in Australia and supporting the country’s evolving Web3 landscape. About KuCoin Founded in 2017, KuCoin is a leading global crypto platform built on trust, serving over 40 million users across 200+ countries and regions.

In its post, Binance argued that when the trading volumes of seven major crypto exchanges were examined, direct flows from illicit wallets were at extremely low levels, and that Binance, despite having much higher volumes, had the lowest exposure in the industry. However, according to Chainalysis, the picture isn't that simple. The company stated in a statement that Binance's analysis only calculated direct illicit flows, excluding critical categories such as ransomware, hacked funds, and indirect transfers through intermediate wallets. The statement included the following: “For example, if an illicit wallet first sends funds to a personal wallet and then to Binance, this will not show up in the analysis.” Chainalysis noted that these “wallet chain” methods are widely used by criminals, but can often be traced with the right analytics tools. According to the company's data, $2.2 billion in crypto assets stolen through hacks last year alone reached $1.7 billion. Binance updated its blog post on November 19 following criticism, stating that the analysis was created by the company's own team using Chainalysis and TRM Labs datasets, and that only direct exposure was taken into account in the calculation. Chainalysis's warning comes as Binance has recently been trying to signal stricter regulatory compliance. In 2023, the company paid $4.3 billion in fines for violating anti-money laundering rules, conducting unauthorized money transfers, and evading sanctions. Then-CEO Changpeng Zhao was sentenced to four months in prison but received a presidential pardon in October. Related News: Altcoins with the Most Buybacks in the Last 30 Days Revealed TRM Labs, another analytics firm cited by Binance, also issued a critical statement on the matter. The company's global policy director, Ari Redbord, stated that the 0.018% rate cited by Binance was a “snapshot” of Binance's exposure in June 2025, limited in scope, and only addressed direct exposure. Redbord noted that this figure was not taken from TRM's publicly available reports, but rather from a dataset provided exclusively to Binance: This number did not come from a publicly available TRM report. It was taken from a dataset provided exclusively to Binance. Binance has full discretion in interpreting and framing it. *This is not investment advice.

By press time, the asset was valued at $2.20, having gained about 0.8% in the past 24 hours, while on the weekly timeline, the asset is up almost 9%. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold XRP price on Christmas Day To determine how the asset might trade on Christmas 2025, Finbold consulted OpenAI’s artificial intelligence model, ChatGPT , which cited several factors likely to influence the asset’s price. According to ChatGPT, one of the key factors influencing XRP’s price is the resolution of its legal dispute with the SEC. With regulatory uncertainty removed, institutional investors are more likely to enter, supporting a higher baseline price for XRP. At the same time, the launch of XRP investment vehicles like ETFs and ETPs has also played a role, though early flows have been modest. These products offer increased structural demand, and as they attract more capital, they could support future price gains. Additionally, active treasury and SPAC buying programs aim to raise over $1 billion to purchase XRP on the open market. If these initiatives begin executing buybacks in December, they could provide steady upward pressure on the price. The model also pointed to broader market conditions that also impact XRP. While the crypto market faced weakness in November 2025, a potential rebound in December, especially if the U.S. The Federal Reserve signals a rate cut, could boost investor sentiment and drive XRP’s price higher. XRP price prediction By considering these factors, ChatGPT predicts that XRP will be valued at approximately $3.10 on December 25, with an expected range between $2.40 and $4.50. The most likely price will sit between $2.60 and $3.60. If these factors align positively, XRP could push past $3.50, with the possibility of reaching as high as $4.50. On the other hand, if macro conditions remain weak or delays occur in ETF or SPAC activity, the price could fall below $2.20. XRP price prediction for December 25.

The price has stayed steady on the weekly chart while many indicators have cooled off. This has created an unusual mix of stability and low momentum. Charting Guy (@ChartingGuy), a technical analyst on X, shared his view of this setup and explained why he still sees strength in the current structure. His post focused on support, the behavior of the RSI, and what the pattern signals for XRP. $XRP is still NOT bearish in the slightest building support on prior cycle high as well as top of golden pocket the chart where people show you monthly RSI losing steam.. why didn’t they show you all that in January 2025 when RSI topped?

He pointed to price action on the weekly chart and said XRP is building support on a prior cycle high. He added that it also sits on the top of the golden pocket. These levels often act as strong support zones in trending markets. Also, they help show whether buyers remain active. The chart he shared places XRP above the 0.786 Fibonacci level. Its price has tapped this region several times without breaking below it. This zone used to be a major resistance . Now it serves as support. That shift can play a key role in market structure. Charting Guy’s view is that XRP still respects this structure and continues to move in a stable range. RSI Slide Through 2025 Charting Guy questioned why some users now point to the monthly RSI. He asked why analysts did not do this in early 2025 when it peaked. He said the indicator lost momentum throughout 2025, even as XRP stayed in the same price band. While some experts believe the RSI indicates a bullish resurgence , the analyst’s pattern shows a long momentum reset without a price drop. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This pattern often shows up when a market slows down to reset. The RSI can fall for months while the price remains stable. This is a signal of easing selling pressure. It also shows that buyers still control the range. Reaccumulation Structure and Outlook Charting Guy called the setup a “very textbook reaccumulation signal.” Momentum cooled, but the price held its range and stayed above key Fibonacci levels. XRP defends support. This shows that buyers continue to step in at these levels. XRP remains stable despite weak momentum readings through 2025. Charting Guy noted that the structure has not broken, and buyers continue to support the range. If XRP holds these levels, the pattern may create room for a stronger move when momentum returns .

With the last month of the year just around the corner, we decided to focus on the third-largest non-stablecoin cryptocurrency and asked some of the most popular AIs about their take on what December holds for XRP. What’s Next (ChatGPT Edition)? ChatGPT outlined XRP’s difficult past few months, especially since its all-time high marked in mid-July. By October, the asset had lost all of its yearly momentum and dumped below $2 during the first market-wide crash. The second, which took place in the middle of November, drove it south hard once again to roughly $1.80. Although the cross-border token has rebounded to around $2.20 as of now, it’s still slightly in the red on a YTD scale, which is quite interesting and perhaps unexpected given the overall bullish year. Aside from the ATH, Ripple saw the conclusion of the prolonged battle against the US SEC, and several spot XRP ETFs were launched in the country. OpenAI’s solution noted that the first positive sign for the token is the fact that it quickly reclaimed the $2.00 level after its latest correction. It remains “the most important line to protect heading into December” as a monthly close above it “keeps the long-term trend intact.” ChatGPT highlighted the following factors that can reignite XRP’s rally in the next month: strong ETF inflows, overall market stabilization or more profound recovery, and renewed whale accumulation – something that has been lacking for weeks. Its bull case envisions a price surge to $2.85, while its bear scenario predicts another slip below $2.00 and a December bottom of around $1.80. “December has the potential to be better than October and November, but XRP remains in a fragile position. If the broader market stabilizes, XRP could see a gradual rebound toward the mid-$2 range. However, without a strong catalyst, a full trend reversal seems unlikely before 2026,” – the AI chatbot concluded. XRP Through the Eyes of Perplexity and Grok Perplexity was slightly more bullish. Although it mentioned essentially the same calalysts that can drive another XRP rally, its best-case scenario forecasts a price surge beyond $3.00 and up to $3.40, which would be just inches below the July peak. Even its bearish prediction was higher than ChatGPT’s, as it doesn’t see a drop below $2.00 in December. Grok, on the other hand, believes such a decline might take place if the US Federal Reserve fails to lower the key interest rates or some other geopolitical tension caps XRP’s recent progress. Declining volume and whales realizing profits or capitulating could also contribute to another possible correction that can drive the asset toward the November low of $1.80. Nevertheless, both AIs said they don’t expect fireworks in the last month of the year, predicting moves of up somewhere between 5% and 20% tops.

55139182,https://cryptonews.com/?p=457920,1764492054,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/55139182.jpeg,Housing Crisis Pushes Young Americans Into Crypto Gambles: Study,https://cryptonews.com/news/housing-crisis-pushes-young-americans-into-crypto-gambles-study/,"A new study warns that a growing share of young Americans is turning to cryptocurrency not as an ideological choice, but as a financial gamble driven by despair over housing costs. Key Takeaways: Young Americans are turning to crypto out of financial desperation as housing becomes increasingly unaffordable. Researchers say “discouraged renters” replace saving with high-risk investing once homeownership feels impossible. Over time, this shift traps many in near-zero wealth while hopeful homeowners continue to build assets. The report argues that soaring home prices have reshaped how an entire generation thinks about money, risk and opportunity. US Homeownership Slips Out of Reach, Pushing Youth Toward Risky Bets Researchers found that the median US house price-to-income ratio has risen so sharply since the 1980s that today’s young adults would need nearly two extra years of income to afford the same home their parents could. As the possibility of owning a home fades, financial behavior shifts just as dramatically. Instead of saving for a down payment, many turn to volatile assets that offer a chance at a sudden leap in wealth. “Crypto becomes a substitute for the American Dream,” the authors write, describing digital assets as vehicles for high-risk, high-reward betting when conventional goals feel unreachable. Rather than reflecting faith in decentralization or distrust of banks, crypto participation is increasingly a coping strategy for a broken path to stability. The research identifies a tipping point the authors call “discouraged renters.” Once people conclude homeownership is no longer realistic, their financial habits change in lasting ways. Compared with homeowners of similar net worth, discouraged renters rack up about 10% more in credit card spending and are far more likely to disengage from long-term career ambition. The US housing bubble popped in 2007-08, causing a massive financial crisis. So what did the US do after? It inflated another housing bubble, which is even bigger now. Because the US economy is a financialized house of cards built on asset price bubbles. https://t.co/Fr54cJmTk9 pic.twitter.com/JLHPzPozTE — Ben Norton (@BenjaminNorton) November 30, 2025 The study links this mindset to the rising phenomenon of “quiet quitting,” where workers remain employed but emotionally checked out. Wealth levels also change how people interact with crypto. Renters holding between $50,000 and $300,000 in assets show the highest participation, falling into what the report describes as a no-man’s-land: too creditworthy to give up, yet too poor to buy property. Below $50,000, investment almost disappears, not for lack of interest, but for lack of cash. Crypto, the report notes, becomes a “last-chance lever,” a way to try to beat a system that no longer feels fair. Welfare programs soften the blow of failure, encouraging moonshot risk-taking with limited downside. However, the long-term effects are bleak. Over time, discouraged renters sink into what the study calls a near-zero wealth trap, while those who hold onto the hope of homeownership continue building capital. Global Housing Crisis Pushes Youth From Saving Into Crypto Speculation Young people in South Korea and Japan express similar disengagement under the weight of housing inflation, and both countries have fast-growing crypto communities. The pattern, researchers conclude, is global. When shelter becomes unattainable, speculation replaces saving. In March, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) revealed that it is exploring the potential use of blockchain and stablecoins to improve certain operational functions. Officials also debated a pilot program where a HUD grantee would receive payments via stablecoin, with the initiative first being tested in a single department before broader implementation.

During this time, the market’s largest altcoin gained by 7.22%, providing a much-needed relief after an extended correction that dominated the majority of the last two months. As price stabilizes, crypto analytics platform XWIN Research Japan shares a forward-looking assessment of Ethereum’s outlook, especially considering developments in the futures market. Related Reading: 320 Ether On The Move: Bhutan Ramps Up Its Staking Game Ethereum Bulls Buy The Dip After Weak Position Exits Amid the widespread correction of the crypto market in Q4 2025, Ethereum’s prices crashed from $4,700 to as low as $2,900, representing a 38% price decline. XWIN Research Japan reports this price fall coincided with certain relevant developments in the futures market. In particular, Ethereum’s open interest across all exchanges dropped from $21 billion to around $17 billion in late November, as overleveraged long positions were closed down, forcing traders to open new positions with moderate leverage size. Meanwhile, funding rates stayed positive but declined to around 0.002, meaning that the dominant bullish sentiment from mid-2025 greatly reduced. Looking at on-chain data, the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) is at 1.27, while Binance data shows it to be around 1.0, both values indicating Ethereum is in a neutral to fair value zone, suggesting a period of stability before the next major trend emerges. Meanwhile, the recent market recovery kick-started after ETH retested the realized price of whale addresses, indicating that large market players are bolstering their holdings. XWIN Research Japan supports this theory, noting that Ethereum Treasury BitMine has boosted its market holdings to 3.63 million ETH. Additionally, a BlackRock client recently acquired tens of millions of dollars’ worth of ETH, further reinforcing the strength of current market demand. However, despite this robust market demand, ETH Spot ETF net outflows for November hit $1.42 billion, indicating there is significant selling pressure in the market. Related Reading: Ethereum Fusaka Will Be ‘The Most Bullish Upgrade’ Ever, Pundit Claims Ethereum Market Outlook At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $3,003, reflecting a 0.22% loss in the past day. Despite its gains in the last week, the altcoin is still down by 22.34% over the last month, suggesting the majority of short-term holders are in losses. XWIN Research Japan explains that although the overleveraged position has been cleared out with market whales now ramping up their holding, Ethereum remains in a “bottom-building phase”. Therefore, investors should still anticipate a “choppy, sell-on-rally” price action in the short term. The analysts predict a major trend reversal with time as the current price area becomes increasingly attractive to investors for massive accumulation opportunities.

Many investors still focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum, yet activity around XRP now rises at a faster pace. XRP has seen a notable surge in attention from institutions in recent weeks with the launch of multiple spot XRP ETFs . Cointelegraph recently highlighted this trend in a post. It drew attention to ETF filings, rising institutional demand, legal clarity, and strong market infrastructure. These factors have positioned XRP ahead of other altcoins, giving it a strong foundation for growth. LATEST: Spot XRP ETF filings are surging as legal clarity, institutional demand and strong market infrastructure put $XRP ahead of other altcoins. pic.twitter.com/rBTQrEDdfn — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) November 28, 2025 Legal Clarity Supports New Filings Legal clarity has strengthened XRP’s base for regulated products. The road to legal clarity began with the July 2023 ruling that determined that XRP is not a security. Many institutions avoided the asset before this decision, but it rebuilt confidence in XRP. As a result, firms began engaging more with the asset. Most ETF filings emerged long before the legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ended in August . These institutions now see a clear path for XRP. The legal clarity also reduces the fear that a future ruling will block products that follow the asset. That shift encourages managers to design ETFs that match the demand for structured exposure. Investors respond to this with more confidence because the ruling removed a major source of doubt. Improved Market Structure Helps Adoption XRP’s ecosystem has grown more stable. Trading venues offer high liquidity and faster settlement, which lets managers plan products with fewer risks. Institutional capital is also rising , as investors want assets that can support large trades without delays. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP can handle quick transfers and heavy volume. This gives ETF issuers key data on market depth, custody procedures, and execution quality. These features matter to firms that want products ready for long-term use. XRP’s Leadership Role Many crypto issuers still face legal uncertainty, strict custody demands, and weak liquidity. These limits slow their progress while XRP benefits from clearer rules and stronger market activity. As regulators approve more XRP ETFs , regulated inflows could lift liquidity and improve access. ETF use may also support new strategies built on familiar structures. Advancement with XRP could guide how firms assess future products as they review liquidity, legal clarity, and market systems. XRP is now in a position that shapes expectations for upcoming ETF decisions across the market. It also gives XRP a leadership role among altcoins.

First, there’s Cardano with ADA, still in the focus among traders because of institutional buying and the small on-chain activity, potentially steady and slow on the rise. Next, there’s Dogecoin with DOGE, the forever meme-coin sensation, still in the limelight among those who like quick flashes in the collection, old-school hype now intermingled with the latest crypto trends. And then, there’s Mutuum Finance with the $0.035 new crypto coin called MUTM, the latest upstart on the rapid rise in the presale ranks, locking in the spot among the leading contenders in the crypto market. MUTM has already earned a reputation as the best crypto to invest in, thanks to its dual-lending protocol and practical DeFi use cases. Cardano Is Stuck in the Downtrend While Oversold Conditions Suggest an Upcoming Pullback Cardano (ADA) keeps encountering selling pressures since it broke the major $0.5097 support level, categorized earlier as a double-bottom support, keeping ADA in a major downtrend. The moment the momentum and RSI indices hit the oversold region, there could still be a relief rally in the near term, provided there are sufficient buyers. The technical charts reflect a falling wedge formation on the verge of convergence, hence ADA could test the $0.5097 support levels in the coming days, provided the bears hold on. In a world where the typical altcoins have numerous barriers in the markets, investors now find themselves gravitating slowly toward some emerging sectors. Catching attention in the process, is Mutuum Finance (MUTM), the new crypto coin gathering momentum. Dogecoin Displays Initial Strength Following Crucial Support Test Dogecoin (DOGE) has just escaped the falling channel, and the first signs of bullish momentum emerge after retesting the critical support at $0.1475. Analysts explain that provided the price is maintained above the pullback area, DOGE price may target $0.1652, $0.1749, and $0.1933 in the following days, and a breach below $0.1395 would be a sign the scenario is wrong. While DOGE prepares to possibly make some gains, traders are progressively opting for other available choices in the cryptocurrency market that boast great adoption and real use, triggering a growing interest in Mutuum Finance (MUTM), widely regarded as the best crypto to invest in 2025. The Presale of Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance is quickly growing in the DeFi space as the presale soars in Phase 6. The cost of the MUTM tokens is at $0.035, and this provides the last chance for investors before the cost rises by 20% in Phase 7, where the price becomes $0.04. Mutuum Finance has proven itself as the best crypto to invest in, following the rapid progress of its presale. The pre-sale has attracted the participation of over 18,250 investors globally, raising over $19.02 million, indicating great interest in the project across the globe. With its emphasis on transparency, innovative solutions, and sustainable development, MUTM has quickly become the leading choice among investors looking for a stable and high-growth prospect. The project is being recognized as a new crypto coin with tangible DeFi functionality. With the trend in the world markets shifting into a fresh bullish phase, early-stage DeFi investors remain attracted to the interesting niche and use case offered by MUTM. Tokenomics Designed for Real Utility Mutuum Finance sets itself apart because it has utility-oriented tokenomics, and the primary goal here is practical use rather than trading. Each transaction on the platform helps fuel the need for the token itself, so there’s a snowball effect. The platform has a dual lending system. There are Peer-to-Contract (P2C) collective markets, where the traded assets include ETH and stablecoins, and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) contracts that deal with riskier and less liquid coins. The combination of the two systems enables the protocol to be scalable and stable. All loans are fully over-collateralized and subject to the most stringent LTV ratios, and the interest rates can either be fixed or variable, and the choice lies with the borrower. For instance, when a borrower puts in $1,000 worth of ETH using an LTV of 75%, they can borrow a stable-coin loan up to $750. The APY accrues interest and acts as a motivation factor and indicator in ensuring the stability of the protocol. Driving Adoption through Passive Yield and Market Integration The uniqueness about Mutuum Finance is the concept of mtTokens, through which users are able to receive tokens in exchange when they provide funds to the platform. In conventional deposit systems, the earning on the deposit would only come when the deposit was withdrawn. With mtTokens, there is the ability to earn interest in real time. The system also has a buy and distribute functionality, where a percentage of the fees from the protocol goes into the repurchase and distribution of the MUTM token. The token, in turn, gets distributed throughout the ecosystem, ensuring constant buying force and an immediate link between the platform and the token. In this regard, the purpose and high potential offered by the cryptocurrency, link it with real functionality. Phase 6 Presale has over 95% sold at $0.035, reflecting $19.02 million in sales to 18,250+ investors. With its dual lending functionality, reward-generating mtToken, and high usability, Mutuum Finance is the best crypto to invest in the early investor space. Join the official presale to secure the new crypto coin before Phase 7 starts at $0.04.

In line with Bitcoin’s price recovery, these investment funds also ended a bleeding month of losses on a moderately positive note. Bitcoin Spot ETFs Begin Recovery From Red November According to the ETF tracking site, SoSoValue , Bitcoin Spot ETFs registered a net inflow of $70.05 million in the last week of November, to provide relief to a rather draining month. Notably, this reported figure represents the first positive netflow in four weeks, stretching since the last week of October. In analyzing individual ETF performance, BlackRock’s IBIT, valued at $51.55 per share, was largely unaffected by Bitcoin’s recovery, resulting in net outflows of $137.01 million. However, its cumulative net inflow still stands at $62.57 billion, retaining its status as the undisputed market leader. Other ETFs that also remained under bearish influence include Bitwise’s BITB and VanEck’s HODL, with aggregate outflows of $18.10 million and $36.95 million, respectively. On the other hand, the majority of the positive momentum came from Fidelity’s FBTC, which registered net inflows valued at around $230.44 million. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s duo GBTC and BTC, alongside Ark Invest’s ARKB, recorded a combined $31.65 million in net deposits. Other funds such as Invesco’s BTCO, Valkyrie’s BRRR, Franklin Templeton’s EZBC, WisdomTree’s BTCW, and Hashdex’s DEFI recorded no significant netflow. Following this recent modest recovery, the Bitcoin spot ETFs closed November with total net outflows of $3.48 billion. At the time of writing, the cumulative total net inflow for these investment funds stands at $57.71 billion, while total net assets are valued at $119.39 billion, representing 6.56% of the Bitcoin market cap. Ethereum ETFs Not Excluded From Recovery Party According to SoSoValue, the Ethereum Spot ETFs also experienced a market rebound following three consecutive weeks of outflows. Over the last week, these products attracted net deposits of $312.62 million to bring the cumulative total net inflows to $12.94 billion. BlackRock’s ETHA and Fidelity’s FETH accounted for the majority of this positive netflow with net deposits of $257.18 million and $45.3 million, respectively. The Ethereum Spot ETFs now boast of total net assets of $19.14 billion, representing 5.19% of ETH’s market cap. At press time, Ethereum continues to trade at $2,991 after a minor 1.64% decline in the past day. Meanwhile, Bitcoin remains in consolidation around $90,840.",ETF|bitcoin|Bitcoin Spot ETFs|BlackRock IBIT|Ethereum|Ethereum Spot ETFs|Fidelity FBTC|Sosovalue,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-30 09:30:22

Indeed, IBIT’s returns have soared despite persistent turbulence in the broader Bitcoin ( BTC ) market. At the close of the last session, IBIT was trading at $51.55, reflecting a 106.45% gain from its launch price. This means the ETF has more than doubled since hitting the market in early 2024. IBIT ETF all-time price chart. Source: Google Finance For early investors , the returns are impressive. In this case, a $100 investment at launch, when the ETF traded around $24, would now be worth approximately $206.45. Notably, IBIT’s performance has closely mirrored Bitcoin’s broader momentum but has also benefited from strong institutional adoption. IBITs’ success BlackRock’s expanding crypto strategy, supported by consistent inflows earlier this year, has helped the ETF cement its role as a gateway for traditional investors seeking exposure to digital assets. Indeed, the success of IBIT has had a direct impact on the world’s largest investment manager. To this end, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETFs have quickly emerged as a top revenue source, surprising many given the firm manages over 1,400 ETFs and $13.4 trillion in assets. The US-listed spot Bitcoin ETF has amassed $70 billion in assets in just 341 days, generating an estimated $245 million in annual fees. At the same time, IBIT now holds more than 3% of Bitcoin’s total supply, while BlackRock’s Strategic Income Opportunities Portfolio has boosted its stake in the ETF by 14%, signaling confidence in continued growth.

The statement came from Cristiano Castro, Business Development Director at BlackRock Brazil. This data is noteworthy considering that BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, manages more than 1,400 ETFs and has total assets exceeding $13.4 trillion. Speaking to Brazilian media at the Blockchain Conference in São Paulo, Castro described the growth of Bitcoin ETFs as a “big surprise.” He said allocations to the company's BTC ETFs, including US-based IBIT and Brazil's IBIT39, are approaching nearly $100 billion. “We were optimistic at launch, but we didn't expect this level of growth,” he said. Launched in January 2024, the US spot Bitcoin ETF IBIT reached $70 billion in assets in just 341 days, becoming the fastest ETF in history to surpass this threshold. According to SoSoValue data, the fund's current net assets are $70.7 billion. Related News: Altcoins with the Most Buybacks in the Last 30 Days Revealed In its first year, net inflows exceeded $52 billion, surpassing all ETFs launched in the last decade. IBIT also generated approximately $245 million in annual trading fee revenue as of October 2025. BlackRock's global distribution network and institutional demand following regulatory approval for spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US are cited as key drivers of IBIT's rapid rise. The fund currently holds over 3% of the Bitcoin supply. Following IBIT, the company has also launched various BTC-related products in various countries. Castro also addressed the recent outflows from Bitcoin funds, stating that this volatility was natural. He noted that individual investors react more quickly to price drops, saying, “ETFs are highly liquid and powerful instruments. They were created to manage flows.” *This is not investment advice.

Key Takeaways: Hester Peirce says crypto self-custody is a basic freedom and people should not be forced to rely on intermediaries to hold their assets. She argues that financial privacy should be the default and not treated as evidence of wrongdoing. Her comments come as crypto legislation is delayed and ETFs pull some investors away from self-custody. Speaking on The Rollup podcast , Peirce described herself as a “freedom maximalist” and argued that people should not be forced to rely on intermediaries to control their assets. “Of course people can hold their own assets,” she said, questioning why that principle should even be controversial in a country founded on personal liberty. SEC’s Peirce Says Financial Privacy Should Be the Default Peirce also took aim at what she described as a cultural shift toward treating financial privacy as a red flag. Instead, she said, privacy should be the default, not a sign of wrongdoing. “If you want to keep your transactions private, the assumption shouldn’t be that you’re doing something illegal,” she said. “It should be the opposite.” Her remarks arrive as uncertainty continues around US crypto legislation. According to Senator Tim Scott, the Digital Asset Market Structure Clarity Act, a bill that addresses self-custody, anti-money laundering rules and the classification of digital assets, has been delayed until 2026 .

Peirce’s comments also come at a time when self-custody itself faces competition from Wall Street products. Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have made crypto easier to access for traditional investors, drawing some users away from holding coins directly in private wallets. Self-Custodied Bitcoin Falls for First Time in 15 Years Dr. Martin Hiesboeck, head of research at Uphold, said the industry is seeing the “first decline in self-custodied Bitcoin in 15 years,” as investors shift into ETFs for tax advantages and convenience. The introduction of in-kind redemptions earlier this year allows ETF holders to swap crypto for shares without triggering a taxable event, a benefit that directly competes with personal wallets. The real reason for all the whale movements out of self-custody is simple: taxes. We are witnessing the first decline in self-custodied Bitcoin in 15 years.

He claimed that ETFs offer a convenient alternative, reducing the complexities and risks associated with holding private wallet keys. One of the key reasons behind PlanB’s decision is the security challenge of managing private keys. “Not having to hassle with keys gives me peace of mind,” he stated. The announcement sparked backlash from purists who see centralized custody as a betrayal of Bitcoin’s founding principles.

Key Takeaways: Santiment says low stablecoin yields show the crypto market is not overheated and Ether could test the $3,200 level. Yield data between 3.9% and 4.5% suggests leverage remains muted, reducing the risk of a near-term market top. Technical signals and $312.6M in Ether ETF inflows point to returning confidence after a sharp recent decline. In a report published Saturday , the firm said muted stablecoin yields point to room for further price gains, with Ether potentially revisiting the key $3,200 level. “Currently, yields are low, around 4%. This indicates the market has not reached a major top and could still push higher,” Santiment said, noting that Ether was trading near $3,001 at the time of the report. That target implies an upside of nearly 7% from recent prices around $2,990, based on CoinMarketCap data. Low Stablecoin Yields Signal Crypto Market Isn’t Overheated Santiment tracks yields from major crypto lending protocols, where interest rates often reflect the amount of leverage flowing into the market. According to the firm, stablecoin returns are sitting between 3.9% and 4.5%, a range that suggests borrowing demand remains subdued. Historically, spikes in yields have coincided with speculative excess and trend reversals, making today’s comparatively low levels a sign that risk-taking is still measured. The outlook follows a difficult month for Ether, which slid more than 21% over the past 30 days as part of a broader digital asset selloff. The downturn accelerated after a steep $19 billion liquidation event on Oct. 10, which was compounded by renewed trade uncertainty following US President Donald Trump’s announcement of sweeping tariffs on Chinese imports. https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1994468121982148872?s=20 Technical indicators are also starting to lean constructive. Crypto analyst Matthew Hyland said the ETH-BTC weekly chart is approaching a “bullish ribbon flip” for the first time since mid-2020, a signal that in past cycles has marked the start of extended outperformance against Bitcoin. Flows into exchange-traded products are adding to the shift in tone. Spot Ether ETFs reversed course this week, drawing $312.6 million in net inflows after three weeks of sustained withdrawals, suggesting fresh interest from institutional buyers. Santiment Improves as Sell-Off Eases Sentiment across the market is improving as well. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , which spent 18 days in “extreme fear” in November, recently climbed back into the “fear” zone, hinting that panic-driven selling may be easing. Seasonal patterns may also come into play. December has delivered an average return of nearly 7% for Ether since 2013, according to CoinGlass. Still, with both October and November underperforming typical trends this year, traders remain cautious about leaning too heavily on historical playbooks alone. As reported, ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood has forecasted that the liquidity squeeze hitting crypto and AI markets will reverse within weeks , driven by three Federal Reserve policy shifts expected before year-end. Her firm continues aggressively buying crypto equities during the downturn, deploying over $93 million in a single day this week across beaten-down digital asset stocks.

According to RBC , National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) Chairman Timur Suleimenov announced the initiative would draw from the bank’s foreign exchange reserves rather than the country’s sovereign wealth fund, while cautioning that recent crypto market volatility requires a measured approach before committing capital. The announcement comes as Bitcoin has declined 17% since early November, dropping from $110,000 to $81,000 and wiping $500 billion from total crypto market capitalization. Suleimenov told reporters the bank would “ let the dust settle ” before making investment decisions. He emphasized the difficulty of achieving profitability amid the sharp downturn. National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) Chairman Timur Suleimenov. | Source: Kazinform International News Agency Central Bank Adopts Cautious Stance on Digital Asset Exposure The NBK has already established an investment portfolio containing high-tech stocks and financial instruments linked to digital assets within its gold and foreign exchange reserves. Despite having frameworks in place, Suleimenov stressed the regulator would not rush deployment until favorable opportunities emerge. “ Until good investment opportunities emerge, we won’t rush these decisions, ” Suleimenov said at a November 28 briefing. The chairman had previously told Bloomberg in early November that Kazakhstan planned to create a national crypto fund worth up to $1 billion , clarifying the bank would invest “ cautiously ” through exchange-traded funds and crypto company stocks rather than direct token holdings. This measured approach contrasts with the broader ambitions articulated by President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, who directed the creation of a state-backed crypto reserve fund through the National Bank’s Investment Corporation. The president called for accumulating strategic reserves of “ promising assets ” and announced up to $1 billion in funding for technological growth programs spanning high-tech and fintech sectors. Kazakhstan Builds Multi-Layered Crypto Infrastructure The central bank’s investment plans build on Kazakhstan’s rapidly expanding digital asset ecosystem, which launched its first national crypto reserve in September through the Alem Crypto Fund. Established by the Ministry of Artificial Intelligence and Digital Development and managed by Qazaqstan Venture Group, the fund selected BNB as its initial holding through a strategic partnership with Binance Kazakhstan. Deputy Prime Minister Zhaslan Madiyev described the fund as designed to become “ a reliable instrument for major investors and a key foundation for digital state reserves. “ TLDR: Kazakhstan buys #BNB Kazakhstan ""national"" crypto reserve – Alem Crypto Fund – buys #BNB for long-term holding. https://t.co/ZbLNbuLvpG (Photo from 2022, new photo coming soon…) pic.twitter.com/2aoz33e328 — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) September 29, 2025 BNB currently has a market capitalization exceeding $120 billion and serves as the native cryptocurrency of BNB Chain for processing transactions, paying network fees, and participating in governance. Kazakhstan approved stablecoin payments for regulatory fees in September during Astana Finance Days, with the Astana Financial Services Authority establishing a framework allowing participants to settle fees in U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins through licensed Digital Asset Service Providers. The country also launched Central Asia’s first spot Bitcoin ETF in August, with the physically-backed Fonte Bitcoin ETF trading on the Astana International Exchange, using BitGo Trust for cold storage. Enforcement Actions Target Illegal Operations Amid Expansion While advancing institutional crypto adoption, Kazakhstan has intensified crackdowns on unlicensed operations, shutting down 130 illegal crypto exchanges in October and seizing $16.7 million in virtual assets suspected of laundering criminal proceeds. Authorities uncovered 81 shadow cash-out groups with a combined turnover reaching 24 billion KZT ($43 million) in 2024. The enforcement actions follow Kazakhstan’s evolution from controlling 27% of global Bitcoin mining in 2021 after Chinese operations relocated, to just 4% by 2023 following grid strain and regulatory adjustments.

During the same period, President Tokayev announced “ CryptoCity ” in Alatau as a pilot zone for everyday crypto payments, featuring a crypto banking system providing exchange, storage, and transaction processing services while supporting anti-money laundering compliance. The digital tenge , the central bank’s digital currency, remains scheduled for full rollout by the end of this year as a third form of currency alongside cash and non-cash payments. However, the rollout remains uncertain this year.

55142233,https://cryptonews.com/?p=457939,1764496434,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/55142233.jpeg,Nasdaq Pledges Swift Push for SEC Approval of Tokenized Stocks,https://cryptonews.com/news/nasdaq-pledges-swift-push-for-sec-approval-of-tokenized-stocks/,"Nasdaq digital assets chief Matt Savarese announced the exchange has made its tokenized-stock proposal a top priority and will “ move as fast as we can ” with the SEC to secure approval. The proposal would allow trading of on-chain “ stock tokens ,” digital representations of publicly listed shares, under existing national market system rules. Speaking in a CNBC interview , Savarese emphasized that Nasdaq isn’t trying to upend the existing system but aims to bring tokenization into the mainstream responsibly under SEC oversight. “We’re not creating a new exotic instrument. The stock is the stock,” he said, stressing that investors would retain full rights and title as shareholders. The exchange filed its rule change application in September , seeking to permit listed equities and exchange-traded products to trade in tokenized form while maintaining the same investor protections and execution standards as traditional securities. Nasdaq Frames Tokenization as Evolution, Not Revolution The exchange’s approach centers on maintaining the current market structure while adding blockchain-based settlement options. “ The rules have existed for decades, and we don’t want to just completely rip out and upend the entire process, ” Savarese explained, noting that trades would continue flowing through Nasdaq’s order book under SEC rules and national market system oversight. Under the proposal, tokenized shares would carry the same rights as their underlying securities, including voting privileges and dividend rights. “ It’s fully fungible between the token and its traditional form, ” he said, explaining that clearing firms and the Depository Trust Company would process tokenized orders alongside conventional stocks under the same ticker symbols and CUSIP identifiers. The executive stressed that Nasdaq positions itself as “ the original innovator ” in market infrastructure evolution, comparing tokenization to the exchange’s earlier shift from paper-based to electronic trading. “ It’s evolutionary. It’s not really revolutionary, ” he said, describing the effort as bringing the ecosystem along gradually while ensuring investor-first principles remain paramount. SEC is developing a plan to enable stocks to trade like crypto on a blockchain, backed by Nasdaq, despite resistance from Wall Street incumbents. #Stock #Crypto #SEC https://t.co/A09i0i1JCi — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 30, 2025 Post-Trade Efficiency and Collateral Mobility Drive Near-Term Benefits Savarese outlined a phased timeline for tokenization benefits, with near-term gains focused on back-end processing improvements. Tokenized settlement would create process efficiencies immediately, though the exchange plans to maintain seamless integration with existing member firm systems before pursuing faster settlement speeds. Beyond settlement, enhanced collateral mobility emerged as a critical medium-term advantage. “ Being able to take that equity, put it into a collateral pool, allow folks to be able to move that asset instantaneously can help along the lines of making sure that you have capital efficiency, ” Savarese said, noting this would eliminate the need to overcollateralize positions. Longer-term applications extend to corporate actions, proxy voting, and programmable smart contract functionality. “ You start to get the programmable nature of what blockchain is and smart contracts are intended for, ” he explained. Nasdaq’s acquisition of Calypso through its Adenza deal provides the exchange with what Savarese called “ the gold standard ” in collateral management software, now integrated with blockchain rails to support tokenized asset movement. Regulatory Path Forward Remains Central Focus The exchange has entered the public comment period following its September filing, with responses closed by mid-October. “ We’ll move as fast as we can with the SEC and make sure that we try to push this through, ” Savarese said, expressing confidence that tokenization represents a priority topic for the current administration. While declining to provide specific approval timelines given uncertainties, including recent government disruptions, the executive emphasized Nasdaq’s collaborative approach. “ We’re not looking at kind of upending the system. We want everyone to come along with us for that ride and bring tokenization more into the mainstream, but we want to do it in that responsible investor-led way, ” he said. SEC Chair Paul Atkins has directed the agency to develop clear rules on digital asset classification. At the same time, Commissioner Hester Peirce recently affirmed the regulator’s willingness to work with tokenization firms, provided they maintain full disclosure about asset characteristics. Nasdaq already filed SR-NASDAQ-2025-072 to list tokenized equities/ETPs, and the SEC’s public-comment window closes Oct 14. Commissioner Hester Peirce also said today the agency is willing to work with tokenization efforts—signaling tangible follow-through, not just chatter. — Briefing Block (@briefing_block_) September 30, 2025 Nasdaq’s filing comes as global tokenized stock markets have surged past $465 million in market value, with monthly transfer volumes climbing more than 280% according to RWA.xyz data. Source: RWA[dot]xyz Despite momentum, resistance persists from traditional financial institutions. The World Federation of Exchanges has urged regulators to tighten oversight of tokenized equities , warning that blockchain-based products may “ mimic ” traditional stocks without conferring shareholder rights or market safeguards that characterize regulated securities trading.

Presently, hashprice, the metric that measures expected miner profitability per unit of computer power, sits at record lows. According to a report from CoinWarz, Bitcoin’s next mining difficulty adjustment is expected to occur at block 927,369 at around 12:09:34 AM UTC, increasing the difficulty marginally from 149.30 trillion to 149.80 trillion. The latest adjustment, which occurred on Thursday, saw the difficulty drop from 152.2 trillion to 149.3 million, a move that resulted in an average block time of about 9.97 minutes, putting it slightly below the 10-minute mark. Bitcoin mining difficulty predicted to rise next month Despite the recent drop in Bitcoin mining difficulty , hash price is presently close to $38.3 petahashes per second (PH/s) per day. According to Hashrate Index, the figure is up from the record low of below $35 PH/s that was recorded on November 21. For context, miners need the $40 PH/s as a break-even level, which is also coincidentally the point where they have to de-energize their machines or continue their operations. In addition, the drop in hash price has also been affecting the mining supply chain, with hardware providers filling fewer orders to struggling miners and taking a hit on any BTC-denominated sales due to the drop in price after the October market crash. Mining hardware manufacturers like Bitdeer have turned to self-mining to offset the shortfall in demand for mining machines. The high capital expenditures and the slim profit margins have seen miners rethink their operations. As computational power and electricity needed to mine blocks continue to rise as a result of the Bitcoin halving that occurs every four years, miners are now shifting into the AI data and compute business. According to reports, companies that have made the switch have generated billions of dollars in revenue. A typical example is Cipher Mining, with the firm inking a $5.5 billion deal with tech giant Amazon to provide compute power to Amazon Web Services over the next 15 years. Mining industry faces growing challenges The mining industry continues to face growing challenges , including regulatory bans or restrictions, increasing energy costs, and geopolitical tensions between the United States and China that threaten to disrupt critical equipment supply chains. Last month, the Abu Dhabi Agriculture and Food Safety Authority (ADAFSA) announced a ban on using agricultural land for crypto mining. Violators of the directive are also set to face fines of up to 100,000 AED. In addition, the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has also started a probe into mining manufacturer Bitmain, which has its base in China. The agency is trying to determine whether its machines can be remotely accessed or used to commit espionage. Last year, US Senator Elizabeth Warren, one of the most vocal crypto critics, suggested that ASICs could be used for spying on the United States military bases and sensitive national defense installations. “They’re loud, they’re hot, and they suck up a ton of electricity, which can crash the power grid,” she added. Meanwhile, Bitmain remains the leading manufacturer of ASICs used to mine proof-of-work (PoW) digital assets like Bitcoin. According to a University of Cambridge report, the company commands about 80% of the total market share. Sanctions, tariffs, or restrictions imposed on the company by the US could trigger a supply chain for the crypto mining industry, which relies heavily on Bitmain.

As the market faces volatility and uncertainty, tokens with practical applications will stand out. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , an ETH-based DeFi token, is gaining popularity among retail buyers. Its presale will allow investors to participate early and secure discounted tokens. With live features planned at launch, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will attract those seeking reliable DeFi exposure while navigating broader market uncertainty and a crypto crash. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Presale Momentum and Early Participation Mutuum Finance is developing a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol enabling crypto lending and borrowing through smart contracts. It offers both peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer models, supports variable and stable interest rates, and rewards users with its native token, MUTM. The platform is non-custodial, audited, and aims to grow via liquidity incentives. Halborn Security is conducting an independent audit of Mutuum Finance’s lending and borrowing contracts. The development phase is complete, and the finalized code is now undergoing detailed formal analysis to validate its security and robustness. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a total planned supply of 4 billion tokens. Across all presale phases, it has raised approximately $19 million and over 18,200 holders have participated in presale. Phase 6 is now priced at $0.035, with 95% of allocated tokens claimed. The next phase price will increase 15% to $0.040, creating a very tight window for buyers. Delay may cost them a quick 15% as price may go up anytime now. There is good news for investors as they are now able to buy MUTM using cards without any limits, making participation simple and fast. This is the last chance to secure discounted MUTM before the price increases. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Is Becoming Favorite Firstly, its platform and token is expected to launch simultaneously, generating early momentum. A working product will be available on day one, allowing users to interact with live lending and borrowing modules immediately. This synchronized rollout will attract Tier-1 and Tier-2 exchange attention. Once listed, MUTM will gain visibility and trading activity, while investors will be able to stake mtTokens for rewards, creating organic demand from the start. Secondly, the token’s value will come from platform activity rather than hype. Every feature — lending, borrowing, staking, and buybacks — will drive real utility. The roadmap includes an over-collateralized stablecoin system, allowing users to mint a $1-pegged stablecoin using ETH, SOL, or AVAX. Each mint and repayment transaction will generate transactional demand for MUTM. As the protocol expands, these features will increase utility and engagement, establishing MUTM as a core asset in the ecosystem and supporting ongoing demand long after listing. Finally, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will implement a buy-and-distribute mechanism. Part of the revenue from platform activity will buy back MUTM tokens from the open market. These tokens will be redistributed as rewards to mtToken stakers. This cycle will provide consistent buy pressure while rewarding long-term users. The more the platform is used, the higher the revenue and the more tokens will be redistributed to the community. Platform Launch and Protocol Highlights Mutuum Finance (MUTM) shared through its official X handle that the V1 release of its protocol is scheduled for deployment on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. This first release will bring the platform’s core modules online, including the liquidity pool, the mtToken and debt token structures, and an automated liquidator bot designed to protect collateral positions and maintain operational stability. During this stage, users will have access to lending, borrowing, and collateralization using ETH or USDT. Releasing V1 on the testnet gives the community an early opportunity to interact with the protocol before the mainnet launch. This staged rollout promotes transparency, encourages early participation, and helps the team gather meaningful insights for further refinement. As more users experiment with the testnet features, interest in the ecosystem may expand, contributing to long-term confidence and demand for the MUTM token. Conclusion and Giveaway Phase 6 of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is almost sold out, and the next phase will see a 15% price increase. So it is the perfect time to take your positions for MUTM now as delay may cost you a regret as 15% value gain is instant in line can be seen. Retail investors are drawn to MUTM for its ETH-based security, DeFi utility, and early-adopter rewards. With presale momentum, dual lending features, and a working platform at launch, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will continue to become a favorite among buyers seeking the best cryptocurrency coin to buy this season.

He shared a chart of the XRP/BTC pair showing the performance since the flash crash on October 10 . This massive liquidation event saw XRP drop to $1.52, its lowest level in 2025. It created immediate uncertainty across markets. Traders rushed to adjust positions as liquidity thinned. Volatility stayed elevated for days. The XRP/BTC chart he posted shows how the pair moved after that moment and how the market absorbed the shock. XRP vs BTC since 10/10 liquidation pic.twitter.com/Tmr63lSZz8 — Zach Rector (@ZachRector7) November 28, 2025 Price Action in the XRP/BTC Pair The chart begins in mid-October and shows a period of tight but active movement. XRP held a narrow band against BTC for several sessions. Small swings came quickly as buyers tested momentum. Sellers tried to keep control but failed to extend the decline . The pair then moved through late October with several sharp reversals. That pattern signaled a shift in control. In early November, the pair continued to move in a contained channel. XRP showed resilience as BTC posted mixed sessions. Traders saw repeated attempts to push the pair lower, with a notable attempt around November 5. However, XRP remained strong. The mid-month section of the chart displays a clear sequence of higher lows. This behavior supported the view that the October crash had cleared weak positions . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What’s Next for XRP? The late November rally created the strongest signal in the chart. XRP broke above the earlier range and printed a fast move toward 0.00002550 BTC. That level placed the pair near a short-term high. However, a pullback followed. The pair now trades around 0.00002398 BTC. The retracement does not resemble the disorder seen on October 10, suggesting this move is temporary as buyers reset their positions. The data shows XRP gaining stability after a severe test. Traders who monitor relative strength see that XRP defended support more effectively than expected. The chart suggests that pressure from the October liquidation event faded. BTC continues to dominate the market, but XRP is holding its ground. If the pair maintains current support, buyers may attempt another move toward the recent high. The absence of heavy selling pressure supports that possibility. The market will face new tests as volatility returns, but the chart suggests a constructive setup for XRP with a good chance of a short-term rally .

According to Bloomberg Intelligence senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone, Bitcoin could drop to $50,000, citing a confluence of macro forces, he said in an X post on November 28. In outlining his outlook, McGlone noted that Bitcoin’s slide relative to gold has accelerated, reinforcing a structural shift toward defensive positioning. With gold breaking record highs and absorbing haven flows, Bitcoin’s weakening performance against the metal has amplified downside momentum, raising the probability of a retest of its long-term $50,000 pivot, and potentially much worse if current trends persist. Christmas Grinch Bitcoin Gaining Bear Tracks: Does Gold Get It? Top factors that support Bitcoin revisiting its $50,000 pivot are normal reversion, record-setting gold, buried stock-market volatility and the unlimited supply of crypto companions. Will the risk-asset leading… pic.twitter.com/Knxk2Dx1Ru — Mike McGlone (@mikemcglone11) November 28, 2025 A key concern is the backdrop of compressed stock-market volatility and a broad risk-off rotation. The strategist noted that equity markets have remained relatively calm, but he warns this tranquility may be masking deeper cracks. His analysis shows that historically, the S&P 500 often follows Bitcoin when it drops below its 50-week moving average (MA). Currently, both Bitcoin and the S&P 500 sit beneath these key trendlines, signaling rising risk across major assets. Past breaks, like in 2018, during the 2020 pandemic, and in 2022’s bear market, saw equities soon mirror Bitcoin’s decline, suggesting the current alignment could again drag stocks lower. Adding pressure is what the strategist calls the “unlimited supply” of crypto competitors, which continues to dilute market share and soften Bitcoin’s dominance during periods of stress. Combined with mean-reversion forces and deteriorating liquidity conditions, the environment resembles past deflationary phases in which Bitcoin suffered deep retracements. Bitcoin price analysis Indeed, McGlone’s warning comes as Bitcoin reclaimed the $90,000 resistance, which has now turned into a fragile support zone. By press time, the cryptocurrency was trading at $91,415, up almost 1% in the past 24 hours, while on the weekly timeline, the asset has rallied 6%. Despite these gains, Bitcoin’s technical structure leans bearish. The 50-day SMA sits at $103,001 and the 200-day SMA at $104,439, placing the current price well below both key trend markers. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold This alignment confirms a sustained loss of upward momentum and reinforces a broader downtrend, as traders typically view prices trading beneath both SMAs as a sign that sellers remain in control. The 14-day RSI stands at 40.50, hovering in neutral territory but leaning toward weakness.

Peirce, who is also the head of the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, has always been at the forefront of financial freedom. The SEC Commissioner made these known during an interview on The Roll Up podcast . “I’m a freedom maximalist,” Peirce said, noting that self-custody of digital assets is a fundamental human right. “Why should I have to be forced to go through someone else to hold my assets? It baffles me that in this country, which is so premised on freedom, that would even be an issue — of course, people can hold their own assets,” the SEC Commissioner added. SEC Commissioner reiterates stance on crypto self-custody During the interview, Peirce added that online financial privacy should be the standard. “It has become the presumption that if you want to keep your transactions private, you’re doing something wrong, but it should be exactly the opposite presumption,” she said. Her comments are also coming after news that the Digital Asset Market Structure Clarity Act , a crypto market structure bill that includes several provisions, will be delayed until 2026. The news was shared on blogging platform X (formerly Twitter) by Senator Tim Scott. “Our crypto market structure work is about empowering the American people – including single moms like the one who raised me. We’re aiming to markup bipartisan legislation next month and get it to President Trump’s desk to keep America economically dominant for decades,” he said. The bill is expected to include asset taxonomy, anti-money laundering regulations, and provisions for self-custody. Over the past few months, many large Bitcoin whales and long-term holders have been shifting how they hold assets, pivoting from self-custody to ETFs to reap the tax benefits and hassle-free management of owning digital assets in an investment vehicle. The development was brought to the mainstream media by Martin Hiesbock, head of blockchain and crypto research at financial services platform Uphold. Large Bitcoin holders shift holdings to ETFs Hiesbock claimed that the movement of large amounts of Bitcoin into ETFs marks the first time in more than 15 years that there has been a significant decline in the number of self-custodied BTC. “Another nail in the coffin of the original crypto spirit,” he wrote. He added that the “not your keys, not your coins” ethos that has always accompanied digital assets has given rise to a more traditional approach that centers on compliance and financial optimization. “The shift is driven by the convenience and significant tax benefits offered by ETFs, as well as the ability for major investors to manage their wealth through existing financial advisers and access broader investment/lending services,” Hiesboeck said. Leading the charge is BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which has already seen over $3 billion worth of Bitcoin from whales, according to Robbie Mitchnick, head of digital assets at BlackRock. In addition, popular Bitcoin analyst and investor PlanB announced that he was transferring his Bitcoin to ETFs to alleviate the hassle of private key management. PlanB, the developer of the BTC stock-to-flow model, announced in February, noting that he made the decision so he could manage his holdings more like equities and bonds, without the complexities of self-custody. “I guess I am not a maxi anymore,” PlanB said in an X post at the time.

Egrag Crypto, known for his long-standing bullish stance on XRP, released a new technical update that breaks down the future outlook for the cryptocurrency into three straightforward outcomes. The chart accompanying his analysis shows XRP trading around the $2.20 region, sitting just above an important Fib support level but still wrestling with momentum, with the monthly candle about to close. Related Reading: 320 Ether On The Move: Bhutan Ramps Up Its Staking Game XRP Must Close Above $2.60 To Keep Bullish Momentum Intact Egrag’s first decisive level is at $2.60, which matches with the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level on the monthly chart. The analyst described a close above this region as bullish but the asset would not yet be fully clear of danger. The chart shows XRP repeatedly testing this price level in the first half of the year before breaking above it in July. However, the most recent breakdown in Q2 2025 has now put the price level in focus again. The analysis becomes more aggressive once price action breaks above $3.40. EGRAG identified this as the 0.888 Fibonacci level, one of the final retracement zones. According to him, a close above this level confirms a super-bullish macro breakout, which he summarized with the phrase “we are so back.” The chart reinforces this idea by showing a tight compression beneath this upper 0.888 Fib cluster, and that a decisive breakout could lead to a rapid move into new all-time high prices if there’s enough buying pressure. XRP Price Chart. Source: @egragcrypto On X A Close Below 21 EMA Would Break Bullish Structure The downside scenario in Egrag’s breakdown is equally straightforward. He warned that a close below the 21-month EMA would mean a severe failure of the bullish trend structure. His wording was intentionally harsh, noting that such a breakdown would mean “we are f**ked, no sugar-coating it.” The chart shows the 21 EMA currently sitting around the $1.83-$1.90 price zone, forming the final major support on the monthly timeframe. Losing this level would drag XRP back into a deeper corrective zone and finally undo most of the price advancement made this year. A significant development showed up towards the end of the week that aligns with the bullish continuation Egrag outlined. 21Shares confirmed that its US Spot XRP ETF, which is listed under the ticker TOXR, has received SEC approval and will officially launch on Monday.

The cryptocurrency held a strong market structure following several days of price consolidation. XRP price chart, Source: CoinMarketCap Technical indicators pointed toward continued strength in the near term. Market analysts noted that XRP's ability to defend the $2.00 support level demonstrated solid underlying demand. The broader cryptocurrency market showed signs of recovery, with Bitcoin trading at around $91,326 and Ethereum $3,007 at press time. Institutional Capital Flows Into XRP Products ETF inflows reached approximately $666.6 million in November within just two weeks of launch. The 21Shares U.S. spot XRP ETF will begin trading on Monday under the ticker symbol TOXR. This marked a significant milestone for institutional access to the digital asset. Major financial firms backed their XRP ETF offerings. Grayscale and Franklin Templeton both supported products tracking the cryptocurrency's performance. The seven-day period saw XRP climb 16% as institutional participation accelerated. Large holders increased their positions substantially. Wallets containing over one billion XRP added approximately 150 million tokens since November 25. At current prices, this represented roughly $330 million in new capital allocation. The whale accumulation suggested confidence among sophisticated investors. Technical Setup Points to Higher Prices The current price structure remained constructive for bulls. XRP traded firmly above the critical $2.00 support zone, which buyers defended throughout recent sessions. This level served as a foundation for the next potential leg higher. The MACD indicator showed narrowing lines near the centerline. This pattern typically preceded increased volatility in either direction. However, the price action suggested upward movement remained more likely given recent momentum. The Relative Strength Index registered around 52, indicating balanced market conditions. This mid-range reading left substantial room for appreciation before reaching overbought territory. Traders viewed this as favorable for sustained gains. Price targets came into focus as momentum built. The immediate resistance sat at $2.40, followed by $2.60 as the next key level.

By 2028, CRO could reach a maximum value of $0.8337, with an average trading price of $0.7410. Cronos is expected to reach a maximum level of $2.56 in 2031. Cronos (CRO) is the native cryptocurrency token of the cronos chain, a decentralized, open-source blockchain developed by the Crypto.com payment, trading, and financial services company. CRO aims to power the next generation of decentralized crypto assets and applications, serving as a utility token. And enable real-time, low-cost transactions globally. Cronos cross-bridge mainnet beta suggests a bright future for CRO. This feature aims to improve interoperability between significant blockchain ecosystems, potentially increasing CRO’s attractiveness to developers and users. CRO’s recent performance reflects robust market sentiment and confidence. These factors, combined, present Cronos as a compelling investment opportunity within the dynamic crypto market, thereby increasing the demand for CRO. Eminem’s involvement comes as Crypto.com has been actively expanding its visibility through various high-profile partnerships, including those with actor Matt Damon, major sports teams, and even Trump Media. In this Cronos price prediction, we’ll focus on exploring the future market trends of CRO, its current price momentum, and its past performance, using in-depth technical analysis and a price prediction model. Overview Cryptocurrency Cronos Token CRO Price $0.1070 Market Capitalization $4.56B Trading Volume (24-hour) $28.76M Circulating Supply 36.1B CRO All-time High $0.9698 Nov 24, 2021 All-time Low $0.01149 Dec 17, 2018 24-h High $0.1092 24-h Low $0.1063 Cronos Price Prediction: Technical Analysis Metric Value Price Volatility (30-day variation) 13.25% 50-Day SMA $0.1363 14-Day RSI 40.56 Sentiment Bearish Green Days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $0.1418 Price Prediction $0.1172 (+7.44%) Cronos price analysis: CRO of value holds steady near the $0.107 zone CRO remains confined to a narrow price range, staying between $0.1063 and $0.1092, signaling limited volatility and no clear direction. Strong resistance caps upside repeated failures at $0.109, showing steady selling pressure that blocks upward movement. Key support holds firm, buyers continue to defend $0.106, making it the critical level preventing further downside. On November 30, 2025, Cronos trades near $0.1079 after a slight 0.07% dip over the past 24 hours. The token trades between $0.1063 and $0.1092, showing limited volatility as price action stayed tight. CRO remains far below its $0.9698 all-time high from November 2021, reflecting prolonged market weakness. Cronos daily price chart: CRO holds steady with $0.106 acting as key daily support The daily chart showed CRO holding a flat structure around $0.107, with price hovering near the midpoint of its recent range. Momentum remained neutral as neither buyers nor sellers failed to take control. Several attempts to break above $0.109 were rejected, confirming strong resistance and steady overhead supply. CRO/USDT Chart: TradingView The $0.106 level continued to act as key support, marked by repeated rebounds on the daily timeframe. Low volume pointed to reduced participation and ongoing indecision. CRO remained stuck in a neutral-to-weak pattern, unable to form higher highs or higher lows as the range tightened. Cronos 4-hour price chart: CRO faces firm resistance at $0.109 On the 4-hour chart, CRO displayed a slight downward leaning but remained largely range-bound around the $0.107 area. Price trades between $0.1063 and $0.1092 boundaries, showing no clear breakout attempt. Sellers continued to respond near the $0.108–$0.109 band, preventing continuation of upward momentum. This level acted as immediate resistance, forming a short-term barrier that the market failed to clear in consecutive sessions. CRO/USDT Chart: TradingView The chart illustrated repeated rebounds from this area, but without strong follow-through from buyers. The market structure suggested CRO could remain in this holding pattern unless strong volume re-enters the market. Short-term bias was mildly bearish due to lower highs forming throughout the intraday sequence. Cronos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.1845 SELL SMA 5 $0.1558 SELL SMA 10 $0.1006 BUY SMA 21 $0.1146 SELL SMA 50 $0.1363 SELL SMA 100 $0.1791 SELL SMA 200 $0.1418 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.1256 SELL EMA 5 $0.1430 SELL EMA 10 $0.1725 SELL EMA 21 $0.1863 SELL EMA 50 $0.1702 SELL EMA 100 $0.1466 SELL EMA 200 $0.1283 SELL What to expect from Cronos? CRO is likely to remain within its current tight range unless stronger momentum develops. A close above $0.109 would be the first sign of renewed bullish interest, potentially opening room for a short-term recovery. If buyers fail to reclaim that level, price may continue drifting sideways as selling pressure persists near the upper boundary. On the downside, $0.106 remains the critical support to watch. A breakdown below this level could expose CRO to deeper weakness, especially if volume picks up on the move. For now, the market favors consolidation, with neither side showing enough strength to force a decisive breakout. Is Cronos a good investment? Cronos can be viewed as a moderate-risk asset, and whether it is a good investment depends on an investor’s risk tolerance, time horizon, and belief in the project’s long-term ecosystem growth. The token has shown extended weakness compared to its 2021 peak, which highlights its sensitivity to broader market cycles and shifts in demand. CRO’s value largely depends on the performance of the Cronos Chain, the adoption of its ecosystem, and the continued expansion of Crypto.com’s products and user base. While the project maintains active development and real-world utility through payment, DeFi, and Web3 applications, its price performance has remained subdued, reflecting limited momentum. Investors typically view CRO as a long-term speculative asset rather than a short-term momentum play. Anyone considering exposure should evaluate fundamentals, market conditions, and their own financial strategy before making a decision. This analysis is not financial advice, and independent research is essential before investing. Why Is Cronos (CRO) Down Today? The primary reasons for CRO’s muted performance today include consistent overhead resistance, lack of strong buying momentum, and a broader market environment characterized by cautious sentiment. Without new catalysts or heightened trading activity, the token is likely to continue drifting sideways in the short term. Market participants should watch key levels closely, particularly $0.106 support and $0.109 resistance, to anticipate potential shifts in price direction. Recent news Cronos completed its “Smarturn” upgrade on October 30, 2025, boosting EVM compatibility, scalability, and interoperability. The update added EIP-7702 smart accounts, integrated Go-Ethereum v1.15.11 (with Cancun/Prague opcodes), introduced eth_getBlockReceipts, and improved transaction speed through PriorityNonceMempool and AnteCache. With IBC v2 integration for faster cross-chain communication, Smarturn enhances DeFi efficiency, lowers gas costs, and strengthens Cronos’s role as a leading Ethereum-compatible layer-1 in the Crypto.com ecosystem. Will Cronos reach $0.5? Based on long-term forecasts, Cronos (CRO) is projected to reach $ 0.50 by 2027, potentially increasing its market capitalization as its ecosystem and user adoption continue to grow. Will Cronos reach $1? Projections for Cronos estimate it could reach $1 by 2029, driven by its expansion in DeFi, NFT integrations, and partnerships. Will Cronos reach $100? It is unlikely that Cronos’s price will reach $100, as this would require an extremely high market capitalization, surpassing the current CRO coin price prediction for the cryptocurrency sector. Does Cronos have an excellent long-term future? Cronos CRO holds promising long-term potential due to Crypto.com ’s ongoing innovations, such as DEX expansions, NFT integration, and metaverse applications, collectively enhancing CRO’s appeal and utility. These strategic initiatives, along with CRO’s liquidity, staking rewards, and network governance, position it as a solid investment for those with a long-term perspective, especially considering institutional adoption.

Hayes claimed that MON was “99% fail-safe” and argued that the project was “not even close” to Solana. Hon, however, defended Monad's differences in a statement, detailing both the project and the technology being developed. In his message to Hayes, Hon began by expressing his respect for his contributions to the cryptocurrency industry, and then pointed out that recent comments about the Monad may have been taken out of context. Following the ensuing criticism, he addressed the question, “Why is the Monad different?” one by one. According to Hon's statement, the salient features of Monad are summarized as follows: Monad's primary focus is speed. Hon noted that when users withdraw MON from Coinbase, their assets appear on the network within 1–2 seconds, a result of the newly developed architecture. Monad is built entirely from scratch in C++ and Rust, incorporating high-frequency trading (HFT)-style optimizations. Built on this architecture, the network, powered by 170 global validators, aims to deliver high speed while maintaining decentralization. Hon argued that Monad proves the contrary, challenging the prevailing assumption that blockchains must be centralized to be efficient. Unlike Layer 2 (L2) or data center chains, which rely on a single sequencer, Monad creates a “neutral, decentralized, and trustless infrastructure.” According to the founder, Monad's technical innovations include the new consensus mechanism MonadBFT, which is said to solve the tail forking problem; Async Execution, which increases efficiency by separating consensus and execution; a JIT compiler that compiles to native code; the new database MonadDb; the advanced block propagation system RaptorCast; and parallel execution. Hon noted that Ethereum is similarly working to transition to an async execution model, claiming that Monad offers industry-leading innovations. Related News: Altcoins with the Most Buybacks in the Last 30 Days Revealed Hon stated that the ecosystem is still at the beginning of the road, but new applications are being developed rapidly with young and aggressive teams, and that the Monad Foundation and Category Labs will continue to advance aggressively in research and development. Hon noted that MON was the first token listed on Coinbase's token sale platform, explaining that the sale was conducted using a “bottom-up” model to prevent whales from collecting the entire sale. He noted that this method aims to generate as broad participation as possible. At the end of his statement, Hon offered to send MON to Arthur Hayes and said, “Thank you again for your contributions, see you on the chain.” *This is not investment advice.

XRP’s higher-low formation, paired with strong upward momentum, underscores clear buyer dominance, especially as exchange supply plunges over 45% in just 60 days. This bullish structure signals that buyers are stepping in earlier with every dip, a classic sign of growing confidence and sustained demand. With market sentiment turning cautious across the broader crypto landscape, XRP’s ability to maintain rising lows and accelerating momentum highlights its relative strength and a decisive shift in favor of the bulls. Trader Rai highlights $2.20 as the decisive level that will determine whether XRP’s momentum turns into a full bullish continuation. Holding this retest zone would confirm the higher-low structure and show that buyers are confidently absorbing sell pressure, keeping firm control of the trend. Holding above $2.20 positions XRP for a clean move toward its next major resistance levels, where the market’s reaction will reveal whether the bullish trend can sustain. A decisive breakout through these zones would strengthen the upward trajectory and draw in sidelined buyers waiting for confirmation. However, a drop below $2.20 could trigger short-term uncertainty, though the broader bullish structure remains intact unless a deeper breakdown unfolds. Therefore, Trader Rai’s analysis underscores a key takeaway that XRP’s price action reflects a market steadily gaining bullish strength. Momentum, structure, and critical support levels are aligning decisively in favor of continuation. As long as buyers defend the $2.20 zone, the odds of XRP pushing into higher resistance levels remain firmly on their side. In a market where confidence thrives on clear technical signals, XRP is displaying the disciplined bullish structure analysts expect in the early stages of a breakout. If current conditions persist, the asset appears poised for its next major leg upward—driven by buyers who show no signs of stepping back. XRP Supply on Exchanges Plunges Over 45% in 60 Days, Signaling a Major Market Shift Market expert Xaif Crypto acknowledges one of XRP’s largest supply contractions in years. Glassnode data shows centralized exchange balances have plunged over 45% in just 60 days, signaling a dramatic shift in holder behavior and potential for heightened price volatility. Exchange-held XRP has plummeted from 3.95 billion on September 21 to 2.6 billion by November 27, removing over 1.3 billion tokens from liquid supply. This sharp decline signals more than routine movement, it reflects a growing trend of investors moving XRP into self-custody, long-term holdings, or staking, highlighting rising confidence in the asset’s long-term value. Xaif Crypto stipulates that the sharp drop in XRP supply on exchanges signals rising accumulation and waning sell-side pressure. Withdrawn tokens are less likely to hit the market, a pattern that often precedes bullish moves. Xaif Crypto notes that such a supply shock can ‘tip the balance entirely toward buyers,’ especially if demand picks up. “Glassnode data shows whales and long-term holders are driving XRP accumulation, signaling a shift from speculative trading to strategic holding. With exchange supply down 45%, market attention is turning to volume, liquidity, and potential breakout patterns. This decline isn’t just a number, it reflects growing confidence and a market positioning itself for what could be a major move in the weeks ahead. Conclusion Notably, XRP’s market structure signals clear bullish control. Trader Rai notes that the higher-low formation and accelerating upward momentum keep buyers in command. Holding above the $2.20 retest zone could pave the way toward higher resistance levels, with growing momentum and favorable sentiment positioning XRP for a potential breakout that may set its next major trend. On the other hand, the 45% plunge in XRP supply on exchanges signals a decisive market shift. With more tokens moving into long-term holdings, sell-side pressure is easing, paving the way for potential bullish momentum. This trend reflects growing confidence in XRP’s long-term value and underscores how supply scarcity can drive price action. Monitoring exchange balances and accumulation trends will be crucial in anticipating XRP’s next major move.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-30 10:56:11

According to reports, the police were alerted to suspicious activities going on in the building, leading to a raid led by the Cyberabad police on the location. Indian police officers attached to the operation claimed that the telecallers were meticulously trained to mimic the Australian accent. The criminals also knew how to take on a high-pitched rising intonation at the end of their sentences by dropping the ‘r’ sound at the end of their words. Indian police busts fraud network targeting Australians According to the Indian police, the criminals had used their knowledge of the Australian accent to carve out a niche criminal market for themselves. The police claimed that they had siphoned funds from several victims halfway across the world. During the raid, which took place on Saturday, police arrested nine telecallers, including six who were from the West Bengal region. However, the Indian police claimed that two kingpins escaped and are still on the run. Investigators claimed that the masterminds behind the operation held several recruitments, prioritizing Indian students and others who had lived in Australia at one point in their lives. The criminals used their familiarity with the country to build credibility. The scammers also allegedly gained access to their victims’ banking details, using them to further their criminal activities. Once their operations have reached the point of extracting funds, they use the account details to collect funds. The Indian police claimed that they arrested several individuals, including Y Ganesh, M Chennai Keshav, M Mondal, Eazaz Ahmed, Samvit Roy, Shannik Benerjee, M Mallick, Silpi Samadder, and Kunal Singh, after searches in the buildings where the criminals carried out their illegal operations. Though the building was rented under the pretext of a legitimate call center, Indian police claimed that the criminals used it for their illegal activities. According to the Indian police, the sophisticated fraud targeted Australians, but they also focused their operations on other countries. The police claimed two individuals, Praveen and Prakash, coordinated with other unknown cybercriminals and armed themselves with the details of Australian residents. The police claimed that they used the details to contact unsuspecting victims, deploying a series of targeted acts to obtain funds under pretenses. Scammers target Australians with fake pop-ups In the past year, authorities claimed that the criminals have amassed between Rs. 8 crore and Rs. 10 crore. The police claimed that those currently working at the call centers were vigorously trained for years, getting them ready to be able to carry out the illicit acts and appear legitimate. This way, they dupe their victims with ease, and while reporting the crime, the victims would only report that they were scammed by someone operating in the country or a native of the country operating abroad. “This group sent fake pop-ups and emails to Australian citizens, falsely claiming that their computer was compromised. The pop-up contained a customer care phone number. When the victim called the number, the call was routed through the X-Lite application, which landed in the fake call center operated from Ayyappa society,” the Indian police said. They also claimed that the accused convinced the victims to allow remote access to their computers using the AnyDesk application. After gaining access to the computers, the suspects then move to their victims’ bank accounts and illegally move funds belonging to them to Australian bank accounts owned by Indian nationals who had previously resided in the country. The accused then routes the funds through digital assets and other local methods, moving them into India. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Most larger-cap altcoins are sluggish on a daily scale, aside from HYPE, AVAX, and ZEC – all of which have dumped hard since yesterday. BTC Taps $91K As mentioned above, the previous business week was quite painful for the primary cryptocurrency as it plunged below $81,000 for the first time since April. This meant that it had lost over $25,000 in just ten days. The bulls finally stepped up at this point and defended the $80,000 support. BTC started to recover some ground and quickly bounced to $84,000 last weekend. Its more impressive gains came during the business week when it initiated a leg up to $88,000 by Wednesday. Although that resistance held at first, the bulls managed to break through it that night, and bitcoin even jumped past $90,000 at the end of the week. Its local high came on Friday morning when it surged to just over $93,000. However, it couldn’t keep climbing , and the subsequent rejection drove it to the $90,000-$91,000 range, where it has been situated for the past 36 hours or so. Its market cap has increased to $1.820 trillion, while its dominance over the alts stands tall above 57% on CG. BTCUSD/30.11. Source: TradingView Weekly Gainers The weekly charts are quite impressive, given the rebound attempts by many altcoins. ETH and XRP are up by over 7% to $3,000 and $2.20, respectively. SOL has gained 5% and so has HYPE, even though it’s down by 6% in the past 24 hours. XMR, XLM, AVAX, SUI, SHIB, CC, and AAVE are also well in the green weekly. ZEC trades differently than most altcoins again, but this time in a painful manner. The privacy token has plunged by over 21% since last Sunday and now sits below $450. The total crypto market cap has added over $300 billion since last Friday’s low and is close to $3.2 trillion now. Cryptocurrency Market Overview Weekly.

With a market cap of $1.82tn trillion and nearly 20 million BTC in circulation, the asset remains at the center of macro debate, especially after Robert Kiyosaki reignited fears of a looming financial reset. Kiyosaki Flags Liquidity Shock Robert Kiyosaki, author of Rich Dad Poor Dad , has again sounded the alarm on what he believes is a brewing global crash. His warning lands at a moment when financial markets are struggling with what analysts call a “two-front liquidity squeeze”: Japan’s shifting fiscal posture and tightening conditions in US funding markets. Kiyosaki often frames Bitcoin as a safeguard against monetary erosion, but this time, the forces pressuring risk assets are more mechanical than philosophical. Money is simply leaving the system. Yen Unwind Creates Global Pressure Japan’s recent pivot, marked by heavier government spending and rising bond yields, has deepened yen weakness. The move is forcing investors to unwind years of carry trades, where cheap yen borrowing financed global risk-taking. As these leveraged positions collapse, liquidity thins across equities, bonds, and digital assets. Japan “Carry Trade” ended. Watch out below. Bubble Markets about to deflate. Standing by my mantra…buy gold, silver, Bitcoin, and Ethereum. More recommendations on how to get rich while world collapses will follow in future Tweets. Yes: you can get richer while world gets… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) November 29, 2025 For Bitcoin, this dynamic is double-edged. Near-term liquidity stress can weigh on prices, but long-term, the unwind may push investors toward decentralized assets as a hedge against fiscal instability. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technical Outlook Turns Constructive Despite macro headwinds, Bitcoin price prediction is showing early signs of stabilization. BTC has bounced sharply from the $81,028 support, an area that has consistently acted as a higher-timeframe demand zone since mid-2024. The daily chart shows a clean bullish reaction, with long lower wicks and follow-through buying. BTC is now testing the 20-day EMA at $92,800, which shifted into resistance after November’s breakdown. A decisive close above this level would mark Bitcoin’s first meaningful structural improvement in weeks. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Momentum is improving as the RSI climbs from 32 to 41, consistent with an early recovery phase. The chart structure hints at a rounded retest: a pullback toward $88,000, formation of a higher low, and a potential drive toward $98,279, which aligns with the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement. A reclaim of $98,279 opens the door to $103,574 and $108,753, where a larger correction may fully reverse. A breakout above $108,753 would flip the broader trend, setting up a run toward $115,000 in early 2026. Bitcoin Outlook and Trade Setup The cleanest setup appears on a confirmed daily close above the 20-EMA, supported by a higher low near $88,000–$89,500. With invalidation below $86,000, upside targets extend toward $103,000 and $108,000. Should sentiment improve, Bitcoin’s recovery could spill over into early-stage opportunities, including presale tokens positioned for the next market expansion, setting the stage for a stronger cycle ahead. Maxi Doge: The Meme Coin Built for Maximum Hype Maxi Doge is exploding in popularity as traders rush toward its high-energy meme identity and fast-growing presale. With over $4.20 million raised, it’s quickly becoming one of the standout meme tokens of the year. The project mixes bold branding with real engagement features, from ROI contests to nonstop community events, giving it more personality and momentum than typical dog coins. Its shredded, leverage-obsessed mascot has already turned Maxi Doge into a recognizable culture coin. Holders can also stake $MAXI for daily smart-contract rewards and unlock access to exclusive competitions and partner events. The staking utility adds a passive-earning layer that keeps users active and invested in the ecosystem. With $MAXI priced at $0.00027 and the next increase approaching, the presale continues to gain speed. If you’re looking for a meme coin built on hype, personality, and real community energy, Maxi Doge is shaping up to be one worth watching.

55146534,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=869972,1764502200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/55146534.jpeg,Will Cardano (ADA) Price Rebound as Hoskinson Hints at a TVL Surge Or Will This New Crypto Take The Spotlight?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/will-cardano-ada-price-rebound-as-hoskinson-hints-at-a-tvl-surge-or-will-this-new-crypto-take-the-spotlight/,"The cryptocurrency market is in dire need of some strong momentum, and the likes of established coins like Cardano (ADA) are under the closest observation. The ADA price has plummeted considerably and is currently slumping near the multi-month levels. Charles Hoskinson, the mastermind behind Cardano, has prophesied the Total Value Locked on the platform to witness an increase in the coming days, focusing on the impending launch on the Midnight platform and the rumored RealFi project. While this has led to some interesting chatter in the ADA ranks, the Total Value Locked on the platform has plummeted considerably in the present scenario, despite the overall downturn in the market. Simultaneously, the emergence of a strong up-and-coming rival in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is setting the benchmark on what pre-launch performance should ideally include. Cardano’s Road to Recovery Recently, the Cardano price has placed the asset among the worst-performing in the industry. Adoption levels on the network have come under fire, and the TVL figures highlight the issue. The bullish outlook offered by Hoskinson aims to dispel this, positing that the impending launch of the Midnight data protection platform and the large RealFi initiative could bring much-needed use and investment into the space. In terms of technicals, the ADA price now appears oversold, and the charts could see an uplift here. The network, however, has some work to do in translating promised partnerships into on-chain action. Unfortunately, this has led a number of would-be investors into the limelight elsewhere, making the search for the best cryptocurrency to invest in now zero in on those in the final development phases prior to launch in the world of decentralized finance. Mutuum Finance Presale Approaches Critical Point While Cardano has plans for a future comeback, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is precisely following through on its launch strategy. The organized presale offered by the project has become a thing of note, having raised $19,020,000 and accumulated 18,250 holders. The presale has now hit Phase 6, and the cost of the MUTM token now stands at $0.035. This represents a whopping 250% increase from the cost in Phase 1, making early supporters rich. An important detail for individuals interested in purchasing the token is the fact that Phase 6 has only allocated 95%, and things are selling out fast. This is the last chance fans get to own the much-awaited Mutuum Finance token at the $0.035 cost, since in Phase 7, the cost increases by almost 20%, launching at $0.040. At the officially announced cost at $0.06, those who decide on top crypto to buy now are in line for rather large gains when the asset goes live, potentially culminating in over 400% gains. The site encourages continued engagement through an innovative 24-hour leaderboard system. The leaderboard ranks the top 50 holders, and the number-one holder on each and every day gets a $500 MUTM reward, provided they make at least one trade in the 24-hour period. The leaderboard resets each day at 00:00 UTC. Moreover, the team has worked on easing access, and now the investor can use their card directly to invest in the platform by purchasing the MUTM tokens. Mutuum Finance encourages those researching the cryptocurrency platform that would be the best investment option through their clear and straightforward investment process. The development pace has also continued to strengthen its position, with an independent review of its loans and borrow contracts launched by Halborn Security. The project has also announced the confirmation of its V1 protocol on the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025, marking an essential transition from an idea to a working product. A Clear Choice for Forward-Thinking Investors The contrast between the speculative rally and the measurable progress could not be clearer. Mutuum Finance, abbreviated as MUTM, has an engaging scenario that positions it favorably in the lineup of the next big crypto platforms. The fact that the presale process has almost concluded in phase 6, accompanied by the high levels of development and the developing base, provides an attractive deal. The time slot available at the present price has almost run out, making it an imperative step in realizing the greatest returns. Furthermore, the choice available among the different cryptocurrencies available in the market has become clearer.

55146171,https://coinpaper.com/12760/top-ripple-executive-xrp-must-learn-from-solana-before-it-s-too-late,1764502479,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png,Top Ripple Executive: XRP Must Learn from Solana Before It's Too Late,https://coinpaper.com/12760/top-ripple-executive-xrp-must-learn-from-solana-before-it-s-too-late,"Luke Judges, Ripple's Global Partner Success Lead and Director, recently addressed misconceptions about his past involvement with Solana. The executive clarified that joining Ripple does not mean abandoning respect for other blockchain ecosystems. Judges revealed his extensive history with Solana before his current role. He founded two startups within the Solana ecosystem. He also operated a validator node that managed over $30 million in staked assets. His experience spans the full market cycle, witnessing Solana's price collapse from $200 to $8 before its subsequent recovery. Solana's Strengths and Weaknesses Judges acknowledged that Solana faces ongoing challenges. The network currently experiences a declining validator count. This presents concerns about decentralization and network security. Despite these issues, Judges maintains that Solana offers valuable lessons. He specifically highlighted the network's pragmatic approach and execution speed. These qualities have enabled Solana to rapidly gain market share. The executive suggested that XRP and other Layer 1 blockchains should study Solana's strategies. Learning from competitors strengthens the entire blockchain industry. Judges also noted Ethereum's response to competitive pressure. The Ethereum Foundation has sharpened its market strategy after losing ground to Solana. This demonstrates how competition drives innovation across blockchain platforms. The Ripple lead stressed that XRP does not operate in isolation. The blockchain can adopt successful strategies from other networks while maintaining its unique advantages. XRP's Smart Contract Evolution The timing of Judges' comments aligns with significant developments in the XRP ecosystem. XRP is actively exploring smart contract functionality and native staking capabilities. These initiatives reflect changing market demands. The recent approval of XRP exchange-traded funds in the United States has intensified focus on the blockchain's technical capabilities. David Schwartz, Ripple's Chief Technology Officer and original XRP Ledger architect, confirmed evolving perspectives on network governance. His thinking about consensus models has shifted over time. Schwartz revealed ongoing considerations about XRP's role in decentralized finance. He examines both organic DeFi applications through platforms like Flare, MoreMarkets, Axelar, and Doppler, as well as native on-chain possibilities. The CTO indicated that current market conditions favor discussions about enhanced DeFi features. Programmability initiatives are already underway within the XRP development community. Schwartz suggested the timing is appropriate to explore additional native DeFi capabilities for XRP Ledger. These conversations could reshape the blockchain's technical roadmap. Recent milestones support this direction. XRP Ledger Smart Contracts launched on AlphaNet, a dedicated development network. This marks a significant step toward programmable functionality. The AlphaNet deployment allows developers to test smart contract features before mainnet implementation. This phased approach reduces risk while building developer confidence. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at around $2.19, suggesting a 0.25% increase in the last 24 hours.

Scott Bessent, who’s now running the Treasury Department, is the one handling interviews with the candidates. He confirmed Trump will be meeting all five of them soon. The shortlist includes current Fed governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, former governor Kevin Warsh, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, and Rick Rieder, who runs fixed income for BlackRock. Trump keeps dropping hints about Bessent, even though Bessent himself said twice last week that he doesn’t want the job. Hassett says Fed failed on inflation and wants deeper rate cuts Kevin Hassett is considered the top contender , according to Bloomberg. He already worked for Trump in the first administration and currently serves as director of the National Economic Council. Hassett told Yahoo Finance that he’s big on keeping the Fed independent, fixing the way interest rates are set, and cutting rates to match the economy. He slammed the Fed for calling inflation during the pandemic “transitory,” saying they made serious mistakes by acting too late. He also pointed out that the Fed hiked rates just after Trump’s tax cuts were passed, then decided to slash them again before the 2024 election.“I think they’ve made some bad policy decisions, and they’ve made policy decisions that look to me to be at times partisan,” Hassett said.“There’s a lot of house-cleaning needs to happen at the Federal Reserve.” Hassett agrees with Trump that rates could go “a lot lower” and warned against pausing rate cuts in December, citing the unknown impact of the government shutdown. He supports a full 50 basis point cut next month and said he would accept the job if offered. Jaret Seiberg from TD Cowen thinks Kevin Warsh might still have an edge, but agrees that Hassett remains a top option due to his frequent contact with the president. Christopher Waller, Seiberg said, could be a fallback pick if there’s a deadlock. “We would not describe any of the three leading contenders as traditional doves,” he said, noting that while they’ve all pushed for cuts, none are soft on inflation. “All three would risk a confrontation with Trump if inflation became a top concern.” Waller, Bowman, Warsh, Rieder bring experience; and rate cuts Christopher Waller, already a Fed board member, lines up closely with Trump on policy. He was the first one inside the central bank to call for a rate cut back in July. He now wants to cut again in December, saying the bigger threat is a slowing job market. He blames the drop in payroll growth mostly on lower demand, not just immigration. Waller said he doesn’t see signs of rising wages or quits, and thinks inflation, excluding tariffs, is almost back to 2%. He called tariffs a one-off price bump. He was nominated by Trump and worked as research director at the St. Louis Fed for over a decade. Waller told Fox Business that he spoke with Bessent about the job, saying, “I think they are looking for someone who has merit, experience, and knows what they are doing in the job, and I think I fit that.” Michelle Bowman, also appointed by Trump, now serves as vice chair of supervision. She supports rate cuts because she thinks the labor market is looking more fragile. She’s already penciled in three cuts for the year and is backing another one soon. Bowman’s been busy rewriting the bank playbook; she opposed Michael Barr’s Basel III plan, which would’ve raised capital requirements by 20%. She said that would “significantly harm the economy” and plans to drop a new version next year. She also reorganized the Fed’s supervision unit, cutting staff by around 30%, and changed how the biggest banks get rated. She’s leading a proposal to publish stress-test models used by the Fed, which banks like. Kevin Warsh once looked like the frontrunner earlier this year. He served on the Fed board from 2006 to 2011 and became Ben Bernanke’s main link to Wall Street during the 2008 crash. Trump had already interviewed him for this job once, eight years ago. Warsh recently attacked Jerome Powell for “unwise choices,” arguing that post-pandemic inflation came from overspending and money printing, not wage growth. Rick Rieder manages $2.4 trillion at BlackRock and sits on the Fed’s Investment Advisory Committee. He thinks a December cut is overdue. In a recent chat with Yahoo Finance, Rieder said inflation is still hot, but labor problems are becoming more urgent. If you take out health care jobs, he said job growth was actually negative through spring and summer. “I think that is something that is going to be persistent,” Rieder said. “Hopefully, the economy continues to be resilient, which I think it will … the economy’s in good shape, companies are in great shape, labor not so much.” Sharpen your strategy with mentorship + daily ideas - 30 days free access to our trading program",Economy|Federal Reserve|USD,EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-30 11:55:29

According to SoSoValue , Grayscale’s ETHE has now recorded a staggering –$4.93 billion in cumulative net redemptions, the largest outflow among all Ethereum-listed ETFs. While the broader ETH ETF market saw $76.5 million in daily net inflows, these gains were overshadowed by Grayscale’s selling pressure. US ETH Spot ETF – Source: Sosovalue ETHE’s 2.5% fee, far higher than competitors like BlackRock’s ETHA at 0.25%, continues to push legacy holders to exit positions. That process mirrors the heavy GBTC unwind that weighed on Bitcoin earlier this year. While BlackRock’s ETHA posted $68.27 million in daily inflows, the tug-of-war between ETHE’s redemptions and inflows elsewhere has left overall confidence fragile. Combined net ETF assets now stand near $19.15 billion, representing roughly 5.2% of Ethereum’s market capitalization. For traders, the message is clear: the structural demand is improving, but ETHE’s outflows remain the dominant headwind in the near term. Macro Sentiment Adds to Volatility Uncertainty across broader risk markets compounds the pressure. A cautious tone from the Federal Reserve, slowing liquidity conditions, and ongoing liquidation in leveraged crypto positions have encouraged investors to tread carefully. While institutional appetite for ETH exposure remains intact, particularly through BlackRock, Fidelity, and Bitwise, the rotation away from ETHE has created an uneven demand profile that ETH must work through before a sustained rally can emerge. In short, the ETF landscape is improving, but the recovery is uneven, and it shows on the charts. Ethereum (ETH/USD) Technical Outlook: Downtrend Still Dominant Ethereum price prediction is attempting to stabilize after a steep November decline, but its daily structure still leans bearish within a well-defined descending channel stretching from the $3,666 breakdown. ETH trades near $3,002, sitting just under the 20-day EMA at $3,087, which has capped every rebound for nearly a month. A daily close above this level would mark the first meaningful shift in momentum. The rebound from $2,632 is encouraging but not yet a trend reversal. Candles show hesitation, small bodies, mild upper wicks, and no strong engulfing signals. Meanwhile, the RSI has lifted from oversold 30 to around 40, showing easing bearish pressure but offering no bullish divergence yet. Ethereum Price Chart – Source: Tradingview TradingView’s projected path points toward a retest of $3,080–$3,120, followed by a potential rejection that could pull ETH back toward $2,632. A deeper decline exposes $2,192, the lower boundary of the channel and a key historical demand area. To flip bullish, ETH must break above the 20-EMA and then the channel ceiling near $3,300. A breakout there unlocks a move toward $3,666 and potentially $4,242. Outlook: A Breakout Could Trigger New Opportunities For now, patience is key. Traders will look for a higher low around $2,700 or a confirmed daily close above $3,120 to validate a recovery. If momentum flips decisively, Ethereum could be among the first majors to ignite a broader market rebound, a shift that historically channels fresh capital toward early-stage presale projects ready to benefit from the next expansion cycle. Maxi Doge: The Meme Coin Built for Maximum Hype Maxi Doge is exploding in popularity as traders rush toward its high-energy meme identity and fast-growing presale. With over $4.20 million raised, it’s quickly becoming one of the standout meme tokens of the year. The project mixes bold branding with real engagement features, from ROI contests to nonstop community events, giving it more personality and momentum than typical dog coins. Its shredded, leverage-obsessed mascot has already turned Maxi Doge into a recognizable culture coin. Holders can also stake $MAXI for daily smart-contract rewards and unlock access to exclusive competitions and partner events. The staking utility adds a passive-earning layer that keeps users active and invested in the ecosystem. With $MAXI priced at $0.00027 and the next increase approaching, the presale continues to gain speed. If you’re looking for a meme coin built on hype, personality, and real community energy, Maxi Doge is shaping up to be one worth watching.

In a statement on social media, Buterin stated that token voting is “flawed in many ways” and could lead to long-term erosion, especially for projects that prioritize privacy. Related News: BlackRock Makes Statement on Bitcoin: “Outflows Are Natural” Buterin issued a clear warning, saying, “I hope Zcash can resist the dark hand of token voting.” The Ethereum founder, stating that token voting is worse than the current Zcash governance model, also referenced his previous critique of the governance. He argued that the “median token holder” shaping decisions in token voting could lead to the devaluation of sensitive issues like privacy over time. While the Zcash ecosystem has been in the news in recent months with discussions about changes to its governance model, Buterin's position is particularly significant. He has previously stated that privacy-focused projects could move away from decentralization through token voting, and that this model would result in large wallets gaining ground. *This is not investment advice.

Even so, several structural developments within the crypto ecosystem continue to shape long-term expectations for the asset. Analysts and data models have increasingly evaluated how these changes could influence XRP’s valuation by 2031, resulting in a wide range of projections. Key Drivers Supporting Long-Term Optimism Several market developments have contributed to renewed interest in XRP’s long-term outlook. The introduction of the first XRP spot ETF, issued by Canary Capital under the ticker XRPC, represents one of the most significant recent milestones. Additional ETF products are expected to follow, potentially expanding institutional exposure to the asset. At the corporate level, companies such as Evernorth , VivoPower, and Trident Digital have announced positions in XRP for treasury management purposes. These actions suggest growing interest in utilizing XRP within formal financial structures. Regulatory conditions have also become more transparent in the United States and other jurisdictions, reducing uncertainty for institutional participants. Meanwhile, Ripple continues to expand its operational footprint through new partnerships , pilot programs, and acquisitions. These factors form the backdrop for several long-range estimations offered by both automated models and human analysts. Gemini’s Long-Term Scenarios for XRP To examine how XRP might perform by 2031 under varying market assumptions, the AI model Google Gemini assessed the influence of expanding institutional demand, regulatory clarity, and increased adoption of blockchain-based payment solutions. In one scenario, Gemini projected that XRP could reach the $50 to $75 range by the end of the decade if global ETF participation introduces significant capital inflows and if XRP secures a stronger position within the group of widely recognized digital assets. This possibility relies on steady progress in the asset’s use as a cross-border settlement tool. A second scenario focused on broader integration into international payments and corporate treasury operations. Under this outlook, XRP would capture a measurable portion of global remittances, foreign-exchange processing, and early central bank digital currency (CBDC) interoperability. Gemini estimated that such conditions could support valuations between $100 and $200 by 2031. The most ambitious scenario involved XRP becoming a widely adopted settlement instrument in institutional finance, accompanied by robust regulatory approval and increased participation from financial institutions. Gemini noted that this environment could push XRP above $500 and potentially near or above $1,000 , though it also stressed that substantial risks remain. Any unexpected regulatory, competitive, or market challenges could significantly undermine these projections. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Additional Forecasts from Market Analysts Outside of automated modeling, several analysts have offered independent projections. Forecasts from Changelly indicate that XRP could begin 2031 around $22, rise to approximately $31.46 midway through the year, and potentially close near $37.33. This estimate represents a comparatively measured outlook. Another perspective comes from market commentator 24HrsCrypto, who suggested in March 2025 that XRP could trade between roughly $92.59 and $185.19 by 2030, emphasizing the potential benefits of long-term holding strategies. Adding yet another angle, EasyA founders Phil and Dom Kwok suggested earlier in the year that XRP could reach $1,000 by 2030, stressing that the asset has not tapped the substantial growth within the decentralized finance sector. While opinions vary widely, the forecasts highlight one consistent theme: XRP’s long-term trajectory depends heavily on adoption, regulatory clarity, and its ability to deepen its role in emerging financial systems.

According to recent analysis, researchers have revealed that the country has accumulated research on artificial intelligence since the late 90s, focusing on pattern recognition, speech processing, and data optimization. According to reports, if North Korea were to leverage AI-based automation technologies, its cybercriminal activities, including crypto theft, money laundering, and fake identity creation, could be on the rise. While it has not utilized those high-end models, the reports claim that North Korean researchers have been partially using Nvidia graphics cards, including the GeForce RTX 2700, which has been subject to export restrictions. North Korea accused of using banned Nvidia GPUs to steal crypto According to Kim Min Jung, head of the Advanced Technology Strategy Center at the Institute for National Security Strategy (INSS), a National Intelligence Service think tank, there is a need to precisely monitor the country’s AI research trend and policy responses to suppress the military and cyber diversion of related technologies. He shared those thoughts in a report titled Analysis of North Korea’s AI Status and Policy Considerations. The report mentioned that North Korea has spent nearly 30 years building AI research capabilities that are centered on pattern recognition, data optimization, and speech processing. It mentioned that since the 2010s, North Korea has greatly improved its internal capacities through the expansion of research institutions and the development of its algorithms. The studies carried out this year focused on facial recognition and other aspects, including accent identification and multi-object tracking. These efforts were undertaken to improve accuracy and processing speed despite limited computational and data environments. These technologies could identify targets, predict movements, and improve efficiency in disrupting command communications or carrying out social engineering attacks. Some of the studies used the GeForce RTX 2700, which the United States Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has designated as a prohibited item to be exported into North Korea. Illicit funds continue to power weapons program The report claimed that such AI capabilities, including the production of deepfake material , evasion of detection, and improved crypto theft, are possible. In the past few years, North Korea has pushed resources into its nuclear and missile weapons programs amid international sanctions. Regarding digital asset theft, the report noted: “Utilizing high-performance AI computational resources could exponentially increase attack and theft attempts per unit time, enabling a small number of personnel to conduct operations with efficiency and precision comparable to industrial-scale efforts.” In the report, the cooperation between North Korea, China, and Russia was mentioned, noting that it has improved since the Ukraine war. The report cited it as a main variable that could accelerate the practical deployment of AI technologies. It emphasized the need to monitor and analyze North Korea’s AI application in several aspects. In addition, it added that while North Korea may be looking to expand its data center, there are no signs of using top-tier generative AI. Meanwhile, a previous report by AhnLab has fingered hacking group Lazarus as the suspect in over 31 cyberattacks in the past year. The report was widely circulated amid speculations that the group might be behind the recent breach at South Korean crypto exchange Upbit. The report claimed that aside from Lazarus, another North Korea-based group, Kimsuky, was second with 27 cases. However, in terms of countries, North Korea accounted for 86 incidents, while Russia followed at 27.

XRP slipped 1% on the day but continues to hold its position as the world’s fourth-largest cryptocurrency, backed by a market cap of nearly $132 billion. With 60.3 billion tokens circulating, investors are now debating whether XRP has the momentum to climb toward the much-discussed $5.50 target by late 2026. Market Structure Shows Signs of Stabilization XRP’s recent price behavior reflects a market trying to stabilize after months of pressure. The daily chart shows XRP repeatedly defending the $2.1458 zone, a level where long wick candles indicate steady buyer commitment. For a market that’s been trapped under a descending trendline since early October, this defense matters. It signals that sellers are losing their grip. The 20-day EMA flattening near $2.2026 adds another layer of support. It’s the first time in weeks that this trend filter isn’t pointing sharply downward, hinting that XRP may be preparing for a structural shift. Momentum remains soft, but the groundwork for a reversal is slowly forming. XRP/USD Triangle Compression Sets Up a December Breakout XRP price prediction is neutral as XRP is now coiling inside a tightening triangle pattern, a structure that typically precedes a notable breakout. Several Doji-style candles over the last week show hesitation, not weakness. Traders are waiting for a catalyst. XRP/USD Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The RSI sits near 47, a neutral position that leaves room for expansion in either direction. If XRP manages a clean daily close above the descending trendline, the first major test arrives at $2.3847. Clearing this level could unlock a move toward $2.5783, followed by a more ambitious push toward $2.78. Technical analysis points to a minor pullback toward $2.20–$2.23 first, allowing XRP to form a healthier higher low before charging at resistance. What It Means for Traders Heading Into 2026 The most attractive setup forms once XRP breaks, retests, and holds above the trendline. That structure provides a clearer runway toward higher levels, and opens the door to more aggressive targets in early 2026. If momentum strengthens alongside renewed liquidity across the crypto market, a march toward $5.50 becomes less far-fetched. With presale activity heating up and capital rotating back into high-beta assets, XRP’s next breakout may not only lift existing holders, it could also pull new investors into the broader market cycle. Maxi Doge: The Meme Coin Built for Maximum Hype Maxi Doge is exploding in popularity as traders rush toward its high-energy meme identity and fast-growing presale.
