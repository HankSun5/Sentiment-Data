Interestingly, CryptoQuant data now reveals that spot trading volume across exchanges reached $375 billion in November. Meanwhile, exchange-traded fund (ETF) volume climbed to nearly $35 billion. Institutional Money Pours In According to the analysis, Ethereum began the year with significant volatility in monthly trading activity, with total volume fluctuating between roughly $280 billion and $380 billion before accelerating sharply in the middle of the year. That surge eventually led to a peak of more than $599 billion in August, and marked the highest monthly trading volume recorded during the period. Following this spike, trading activity eased but stayed comparatively strong, and ended November at around $375 billion, a level that indicates continued market participation despite ongoing price pressures. CryptoQuant found that Binance remained the dominant venue for Ethereum trading, and recorded approximately $198 billion in spot trading volume during November alone. This figure underscores Binance’s central role in real-time liquidity flows and its position as the leading platform for both institutional and retail traders executing high-volume transactions. Data also shows that institutional interest played a meaningful role through regulated investment vehicles, with Ethereum spot ETFs registering about $35 billion in trading volume for the month. Such a level of ETF activity points to continued engagement from traditional market participants and adds an additional layer of “organized liquidity” to overall Ethereum market flows during the period. Currently, Ethereum is seeing renewed confidence from large investors as whale activity increasingly leans toward long positions, according to Alphractal’s Whale vs Retail Delta metric. On the price front, ETH has climbed above $3,000. Despite remaining around 24% lower over the month, the asset’s recovery coincided with aggressive accumulation from major holders. As recently reported by CryptoPotato, wallets holding 10,000-100,000 ETH now control a record level of over 21 million ETH, while entities with over 100,000 ETH have expanded their balance to around 4.3 million ETH. ETH Near Neutral Zone Further analysis reveals that Ethereum is trading near fair-value territory, as important on-chain indicators point to a sensitive phase in the market. Ethereum’s Realized Price stands at $2,315 and an MVRV ratio of 1.27. This places the asset in a neutral zone where the market price sits just 27% above the Realized Price, which shows neither overbought nor oversold conditions. Binance-specific data reflects an even sharper shift, as Ethereum’s MVRV ratio on the exchange hovers near 0.999, just below the historically important threshold of 1.0. A reading under 1 means that market capitalization is aligning with the Realized Price, pushing most investors into a “no-profit, no-loss” position. This zone has historically coincided with early market bottoms or extended periods of price weakness. On the other hand, long-term MVRV readings above 3 typically correspond with overbought phases, while values below 1 indicate market troughs characterized by unrealized losses. The current ratio of 1.27 points to a balanced market structure with no strong signals of extreme valuation.

In an interview with Altcoin Daily, he argued that many newly launched networks, despite attracting early investor attention, lack sustainable fundamentals and carry inflated valuations. Hayes emphasized that initial hype often creates short-term price gains but does not guarantee enduring success for these projects. Monad and the Risks of High-Valuation L1s Hayes specifically highlighted Monad, a recently launched L1 backed by Coinbase Ventures. At the time of his statement, MON token had risen 45% since its ICO, reaching roughly $0.037 with a market capitalization near $398 million. Despite these gains, Hayes expects a dramatic decline, citing the coin’s high fully diluted valuation and low circulating supply. He noted that many new L1s follow a pattern of early surges followed by sharp corrections, driven by initial investor optimism rather than fundamental value. According to Hayes, new L1 projects often attract attention because investors hope to discover the next Ethereum. Early pumps create excitement, but most tokens fail to maintain momentum once hype fades. Venture capital support may temporarily prop up prices, but Hayes warned that this does not guarantee long-term success. Consequently, he believes most L1 tokens outside Ethereum and Solana are destined for collapse. Ethereum and Solana: The Standout Networks Despite the challenges facing newer L1s, Hayes identifies Ethereum and Solana as exceptions. He sees Ethereum as the foundation for institutional blockchain adoption. Large banks and organizations now prefer public networks over private chains due to security and utility advantages. Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism will help Ethereum scale while maintaining privacy, positioning it for sustained growth. Solana, according to Hayes, remains the second-largest L1, benefiting previously from meme coin activity. However, he acknowledges that meme-driven growth has slowed. Solana will need a new catalyst to maintain user engagement and price momentum. While Hayes remains skeptical that it will surpass Ethereum, he believes the network will continue to play a significant role in the blockchain ecosystem. Hayes’ Magnificent Five In addition to Ethereum and Solana, Hayes named Bitcoin, Zcash, and Ethena as his top cryptocurrency picks. These networks combine adoption, security, and practical utility, which he considers critical for long-term success. By contrast, most other L1 tokens face a high risk of decline as early enthusiasm fades.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|SOL|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-29 19:50:13

The momentum is gaining traction at an accelerated pace, and the preliminary indications are that this project could be among the best cryptocurrencies to follow in the coming 2026. As the demand is growing by the day, there are several traders who are worried about not getting one of the most desired early performances of the year. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building two lending markets in its protocol. P2C Lending: Under its derivative services called Peer-to-Contracts, buyers can post assets and earn mtTokens, which are equivalent to deposits for them and generate APY as borrowers use them. As an example, a person who provides $1,000 of USDC may be issued several mtUSDC, the value of which increases with the payment of interest by borrowers. The yield also depends on demand, and therefore, the more the borrowers the more the APY of the suppliers. P2P Marketplace: Mutuum Finance is also developing a Peer-to-peer marketplace and the users get to create single borrowing agreements. The rates are based on utilization and risk. Borrowers have options on whether to accept variable or in certain cases stable rates in case they want to have known costs on repaying loans. Loan to Value restrictions insure positions. The LTVs of lower-volatility investments such as the ETF remain at an average of 75%, whereas more aggressive prices remain only at 35%-40%. In case the value of collateral is low, the protocol causes the liquidation. Liquidators purchase collateral at a discount and redeem some of the debt held by the borrower, and this is to take care of system losses. Presale Progress, Funding Milestones and Demand Since it was launched in the beginning of 2025, momentum has been fast-paced at Mutuum Finance. The initial price was at $0.01 and now it is $0.035 with the price value increasing by 250%. The initial price is established as $0.06, which could imply a good increase in the price when the demand is maintained. The project has gathered a total of $19M funds and over 18,200 holders. Out of 4B supply of tokens, the presale has been allotted 45.5% which equals to 1.82B tokens. Of the same, 800M tokens are already owned. The momentum is high and Phase 6 is at the last leg with allocation standing at high above 92%. Mutuum Finance also operates a 24 hour leaderboard where the leader each day gets $500 in MUTM as a prize. This promotes the incessant use and assists in attracting new users into the system. The card payments also make participation possible in presale since buyers can immediately participate without any supplementary actions. The prelaunch crypto demand keeps gaining momentum with more and more traders seeking the most favorable crypto to purchase before launch. The window to enter at $0.035 is closing quicker than projected. V1 Check Mutuum Finance has assured using the official X account that the V1 of the protocol will launch on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. The initial one will consist of a liquidity pool, mtToken mechanisms, a debt-tracking token, and the liquidation bot. ETH and USDT will be accommodated initially. Another significant highlight is security. Mutuum Finance underwent a CertiK audit with a 90/100 Token Scan rating, with a thorough review of the lending and borrowing agreements currently being done by Halborn Security . This essay analyzes that a powerful audit, solid product roadmap, and fast presale growth, combined, might potentially put MUTM in one of the strongest early moves in 2026. According to the commentators in the market, it can further increase above $0.06 launch price in case the demand keeps rising considering the increased interest by the whale buyers. Layer-2 Expansion and Why It Matters The team is also gearing towards adding layer-2 expansion and seek to deploy on chains characterized by a lower fee and increased throughput. The reason behind this is that in cases where borrowing and lending are easy and inexpensive, DeFi platforms expand. Increased L2 coverage may also increase the number of total users and enhance liquidity. Such measures are important since users who seek to know what crypto to invest their money tend to select those projects that already display extensive planning rather than just through marketing or hype. Mutuum Finance possesses physical infrastructure in place, defined security level, and various avenues to grow upon the launching. Cash is flowing within investors and is moving fast with Phase 6 approaching a total of 100% sellout. Having increased its price by 250%, powerful DeFi mechanics, solid roadmap, large audits, plans of a layer-2, and growing purchasing force, Mutuum Finance is turning out to be among the most popular cryptocurrencies in 2026.

Monero is an attractive investment because it emphasizes privacy and security, utilizing advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure transaction confidentiality, which has created a strong demand in the market . Its growing adoption across various use cases and a decentralized development model enhance its long-term potential. With a limited supply and increasing investor interest, Monero offers a unique opportunity for those seeking financial autonomy and privacy to invest in cryptocurrency. However, investors should remain cautious of regulatory risks and market volatility when considering Monero as part of their portfolio, making it essential to seek investment advice. Why is XMR up? Monero price analysis shows that XMR saw a swift rise to the $407 mark before falling back to the $385 mark where it found support to continue the rally to the current $410 mark. Will XMR recover to its all-time high? Monero is expected to recover toward its all-time high of $518 by mid-2026 as the privacy chain continues to reduce its tech debt and progresses toward greater utility and privacy. However, the platform might have to overcome regulatory scrutiny and challenges before it can see mass adoption, as it remains highly speculative . How much will Monero be worth in 5 years? The Monero price prediction for 2030 suggests a minimum price of $1,048.76 and an average trading price of $1,142.11 . The maximum forecasted price is set at $1,208.35. Will XMR reach $1000? The chances of Monero (XMR) hitting $1,000 hinge on various factors, which will influence its future price movements. The adoption of privacy transactions and technological advances could increase demand. Favorable regulations and market sentiment toward privacy coins would also help. Yet, regulatory risks, competition, and market volatility are challenges that monero traders could face could hinder significant growth. $1,000 is possible with favorable conditions, especially considering the current price but market dynamics and regulations will shape its path. Does XMR have a good long-term future? Monero (XMR) has the potential for a strong long-term future due to its focus on privacy and security, which makes it attractive to users seeking anonymity. However, many investors have concerns regarding privacy, regulatory scrutiny, and notoriety from being the favored medium for some past criminals, which impact the current Monero sentiment. Monero’s commitment to ring confidential transactions and privacy gives it a solid foundation for long-term growth, but it must carefully navigate market and regulatory landscapes.

The highest price was $278.56, and the lowest was $114.16. In January 2024, Monero stayed stable around the $150.00 mark as market momentum remained low. However, the stability was short-lived as February crashed to $101.95. However, XMR showed swift recovery as it closed the month near the $150.00 level again. In March and April 2024, XMR saw a steady decline from $150.00 to $120.00, where it found key support. In May 2024, XMR observed steady bullish pressure as the price rose from $120.00, approaching resistance at $150.

In July, the crypto traded around the $155 mark as the price volatility remained relatively low. XMR opened trading at $156.05 in August and ended the month at $176.00, making remarkable gains. September was bearish for the asset, as the price declined below the $160 mark by the end of the month. In October, Monero observed a steep crash and has been making a swift recovery since then.

During June the price continued to observe high volatility but observed low net change as the asset closed the month around $313.

He linked gold’s long history as a neutral asset to the rise of XRP. He shared a video where gold wholesaler Chris Olson spoke on Tucker Carlson’s show. Olson discussed government control over wealth. Aljarrah explained why he views gold and XRP as aligned with personal sovereignty. He views XRP as a neutral bridge , playing a role similar to gold in the digital age. Gold is the only form of freedom that has survived every collapse. Neutral. Answers to no government. Answers to no bank. XRP is the evolution of that same principle, a neutral bridge for a digital world. If you understand sovereignty, you hold both. pic.twitter.com/gnqFn03KSF — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) November 28, 2025 A Focus on Control Olson’s remarks created a direct contrast between individual autonomy and the modern tax system. He said, “We were a free country once,” while describing the current approach to income reporting. He argued that the state views earnings as a resource to be managed rather than a private matter. His view centered on the claim that the government chooses to use the people as a source of revenue. He then pointed out how much time citizens work each year to meet their IRS obligations. He linked that burden to foreign policy spending that many taxpayers do not support. This argument fits Aljarrah’s point. The concern is not about ordinary taxation. It is about a structure that can hinder families’ ability to protect assets or build long-term stability. Olson said the system does not let families preserve and transmit generational wealth. Why Aljarrah Connects Gold and XRP While some analysts believe XRP can replicate Gold’s market performance , Aljarrah sees a deeper connection. He framed gold as a form of freedom that has survived every collapse. He described it as neutral and outside the reach of both governments and banks. He then presented XRP as the digital evolution of that idea. He described XRP as a neutral bridge suited for the global movement of value. The message linked physical and digital stores of value. The comparison reflects a view held by many XRP supporters. XRP does not grant governments the ability to freeze or reverse transactions at the protocol level. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Even Ripple has no control over XRP . It moves value across borders in seconds without relying on traditional banking rails. This structure matches the principle Olson defended in his interview. It favors systems that let individuals operate without unnecessary oversight. XRP’s Role Today Olson’s remarks on state control highlight why many view XRP as a neutral asset. XRP offers fast settlement, low cost, and clear user control. Aljarrah links it to Gold as a tool for personal autonomy. He sees XRP as a direct, sovereign option for a digital financial system. According to Aljarrah, anyone who understands sovereignty holds both gold and XRP. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Expert Answers,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/whats-going-on-behind-the-scenes-with-xrp-expert-answers/,"Conversations around XRP have grown louder in recent weeks as the cryptocurrency continues to trade around the $2.2 region while new Spot XRP ETFs continue to attract inflows across multiple issuers. One voice in the community has attempted to explain why the market is unusually calm despite rising institutional demand. An XRP enthusiast known as Pumpius shared a detailed thread on X that breaks down the mechanics behind the new ETFs and why the real impact may still be ahead. His argument is that the current XRP price action does not yet reflect what is going on behind the scenes. Related Reading: Bitcoin Maxi Says ATH Back On The Table After 40x Derivatives Surge Why ETF Rules Create A Special Market Dynamic Pumpius explained that the foundation of the entire setup is in one legal detail with fund managers. ETF fund managers are restricted from purchasing XRP directly from Ripple or from the escrow accounts that hold large reserves of the token. Every ETF must source XRP through open-market purchases, without private deals or wholesale arrangements. The absence of direct acquisition forces institutional buyers into the same liquidity pool as retail and whales. With the new launch of XRP ETFs, and as demand continues to rise, the circulating supply is now the battleground, and this mechanical pressure is already visible in recent weeks as XRP trading volumes climbed while exchange supply began trending downward. According to market trackers, XRP supply on major exchanges has declined steadily since the approval of the first Spot XRP ETFs, showing that the stress on available liquidity is not theoretical but active. Particularly, data from CryptoQuant shows that Binance’s XRP reserves are now at their lowest point in months, having dropped to 2.7 billion tokens this week. Incoming Supply Squeeze For XRP Another part of the explanation focuses on Ripple’s behavior regarding escrow releases. Although one billion XRP is unlocked each month, Ripple has repeatedly returned about 700 million to 800 million of these unlocked tokens back into escrow. Ripple releases only what it considers necessary to maintain healthy liquidity in the ecosystem, and the company has avoided significant selling pressure since the ETF approvals. According to Pumpius, this means the ecosystem is operating in a controlled balance where ETF issuers are absorbing a growing share of the circulating float, while Ripple keeps escrow output extremely conservative. The result is a slow tightening of supply that’s happening behind the scenes and may not yet be visible in price action but can eventually cause what he called a structural supply shock. When this happens, XRP will not move slowly, but it will break price levels with impact.

Its iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) recorded significant outflows in the week from November 21 to November 28, 2025, totaling $113.70 million. On November 21, the ETF saw an outflow of $122 million, followed by another $149.1 million on November 22. The next two days brought some relief, with inflows of $83 million on November 23 and $61.5 million on November 24. However, this brief recovery was overshadowed by a sharp outflow on November 25, pushing the total net outflow for the week to $113.7 million. Despite the mix of inflows and outflows, the net negative movement remains a red flag. After outflows of $271.1 million in the first two days, the inflows that followed were not enough to offset the heavy losses. Bitcoin ETFs inflows. Source: Coinglass Indeed, the outflows are likely to add more pressure to Bitcoin’s price, which is struggling to maintain the $90,000 support zone. Even so, on-chain data suggests the asset may see sustained gains in the coming days. Bitcoin shows signs of market bottom In this case, data shared by Ali Martinez in a November 29 X post shows Bitcoin nearing a key “low-risk” zone based on its Sharpe Ratio, a measure of risk-adjusted returns. Historically, when this ratio dips into the green band, it has coincided with discounted prices and strong accumulation periods for long-term investors .

This is an area that often offers solid opportunities for dip buyers. pic.twitter.com/0XAMkFKrTP — Ali (@ali_charts) November 29, 2025 The latest data indicates a sharp drop in the Sharpe Ratio, mirroring past cycles that preceded major recoveries. Bitcoin’s price has also softened, pulling back from recent highs and approaching levels that typically attract dip buyers. While the indicator doesn’t guarantee a market bottom, its move toward the low-risk zone has often signaled favorable long-term entry points as sentiment cools and risk metrics reset.

While the project is seeing massive institutional interest, with ETF inflows topping $527 million , its price is struggling to break past key resistance around the $144 mark. Now, a new proposal to cut staking rewards is raising questions about its long-term decentralization. GeeFi has set a new benchmark for early-stage momentum after selling 10 million tokens and fully closing Phase 1 in a little over a week . Thousands of investors moved in fast, recognizing the potential behind GeeFi’s advanced, utility-packed DeFi wallet. Phase 2 has already begun with a 20% price uplift , and analysts expect this phase to wrap up rapidly, given the intense demand. Immediately after Phase 3 fills, the price jumps another 20% , meaning every delay costs potential upside. GeeFi’s Clear Path GeeFi offers a solution by focusing on a self-sustaining ecosystem that rewards its users directly. With its non-custodial wallet , you maintain full control over your assets. GeeFi is building a platform where you can earn through clear and tangible methods. Its upcoming staking program, for example, is projected to offer an impressive APR of up to 55% . This provides a dependable source of passive income that isn’t reliant on speculative market trends or institutional sentiment. A Presale Opportunity with Explosive Momentum The excitement around GeeFi is growing rapidly. The project sold all 10 million of its Phase 1 tokens, raising $500,000 in just 12 days . An incredible $320,000 of that was raised in the last week alone, showing a massive acceleration in demand. Now in Phase 2, the GEE token is priced at $0.06 , but the opportunity for huge returns remains. With a listing price of $0.40 already planned, investors who buy now are looking at a guaranteed return of 667% . Analysts are forecasting that GeeFi could become a $2 project. This means a $600 investment today could turn into $20,000 , delivering a remarkable 3,233% ROI . Given the rapid pace of Phase 1, experts predict Phase 3 could begin in just 3 weeks , so the window to get in at this price is closing fast. Your All-in-One Hub for Crypto Management GeeFi is creating an integrated platform to make every part of your crypto experience easier. The GeeFi HUB will serve as a central command center for managing all your digital assets. It will connect directly with the GeeFi DEX , a decentralized exchange designed for fast, secure, and low-cost trading across multiple blockchains. This design directly addresses the common frustrations of high fees and complicated interfaces found on many other platforms. With the GeeFi HUB and DEX, you can manage your portfolio, keep track of your NFTs, and swap tokens without any hassle. It is a full suite of tools built to give you more power and control, making crypto management both direct and affordable. An Ecosystem Built to Reward Its Community At the core of the project is the GeeFi Wallet , which is already available for Android , with an iOS version coming soon. It supports over 14 networks , letting you manage all of your crypto assets in one secure and convenient location. The GeeFi Team has been working on this platform since 2023 , providing consistent updates that demonstrate their commitment to a long-term vision. GeeFi also rewards its community for helping it expand. Through a simple referral program, you can earn a 5% bonus in GEE tokens for every purchase made with your unique link. While Solana’s future depends on unpredictable market forces, GeeFi is building a project with real utility and sharing its success with its supporters from the very beginning. With excitement growing and investors pouring in, the presale is transforming into a race rather than an opportunity. Those who wait too long may find themselves chasing a price that keeps moving higher.

Nearly every top platform reported massive outflows, signaling potential shifts in user behavior and institutional strategies. Analysts note that the total XRP held on exchanges has fallen sharply, suggesting either large-scale withdrawals, migration to self-custody, or internal rebalancing. The total exchange-held XRP dropped to 15.86 billion, a decline of 6.5 billion XRP since February, representing a 29% decrease. Upbit experienced a 6.22 billion XRP outflow, while Binance saw 2.56 billion XRP leave the platform. Bithumb followed with 1.77 billion XRP withdrawn. Other major exchanges, including Uphold, eToro, Bybit, and Bitbank, reported roughly 50% balance drops. These figures suggest that users are increasingly moving assets off exchanges, possibly into personal wallets or cold storage solutions. Meanwhile, a few platforms bucked the trend, Evernorth gained 13.36%, Coincheck saw an influx of 550 million XRP, and OKX reported a striking 10,107% spike, likely due to address reclassification. Conversely, some exchanges faced extreme declines. Coinbase lost 99.97% of its XRP holdings since February, while KuCoin, Paribu, and SwissBorg recorded near-total exits. The widespread reduction in exchange balances highlights a possible reshuffling event that could have long-term implications for XRP liquidity and market dynamics. 21Shares XRP ETF Set to Trade on Monday This liquidity shift coincides with the upcoming launch of the 21Shares U.S. spot XRP ETF, set to trade under the ticker TOXR on Monday. The ETF will track the CME CF XRP-Dollar Reference Rate, allowing investors exposure to XRP’s spot price without holding the cryptocurrency directly. The U.S. market has seen a flurry of XRP ETF activity in recent days, including launches from Grayscale and Franklin Templeton. Early trading of these ETFs shows strong demand, with GXRP and XRPZ capturing $67.36 million and $62.59 million in flows on their first days, respectively. Technical Outlook: Key Levels to Watch Source: X As of press time, XRP’s price rose 0.75% in the last 24 hours, trading at $2.19 , with a 7-day gain of 13.61% and a market cap of $132 billion. According to EGRAG CRYPTO analysis, closing above $2.60 could signal bullish momentum, while surpassing $3.40 would indicate strong upward trends. Conversely, a close below the 21 EMA may mark a bearish reversal. Analysts emphasize monitoring these levels for signs of sustained market strength. Conclusion XRP’s recent exchange outflows, combined with the launch of the 21Shares ETF, indicate a transformative period for liquidity and investor behavior.

This unprecedented surge in digital commerce represents a 9% increase from last year’s $10.8 billion, signaling that Black Friday has firmly established itself as a dominant e-commerce moment. How Did Black Friday Online Spending Reach Record Levels? The numbers tell a compelling story of digital transformation. Between 10am and 2pm on Black Friday, online shoppers were spending an incredible $12.5 million every minute. Adobe Analytics, which tracks more than 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail websites, confirmed this represents a new benchmark for holiday shopping. The data reveals that consumers are increasingly opting to shop from home rather than brave crowded stores, fundamentally changing how Americans approach the biggest shopping day of the year. What Do These Holiday Shopping Trends Reveal About Consumer Behavior? The record-breaking Black Friday performance provides crucial insights into broader holiday shopping patterns. Adobe projects total holiday spending will reach $253.4 billion this year, up from $241.1 billion in 2024. However, the growth story has important nuances: Salesforce tracked $79 billion in global Black Friday spending, with $18 billion coming from the United States Year-over-year increases of 6% globally and 3% in the U.S. Higher prices accounted for much of the growth, with prices up 7% on average Actual order volumes decreased by 1%, suggesting consumers are spending more per item How Is E-commerce Evolving During Peak Shopping Seasons? The e-commerce landscape is undergoing rapid transformation, with Cyber Monday expected to surpass even Black Friday’s impressive numbers. According to Reuters, Adobe projects $14.2 billion in online spending for Cyber Monday, continuing the trend of digital dominance during the holiday season. This represents a significant shift from traditional brick-and-mortar shopping, though the data on in-store traffic presents a mixed picture: Data Source In-Store Traffic Change Key Findings RetailNext Down 3.4% nationwide Overall decline in physical store visits Pass_by Up 1.17% overall Department stores saw 7.9% increase The Rising Impact of AI Shopping on Holiday Commerce Both Adobe and Salesforce report seeing growing AI influence on holiday shopping behavior. Salesforce revealed that between Thanksgiving and Black Friday, AI and AI agents influenced $22 billion in global sales. While the exact definition of “AI influence” remains somewhat unclear, this represents a significant development in how technology is shaping consumer decisions and shopping patterns. The integration of AI into e-commerce platforms is creating more personalized shopping experiences, helping consumers find deals faster and making recommendations based on browsing behavior and purchase history. This technological advancement is likely contributing to the efficiency of online shopping and the record-breaking spending numbers. What Does This Mean for the Future of Retail? The record Black Friday online spending of $11.8 billion signals a permanent shift in consumer behavior. Several key trends are emerging: Digital Dominance: Online shopping continues to capture larger shares of holiday spending Price Sensitivity: Higher prices are driving dollar growth while volume decreases AI Integration: Artificial intelligence is becoming a significant factor in shopping decisions Timing Matters: Peak shopping hours generate massive concentrated spending The transformation of Black Friday from a primarily in-store event to a major e-commerce moment reflects broader changes in retail. As consumers become more comfortable with digital shopping and technology continues to evolve, we can expect these trends to accelerate in coming years. Frequently Asked Questions How does Adobe Analytics track online spending data? Adobe Analytics monitors more than 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail websites, providing comprehensive insights into e-commerce trends and consumer behavior across the digital shopping landscape. What companies provide holiday shopping data beyond Adobe? Salesforce also tracks global shopping trends, reporting $79 billion in worldwide Black Friday spending with detailed analysis of price changes and order volumes across different markets and retail sectors. How is AI influencing holiday shopping according to the data? Salesforce data indicates that AI and AI agents influenced approximately $22 billion in global sales between Thanksgiving and Black Friday, though the specific mechanisms and definitions of AI influence continue to evolve as the technology becomes more integrated into e-commerce platforms. What’s the difference between Black Friday and Cyber Monday projections? While Black Friday set a record at $11.8 billion, Adobe projects Cyber Monday will reach $14.2 billion in online spending, reflecting the continued growth of digital commerce and changing consumer shopping patterns throughout the holiday weekend. How do in-store shopping trends compare to online growth? Data from RetailNext shows a 3.4% decline in nationwide in-store traffic, while Pass_by reports a 1.17% overall increase with department stores seeing a significant 7.9% boost, indicating varied performance across different retail formats and locations.

55115942,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=869944,1764453600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/55115942.jpeg,"The New Crypto Dominating Q4 2025, Only 6% Tokens Under $0.04 Remain",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/the-new-crypto-dominating-q4-2025-only-6-tokens-under-0-04-remain/,"It is being overtaken by a new cryptocurrency in the last quarter of 2025 and the demand is increasing at a faster rate than many had anticipated. As 6% of its existing token issue remains outstanding at less than half a $0.08, investors are scrambling to lay hands on their positions before the next crypto market leap. The pace is picking up day by day and it is prematurely believed that this project can be the best one to purchase currently as more and more interest is generated in the market. Explosive Presale at Mutuum Finance One of the best presales of the year has been by Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . When the presale was opened in early 2025, the token was priced at $0.01. It now costs $0.035, which is a 250% increase in token appreciation. The rise has been gradual and not abrupt as perceived by many traders. The presale occupies 1.82 billion tokens (45.5%) of the total supply of 4B. Over 800 million tokens have already been sold. Mutuum Finance has already raised over $19M and has over 18,200 holders, which makes it one of the most active new cryptocurrency offerings in 2025. Phase 6 is in the final stages, and it is already allocated over 94%, and only a minor percentage of tokens is left at the current price. The high demand rate is one of the reasons why investors seeking the best cryptocurrency to invest today are putting MUTM under their watch. Mutuum Finance and What It Is Building Mutuum Finance is developing a flexible and yield-efficient protocol of lending and borrowing, which is decentralised. The system aims at providing users with greater liquidity control and allowing a safer way of borrowing and more predictable returns. The central concept of the platform is the use of mtTokens, with which users are rewarded when they post assets to the protocol. These tokens increase in value as the borrowers repay interest, which is comparable to the yield bearing receipt of deposits. The design assists in making the interests of the suppliers and the borrowers to match without the use of basic staking rewards. A buy-and-distribute model also helps Long-term value at Mutuum Finance. A part of the protocol revenue is used to buy MUTM on the open market, and MUTM on the open market is redistributed to users that stake mtTokens in the safety module. This provides pressure to purchase continuously and compensate the active users as the platform increases. The issue of security has been a primary interest since the beginning. The project underwent a CertiK audit where the score was 90/100 Token Scan and Halborn Security is looking into lending and borrowing contracts. Having already finalized code, this stage of transparency gives comfort to the early investors and contributes to the development of trust concerning the long-term perspectives of the project. V1 Launch, Whale Activity and Increasing Urgency As indicated in the official account of Mutuum Finance V1 protocol, the release of the protocol is set on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. The initial version will consist of a working liquidity pool, mtTokens, a debt-tracking token, and the liquidation bot. There will be support of ETH and USDT at the launch. The existence of a working protocol in the presence of the token lists enhances the likelihood of the existence of an early exchange visibility, which may become a trigger to more interest and a purchasing triumph. It has been observed that the activities of the whale are on the increase with Phase 6 nearing its end. There are recent significant allocations such as buys of more than $100K which indicate that there is a lot of confidence in this project on its long-term vision. When large investors join in the last phases of a presale, it is usually an indication of active demand. The number of tokens below $0.04 is shrinking at a 6% rate, and there is always a sense of urgency. Investors who seek the best cryptocurrency to invest in at the moment are fast mounting their horses as the countenance at $0.035 narrows by day. As soon as Phase 6 is fully allocated, the following step will increase the entry price, and there will be no likelihood to purchase MUTM lower than $0.04. Supported by a booming presale, robust security bases, plans to launch stablecoins, oracle infrastructure, whales and an almost full Phase 6, Mutuum Finance now applies to Q4 2025. The early investors have only a meager percentage of tokens remaining at 0.035 and the clock is running out on them. The supply will dwindle at any time as long as the demand remains at this rate.

The flagship cryptocurrency is now trading above $90,000, with hopes building for a potential push back toward its all-time high of $126,100. Notably, popular market analyst KillaXBT has flagged a key price zone that could serve as the next target in this relieving market recovery. Related Reading: Bitcoin Must Break Key Supply Clusters To Regain ATH Momentum – Watch These Levels Bitcoin Headed To $95k-$96k, But Price Pullback May Occur First – Analyst In an X post on November 28, KillaXBT shares some compelling insights on Bitcoin’s price condition, highlighting both bullish and bearish tendencies. Following the asset’s gain of 7.22% in the past week, the analyst predicts that market bulls are likely to drive prices to around $95,000-$96,000, which contains strong, heavy illiquidity pockets and several liquidation clusters. For context, these zones are attractive to price because they contain large concentrations of resting orders, making them high-value liquidity targets. Liquidation clusters, in particular, hold groups of leveraged positions that trigger forced buying or selling once the price reaches them, injecting fresh liquidity into the market. However, KillaXBT cautions that this upside move may not occur immediately, noting that the market often delays sweeping major liquidity zones ahead of key macro events. With the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting expected to deliver clarity on potential rate cuts, traders may see continued liquidity building below the yearly open in the near term. According to the analyst, these upper liquidation levels are still likely to be cleared, but the timing could align more closely with next month’s policy announcement rather than the current market cycle. The analyst outlines a potential scenario in which Bitcoin experiences a minor pullback to around $93,000 before retesting $89,200. From there, the asset could move toward the $95,000–$96,000 target, in line with expectations for a potential FOMC rate adjustment. However, KillaXBT also highlights the possibility that Bitcoin may reach these key liquidation zones before the FOMC meeting. In such a scenario, the market could see a rapid surge to $96,000, followed by a sharp drop to around $89,200 due to potential liquidations, before eventually returning to these upper liquidity zones. Following this analysis, KillaXBT is opting for a short position, which he intends to reassess in relation to market trends as the FOMC approaches. Interestingly, the analyst believes the real short-term opportunity only comes after the FOMC’s announcement. Related Reading: Bitcoin STH Loss Transfers Fall 80% From Peak – What Comes Next?

According to the organization, these criminal hubs often lure victims with promises of high-paying overseas jobs before coercing them into compounds where they are forced to carry out schemes ranging from voice phishing and romance scams to investment fraud and cryptocurrency fraud targeting individuals worldwide. While not everyone working in these centres is trafficked, Interpol noted that those held against their will frequently face brutal conditions, including physical violence, torture, sexual exploitation, and rape. Global Crisis The resolution comes amidst growing use of advanced technologies by criminal networks to deceive victims and conceal their operations. As part of a coordinated plan for joint action, Interpol has outlined several measures to strengthen international law enforcement efforts, including real-time intelligence sharing to identify perpetrators and pinpoint locations, multinational joint operations supported by Interpol, targeted action against criminal financing and illicit assets linked to scam networks, and standardized emergency protocols to rescue and repatriate victims alongside expanded support services. Interpol Secretary General Valdecy Urquiza said , “To effectively counter these criminal networks, we must strengthen collaboration, improve information sharing, and move forward with coordinated, decisive action. INTERPOL is committed to supporting the resolution’s implementation and working with member countries to break these operations apart and protect the people who are most at risk.” The resolution also calls for global awareness campaigns directed at vulnerable groups, particularly youth and job seekers. Interpol said the threat has grown sharply, while pointing to its June crime trend update that reveals victims from more than 60 countries have been trafficked into scam centres operating well beyond Southeast Asia. Criminal activities have been found to be increasingly overlapping with drug, firearms, and wildlife trafficking. In 2024, Interpol led its largest-ever global operation against trafficking-driven fraud across 116 countries and territories, which resulted in more than 2,500 arrests, alongside additional regional operations in Africa and Europe. The organization first drew attention to the rise of scam centres in 2022 with a Purple Notice warning of social media recruitment tactics, followed by a 2023 Orange Notice which identified trafficking-fuelled fraud as a serious and imminent threat to public safety. Interpol Targets Big Names in Crypto Crime The resolution emerges as Interpol continues to pursue several high-profile individuals tied to alleged crypto-related crimes around the world. For instance, in 2022, the organization issued a Red Notice for Terraform Labs co-founder and CEO Do Kwon following the collapse of the Terra ecosystem. In July 2024, Hong Kong native and cryptocurrency promoter Wong Ching-kit was added to Interpol’s alert system for his suspected involvement in multiple criminal cases, including a cryptocurrency scam of more than $384,310. And in December 2024, Richard Schueler, better known as Richard Heart, founder of the Hex cryptocurrency, was listed under a Red Notice at the request of Finnish authorities over allegations of tax fraud and assault.

Fresh market data reveals that buying and selling pressure is no longer evenly distributed throughout the day, with the United States emerging as the key source of support. At the same time, other regions struggle to regain a solid footing. US Traders Fuel Bitcoin, Ethereum, And XRP Price Recovery Bitcoin’s market has moved once again as fresh on-chain data shows a clear divide in buying and seeking across global trading hours. A recent shift in US trading activity has had a noticeable impact on the broader crypto market. Ethereum and XRP, which experienced a sharp decline in previous weeks, have begun to stabilize and show mild recovery as Bitcoin strengthens during US hours. Currently, the price of BTC is above $90,000 after crashing below $87,000 earlier in the week. Ethereum has also reclaimed the $3,000 level and is now trading steadily above it. XRP has recorded the most weekly increase between the two, jumping approximately 14% according to CoinMarketCap, with its price presently around $2.18. While these cryptocurrencies have yet to regain all lost ground, renewed buying from US traders has helped ease the downward momentum that dominated in previous weeks. Sharing a new session-based chart from Velo, market analyst Ted Pillows disclosed that the US has reemerged as a net buyer of Bitcoin. At the same time, Asia remains the primary source of selling pressure throughout the year. This regional imbalance has reshaped the latest price movements of Ethereum and XRP, which tend to follow Bitcoin’s upward trajectory . The latest figures from Velo support this view. Velo’s Bitcoin session chart shows that US trading hours, which had been in negative territory earlier in the week, climbed steadily into positive territory from November 24 to date. The blue line representing US hours rose from just above 2% to 3.73% on November 24 before reaching 7.55% by November 26. This reflects a gain of more than 4% over the period, confirming a strong resurgence in demand from US traders. Europe Remains Uneven While Asia Leads Bitcoin Selling European trading hours, highlighted by the purple line, have been more uneven than those of the US. Europe rose to 1.67% on November 24 and briefly pushed higher to 3.31% later that day. This surge comes after the cumulative weekly return fell into negative territory from November 21, and while a slight recovery followed, it still ended the week below the flat line. This suggests that despite weak buying momentum, Europe may no longer be delivering the heavy selling pressure seen earlier. On the other hand, Asia continues to lag behind both regions. Velo’s chart shows that the APAC trading session , represented by the yellow line, started in slightly positive territory around November 20 but turned negative soon after. For most of the week, the regions remained between -5% and -7%. This persistent weakness signals a continuation of the year-long pattern in which Asian hours have been the leading driver of Bitcoin’s sell-side pressure.

The premier cryptocurrency seems to be on a recovery path, returning above the $90,000 mark on Wednesday, November 26. Despite the several calls of the bear market in recent weeks, the crowd has returned with hopes of the BTC bull run resuming. However, a prominent on-chain analyst has come forward with an interesting analysis of the current Bitcoin price outlook. BTC Price To Continue Within $70,000 – $90,000 Zone: Analyst In a November 28 post on the X platform, CryptoOnchain shared an evaluation of Bitcoin’s current price action around the $90,000 level. According to the crypto pundit, recent on-chain data suggests that the market leader is at risk of a rejection at its current price level. Related Reading: Fed To End QT In December: Will Bitcoin Mirror The Massive Price Crash From Last Time? CryptoOnchain highlighted that the Bitcoin price lost a significant support level at $90,000 when it initially fell to around the $80,000 mark a week ago. Now, the price of BTC is looking to make a sustained close above the $90,000 level after bouncing back from the Point of Control (POC) near $82,000. In crypto trading, the point of control (POC) refers to the price level with the highest volume of trading activity within a given period. It basically represents a zone where buyers and sellers are equally matched, leading to the formation of support or resistance. After bouncing from the POC around $82,000, CryptoOnchain said the flagship cryptocurrency has now settled into a “clear” consolidation zone between the $70,000 and $90,000 region. While the Bitcoin price currently sits above $90,000, the analyst noted that the market leader faces potential rejection. This conclusion was drawn from on-chain data, which shows that large amounts of Bitcoin have been flowing into Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume. According to CryptoQuant, the crypto exchange has seen over $2 billion worth of BTC in the past seven days, which could put some downward pressure on the price. Besides the potential selling pressure, there is limited buying power to absorb the extra BTC supply that might hit the open market from sales. CryptoOnchain shared that the net stablecoin inflow on Binance stands at approximately $735 million, which means limited potential demand or buying power. With this “clear supply-demand imbalance,” CryptoOnchain concluded that a rejection from the $90,000 mark and sideways movement within the $70,000 – $90,000 consolidation zone is the likely scenario for the price of BTC. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC sits just above $91,000, reflecting no significant movement in the past day.

55119988,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=870293,1764460793,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/55119988.jpeg,"160 New Yorkers get $12,000 in USDC as Coinbase's crypto‑UBI pilot begins",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/160-new-yorkers-12000-crypto-usdc-coinbase/,"160 people in New York City are now receiving $12,000 each in crypto through a five‑month cash transfer program funded with money that came from Coinbase. The funds did not come directly from the exchange this year. Coinbase donated the money to a nonprofit after shutting down its own philanthropy program two years ago, and that nonprofit is now running the pilot. The payments are going out in USDC, a stablecoin that tracks the U.S. dollar. The goal is simple on paper. Move real money to real people using crypto rails and track what happens. The program started in September and will end in February. Each of the 160 participants began receiving $800 per month in USDC at the start of the pilot. On top of those monthly payments, every participant also received a one‑time $8,000 lump sum in November.When the five months are finished, each person will have collected exactly $12,000. All transfers are delivered digitally through crypto wallets using USDC as the payment rail. New York pilot sends cash as monthly USDC and a large lump sum The cash transfer trial follows the model of guaranteed basic income programs that already exist across the United States and in other countries.These programs send money directly to people with no spending rules attached. The payments go to a selected group, not the entire population. Most guaranteed income programs target households that earn close to the poverty line. This makes them different from universal basic income, where everyone in a city or country would receive payments no matter their income level. The New York crypto pilot changed the usual payment pattern by adding a large upfront payment. Emma Kelsey, the program lead for the New York cash transfer project, told Business Insider that the choice to include a lump sum came from past research. “A lot of the research in our international work and in the US has shown that a lump sum could allow people to invest or do things that might have higher costs, like a security deposit or sign up for an education or training program,” she said. “But, also, it’s something that we’ve heard from participants is a preference.” Kelsey also pointed to a separate program in Georgia called In Her Hands, which is run by GiveDirectly.That project also tested larger upfront payments instead of only sending monthly transfers. “We did a lot of community research and heard from them that this lump sum approach could be more valuable for them versus a standard recurring payment model,” she said. The New York pilot copied that structure by pairing steady monthly USDC with one large payout. GiveDirectly selects South Bronx and East Harlem for crypto payments GiveDirectly chose to run the pilot in New York City for several reasons.According to Kelsey, one factor was support from local politicians for crypto‑based tools.Another factor was the level of need in the target neighborhoods. The 160 participants were selected from the South Bronx and East Harlem, two areas with very low household income levels. “We chose New York, in particular the South Bronx and East Harlem, because there are incredibly low‑income areas,” she said. “There has also been support from politicians in the area around crypto, making it accessible. It seems like a really natural fit where the need was high, but also the ecosystem around crypto had more support than in some other areas.” The decision to use crypto instead of regular bank transfers also sets this pilot apart from most other guaranteed income tests. Kelsey said GiveDirectly wants to see how people react when money arrives through digital wallets instead of bank accounts. “We are really interested to see if people use it differently,” she said. “Do they perceive it differently? Is it more or less useful to them?” Kelsey also said residents in the South Bronx and East Harlem may be more open to using crypto than traditional banking tools.She said some residents already face limits with standard financial services. “We thought it would be a good opportunity to see if this type of payment modality would be viewed favorably,” she said. The pilot will continue sending $800 each month through February, after the November lump sum already landed in wallets.

This happened during a week when the major U.S. stock averages still managed to finish higher, even as November as a whole dragged. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.5% for the month, snapping a seven‑month winning streak, while the S&P 500 and the 30‑stock Dow barely held onto small gains as pressure built across big technology names over high valuations and real questions around when massive AI spending will finally turn into steady profits. Using the CNBC Pro stock screener, analysts filtered for companies inside the S&P 500 that rallied this week while also posting an RSI above 70, and that screen pulled up only a handful of names. Alphabet and Ralph Lauren landed near the front of that group. The metric flags stocks that have run too hard in a short time and may be set for near‑term pullbacks even when broader markets look calm. Alphabet draws buyers as Gemini 3 fuels the latest rally The move in Alphabet came as investors rushed into the stock after growing doubts around OpenAI’s funding model and renewed questions about the strength of ChatGPT after the ChatGPT‑5 release in August failed to impress. Traders focused instead on Gemini 3 and the company’s in‑house Tensor Processing Units, both of which pushed shares sharply higher this week. The stock’s rise over the past year has also been visible on its one‑year performance chart as money continued to rotate into select AI names. Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes addressed the run in a client note on Nov. 24. Ben wrote, “Some investors are petrified that Alphabet will win the AI war due to huge improvements in its Gemini AI model and ongoing benefits from its custom TPU chip.” He added , “Gemini 3 should help the highly profitable API business and arguably vaults GOOGL ahead in agents … the benefits of Gemini 3 are being deployed immediately to help Search within AI Mode, which also helps alleviate concerns in the core business.” The quotes landed as the stock pushed deeper into technically stretched levels. Merck and retail names join the overbought list Merck also landed on the overbought screen with a 14‑day RSI of 80, the highest reading among the group. The drugmaker reported third‑quarter earnings and revenue above expectations in late October, driven by strong demand for its cancer immunotherapy Keytruda. Around the same time, Merck narrowed its full‑year profit outlook after lowering estimated tariff costs and adjusting for other items. On Nov. 14, the company announced plans to acquire Cidara Therapeutics in a nearly $9.2 billion deal to secure access to an experimental flu drug. After the rally, Merck shares climbed more than 21% in November, and analysts now see limited upside. Their consensus price target of $102.43 implies about 2% downside, based on market tracking from LSEG. Ralph Lauren and Las Vegas Sands rounded out the rest of the overbought group. Ralph Lauren’s RSI sits at 71, while Las Vegas Sands stands at 79.8. Ralph Lauren shares jumped 8% this week, lifting the stock to a November gain of roughly 15.5%. The rally followed a strong second‑quarter performance and guidance, which pushed analysts at TD Cowen and Telsey Advisory Group to raise their price targets earlier this month. All of the stocks on the list share the same warning light right now. They posted fast gains in a market already uneasy about stretched prices, slowing momentum in tech, and the long road ahead for turning AI investment into steady cash flows, according to the same market screen that flagged each of them this week.

As the momentum continues to increase and with high development progress already being registered, many traders deem that this token is one of the potential best tokens to buy now before it comes nearer to launching. There are indicators that the period of the greatest growth can be yet to come. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol that is aimed at developing utility. Included in the system is a Peer-to-Contract architecture whereby the users deposit assets and earn mtTokens. These mtTokens are increasing in value in accordance with the interest of the borrowers, which is an APY that is directly dependent on activity in the protocol. Another developing market is Peer to Peer. Depending on how they want to repay the loan, Borrower is given the option of using the variable and stable rates. Variable rates move with the use of the pool, whereas stable rates permit costs that may be predicted. LTV rules ensure safety. Stable assets are able to support higher LTVs, approximately 75% whereas volatile tokens are able to be near 35%t or 40%. In case of a collapse in the collateral, liquidations safeguard the pool by handing liquidators discounted collateral and liquidating risky positions. Holder Development and Increasing Demand Mutuum Finance started its journey at the beginning of 2025 at approximately $0.01. This has been followed by steady purchasing which has paved the way to a price of $0.035, an increment of 250%. The project has raised $19M on the board of investors and has established a number of 18,200 owners. All the stages have been driven by high demand. Phase 6 is currently deep into its allocation, so there is little of the tokens at the current price. Increase in presale activity is a typical indication of good market sentiment as indicated by analysts. The initial launch price of MUTM will be at $0.06, which could place early investors at an advantage to over 500% token appreciation. Mutuum Finance also has close community presence through its 24-hour leaderboard in which the best player wins $500 in MUTM. This will assist in attracting daily inflow and hastens total demand. It is the low price, combined with solid investments and increasing activity that lead many traders to believe that MUTM is one of the potential best cryptocurrencies with the price below $0.05. V1 Launch and Major Audits Based on the official X account of the project, V1 of Mutuum Finance is planned to be released on the Sepolia Testnet in the fourth quarter of 2025. This edition comprises the liquidity pool, the mtToken system, the debt-tracking token and the liquidation bot with ETH and USDT support available as soon as it is usable. It gives Mutuum Finance a great edge over many new DeFi tokens because it has a working product before it launches. One of the strongest areas of the project is security. The CertiK audit of the code was with a 90/100 Token Scan and the final version of the lending and borrowing contracts are in the review with Halborn Security . Such stacks of checks give MUTM some degree of trust that a token at an early stage may not have. Due to these reasons, analysts are confident that MUTM will be increasing amidst a great margin once it attains its launch price of $0.06. Other estimates suggest early goals of between $0.25 and $0.40 based on market volume, platform usage and general DeFi usage. According to many investors, Mutuum Finance is one of the most robust DeFi competitors with a valuation under $0.04, developing lending solutions, robust audits, yield system, layer 2 growth and stablecoin plans. The allocation of Phase 6 is almost complete and the supply is depleting rapidly, which means that the sense of urgency is gaining momentum. To the investors who are seeking the most feasible cryptocurrency to purchase, the chances of purchasing MUTM at $0.035 would not last long.

With a deeper corrective target on the macro frame and a respected support zone in the mid-range, SOL is gearing up for a move that could shape its next major trend. This Wave Completed As Solana Signals A Larger Pullback Elliott Waves Academy has presented a fresh perspective on SOL, focusing on the weekly timeframe. According to the analysis, SOL appears to have completed its upward wave, identified as wave (1)/(A), within a broader bullish structure. This recent break below a key level reinforces the view that a deeper corrective phase may already be underway. Related Reading: Solana Reclaims Crucial Resistance Despite First SOL ETF Outflows – 25% Rally Ahead? Based on the wave count and Fibonacci measurements, the correction is expected to extend toward the $49.26–$32.03 range, which aligns with the 50%–61.8% retracement levels. Should SOL reach this area, a clear corrective pattern paired with a strong bounce would help validate the broader bullish thesis and suggest that buyers are stepping back in with conviction. Price behavior within this zone will be critical in determining the next major swing. If this scenario unfolds as anticipated, a decisive breakout above the key level that was previously broken will act as confirmation for renewed upside momentum. However, a violation of the $8.00 level would invalidate the bullish outlook entirely, signaling a much deeper structural shift. SOL Coils For Impact As Price Compresses Into A Tightening Structure According to a recent update from CryptoPulse, Solana is shaping up for what looks like a textbook technical setup. The current structure is tightening, showing reduced volatility and signaling that a decisive move may be approaching. With SOL consolidating, the chart is beginning to align with a major technical level. Related Reading: Solana Pullback Finds Purpose As Strong Hands Eye Accumulation Below $160 The key zone highlighted is the $133 support level, an area that has previously acted as a reliable reaction point for buyers. Real partnerships, continuous development, and increasing on-chain activity are all reinforcing this technical zone with additional weight. Given this confluence, the strategy becomes clearer: allow price to revisit the $133 region and observe how the market responds. If buyers step in aggressively, forming wicks, bullish engulfing candles, or strong volume spikes, it could signal that the level is holding once again. CryptoPulse emphasizes patience above all. Instead of chasing the market, let the chart come to you. When both fundamentals and technicals point to the same area, it often increases the probability of a strong follow-through. Acting on confirmation rather than prediction is the key to building a solid position in setups like this.

Within this period, the premier cryptocurrency saw a decline to as low as $80,600, marking a more than 10% deviation from the aforementioned support. As the price stands fairly over $90,000, there seems to be a recovery underway. However, a closer monitoring of on-chain activity has revealed that the reality is diametrically opposite to widespread expectation. LTH-STH SOPR Ratio Spikes To 2.63 — What This Means In a recent QuickTake post on CryptoQuant, the on-chain analytics platform Arab Chain reveals a shift within the internal structures of the Bitcoin market. This report revolves around readings obtained from the Binance: BTC SOPR Ratio (LTH – STH) metric, which assesses and compares the profit-taking behavior of Bitcoin’s long-term holders (LTH) to that of its short-term holders (STH). Arab Chain highlights that the LTH-STH ratio recently saw a spike to 2.63, a reading which marks the highest level put in since August. Notably, this spike in the SOPR index comes amid Bitcoin’s rise to around $90,000, signaling an underlying spike in LTH sell-off despite this modest rebound. This notion is confirmed by the Long-Term Holder SOPR itself, which reportedly to 2.58, indicating that members of Bitcoin’s most influential trend setters are currently exiting the market in deep profits. Normally, the sharp move in the LTH–STH ratio, especially one that causes the establishment of a multi-month high, usually represents a period of selling pressure that typically precedes price corrections. However, the current situation steers slightly away from this standard. ‘Profit-Taking Phase May Go On For Several Weeks’ — Analyst As the LTH SOPR reads 2.58, the STH SOPR stands at levels around the 0.98 mark, suggesting that the flagship cryptocurrency’s short-term holders are selling off their holdings either at break-even or even with some losses incurred. The market imbalance, therefore, reveals itself in that “long-term investors are capturing substantial profits and capitalizing on previous rallies to sell off, while short-term investors are unable to achieve clear gains.” Arab Chain explains that if the Bitcoin price decline should intensify, there could be additional acceleration dedicated to its fall down south. Historically, widening gaps between LTH and STH SOPR have often preceded defined movements in BTC’s market cycle. This behavior, according to Arab Chain, reveals that the market is likely entering a typical “cash-for-profit” phase, where its major holders sell off their holdings. Seeing as a surge of an almost comparable magnitude last took place in August, the firm conjectures that the market could see a major price reset, as opposed to the minor price fluctuation investors may be anticipating. As of this writing, Bitcoin is worth about $90,652, recording no significant movement over the past day.",Bitcoin|Arab Chain|bitcoin|Bitcoin LTH SOPR|Bitcoin STH SOPR|Long-Term Holders|LTH-STH Ratio,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-30 01:00:45

By 2028, $TRUMP could reach a maximum price of $28.45. In 2031, $TRUMP will range between $34.14 to $46.22. The Official Trump coin ($TRUMP) was launched on January 17, 2025, just three days before the inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump. Following President Trump’s “newfound” crypto inclination, the $TRUMP meme coin was birthed. My NEW Official Trump Meme is HERE! It’s time to celebrate everything we stand for: WINNING!

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 18, 2025 The coin has a total supply of 1 Billion tokens, with an initial 200 million tokens unlocked at launch. Subsequent unlocks are scheduled over the next three (3) years. $Trump token unlock roadmap Trump’s “advocacy” for digital assets reforms boosted interest in $TRUMP in the first few days, driving it to an all-time high (ATH) of $75.35. Several other meme tokens, like the Official MELANIA coin, also rode the momentum. Despite the initial surge, Official Trump’s value has plunged to lower levels amidst shifting market sentiment and uproar around the legitimacy of a “President-owned Meme coin.” The price performance of Official Trump is down over 85% from its all-time high, raising questions among investors, such as: How much will Trump coin be worth? Can Trump coin reach $100? This piece explores the Official Trump price predictions for 2025-2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Official Trump Token $TRUMP Price $6.05 Market Capitalization $1.208B Trading Volume $172.68M Circulating Supply 199.99M TRUMP All-time High $75.35 (January 19, 2025) All-time Low $1.21 (January 18, 2025) 24-h High $6.11 24-h Low $6.01 Official Trump technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 9.49% (High) 14-Day RSI 37.97 (Neutral) 50-Day SMA $6.88 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 28(Fear) Green Days 9/30 (30%) 200-Day SMA $9.31 Official Trump Coin ($TRUMP) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown Bearish momentum is fading for $TRUMP, but no solid reversal signals have formed yet. Official TRUMP coin’s price is stabilizing above $6, suggesting sellers are losing strength. Official Trump coin 1-day price analysis The daily chart for November 30 shows TRUMP trading at $6.05, sitting just above the lower Bollinger band at $5.60, where the price has been sliding but is now flattening. This compression signals selling pressure losing strength, though buyers have not yet reclaimed the mid-band at $6.68, which remains a strong resistance to watch. TRUMP/USDT 1-day price chart by TradingView Momentum remains weak, with the MACD sitting deep in bearish territory and still diverging lower, although the histogram is starting to lighten, an early hint that downside momentum is slowing rather than accelerating. The RSI at 38 shows oversold-leaning conditions but without any bullish divergence yet, meaning it’s too early to declare a trend reversal, though price stability above $5.60 would improve the odds. Official Trump 4-hour price analysis The 4-hour chart shows TRUMP hovering at $6.04, repeatedly testing but holding the $6.00 psychological level. The Alligator indicator remains fully open in a downward feed, confirming the downtrend is still active. However, the lines are beginning to converge slightly, indicating the bearish wave may be tiring. TRUMP/USDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The RSI on the 4-hour sits at 36, similar to the daily reading, suggesting sellers are losing strength, but buyers have not yet stepped in with conviction. OBV remains depressed, meaning volume inflows are still weak and any bounce will likely be gradual rather than explosive. $TRUMP technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $6.96 SELL SMA 5 $6.67 SELL SMA 10 $6.62 SELL SMA 21 $7.10 SELL SMA 50 $6.88 SELL SMA 100 $7.61 SELL SMA 200 $9.31 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $6.85 SELL EMA 5 $7.03 SELL EMA 10 $7.39 SELL EMA 21 $7.90 SELL EMA 50 $8.58 SELL EMA 100 $9.39 SELL EMA 200 $10.60 SELL What to expect from $TRUMP price analysis TRUMP is more likely to range and attempt a slow rebound from the $5.60–$6.00 zone, but until it breaks $6.15 with strength, the broader downtrend remains intact. The next 24–72 hours should focus on whether buyers defend $5.60, which will dictate whether consolidation continues or the trend weakens further. Is Official Trump a good investment? Meme coins like $TRUMP are volatile and driven by hype, not fundamentals. While they can offer big rewards, they come with high risk and uncertainty. If you’re making an investment decision on TRUMP coin, do your own research carefully and prepare for price swings. Why is $TRUMP down? $TRUMP plunged hard post‑launch, now rattling in a tight $5–8 consolidation over the past month as traders wait for new hype or a breakdown. With most tokens controlled by insiders, sentiment remains weak, and only fresh utility or momentum could revitalize it. Official Trump coin price history by Coingecko Will Official Trump reach $50 soon? $TRUMP coin already saw this price point in January; increased investor interest could result in a quick resurgence. Will Official Trump reach $100? Having touched a peak price of $75.35 and a market cap of $15 billion in its first few weeks, the $100 milestone might not be much of a hurdle to scale, provided $TRUMP can recapture the momentum it had in its earlier days. Will $TRUMP reach $1000? For $TRUMP to hit $1,000, its market cap would need to rise over 100× into the hundreds of billions, or even trillions if locked supply is released. With dilution risks, weak fundamentals, regulation, and competition, the chance of this happening in the next few years is very low.” Does Official Trump have a good long-term future? The long-term future of the Official Trump Coin is uncertain. While it has gained attention, peaked at $75, and generated significant revenue, its success will depend on crypto market trends, investor confidence, and how it navigates regulatory challenges. Recent news/opinion on $TRUMP Melania ‘meme coin’ value bottoms out as Trump brands collapse: WSJ Wall Street Journal reports that the market has “soured” on Trump brands. Reporter Jack Pitcher wrote, “Digital ‘meme coins’ named for Trump and first lady Melania Trump are down 86% and 99% since inauguration day, respectively.

Official TRUMP historic price sentiment Official Trump coin price history by Coingecko Official Trump coin was launched on January 17, 2025, just a few days before the US presidential inauguration. Briefly after launch, the euphoria of DJT’s inauguration drove the $TRUMP coin to an all-time high of $75.35. As expected, market players took profit, and the Official Trump coin lost momentum, hitting a low of $18.75 by February 1, a massive 75% drop in price. Further price declines followed, but $TRUMP showed some resilience, reaching a high of $24 by mid-February, albeit short-lived. The bears recaptured the market in the following months, and the Official Trump coin settled at lower prices – about $7 to $11 between March and April. $TRUMP hit a high of $16.28 by April end, but has since maintained an average price of about $10.5. Official Trump coin traded between $8.07 and $10.13 in August. In September, TRUMP maintained a trading range of $7.37-$9.46, and in October, it traded between $7.65-$8.02.

According to reports , the incident forced the plant to shut down its generation and data center operations, temporarily stopping both company-run rigs and machines operating for clients. Electrical Switchgear Failure Reported Based on reports, an electrical switchgear malfunction on November 23, 2025 started the fire and triggered automatic safety systems that de-energized the facility. The Dresden plant, which has about 106 megawatts of generation capacity, was taken offline immediately to prevent further damage. Company filings and local updates said none of the hosted mining machines — including those co-located for NYDIG — suffered material damage during the event. A fire just halted operations at Greenidge Generation’s #Bitcoin mining site — a major facility co-hosting rigs for NYDIG. No hardware lost, but the incident reveals a hidden risk: physical infrastructure fragility in the mining stack. #BTC #MiningOps #CryptoInfra #NYBitcoin pic.twitter.com/35sMu2x3le — ₿itBlitz (@BitBlitz) November 28, 2025 Emergency crews responded and the fire was contained, but the outage left the site idle while technicians inspected equipment and repaired infrastructure. Impact On Mining Operations And Clients Reports have disclosed that the shutdown means lost hashing time for every miner at the site. For co-hosting customers like NYDIG, downtime translates to missed block rewards until the machines can be safely powered up again. Mining firms typically earn revenue only while rigs run, so even a short stoppage can cut into weekly receipts. Industry observers noted that the Dresden plant is a major part of Greenidge’s US footprint, so the pause affects a sizable share of the company’s output. Bitcoin Mining Economics Under Pressure Mining profitability is under strain across the board as network difficulty climbs and competition increases. Based on recent market data, margins are tighter than in prior cycles, making every hour of offline time more costly. Investigation And Recovery Timetable According to the company, crews are working to restore service and Greenidge expects a return to normal operations within a few weeks. That timetable is provisional and tied to the results of inspections and replacement of damaged switchgear. Regulators and insurers will likely review the incident, and an internal investigation is expected to clarify the cause of the failure and whether any maintenance gaps contributed. Stakeholders will watch closely for confirmed repair schedules and any disclosures about lost bitcoin production or costs tied to the outage. Co-hosts will also monitor whether the incident prompts changes to safety practices or contract terms for hosted rigs.

Following this move, the Central Asian nation joins the expanding list of countries opting for regulation in the crypto industry against an outright ban. Turkmenistan Explores Crypto Amid Economy Diversification On Friday, Reuters reported that President Serdar Berdymukhamedov of Turkmenistan signed a new law that will permit registration of crypto exchanges and crypto mining companies from January 1, 2026. Notably, this development appears to represent part of the state government’s recent efforts to diversify its economy beyond gas exports, following Turkmenistan’s status as the nation with fourth fourth-largest gas reserves. Reuters also confirmed the government’s motive behind its new regulation, stating an intent to drive investment and speed up digitalization. While there are no official data on the level of crypto ownership in Turkmenistan, citizens’ ability to purchase digital assets using credit/debit cards, as well as the existence of Bitcoin ATMs, indicate significant traction requiring legalization. In particular, local Kyrgyzstan media states the new regulations signed by President Berdymukhamedov assert the legal status of cryptocurrencies as civil assets but with no economic power to serve as currency or means of payment. Furthermore, all licensed crypto exchanges are mandated to ensure the protection of users’ data and deposits. Meanwhile, mining operations can be performed by both individuals and local businesses following approval and registration with the recognized state authority. Other aspects of Turkmenistan’s crypto regime cover specific definitions of terms, and operations center around offering, transfer, issuance, and storage. Crypto Adoption Surges In Central Asia Beyond Turkmenistan, other nations in Central Asia, including Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, are also ramping up crypto regulatory efforts to create an enabling environment for digital assets adoption. Notably, Uzbekistan has completed legal preparations to formally adopt stablecoins for payments in 2026, while also permitting the trading of tokenized stocks on licensed exchanges. Meanwhile, Bitcoinist reported that Kazakhstan has recently allocated $500 million – $1 billion for a national reserve fund with a potential launch slated for 2026. In addition, the former soviet state also introduced a national stablecoin, KZTx, in collaboration with the world’s biggest exchange, Binance. Taken together, these crypto-friendly moves show that Central Asian nations are doubling down on blockchain and digital assets as an emerging pillar of the global financial sector. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the total crypto market cap is now valued at $3.05 trillion following a modest rebound in the last week after an extended correction that began in early October.",Crypto News|crypto exchanges|crypto mining|Crypto Regulations|Kazakhstan|Reuters|Turkmenistan|Uzbekistan,EN,0,0,ASIA|EXCHANGE|MINING|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-30 05:00:40

Here’s the Latest,https://timestabloid.com/institutions-using-coinbase-to-stack-xrp-into-cold-storage-heres-the-latest/,"Xaif (@Xaif_Crypto) posted a striking message on X showing a transaction of 11.64 million XRP sent to Coinbase. The image he shared detailed a successful transfer from a private account to Coinbase’s wallet. His post appeared as activity around XRP increased following the launch of new spot ETFs . Xaif tied the activity to previous comments made by industry analyst Chad Steingraber. He argued that movements of this size into Coinbase should not be treated as random. With Coinbase acting as the main custodian for asset managers, he sees the transfer as institutions placing XRP into cold storage for ETFs. As @ChadSteingraber said when you see 11.64M $XRP getting moved into Coinbase, it’s no coincidence. With Coinbase as the primary custodian for asset managers, this is institutions stacking XRP straight into cold storage. https://t.co/O7qOgQzFP4 pic.twitter.com/RtIW3YOhxN — Xaif Crypto| (@Xaif_Crypto) November 28, 2025 ETF Growth Changes XRP Custody ETFs have gained significant attention over the past few weeks. These products allow asset managers to gain exposure through regulated markets rather than direct exchange trading. Since their launch, these products have seen major inflows , with investors rapidly joining the XRP market. The launch of XRP ETFs changed how XRP moves through the market. Funds must hold the asset with a regulated custodian. Coinbase fills that role for most major asset managers in the U.S. That setup explains why large amounts of XRP are now flowing into Coinbase wallets. These transfers do not signal selling pressure. They point to custody. Tokens sent in for ETF backing move into cold storage. Chad Steingraber had earlier explained this pattern. He said large Coinbase inflows often reflect institutional positioning rather than normal exchange use. Xaif’s post echoed that view and added clear transaction data as support. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Impact of Cold Storage Once XRP enters cold storage , it leaves the active trading pool. These tokens are not placed on order books. They are held for long periods to back ETF shares. This process has already reduced the amount of XRP available on exchanges. Public data shows exchange balances are declining . That trend has slowed supply while ETF demand grows. The 11.64 million XRP transfer Xaif shared fits neatly into this picture. It reflects how ETFs change both custody and circulation. Each new fund purchase removes more XRP from liquid markets. The transfer Xaif highlighted does not stand alone. Large token movements have appeared in recent weeks. Together, they show a system forming behind the ETFs. Asset managers do not trade in and out daily. They accumulate and hold. As these products expand, more XRP will shift into long-term storage. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Although it was stopped there, it now stands close to $0.26, which actually means that its monthly performance is quite promising compared to the rest of the market, as almost all of its digital asset competitors have posted double-digit losses. But the question now arises of what’s next, and we decided to get in touch with ChatGPT and Perplexity to check their views on the matter for PI in December. Is ChatGPT Bullish? Despite the recent positive PI performance, in which the asset gained over 50% since its all-time low on October 10, its overall trend since it saw the light of day in February this year has been quite painful, and ChatGPT reminded that investors should also pay attention to that 90% drop. Nevertheless, it believes that the recent stabilization above $0.23 is the first good sign as it suggests that “sellers may finally be losing control.” It noted that the $0.21-$0.23 support is crucial for PI and could determine its overall performance in December. In terms of actual price predictions, ChatGPT said the token could reach up to $0.35 over the next several weeks. To do so, it would need alignment across several factors, such as better overall market conditions and continued updates to the Pi Network ecosystem, including the latest improvements in the Pi App Studio. In contrast, if the market heads for another correction and PI fails to break the $0.27 resistance, then it could fulfill the bear-case scenario, which envisions another drop below $0.20 and possibly challenging the ATL of just over $0.172. It actually noted that this is the least likely scenario as PI will now enter December “in a stronger position than it’s been in months,” before it added: “The token shows stability, improving structure, and relative strength compared to the broader market. If the ecosystem continues to expand — and if macro conditions don’t deteriorate — PI could deliver one of its better months.” Does Perplexity Agree? ChatGPT’s competitor wasn’t as hopeful for PI. It began its prediction by noting that analysts are “bearish short-term” for December, with “models forecasting averages of $0.198 and ranges of $0.194-$0.202, implying potential 20-25% drops from current levels.” It said that some technical indicators, such as the RSI going above 65, suggest PI might be overbought and due for a correction. It also noted that the overall crypto market is not out of the woods yet, which could trigger another industry-wide correction that can impact Pi Network’s native token as well. In conclusion, Perplexity warned investors to be wary about PI’s performance in the next month. Although there’s a chance for “flat-to-modest gains,” it added that “bearish forecasts suggest a cautious year-end around $0.20.” The post How High Can Pi Network’s (PI) Price Go in December? 2 AIs Speculate With Big Numbers appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|Pi Network (PI),EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-11-30 05:15:55

This session did not follow that pattern. Within 2 hours and 30 minutes of the U.S. market opening, XRP-based ETFs posted notable trading activity. Crypto commentator Xaif (@Xaif_Crypto) shared the figures in a post on X, highlighting the massive trading volume.

Canary Capital led the group with $4.67 million. Franklin Templeton followed closely at $4.24 million. Bitwise ranked third at $4.09 million. Grayscale recorded $1.64 million, while Rex Osprey posted $1.40 million. Canary Capital has been a notable force in the ETF market since its launch. It hit a record volume of $58 million on its launch day. However, Franklin Templeton and Bitwise are also making notable waves in the market. The tight spread at the top shows that all three funds are trading within a narrow band. That pattern showed no single issuer had locked up liquidity. Xaif summed up the action with a short remark. “Institutional money is rotating fast,” he wrote. He added that “the XRP ETF race is only getting louder.” What to Expect from ETFs Xaif’s data focused strictly on what had already traded. Another market participant added a forward-looking note. Chad Steingraber, who had previously analyzed the market’s performance, predicted that the funds could reach $50 million before the halfway point of the trading session. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 At the start of the week, these funds closed with a total volume of over $85 million . That value excluded the Rex Osprey ETF, and the current pace suggests it could surpass that volume before the end of the current session. Expansion Still Ahead These five ETFs represent only the first wave. Several issuers continue to prepare additional XRP-related products. Some filings target different fee structures. Others aim at alternative custody or liquidity arrangements. Some experts have suggested that up to 12 XRP ETFs are ready to launch . As more products reach the market, volume will likely spread further before consolidating again. The early session numbers show one thing clearly. XRP ETFs have entered an active phase.

Zhao touched upon the importance of investor psychology in his post on his social media account. “It may be an unpopular opinion, but the best strategy is to sell during periods of maximum greed and buy during periods of maximum fear,” Zhao said, reminding that opportunities arise, especially during periods when the market enters panic mode. After Bitcoin retreated to $81,000, market sentiment deteriorated sharply. With Bitcoin trading at $90,710, the Cryptocurrency Fear & Greed Index clearly reflects the deterioration in investor sentiment. As of today, the index sits at 20, falling into the “fear” category. Related News: Strategy CEO Responds: Will the Company Sell Bitcoin? What Will Happen to the BTC Price in the Future? While this level is the same as yesterday's, it represents a significant improvement compared to last week. The index had fallen to the “extreme fear” zone last week, falling as low as 10. The index, which was again in the “fear” zone at 39 a month ago, reveals that investor sentiment has been stuck in negative territory for a long time. The picture is even more striking when comparing year-to-year: the index peaked at 84 in November 2024, at the “extreme greed” level, and then fell to the 10 level in November 2025, reaching its annual low, demonstrating the drastic shift in market sentiment. CZ's message reiterates the importance of these emotional swings to investment strategies, and current market conditions support his words. Despite Bitcoin's gain of over 7% in the past week, the overall market remains subdued, prompting investors to exercise caution. *This is not investment advice.

However, a monumental shift is now underway as Apple Pay has integrated into leading crypto platforms, and getting a major upgrade is becoming as seamless and intuitive as any other digital transaction. This integration removes one of the biggest barriers to entry by replacing traditional transactions. Why Apple’s Entry Signals A Turning Point For Global Crypto Payments Apple Pay is now directly integrated with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. A crypto site, CryptosRus, has revealed on X that Apple users can now purchase BTC and other cryptocurrencies directly within Trust Wallet using Apple Pay . This integration will make buying crypto as easy as buying Apps from the App Store, dramatically lowering friction for newcomers with no more clunky bank transfers , complex onboarding forms, and steep learning curves. With a few simple taps via Apple Pay, the crypto will be in your Trust Wallet. In short, Apple is helping to replace fear and friction with just tap-and-own simplicity. This Apple Pay and crypto is the kind that will seamlessly onramp. Bitcoin and crypto adoption are sharply gaining traction globally. In a surprising turn for one of the world’s most tightly controlled economies, Turkmenistan has officially legalized Bitcoin and broader cryptocurrency trading. CryptosRus stated that President Serdar Berdimuhamedov has signed a new Sweeping bill that sets the stage for a fully regulated crypto market to begin in 2026. The new law establishes a dedicated state Commission that will oversee licensing, Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) protocols, cold-storage rules, mining registration, and even the power to halt or require refunds for token issuances. According to CryptoRus, this is a sign that even the most controlled states are being pushed into crypto adoption as the global regulation accelerates. Bitcoin Decentralized Rails More Resilient Than TradFi Hardware? An author and ideologist, Shanaka Anslem Perera, pointed out that the day $13.4 billion in Bitcoin options expired, the traditional financial system nearly collapsed. At the crucial hour of 03:00 GMT, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) froze, a cooling failure originating from a single data center. The failure led to 90% of global derivatives trading being halted. Meanwhile, a larger sum of $15 billion in crypto options was settled on time, with each block confirmed and every trade seamlessly executed. The machines that price the world stopped working because they were overheated, and the decentralized alternative rails ran exactly as designed. “This isn’t a coincidence, it’s a stress test , and only one system passed the test,” Shanaka noted.",Bitcoin|AML|Anti-Money Laundering|apple|Apple Pay|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Chicago Mercantile Exchange|CME|CryptoRus|know-your-customer|KYC|Shanaka Anslem Perera,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-30 06:30:06

Analysts monitoring the early trading activity suggest that sustained ETF accumulation could meaningfully reduce the quantity of XRP available to retail markets, potentially influencing the token’s valuation. This development has raised questions about how such a scenario might affect investors holding moderate amounts of the digital asset, particularly those with 1,000 to 5,000 XRP. Rising ETF Demand and Early Accumulation Trends Since their debut, XRP ETFs have attracted substantial inflows. Within the first eleven trading days, the four available products collectively gained approximately $666 million in net purchases. This figure has already surpassed the inflows recorded by the six Solana ETFs, which reached $618 million after twenty-three days. The pace of accumulation has prompted speculation that ETF issuers could, at some point, absorb a significant share of XRP held on centralized exchanges. This possibility has been highlighted by commentators who argue that persistent inflows could tighten supply conditions over time. Estimating How Long Exchange Reserves Could Last Digital Perspectives founder Brad Kimes recently reviewed exchange liquidity estimates using Grok, which assessed XRP tokens that are accessible for active trading. According to the model’s response, major platforms such as Binance, Upbit, Bithumb, and OKX collectively hold between 5 and 6 billion XRP in liquid reserves as of late November 2025. The report also indicated that Binance controls the largest share, approximately 2.71 billion XRP. This figure has declined by roughly 400 million tokens between early October and mid-November, reflecting ongoing withdrawals and ETF-driven demand. Grok further observed that exchanges lost about 73 million XRP in a single day during recent market activity, suggesting continued outflows and reduced selling pressure. Overall, the estimated 5 to 6 billion XRP in liquid supply represents around 9% to 11% of the circulating 56 billion tokens. To evaluate how quickly ETFs could remove this supply, the model reviewed inflows from Nov. 25 to 27. During this period, issuers received an average of $26 million per day. At an XRP price of $2.20, this equates to roughly 11.8 million XRP purchased daily. Based on this rate, Grok estimated that clearing 5 billion XRP would take about 422 days, while removing 6 billion XRP would require approximately 506 days, placing the timeline between 14 and 17 months. Projected Price Ranges Under a Supply Reduction Scenario To understand the potential price impact , Google Gemini was consulted. The model emphasized that price responses to supply constraints tend to accelerate as available liquidity decreases. Gemini referenced a Bank of America analysis from 2021 showing that each $1 entering Bitcoin during constrained periods contributed significantly more to total market value. Using comparable assumptions, Gemini proposed several potential XRP price ranges if ETF accumulation removes most of the remaining liquid supply. The initial range falls between $8 and $13, assuming steady momentum. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A deeper supply reduction could support valuations between $20 and $25, particularly if the broader market revalues major assets and Ethereum approaches a higher market capitalization. Gemini also outlined a more extreme case, where limited liquidity forces ETF issuers to purchase at progressively higher prices, which could push XRP above $50. Gemini suggested that such an increase could unfold across three stages within seventeen months: An initial accumulation period lifting XRP from $2.20 to around $5, a middle phase driving the price toward $15, and a final period characterized by accelerated increases into the $20 to $50+ region. Current data indicates that 596,029 wallets contain between 1,000 and 5,000 XRP, making this one of the largest holder groups. Presently , 1,000 XRP is worth $2,210, and 5,000 XRP is worth around $11,050. If XRP reaches $50, 1,000 XRP would rise to $50,000, while 5,000 XRP would expand to $250,000. Even at a $20 price level, 1,000 XRP would be worth $20,000, and 5,000 XRP would be valued at $100,000. These estimates illustrate the scale of gains for holders if ETF accumulation significantly reduces supply. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

(95% will be EXIT LIQUIDITY) RT for updates!… pic.twitter.com/vVgarmipVz — JD (@jaydee_757) November 28, 2025 A Crucial Message to Traders JD kept his message direct. He said he expects one last move before a sharp correction. He also warned that most traders will not react fast enough and said, “95% will be EXIT LIQUIDITY .” His statement shows his belief that market participants often refuse to sell early and then face the downside. The chart he shared supports that view. It shows XRP on the monthly timeframe with an ascending triangle that formed over several years. The price moved inside a clear rising trendline and tested a horizontal resistance multiple times. The Technical Picture In late 2024, XRP experienced a sharp rise that sent it above the ascending triangle. This breakout gave way to another crucial technical pattern. JD displayed RSI data at the bottom of the chart. The RSI formed a lower low while the price formed a higher low. He marked this as hidden bullish divergence . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This condition appears when momentum weakens during a pullback, but the price holds its trend. Traders view that as a sign of continuation rather than trend exhaustion. JD pointed to this to support his expectation for one more upward move. Where XRP Could Be Heading Based on the chart, the structure remains intact as long as XRP stays above the rising trendline. The hidden bullish divergence gives the setup more strength. If buyers defend this level, XRP can reach the projected breakout zone before momentum fades. That aligns with JD’s expectation of a final push. JD has previously predicted a 95% crash after XRP’s next bullish move. In his post, the analyst describes the coming move as a rug pull crash. Traders now need to watch the asset’s movement around the rising trendline. This, combined with the RSI behavior, will determine whether XRP completes the move JD anticipates and starts the decline he has predicted.

On the question of what type of investors might be behind this increase, on-chain data suggests that it’s all about whales now. Whales Buying, Retail Sidelines? Data shared by Crypto Rover, which compares the whale vs retail data, indicates that the larger cohort of investors has been a lot more active lately. In fact, their behavior has been linked to the overall price movements of the underlying asset in the past several weeks, including a selling spree in early October when BTC peaked above $126,000 and dumped by $15,000 in days. Now, though, the data points to significant accumulation efforts once bitcoin slumped by $25,000 in just over a week to under $81,000.

ETF Investors Are Back What could be even more bullish on BTC’s upcoming price actions is the recent return of investors buying through the spot Bitcoin ETFs . The financial vehicles were in a ton of trouble for the past month, with a substantial exodus from all funds, especially BlackRock’s IBIT. The past week was the first in the green since early October, albeit in a rather modest manner. After the $151 million in net withdrawals on Monday, investors poured in $128.7 million on Tuesday, $21.1 million on Wednesday, and $71.4 million on Friday (Thursday was an official Holiday in the US). Consequently, the week ended with a minor net inflow of $70.2 million, which is still a lot better than the $1.2 billion taken out during the previous trading week.

Today, experts recognize that the same pattern appears to be emerging in Mutuum Finance, an innovative cryptocurrency that has hit the markets with much better fundamentals than ADA offered in the first year when it initially broke out, and with an actual use case in the DeFi space, including lending and interest-bearing tokens, and an impending release of testnet v1, among other things. Mutuum Finance , at $0.035, and gaining pace in its presale, and boasting now over 18,250 early adopters, finds itself on the path leading to the same success factor in the crypto markets that ADA enjoyed in 2020–2021. For investors seeking the best crypto to buy, MUTM offers a tangible utility and growth potential beyond legacy altcoins. Cardano Attempts a Short-Term Rebound as Buyers Hold Key Support Cardano (ADA) is still stabilizing above the latest low, making way for a short-term bounce. There could still be room in the ongoing bounce to reach the $0.45–$0.48 equal legs area, where past bounce attempts have indicated the likelihood of sellers re-emerging. As much as the ongoing relief rally on ADA denotes improvement in the short term, the ADA price still has much work to do in order to change the medium-term outlook. While ADA traders are watching the pivotal price levels, some investors are assessing the Mutuum Finance, which is now recognized as the top crypto in emerging DeFi markets. Mutuum Finance Presale Attracts Huge Interest Mutuum Finance, has quickly become the best crypto to buy in 2025. The presale has managed to gather over 18,250 distinct individuals, garnering over $19.02 million. The current price for Phase 6 tokens is $0.035. As the presale phases advance into Phase 7, the price of the tokens will rise by an added 20% to $0.04. The uniqueness in Mutuum Finance compared to other altcoins lies in their high-level adoption, making it a top crypto for early-stage DeFi investors. Growth Catalyst 1: Dual Lending Framework Mutuum Finance, will accelerate the adoption of the platform through their dual approach in lending. The Peer-to-Contract platform pools large assets like USDT and SOL through properly verified and secured smart contracts. The interest rate varies according to the use rate. Using an example, when the user lends $15,000, they receive the mtUSDT token, and an approximate 15% annual interest rate, resulting in $2,250 annually. The borrowers can pledge their assets, like $2,000 in ADA asset, in exchange for $1,500 in USDT liquidity. The Stability Factor and liquidation conditions in the protocol guarantee the solvency and optimal use of funds. Conversely, high volatility assets like Dogecoin are covered using the Peer-to-Peer lending module. In this scenario, the traders negotiate the terms themselves and are conscious that they are dealing with high risks in the hopes of acquiring higher returns. In the short term, traders will be able to provide, borrow, and stake their funds in specially designated pools in order to generate fixed returns. This environment makes MUTM the best crypto to invest in, specifically designed for traders who actively use the DeFi ecosystem. Growth Catalyst 2: Fee-to-Buyback Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will use platform fees on lending, borrowing, and staking as incentives to trigger a systematic process of buying back their tokens, MUTM. The purchased MUTM tokens will then be given out to those who stake their tokens in the network, effectively engendering increased activity. By correlating real on-chain activity with tangible rewards, the system encourages people to stay involved in the long run rather than speculating on the future value. This makes MUTM a top crypto for those seeking sustained utility and growth. Protocol Launch Strategy & Exchange Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) aims to debut in the Sepolia Testnet by the end of 2025, and the supported assets in the beginning are ETH and USDT, specifically used in lending, borrowing, and providing collateral. The initial version will help in enabling basic functionalities like the liquid pools, mtToken, and debt token, and liquidator bot. The testnet functionality provides an earlier opportunity to interact with the platform, and this shall enable users who join the testing process to become well-versed with the platform before the launch of the mainnet. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has rapidly increased in popularity among crypto projects in 2025, with the ongoing Phase 6 presale now over 95% sold, having raised over $19.02 million from over 18,250 members. Mutuum Finance has a dual lending model, fee-to-buyback engine, and plans to launch the Sepolia testnet. Get involved today and claim your spot in the Mutuum Finance Presale, where you can invest in the best crypto to buy and secure one of the most promising top crypto projects before the next market rally.

As one of the Asia-Pacific region’s most historic golf tournaments, the Championship provides a high-impact platform for KuCoin to engage partners, clients, and the broader community while elevating its brand presence alongside Australian golf icon and KuCoin Global Brand Ambassador Adam Scott. As part of the collaboration, KuCoin hosted an invite-only VIP hospitality experience on November 28 in a private suite overlooking the 17th hole. Designed as a strategic engagement platform rather than a traditional client event, the gathering brought together industry leaders, institutional partners, and regulatory-aligned stakeholders to deepen dialogue on building a trusted and compliant digital asset ecosystem in Australia. Set against the backdrop of KuCoin’s AUSTRAC registration and ongoing commitment to strengthening local oversight, the experience featured a premium environment with curated food, beverages, and interactive brand showcases that highlighted KuCoin’s security, transparency, and governance frameworks. The event served as an important touchpoint for advancing responsible industry collaboration and reinforcing KuCoin’s long-term commitment to compliant growth and user protection in the Australian market. Tika LUM, Head of Global Institutional Business Development at KuCoin, delivered opening remarks, covering the strategic upgrade of KuCoin Institutional and showcasing its core competencies anchored in trusted compliance, secure infrastructure, and continuous innovation—all aimed at empowering clients with advanced services, deep market intelligence, and exclusive VIP experiences. The highlight of the afternoon was an exclusive meet-and-greet with Adam Scott, which offered attendees a memorable opportunity to connect with KuCoin Global Brand Ambassador while watching tournament play from the suite’s outdoor balcony. Adam joined a quick Q&A session with Tika, sharing his experiences with professional golf training methods and technical skills, as well as the shared values between himself and KuCoin—values that mirror KuCoin’s commitment to building a secure, resilient, and innovative trading infrastructure. The activation fostered meaningful interaction with KuCoin leadership and strengthened local relationships, underscoring the company’s focus on trust, innovation, and user empowerment in the crypto industry. “This partnership with the Australian PGA Championship was a tremendous success, blending the precision and tradition of golf with KuCoin’s forward-thinking approach to cryptocurrency,” said Tika LUM, Head of Global Institutional Business Development at KuCoin. “It was an honor to host our partners and clients in such an iconic setting, and Adam Scott’s involvement truly elevated the experience.” Building on this momentum, KuCoin continues to deepen its investment in Australia. The company recently secured registration as a Digital Currency Exchange (DCE) provider with AUSTRAC, introducing new compliance requirements and improving fiat access for Australian users. In addition, KuCoin has established a new office in Sydney’s CBD and appointed James Pinch as its Australian Managing Director to lead local operations across compliance, operations, cybersecurity, and product development. These developments reflect KuCoin’s long-term commitment to building a secure, user-centric digital asset ecosystem in Australia and supporting the country’s evolving Web3 landscape. About KuCoin Founded in 2017, KuCoin is a leading global crypto platform built on trust, serving over 40 million users across 200+ countries and regions.

In its post, Binance argued that when the trading volumes of seven major crypto exchanges were examined, direct flows from illicit wallets were at extremely low levels, and that Binance, despite having much higher volumes, had the lowest exposure in the industry. However, according to Chainalysis, the picture isn't that simple. The company stated in a statement that Binance's analysis only calculated direct illicit flows, excluding critical categories such as ransomware, hacked funds, and indirect transfers through intermediate wallets. The statement included the following: “For example, if an illicit wallet first sends funds to a personal wallet and then to Binance, this will not show up in the analysis.” Chainalysis noted that these “wallet chain” methods are widely used by criminals, but can often be traced with the right analytics tools. According to the company's data, $2.2 billion in crypto assets stolen through hacks last year alone reached $1.7 billion. Binance updated its blog post on November 19 following criticism, stating that the analysis was created by the company's own team using Chainalysis and TRM Labs datasets, and that only direct exposure was taken into account in the calculation. Chainalysis's warning comes as Binance has recently been trying to signal stricter regulatory compliance. In 2023, the company paid $4.3 billion in fines for violating anti-money laundering rules, conducting unauthorized money transfers, and evading sanctions. Then-CEO Changpeng Zhao was sentenced to four months in prison but received a presidential pardon in October. Related News: Altcoins with the Most Buybacks in the Last 30 Days Revealed TRM Labs, another analytics firm cited by Binance, also issued a critical statement on the matter. The company's global policy director, Ari Redbord, stated that the 0.018% rate cited by Binance was a “snapshot” of Binance's exposure in June 2025, limited in scope, and only addressed direct exposure. Redbord noted that this figure was not taken from TRM's publicly available reports, but rather from a dataset provided exclusively to Binance: This number did not come from a publicly available TRM report. It was taken from a dataset provided exclusively to Binance. Binance has full discretion in interpreting and framing it. *This is not investment advice.

By press time, the asset was valued at $2.20, having gained about 0.8% in the past 24 hours, while on the weekly timeline, the asset is up almost 9%. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold XRP price on Christmas Day To determine how the asset might trade on Christmas 2025, Finbold consulted OpenAI’s artificial intelligence model, ChatGPT , which cited several factors likely to influence the asset’s price. According to ChatGPT, one of the key factors influencing XRP’s price is the resolution of its legal dispute with the SEC. With regulatory uncertainty removed, institutional investors are more likely to enter, supporting a higher baseline price for XRP. At the same time, the launch of XRP investment vehicles like ETFs and ETPs has also played a role, though early flows have been modest. These products offer increased structural demand, and as they attract more capital, they could support future price gains. Additionally, active treasury and SPAC buying programs aim to raise over $1 billion to purchase XRP on the open market. If these initiatives begin executing buybacks in December, they could provide steady upward pressure on the price. The model also pointed to broader market conditions that also impact XRP. While the crypto market faced weakness in November 2025, a potential rebound in December, especially if the U.S. The Federal Reserve signals a rate cut, could boost investor sentiment and drive XRP’s price higher. XRP price prediction By considering these factors, ChatGPT predicts that XRP will be valued at approximately $3.10 on December 25, with an expected range between $2.40 and $4.50. The most likely price will sit between $2.60 and $3.60. If these factors align positively, XRP could push past $3.50, with the possibility of reaching as high as $4.50. On the other hand, if macro conditions remain weak or delays occur in ETF or SPAC activity, the price could fall below $2.20. XRP price prediction for December 25.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-xrp-is-still-not-bearish-in-the-slightest-heres-why/,"XRP continues to trade in a narrow range as it moves through the final stretch of 2025. The price has stayed steady on the weekly chart while many indicators have cooled off. This has created an unusual mix of stability and low momentum. Charting Guy (@ChartingGuy), a technical analyst on X, shared his view of this setup and explained why he still sees strength in the current structure. His post focused on support, the behavior of the RSI, and what the pattern signals for XRP. $XRP is still NOT bearish in the slightest building support on prior cycle high as well as top of golden pocket the chart where people show you monthly RSI losing steam.. why didn’t they show you all that in January 2025 when RSI topped? RSI lost momentum ALL 2025 while… https://t.co/EZ2Oz1cpCV pic.twitter.com/ETtrwt1CLx — Charting Guy (@ChartingGuy) November 27, 2025 Support at Key Levels Charting Guy said XRP is “still NOT bearish in the slightest,” reaffirming his conviction in the asset’s trajectory . He pointed to price action on the weekly chart and said XRP is building support on a prior cycle high. He added that it also sits on the top of the golden pocket. These levels often act as strong support zones in trending markets. Also, they help show whether buyers remain active. The chart he shared places XRP above the 0.786 Fibonacci level. Its price has tapped this region several times without breaking below it. This zone used to be a major resistance . Now it serves as support. That shift can play a key role in market structure. Charting Guy’s view is that XRP still respects this structure and continues to move in a stable range. RSI Slide Through 2025 Charting Guy questioned why some users now point to the monthly RSI. He asked why analysts did not do this in early 2025 when it peaked. He said the indicator lost momentum throughout 2025, even as XRP stayed in the same price band. While some experts believe the RSI indicates a bullish resurgence , the analyst’s pattern shows a long momentum reset without a price drop. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This pattern often shows up when a market slows down to reset. The RSI can fall for months while the price remains stable. This is a signal of easing selling pressure. It also shows that buyers still control the range. Reaccumulation Structure and Outlook Charting Guy called the setup a “very textbook reaccumulation signal.” Momentum cooled, but the price held its range and stayed above key Fibonacci levels. XRP defends support. This shows that buyers continue to step in at these levels. XRP remains stable despite weak momentum readings through 2025. Charting Guy noted that the structure has not broken, and buyers continue to support the range. If XRP holds these levels, the pattern may create room for a stronger move when momentum returns .
