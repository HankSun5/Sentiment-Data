The cryptocurrency’s value fell by more than 30% over the week, crashing to as low as $1,850 on Friday, February 6. Amid the Ethereum market downturn, a significant development has emerged — one which could make or mar the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. Ethereum Breaches Realized Price Across All Investor Cohorts In a recent post on Quicktake, on-chain analyst MorenoDV shared a shocking development within the Ethereum network. The analyst highlighted that the Ethereum price recently slipped below the cost basis of multiple investor groups. The revelation is based on the Realized Price by Balance Cohorts metric, which monitors the average on-chain cost basis of Ethereum holders. The metric groups these investors by wallet size, showing where these cohorts are holding profitably or running at losses. In the chart above, we see the Ethereum price break beneath multiple cost bases (represented with yellow, green, blue, and purple lines). The most striking, however, is the loss of the realized price of the largest holders (with 100k ETH and above stored), which stands at around $2,074. Historically, the realized price of this investor class (with more than 100k ETH in holdings) has taken on dual roles for the Ethereum price, depending on its trajectory. According to data from 2019, mid-2020, and late 2022 price actions, whale realized price typically takes on a role of formidably resisting price during downtrends; during uptrends, it interestingly acts as reliable support. Hence, at periods where the Ethereum price stabs through the whale realized price to the downside, MorenoDV explained that two potential paths typically emerge. In his words: “either a violent snap-back rally as the level flips to support (2020, 2022), or further capitulation into multi-year lows (2018-2019).” Major ETH Price Levels To Watch Because the Ethereum price went through all investor cohorts’ realized prices at the same time, there is something worth noting here. MorenoDV pointed out that smaller holders collectively have their realized prices between the $2,534 – $2,675 range. Thus, should the Ethereum price attempt to recover previous legs, the $2,534–$2,675 price range will pose significant resistance to that effort. However, the aforementioned range is not the most critical one for the Ethereum price. The analyst highlighted the whale cohort’s realized price , which is approximately $2,074 — to be the most critical for the Ethereum price. Following previous extrapolations, a reclamation of this level would likely follow historical trends and push prices upwards, while failure to retake this level within a period of 30 – 45 days would precede significant drawdowns. In the event that the latter scenario holds true, the Ethereum price could swiftly fall to $1,800, or even lower. If price breaks beneath $1,800 and is sustained below this level, MorenoDV hypothesizes that this could lead Ethereum to the $1,600–$1,300 levels. As of this writing, Ethereum stands at a valuation of $2,030, reflecting an over 7% jump in the past 24 hours.",Ethereum|ETH|ethereum price|ETHUSDT,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-02-07 20:30:42

The signal emerges after prolonged selling pressure that has gradually diminished over recent weeks. The cryptocurrency has declined steadily since its September peak. Recent price action displays shorter candle bodies and reduced momentum, indicating possible seller fatigue. However, technical analysts warn that this development does not signal a trend reversal. At press time, DOGE trades near $0.09835 following a 0.08% decline in the past 24 hours. This bounce reflects a reaction to established support levels rather than a fundamental change in market structure. Price Remains Trapped Within Descending Channel The asset continues moving within a descending regression channel that has governed price action for several months. This pattern limits upside potential while providing structural boundaries for trading activity. Support currently holds at $0.080, a zone where previous selloffs lost momentum. This level represents critical defense for bulls attempting to prevent further deterioration. Above current levels, resistance sits at $0.117. This threshold has rejected multiple recovery attempts since November. Traders view this level as essential for any sustainable reversal. Breaking above it could open the path toward $0.153, which aligns with the channel's upper boundary and previous distribution zones. The TD Sequential indicator operates as a momentum tool that identifies potential exhaustion points. While useful for timing entries, it does not override prevailing trend direction. The signal suggests reduced selling intensity rather than imminent bullish control. On-Chain Metrics Point to Accumulation Behavior Spot Taker Cumulative Volume Delta remains positive despite extended price weakness. Aggressive buy orders continue exceeding sell orders, demonstrating persistent demand at lower price levels. This metric reveals market participants are absorbing available supply rather than liquidating positions. The pattern contrasts sharply with panic selling episodes where CVD typically turns sharply negative. Buyers are not aggressively pushing prices higher. Instead, they enter positions methodically as sellers reduce activity. This dynamic supports the notion of quiet accumulation through absorption rather than speculative enthusiasm. Exchange netflow data reinforces this narrative. DOGE recorded approximately $7.7 million in outflows recently. Tokens leaving exchanges during weakness suggests holders are moving assets to cold storage rather than preparing for distribution. Reduced exchange supply limits immediate selling pressure. However, these flows do not confirm aggressive institutional accumulation. They simply indicate diminished willingness to sell into current price levels. Combined with positive CVD readings, these conditions reduce the probability of forced liquidation cascades. Absent new catalytic selling events, downside acceleration appears less likely from current levels. Open Interest rose over 5% to approximately $1.04 billion while price remains compressed. This increase indicates traders are adding leveraged positions near support rather than closing exposure. Rising OI without a directional breakout typically amplifies volatility risk. Both long and short positions appear active, suggesting market participants anticipate significant movement. The current positioning creates elevated liquidation sensitivity. A decisive break above resistance or below support could trigger rapid, leverage-driven price expansion in either direction. Funding rates remain near neutral, suggesting a balance between bulls and bears. Neither side has established clear dominance, contributing to range-bound conditions.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,DOGE|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-02-07 20:45:53

Many are moving away from older, slow-moving projects and focusing instead on new crypto protocols with real use and easy-to-understand technology. Practical development is starting to matter more than past reputation. One story gaining attention centers on a new crypto decentralized finance project preparing for a broader public launch. Analysts suggest it could outperform much of the market as adoption grows. The interest is not driven by hype alone. The project is building a strong technical base for long-term use. What is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)? Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a fresh platform being developed to change how crypto lending and borrowing works. It aims to let users keep their assets while still accessing liquidity. Instead of selling tokens, users can supply them to earn yield or use them as collateral to borrow. The protocol is planned around two models, Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). The P2C model is intended to use shared liquidity pools with automated rates, while the P2P model is designed to allow users to agree on custom terms directly. Both models are still under development as the platform continues to roll out. This project has already gotten extremely successful in its initial presale phases. It has a value of over $20.4 million raised and above 19,000 holders. At this point, the project is at Phase 7 of its distribution. The token is valued at $0.04 which is a 300% improvement of the initial value. The window of early entry is rapidly closing with the official launch price being pegged at$ 0.06. V1 Protocol Professional Security and Launch This new release of the V1 protocol into the Sepolia testnet is one of the largest sources of the hype. It is an open source development of the platform on which the user can test the features on a live platform. The ability to see a functional product prior to the launch of the mainnet is a big indicator of advancement. Another priority of the team is security. The protocol was able to complete a deep audit by Halborn , a global leader in blockchain safety. It has also achieved high rating at CertiK, and has a bug bounty of $50,000. Due to this technical preparedness, analysts report a first price target of $0.12. As the protocol would switch to the mainnet, many investors believe MUTM would be increased 300% as the current level. Growth Drivers The key part of the system is the mtToken. When you lend assets, you receive these tokens as a receipt for your deposit. They are yield-bearing, which means they increase in value over time as borrowers repay interest. The project also supports the MUTM token through a buy-and-distribute model. A portion of the fees generated by lending activity is planned to be used to buy back tokens from the market. These tokens are then returned to the community. To keep participants engaged, the platform includes a 24-hour leaderboard. Each day, the most active contributor can receive a $500 bonus, adding an extra incentive for ongoing participation. Analysts have a second price forecast of $0.28 based on these demand drivers. It would be a great addition since more individuals would lock their tokens to get rewards. The $1.00 Path Mutuum Finance has a very ambitious roadmap. The group intends to roll out its own overcollateralized stablecoin. This will make the process of borrowing even easier and stable to the users. They are also transiting to Layer-2 networks in order to make transactions faster and significantly cheaper. The strategies are necessary in achieving a global market. Analysts estimate that these moves may take the price to a third target of $0.45 which would be a more than 1,000% improvement on the starting price. Others even project to the level of the $1.00 mark by 2027 in the event the protocol turns into a standard in the DeFi world. Phase 7 is selling out fast and coining an increased demand in the project. Recent reports indicate a number of whale distributions, and the big investors make huge capital investments into the project. The fact that whales come at this point is a big indicator that there is a lot of confidence in the launch. This is an essential fact since the 50% discount in comparison with the launch price, which is $0.06 will not be lasting. The demand to enlist is peaking as the supply of $0.04 is almost eliminated. The next big crypto step on the list of what many would consider to be a path towards the summit of the market is the transition of the testnet to the official mainnet.

In the United States, lawmakers and regulators now focus intensely on how clear digital-asset rules could shape the future of cryptocurrency adoption . This growing urgency has captured investor attention, especially among those who believe regulation could unlock the next major phase of institutional participation. Lord XRP spotlighted this momentum after sharing footage from a February 2026 congressional discussion that emphasized the need for firm legislative structure in the crypto sector. His post reflects a broader conversation in Washington surrounding the proposed Digital Asset Market Clarity Act , a bill designed to define oversight, reduce uncertainty, and create consistent operating standards for blockchain-based assets. BREAKING CLARITY ACT INCOMING. LETS SEND #XRP TO THE MOON!! pic.twitter.com/OqtXkRdcAe — Lord XRP (@Bitforcoinz) February 7, 2026 The Rising Demand for Clear Crypto Rules U.S. policymakers increasingly agree that digital-asset markets cannot mature without transparent regulation. Legislators aim to establish defined responsibilities for regulators, clarify how different tokens receive classification, and provide safeguards that protect investors while allowing innovation to continue. Supporters believe structured rules would encourage responsible growth and prevent the confusion that has slowed adoption in previous years. This push for clarity also reflects global competition. Countries with friendlier crypto frameworks already attract investment and talent, which increases pressure on U.S. lawmakers to act quickly. As a result, regulatory certainty has shifted from a theoretical goal to an immediate political priority. Political Signals and Industry Friction Recent congressional testimony reinforced the urgency of passing comprehensive legislation. Officials warned that the market cannot progress safely without clear rules and suggested that jurisdictions with established crypto frameworks could attract participants if the United States delays action. These strong statements highlight how seriously policymakers now treat digital-asset regulation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 At the same time, disagreements within the crypto industry reveal the complexity of reform. Companies, exchanges, and advocacy groups continue to debate how rules should apply to stablecoins, trading platforms, and decentralized finance. These tensions slow the legislative process, yet they also show how significant the outcome could become for the entire sector. Why XRP Stands at the Center of Attention Regulatory clarity holds special importance for XRP because past legal uncertainty shaped investor perception of the asset. Clear market-structure laws could remove lingering doubts and make it easier for financial institutions to explore blockchain-based payment solutions connected to the XRP ecosystem. Greater certainty often encourages long-term capital, which can influence both adoption and market sentiment. Supporters now interpret the legislative push as a potential turning point . They argue that regulation could transform from a barrier into a catalyst for mainstream integration. Whether this shift ultimately drives dramatic price movement remains unknown, but policy direction now plays a decisive role in shaping expectations. For XRP holders and the broader crypto community, the message feels clear. The next major market chapter may depend less on speculation and more on the rules that define how the industry operates.

The move follows an announcement by prosecutors in Istanbul confirming the seizure of approximately €460 million in assets linked to Veysel Sahin, who is accused of running unlawful online gambling platforms. While officials initially declined to identify the crypto issuer involved, Tether later confirmed it had blocked the funds tied to the investigation at the request of authorities. Tether Confirms Cooperation With Law Enforcement Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said the company acted after reviewing information supplied by law enforcement agencies, stressing that compliance with local and international laws remains a core part of its operations. “Law enforcement came to us, they provided some information, we looked at the information and we acted in respect of the laws of the country,” Ardoino reportedly said. “And that’s what we do when we work with the DOJ, when we work with the FBI, you name it,” he added, highlighting the firm’s broader cooperation with regulators worldwide. Growing Crackdown On Underground Finance The Turkish investigation forms part of a wider effort to dismantle underground gambling and payment networks, with authorities reporting more than $1 billion in assets seized through related probes. Analysts note that stablecoins are increasingly being scrutinised due to their use in cross-border transactions that can bypass traditional banking oversight mechanisms. Stablecoin Blacklisting On The Rise Blockchain analytics firm Elliptic has reported that stablecoin issuers, primarily Tether and Circle, had blacklisted roughly 5,700 wallets by late 2025. Those frozen wallets were estimated to contain around $2.5 billion, with approximately three-quarters holding USDT at the time restrictions were imposed. Tether has stated that it has assisted in more than 1,800 investigations across 62 countries, resulting in $3.4 billion in frozen USDT linked to alleged criminal activity. Market Growth Continues Despite Scrutiny Despite ongoing regulatory pressure, USDT continues to grow rapidly, reaching a record market capitalisation of $187.3 billion during the fourth quarter of 2025.

Companies like Tesla, meanwhile, are still expecting improved access to India’s expanding market because electric vehicles are not covered by the pact. The agreement has significant implications for high-end American automobiles. India will reduce taxes on gasoline-powered vehicles with displacements of more than 3,000cc. Buyers currently pay up to 110 percent in duties. Over the next ten years, those taxes will be reduced to 30 percent under the new accord. All import taxes will be eliminated for Harley-Davidson motorbikes. A $500 billion commitment for closer ties President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi worked together to hammer out the agreement. The agreement functions as a commercial agreement between the two nations. The present 50 percent tariff on goods originating from India will be reduced to 18 percent in the United States. In exchange, India has pledged to purchase $500 billion worth of American goods. India also consented to reduce its oil purchases from Russia. India’s commitment to forging closer connections with the United States is demonstrated by the $500 billion pledge. India is prepared to spend more for strategic and political reasons as a result of the switch from cheaper Russian oil to more costly American energy. Electric vehicles shut out of agreement The most surprising part of the deal is what got left out. Electric vehicles will not get lower taxes, even though Tesla’s Elon Musk has spent years asking Indian officials to reduce import duties. He has argued that the high taxes make his cars too expensive for Indian customers. By keeping EVs out of this trade deal, Indian leaders made their position clear. Foreign electric car companies will only get special treatment if they build factories in India. The government appears to be protecting India’s own electric vehicle industry. The Union Budget for 2026-27 showed this strategy clearly. The budget removed import taxes on 35 different types of machinery used to make lithium-ion batteries. It also provided tax breaks for equipment that processes important minerals needed for batteries. A senior official from the Ministry of Heavy Industries explained the reasoning behind the decision. “The goal is not just to import technology, but to build the ‘ore-to-magnet’ value chain within our borders,” the official stated. By keeping taxes high on finished electric cars but making it cheaper to buy factory equipment, India is pushing global companies to choose between paying heavy duties or building local factories. Compared to another trade pact India recently worked on, the American arrangement appears to be different. India made better conditions in negotiations with the European Union. Deeper tax cuts, down to 10 percent, were negotiated with the EU and extended to more vehicle categories. Those discussions also covered several electric models. Former trade negotiator Rajesh Agrawal drew attention to the distinction between the two agreements. “This framework demonstrates that India is willing to be flexible on traditional sectors, but will not compromise on the future of mobility,” he stated. “The U.S. deal is a pragmatic trade-off: American engines for Indian textiles and chips.” The comparison demonstrates how India’s approach to trade negotiations varies according to the partner. The goal of the EU accord was to link industries in a variety of sectors. The US agreement focuses more on energy security and cooperation to counter certain foreign economic practices. Soon after both nations sign the final documents in March 2026, the new tariff rates will go into force. American automakers Ford and General Motors now have a new chance to sell high-end cars in India, a market that has proven challenging to access due to strong protectionist regulations. Indian customers will likely notice the changes quickly. Powerful sports cars and expensive motorcycles from America will become more affordable. However, the country’s push for cleaner transportation remains focused on vehicles made inside India. The agreement favors traditional gasoline-powered vehicles while keeping the door closed on imported electric cars. This creates an odd situation where high-emission luxury vehicles become cheaper while the move toward cleaner technology depends on meeting local manufacturing requirements.

Whale Alert, a blockchain tracking service, identified a transfer of 203,556,622 DOGE tokens, valued at approximately $20 million, from an unidentified wallet to Robinhood's platform within the past day. The transaction represents one of several large-scale movements recently observed in the Dogecoin network. Just days earlier, on February 4, another substantial transfer occurred when 277,731,894 DOGE worth $29.5 million moved from an unknown source to the same exchange platform. These transfers come as Dogecoin experienced a notable price recovery, gaining nearly 0.04% in value over the last 24 hours to trade at around $0.09855 at the time of writing . The rebound marks a reversal from the downward pressure that characterized trading earlier this week. Market Volatility Grips Cryptocurrency Sector The broader cryptocurrency market has struggled to regain stability following a severe October sell-off that eroded investor confidence. Major digital assets have faced sustained selling pressure as market participants continue to exit positions. This week brought intensified volatility across the crypto space. Leveraged positions unwound rapidly, creating cascading effects throughout the market. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other leading cryptocurrencies recorded significant declines as traders reduced exposure to risk-oriented assets. The timing of these whale transfers coincides with broader market turbulence. Investors have shown increasing caution, rotating capital away from speculative investments toward safer havens.

According to data, the cryptocurrency market has seen $1 trillion worth of capital flow out since mid-January. With no doubt about the emergence of the bear season, investors are now approaching the market with greater skepticism and caution. One of the on-chain metrics highlighting this shift in behavior is the Bitcoin taker buy ratio, which has fallen to new lows. BTC Taker Buy Ratio Drops To 0.48 In a new Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, market analyst CryptoOnchain shared a fresh on-chain angle to the ongoing selling pressure in the Bitcoin market. This observation is based on the declining Taker Buy Ratio on Binance, the world’s largest centralized exchange by trading volume. Related Reading: Why The Market Cap Argument For XRP Price Not Reaching $10,000 Is ‘Flawed’ The Bitcoin Taker Buy Ratio is a sentiment indicator that estimates the proportion of trading volume owned by buyers against that of the sellers. Typically, values below 1 signal that taker sell volumes (aggressive selling) are outpacing taker buy volumes, which implies that sellers are overwhelming the buyers in the market. Highlighting data from CryptoQuant, CryptoOnchain revealed that the Bitcoin Taker Buy Ratio (14-day Moving Average) on Binance has dropped to 0.48, marking its lowest level since October 2025. Such a negative market sentiment on the world’s largest exchange spotlights a worrying trend in the general derivatives market. CryptoOnchain said: A drop to such a significant low suggests that sellers are overwhelmingly dominating the order book, aggressively hitting bids without sufficient buying resistance. As the crypto pundit also pointed out, this drop in the Bitcoin Taker Buy Ratio coincided with the recent price correction, which saw the premier cryptocurrency fall to around $61,000. CryptoOnchain noted that this metric needs to stabilize and begin to rise again if the BTC price is to see any relief. The Quicktake post concluded: For a potential reversal or a local bottom, we need to see this metric stabilize and begin to trend upwards, indicating that aggressive selling is exhausted and buyers are stepping back in. Until then, caution is advised as the momentum remains heavily in favor of the bears. Bitcoin Price At A Glance After one of the largest “red” days in the crypto market, the price of BTC appears to be recovering nicely, having returned above the $70,000 on Friday. As of this writing, the flagship cryptocurrency is valued at around $70,263, reflecting an over 11% price jump in the past 24 hours.

Instead, it’ll be about the 13F filings that are expected to be due on the same date, and people will be looking for answers as to how the October 10 crash happened. Technically, while 13F filings are due 45 days after the end of the calendar year, that date this year falls on a Saturday. Then, there’s another federal holiday (Presidents’ Day) on Monday, February 16. Hence, the SEC deadline automatically rolls over to the next business day, which is February 17. The 13F filings and why they are trending As the world inches closer to Valentine’s Day, anticipation of the Form 13F filings has continued to rise, with users on X speculating that it could reveal the cause of the October 10 crash. Form 13F filings are mandatory SEC disclosures, and they concern institutional investment managers with over $100 million in US equity AUM. They disclose long positions in stocks/ETFs quarterly, and are usually filed within 45 days of a quarter ending. The filings for Q4 2025 are expected to drop on February 14, 2026, Valentine’s Day, and according to speculation on X, many expect the filings could reveal if a major institutional player had massive exposure to BTC via spot ETFs or related equities and was liquidated heavily around October 10 or in the aftermath. The filings could reveal a smoking gun in the form of an unexplained disappearance of large holdings, sharp reductions in ETF positions, or even anomalies in filings from HK-based or other filers with outsized crypto allocations. With this, people could more accurately infer who got wrecked in the crash, especially if there were any TradFi players involved. While the filings are highly anticipated, it is not confirmed that they will be able to provide a definitive explanation for the crash. However, TradFi positions are opaque enough to fuel the theory that the Valentine’s Day filings might narrow down the present suspects or show structural shifts. Speculation on who or what caused the crash On October 10, the crypto industry endured what many are now calling its largest single-day liquidation event. It saw over $19 billion in leveraged positions forcibly closed within roughly 24 hours, and BTC dropped sharply while many altcoins plunged even harder. The cascade effect was extreme, and even now, months later, the industry is still talking about it. Initially, the crash was linked to macro/geopolitical factors. However, it has become apparent that the crypto sector suffered the most. It did not help matters that industry leaders like OKX’s CEO pointed accusatory fingers at Binance , blaming their handling of risky asset positions. Wintermute’s CEO, Evgeny Gaevoy, has expressed skepticism that the crash from October 10 had anything to do with an exchange or market maker blowing up. “Maybe somebody blew up but there are simply no spillover effects for us to care,” Gaevoy wrote on X. “When 3AC blew up post terra everyone knew fairly soon because it spread via DMs. Sure it was shock and disbelief at first but it lasted maybe 2-3 days all in all.” Gaevoy also talked about how the situation was similar to FTX. According to them, it took longer for people to know, but it apparently also became very obvious when it was revealed they were in talks with Binance. “You don’t talk about bailouts/investments unless there is something very wrong,” Gaevoy wrote. Franklin Bi, a general partner at Pantera Capital, speculated that the crash can be linked to “someone large outside of crypto, likely based in Asia, with very few crypto-native counterparties.” He claimed this is “why no one has sniffed them out on CT.” In response to that train of thought, Gaevoy wrote , “Who would give 90 day conditions on somebody blowing up is what is unclear to me here.” A user named TheOtherParker on X echoed Franklin Bi’s sentiment about it being somebody large outside crypto that is also likely based in Asia, who was wrecked. “As @FranklinBi pointed out, the fund(s) being non-crypto would explain why no one sniffed them out. They would likely have few/no crypto counterparties, meaning complete isolation from CT,” TheOtherParker wrote. “Unfortunately, if a fund had their IBIT position liquidated today, they wouldn’t have to disclose the position change until 45 days after the quarter end, so we’d be looking at mid May for the smoking gun from 13F filings most likely,” they added . Some of the most plausible sounding analogies point to “a large non-crypto entity likely based in HK.” However, the caveat remains that all of these are mostly speculation. The filings due on February 14 and dropping on the 17th will provide answers… If there are any.

In a new report, crypto communications firm Chainstory analyzed 2,893 crypto press releases published between June 16 and November 1, 2025, and found that roughly 62% were issued by projects classified as either High Risk or confirmed Scams, based on indicators such as anonymous teams, unrealistic return claims, and cross-referencing with legal and consumer scam databases. Low-Impact Updates Crypto-specific press release “wires” operate on a pay-to-play model that allows projects to buy guaranteed placement across partner media sites, and, in the process, bypass traditional editorial judgment. Unlike legacy wire services that distribute releases for journalists to evaluate, many crypto wires sell direct publication to audiences with minimal compliance checks. This effectively turns article placement into a paid commodity. Chainstory said that any crypto project with sufficient budget can secure visibility on recognizable news domains regardless of credibility. The analysis revealed that most wire content consists of low-impact announcements that would typically be ignored by newsroom editors. Nearly half of all releases, or 49%, focused on routine product or feature updates, while another 24% covered exchange listings and trading promotions. Token launches and tokenomics changes accounted for 14% of releases. On the other hand, only 58 releases, approximately 2% of the dataset, related to traditionally newsworthy events such as venture funding rounds, mergers and acquisitions, or major corporate finance activity. Promotional Hype Dominates Crypto Wire Chainstory also examined tone and language, finding that promotional framing dominates crypto press releases. Only around 10% were written in a neutral, factual style, while approximately 54% were categorized as “overstated” and another 19% as overtly promotional. The report observed that superlative-heavy language common in marketing copy remains unchallenged in paid releases, even when similar claims would be edited or questioned in reported journalism. Risk profiling of issuers revealed a heavy skew toward questionable projects. High-risk issuers accounted for 35.6% of all releases, while confirmed scams made up 26.9%. Low-risk, established projects were responsible for only about 27% of press releases, which indicates that more credible firms rely less on paid distribution and are more likely to receive organic coverage. In sectors such as cloud mining, almost 90% of press releases came from projects flagged as high risk or scams.

Internet Computer protocol price forecast for 2029 expects the token to reach a peak price of $12.20. By 2032, the price of Internet Computer might reach a maximum of $19.21. Internet Computer (ICP) is a groundbreaking blockchain network developed by the DFINITY Foundation. It aims to extend the functionality of the internet, enabling it to host backend software and transforming it into a global, decentralized computer. Internet computer blockchain incorporates advanced cryptography and innovative technology to provide scalable, efficient, and secure decentralized applications (dApps). Given its robust technology and expanding utility, the Internet Computer blockchain’s future price prospects look promising. As more developers build on the platform and adoption increases, ICP token demand will likely rise. Does Internet Computer coin have a future? How much will Internet Computer coin cost in 2026? Will ICP reach $1000? Let’s get into the current price analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Internet Computer Token ICP Price $2.51 Market Cap $1.367B Trading Volume $78.66M Circulating Supply 548.03M ICP All-time High $750.73 (May 10, 2021) All-time Low $2.23 (Oct 10, 2025) 24-h High $2.55 24-h Low $2.40 Internet Computer Network technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day period) 15.61% (Very High) 14-Day RSI 36.92 (Neutral) 50-Day SMA $3.29 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 6 (Extreme Fear) Green Days 8/30 (27%) 200-Day SMA $4.26 Internet Computer price analysis TL;DR Breakdown ICP is down ~30% from recent highs and still technically bearish. The daily momentum remains negative despite oversold relief. The 4-hour chart shows stabilization, not a confirmed reversal. ICP 1-day price analysis ICP is trading around $2.50, marginally down 0.1% on the day (February 7), but the bigger picture remains heavy after sliding from the January high near $3.60, a drop of roughly 30%. The coin is trading well below the daily mid Bollinger Band (~$3.07) and recently tagged the lower band near $2.15, signaling strong bearish control rather than a completed reset. ICPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The RSI sits near 35, still below neutral and only modestly off oversold, while MACD remains deeply negative with no bullish crossover, confirming downside momentum is slowing but not reversed. As long as ICP stays below $2.80–$3.00, daily structure favors continuation or sideways basing at best. ICP 4-hour price analysis On the 4-hour timeframe, ICP is attempting to stabilize around $2.51, up about 0.4% on the session after bouncing from the $2.20–$2.30 demand zone. Price is compressing beneath the descending Alligator averages, with immediate resistance clustered at $2.55–$2.60, keeping rallies capped. ICPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView OBV has started to curl higher, suggesting mild accumulation, while CMF remains slightly negative, showing capital inflows are tentative rather than confident. Momentum is no longer accelerating downward, but without a clean break above $2.60, this move still reads as consolidation within a bearish trend. ICP technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 2.79 SELL SMA 5 $ 2.67 SELL SMA 10 $ 2.72 SELL SMA 21 $ 3.16 SELL SMA 50 $ 3.29 SELL SMA 100 $ 3.86 SELL SMA 200 $ 4.26 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 3.13 SELL EMA 5 $ 3.21 SELL EMA 10 $ 3.21 SELL EMA 21 $ 3.20 SELL EMA 50 $ 3.46 SELL EMA 100 $ 3.84 SELL EMA 200 $ 4.44 SELL What to expect from ICP price analysis If $2.20 holds, ICP may range between $2.30–$2.60 before the next decisive move, but failure to reclaim $2.80 and above keeps downside risk alive, while a daily close above $3.00 is needed to shift the broader bias bullish. Is Internet Computer a good investment? The Internet Computer (ICP) has shown significant potential and volatility since its launch, which is common for relatively new and ambitious blockchain projects. Its technology aims to decentralize the internet and bring smart contract functionality to the web, which could have wide-ranging implications for the future of web speed. However, the market performance of ICP has been highly volatile, and its success depends heavily on the adoption of its technology and the broader market environment for cryptocurrencies. Please note that before you make an investment decision, seek independent professional consultation. Will Internet Computer reach $25? Yes, Internet Computer ICP might reach and surpass $25 after 2032. Will Internet Computer reach $50? Yes, Internet Computer is expected to reach $50. Though the current internet computer sentiment is sideways, future price movements and market cap are expected to be positive. Will ICP reach $1000? Although its ATH sits at $750.73, attaining $1000 in the foreseeable future might be impossible. ICP is down 99% from its ATH and will require a massive turnaround in market fortunes to recapture previous highs. However, current price levels provide a good buying opportunity. Where can I buy Internet Computer? You can buy Internet Computer on the crypto market via Binance, Bybit, Coinbase Exchange, OKX, KuCoin, and more . Does Internet Computer have a good long-term future? Yes, the Internet Computer coin shows a promising long-term future.

As global commerce becomes faster, more digital, and more interconnected, the limitations of legacy messaging-based systems are becoming increasingly visible. This has brought renewed attention to XRP and Ripple’s payment infrastructure that aims to enable near-instant, low-cost settlement of value. From Bank Messaging To Real-Time Settlement Rails A massive 1.5 quadrillion financial shift is quietly unfolding, and it’s already shaking the foundations of global banking. Crypto analyst Archie has mentioned on X that SWIFT, the decades-old backbone of cross-border payments, is copying Ripple’s playbook for a real-time transfer system and testing the XRP Ledger integration that could flip the script on slow, outdated cross-border payments . Meanwhile, analysts are suggesting that if XRP captures even a fraction of SWIFT’s estimated $150 trillion annual flow by 2030, the upside could be enormous, while some stated that the altcoin might surge to $3,000+. With Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin integrating directly into core banking and treasury platforms, the bridge between crypto rails and fiat liquidity is rapidly taking shape. Currently, there’s a speculation that XRP is being reviewed as a full SWIFT replacement in the US document, and trillions are flowing into the XRP Ledger. Meanwhile, banks like Citi are tokenizing, and Ripple technology is capable of leading the charge. Archie believes that Citi is already somewhere running on Ripple technology. How The Last Major XRP Breakout Took Shape A side-by-side comparison chart of XRP’s historical and current market cycles suggests that history may be rhyming once again. Analyst Archie has also pointed out that in the 2016 to 2018 cycle, the price started trading at a low level around $0.003, gradually building along a rising trendline, then dipping in the orange box, before the price exploded to highs near $3.50. During that period, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) formed a clear low around the 50 level, signaling a momentum reset rather than a breakdown. The current 2025 to 2027 cycle is showing a structurally similar pattern. XRP is consolidating around the dollar mark, following a similar trend line, with a dip marked in an orange box to $0.70, and the formed bottom closer to the 40 mark. Archie noted that the patterns in price action, the dips, and the indicator signals across cycles are repeating almost identically. While history never repeats perfectly, these recurring fractal patterns suggest that XRP may be priming for an epic bull run phase, from fractions to dollars, now potentially from dollars to triple digits, like the projected $117 range. Archie is bullish because the riddlers were right all along, and believes Phoenix will rise.",XRP|Archie|Citi Bank|relative strength index|ripple|RLUSD|RSI|SWIFT|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-02-07 22:00:04

The price increase will take the value of the HINU token from $0.00026331 to $0.00026431. The project’s pre-launch phase began on April 1, 2025, following the conclusion of the presale. Husky Inu AI (HINU) Ready For $0.00026431 Husky Inu AI (HINU) is gearing up for the next price increase of its pre-launch phase. The price increase will take the value of the HINU token from $0.00026331 to $0.00026431. The regular increases in the value of the HINU token enable the project to continue fundraising while empowering its growing community and existing token holders. The primary goal of the pre-launch phase is to secure capital, fund platform improvements, undertake market initiatives, and support broader ecosystem expansion. The project’s official launch is on March 27, 2026. However, the team is open to moving the launch to an earlier or later date. The project team will conduct a series of review meetings to determine the project’s launch date. The first two review meetings were held on July 1, 2025, and October 1, 2025, while the third is scheduled for January 1, 2026. Fundraising has seen a substantial uptick over the past few weeks, after overcoming a significant slowdown. Husky Inu AI has raised $934,630 so far, and could cross $1 million before its official launch. Bitcoin (BTC) Reclaims $70,000 As Market Rebounds The cryptocurrency market made a strong rebound on Friday as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and other tokens bounced to reclaim key levels. The flagship cryptocurrency briefly lost the $60,000 mark on Thursday, resulting in the liquidation of $1.1 billion in BTC longs. Investors began accumulating again at lower levels as Bitcoin finally saw a dip buying in force. Binance’s Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU), an insurance fund established by Binance, bought 3,600 BTC worth $250 million, for $65,000 per coin. The purchase comes after Binance’s recent announcement stating that it plans to convert $1 billion SAFU reserves into Bitcoin over the next 30 days. Several crypto hedge funds have also begun buying the dip. According to Bitwise Head of Research, Andre Dragosch, the aggregate market beta across all global crypto hedge funds hit its highest level in two years as BTC weakened. “Looks like Crypto Hedge Funds are 'buying the dip'. Aggregate market beta across all global crypto hedge funds has increased to the highest level in 2 years. Signals increasing BTC market exposure by crypto hedge funds.” BTC rebounded late on Friday, briefly crossing $71,000 to $71,605. However, it failed to push higher and slipped to $67,629. The flagship cryptocurrency rose over 4% in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) reclaimed the $2,000 mark and is currently trading around $2,009, up nearly 6%. Ripple (XRP) rallied almost 9% over the past 24 hours, trading around $1.41. Solana (SOL) rebounded and reached $89.50 before losing momentum and dropping to $85. Dogecoin (DOGE) is up nearly 6% while Cardano (ADA) is up over 6% at $0.269. Chainlink (LINK), Litecoin (LTC), Hedera (HBAR), Stellar (XLM), Toncoin (TON), and Polkadot (DOT) also recorded a strong recovery over the past 24 hours.

While the early days of meme coins produced some rapid success stories, the market looks very different now. Many investors who held popular dog-themed tokens are facing a tougher reality as enthusiasm fades. The attention that once came purely from hype is no longer enough, and users are starting to demand real purpose. At the same time, a new generation of crypto protocols is beginning to take shape. These projects are not built around social media trends. Instead, they focus on creating practical financial tools with long-term value. This steady shift of capital away from hype-driven assets and toward functional systems is becoming one of the defining stories of 2026. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading at an estimated $0.000006, and the drop in its worth appears to be brutal, having fallen more than 60% since a historic peak in 2021. The token is failing to see a reason to climb even after its huge brand name and market cap worth almost $3.5 billion. Gone are the childhood days of vertical rallies. The SHIB technical charts indicate that the levels of resistance are high at the $0.000010 and $0.000012 levels. These sections are full of vendors who are seeking to break even in years of holding. Analysts are making pessimistic price forecasts in the remaining part of the year. According to some professionals, SHIB might fall another 20% to $0.000004 in the case of the current support being lost. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) The crypto protocol now drawing attention from former meme coin investors is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . It is a decentralized platform in development that focuses on non-custodial lending and borrowing. The goal is to let users earn interest on their crypto or access liquidity without selling their long-term holdings. The project has already raised over $20.43 million and attracted more than 19,000 holders, showing steady community growth. Mutuum Finance is currently in Phase 7 of its distribution, with the token priced at $0.04. This reflects roughly 300% growth from early phases, while still sitting below the stated launch price of $0.06, which many analysts see as leaving room for further upside if development milestones continue to be met. Why MUTM May outperform SHIB First, the size of the market capital is a massive determinant in returns in the future. Shiba Inu has an already existing market cap of $4 billion. SHIB requires an additional $4 billion new money to gain by half. This constrains its potential to a large extent. MUTM is on a far earlier level. Its market cap is low hence it takes a very small amount of capital to achieve huge percentage returns. It possesses the type of growth room that SHIB had in 2020. Second, there is a difference in utility. Shiba Inu is mostly a meme coin that is driven by hype. In its effort to add features, it has no fundamental financial reason. MUTM is built around utility. It uses mtTokens, which are designed to be interest-bearing assets that increase in value as interest is paid back through the system. These tokens are meant to represent a user’s share in supplied assets rather than act as simple placeholders. The project also outlines a buy-and-distribute model in its design. Under this plan, a portion of protocol fees is intended to be used to buy MUTM tokens from the market and redistribute them to the community. This approach is focused on linking token value to platform usage, rather than relying on short-term hype often seen with meme coins. Third, it is all about timing in crypto. The reason why many early SHIB investors are moving to MUTM is that they can see the momentum. Recently, Mutuum Finance just activated the V1 protocol on the testnet. This proves the tech is ready. Investors desire to be associated with a project that is only beginning to make its way instead of a project that has already reached its climax. The Last Window and the Security Demand is continuing to build as Phase 7 progresses, with many participants aiming to secure the $0.04 price before the planned $0.06 launch level. Interest has increased as availability tightens, which is common in later distribution stages. Security has also been a key focus for the project. Mutuum Finance has completed a full audit with Halborn and maintains a strong score from CertiK, adding confidence for cautious investors. To encourage participation, the platform runs a 24-hour leaderboard, where the top daily contributor can receive a $500 bonus. Easy entry options, including card payments, have lowered the barrier to join. As meme tokens like SHIB struggle to regain momentum, more investors are beginning to look toward utility-driven projects such as Mutuum Finance.

While confirmation is still pending, the structure has not been invalidated, keeping the upside scenario firmly on the table. With key resistance levels overhead and momentum beginning to stabilize, ETH may be entering a critical phase where the next major directional move starts to take shape. Weekly Libra Formation Keeps The Bullish Case Alive On the X platform, Kamile Uray highlighted that Ethereum is currently forming a Libra pattern on the weekly chart. With the weekly candle yet to close and no invalidation so far, the bullish formation remains active and continues to be a valid scenario. Related Reading: Ethereum Bulls Must Conquer $3,050 Or Momentum Quickly Fades According to the update, confirmation of a reversal would open the door for a move toward the $4,956 high, but the price may face notable resistance along the way, particularly around the $3,445 level. Kamile Uray noted that a daily close above $2,475 would serve as the first technical signal that upside momentum is strengthening and that the recovery could continue. Failure to sustain movement above this area could delay further progress and keep the price vulnerable to pullbacks. Since the Libra formation is developing on the weekly timeframe, the pattern would only be considered invalid if Ethereum breaks below the $1,388 low, underscoring the broader, long-term nature of the setup. Ethereum Stretches Higher At $2,086 After A Sharp 22% Run According to Can Özsüer, Ethereum is currently trading around $2,086, marking a strong rally from the $1,730 area. From that level to the current price, ETH has surged roughly 22% without a meaningful correction, which increases the likelihood of short-term profit-taking. After such a sharp move, light selling pressure typically emerges as the market cools off. Related Reading: Analyst Says You’re Not Bullish Enough On Ethereum – What Does He Mean? Can Özsüer notes that any selling from this region is expected to remain controlled rather than aggressive. The ideal pullback zone lies between $1,950 and $2,000, where the price could reset without damaging the broader bullish structure. A dip into this range would be considered healthy and could set the stage for the next leg higher. Once that corrective move plays out, the next upside objective comes in around the $2,200 level. However, if price pushes straight toward the target without offering a pullback, the strategy would need adjustment. In that scenario, chasing a long position becomes less attractive, as a stronger selling wave could follow once the target is reached. If a correction does materialize, Can Özsüer suggests that a long position on the pullback would be the preferred approach.

Optimism price prediction for 2029 suggests the token could reach a maximum value of $2.40. In 2032, OP tokens will range between $2.10 and $4.60, with an average value of $3.05. Optimism’s (OP) commitment to innovation is highlighted by its support for Layer-3 solutions. These solutions enable the development of decentralized applications (dApps) on top of Layer-2 chains, contributing to the expansive Optimism Superchain. The platform’s initiatives, including introducing custom gas tokens and Plasma mode aimed at reducing onboarding and operational costs, make it more accessible for new users and developers. As the market closely watches the price movements and growth trajectory of the token, can Optimism reach $10 soon? Let’s get into the OP price prediction for 2026 – 2032. Overview Cryptocurrency Optimism Token OP Price $0.1974 Market Cap $416.37M Trading Volume $85.22M Circulating Supply 2.116B OP All-time High $4.85 (Mar 06, 2024) All-time Low $0.2519 (Dec 26, 2025) 24-hour High $0.1997 24-hour Low $0.1887 Optimism price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 15.44% (Very High) 50-Day SMA $0.2924 14-Day RSI 30.36 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 6 (Extreme Fear) Green Days 10/30 (33%) 200-Day SMA $0.4805 Optimism price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: OP is oversold on the daily, increasing chances of a short-term bounce. The 4-hour structure shows consolidation, not confirmation of a reversal. Reclaiming $0.21–$0.22 is key; failure keeps downside risk toward $0.18. Optimism 1-day price chart OP opened the session around $0.1974 and is currently trading near $0.1971 as of February 7, reflecting continued hesitation after a heavy sell-off that has already shaved roughly 30% from the late-January peak near $0.28. Price remains well below the daily Bollinger mid-band near $0.263, keeping the broader structure decisively bearish, while the lower band around $0.174 acts as the next downside gravity zone if selling pressure resumes. OPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD remains deeply negative, confirming trend weakness, though the slowing histogram suggests downside momentum is losing intensity. RSI sits near 29, signaling deeply oversold conditions, which often precede short-lived relief bounces but do not yet imply a structural reversal. Optimism 4-hour price chart On the 4-hour timeframe, OP opened near $0.1969 and is currently trading around $0.1978, consolidating after a sharp downside sweep toward $0.16, followed by an aggressive rebound of nearly 20% from that intraday low. OP is compressing within the Alligator cluster around $0.195–$0.198, pointing to balance rather than trend expansion. OPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The RSI has recovered into the mid-40s, showing improving short-term momentum, while OBV is curling higher, hinting at early accumulation. Still, price remains capped below the Alligator jaw near $0.202, and repeated rejection in the $0.20–$0.205 zone would likely expose $0.185 again.

OP is in a technical pause where oversold conditions support stabilization, but the dominant trend remains bearish unless price decisively reclaims overhead resistance with volume. Is Optimism a good crypto investment? Optimism (OP) could be a good investment if you believe in Ethereum scaling and the growth of Layer 2 solutions. However, like all crypto, it’s risky, and its value depends on adoption and market trends. Only invest what you’re willing to lose! Will OP recover? A recovery is possible, but we fear the overall bearish sentiment makes a short-term rebound unlikely. However, as the market consolidates, we expect reduced volatility, which may lead to a breakout in either direction, depending on market dynamics. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in its price. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and require unprecedented growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook.

The expert alluded to Ripple’s roadmap for institutional DeFi on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), with the firm noting that XRP is at the core of all these plans. Developments XRP Holders Should Focus On In an X post , Cypress stated that every holder should pay attention to the developments Ripple outlined in its institutional DeFi roadmap. The expert highlighted features such as native on-chain privacy, permissioned markets, and institutional lending, which are set to live in the coming months on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) . Ripple noted that with these features, the XRP Ledger isn’t just positioning itself as a chain for tokenization but as an end-to-end operating system for real-world finance. Meanwhile, Cypress highlighted Ripple’s statement about how the indirect impact that they can focus attention on is through how XRP is used in base-layer operations. These operations include reserve requirements, transaction fees, which result in burning XRP , and bridging currency in FX and lending flows. Ripple also mentioned that each feature, both the ones that are already and the upcoming ones, is not a silo but a building block for “composable financial ecosystems,” which is tied together by XRP. Ripple declared that institutional DeFi is no longer theoretical as the XRPL is delivering the infrastructure these institutions need with programmable lending, privacy-preserving collateral, and regulated token markets. The firm added that XRP sits at the center of that infrastructure as a transactional asset and also as a utility-rich protocol token that connects the pieces together. Ripple added how stablecoin FX, tokenized treasuries , on-chain loans, and smart escrows all depend on XRP’s functionality. Ripple’s Roadmap Boosts Market Sentiment Towards XRP Ripple’s institutional roadmap appears to have boosted market sentiment towards XRP, with the token one of the top gainers among the top cryptos by market cap. Specifically, this may have contributed to the spike in whale transactions during the recent dip, with 1,389 whale transactions of $100,000 or more, which is the highest in four months, according to Santiment . Furthermore, the number of unique addresses on the XRPL has surged to 78,727 in just one 8-hour candle, which is the highest in six months. This suggests a bullish sentiment not just among whales but also among retail investors. Meanwhile, Santiment noted that the increase in whale accumulation and spike in unique addresses are both major signals of a price reversal for any asset. As such, there is the possibility that the drop to $1.15 may have marked the bottom for XRP. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $1.47, up 15% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",XRP|Coinmarketcap|Cypress|DeFi|FX|ripple|Santiment|stablecoin|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRPL|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|WALLET|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-02-08 00:00:12

When charts flatten, and narratives recycle, fatigue sets in fast. Recent Bitcoin news highlights cautious positioning as traders wait for fresh catalysts. SPX6900 and Dogecoin remain widely held, yet upside feels diluted after repeated hype cycles. Large-cap meme coins now depend on renewed speculation instead of structural growth. That shift has triggered a quiet rotation. Attention is moving toward projects that offer defined entry points, visible progression, and participation before price discovery fully unfolds. That rotation explains the rising focus on APEMARS . Instead of chasing post-listing volatility, participants are positioning during presale stages with transparent mechanics. Structured pricing, scheduled progress, and visible community engagement create momentum earlier in the cycle. This approach reframes risk around timing rather than hype. As fatigue builds across established names, APEMARS captures attention as the best crypto to buy today. APEMARS ($APRZ): Why Early Momentum Matters for the Best Crypto to Buy Today APEMARS enters the spotlight as the best crypto to buy today by focusing on early participation rather than late speculation. The presale currently operates at Stage 7, priced at $0.00005576, with over $145,000 raised. More than 745 holders have secured over 6.1 billion tokens. This structure emphasizes steady adoption before listings. High-yield staking introduces long-term incentives, while predefined stage progression creates visible momentum. Instead of waiting for exchange liquidity, engagement forms earlier, building a conviction layer by layer. Momentum extends beyond pricing. APEMARS integrates a viral referral system designed to reward organic growth rather than paid hype. Participants unlock additional rewards through structured referrals, reinforcing network effects. The long-term roadmap includes scheduled token burns and ecosystem expansion, aligning scarcity with adoption. Earlier participants entered Stage 7 at $0.00005576, targeting a transparent listing price of $0.0055. That pricing gap reflects structure, not speculation, making early-stage momentum feel intentional rather than accidental. Turning $2,000 Into Early-Stage Positioning Power A $2,000 allocation at Stage 7 pricing of $0.00005576 secured approximately 35.8 million $APRZ tokens. With the intended listing price set at $0.0055, the modeled upside reflects the presale’s transparent structure. This scenario highlights timing advantages rather than guarantees. Stage progression increases pricing weekly, rewarding earlier access through lower entry levels. The focus remains on structured participation, where momentum builds gradually. Diamond hands pay off when conviction forms before volatility arrives. A Simple Path Into the APEMARS Presale Joining the APEMARS presale follows a straightforward process. Participants connect a compatible wallet and select a preferred payment method. Tokens are allocated instantly based on the active stage price. Staking options become available for long-term participants seeking yield. Referral features unlock additional incentives through verified engagement. Progression through stages is public, creating urgency without pressure. This design supports informed decisions while maintaining transparency throughout participation. SPX6900 ($SPX): Large-Cap Meme Stability Meets Slower Momentum SPX6900 remains a recognizable meme-driven asset with broad awareness. Its ecosystem benefits from liquidity depth and exchange accessibility. However, recent Bitcoin price today movements reveal slower speculative rotation into large-cap memes. SPX6900 now relies more on broader market sentiment than internal catalysts. That dynamic limits asymmetric upside during consolidation phases. Stability appeals to conservative positioning, but acceleration often requires renewed hype cycles. Feature-wise, SPX6900 maintains standard meme mechanics without significant structural innovation. Community engagement remains active, yet growth feels incremental rather than explosive. As Bitcoin news continues to influence risk appetite, SPX6900 mirrors broader sentiment rather than leading it. This places the token firmly in a late-cycle posture, attractive for exposure but less compelling for early-stage momentum seekers. Dogecoin ($DOGE): Cultural Icon Facing Diminishing Returns Dogecoin continues to dominate meme culture through brand recognition and widespread adoption. Its proof-of-work structure and broad exchange support provide resilience. However, upside potential narrows as market capitalization grows. Dogecoin’s price movements increasingly correlate with macro sentiment rather than internal development. References to Cardano price prediction or Cardano 2025 price often overshadow DOGE in forward-looking discussions. From a feature standpoint, Dogecoin emphasizes simplicity and community loyalty. That strength becomes a limitation during cycles seeking innovation. While DOGE remains relevant, traders searching for early-stage positioning often look elsewhere. Late-cycle assets depend on renewed speculation, whereas structured presales attract attention through clarity and defined progression. Conclusion Recent developments across SPX6900 and Dogecoin highlight late-cycle fatigue. Both assets remain relevant, yet upside relies heavily on renewed hype. As market participants assess positioning, the best crypto to buy today increasingly reflects timing advantages rather than brand familiarity. According to research compiled by best crypto to buy now , capital rotation often favors early-stage structures during consolidation phases. That perspective aligns with broader market behavior, including Bitcoin and alternative asset trends. APEMARS stands out through its presale performance and structured design. Stage-based pricing, visible progression, and upcoming burns support sustained momentum. Current ROI modeling from Stage 7 to listing reflects structure, not speculation. For informed participants, APEMARS offers early-stage exposure with defined mechanics. Exploration remains open while Stage 7 pricing windows still exist, reinforcing urgency through progression rather than promises.

APEMARS focuses on early-stage participation through structured presale stages. Community engagement forms before listings, creating momentum earlier than large-cap meme coins that rely on post-listing speculation. Is APEMARS considered a next 1000x meme coin? APEMARS is positioned as an early-stage project with defined progression. While some view it as a next 1000x meme coin, outcomes depend on adoption, execution, and market conditions. How does the APEMARS presale pricing work? Pricing increases with each stage. Earlier stages offer lower entry prices, rewarding early participation. The intended listing price of $0.0055 creates a transparent pricing gap. Can tokens be staked during the presale? Yes, APEMARS includes high-yield staking options. These incentives encourage long-term holding and community participation throughout the presale and beyond. Where can reliable research on early-stage crypto projects be found? Many investors reference ranking platforms and research hubs such as thebestcryptotobuynow to compare early-stage opportunities alongside established assets. Glossary of Key Terms Presale Stage: A defined pricing phase before public listing Listing Price: Targeted initial exchange trading price Token Burn: Permanent removal of tokens from supply Staking: Locking tokens to earn rewards Liquidity: Ease of buying or selling an asset Market Cap: Total circulating value of a token Referral System: Incentive model for community-driven growth Summary This article explores the contrast between late-cycle fatigue in large-cap meme coins and early-stage momentum in structured presales. It highlights how SPX6900 and Dogecoin face diluted upside due to size and reliance on hype cycles. APEMARS emerges as an early-stage alternative, emphasizing transparent presale stages, defined pricing progression, staking incentives, and community-first growth. The narrative avoids claims of superiority, instead framing APEMARS as earlier in the cycle, which supports psychological conviction and legal clarity. With Stage 7 priced at $0.00005576 and a planned listing price of $0.0055, the presale structure rewards timing and participation. The article positions APEMARS as the best crypto to buy today for informed readers seeking early exposure.

In his new report, the analyst highlighted that Solana’s market structure still remains decisively bearish, especially after its recent crash to two-year lows. Despite the downtrend, Umair Crypto believes that Solana could still build enough momentum to reach higher levels. He has shared multiple bullish and a few bearish targets for the cryptocurrency, depending on its next price movements. Solana Price Faces Sharp Downtrend Amid Key Support Losses In his recent X post, Umair shared a chart analysis, predicting that the Solana price could recover and potentially climb back above $150. He provided detailed insights into the cryptocurrency’s recent downtrend and highlighted what a potential recovery might look like if the price breaks through key resistance levels. Related Reading: Polygon Hits $3.50 Billion In Payments As Crypto Activity Expands According to Umair, Solana’s price action turned sharply bearish after breaking key support levels and crashing below $80 earlier this week. The analyst noted that SOL lost the $100 Point Of Control (POC) from the January 2024 range. As a result, the price quickly dropped toward the next POC zone between $67 and $73. This decline represented a clean move downward of about 27%, highlighting how fragile higher price levels have become amid broader market weakness. Following the price drop, Umair reported that Solana staged a modest 12% bounce from the lower zone. This movement confirmed the area as a volume-heavy region capable of temporarily attracting buyers. Despite this, the chart still signals caution, as Solana is already pulling back while trading volume continues to increase. The analyst emphasized that the combination of rising volume and price declines typically indicates a downside conviction rather than a V-shape recovery setup. Consequently, it suggests that SOL’s decline could continue, making a quick price reversal unlikely. Path To Recovery And Higher Price Targets While the broader technical picture supports a bearish outlook for Solana, Umair Crypto still believes the cryptocurrency can stage a recovery to new highs, albeit slowly. He marked the former point of control near $100.93 as a key level to watch, noting that it now acts as a resistance. According to the analyst, the best-case scenario for Solana would be to build a base within its current range, flip its daily bullish structure, and use that structure as support for any future price recoveries. Without this, any sustained trend reversal is unlikely. Related Reading: Bitcoin Edges Past Gold In Appeal, JPMorgan Says If SOL breaks above the $100.93 level, Umair Crypto predicts the next price targets would be $120.59, $128.43, $138.77, and $150.36. In his original analysis, the analyst shared an even higher target, forecasting a surge to between $200 and $210 if Solana can maintain momentum above $150.36.

To demonstrate the intense nature of the situation, Bitcoin developer Mononaut noted that this recent decline is the largest one-time reduction recorded since the country enacted a substantial ban five years ago. Moreover, reports from reliable sources noted that the drop ranked tenth among the largest percentage declines on record. Analysts raise concerns about the mining difficulty status in China Following the decline in China’s Bitcoin mining difficulty, analysts conducted research and discovered that the drop was attributed to about a 20% decrease in total hashrate over the last 30 days. Regarding this finding, Luxor Technology Corporation, a premier full-stack Bitcoin mining services provider, released data showing that its Hashrate Index dropped by 11% last week, hitting a record low of 863 EH/s, compared to October’s all-time high above 1.1 ZH/s. In attempts to explain the decline in hashrate, sources pointed to Bitcoin’s price decline as the main reason. Regarding this argument, they acknowledged that the price of the cryptocurrency has fallen by more than 45% from its all-time high of more than $126,000 in October. To support this claim, data released on February 5 highlighted that Bitcoin’s price plummeted to a record low of around $60,000 before bouncing back to about $68,800 yesterday. Higher Treasury yields, persistent ETF outflows, and a broad retreat from risk-on assets, such as stocks and commodities, fueled this sell-off. At this particular moment, SoSoValue , an AI-powered, Singapore-founded cryptocurrency research and investment platform, shared reports indicating that US spot bitcoin ETFs have emerged as net sellers this year. Another reason for the drop in China’s Bitcoin mining difficulty is Winter Storm Fern, a major, wide-reaching severe weather event triggered by an Arctic air mass clashing with Gulf moisture. This weather event in late January forced miners across diverse regions of the United States to scale back their operations to help stabilize overloaded residential power grids. At this point, the storm caused the shutdown of approximately 200 EH/s of power supply, prompting Foundry USA’s hash rate to decline to approximately 60%. As the situation worsened, Ben Harper, the Director of Derivatives at Luxor Technology, decided to weigh in on the topic of discussion. Harper stressed that hashprice, a metric that quantifies the expected daily revenue (in USD or BTC) a miner earns for a specific unit of hashrate, plummeted to unprecedented lows of $33.31 per petahash per second per day on February 2, and to an average daily low of $34.91/PH/s/day on February 1. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that miners typically use a $40/PH/s/day benchmark to determine whether to maintain operational status. The Bitcoin mining sector in China encounters several changes Regarding the recent situation surrounding Bitcoin mining in China, reports dated February 2 indicated that only miners with the latest Antminer S23 series machines are currently generating substantial returns. With this discovery in mind, data from Antpool noted that older models such as the Whatsminer M6 series and Antminer S21 units are nearing, or have already reached, unprofitability. In response to the recent decline in Bitcoin mining difficulty in China, reports revealed that the drop exceeded the approximately 7.5% seen in June last year. This decrease resulted from heatwave-related reductions in hashrate. Meanwhile, aside from the drop in June last year, analysts noted a similar case in early February 2025. Generally, sources reported that the profitability outlook for Bitcoin mining in China is deteriorating rapidly. This came after reports from Checkonchain revealed that the average cost of mining one Bitcoin is approximately $87,000 . On the other hand, spot prices are hovering near $69,000, roughly 20% below production costs. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Forbes claims that the Tesla CEO’s net worth has hit $845 billion, making him the first person to ever cross $800 billion. That’s more than Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Mark Zuckerberg (2nd, 3rd, and 4th richest people) combined. Tesla is Elon’s most recognizable work, as much as he hates it. But to get to his goal of being worth more than literal advanced economies, this guy isn’t relying on the so-called “automaker,” he is relying on SpaceX. Now already, nearly two-thirds of Elon’s wealth now comes from SpaceX. That number exploded after SpaceX took over his other company, xAI, the one that builds AI and owns the social media platform X (formerly Twitter). The deal gave the combined company a value of $1.25 trillion, based on financial records. Elon owns about 43% of it. That means his stake is now worth more than $530 billion. SpaceX takeover of xAI changes where his money comes from The xAI merger of course pushed Elon even closer to trillionaire status. SpaceX already launches satellites, builds rockets, works with the U.S. government, and runs its own defense projects. xAI brings in a powerful AI model and full control of a platform that runs on political drama and user engagement. SpaceX has already brought in more than $20 billion from U.S. government contracts, based on research from FedScout. Elon said the new merger is part of building orbital data centers, which would use satellites to run AI systems above Earth instead of inside data warehouses. Elon’s changing focus hasn’t gone unnoticed. In Tesla’s latest proxy filing, the company stated that “a majority of Mr. Musk’s wealth is now derived from other business ventures.” And boy, that is not good at all. Elon plans to take SpaceX public sometime in 2026. If he does, it could give him access to more cash and increase his ranking again. But the business itself is a mix of military contracts, satellites, and a high-cost AI model trying to go against Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic. Public investors might not want to buy into that. Tesla pay package and political power tighten the focus Elon still has a reason to care about Tesla. Last year, Cryptopolitan reported that Tesla shareholders approved a pay package that could be worth $1 trillion. But it’s not guaranteed. The deal is split into 12 tranches, and he only gets paid if Tesla hits a set of milestones. The first goal is for Tesla to reach a $2 trillion valuation, which is about $460 billion more than where it sits right now. Tesla’s board made the deal to keep Elon focused. They said it was designed to “prevent him from prioritizing those other ventures.” But Elon’s influence doesn’t stop at rockets and cars. His money is reaching into politics too. A report from Oxfam said that at least five people could become trillionaires in the next ten years. In 2024, billionaire wealth grew by $2 trillion, while poverty rates stayed almost exactly the same as they were in 1990. Oxfam’s director Amitabh Behar said, “The crown jewel of this oligarchy is a billionaire president, backed and bought by the world’s richest man Elon Musk, running the world’s largest economy. We present this report as a stark wake-up call that ordinary people the world over are being crushed by the enormous wealth of a tiny few.” Elon uses his control of X to affect politics.

Over the past year, Cryptopolitan has diligently reported that the US government has taken actual equity or governance stakes in at least 10 different businesses, mostly tied to minerals, chips, energy, and defense. These investments are going into startups, mining projects, semiconductor makers, and even a nuclear reactor developer. Some deals give the government voting rights. Others don’t. But in every case, taxpayer money is buying a piece of the company. Scott Lincicome from the Cato Institute said this kind of government buying spree hasn’t been seen outside of wartime. Howard, the Commerce Secretary, said more of this is coming. He even named Lockheed Martin as a possible target. Steel, rare earths, and semiconductors now have government money in them Let’s start with U.S. Steel. Trump only approved the company’s sale to Nippon Steel after getting a special power called a golden share. It doesn’t bring any profit, but it lets the president block decisions to shut plants, sell assets, or move the headquarters out of Pittsburgh. U.S. Steel stopped trading in June 2025 and now operates as a Nippon subsidiary. Then there’s Intel. In August 2025, the Commerce Department bought 433.3 million shares, or 10% of Intel , using $8.9 billion pulled from CHIPS Act funds and other grants. The shares are non-voting. Howard said the goal wasn’t control, but financial support. The Defense Department also went deep into rare earths. It invested in MP Materials, a company with a mine in Mountain Pass, California. The Pentagon bought $400 million in preferred stock and got a warrant that could give it 15% of the company. MP said that would make the government its largest shareholder. On the lithium front, the Department of Energy took a 5% stake in Lithium Americas, plus 5% in its joint project with GM. In return, it delayed $182 million in payments on a $2.3 billion loan. One Trump official allegedly told CNBC this structure gives taxpayers protection “if things go south.” The company’s listed in Canada and the U.S. Even startups with no revenue are getting millions from Washington Trilogy Metals, also based in Canada, has no revenue. It wants to mine copper in Alaska using a long, controversial road called Ambler Road. Trump approved the permits in October 2025. The government then threw in $35.6 million, taking a 10% stake and the right to buy another 7.5%. USA Rare Earth, which plans to dig rare earths in Texas and build magnets in Oklahoma, got a $1.3 billion loan and $277 million in grants this year. In return, it handed the government 16.1 million shares and 17.6 million in warrants. Depending on what happens with the warrants, the stake could land between 8% and 16%. CEO Barbara said this was an economic deal only. No government control. Vulcan Elements, a private company from North Carolina, joined with ReElement Technologies to create a rare earth magnet supply chain. They’re building a 10,000 metric ton factory. The Pentagon gave them $620 million, Commerce gave them $550 million, and they raised the same amount from private investors. The government got a $50 million stake, plus warrants. Meanwhile, xLight, a chip tool startup from Palo Alto, is working on free-electron lasers. In December, Commerce said it would take a $150 million equity stake if the company accepts federal funding. Pentagon now owns part of a missile business and could buy into nuclear power L3Harris, a huge defense company, struck a deal in December 2025 to get $1 billion from the Pentagon for its rocket motor division. The agreement says the division will go public in late 2026, and at that point, the Pentagon’s investment will become common stock in the new company. The U.S. is also dipping into nuclear energy. The government signed a deal in October 2025 with Cameco and Brookfield to fund Westinghouse, which builds nuclear reactors. The full project is worth $80 billion. If Westinghouse grows past a $30 billion valuation, the government can demand an IPO before 2029 and walk away with 8% ownership, according to Cameco’s COO Grant. All in, the Trump administration is using taxpayer money to buy into firms across rare earths, semiconductors, lithium, nuclear, and defense. These aren’t donations. They’re ownership deals, plain and simple. And the government now sits inside boardrooms it used to just regulate. Get seen where it counts.

That’s not a guess. That’s data from the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which traders use to see how hard a stock got hit. A reading below 30 means a stock is oversold. But this week was so brutal, both of them fell way under that. PayPal dropped to an RSI under 11. That’s insane. On top of that, the stock lost more than 24% this week. It’s the worst weekly drop PayPal has ever had. The crash came after PayPal gave a weak earnings forecast for 2026 on Tuesday.The company also announced that Alex Chriss is out as CEO.That hit investors hard.Most analysts aren’t calling it a buy, but they aren’t dumping it either. LSEG data shows the average analyst rating on PayPal is “hold.” That said, price targets show a possible 40% upside over the next year. No guarantees, though. The bloodbath this week was real. Coinbase slides 25% as Bitcoin crumbles Coinbase also made the oversold list with an RSI of around 14. It got crushed this week too. Shares fell 25% by Friday morning. That happened as Bitcoin dropped hard. Since Coinbase depends so much on crypto trading volume, it got dragged down right with it. The stock bounced a little Friday as Bitcoin recovered some of its earlier loss.But even with that bounce, Coinbase still ended the week deep in the red.Analysts are still betting big on it. Most of them rate it a buy. And the average target price shows a possible 100% gain from here. Whether or not it actually happens depends on where crypto goes next. The selloff this week didn’t stop with just those two. KKR & Co., a big name in alternative assets, also ended the week oversold. Its RSI fell below 20, and the stock dropped more than 13%. The fear here is about artificial intelligence Investors are nervous that it is about to shake up the software inudstry. Since KKR is tied to that space through its credit investments, the worry spread to them too. Even with that fear, most analysts haven’t bailed. LSEG data shows a majority still have buy ratings on KKR. And the average price forecast shows the stock could rise over 53% in the next twelve months. Again, that’s if nothing else goes wrong. Then there’s Palantir, which dropped 13% this week. It had a huge rally over the last year, but the good times stopped fast. Just like KKR, the panic was about AI. People are worried that new models will eat into older software companies’ profits. Palantir reports earnings on Monday after the close, so everyone’s watching. Rishi Jaluria from RBC Capital Markets is still bearish. Back on January 26, he kept his “underperform” rating on Palantir and stuck with a $50 target. He warned that unless something major happens in the next earnings report, the current price doesn’t make sense. Right now, Palantir has an RSI of 26.3, according to data from TradingView.

Apart from the focus on the short-term fluctuations in prices, the focus is shifting to the projects that demonstrate the apparent progress in their development and prospects in the long term. It is in this way that new leaders are usually formed. Visibility begins to develop before the prices move. In the recent debates, commentators are turning their attention to one of the new protocols that are beginning to emerge as investors re-evaluate some of the long-time market leaders and seek the future. Ripple (XRP) Ripple (XRP) is one of the most followed market assets. The share is circulating at the mid-range of $1.60 and a market capitalisation of approximately $85 billion. XRP still enjoys good brand loyalty and a high number of world wide holders. Technically, XRP has been unable to overcome major levels of resistance that lie between $1.75 and $2.00. Every action to that area has been subject to selling, decelerating action. Analysts observe that though XRP continues to dominate the conversation on cross-border payments, it is too large to enable the kind of price movement that early investors used to enjoy. Solana (SOL) Another big name in the analyst watchlists is Solana (SOL). The asset is priced at about $84 and its market capitalization is nearly $50 billion. High-speed transactions and low fees led to an early explosive buildup by Solana, and these features enabled early adopters to receive high returns. It is now mostly out of that phase of early growth. As the ecosystem keeps growing, analysts believe that the gains in the future will be more controlled than the catapult type of gains experienced over the past cycles. Similar to XRP, the maturity of Solana has prompted some of its initial adherents to seek smaller protocols like the one early SOL used. Mutuum Finance starts entering the discussion at this point of searching early-stage opportunities. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a new crypto decentralized lending protocol that is based on the construction of on-chain finance infrastructure. This project will enable users to lend and borrow crypto assets without selling them, and retain full control of their money in the form of non-custodial smart contracts. The project is at the presale stage, and the price of the token was set at $0.04 in Phase 7. Mutuum Finance has already raised over $20.4 million and has more than 19,000 holders. These numbers have been increasing consistently and not at once, which analysts tend to regard as an indicator of continued interest. The Reason Why MUTM is Tracked by Investors The similarity in the minds of early investors in XRP and SOL is common. They pre-empted mass adoption, at phases where the technology was still undergoing testing. According to analysts, much of the patterns in Mutuum Finance are familiar to many of these investors. Among the factors is the recent launch of V1 protocol on Sepolia testnet, which was publicized in an official manner. This update has verified that this system is not only theoretical but it is also live and can be tested. The users are now able to interact with core features in a risk-free environment which analysts view as one of the key steps in the lifecycle of the project. This concept of working product turnover is also where interest can get speeded up. Security Focus and Community Activity Engagement tools have also been implemented by Mutuum Finance that promotes regular participation. The 24-hour leaderboard, where daily contributors are mentioned, is one of them, which introduces an element of competitiveness to the presale process. These mechanics tend to become noticeable in subsequent presales phases. The area of security has also been a high point. The protocol has undergone a complete audit by Halborn , and further audits are intended as the protocol is being developed. This degree of preparation is important to many investors, particularly those who have had larger ecosystems such as XRP and SOL. As Phase 7 progresses and remaining allocations become fewer in number, analysts observe that it is a period in which the focus is frequently transformed into action. Looking Forward Q2 2026 Investment analysts who follow the market cycles usually find times when the three variables coincide. An operational product, a developing community, and pricing at the beginning stage. Mutuum Finance is where it is today. Although XRP and SOL continue to play a significant role in the overall market, the growth pattern has shifted. Conversely, MUTM is at the early stages of its development and the milestones in the development are piled up and the visibility is growing. It is this combination that has seen analysts put Mutuum Finance on their top crypto watchlists as a protocol to follow closely over the next few months.

While prices drift and fear dominates the market, smart money quietly accumulates, laying the groundwork for the next potential trend shift. Testing Conviction: Bitcoin In One Of Its Deepest Bear Market Zones Over the past few weeks, volatility has intensified, causing Bitcoin’s price to fall sharply. Marcus Corvinus highlighted that Bitcoin is trading in one of the deepest bear market zones in history, an area that doesn’t shout buy now but instead tests conviction and patience. These are the zones where price can drift aimlessly, bleed, and frustrate traders for weeks or even months. It’s not a sign of weakness; rather, strong hands are quietly accumulating while fear dominates the market narrative. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hits Deep Demand As Liquidity Finally Sweeps The Lows These phases are always messy and uncomfortable. Sentiment is crushed, capitulation feels endless, and confidence is at its lowest. Retail traders often panic or step aside during these times, which is exactly why these opportunities are so often missed. The real shift in trend rarely begins with hype or dramatic rallies. Instead, it starts with stabilization, absorption, and subtle recovery signals that are only visible to those who are patient. Quiet accumulation, a slowing of selling pressure, and small rebounds all hint that the market may be preparing for its next meaningful move. History doesn’t ring a bell at the bottom. It punishes doubt before it rewards belief. Marcus concludes that he is watching this zone very closely. While it won’t last forever, when it finally ends, most market participants will wish they had paid attention. The opportunity lies in recognizing the signals while others are blinded by fear and frustration. Resistance Holds At $71,000 — What It Means For Bulls Crypto analyst Crypto Candy noted that Bitcoin is moving largely as expected. As previously mentioned, a pullback from the $61,000–$58,000 zone toward the $70,000–$67,000 area was likely, and that scenario has unfolded precisely as predicted. The market reacted within this range, confirming the anticipated short-term price dynamics. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hits Deep Demand As Liquidity Finally Sweeps The Lows Crypto Candy also highlighted that although BTC touched $71,000, it was unable to close above that level on the daily timeframe. This reinforces the idea that until Bitcoin decisively reclaims this zone, short-term retracements remain the primary expectation. Looking ahead, Crypto Candy emphasized that a bullish scenario can only be considered in the short term if BTC closes above $71,000. Until that happens, the market may continue to test lower ranges, and retracements from the current zone are expected.

The move has caused sweeping fear and caution among Ethereum traders. However, some analysts are of the notion that a bullish upside will roll in soon. In a post shared on X, crypto analyst ChainHub said the current conditions point more toward exhaustion, and after massive downside comes massive upside. Related Reading: Bitcoin Edges Past Gold In Appeal, JPMorgan Says ETHBTC Structure Holds ChainHub emphasized that the ETH/BTC pair is still technically valid and has not seen any structural invalidation despite the recent price crash. Although Ethereum’s price fell much lower than many expected during the crash, it is not going to keep falling forever. He also pointed to fear levels that are now climbing to extremes rarely seen, noting that such environments always tend to appear near major turning points. “After massive fear and massive downside comes massive upside,” the analyst said. On Ethereum itself, ChainHub acknowledged that losing the $2,000 handle was important, but he highlighted the next major area of interest near $1,700. This zone is technically consistent with a broader corrective structure, and it is possible that Ethereum might not even fall that far before it rebounds. However, even if Ethereum does fall to $1,700, price action reaching this area means Ethereum is finally at a region where buyers may begin to reassert control. He linked this outlook to Bitcoin’s recent behavior. Bitcoin’s rejection at $72,000 opened the door to a retest of the upper portion of its summer 2024 demand range, which stretches from around $59,000 down to $49,000. ChainHub pointed out that this is the first significant interaction with that demand area since 2025, with Fibonacci alignment clustering around $57,000 to $58,000. This increases the odds that Bitcoin is in the process of forming a base, and that is where it establishes a bottom. Altcoins Touching Meaningful Demand Levels ChainHub also noted that Ethereum is not alone in testing critical levels. Several major altcoins, including Solana and XRP, have moved into important demand zones. Many of these altcoins have revisited August 2024 lows or filled prior wicks, areas that have not yet been broken on an initial attempt. Solana, for instance, has broken below $100 for the first time since January 2024 and recently traded at a low of $75. As noted by ChainHub, this move saw Solana finally touch meaningful demand for the first time in 2 years. Related Reading: Polygon Hits $3.50 Billion In Payments As Crypto Activity Expands Dogecoin, Cardano, and Avalanche have also all filled the downward wicks on October 10, restoring balance and touching the August 2024 low. Although there is still the possibility for limited downside, the expectation is that the market begins forming a range and then starts building bullish momentum in the coming weeks.

Compared to a pure play Ether long position, Sharplink offers some unique advantages. A closer look at Sharplink’s price and underlying fundamentals points to a compelling entry point here. From its roots as an online affiliate marketing company, Sharplink ( SBET ) has successfully pivoted into one of the largest digital asset treasury companies (or DATCOs) on the market. SBET’s treasury strategy, announced in June last year, is focused on Ether ( ETH-USD ), the Ethereum blockchain’s native currency and the #2 cryptocurrency by market cap. As it stands, SBET has accumulated a very sizeable ~863K ETH treasury (worth ~$2bn at the time of writing), making it the #2 public holder of ETH after Bitmine Immersion ( BMNR ). Strategic ETH Reserve Like most other DATCOs, SBET funds its accumulation strategy by issuing shares, when they trade at a premium to their underlying net asset value, under an amended “At-The-Market” (or ATM) Sales Agreement. This strategy paid off for a while, allowing SBET to raise well over $2bn of gross proceeds toward building its ETH stockpile. In recent months, however, sentiment has tanked, taking ETH prices to less than half of their all-time highs. Data by YCharts Along with this drawdown, SBET has seen its NAV premium (the source of its funding) flip into a deep discount. So deep, in fact, that SBET now trades at an over 20% discount to its underlying holdings - at the bottom end of its DATCO peer group. The silver lining here is that deep discounts and peak pessimism also make for good entry points, so it’s worth taking a closer look at the SBET investment case here. Blockworks SBET as a Bet on Ether 1. Ether’s Price to Fundamentals Discrepancy With the legacy gaming business now down to a mid-single-digit % of revenue, a bet on SBET today is a concentrated bet on ETH. And as ETH (the currency) is the “gas” powering Ethereum (the blockchain), you do need to be comfortable underwriting Ethereum’s future. Here, I don’t see too many issues. Yes, price action has not been pretty at all in recent months, but fundamentally speaking, Ethereum’s position as the leading smart contract blockchain remains firmly intact. DefiLlama If anything, all signs point to adoption continuing to go up, rather than down. Broadly speaking, key megatrends in the space, from the growing tokenization of “real world assets” to decentralized finance, remain centered on Ethereum. Sharplink Developer activity also remains as robust as ever - despite the emergence of innovative (and better-funded) new competitor blockchains in recent years. Electric Capital Last but not least, there’s the scaling roadmap, which, as last year’s “Fusaka” upgrade (increased block capacity, among other improvements) showed, paves the way for reduced fees and much higher throughput in the years to come. That should, in turn, allow for activity to migrate back to Ethereum from “Layer 2s” (scaling solutions built on top of Ethereum) like Arbitrum ( ARB-USD ), as well as lower fee, higher throughput chains like Solana ( SOL-USD ). Coin Metrics 2. A Multi-Trillion Dollar CLARITY Catalyst While the infrastructure is as sound as it’s ever been, ETH pricing is also a function of external forces. One of which is regulation. Today, the focus here is on the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, or “CLARITY Act.” CLARITY will firstly delineate regulatory jurisdiction between the securities regulator, the SEC (for security tokens), and the commodities regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission or CFTC (for digital commodity coins/tokens). Recall this was a major point of contention with the previous Biden administration. Bybit Secondly, CLARITY defines regulatory requirements (think registration, AML/KYC, etc.) for applications like decentralized finance and “real world asset” tokenization. Both of these pave the way for institutional participation and the opportunity to tap into “trillions of dollars” of new capital . ETH price very closely tracks the total financial value (or TVL) locked on-chain, so as TVL scales with new inflows, ETH should appreciate accordingly. DefiLlama For all the promise, passing CLARITY hasn’t been as straightforward as last year’s Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act (“GENIUS Act”), which established regulatory clarity on stablecoin (i.e., tokens backed 1:1 by equivalent fiat currency) issuers. This has weighed on the market. Bybit The most notable sticking point with CLARITY is the banking industry’s pushback on platforms passing stablecoin yield onto customers. The rationale here is that a more attractive stablecoin proposition might lead to capital flight away from the banking system, creating systemic risks. Whether the banking or crypto lobby ultimately makes the concession is anyone’s guess, but for now, a watered-down CLARITY (minus yield sharing) seems like the base case scenario. Not ideal, but still a net positive, in my view, especially with other major crypto hubs (EU, Hong Kong, UK, etc.) also converging in a similar regulatory direction. Last but not least, a base case outcome isn’t fully priced into the market (60/40 odds per Polymarket ) - despite a growing sense of urgency with midterms looming large. Thus, a potentially positive near-term catalyst worth watching out for. Polymarket SBET as a Bet on Ether Accretion 1. Invest Alongside the Ultimate Ethereum ""Insider"" There are many ways to invest in ETH today, so why SBET? Management is one big reason, in my view. At the top of the leadership team is key man and Chairman Joseph Lubin. For context, Lubin is the co-founder of Ethereum and founder of Consensys, the company that built out Ethereum’s #1 digital wallet (MetaMask), as well as its infrastructure (Infura). In other words, about as much of an “insider” as it gets in the Ethereum ecosystem. Alongside Lubin is CEO Joseph Chalom, who brings fintech and digital assets experience from BlackRock ( BLK ). Together, Lubin and Chalom bring the access and expertise to string together some fairly unique opportunities across the Ethereum ecosystem. Sharplink Take, for instance, the incremental yield SBET has been able to unlock by liquid staking ~$200m on Linea (an Ethereum “Layer 2” network backed by Consensys) in a multi-year deal. In addition to native yield (currently 2.5-3%), this opportunity allows SBET to layer additional re-staking yield (from EigenCloud) and incentives from Linea and ether.fi on top. Sharplink Then you also have opportunities with the Ethereum Foundation, the non-profit supporting protocol growth, research & development. Of particular note here is the ETH Foundation's decision to sell ~10k ETH directly to SBET - a win-win outcome. For the foundation, a direct sale to an aligned party minimizes price impact if it had decided to sell into the open market. Meanwhile, SBET gets to negotiate better trade terms for the direct sale. How else can SBET leverage its privileged position down the line? Perhaps it gets first pass at managing foundation assets down the line. Or perhaps it innovates capital raising opportunities outside of the existing $6bn facility, allowing it to fund accretive ETH purchases. Either way, there's a latent value creation opportunity at SBET, which, in my view, isn’t reflected at current prices. 2. Buy Ether at a Discount SBET is a treasury company, so most of the valuation work is already done for you on its live dashboard , which tracks both its underlying net asset value and the market Net Asset Value (or mNAV). Sharplink What isn’t here, though, is, firstly, the incremental value from SBET’s staking yield. Note that while yields are currently around 2.5%, SBET is able to get a little bit more creative here and therefore generate above average yields. The company isn’t subject to redemptions either, so there is really no hurdle to SBET staking its full ETH balance. Putting it all together, this means that even a ~3% yield assumption (conservative given SBET’s participation in L2s and re-staking), net of recurring SG&A expenses, could add quite a bit of upside going forward. Sharplink The second ‘free’ option is SBET’s future discount narrowing initiatives. For now, management hasn’t shown much intent beyond equity offerings (when mNAV >1) and buybacks (when mNAV MSTR ) has shown, treasury companies can raise funds in all sorts of creative ways; more so for SBET, given its access, via Lubin/Consensys, to virtually every part of the Ethereum ecosystem. In sum, there’s clear value here, as neither the balance sheet nor the two ‘free’ options above are being priced in at the current 0.77x fully diluted mNAV. A compelling entry point for those with patience and looking to deploy new money. Final Note on Risks & Summing Up To be clear, SBET also comes with several key risks. Volatility, derived both from the ETH price and the mNAV discount/premium, means this isn’t an investment for the faint of heart. As discussed, regulation is also a factor here, and unfavorable outcomes could negatively impact SBET’s existing investments and its ability to raise new capital. Still, there’s more than enough buffer at currently depressed prices to offset these risks and then some. Thus, I’m quite happy underwriting SBET—both as a standalone long (captures ETH upside + mNAV discount narrowing) or with an accompanying ETH hedge (only captures the discount narrowing).",ETH-USD|SBET,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|REGULATION|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2026-02-08 03:06:12

The American selected Warsh in January to succeed Jerome Powell, whose tenure concludes in May. However, investors still have concerns over his hawkish reputation. According to data from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group, the probability that markets place on a rate cut at the March Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting has jumped to about 23%, up sharply from roughly 18.4% just days earlier. Traders are pricing in a 25-basis-point reduction, a sign of growing speculation that the next Fed chair could steer policy toward easier money. The shift reflects growing speculation among traders that upcoming leadership changes at the Fed could lead to a pivot toward looser monetary policy — even as the central bank’s own policymakers are signaling caution. Traders’ bets on a March cut are notable because they suggest markets are trying to price in developments well before the Federal Open Market Committee has signaled a formal policy change. Perfumo says Warsh’s nomination gives a mixed macroeconomic message to investors and markets CME data now shows the share of investors betting on rate cuts in March at 23%. Earlier, crypto analyst Nic Purkin had noted, “The nomination of Kevin Warsh as the next Fed Chair has shaken markets to the core.” According to Puckrin, precious metals slid in late January and early February as markets reacted to Warsh’s reputation for favoring prolonged high interest rates. He argued that investors are adopting Warsh’s outlook on Fed policy, particularly his criticism of the central bank’s oversized balance sheet. He further noted that should the Fed under Warsh pursue balance sheet cuts, investors may face a more constrained liquidity backdrop. Thomas Perfumo, a global economist at cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, also said Warsh’s nomination presents a divided macroeconomic message to markets. He contended that crypto markets may need to adjust to stable, not rising, US liquidity and credit following Warsh’s nomination. This far, crypto traders on Polymarket see a 27% probability of two Fed rate cuts this year. Another 26% have wagered on three cuts in the year, while only 13% see the likelihood of four cuts. ProCap’s Park says BTC’s biggest rally may come if the asset keeps rising despite high Fed rates Crypto asset prices often track liquidity trends, rising with rate cuts and falling when higher rates reduce financing options. One crypto analyst noted that Bitcoin’s next catalyst may materialize if the market rethinks the idea that only declining rates are bullish. “I think we should expect that having more accommodative policies may, in fact, actually not be the catalyst to help us go into a bull market. We have to accept that reality and possibility,” ProCap Financial chief investment officer Jeff Park asserted. Lowering interest rates is one way the Fed sees to stimulate the economy, and Bitcoin enthusiasts see these policies as creating better conditions for riskier assets. Higher rates have been known to hurt Bitcoin, though Park suggests the next big upside for the asset — potentially its ultimate rally — could come if Bitcoin keeps climbing amid higher Fed rates, a stage he calls “positive row Bitcoin.” “This is the mythical, elusive perfect holy grail of what Bitcoin is meant to be, which is when Bitcoin goes up as interest rates go up, which is very counterintuitive to the QE theory,” he said. Nonetheless, he claimed that if that were to happen, it would compromise the risk-free rate, meaning they could no longer use traditional methods to price the yield curve. But, he also pointed out that the current monetary system is flawed, and that the Fed and Treasury aren’t working together as effectively as needed to guide national securities.

Large drawdowns have been part of the asset’s history since its earliest trading days, often followed by strong recoveries that reinforced its long-term growth narrative. For many investors, these cycles became an accepted feature of digital asset markets. Recent market corrections, however, are prompting a deeper reassessment of how crypto exposure fits within broader investment strategies. As digital asset portfolios grow and institutional participation increases, investors are beginning to evaluate not only potential upside, but also how portfolios behave during periods of market stress. Bitcoin’s drawdowns are no longer viewed purely as temporary price events. They are becoming catalysts for changes in portfolio construction. Bitcoin Volatility and Portfolio Risk Management Bitcoin’s price history has been defined by rapid expansion followed by significant corrections. These cycles have historically rewarded long-term holders, but they have also highlighted the challenges of managing concentrated crypto exposure. For investors with larger allocations to digital assets, volatility introduces questions about capital preservation, liquidity planning, and portfolio balance. When markets decline sharply, strategies built entirely around price appreciation can experience substantial swings in value. This dynamic is encouraging investors to think more carefully about risk management within crypto portfolios. Rather than relying exclusively on long-term price recovery, some investors are exploring allocation strategies designed to balance growth exposure with other participation models. The goal is not to avoid volatility, but to manage how portfolios respond to it. Diversification Beyond Bitcoin Exposure Bitcoin remains the largest and most widely recognised cryptocurrency, but digital asset markets now include thousands of tokens, decentralised finance protocols, and emerging treasury-based participation models. As the ecosystem expands, portfolio diversification is becoming more common. Investors are increasingly spreading exposure across multiple digital assets, blockchain networks, and participation strategies rather than concentrating capital in a single asset. This approach mirrors traditional portfolio construction, where diversification is used to manage market cycles. Crypto portfolios are gradually adopting similar principles as digital assets become more integrated into global financial markets. Diversification in crypto is no longer just about holding multiple tokens. It is also about combining different participation models within a single portfolio. Income Visibility Is Becoming Part of Crypto Allocation One of the most noticeable shifts in recent market cycles is the growing interest in income visibility within digital asset portfolios. Instead of relying entirely on price appreciation, some investors are exploring participation models designed to generate returns with clearer expectations. Staking rewards and decentralised lending have long provided income opportunities in crypto, but these mechanisms are typically variable. Reward rates change with network participation and market demand, which can make income forecasting difficult during volatile periods. Structured digital asset participation models are beginning to offer alternative approaches. These frameworks focus on predefined durations and scheduled distributions, allowing investors to evaluate potential outcomes before allocating capital. For readers interested in how these participation models are evolving, research examining fixed crypto income participation explores how defined-return frameworks are emerging alongside traditional crypto yield strategies. This growing interest reflects a broader shift toward portfolio allocation strategies that balance growth exposure with income visibility. Digital Asset Treasury Models and Market Cycles Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs) are becoming part of this evolving landscape. Instead of functioning purely as crypto holding vehicles, treasury models are beginning to incorporate diversification and structured participation frameworks. Blockchain infrastructure improvements are helping support this transition. Smart contracts now allow financial instruments to automate payments, track ownership, and manage redemption processes with transparency. Some platforms, including Varntix , are exploring diversified digital asset treasury models designed to support fixed-term income instruments executed on-chain. Their development reflects a growing intersection between blockchain technology and traditional portfolio allocation thinking. As crypto markets continue to evolve, treasury-based participation models may play an increasingly important role in how investors manage exposure across market cycles. Fixed Income In Crypto Is Here To Stay Bitcoin’s volatility is unlikely to disappear. Market cycles remain central to digital asset adoption and innovation. What appears to be changing is how investors respond to those cycles. Rather than relying solely on long-term price appreciation, portfolio construction in crypto is becoming more diversified and structured. Growth exposure, decentralised finance participation, and income-focused strategies are increasingly being combined within digital asset portfolios. Bitcoin’s drawdowns are not just testing investor conviction. They are helping reshape how crypto exposure is understood within modern portfolio management. Varntix is a digital asset treasury company focused on structured crypto income and on-chain convertible notes.

A crypto analyst has reported that each time XRP has reached these levels, a price bounce has followed. Based on this, he believes that XRP could be on the verge of another major rebound, projecting a potential rally above $2. XRP Price Sinks To Oversold Levels Ahead Of Rebound A crypto market analyst known as ‘Ripple Bull Winkle’ on X has outlined a short-term bullish outlook for XRP. Despite consistently breaking key support levels and now trading around $1.4, the analyst argues that XRP may be positioning itself for a substantial recovery that could ultimately push its price back above $2. Related Reading: Pundit Says XRP Price Is Not A ‘Crypto’ Question, But A Systemically Important Liquidity Asset The basis for Ripple Bull Winkle’s optimism stems from a recurring historical pattern that, in his view, has never failed to produce a bounce in the XRP price. Specifically, the analyst highlights a repeating Relative Strength Index (RSI) pattern. He announced that XRP recently reached an RSI of 20 on the daily chart, marking the most oversold reading in its history. According to the analyst, every time XRP has entered similarly extreme oversold territory, a price bounce of approximately 15-40% has always followed. He said such rebounds typically occur within two weeks of reaching these levels. He also emphasized that this recovery has not happened occasionally but consistently, reinforcing his confidence that XRP is likely to follow the same pattern and bounce again. If everything plays out as expected, Ripple Bull Winkle projects that XRP could see a relief bounce to $2.20-$2.50 before the end of February 2026. He noted that a rally to this bullish target is the highest-probability event the market has had this year. Analyst Shares Multiple Resistance Targets For XRP Looking at Ripple Bull Winkle’s accompanying price chart, he has marked several key resistance zones using red horizontal lines, indicating areas where XRP may encounter selling pressure or struggle to advance. These levels range from approximately $1.8-$1.91 to $2.06-$2.19, followed by $2.29-$2.41, $2.67-$2.78, and a higher resistance band near $3.10-$3.18.

The upward-pointing blue arrows in the chart also signal the analyst’s expectation of a bullish breakout or a sustained rally toward the stacked resistance levels if XRP builds enough momentum. As of writing, XRP appears to be recovering from its recent downtrend. Its price has rebounded by more than 10% over the past 24 hours and is currently trading above $1.4 after briefly dipping below $1.3, according to CoinMarketCap.

In his post, the analyst stated, “Until XRP price respects this channel, it’s bullish. Only diamond hands survive this type of dump.” The comment was accompanied by a weekly XRP/U.S. Dollar chart showing price movement contained within a clearly defined descending channel. The chart highlights multiple interactions between XRP’s price and the channel’s upper and lower boundaries. According to the visual analysis presented, XRP has consistently respected these trendlines over an extended period, suggesting that the broader structure remains intact despite recent volatility. XRP CAPTAIN’s wording emphasizes that temporary drawdowns, while significant, do not necessarily invalidate the prevailing technical setup as long as price action remains within the established range. Until #XRP price respects this channel it's bullish. Only diamond hands survive this type of dumps https://t.co/OxfPCABL3s pic.twitter.com/dDqb0v5IAi — XRP CAPTAIN (@UniverseTwenty) February 6, 2026 Market Volatility and Investor Conviction XRP CAPTAIN’s reference to “diamond hands” underscores the level of conviction required during periods of sharp corrections. The chart attached to the tweet shows notable downside movements, including a recent sell-off toward the lower boundary of the channel. However, the analyst’s core argument is that these declines are part of a broader pattern rather than a breakdown of the trend. By framing the analysis around structural respect rather than short-term price fluctuations, the tweet places greater importance on weekly closes and long-term behavior. This perspective suggests that as long as XRP does not decisively break below the channel, the bullish thesis outlined in the post remains valid. Community Commentary on Resilience and Transparency The post also drew commentary from other X users, including LianDAO Media, who wrote , “Price resilience here tests both charts and project transparency.” This comment linked the current market stress to broader considerations beyond technicals, implying that periods of heightened volatility can act as a test of both market structure and confidence in the underlying project. The remark aligned with the ongoing price action shown in the chart, where resilience near key levels has become a focal point for observers. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Recent Price Action Supports the Thesis Recent market data appears to align with the analyst’s view. According to CoinMarketCap data at the time, XRP was trading at $1.47, a 20.71% increase within 24 hours. This rebound followed the sharp decline illustrated on the weekly chart and indicates a strong short-term reversal from lower levels. The recovery lends weight to XRP CAPTAIN’s assertion that respecting the channel maintains a bullish bias. While the tweet itself does not provide explicit price targets, the combination of structural support and subsequent price recovery suggests that the analyst’s technical outlook has, at least in the near term, been supported by market behavior.

Q4 2025 results revealed a $12.4B net loss, driven by new fair value accounting and Bitcoin's 25–26% price drop, not operational weakness. Statistical analysis shows MSTR lacks long-term cointegration with Bitcoin but exhibits high short-term beta (1.36) and persistent volatility. I rate MSTR a strong sell—NAV premium is gone, dilution and financial stress loom, and direct BTC exposure is safer than MSTR’s structure. In recent years, Strategy ( MSTR ) became a Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) wrapper in traditional markets. For many investors, this stock seemed like a good investment instrument if they believed in Bitcoin growth; you buy MSTR and get Bitcoin on steroids. But this narrative seems to be fading. The latest quarterly earnings (Q4 2025) were, in fact, a shock to me. Not because the company’s operations were bad—in fact, they were good—but the numbers showed how MSTR’s financial results are dependent on Bitcoin price swings. Immediately after earnings, I asked myself, why do investors pay a premium for difficult corporate structures if they can’t just buy Bitcoin themselves? At first glance, MSTR and BTC seem to be the same bet. But looking deeper into the structure, these assets are completely different, with different risk profiles and different behavior in critical phases. Earnings Yesterday, Strategy announced its Q4 2025 earnings , which I would say were pretty bad. But the majority of those negative numbers were caused by accounting rather than operational events. The company reported around $12.4 billion in net loss; GAAP EPS was -$42.93 per share, which did not beat analysts' expectations at all. However, these results are more connected to Bitcoin's price fall during the quarter than business problems. The main change was new fair value accounting rules application. According to them, Strategy must revalue its Bitcoin at market price. Bitcoin in Q4 2025 was falling; it fell around 25-26%, so the company naturally was forced to report around $17.5 billion in unrealized losses. As all traders like to joke, the losses are on paper - Strategy did not sell any Bitcoin. Operational side, which somehow is secondary for many investors, was stable. Software segment generated $123 million in revenue, a little beating market expectations. But these operations clearly do not impact valuation. Strategy today is valued almost as a Bitcoin exposure instrument. Besides BTC fall, Strategy was still aggressively buying bitcoin and increasing positions. Throughout 2025, they attracted more than $25 billion in capital, and in January 2026, they bought around 41k Bitcoin, making their overall portfolio above 700k BTC, with an average price around $76 thousand per Bitcoin. Given current BTC prices, they are underwater. Overall, let’s be real, the results show that the company is highly sensitive to Bitcoin price movements. These earnings are not a traditional business cycle example; they are a leveraged crypto exposure accounting result. Seeking Alpha Why MSTR is So Volatile? One of the main drivers of why Strategy's stock price is more sensitive to Bitcoin changes than Bitcoin itself is capital structure mechanics, which today are practically forming the company’s investment model. The strategy since 2020 is constant Bitcoin accumulation. For this goal, the company is using convertible bonds and new share issuance and sometimes even convertible preferred capital issuance. Convertible bonds let them attract capital cheaper than through traditional debt because investors are choosing potential conversion into shares if the share price rises. The majority of these bonds Strategy issued to finance Bitcoin accumulation and not for business expansion or operational activities. When they buy BTC with bond or share issuance money, Strategy increases Bitcoin amount in its balance, and that increases the Bitcoin per share ratio—the thing the company calls ""Bitcoin Yield"". This ratio shows how the amount of BTC per share increases over a certain period of time. In theory this is a value creation mechanism: more BTC per share means a larger initial position base. This type of model can create a positive cycle in a bull market. When Bitcoin price is rising, MSTR share price is going even higher due to a leverage-type effect, and that in turn allows them to raise even more capital through share issuance or bonds; then the money collected is reinvested into Bitcoin and increases the Bitcoin per share ratio. I think that this model was part of the overvaluation we saw MSTR being traded at a premium to NAV. At the same time, this model has the same effect in a bear market: share issuance and debt are increasing sensitivity to Bitcoin price. Any negative BTC movement is hitting MSTR even harder. Also, when premium is falling, choices like share issuance become less attractive, and the company needs to search for alternative financing sources or increase its debt. Also, let's keep this in mind: Bitcoin yield can increase BTC per share, but shareholders are still exposed to equity risks like leverage, dilution, timing, and now NAV multiple compression; it is not the same as buying BTC. That is why MSTR can diverge materially from BTC even if BTC per share goes up. MSTR vs BTC price comparison (TradingView) Statistical Analysis As I am primarily a trader and then an investor, I manage my risks through numbers - econometric analysis. So, to answer the question I asked in the beginning, I have quantified it. I have used dates since January 2024 till today (06/02/2026). The analysis was not oriented toward price narrative but more toward statistical structure. For those that are holding the bag, this might be a good part to understand how long or if you are going to be left holding the bag. First, I have done a stationarity test, which is just a standard practice. Engle-Granger test showed a clear result: MSTR and Bitcoin price levels (log prices) are not cointegrated. In other words, there is no long-term relationship that would statistically attach Strategy value to Bitcoin price. Quite important if you were thinking about MSTR as a Bitcoin replacement. The short-term relationship is strong. Model showed that Strategy has a high and quite stable beta coefficient relative to Bitcoin - on average, 1.36. Rolling window analysis proved that this beta is not random. Variation is relatively small, but the relation remains consistent in the short term. Volatility analysis, for which I used GARCH (1,1), also standard for investments, showed very important behavior - high volatility persistence (around 0.97). In practice this means that volatility in Strategy stock tends to stay for a long time. Quantile regressions showed that beta is very high in bear or bull regimes, and that means that MSTR is not safe against Bitcoin shocks - the leverage works symmetrically. So, what does it show us? The model showed that the stock has a lot of risks. This can be seen in the Q4 2025 results. First, lack of cointegration means that Strategy is not a Bitcoin follower, while it might seem like it from the chart above. Why? Because the company is actively changing its capital structure by issuing new shares and preferred capital (for example, STRC), with a goal to buy more Bitcoin. Which detaches it from long-term Bitcoin relations. Secondly, high volatility persistence is showing exact market reality. We can see from their latest earnings that Bitcoin price shocks not only affect valuation as share prices start following, but also increase stress for the company. They have approximately $800 million in annual interest and preferred dividend obligations. This sum is made of interest payments for convertible bonds and preferred stock dividends, which were issued to finance Bitcoin purchases. These costs are fixed and do not depend on BTC price, so when crypto starts having high swings, it just increases financial stress. Finally, NAV premium is gone; the market stopped paying "" Saylor premium "" and started pricing in dilution and structural risks. All in all, the results prove that Strategy today is not a software company but a high-beta Bitcoin experiment in real time. Authors Model, Canva Summary Strategy is not a software company anymore - it is a leveraged Bitcoin structure with additional debt, share issuance, and management risks. A statistically stable long-term relationship with Bitcoin does not exist, but a short-term one is affecting the company through high beta and volatility. For those who believe that if BTC is going to go up, so will MSTR, the numbers tell a different story; it is not a miner that follows gold prices, it is a structurally difficult company. If you hold this for 5 years thinking it's Bitcoin, the math says you will drift away from the asset. Q4 results proved that volatility will affect finances really hard, NAV premium is gone, and the market is trying to price in potential dilution and financial stress. I think that at this point buying BTC is safer than investing in MSTR. Even while the stock is being traded at NAV, Strategy has strong negative risk characteristics, in my opinion, stronger than buying Bitcoin. Investors are exposed to more leverage, refinancing risk, and potential additional new share issuance, plus let's add volatility. My rating is a strong sell. It is not worth risking for the hype.",BTC-USD|MSTR|MSTR:CA,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2026-02-08 06:44:55

The data shown in the attached visuals indicated that XRP recorded a gain of roughly 25.65% over the observed period, while Bitcoin rose by about 9.06%. Based on these figures, Kwok stated that XRP outperformed Bitcoin by approximately three times on the day. In his post, Kwok explained that when two assets show diverging price action, that behavior constitutes decoupling. He stressed that this concept should not be viewed as a one-time event but as a gradual development that unfolds over time. According to Kwok, repeated divergence between assets is meaningful, as each instance increases the likelihood of a lasting separation in their trading. fyi whenever price action diverges, that’s decoupling. as i’ve always said, decoupling is a process. doesn’t happen overnight. the more times price action diverges, the closer we decouple for good. $XRP outperforming $BTC by 3x today. pic.twitter.com/YTJfgLuz8y — Dom Kwok | EasyA (@dom_kwok) February 6, 2026 Decoupling Described as a Process, Not an Instant Shift Kwok reiterated a position he has expressed previously, noting that decoupling does not occur overnight. He argued that a single trading session is insufficient to confirm a permanent change in market behavior. Instead, he emphasized that the consistency of divergence matters more than isolated outcomes. From his perspective, the fact that XRP has repeatedly shown independent price movement relative to Bitcoin is more important than any single percentage comparison. The charts attached to Kwok’s post supported this view. Both assets showed movement over the same upward timeframe, but the scale of XRP’s advance was clearly larger. Kwok pointed to this disparity as another example of price action moving in different directions or at various intensities, which he sees as part of a longer-term transition rather than a completed shift. Community Pushback Focuses on Recent Volatility Several commenters questioned whether the day’s performance truly supports the idea of decoupling. A user identified as Crockett argued that XRP’s stronger move could be explained by its earlier decline. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 According to this view, XRP had fallen more sharply than Bitcoin beforehand, making a stronger rebound more likely. Crockett suggested that this pattern does not indicate independence, adding that XRP often still reacts closely to Bitcoin’s movements, dropping when Bitcoin weakens and recovering as Bitcoin stabilizes. Another commenter, JohnnyCrackCornNIDC, referenced the prior day’s trading activity, noting that XRP had declined at a much higher percentage than many other digital assets. From that perspective, the recent gains merely offset earlier losses, leaving overall performance more balanced when viewed across multiple days rather than a single session. Differing Views on What the Data Shows Kwok’s comments highlight a clear divide in market participants’ interpretation of short-term divergence. His position focuses on repetition and accumulation of evidence over time, while critics place more weight on recent volatility and relative losses. The exchange reflects ongoing disagreement over how to assess independence between major digital assets and whether short-term outperformance is enough to support claims of lasting separation.

This meant that the asset had shed more than 50% of its value in just a month as it peaked at $2.40 on January 6. The question now is whether this is a full-on bear market, and if it is, how low can XRP go as the correction deepens? We asked ChatGPT, Perplexity, Grok, and Gemini about their view on the matter. How Low, XRP? ChatGPT admitted that plummeting from $2.40 to $1.10 in the span of just a month means it’s not just a “healthy correction” any longer – it’s a clear shift in market structure. The rejection at $2.40 marked a decisive local top, while the subsequent breakdown below $1.50 and $1.30 erased multiple layers of support. The current weak rebound suggests that buyers remain cautious and any upside attempts are likely to face heavy selling pressure, it added. If this bearish behavior continues in the following weeks or months, the AI solution from OpenAI noted that XRP could plunge to somewhere between $0.85-$0.95. Interestingly, Perplexity sort of agreed with that target: “This range represents a realistic bear-cycle low target if broader capitulation unfolds. A move here would align with historical behavior seen across larger-cap altcoins during prolonged downturns,” Perplexity added. Gemini outlined the significance of the psychological $1.00 support. If it falls, XRP’s situation could worsen exponentially as investors will likely flock once that floor gives in. Consequently, it warned that the asset’s crash might take it even further south, to a low of somewhere around $0.60. Interestingly, that would result in completing a full circle since the US presidential elections in 2024, as XRP started its ascent from those levels. Chances for a Rebound? All AIs noted that it’s difficult to be optimistic in the current market environment. However, Grok outlined a possible bounce-off scenario in case XRP has already bottomed at $1.10. The AI integrated into X said the cross-border token can remain sideways between $1.10 and $1.45 for the next few weeks and possibly look ahead for a more decisive rebound to over $1.60 if it manages to take down the $1.50 resistance. This would be the so-called ‘bull case’ in which XRP doesn’t break down beneath $1.00 soon. If it does, all bets are off, Grok added, and warned of further declines to under $0.90.

Key Takeaways: Bukele holds a 91.9% approval rating, driven mainly by improved security and falling crime. Bitcoin adoption among citizens remains limited despite its legal tender status. El Salvador continues accumulating Bitcoin even while negotiating with the IMF. A new survey published by Salvadoran newspaper La Prensa Gráfica found that 91.9% of respondents approve of Bukele’s performance in office. Of the 1,200 people polled, 62.8% said they strongly approve of the president, while only 1.8% expressed strong disapproval. Bukele reacted sarcastically to the figures on X, writing, “So now they’re 1.8%?” Crime Reduction Fuels Bukele Support Despite Bitcoin Experiment The results suggest that the administration’s popularity is being driven largely by domestic policy rather than cryptocurrency. According to the poll, improved security conditions ranked as the main reason for public support. Since taking office in 2019, Bukele has launched an aggressive crackdown on gangs and opened the Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT), a large-scale prison designed to hold suspected gang members. Homicide rates have fallen sharply compared with previous years, a change widely cited by residents as the government’s biggest achievement. ¿O sea que ahora son el 1.8%? pic.twitter.com/TG9Bi4jhJ1 — Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) February 5, 2026 By contrast, the president’s Bitcoin initiative appears to carry little weight in public opinion. Only 2.2% of respondents described Bitcoin as the biggest failure of Bukele’s six-year presidency, and the cryptocurrency was otherwise barely mentioned in the survey. The muted reaction reflects a broader pattern: while the country made history in 2021 by adopting Bitcoin as legal tender and requiring businesses to accept it where possible, everyday usage has remained limited. Bukele himself acknowledged the gap in a 2024 interview with TIME, saying the project did not achieve the widespread adoption authorities initially expected. The policy also drew criticism from international lenders, particularly the International Monetary Fund, which repeatedly warned about fiscal and financial stability risks. Despite those concerns, El Salvador has not stepped away from accumulating Bitcoin. Government officials say the country has continued buying one Bitcoin per day since 2022, a strategy Bukele has publicly pledged to maintain. Online trackers linked to the government’s Bitcoin office indicate the national reserves are still growing. San Salvador recently reached a financing agreement with the IMF that included scaling back certain crypto-related initiatives, but the administration has signaled that purchases for state reserves will continue. IMF Presses El Salvador as Chivo Wallet Sale Looms In December last year, the IMF said its ongoing talks with El Salvador over Bitcoin policy are focused on improving transparency, protecting public funds and reducing financial risks. As part of the discussions, authorities are negotiating the potential sale or shutdown of the government-run Chivo wallet, which has faced complaints about fraud, identity theft and technical problems since launch. Officials had previously signaled the app could be wound down while private crypto wallets continue operating in the country. El Salvador secured a $1.4 billion IMF loan in 2024 after tensions linked to its Bitcoin adoption. The IMF’s latest review noted stronger-than-expected economic performance, projecting real GDP growth of about 4% this year with positive prospects for the next.

The unmanned spaceplane is launched by a Long March-2F rocket that returns to Earth by landing on a runway. Both China and the U.S. are making advancements in space technology as they frequently launch unmanned, robotic spaceplanes on missions. China successfully launches fourth reusable spacecraft mission A Long March-2F carrier rocket lifted off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in the Gobi Desert of northwest China carrying a reusable experimental spacecraft into orbit for the fourth time since the program began in 2020. The state news agency Xinhua reported that the mission is intended to carry out “technological verification.” The spacecraft will test specific tools and systems that allow it to be used multiple times with the goal of providing technical support for what China calls the “peaceful use of outer space.” By using reusable technology, a country can significantly lower the cost of reaching orbit. China has not released official photos or technical specifications of the vehicle, but it is widely believed to be an unmanned spaceplane. The project has been nicknamed “Shenlong” by Chinese fans, which means “Divine Dragon.” China’s “Shenlong” first mission launched on September 4, 2020, and stayed in space for only two days before returning to a designated landing site. The second mission, launched in August 2022, stayed in orbit for 276 days before landing in May 2023. The third mission was in December 2023 and lasted for 268 days, returning in September 2024. During these missions, observers noticed the spacecraft releasing small objects into orbit, which experts believe were smaller satellites used to test maneuvers and communication. How does the “Divine Dragon” compare to the American X-37B? The “Shenlong” is often compared to the U.S. Space Force’s X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle as both are unmanned, robotic spaceplanes that launch vertically on a rocket but land horizontally on a runway like a traditional airplane. The U.S. recently concluded its seventh X-37B mission (OTV-7) in March 2025. The mission lasted 434 days and tested “aerobraking” maneuvers, which use the Earth’s atmosphere to change orbits without using much fuel. Just one day before China’s February 7 launch, the U.S. Space Force was scheduled to launch its eighth mission (OTV-8) using a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. The U.S. X-37B is roughly 9 meters long, while the Chinese “Shenlong” is estimated to be about 10 meters long. Both vehicles operate in “Low Earth Orbit,” but the U.S. version has demonstrated the ability to fly in much higher, elliptical orbits. Earlier this week, Chinese state media released a concept video for a project called “Luanniao,” a massive “space carrier” intended for the distant future. China also reported the first flight of a new electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft on February 6, 2026. It was developed by the Ninth Academy of the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, and can carry two passengers at 150 kilometers per hour. China’s next major lunar mission, Chang’e 7, is expected to launch later in 2026 to search for water ice at the lunar south pole. NASA’s Artemis II mission is also currently scheduled to send four astronauts on a loop around the Moon in early 2026.

Investors are increasingly looking for projects with value and solid technology, rather than short-term trends. As a result, attention is shifting toward protocols that aim to solve clear problems in decentralized finance. One new project is gaining steady momentum while many established coins remain flat. Its focus on practical use is drawing interest from analysts and long-term investors alike. For those searching for the next major crypto opportunity in finance, this shift toward utility-driven platforms is becoming hard to ignore. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Rise Mutuum Finance is building a decentralized lending and borrowing hub designed to give users full control over their assets without a middleman. Users can supply their crypto to earn yield or use it as collateral to access liquidity while keeping ownership of their holdings. Returns are shown through APY. For example, supplying $1,000 in assets at a 9% APY could earn about $90 over a year, depending on demand. Risk is managed with Loan-to-Value (LTV) limits. With a 70% LTV, depositing $5,000 in collateral would allow access to up to $3,500. This structure keeps the system balanced while remaining simple to use. The project has enjoyed unbelievable momentum since the commencement of Q1 2025. It already received more than $20.4 million funds through a global network of investors. The number of believers has reached over 19,000 people who believe in the future of this protocol. Such enormous expansion demonstrates that the market is prepared to have a professional and safe lending network. Security and Protocol Activation The most important milestone for the project was the recent launch of the V1 protocol on the Sepolia testnet. This release marks a working version of the platform where users can interact with core features in a live but risk-free environment. The V1 protocol includes interest-bearing liquidity pools, allowing users to supply assets into shared pools that are used for borrowing activity. In return, suppliers receive mtTokens, which act as on-chain receipts for their deposits. These mtTokens are designed to increase in value over time as fees are generated within the pools. This setup allows users to clearly track their position while testing how liquidity provision and yield mechanics function in real conditions. The technology being operational prior to the mainnet launch is one of the significant indicators of progress. The team completed an extensive security audit by Halborn in order to have the perfect code. This company is ranked among the most reputable companies in the globe in securing blockchain projects. An excellent audit is a sign that the protocol is safe with huge capital and long-term application. Value Expansion and Mechanics The protocol’s whitepaper highlights a buy-and-distribute mechanism. The fee on any loan is used to repurchase in the market MUTM tokens. The people who support the network are then provided with these tokens. This builds upon itself as the greater the usage the greater the demand on the token. In the future, the team plans a native stablecoin. This asset would be secured with the collateral within the system and will render the borrowing even more stable. Due to these good characteristics, analysts have a lot of optimism on the price. It has been theorized by many that MUTM may be valued at $0.35 or more by the end of the year 2026. This would be a 9x boost to the existing price as long as the protocol continues to attract additional users. Positioning and the Final Entry Window Mutuum Finance is going to establish itself as a leader in the new crypto wave of decentralized finance. Having access to lending instruments, as well as high-quality-security, it is prepared to compete with the largest players in the field. The project is in Phase 7 of distribution and the price of MUTM is currently at 0.04. This is a very critical point since the official launch value is fixed at $0.06. Individuals who are joining in this time are receiving a 50% MUTM discount. This is the final opportunity to obtain a position at this rate before the protocol is transferred to the mainnet. The rush to buy is also increasing among people who track the best crypto watchlists as the supply at this price is disappearing.

Speaking on CNB C Fr iday, Farley sai d to o many crypto firms are discovering a hard truth: what they built is a product, not a real business. Farley knows something about industry shakeups. During his time running the NYSE until 2018, he watched the exchange business go through massive consolidation. Now he thinks something is similar is going to happen. “The same thing is going to happen starting right now in crypto,” he told the network. Market downturn exposes weak business models The recent market downturn is exposing weak business models. Bitcoin has fallen roughly 45% from its peak of $126,100 in October and was trading at $69,405 when Farley gave his interview . He sai d th e price drop is washing away the “false optimism” that let weak companie s su rvive with inflated price tags. While people often panic during these corrections, Farley believe s th is is actually when the best long-term choices get made. The problem, according to Farley, is that this cleanup should have started much earlier. “It should have happened a year or two ago,” he explained. Companies kept hoping they could still fetch the kind of valuations seen in 2020, even when their numbers didn’t support it. He gave an example of firms bringing in just $10 million in revenue with no growth who still wanted $200 million to sell. “That dream is going to be over,” Farley said. “People are going to realize they don’t have businesses, they have products, and they need to merge up, and they need to scale, and that is going to happen. ” Institutional approach replaces speculative era According to Farley, the industry is moving away from “chasing frog coins and 100x leverage” and toward “on-chain” finance. The fundamental premise is that significant financial assets will eventually be transferred to public blockchains. Because they are looking five to ten years ahead and are not responding to daily movements, large institutional players continue to be engaged despite dramatic price changes. The process of consolidation will not be simple. Larger initiatives will acquire smaller ones, typically resulting in internal reorganizations and job losses. The businesses that come out of this phase, however, need to be more equipped to handle the high trading volumes that institutions demand and adhere to stringent regulatory requirements. Farley said that surviving companies need to stop being just “features” and become “institutional, compliant, and respected.” The difference between having a speculative product and running a sustainable business will determine who gets bought and who does the buying. There are sign s th e underlying technology has staying power. Even traditional firms like the NYSE have shown interest in putting stocks on blockchain systems, which Farley sees as proof that the technology works even if individual projects fail. This institutional endorsement suggests that while individual tokens may fluctuate, the infrastructure itself is becoming an undeniable fixture of modern global finance. The current market is acting like a filter . As investors become pickier about where they pu t mo ney, only companies that can prove they are built for the long haul will attract buyers or survive on their own. The result will likely be a crypto industry that looks more like traditional finance, with a handful of large, heavily regulated companies providing most of the infrastructure. For firms that can adapt and grow during this transition, the consolidation wave offers a chance to become legitimate long-term players in what Farley sees as an increasingly professional global market. The wild west days appear to be ending, replaced by a more mature phase where size, compliance, and institutional backing matter more than hype. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

This surge represents a critical psychological and technical threshold for the world’s premier cryptocurrency, reigniting discussions about its long-term trajectory and role in the global financial system. Consequently, analysts are scrutinizing the confluence of factors driving this rally, from institutional adoption to macroeconomic trends. Bitcoin Price Breaches a Critical Resistance Level According to data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, the BTC/USDT trading pair on Binance confirmed the breakthrough early Tuesday. This price action follows weeks of consolidation below the previous all-time high. The move above $70,000 is not merely a numerical milestone; it signifies a robust recovery of market confidence. Furthermore, this price level had previously acted as a formidable resistance point, making its breach a technically significant event. Trading volume spiked by approximately 35% during the ascent, indicating strong buyer participation. Market structure analysis reveals key support and resistance zones. The table below outlines recent critical levels: Price Level Significance $73,800 Previous All-Time High (Nov 2024) $70,000 Current Breakout & Psychological Barrier $65,200 Recent Strong Support Zone $60,000 Major Institutional Buy Zone (Q4 2024) Several immediate catalysts contributed to this upward movement. Firstly, renewed filings for spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) by major asset managers have bolstered institutional sentiment. Secondly, on-chain data shows a decrease in exchange reserves, suggesting a trend toward accumulation rather than selling. Finally, broader macroeconomic conditions, including currency devaluation concerns in several emerging markets, have increased demand for perceived stores of value. Analyzing the Drivers Behind the Cryptocurrency Rally The rally extends beyond simple speculation. A deeper examination reveals foundational shifts in the digital asset landscape. Institutional capital flows have become a dominant narrative. Since the regulatory approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in key jurisdictions, weekly inflows have consistently exceeded $1.5 billion. This institutional embrace provides a more stable demand base compared to previous retail-driven cycles. Moreover, the integration of blockchain technology by traditional finance (TradFi) firms for settlement and custody has legitimized the asset class. Network fundamentals also support the price appreciation. The Bitcoin hash rate, a measure of computational power securing the network, continues to hit record highs. This indicates massive infrastructure investment and reinforces network security. Simultaneously, the adoption of layer-2 solutions like the Lightning Network has facilitated faster and cheaper transactions, enhancing Bitcoin’s utility for everyday payments. These technological advancements address previous criticisms about scalability and efficiency. Expert Perspectives on Sustainable Growth Financial analysts and blockchain researchers point to a maturation in market dynamics. “The breach of $70,000 is significant, but the underlying story is about diversification,” notes a report from the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance. They observe that Bitcoin’s correlation with traditional risk assets like tech stocks has decreased over the past quarter. This decoupling suggests investors are beginning to treat Bitcoin as a distinct asset class with unique value propositions, such as censorship resistance and a verifiably scarce supply. Regulatory clarity in major economies has also played a pivotal role. Clearer frameworks for cryptocurrency custody, taxation, and trading have reduced uncertainty for large-scale investors. For instance, the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, now fully implemented, provides a comprehensive rulebook for service providers. This regulatory progress reduces systemic risk and fosters a more professional market environment. Consequently, corporate treasury allocations to Bitcoin have seen a measurable uptick, as evidenced by public filings from several NASDAQ-listed companies. The Historical Context and Future Market Trajectory To understand the present, one must consider Bitcoin’s past cycles. Each major bull market has been characterized by a new wave of adoption. The 2017 cycle was driven by retail speculation and Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). The 2021 cycle saw the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The current cycle appears heavily influenced by institutional portfolio allocation and the global macroeconomic climate. Inflation hedging remains a primary use case cited by long-term holders, especially in regions with volatile national currencies. Looking forward, several factors will influence whether this price level sustains. Key considerations include: Macroeconomic Policy: Central bank interest rate decisions and quantitative tightening measures. Regulatory Developments: Ongoing legislative efforts in the United States and Asia-Pacific regions. Technological Innovation: Progress on upgrades like Taproot and further Lightning Network adoption. Market Liquidity: Depth of order books and the health of major trading venues. Potential headwinds exist, of course. Regulatory crackdowns in specific jurisdictions could create short-term volatility. Additionally, the energy debate surrounding Bitcoin mining continues, though the network’s shift toward renewable energy sources—now estimated above 60%—is mitigating environmental concerns. Market participants also monitor the actions of long-term holders; a significant increase in spending by these entities could signal a local market top. Conclusion Bitcoin’s ascent above $70,000 marks a definitive chapter in its evolution from a niche digital experiment to a mainstream financial asset. This Bitcoin price milestone reflects a complex interplay of institutional adoption, technological resilience, and shifting global macroeconomic sentiment. While volatility remains an inherent feature, the market structure demonstrates increasing maturity and depth. The breakthrough serves as a powerful testament to the growing integration of cryptocurrency within the broader economic framework, setting the stage for the next phase of digital finance. FAQs Q1: What does Bitcoin trading above $70,000 mean for the average investor? It primarily signals strong market confidence and could attract more institutional investment, potentially increasing mainstream acceptance and stability over the long term. However, it does not guarantee short-term gains and underscores the importance of understanding the asset’s volatility. Q2: How does the current rally compare to Bitcoin’s previous all-time high in 2024? The current rally appears to be supported by stronger fundamentals, including sustained institutional ETF inflows and clearer regulations. Trading volume and network security metrics are significantly higher now, suggesting a more robust foundation than during previous peaks. Q3: What are the main risks associated with Bitcoin at this price level? Key risks include increased regulatory scrutiny in certain countries, potential macroeconomic shifts that affect all risk assets, technological vulnerabilities (though rare), and the possibility of a major sell-off by long-term holders taking profits. Q4: Does this price increase affect Bitcoin’s utility for transactions? Not directly. The Bitcoin network’s transaction capacity and cost are governed by block space demand and layer-2 solutions like the Lightning Network, not the USD price of one bitcoin. High value per coin can actually incentivize better network security. Q5: Where can investors find reliable, real-time data on Bitcoin’s price and network health? Reputable sources include aggregated data from multiple exchanges on sites like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko, on-chain analytics from Glassnode or CryptoQuant, and official metrics from the Bitcoin network itself, such as blockchain explorers.

According to reports from the Indian police, the victim fell prey to an online scam that promised investors high rewards and incentives on cryptocurrency investments. According to the complainant, the crypto scammers carried out a series of debits from his savings and UPI-linked account. The said unsanctioned transactions occurred between January 11 and 17, 2026, and included Rs. 7.5 lakh withdrawn on January 13, Rs. 5 lakh and Rs. 2.74 lakh withdrawn on January 17. The Indian air force veteran also mentioned that other small-scale transactions occurred on his account, noting a debit of Rs. 95,2000, Rs. 50,000, and Rs. 65,000. How did the crypto scammers steal from the Indian air force veteran? In a detailed explanation to the police , the Indian native stated in his complaint that he was approached by the scammers through WhatsApp. Like most victims, he was contacted by an unfamiliar number on WhatsApp, where they talked about several aspects. This is likely the first step that these criminals undertake, trying to make the victim as comfortable with them as possible before they begin interaction that would lead towards the scam they are trying to pull. After small conversations, the victim claimed that the person introduced him to another man on Telegram, who introduced himself as Harwinder Sandhu. It was this man who talked to him about the crypto investments, giving him several upsides of the investment scheme. He claimed the man would register and invest in a cryptocurrency bonus plan where he would be able to recoup about 50% bonus on investments made in different digital assets on the platform. In order to gain credibility, Sandhu showed him several screenshots of returns and testimonies of past and current investors benefiting from the scheme. Once he agreed to the investment, the criminals quickly put him through and showed him how to register. After registering, he was asked to make several investments to kickstart things. However, the scammers allegedly froze his wallet after his investments and total bonus showed Rs. 2,225,450 on the application. Crypto scams continue to cause harm across India The police mentioned that this is the way these criminals usually carry out their operations. They claimed that the fraudsters would take a friendly approach, talking to their victim like a new friend before attacking. In other cases, they use pictures of beautiful women and lie to their victims about romantic feelings towards them, accelerating the con. The police claimed the Indian Air Force veteran was asked to send an additional Rs. 774,550 as a release charge, which was when he discovered that it was a scam. Over the last few months, the police have warned residents across India to be careful when dealing with strangers on the internet. While the law enforcement agency concedes that social media is a place to meet new friends, they have urged people to be watchful about the things that these new friends try to introduce to them. In some cases, they have also advised that residents seek the advice of professional finance experts if they are willing to enter into an investment scheme. In another incident, the police claimed that a 66-year-old businessman from Pune was scammed of about Rs. 21.6 lakh after a friend lured him into investing in cryptocurrency trading. The victim was contacted by a woman who claimed to be interested in his work. After several messages between them, the duo agreed to meet in March this year. With their agreement to meet locked, the woman introduced the victim to the fake investment under the guise of big returns. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

According to Pumpius, the proposal offered 25,000 USDT in exchange for publishing a post containing specific claims criticizing Ripple, XRP, and certain influencers. In the message shared by Pumpius, the sender allegedly outlined several required talking points. These included tagging Ripple in a post, describing the project as a scam, claiming the commentator had sold all XRP holdings, and blaming Ripple and influencers for what was described as “wealth destruction.” The message also stated that the post could be written “in your own words” as long as those points were included.

He wrote that he had “just received a private message offering me $25,000 to defame Ripple and XRP,” adding that the instructions appeared to be part of a coordinated messaging effort. Pumpius encouraged readers to consider who might be funding such campaigns and who might benefit from negative narratives about XRP. He suggested that some social media criticism directed at Ripple may not be organic, but instead part of paid promotional activity designed to influence public perception. He also stated that financial incentives can be used to shape online narratives and claimed the existence of organized attempts to influence conversations in the digital asset space. Pumpius concluded his post by emphasizing that he would not accept payment to publish such claims and that he intended to expose similar offers if they appear. Dominic Kwok Responds to the Claim Dominic Kwok, co-founder of EasyA, replied publicly to Pumpius’ post, saying he had received reports of similar proposals. Kwok wrote that “many people have dm’d me with similar offers, in many cases even more money.” He added that he believes there is “a serious, concerted effort by the anti-XRP lobby to discredit XRP.” Kwok’s response supported Pumpius’ claim that coordinated campaigns may exist within online crypto communities.

The price of Worldcoin is expected to reach a maximum level of $6.40 in 2032. Worldcoin (WLD) is garnering significant attention from both investors and enthusiasts, which may indicate its future performance and current price, a trend that aligns with broader market predictions. In early May, WLD experienced a notable surge, quickly positioning itself among the top-performing altcoins. This rise coincided with a spike in activity surrounding advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly those related to OpenAI. The increased interest in Worldcoin is likely fueled by speculation surrounding potential collaborations and future projects that could integrate AI technology into the cryptocurrency space, further driving its market momentum. Overview Cryptocurrency Worldcoin Token WLD Price $0.3790 Market Cap $1.14B Trading Volume (24-hour) $99.61M Circulating Supply 2.78B WLD All-time High $11.82 Mar 09, 2024 All-time Low $0.3646 Oct 11, 2025 24-hour High $0.4023 24-hour Low $0.3899 Worldcoin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Prediction $ 0.3030 (-24.82%) Price Volatility 12.53% 50-Day SMA $ 0.5224 14-Day RSI 41.12 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 17(extreme fear) Green Days 10/30 (33%) Worldcoin price analysis: WLD of value stalls below $0.4023 Price stays capped at $0.4023 and protected at $0.3899, keeping it hovering near $0.3970. Repeated failures near $0.4023 show sellers still cap rallies and limit upside follow-through. $0.3899 Support level continues to attract buyers, but a sustained break would shift bias toward further downside. On February 8, 2026, Worldcoin (WLD) trades at $0.3970, showing a 0.79% downtrend over the last 24 hours. The session stays defined by a tight band, with resistance at $0.4023 and support at $0.3899, as price action continues to compress around the mid-range. Worldcoin 1-day price chart: WLD of value holds range between $0.3899 and $0.4023 On the 1-day chart, WLD stays range-bound and trades near $0.3970, which sits close to the midpoint between $0.3899 support and $0.4023 resistance. Momentum remains soft because rebounds keep weakening as price approaches $0.4023, where supply appears quickly and prevents acceptance above that ceiling. WLD/USDT Chart: TradingView The setup reads as consolidation after intraday volatility, with the clearest signals coming from reactions at the range edges. A firm daily reclaim of $0.4023 is needed to shift control back to buyers, while a sustained break below $0.3899 would invalidate the range and raise downside risk, keeping mean-reversion trading dominant in the meantime. Worldcoin 4-hour price chart: WLD short-term swings fade as resistance holds at $0.4023 On the 4-hour chart, WLD keeps rotating quickly, with rallies fading as price approaches $0.4023 and sellers pushing it back toward $0.3970. The repeated rejections near resistance show that upside follow-through remains weak. WLD/USDT Chart: TradingView Support at $0.3899 continues to absorb sell pressure, as dips toward that zone draw buyers and stabilize pullbacks. However, rebounds stay limited while price keeps circling $0.3970, which reflects indecision rather than a sustained directional move. Worldcoin technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 0.4863 SELL SMA 5 $ 0.4574 SELL SMA 10 $ 0.4474 SELL SMA 21 $ 0.4864 SELL SMA 50 $ 0.5224 SELL SMA 100 $ 0.6197 SELL SMA 200 $ 0.8674 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 0.5063 BUY EMA 5 $ 0.5304 SELL EMA 10 $ 0.5422 SELL EMA 21 $ 0.5435 SELL EMA 50 $ 0.5939 SELL EMA 100 $ 0.7113 SELL EMA 200 $ 0.8853 SELL What can you expect from the Worldcoin price next? WLD’s next move depends on reactions at $0.4023 resistance and $0.3899 support. For now, price is likely to keep ranging near $0.3970. A hold above $0.4023 would support a bullish shift, while a sustained break below $0.3899 would tilt the bias toward further downside. Is Worldcoin a good investment? Whether WLD is a good investment depends on your goals and risk tolerance. Right now, the chart shows WLD range-bound between $0.4023 resistance and $0.3899 support, which signals an undecided market. A move and hold above $0.4023 improves the bullish case, while a sustained break below $0.3899 increases downside risk, so it helps to weigh these levels alongside fundamentals like adoption, supply dynamics, and broader market conditions. Why is the WLD Price Down today WLD is down today because sellers keep rejecting prices near $0.4023 resistance, which weakens rebounds and pulls WLD back toward $0.3970. With momentum soft, even modest selling pressure can keep price drifting lower while $0.3899 support continues to act as the main buyer-defense zone. Recent news Worldcoin is now active in over 100 countries with around 25 million users, including 12 million verified via Orbs. Developers are earning about $300K per month in WLD to create human-only apps, and rumors suggest major social platforms might adopt Orb-style ID soon. Will Worldcoin reach $5? Yes, according to the long-term predictions, Worldcoin is projected to reach up to $5 by 2032. Will Worldcoin reach $100? Worldcoin’s prediction shows that $100 is highly unlikely due to current market conditions, its present price levels, and the significant rise in market capitalization required, impacting worldcoin price movements. Such an increase would necessitate extraordinary growth and adoption. Does Worldcoin have a promising long-term future? The WLD coin is exhibiting a recovery trend; therefore, many may consider investing in the token, as it may have a promising long-term future and could be viewed as a good investment, despite the potential short-term risks. Continued development, adoption, and favorable market trends will be crucial for its success. Worldcoin price prediction February 2026 Worldcoin is expected to exhibit a range of price movements in February 2026. The potential low is $0.398, while the average price might be around $0.4255. On the higher end, WLD could reach up to $0.4377.

However, company executives say its balance sheet strength creates rare strategic flexibility. Despite steep losses on paper, Forward maintains the largest publicly traded Solana treasury and holds no corporate debt, a position its leadership views as an advantage rather than a liability. Forward currently holds nearly seven million SOL tokens, accumulated at an average price near $232. With Solana trading around $85, the company faces an unrealized loss approaching $1 billion. Consequently, FWDI shares have dropped sharply, sliding from nearly $40 last year to about $5 today. The drawdown reflects broader skepticism toward crypto-heavy balance sheets during prolonged market weakness. Balance Sheet Strength Shapes Strategy However, Forward’s chief investment officer Ryan Navi argues the firm’s lack of leverage sets it apart from peers. While several crypto treasury companies have sold assets to manage debt obligations, Forward avoided borrowing entirely. Hence, it now retains flexibility while competitors retrench. Navi says scale and discipline allow Forward to act when others cannot. Additionally, the firm can selectively deploy leverage later if market conditions improve. That optionality matters as valuations compress across the sector. Forward’s transformation began in 2025 following a $1.65 billion private investment in public equity. Backed by Galaxy Digital, Jump Crypto, and Multicoin Capital, the raise repositioned the firm around Solana accumulation. The company now holds more SOL than its next three public rivals combined. Solana as a Long-Term Bet Significantly, Forward’s strategy hinges on Solana’s technical profile rather than short-term price action. Navi believes fast settlement, low fees, and network scalability position Solana for consumer and capital markets growth. Moreover, previous spikes in network activity demonstrated its ability to handle massive user demand. Forward stakes its SOL holdings, earning yields between 6% and 7%. Although issuance declines will reduce returns over time, staking still offsets holding costs. Additionally, Forward partnered with Sanctum to issue a liquid staking token, fwdSOL. That structure enables capital efficiency while maintaining onchain yield. Using fwdSOL as collateral, Forward can borrow at rates below staking returns on decentralized platforms. Consequently, the firm achieves a lower effective cost of capital than many competitors. Consolidation and Long-Term Vision Navi describes Forward as a permanent-capital vehicle rather than a trading operation. The firm plans to expand into tokenized real-world assets and recurring revenue opportunities that exceed its capital costs. Moreover, leadership views current sector stress as a setup for consolidation. With no debt, large-scale SOL exposure, and backing from major crypto investors, Forward believes it can acquire distressed rivals. Kyle Samani’s decision to accept FWDI equity instead of cash further signals confidence in that long-term vision.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|SOL|TRADING|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-02-08 09:11:24

Google Trends shows “Crypto capitulation” searches rocketed from 11 to 58 in just a week. The widely-watched Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which measures market sentiment on a scale from 0 (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme greed), has slumped into “extreme fear” territory, with readings as low as 7 –11/100 in the past week. Bitcoin has erased much of its recent gains after plummeting to around $60,000 — its lowest level since late 2024 , including those accumulated since the 2024 U.S. election cycle. More retail investors are also monitoring the crypto market for bottoming signals to time their next purchases, according to Crypto research platform Santiment. In its Saturday report, it detailed: “Retail traders are trying to meta-analyze the market, looking for signs of others quitting to time their own entries, which often happens near bottoms.” The platform noted that these investors’ actions are tied to “capitulation,” becoming a hot topic on social media. However, Santiment points out that most market observers hoping for capitulation signals might not see it, and that the market bottom may have already passed. Crypto analyst Franzen says capitulation was the topic of the week According to the crypto analytics platform CryptoQuant, Bitcoin is trading at just half its all-time high. It even warned of 70–80% drawdowns for Bitcoin, but the more concerning risk is investors’ cashing out their positions rather than price declines, noting “It’s not just how low it goes, but how long it stays there.” Since early this month, searches for crypto capitulation on Google have increased by 427%, as investors try to sell their assets. Caleb Franzen, a market analyst, also noted on X that “Capitulation” was the top topic in this week’s discussions. However, he asserted that bear markets often experience multiple capitulations before the real bottom emerges. He also shared a chart of capitulation events in 2022, though some X commenters disagreed with his data, noting that some of them were just price dips. Historically, traders have avoided calling a bottom too early, as past cycles show that prices can keep falling after optimism returns. Though at the moment, crypto sentiment is also down to 7, reading extreme fear. Santiment data also shows that the ratio of positive to negative comments has fallen sharply, with negative commentary at its highest level since December 1. Santiment hints that the current BTC market price could be a real bottom In its report, Santiment also stated that Bitcoin on-chain metrics are now showing a rare “blood in the streets” buy signal, especially since the cryptocurrency plunged to $60,000 and has only partially recovered. It also suggested that with over $15B in leverage lost, funding rates turning negative, MVRV showing holder profits at a 3-year low, this could be a real bottom for the asset and not just a dead cat bounce. Nonetheless, the platform’s team noted that they are observing the market’s ability to sustain key support levels to assess if it remains a favorable buying zone. Meanwhile, BTC’s decline has put Michael Saylor and Strategy in investors’ focus, but their commitment to their crypto strategy remains firm. The top asset still has high social media dominance. However, Ethereum continues to see low social dominance even as its price slips below $2,000, with Bitcoin drawing most of the attention. Such periods of social media neglect often point to a buying opportunity. Aside from capitulation, Santiment showed discussions around liquidations and political news involving Trump and Kevin Warsh are surging. Normally, when liquidation terms trend and actual liquidations increase, it indicates a bottom as over-leveraged traders are flushed out. Bitcoin’s open interest has recently shed over $15 billion, marking a big reset in leverage. Get seen where it counts.

Most larger-cap altcoins are also in the green, with ETH trading above $2,100 and SOL close to $90. HYPE is among the few alts deep in the red today. BTC Taps $70K The previous weekend brought unexpected volatility to the cryptocurrency markets. The largest of the bunch dumped from $84,000 to under $76,000 on Saturday night and tried to recover to $79,000 on Sunday. However, it was stopped there, and the bears resumed control during almost the entire business week. After initiating several smaller and less painful leg downs, they stepped up on the gas pedal on Thursday, causing another market calamity. In just over 24 hours, they brought BTC to its knees, pushing it from $77,000 to $60,000 on Friday morning, its lowest price in well over a year. The cryptocurrency rebounded sharply after this massive decline, and bounced to $72,000 on Friday evening and Saturday morning. It couldn’t proceed further and was pushed down to $68,000 yesterday. Now, though, it has jumped to just over $70,000 after a 2.3% daily increase. Its market cap has reclaimed the $1.4 trillion mark, while its dominance over the alts is just shy of 57% on CG.

However, it has recovered almost $400 since then and now sits above $2,100. BNB and XRP continue to fight for the fourth spot in terms of market cap, but Binance Coin has emerged as the winner during the weekend. Solana’s SOL is up to almost $90, while LTC, LINK, ZEC, and XLM have posted gains of up to 4%. In contrast, HYPE has dropped by almost 5% to under $32.

Key Takeaways: Giannis Antetokounmpo became the first active NBA player to invest directly in prediction market platform Kalshi. Kalshi offers federally regulated “yes-or-no” event contracts across sports, politics and entertainment. The deal follows growing scrutiny over the blurred line between trading markets and sports betting. The two-time NBA MVP announced the partnership Friday, saying he will join Kalshi as a shareholder and collaborate with the company on live events and marketing campaigns. Kalshi confirmed the agreement in a statement , adding that Antetokounmpo will not be allowed to trade on any NBA-related markets due to internal rules prohibiting insider trading and manipulation. Inside Kalshi’s ‘Yes-or-No’ Prediction Trading Markets Kalshi operates a marketplace where users trade “yes or no” contracts tied to real-world outcomes. The platform lists markets spanning politics, entertainment and sports, allowing traders to take positions on events such as award winners or championship results. Earlier this week, the service even hosted a market on whether Antetokounmpo himself would be traded before the NBA deadline. Although money changes hands, the platform is treated as a financial exchange rather than a sportsbook. As a result, Kalshi is permitted to operate across the United States under federal oversight, avoiding the patchwork of state gambling regulations that apply to traditional betting operators. The NBA’s collective bargaining agreement allows players to promote betting companies under certain conditions, provided they do not advertise wagers on NBA, WNBA or G League games. Players may also hold passive equity stakes of up to 1% in such businesses. Antetokounmpo’s investment falls within those limits. “I like to win. It’s clear to me Kalshi is going to be a winner and I’m excited to be getting involved,” Antetokounmpo said. We all on @Kalshi now pic.twitter.com/cCNGxfLWO8 — Giannis Antetokounmpo (@Giannis_An34) February 6, 2026 He is not the first basketball figure linked to the company. Phoenix Suns star Kevin Durant is reportedly an indirect investor through the 35V venture fund he co-founded with agent Rich Kleiman. The move comes amid heightened scrutiny of sports wagering. US authorities recently filed gambling-related charges involving several basketball figures, and regulators have been examining the expanding overlap between trading platforms and betting markets. The NCAA previously asked Kalshi to modify wording on its site that suggested an official relationship with the organization. Kalshi Expands Sports Push With NHL Deal and Athlete Endorsement Despite the attention, Kalshi has been expanding its sports presence. The company announced a partnership with the NHL in October and, in January, signed professional golfer Bryson DeChambeau as its first athlete endorser, including appearances and promotional campaigns tied to events in which he competes. Kalshi has also secured a major media breakthrough after signing a partnership with CNN, making the company the network’s official prediction markets partner while closing a $1 billion funding round at an $11 billion valuation. Web3 prediction markets have crossed $13 billion in cumulative trading volume, marking a record high even as broader crypto markets cool. The surge has drawn in major players across tech and finance, including Fanatics, Coinbase, and MetaMask, all of which have recently launched or expanded event-trading platforms.

According to the report, the man was accused of committing sexual depravity against his daughter in exchange for digital assets on a livestream. According to Spanish police, the man, who was arrested in Madrid, would usually select depraved individuals like himself from his group of followers to watch him abuse the girl after posting sick photos of himself lying alongside the girl on a bed in a compromising position. The police released footage of the 46-year-old Spanish native being led out of his apartment, where he lived and committed the atrocities, into the waiting police car in handcuffs. Spanish man docked in ‘sex crimes for crypto’ operation According to the Spanish police , the arrest is the culmination of an investigation that has spanned four months. “Officers in Madrid have arrested a man for allegedly broadcasting the sexual abuse he subjected his own daughter to through a live streaming app,” a spokesperson for the National Police said. The Spanish police mentioned that in exchange for his actions, the man received digital assets via the same application where he carried out his atrocities. In addition, the police mentioned that he always exchanged the digital assets for an increase in online presence, which translated to an increase in popularity on the application. The police also claimed that some of his depraved followers used to shower him with gifts, with some sending the gifts during his distasteful activities, while others sent them as a reward before the end of his livestream. The police were informed about the atrocities some months ago through an anonymous email. The Spanish police claimed that they started investigations immediately they discovered what the man was doing on the livestream. They claimed that the anonymous email came in from a system that was designed to receive tip-offs from the public about child porn crimes. The police release stated that the probe began in November 2025, after they discovered that the arrested man used private livestreaming rooms to attract users interested in his kind of materials, using the photos as bait to lure them. Police say he exchanges his crypto payments for gifts and popularity “After contacting with paying customers through an external messaging app he broadcast the sexual abuse he subjected his underage daughter to in exchange for cryptocurrency , which could be exchanged online for gifts or to improve his web positioning. He was arrested after officers managed to identify him and locate him in Madrid. During a search of his home, two mobile phones with a large amount of pornographic material on them were seized,” the police spokesperson added. The police highlighted that he has been remanded in prison after appearing in front of a judge on suspicion of corruption of minors, consisting of the production, possession, and distribution of child pornography and a crime of sexual assault. According to local reports, the man was arrested in a neighborhood in Madrid called Tetuan, and police mentioned that they had never come across the application he was using to allegedly commit his depraved crimes before investigations started. This development comes at a time when the global populace has been apprehensive about the menace of artificial intelligence chatbots being used to create controversial deepfakes of women and children in compromising positions. It also comes at a time when regulators are being urged to enforce stricter penalties on individuals taking advantage of the pseudonymous nature of digital assets to carry out illegal activities. Regulators across the world are being charged to stand against this menace before it gets out of hand.

According to the financial educator, critics are overly focused on acquisition dates rather than long-term asset value, which he has long advocated for over traditional assets, he said in an X post on February 8. The controversy centers on criticism of Kiyosaki’s February 6 claim that he stopped buying Bitcoin at $6,000, a price level last seen several years ago, prompting accusations of inconsistency in his public statements. He responded by saying the figure referred to a price threshold, not a purchase date, and questioned why critics were focused on timing rather than results. “To the person who said I was lying that I bought Bitcoin at $6000…. I know my strike price not the date he falsely accuses me of the date I bought Bitcoin on. Why would he care what date I bought it on? Does he have a personal agenda for calling me a liar?” Kiyosaki posed. The backlash intensified because the claim appeared to conflict with his earlier comments. In January 2026, Kiyosaki urged investors to keep buying Bitcoin, gold , silver , and Ethereum despite price swings, when Bitcoin was near $90,000. Kiyosaki’s push to buy more Bitcoin That stance was consistent with multiple statements in 2025 suggesting he was still accumulating Bitcoin at much higher levels, including above $100,000, according to past reports and social media posts. These inconsistencies drew criticism from X users and community notes on his posts, with critics arguing that Kiyosaki was either misleading about having stopped buying Bitcoin years ago or exaggerating ongoing purchases while promoting it as an inflation and fiat-hedge asset. In response, Kiyosaki said acquisition dates are largely irrelevant, stressing that his focus is on the amount and quality of assets accumulated. He said he would buy more Bitcoin if it returned to $6,000, regardless of timing, and added that he is preparing to increase his exposure to gold. To the person who said I was lying about the date I bought Bitcoin for $600. To keep his small brain happy….I Will buy 60 – 2026 silver eagles and 20 mixed date eagles. I don’t know today’s date. It doesn’t matter. I suspect 2026 US silver eagles may become collector coins… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) February 7, 2026 In this line, the investor framed the dispute as a difference in investment philosophy, arguing that long-term wealth is built through asset accumulation across Bitcoin, precious metals, real estate, and energy investments rather than debates over purchase dates. Kiyosaki’s advocacy for alternative assets Overall, the investor remains an advocate of Bitcoin, gold, and silver as “real money” hedges against fiat currency risk and economic instability. Despite recent pullbacks, he views the declines as buying opportunities. Notably, Kiyosaki maintains aggressive 2026 price targets, forecasting Bitcoin at $250,000, gold at $27,000 per ounce, and silver at $200 per ounce, citing U.S. debt expansion, currency debasement, and a major wealth shift toward hard assets. Critics, however, point to his history of repeated crash warnings that failed to materialize, including predictions of a historic market collapse in 2025 and earlier calls in 2021 that did not come to pass as forecast.

Market slowdowns often create space for alternative platforms to gain visibility, especially those still in early development stages with structured growth plans. One project steadily attracting attention in this environment is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a presale-stage DeFi protocol designed around lending, borrowing, and long-term ecosystem utility. Why Early Positioning Matters During Market Pullbacks Currently valued at $0.04, the MUTM token is moving through Phase 7 of its presale after rising 300% from its starting price of $0.01. With a fixed supply of 4 billion tokens and 45.5% (1.82 billion tokens) allocated to presale, the structure is intentionally built for gradual appreciation rather than sudden inflation. Because pricing increases by nearly 20% at each new presale phase, later buyers will enter at progressively higher levels. This phased structure is one reason MUTM is being discussed by some market watchers as a next big crypto contender during broader market uncertainty. When Bitcoin (BTC) slows, investors often look for assets that have not yet reached open-market trading, where price discovery has already pushed valuations higher. MUTM remains at a discounted presale level, and the difference between entering now versus later phases could be meaningful. For example, if an investor buys $1,000 worth of MUTM at $0.04, they receive 25,000 tokens. If the price rises by 20% in the next phase to $0.045, the same $1,000 would only buy about 21K tokens. That gap widens further in later stages. This tiered model naturally rewards earlier participation without relying on hype cycles. Adding to accessibility, users can now purchase MUTM directly with a card, and there are no purchase limits, making entry simpler for a wider audience. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not positioned as a meme-driven token. Instead, it is building a decentralized lending and borrowing system designed to generate ongoing activity. The platform will operate through two separate models that serve different asset types and risk levels. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s P2C and P2P Models In the Peer-to-Contract model, users will deposit assets such as USDT and BTC into audited smart contracts. These pooled funds will provide liquidity to borrowers who will deposit more collateral than they borrow. Interest rates will adjust automatically depending on how much of each pool is being used. If borrowing demand rises, rates will increase to encourage more deposits and keep the system balanced. Depositors in this model will receive mtTokens at a 1:1 ratio representing their share of the pool. These tokens will grow in value as interest accumulates and can also be used as collateral. For instance, a user depositing $15,000 in USDT would receive 15,000 mtUSDT. If the pool’s average yield reaches around 15% APY depending on utilization, that could generate about $2,250 in passive earnings over a year, while the original funds remain accessible when liquidity is available. Borrowers will benefit by unlocking liquidity without selling their assets. Someone holding $1,000 worth of ETH could use it as collateral and borrow a smaller portion in stablecoins, depending on ETH’s loan-to-value ratio. This allows the user to keep exposure to ETH’s potential price growth while still gaining spending power. For higher-risk or less liquid assets, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will introduce a Peer-to-Peer model. Tokens like DOGE or SHIB will be isolated from the main liquidity pools. In this setup, lenders and borrowers will negotiate rates and loan durations directly. While lenders take on more risk, they may also access higher returns. Separating these assets helps protect the stability of the core protocol while expanding earning opportunities. The contracts are not vulnerable to attacks rather the security has been another focus. The protocol’s smart contracts underwent an audit by Halborn . Full remediation adds credibility as the project prepares for wider deployment. Growing Ecosystem Activity Before Mainnet Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already launched Version 1 of its protocol on the Sepolia testnet. This early release allows users to interact with multi-asset liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and automated liquidation protection in a live testing environment. Supported assets currently include ETH, USDT, LINK, and WBTC. A participant could deposit say ETH into a pool and receive mtETH that grows in value as interest builds. Another user holding LINK long term could use it as collateral to borrow in stablecoins instead of selling their tokens. These interactions help demonstrate how the system will function when it moves toward mainnet. Recently, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has surpassed 9,000 followers on X and is running a $100K giveaway where ten users each receive $10,000 in MUTM tokens. As a part of the reward system, there is also a 24-hour leaderboard that gives $500 in MUTM daily to the most active participant completing at least one transaction. These initiatives encourage consistent platform interaction rather than one-time speculation. Finally, Bitcoin (BTC) pullbacks often shift attention toward emerging ecosystems still building before full market exposure. With a rising presale price structure, active testnet usage, and a lending model designed for continuous participation, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is aligning itself with that window of opportunity. For investors watching market cycles closely, MUTM represents an early-phase project aiming to grow through real platform activity rather than short-term hype.

According to reports from several local outlets in the country, the Qatari Ministry of Commerce and Industry (MoCI) is teaming up with Microsoft to launch the ‘AI Agent Factory.’ The ‘AI Agent Factory’ is a digital platform that will leverage artificial intelligence across government services in a bid to modernize bureaucracy and boost efficiency. Announced on Friday, the initiative marks one of the most ambitious steps taken by Qatar in using the power of AI to transform how citizens and businesses interact with public institutions in the future. Qatar teams up with Microsoft to launch its AI Agent Factory The platform is also expected to help the ministry develop and deploy intelligent AI agents , an automated system capable of handling tasks ranging from processing applications to answering queries, without the lengthy development cycles traditionally associated with government IT projects. The factory will be built on Microsoft’s technology infrastructure and will be designed to integrate easily with existing government systems. In addition, Qatar is expected to roll out the new AI-powered services across the different departments in its public ministries. Ahmed Al-Kuwari, the director of the ministry’s Information Systems Department, hailed the launch as an important step towards comprehensive automation of government operations. “Leveraging advanced AI technologies will enhance operational efficiency, support decision-making, expand the scope of smart services, and improve their overall quality,” he said. The AI Agent Factory is just one of the latest in a series of government initiatives undertaken to embed artificial intelligence across various public sectors of Qatar. In the past few months, various ministries have developed automated document processing systems and predictive analytics tools designed to help them anticipate the needs of residents before they arise. The government has also established dedicated AI government frameworks to upskill civil services in working alongside intelligence systems. The Ministry of Transport and Communications has been plotting AI traffic management systems, while the Ministry of Public Health has deployed machine learning algorithms to streamline appointment scheduling and reduce waiting times at healthcare facilities. The platform provides more than just a technical upgrade. It enables faster deployment of AI solutions, and officials hope to be able to create a unified experience across different public sectors, removing fragmented service deliveries among organizations. Microsoft executive hails the partnership Ahmed Dandashi, general manager of Microsoft Qatar, said the partnership would accelerate digital transformation and deliver sustainable impact for institutions, the business sector, and society. The ministry added that once the technical and regulatory frameworks are finalized, it will work with Microsoft to improve the platform’s capabilities and introduce additional AI-powered services that align with its Qatar National Vision 2030. The move comes as Gulf nations race to position themselves as regional leader in AI adoption. While the United States and China have been going neck and neck in the global AI race, countries like the UAE and Saudi Arabia have also been investing heavily in artificial intelligence infrastructure and governance frameworks. The move also comes as the Qatar Central Bank (QCB) announced the launch of the AI-powered virtual assistant service on its website. The move was in line with the Third Financial Strategy, which supports the Qatar National Vision 2030. According to the bank, the move is also part of its commitment to deliver a seamless digital financial experience to residents in the country. The service allows users to interact directly with the virtual assistant on the bank’s platform, helping them access published data and providing them with quick and accurate information. Residents who are interested in taking advantage of the new feature would need to visit the QCB website and scan the QR code to begin interaction with the virtual assistant.

Yet the developments highlighted by X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) point to a very different reality. The Messari State of XRP Ledger Q4 2025 report provides the data to support that view. Progress did not arrive suddenly, but accumulated quietly through infrastructure, regulation, and capital. While detractors have said for years that XRP will fall to $0 , X Finance Bull challenged this narrative. He stated, “Going to zero was never the thesis for people who understood what was being built.” That perspective aligns with what the data now shows. XRP and the XRP Ledger spent years preparing for institutional scale. Q4 2025 marked the point where those efforts became measurable. I remember when they said $XRP was going to ZERO Messari just released the State of XRP Ledger Q4 2025 report. The future has never looked brighter. A year ago, no U.S. spot ETF existed. Now XRP ETFs hold over $1 billion in AUM. Reached that milestone in under four weeks.… https://t.co/AuuTxuWu9U pic.twitter.com/q033OteMQU — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) February 6, 2026 ETFs Signal Structural Demand One of the clearest signals came from the U.S. market. Spot XRP ETFs launched in November 2025. Within four weeks, they surpassed $1 billion in assets under management . Messari’s report confirms this was the fastest ETF ramp since Ethereum. This growth did not rely only on speculation. It reflected pent-up demand from investors previously blocked by custody and compliance limits. By late January 2026, ETFs held nearly 790 million XRP. That represented about 1.3% of the circulating supply. This shift changed how capital accessed XRP and anchored the asset inside regulated financial rails. RLUSD and Stablecoin Expansion Stablecoin infrastructure also matured rapidly. RLUSD did not exist 14 months earlier. By the end of 2025, it reached a $235 million market cap on the XRPL. Messari reports a 164% quarter-over-quarter increase, making it the largest stablecoin on the network. RLUSD gained traction because it launched with compliance built in. Its features position it as a settlement asset suited for institutions, not experimentation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Institutional Expansion Accelerates Real-world assets on the XRPL reached record levels in Q4. Distributed RWAs climbed to $281.2 million, up 37% quarter over quarter. Ondo’s OUSG fund, Guggenheim’s Digital Commercial Paper, and tokenized real estate in Dubai drove that growth. Brazil added government pension-linked receivables using the ledger for compliant recordkeeping. Ripple reinforced this momentum through acquisitions, including Hidden Road, GTreasury, Rail, and Palisade. It also raised $500 million at a $40 billion valuation and secured key regulatory approvals in the U.S., UK, and Singapore. The ledger itself continued evolving. Permissioned Domains have launched , and native lending is in development. Credentials, multipurpose tokens, and compliance controls now exist at the protocol level.

Key Takeaways: Two California teens allegedly traveled over 600 miles to carry out a violent home invasion targeting $66 million in cryptocurrency. Police arrested the suspects shortly after they fled the scene and recovered restraints and a 3D-printed firearm. Investigators say unknown contacts on an encrypted messaging app directed the plot and funded supplies. According to court records cited by local media , the 16- and 17-year-old suspects drove more than 600 miles from San Luis Obispo County and arrived at a residence in the Sweetwater Ranch neighborhood on the morning of Jan. 31 wearing delivery-style uniforms resembling those used by shipping carriers. Investigators say they forced entry into the home, restrained two adults with duct tape and demanded access to digital assets. One victim denied holding cryptocurrency, after which the confrontation escalated into physical assault. Police Stop Suspects After Violent Home Invasion Attempt Police were alerted when an adult son elsewhere in the house called emergency services. Officers arriving at the property found a struggle underway and one victim screaming. The suspects fled in a blue Subaru but were stopped at a dead end shortly afterward. Authorities recovered zip ties, duct tape, stolen license plates and a 3D-printed firearm without ammunition. It remains unclear whether the weapon was functional. Both teens were initially placed in juvenile detention but prosecutors intend to try them as adults. Each faces eight counts including kidnapping, aggravated assault and burglary, while the older suspect also faces an unlawful flight charge. They were later released on $50,000 bail and fitted with electronic monitoring devices.

The contacts, identified only as “Red” and “8,” allegedly supplied the address and sent $1,000 for disguises and equipment purchased at retail stores. The suspect also claimed he had been pressured into participating after being invited on a trip to “tie people up” for access to cryptocurrency. Wrench Attacks on Crypto Holders Rise Sharply in 2025 The case reflects a broader rise in so-called wrench attacks , physical assaults aimed at forcing crypto holders to hand over private keys. Security researcher Jameson Lopp’s public database lists roughly 70 such incidents in 2025, a sharp increase from the previous year. The Scottsdale attack is the first recorded US case of 2026, though many incidents are believed to go unreported. Security analysts say criminals are increasingly using leaked personal data to identify targets and recruiting young perpetrators online to reduce traceability. A recent industry breach involving customer identity information has been cited by investigators as a factor increasing exposure risks. Authorities have not linked the incident to separate cryptocurrency ransom demands reported the same day in Tucson, about two hours away.

However, while BTC and most other alts crashed to their lowest levels since the US presidential elections in late 2024, ADA went even further, dropping to $0.222 (on Bitstamp and other exchanges) for the first time since June 2023. Despite recovering slightly to $0.27, the token is still 34% down monthly. Moreover, it has plunged by 80% since its cycle top at $1.33 marked in late 2024. Consequently, we asked ChatGPT and Gemini whether the worst is behind ADA or if there is more pain around the corner. ChatGPT Says… ChatGPT began with some harsh words for Cardano investors, suggesting that the decline to the $0.22 area is “not just another routine dip.” Instead, it believes it represents a “structural breakdown of long-term support, confirming that sellers remain firmly in control.” This was proven after the asset plunged below key support levels at $0.40, $0.30, and even $0.25 (which was later reclaimed, though). What could spell further trouble for ADA looking ahead is that these consecutive price drops suggest that “the buy-the-dip demand has steadily weakened” lately. As such, all eyes have now turned to the $0.20 support, which has become the “line in the sand.” If ADA is to fall below that psychological level, the most realistic target during the ongoing bear phase would be a dip to $0.15-$0.16. However, ChatGPT outlined a more extreme capitulation scenario, in which the token plummets to $0.10-$0.12. “While this may sound shocking, large-cap altcoins have historically lost 80-90% from cycle highs during severe downturns. ADA is not immune to that pattern,” it concluded. Gemini’s Take Dumping below $0.30 meant that ADA’s daily chart has turned into a “falling knife,” said Gemini. This breakdown below the multi-year support was the “final nail in the coffin for many long-term holders.” On its way down, the asset dumped below its 200-day MA (at around $0.45), and it obliterated millions in leveraged longs. Gemini’s “nightmare” scenario envisions a drop to even below $0.10 if certain factors align in an adverse manner: “If Bitcoin capitulates to $55K in the coming weeks, ADA risks losing its status as a “major” altcoin. A breakdown below $0.15 opens a liquidity vacuum all the way down to $0.09. While this sounds impossible, remember that “impossible” things happen regularly in crypto winters,” it warned.

The altcoin lost 0.51% in the last 24 hours. SNX coin has support around $0.271. On February 8, 2026, Synthetix price analysis reveals a bearish trend, as resistance remains strong around immediate Fib levels. The altcoin’s price decreased to $0.293 over the past 24 hours. Overall, the cryptocurrency lost 0.51% in the last 24 hours as it continues its bearish trend. Selling pressure appeared again when the coin touched $0.307 on Friday, and the asset continues to lose value today. SNX/USD 1-day chart analysis The one-day price chart of the Synthetix coin confirmed a downward market trend following a series of corrections, as sellers were also in charge previously. The altcoin price is under correction as its price decreased to $0.293 today. A new red candlestick on the price chart highlights the presence of selling pressure. The distance between the Bollinger Bands defines the intensity of volatility. This distance is increasing, leading to high volatility at the moment. Currently, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, indicating resistance, sits at $0.470. Meanwhile, its lower limit, serving as support, has moved to $0.271. SNX/USD 1-day price chart. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator curve is trending in the neutral area, currently at 31. This situation suggests that sellers are currently controlling the momentum, and bearish pressure might increase if they continue to lead as the coin slowly sheds. SNX/USD 4-hour chart analysis The four-hour price analysis of Synthetix Coin signals buying interest for the coin at the current price level. The SNX/USD price slightly increased to $0.293 after going through a small recovery in the last four hours. However, the low volatility levels suggest a decreased probability of an upcoming reversal or further price oscillation, as the recovery itself is insufficient. The upper Bollinger Band has shifted to $0.314, marking the resistance level. The lower Bollinger Band has moved to $0.274, showing the support level. SNX/USD 4-hour price chart. Source: TradingView The RSI indicator is in the neutral region. Its value slightly increased to 41 over the past four hours. The almost horizontal curve on the RSI graph reflects a shift in market sentiment. The bears have been dominating the price chart for the past few hours, but now the bulls are trying to take the lead. This trend has also resulted in a relatively balanced trading setup for intraday traders for the time being.

Synthetix Coin price analysis shows a downward trend regarding current market events. The coin’s price has decreased to $0.293 in the last 24 hours. If the bearish momentum continues, the SNX price might retest support at the $0.271 level. Conversely, if buying interest overwhelms, the altcoin may again jump to the $0.314 level. Is SNX a good investment? The Synthetix rebranding in 2018 rejuvenated the ecosystem, which has grown continually with multiple listed synths. Despite concerns over the stability of its stablecoins, SNX, the native token, is set to mark new records, as seen in Cryptopolitan’s SNX price predictions from 2026 to 2032. It is expected that SNX will reach $2.03 by 2030. Why is SNX down? The cryptocurrency market is in a bearish mode today, and SNX is following suit. From a larger perspective, the token is getting negative sentiment as the SNX price decreased to $0.293, losing 0.51% of its total value in the last few hours. What is the target price for SNX? The target price for SNX is $0.631193 for the current year, which is still quite higher than the current Synthetix price. Will SNX reach $5? The current price action does not justify predicting a $5 target. However, in the cryptocurrency market, things change rapidly, and if the token maintains its price levels, a recovery can be initiated. It can be expected that SNX will reach a maximum of $2.74 by 2032. However, this is not investment advice, and anyone willing to purchase SNX tokens should seek independent professional consultation. Will SNX reach $1? Considering the future price movements, SNX will reach the $1 level by 2028. The last time SNX was seen at the $1 level was in November 2025. Will SNX reach $10? According to crypto analysts’ price predictions, SNX may not reach this level in the next five years. Considering the current market cap of the token, it seems like a distant target. Will SNX reach $100? No, market analysts don’t expect SNX to reach $100 during the next 10 years, considering the long term Synthetix price forecast. How high can SNX go? The highest expected price for SNX is $2.74, which it will achieve in 2032. Does SNX have a future? SNX is trading significantly lower than its mid-December price levels, making it an ideal time for buyers to enter the market. Given its current low price and a favorable future valuation of $2.74 by the end of 2032, the asset appears to be a worthwhile investment. However, one’s own research is advised.

The HAV Airdrop Campaign ran between 4 and 14 February 2018 and offered two million tokens for around $1 million. On November 30, 2018, Synthetic announced its rebranding from Havven. This included renaming its native token, HAV (Havven token), to SNX. The contract address did not change. It registered its lowest price at $0.03258 on January 5, 2019. Unlike most mega-altcoins, SNX did not rally after launch; it consistently traded below $0.5 until the last quarter of 2019. In 2020, it made a mega rally to $7.3, as per historical SNX market data. In the 2021 bull cycle, it shot higher, and on February 14, it registered its all-time high at $28.77. It reversed to $5 in July before pumping again to $15 in September. In the 2022 crypto winter, SNX shed most of its value as it retreated to the $2 mark by the end of the year. In 2023, it consistently traded between $1.5 and $3 until the last quarter, when it had its break. In March 2024, SNX reached a high of $5; in July, SNX came down from the $2.01 to $1.65 range. In August 2024, the SNX token’s price dipped as low as $1.20, and September saw a maximum price of $1.71. In October 2024, SNX dipped and became rangebound. It closed the month with a $1.31 price tag, while December saw a stream of improved prices with a peak price of $3.38. During the remainder of December, SNX kept shedding its value, and it entered 2025 with a wave of correction to $1.90. The highest price of the SNX token was 2.27 in January, but it corrected to $1.20 in February. In March, SNX price declined to $0.89, and in April it further descended to the $0.77 range. In May 2025, it saw some recovery to $0.926, improving its market capitalization, and in July, the token peaked at $0.781, showing significant growth. From August to September, SNX’s average price remained around $0.65 to $0.67, and in October 2025, SNX was trading above $1, finally peaking at $2.58 on the 13th of the month.

Argentina’s first public Bitcoin Treasury model Argentina’s public Bitcoin treasury represents a significant advancement in the use of cryptocurrencies in one of the busiest markets in South America. In this regard, Zonda Bitcoin Capital stands out as a plan that combines tax benefits, exposure to ETFs, and a public company structure to increase access to Bitcoin. A public Bitcoin treasury is a publicly traded business that primarily holds Bitcoin (BTC), giving investors price exposure without actually purchasing or keeping the asset. Zonda Bitcoin Capital was co-founded by Leonardo Rubinstein, former CEO of Ank and OLX Argentina, and Pablo Herman, co-founder of Swiss Medical. The firm plans to purchase BlackRock’s IBIT ETF through a US brokerage account with custody at Coinbase, aiming to reduce technical barriers and add operational rigour. The structure offers tax advantages for individuals, allows corporations to gain crypto exposure without changing mandates, and opens new product opportunities for banks and brokerages. The company also aims to increase the amount of Bitcoin per share over time, explore tokenised share issuance, and reach an initial strategic target of 1,810 BTC. XDC Network surpasses $100 million in tokenised assets in Brazil Through its collaboration with Liqi Digital Assets, XDC Network, a public blockchain centred on institutional-grade financial applications, has amassed more than $100 million in tokenised real-world assets (RWAs) in Brazil. RWAs are typical financial instruments that are represented on blockchain. Tokenisation is the process that makes it possible to register credits, securities, and other comparable assets digitally with increased operational efficiency and transparency. By 2026, the project wants to issue $500 million worth of tokens. With participation from prominent Brazilian financial institutions such as Banco Itaú, Banco ABC, Banco BV, and credit manager Milenio Capital, the majority of issuances on the network are concentrated in credit assets and regulated structures. With its near-instantaneous transaction finality, minimal costs, robust security, and conformity with the international ISO 20022 financial messaging standard, XDC Network is made for regulated markets. Company leaders claim that this milestone solidifies Brazil’s position as a leading market in the tokenisation of financial assets throughout Latin America and indicates the country’s increasing institutional adoption of blockchain. Gold’s rally fuels surge in ‘digital gold’ trading in Brazil Brazilian interest in digital copies of gold traded on the cryptocurrency market has increased amid the metal’s recent significant rise, despite a recent drop. The volume of transactions in so-called “digital gold,” such as the Pax Gold (PAXG) token, increased by around 300% in 2025, according to a survey conducted by Mercado Bitcoin (MB). According to local media outlet InfoMoney, the rate of growth indicates an increasing tendency among local investors , notwithstanding the market’s continued small size. However, according to MB, the development is a result of growing interest in several avenues for gaining exposure to gold.

One of the indicators that confirmed the emergence of the bear market was the breach of the 365-day moving average to the downside late last year. Using this metric, a prominent crypto researcher has come forward with an evaluation that shows how the current Bitcoin bear market compares to the past ones. BTC Price Is 30% Below 365-Day Moving Average In a new post on the social media platform X, CryptoQuant’s head of research, Julio Moreno, revealed that the current bear market performance compares to the ones seen in Bitcoin’s recent history. The indicator in focus in this analysis is the 365-day simple moving average (SMA) on the BTC price chart. Moreno defined the start of the bear market as the moment when the price of Bitcoin crossed below the 365-day SMA. According to the on-chain expert, the premier cryptocurrency is down by 30% so far in the current phase, making it one of the worst bear seasons in recent times. As observed in the chart above, the Bitcoin price is deeper than it is often seen at this stage of the bear market. During the 2014 bear market, the flagship cryptocurrency was barely down by 20% at this current stage of the season. The same could be said for the 2018 bear season, which was more around the 20% market at this stage. However, the price of Bitcoin might have succumbed to greater pressure during the 2022 season , as the market leader was down from its 365-day moving average by nearly 60% at this stage of the cycle. This trend is especially interesting, considering that Bitcoin is believed to have matured as an asset class. However, the world’s largest cryptocurrency still appears to witness incredible levels of volatility at the beginning of the bear market. While it is unclear when the Bitcoin price will reach a bottom, certain conditions need to be met for a turnaround to occur. One of these conditions is the apparent demand metric , which has continued to worsen over the past few weeks. As seen in the outflow numbers of the US-based Bitcoin ETFs, capital constraints have been a major issue for the premier cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $70,500, reflecting an over 2% jump in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc price|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-02-08 11:00:38

Next Wave Is Already Here,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-exec-xrp-is-emerging-as-backbone-next-wave-is-already-here/,"Infrastructure shifts do not begin with price action or narratives. They start with systems reaching operational readiness. Ripple’s latest Institutional DeFi roadmap captures that stage for the XRP Ledger. Reece Merrick, Ripple’s Senior Executive Officer and Managing Director, summarized the direction clearly. Merrick believes XRP is becoming the backbone for real-world financial infrastructure. He stated that the XRP Ledger is evolving into “a daily use layer for institutions,” with XRP “powering settlement, FX, collateral, and on-chain credit.” The roadmap he referenced outlines how that evolution is already underway. XRP is emerging as the backbone for real-world financial infrastructure. Take a look at the Institutional DeFi roadmap below. It lays out exactly how the XRP Ledger is evolving into a daily use layer for institutions, with XRP powering settlement, FX, collateral, and on-chain… — Reece Merrick (@reece_merrick) February 6, 2026 XRP Embedded In Settlement and FX Activity The XRP Ledger now supports regulated participation through Permissioned Domains and on-ledger credentials. These features allow institutions to operate in compliant environments while retaining real-time settlement. Within these structures, XRP serves as the native settlement asset. XRP acts as the auto-bridge in FX transactions across stablecoins and tokenized assets. Each transaction consumes XRP through network fees, directly tying institutional activity to the asset’s utility. As stablecoin issuance and cross-border FX volumes expand on XRPL, XRP remains central to execution. The roadmap confirms that these workflows are not experimental. They are designed for daily operational use, with compliance and efficiency built into the base layer. Collateral Management Moves On-Chain Collateral efficiency is a priority for financial institutions, and XRPL now supports it at the protocol level. Token Escrow enables conditional settlement for both IOUs and Multi-Purpose Tokens. This allows structured collateral releases without external smart contracts. Batch Transactions add atomic delivery-versus-payment functionality. This removes settlement risk in multi-asset transactions and supports use cases common in repo and liquidity management markets. These actions require reserves and transaction fees, both denominated in XRP. Multi-Purpose Tokens extend this framework further. They allow institutions to issue structured financial instruments with embedded rules, metadata, and restrictions. XRP underpins these activities through network usage and reserve requirements. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Native Credit Markets Take Shape The roadmap also details the upcoming introduction of on-ledger credit through the XLS-65 and XLS-66 Lending Protocol . This system enables fixed-term, fixed-rate lending directly on XRPL while keeping underwriting off-chain. Single Asset Vaults pool capital under configurable permissions. Loans execute and settle on-ledger, with repayment automation built into the protocol. XRP can be borrowed, lent, and used as the default bridge asset within these credit flows. Evernorth’s stated intent to utilize the Lending Protocol highlights how institutions plan to deploy these tools in practice rather than theory. Infrastructure Now in Place Merrick concluded that “the foundation is set.” The roadmap supports that statement with live features, scheduled upgrades, and defined institutional use cases. XRP now operates as a settlement asset, liquidity bridge, collateral anchor, and credit instrument within a single ledger.

Being their ultimate goal to democratize access to all private equity sectors. Positioning itself at the intersection of yachting and on-chain finance, Investing Yachts is built to remove traditional barriers associated with yacht investing—such as high minimum capital requirements, illiquidity, and operational complexity—by offering a token-based structure intended to be tradable on markets and supported by a managed charter fleet. How the model is designed to work At the core of the Investing Yachts model, the $YATE ecosystem connects charter activity to tokenholder incentives through a rules-based framework: Charter profit distribution: Up to 65% of annual net charter profits is intended to be distributed to tokenholders who lock $YATE into protocol “vaults,” with different lock periods associated with different maximum shares of the profit pool. Buyback & burn: A defined portion of net profits, 10%, is earmarked for buying back tokens and burning them, aiming to reduce circulating supply over time. Asset-tied issuance: New tokens are being minted in connection with acquiring additional yachts or other real-world assets, using a NAV-based issuance framework designed to align token supply with the underlying asset base and charter activity. $YATE Token Pre-Sale Investing Yachts states that the $YATE pre-sale is scheduled to open on February 25, 2026, with the goal of expanding community participation ahead of broader exchange availability. As described on the website and in the whitepaper documentation, the pre-sale pricing is structured as follows: Initial price: 0.10 USDT per $YATE Dynamic increase: +0.75% price increase every 24 hours Duration: 9 months Target post–pre-sale listing price: 1.00 USDT The documentation also outlines vesting terms for pre-sale tokens, as well as other mechanisms aligned to provide sustainable growth stability for the project, rewarding long-term holders and early adopters. Broker Network and Market Positioning The global yacht charter and yachting services market represents a multi-billion-dollar industry, traditionally limited to a small group of high-capital participants. Investing Yachts aims to use its RWA structure to broaden access by enabling community participation through $YATE, bringing a token-based framework to a segment that has historically remained offline and illiquid. Investing Yachts has established relationships with experienced yacht brokers and industry intermediaries to support fleet sourcing and charter deployment. These connections are intended to strengthen the project’s ability to identify acquisition opportunities, negotiate terms, and access vessels aligned with demand in key charter regions.

57838693,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/?p=33172,1770548679,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png,INVESTING YACHTS Launches RWA Yacht Charter Model,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/investing-yachts-launches-rwa-yacht-charter-model/,"Ibiza, Spain, February 8th, 2026, Chainwire Investing Yachts today introduced its real-world asset (RWA) yacht charter model, a blockchain-based approach designed to tokenize exposure to potential double-digit revenue generated by luxury yacht charter operations via their upcoming $YATE token . Being their ultimate goal to democratize access to all private equity sectors. Positioning itself at the intersection of yachting and on-chain finance, Investing Yachts is built to remove traditional barriers associated with yacht investing—such as high minimum capital requirements, illiquidity, and operational complexity—by offering a token-based structure intended to be tradable on markets and supported by a managed charter fleet. How the model is designed to work At the core of the Investing Yachts model, the $YATE ecosystem connects charter activity to tokenholder incentives through a rules-based framework: Charter profit distribution: Up to 65% of annual net charter profits is intended to be distributed to tokenholders who lock $YATE into protocol “vaults,” with different lock periods associated with different maximum shares of the profit pool. Buyback & burn: A defined portion of net profits, 10%, is earmarked for buying back tokens and burning them, aiming to reduce circulating supply over time. Asset-tied issuance: New tokens are being minted in connection with acquiring additional yachts or other real-world assets, using a NAV-based issuance framework designed to align token supply with the underlying asset base and charter activity. $YATE Token Pre-Sale Investing Yachts states that the $YATE pre-sale is scheduled to open on February 25, 2026 , with the goal of expanding community participation ahead of broader exchange availability. As described on the website and in the whitepaper documentation, the pre-sale pricing is structured as follows: Initial price: 0.10 USDT per $YATE Dynamic increase: +0.75% price increase every 24 hours Duration: 9 months Target post–pre-sale listing price: 1.00 USDT The documentation also outlines vesting terms for pre-sale tokens, as well as other mechanisms aligned to provide sustainable growth stability for the project, rewarding long-term holders and early adopters. Broker Network and Market Positioning The global yacht charter and yachting services market represents a multi-billion-dollar industry , traditionally limited to a small group of high-capital participants. Investing Yachts aims to use its RWA structure to broaden access by enabling community participation through $YATE , bringing a token-based framework to a segment that has historically remained offline and illiquid. Investing Yachts has established relationships with experienced yacht brokers and industry intermediaries to support fleet sourcing and charter deployment. These connections are intended to strengthen the project’s ability to identify acquisition opportunities, negotiate terms, and access vessels aligned with demand in key charter regions. Community and updates Investing Yachts is publishing updates via social channels and encourages supporters to follow the project for pre-sale announcements, documentation updates, and roadmap progress: X: https://x.com/Investingyachts Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/investing.yachts/ Telegram: https://t.me/+kLdobl6TM2kzYzJk About Investing Yachts Investing Yachts is a blockchain platform described as an RWA project focused on tokenizing exposure to luxury yacht charter economics through the $YATE token (Ethereum ERC-20). Investing Yachts lists a management team and advisory group spanning technology, yacht operations, finance, media, and international legal expertise. It counts on leadership with backgrounds in algorithmic trading, yacht charter operations, and institutional markets, including experience at major international banks.

According to well-informed industry sources, the shipments are expected to occur after the Lunar New Year holiday. Samsung Electronics is also set to become the first memory maker to commercialize what is widely seen as a game-changing chip for AI computing, the sources added. The company has plans to start shipping HBM4 to Nvidia as early as the third week of February. Nvidia is expected to use the memory in its next-generation AI accelerator platform, Vera Rubin. Samsung set to begin HBM4 shipment this month The move signals a turn in fortune for Samsung, which had faced questions and criticisms over its competitiveness in earlier HBM generations. With the HBM4, Samsung is aiming to close the gap and even move ahead of crosstown rival SK Hynix , which had gained an early lead in the sector thanks to the surging demand from AI data centers. According to an industry official, the move gives Samsung the much-needed recovery it needed in the technology sector. The industry source also mentioned that by being the first to mass-produce the highest performance HBM4, it gives the company a clear advantage in shaping the market the way it wants. Nvidia is expected to unveil Vera Rubin accelerators incorporating the HBM4 at its annual conference, GTC 2026, which is expected to be held later this month. Samsung mentioned that the shipment timing was concluded after coordination with Nvidia’s product roadmap and downstream system-level testing schedules. Aside from speed, Samsung’s technological approach to the product is also notable. From the onset, the company planned to improve upon the standards set by JEDEC, adopting the industry’s first combination of a sixth-generation 10-nanometer-class DRAM (1c) process with a 4-nanometer logic die produced through its own boundary. As a result, Samsung’s HBM4 delivers data transfer speeds of about 11.7 Gbps per second, which is well above the JEDEC’s 8 Gbps standards. The figure also represents a 37% improvement over the standard and a 22% gain over the previous HMB3E generation. According to the sources, memory bandwidth per stack reaches up to 3 terabytes per second, which is about 2.4 times higher than its predecessor. In addition, it boasts a 12-high stacking design that enables a capacity of up to 36 gigabytes. With its future 16-high configuration, capacity could grow as much as 48GB, the industry estimates show. Further improvements are expected before mass production Despite making use of cutting-edge processes, Samsung has been able to achieve a stable yield ahead of mass production, with further improvements expected to happen as output scales up, industry sources note. Samsung has also talked about power efficiency, noting that HBM4 is designed to maximize computing performance while reducing energy consumption, helping data centers lower electricity use and cooling costs. The company also expects its HBM sales volume this year to more than triple from last year and has decided to install additional production lines at its Pyeongtaek Campus Line 4 to expand its capacity. The facility is expected to produce roughly 100,000 to 120,000 wafers every month, dedicated to 1c DRAM used in HBM4 products, industry sources added. Last year, Samsung had already built a monthly capacity of around 60,000 to 70,000 wafers for the 1c DRAM process. With the planned expansion, the total 1c output planned for HBM4 could rise to about 200,000 wafers per month, accounting for roughly a quarter of Samsung’s total DRAM production capacity of approximately 780,000 wafers. The HBM4 market is expected to be dominated by Samsung and SK hynix, with US-based Micron Technology already seen as out of the race. According to market tracker SemiAnalysis, SK hynix is expected to take about 70% of the HBM4 market, while Samsung will account for the remaining 30%.

In this context, Mike McGlone, senior commodity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence , believes Bitcoin’s recent price action below $70,000 signals a broader mean reversion after years of speculative excess. In an X post on February 7, McGlone stated that Bitcoin is a product of the post–global financial crisis environment, where abundant liquidity fueled a prolonged inflation in risk assets. As that cycle matures, Bitcoin appears to be gravitating back toward its historical mean and most frequently traded range, which aligns closely with the $64,000 level he highlighted. He supported his assessment with a weekly Bitcoin chart showing repeated tests of the mid-$60,000 area, while volume data highlights heavy trading activity around $64,000. This indicates the level has acted as a structural support, absorbing selling pressure during recent pullbacks. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: Bloomberg Intelligence Bitcoin’s crash impact on stocks The chart’s comparison with the S&P 500 highlights Bitcoin’s role as a leading indicator for broader risk sentiment. Historically, sustained Bitcoin weakness has coincided with or preceded equity market drawdowns. With stock indices still elevated, a failure to hold $64,000 could signal rising stress across risk assets. “The graphic shows Bitcoin reverting to its mean and mode from the election year at about $64,000 — a potential line in the sand. If $64,000 is breached, dominoes can tumble, with the stock market potentially next,” he said. McGlone cautioned that a decisive break below this level could accelerate downside momentum, prompting a wider reassessment of risk exposure and potentially spilling over into equities and other risk-sensitive markets. Bitcoin price volatility His outlook comes as Bitcoin rebounded modestly after a volatile week that saw the cryptocurrency briefly dip below $61,000, confirming a deepening bear phase. The flagship digital asset has fallen nearly 45% from its all-time high of approximately $126,000 in October 2025, erasing post-election gains and entering what analysts describe as a classic crypto-winter correction. On February 5–6, BTC experienced its steepest single-day drop since late 2022, plunging 15% before surging 11% in a sharp rebound that briefly pushed prices back above $70,000. Notably, the crash was triggered by several factors, including macroeconomic pressures such as tariff uncertainties, Federal Reserve policy doubts, and broader risk-asset volatility, alongside a reversal in institutional flows into U.S. Bitcoin ETFs, which have recorded net outflows in early 2026 after strong inflows previously. At the same time, on-chain metrics show mixed signals: retail wallets are accumulating aggressively on dips, defending support near the $60,000–$63,000 range, while larger holders are distributing, capping upside momentum. By press time, Bitcoin was changing hands at $69,464, up about 2% over the past 24 hours, while on the weekly timeframe, the cryptocurrency remains down roughly 11%.

The draft circular is now open for public consultation and aims to bring clarity to how digital assets will be taxed under the country’s emerging regulatory regime. Under the proposal, individual investors: both residents and non-residents would owe a 0.1% personal income tax on the gross value of every crypto transfer they make through licensed service providers. This mirrors the turnover-based tax applied to stock transactions in the Vietnamese market. At the same time, the draft clarifies that crypto transfers and trading activities would remain exempt from value-added tax (VAT), reaffirming the government’s view of digital assets as financial instruments rather than goods or services liable for consumption tax. Officials say the turnover-based approach eliminates the need to calculate net gains on every trade, simplifying compliance for investors and aligning crypto with the established securities tax model. As part of the consultation, authorities are also seeking feedback on how best to enforce the tax and what systems licensed providers must put in place to collect and remit it. Corporate Tax Rules and Market Structure The draft framework also outlines how corporate investors would be taxed under the new regime. Firms established in Vietnam that generate income from crypto transfers would face the standard 20% corporate income tax, calculated on net profits after deducting purchase costs and related transaction expenses. Foreign-based corporate investors would be liable for a 0.1% tax on the value of each transfer, similar to the levy for individual investors. Lawmakers are formalizing the definition of crypto assets as “digital assets that rely on cryptographic or similar technologies for issuance, storage, and transfer verification,” detail that could help extend legal certainty to market participants. At the same time, the draft includes strict licensing requirements for digital asset exchanges, such as a minimum charter capital of 10 trillion Vietnamese dong (about $408 million) and limits on foreign ownership to 49%. These tax proposals are part of Vietnam’s five-year pilot program for digital asset markets, launched in September 2025. Officials have said the pilot will inform longer-term legislation and oversight mechanisms as the country works to balance investor protection with the rapid growth of crypto adoption.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-02-08 11:41:16

Long-Term Holder Metric Says Watch $34.5K,https://coinpaper.com/14388/bitcoin-price-prediction-is-a-15-drop-coming-long-term-holder-metric-says-watch-34-5-k,"Bitcoin's latest pullback is pushing more holders into paper losses, while a separate cost basis gauge highlights a possible downside level near the mid $30,000s if past cycle patterns repeat. Together, the charts frame the selloff as a stress test for conviction, with unrealized losses rising and long term holder levels back in focus. Bitcoin slides as relative unrealized loss rises to multi-year highs Bitcoin’s relative unrealized loss climbed to one of its highest readings of the past cycle as price pulled back from recent highs, according to Glassnode data. The metric, which tracks the share of coins held at a paper loss, rose sharply during the latest selloff, signaling that a larger portion of supply moved underwater as spot price slipped from the upper range into lower levels. At the same time, Bitcoin’s dollar price remained well below recent peaks, and therefore the move pushed more short-term holders into loss during the decline. BTC Relative Unrealized Loss. Source: Glassnode The chart shows earlier spikes in relative unrealized loss lining up with broad drawdowns in 2018 to 2019 and again during the 2022 bear phase. In each case, the orange loss bands expanded as price fell and then narrowed as price stabilized and recovered. This time, the loss share expanded again as Bitcoin rolled over from late-cycle highs, and meanwhile price stayed under prior resistance. As a result, the latest reading places current conditions closer to historical stress zones than to periods of broad profit. Even so, the metric has not stayed elevated for long stretches outside major downturns. After past spikes, loss pressure faded as selling slowed and price found support. Now, the data show loss rising during the pullback while price trends lower than the recent range. Therefore, the current structure reflects renewed stress among holders following the decline, with the indicator expanding during weakness and compressing during rebounds, a pattern that has tracked cycle drawdowns across prior periods. Analyst ties bitcoin downside target to long term holder realized price Bitcoin could bottom near $34,500 if it drops about 15% below its long term holder realized price, according to crypto trader TedPillows, who shared a Bitcoin Magazine Pro chart tracking the metric against BTC’s spot price. TedPillows said each cycle bottom has formed roughly 15% under the long term holder realized price, a cost basis style measure that reflects the average price paid by coins held for longer periods. Bitcoin Long Term Holder Realized Price.

According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, the premier cryptocurrency reached a price of $71,009.99 on the Binance USDT trading pair. This surge represents a pivotal moment, potentially signaling renewed institutional confidence and shifting macroeconomic tailwinds for the broader crypto ecosystem. Consequently, analysts are scrutinizing the momentum’s sustainability and underlying catalysts. Bitcoin Price Breaches a Critical Psychological Level The ascent past $71,000 marks Bitcoin’s highest valuation in recent weeks. This movement is not an isolated event but part of a broader recovery narrative. Market data reveals consistent buying pressure across major exchanges, with Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken all reporting elevated volumes. Historically, such breaks above round-number resistances often trigger further algorithmic and retail buying. Moreover, the timing coincides with key macroeconomic data releases, suggesting a complex interplay of factors. Several technical indicators now flash bullish signals. For instance, the Bitcoin price has moved decisively above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. This golden cross configuration traditionally suggests strengthening intermediate-term momentum. Additionally, trading volume has increased by approximately 35% compared to the weekly average, confirming the move’s conviction. Market depth on order books also shows robust support forming near the $69,000 level, potentially establishing a new floor. Contextualizing the Current Crypto Rally This rally occurs within a specific financial landscape. Firstly, recent statements from the U.S. Federal Reserve have hinted at a potential pause in interest rate hikes. Such a policy shift typically weakens the U.S. dollar, making scarce assets like Bitcoin more attractive. Secondly, the final approval phase for U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs continues to funnel institutional capital into the market. These funds have accumulated substantial BTC holdings, directly reducing available supply on open markets. Furthermore, the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, projected for April 2024, casts a long shadow. This pre-programmed reduction in miner block rewards will cut new Bitcoin supply in half. Historically, halving events have preceded major bull markets, as seen in 2012, 2016, and 2020. Investors appear to be positioning themselves ahead of this supply shock, creating sustained demand pressure. Analyzing the Drivers Behind the Surge Multiple converging factors are fueling Bitcoin’s impressive climb. A primary driver is the sustained institutional adoption narrative. Major asset managers now publicly advocate for Bitcoin as a digital gold and inflation hedge. Corporate treasury allocations, though slower than in 2021, continue to trickle in. Simultaneously, regulatory clarity in jurisdictions like the European Union, with its MiCA framework, provides a more stable operating environment for crypto businesses. On-chain data provides compelling evidence of accumulation. The number of Bitcoin addresses holding 1,000 BTC or more, often called “whales,” has remained stable. However, addresses holding between 10 and 100 BTC have grown significantly. This trend suggests accumulation by high-net-worth individuals and smaller institutions. The Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) metric, which tracks overall investor profit, has also moved into a positive but not euphoric zone, indicating room for growth before a major market top. Macroeconomic Factors: Weakening dollar index (DXY), shifting Fed policy expectations. Institutional Flows: Consistent inflows into spot and futures-based Bitcoin investment products. Technical Breakout: Overcoming key resistance levels, triggering automated buy orders. On-Chain Strength: High network security (hash rate), low exchange balances indicating holding behavior. Comparative Market Performance and Impact Bitcoin’s dominance rate, its market share relative to the entire crypto market, has also edged higher during this move. This suggests the rally is being led by Bitcoin rather than altcoins, a pattern typical of early-stage bull markets. The performance of other major assets provides context: Asset 24h Performance Key Note Bitcoin (BTC) +5.2% Leader, broke $71k resistance Ethereum (ETH) +3.8% Following BTC’s lead Binance Coin (BNB) +2.1% Exchange token, correlated move Gold (XAU) -0.3% Traditional safe-haven under pressure The rally’s impact extends beyond price charts. Mining profitability has increased, incentivizing greater network security. Developer activity on Bitcoin’s Layer 2 networks, like the Lightning Network, also remains high. This indicates long-term building continues irrespective of short-term price action. Furthermore, global search interest for “Bitcoin” and “crypto” has spiked, reflecting renewed public attention. Expert Perspectives on Sustainability and Risks Market analysts offer measured perspectives on the rally’s longevity. Many cite the importance of the $71,000 level as a support-turned-resistance-turned-support zone. A sustained hold above this price for several weekly closes would be a strongly bullish technical signal. However, experts also caution about volatility. The crypto market remains susceptible to sudden shifts in global risk sentiment, regulatory news, or liquidity events on leveraged trading platforms. Risk factors are ever-present. Regulatory scrutiny, particularly in the United States, remains a headwind. Potential sell pressure from large holders, such as government-seized Bitcoin or assets from bankrupt estates, could temporarily impact price. Additionally, traditional market corrections could spur a “risk-off” environment where all speculative assets, including crypto, face selling pressure. Therefore, a balanced view acknowledges the positive momentum while respecting inherent market risks. Conclusion Bitcoin’s decisive break above $71,000 represents a major technical and psychological achievement for the cryptocurrency market. This move is underpinned by a confluence of macroeconomic shifts, sustained institutional interest, and positive technical indicators. While the path forward will undoubtedly include volatility, the current **Bitcoin price** action reinforces its role as a leading digital asset. The market now watches to see if this level consolidates as a new base for further exploration of all-time highs. Ultimately, this rally highlights Bitcoin’s ongoing evolution within the global financial system. FAQs Q1: What exactly caused Bitcoin to rise above $71,000? The rise is attributed to several factors: anticipation of the 2024 halving event, increased institutional investment via ETFs, a potentially softer U.S. monetary policy, and a technical breakout that triggered automated buying algorithms. Q2: Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? Investment decisions depend on individual risk tolerance and financial goals. While the trend is positive, cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile. Experts recommend thorough research and considering dollar-cost averaging rather than lump-sum investments at market peaks. Q3: How does this price compare to Bitcoin’s all-time high? Bitcoin’s all-time high, reached in November 2021, was approximately $69,000. The move above $71,000 therefore represents a new nominal record high for the asset, a significant milestone. Q4: Will other cryptocurrencies follow Bitcoin’s rise? Historically, major rallies in Bitcoin’s price often lead to increased interest and capital flow into the broader cryptocurrency market, a phenomenon known as “altcoin season.” However, Bitcoin typically leads the initial charge, with other assets following if the bullish sentiment persists. Q5: What are the main risks to this current rally? Key risks include unexpected hawkish turns from central banks, negative regulatory developments in major economies, large-scale sell-offs from Bitcoin whales or government-held assets, and a general decline in global risk appetite that affects all speculative markets.

Uniswap, a DeFi protocol founded in 2018 by former mechanical engineer Hayden Adams. The Uniswap exchange is a 100% on-chain automated market maker (AMM) protocol on the Ethereum blockchain. The AMM allows DeFi users to swap ether (ETH) for any ERC-20 token without intermediaries, solving many liquidity problems most exchanges face. Uniswap’s unique features and utility make its token, UNI, attractive to traders and investors. Will UNI reach $100? How high can UNI go in five years? Let’s take a look at Uniswap’s technical analysis and price prediction to provide answers to these queries.

The altcoin is pulling back today, but it remains up 0.72% for the past 24 hours. UNI coin has support around the $3.12 level. On February 8, 2026, Uniswap (UNI) price analysis reveals a bearish trend for the day. Over the past 24 hours, the altcoin’s price decreased to $3.49, but it managed to report a minimal 0.72% gain; however, the price pattern still seems to be following the larger downtrend with small bullish spikes in between. The downward momentum indicates that selling pressure remains strong, as the asset began its correction near the $3.64 mark, but support for UNI is also established at the $3.12 level. Uniswap price analysis on the daily time frame The one-day price chart for Uniswap confirms a slow downward trend in the market. The UNI/USD pair is hovering near the $3.49 level as the bearish trend continues. The bearish push has slightly decreased the price, as red candlesticks on the chart signify selling momentum. The distance between the Bollinger Bands highlights the intensity of volatility. This distance is slowly expanding, leading to increased volatility. Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance, has shifted to $5.37, whereby its lower limit, indicating support, has moved to $3.12. UNI/USD 1-day price chart. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is trending in the oversold region. The indicator’s value was recorded at 29 today. The downward curve on the RSI signifies a bearish trend, and more instability can be expected if the selling momentum intensifies and the indicator’s score decreases further. Uniswap price analysis on the 4-hour chart The four-hour chart analysis of Uniswap shows a weak buying momentum, as the price is stagnating below the resistance of $3.75. This is evidenced by its price hovering near $3.49 over the past four hours; it may increase further in the coming hours if traders continue buying more, though the likelihood remains low. Moreover, decreasing volatility signifies a lower chance of a reversal or further price oscillation. The Bollinger Bands are covering too small of an area, leading to decreasing volatility levels. This low volatility signals greater market predictability. The upper Bollinger Band has shifted to $3.75, indicating the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger Band has moved to $3.12, establishing the support point. UNI/USD 4-hour price chart. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator’s value has been maintained at 44 over the past few hours, with its curve pointing sideways; however, the indicator is still trending in the neutral region. This condition suggests a balanced trading setup on the four-hour chart. Further appreciation in the coin’s value is possible only if buyers succeed in conquering resistance zones in the next few hours.

Uniswap price analysis suggests a bearish outlook for current market trends. The coin’s price is retreating in the current session despite reporting minor gains over the past 24 hours. If sellers maintain their momentum, UNI’s price could drop toward the $3.10 range. Is Uniswap a good investment? Uniswap is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange (DEX) with massive potential. Unlike traditional exchanges, Uniswap uses an automated market-matching (AMM) system. Uniswap has shown good performance over time and is expected to reach the $11.04 level by 2027 and above $30.76 by 2032. Why is UNI down? The broader crypto market is experiencing negative market sentiment today. Most of the top cryptocurrencies are shedding, and so is UNI. How much will Uniswap be worth in 2026? The maximum UNI can reach in 2026 is $7.10, while the average price is expected to be around $5.91. Will UNI reach $20? Uniswap is trading just below the $4 range, down from $18.59, which it achieved in December last year. The current resistance levels are $4.27 and $4.83; a break above them can lead to $11. If UNI gets more support, $20 can be achieved by the year 2030, which is quite higher than its current value, making it a good option to buy UNI tokens. Will UNI reach $50? In May 2021, UNI touched $44.9, its all-time high, which is not much below $50. This possibility can arise again if the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish on political and economic factors. However, this is not investment advice, and one should seek independent professional consultation before making any investment decision. Can Uniswap reach $100 dollars? According to the Uniswap price prediction, UNI is not expected to reach near $100 by the last quarter of 2032. Though this is a five-year time frame, it’s worth waiting, as the coin’s value will increase but may not reach $100. Does UNI have a good long-term Future? UNI is the token of the famous Uniswap decentralized exchange. It has a wide user base and good liquidity, so the coin has good prospects. Market analysts expect UNI’s price to reach $30.76 by the end of 2032, substantially higher than its current price.

Uniswap historic price sentiment Uniswap price history. Source: Coinmarketcap Uniswap (UNI) token launched on September 17, 2020, starting at $3.00. It quickly rose to $7.00 before reaching an all-time low of $1.03 (CoinGecko) or $0.4190 (CoinMarketCap) on the same day. UNI ended the year at $5.00 after a gradual recovery during the 2020 bull run. In 2021, UNI surged 400% in January to $20. By March, it hit $28; on May 3, it reached an all-time high (ATH) of $44.93, skyrocketing its market capitalization. It ended the year near $18 after a significant decline. Throughout 2022, UNI continued to decline as the cryptocurrency prices kept falling, dropping to around $5.5 by June as the bearish trend persisted. The crypto market rebounded in 2023, and UNI saw bullish momentum, peaking at $7.77 on December 28. UNI began 2024 on a downtrend, briefly recovering to $15 by March 6. After mid-May, it faced selling pressure, falling to $0.14 by July 31, as UNI holders kept selling assets. It stabilized in August at around $5 and traded above $6 at the start of September. In October, UNI reached a peak of $8, and November saw a peak price of $13.58. In December, UNI soared to $18.60. In February 2025, Uniswap was trading near $12, which was below January price levels of $15. In March, it dipped further down, reaching the $7.4 range, and the descent continued into April with a price of $4.7. However, some bullish price action was observed in May, when UNI jumped to $7.5 and finally peaked at $11.74 in July. August proved a bullish month as UNI/USD reached a yearly high price of $12.31, while it remained in a downtrend in September and October. UNI traded near the $5.7 mark in early November. After surging toward $10 in mid-November, the price of UNI declined again toward $5.5 in early December. At the start of January 2026, UNI was trending near the $5.8 level, but in February its price decreased to $3.8.",Crypto Price Predictions|Uniswap,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|UNI|ARB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-02-08 12:00:00

As a result, the flagship cryptocurrency has maintained a steady decline, falling until it recently reached $60,000 — a deviation of more than 52% from its all-time high. Bitcoin currently seems to be seeing a rebound, but price action alone reflects that it could as well be one of its short-term recoveries. Interestingly, a recent on-chain evaluation suggests that the current upward movement may be driven by a significant underlying metric. Related Reading: Bitcoin Taker Buy Ratio Signals Peak Bearish Sentiment — Relief Soon? What The Bitcoin Sharpe Ratio Is Saying In a Quicktake post on CryptoQuant, Darkfost reveals that the Bitcoin Sharpe Ratio is now at a zone historically relevant to the ends of bear markets. The Sharpe Ratio is a risk-adjusted performance metric that measures how much return an asset (Bitcoin, in this case) generates for risk taken. A high ratio signals that returns are strong in relation to risks taken; a declining ratio, on the other hand, reflects weakening returns, while risk remains elevated. On the severe end of the metric, a very low or negative Sharpe Ratio is a sign that market participants are taking very high risks for poor or negative returns. It is worth noting that very low Sharpe ratios are frequently seen during deep bear markets or even capitulation phases. According to historical data, Darkfost explains that the Sharpe Ratio is currently at a level so low as to be reminiscent of the final phases of past bear markets. This means that the Bitcoin price holds a higher practical risk, compared to returns, for current investors. Notably, the Sharpe ratio is not just at a low point, but continues in a steady state of decline. This, according to the market quant, is a sign that Bitcoin’s performance is yet to be attractive to any willing risk-taker. However, it is this specific dynamic that sets the pace for a turnaround in Bitcoin’s price. This is because sustained poor returns typically force capitulation events, where weaker hands are flushed out; this eventually sets the stage for renewed accumulation among stronger hands. Related Reading: Forget A Bitcoin Yearly Top, BTC Price Might Have Hit A 16-Year Cyclical Peak Two Main Approaches To Consider In This Scenario: Analyst Seeing as the current market condition is still mostly uncertain, Darkfost offers two ways to engage the current scenario. First, the analyst states that investors could begin increasing exposure gradually, and in line with the ratio’s movement towards lower risk zones. Second, Darkfost explains that a market participant could decide to wait for clear improvements in the Sharpe Ratio before entering the market at all. This is to serve as a confirmation strategy for the purpose of investor safety. However, Darkfost notes that the present bear phase could last a couple more months before any true reversal is seen, regardless of the signal being flashed by the Sharpe Ratio. As of this writing, Bitcoin stands at a $69,064 valuation. CoinMarketCap data reflects a 1.71% loss over the past day.

Three major theories have emerged: leveraged hedge funds caught in a yen funding squeeze, banks forced to hedge structured Bitcoin products, and miners shifting capital toward artificial intelligence infrastructure. Rather than competing explanations, these forces may be interconnected. Hedge Funds, Structured Notes, and Forced Selling One leading theory centers on Hong Kong-based hedge funds that made leveraged bets on Bitcoin’s rise. According to Parker White, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Investment Officer at DeFi Development Corp, some funds used options tied to Bitcoin ETFs such as BlackRock’s IBIT while financing positions with low-cost Japanese yen borrowing. The strategy was straightforward. Funds borrowed yen, converted it into other currencies, and deployed capital into higher-risk assets like Bitcoin. As long as Bitcoin climbed and borrowing costs remained low, the trade worked. But when Bitcoin stalled and the yen strengthened, the dynamic reversed. Rising funding costs and falling crypto prices turned leverage into a liability. Margin calls followed, forcing rapid liquidation of Bitcoin positions and amplifying downside pressure. The Structured Product Effect Former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes suggested another possible trigger: bank hedging activity tied to structured notes linked to spot Bitcoin ETFs. These products allow clients to gain Bitcoin exposure with features such as principal protection or downside barriers. When Bitcoin breaks key price levels, such as $78,700 in one structured product tied to Morgan Stanley, dealers must delta-hedge by selling Bitcoin or futures. This creates a “negative gamma” effect. As price falls, more hedging is required, accelerating the decline. In this scenario, banks shift from liquidity providers to forced sellers, intensifying volatility. Miners Shift Toward AI as Hashrate Signals Flash A third theory links Bitcoin’s weakness to growing structural stress among miners. On February 7, analyst Judge Gibson wrote on X that increasing demand for AI-focused data centers is pushing some miners to reconsider their business models. The shift may already be contributing to a 10%-40% drop in hashrate in certain segments. In December 2025, Riot Platforms announced a broader data center strategy and sold $161 million worth of Bitcoin. Another miner, IREN, also revealed plans to expand into AI infrastructure. Meanwhile, the Hash Ribbons indicator flashed a warning. The 30-day average hashrate fell below the 60-day average, a negative inversion historically associated with miner stress and potential capitulation. As of February 7, the average electricity cost to mine one Bitcoin stood near $58,160, while total production costs were closer to $72,700. If Bitcoin trades below $60,000 for an extended period, profitability pressure could intensify, potentially forcing additional selling. A Systemic Chain Reaction From a systems-level perspective, these developments may not be isolated. Algorithmic trading systems can transmit localized shocks globally within seconds. Hedge fund liquidations can increase volatility, triggering structured product hedging. Falling prices then pressure miners, who may sell reserves or pivot capital elsewhere. Each step compounds the next. The May 2010 Flash Crash demonstrated how automated systems can turn contained stress into rapid market-wide dislocation. Today’s institutional Bitcoin market operates under similar algorithmic frameworks. Unlike the 2017-2021 cycle, which was largely retail-driven, the current market structure is heavily influenced by bank trading desks, derivatives exposure, and risk-managed strategies. The professionalization of Bitcoin has increased liquidity and access, but it has also introduced new systemic vulnerabilities. If historical patterns tied to long-term holder realized price repeat, some analysts suggest a potential 15% downside scenario toward the $34,500 zone. Whether that level is tested or not, the February 6 selloff highlights a critical reality: Bitcoin’s volatility is no longer just emotional, it is increasingly structural.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-02-08 12:01:16

This milestone moves the market closer to the 1 billion XRP target removed from circulation. Crypto analyst ChartNerd drew attention to this development, noting, “That 1 billion XRP locked and removed from the open market target doesn’t feel so far now.” The locked XRP represents tokens that are not available for trading. As more XRP enters these locked positions, the available supply decreases. Analysts and traders expect this reduction to support price stability and potential growth. BOOM! Total $XRP locked now sits at 780,000,000. That 1 billion XRP locked and removed from the open market target doesn't feel so far now, does it? https://t.co/fBpoOwtmE1 pic.twitter.com/Qtj4wdu61V — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) February 6, 2026 XRP ETFs and Supply Dynamics XRP ETFs are emerging as a key factor in supply management. Institutional funds buying XRP through these ETFs are effectively removing tokens from circulation. As ETF inflows increase , demand rises, and the liquid supply continues to tighten. The growth of XRP ETFs also introduces a structured path for institutional participation . Investors using these funds consistently buy XRP, which keeps a steady upward pressure on demand. ChartNerd’s observation reinforces this trend, showing the importance of locked tokens in shaping market activity. Impact on XRP Price Reducing the supply of XRP can significantly affect its market price. When fewer tokens are available for trading , existing holders gain greater control over market liquidity. This scarcity effect can help maintain upward momentum during periods of buying interest. The current total of 780 million locked XRP suggests a meaningful shift in the market’s balance between circulating supply and institutional holdings. As ETFs continue to expand, each additional purchase removes more XRP from the open market. This supply reduction has the potential to create a sustained price floor, benefiting holders and attracting further investment. Future Outlook Expectations for XRP focus on the continued growth of ETFs and the resulting locked supply. As the market moves closer to the 1 billion target, more tokens will be effectively removed from circulation. This process may support stronger price resilience. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Institutional interest remains a key driver. The combination of ETF adoption and locked XRP supply establishes a controlled mechanism for market absorption. Investors can expect that supply constraints will become increasingly relevant as ETF assets under management rise . With 780 million XRP now locked, attention turns to the final phase toward reaching the 1 billion token milestone. Each step closer emphasizes the rising institutional demand for XRP. The combination of active ETF inflows and reduced circulating supply presents a tremendous opportunity, as the impact on supply could push XRP’s price up.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced the new restrictions on February 6, 2026. The measures extend beyond traditional sectors such as energy and trade to include the digital economy. What Will Be Banned in the Crypto Sector? The new package is directed against crypto platforms, traders, and companies that, according to European regulators, are helping Russia circumvent existing sanctions. The aim is to close loopholes in digital payments and restrict cryptocurrency-based financing. While the exact wording of the measures remains unclear, the EU has indicated that it intends to strengthen oversight of how Russian users interact with crypto services. According to reports circulating on social network X, the proposed measures may include a ban on the Digital Ruble and additional restrictions on crypto services associated with Russia. Other sources suggest that platforms facilitating cryptocurrency trading for Russian users could face new limitations. Sanctions in Other Sectors In addition to crypto-related restrictions, the 20th sanctions package includes a complete ban on maritime services for Russian crude oil. The move is expected to reduce Russia's energy revenues and complicate oil supply logistics. An additional 43 vessels from the so-called “shadow fleet” will be subject to sanctions, bringing the total number of restricted ships to 640. In the trade sector, exports of goods and services to Russia worth more than €360 million are set to be banned, including rubber, tractors, and cybersecurity services. Simultaneously, import bans will be imposed on Russian metals, chemicals, and minerals worth over €570 million. In the financial sector, restrictions will apply to 20 regional Russian banks, as well as financial institutions in third countries suspected of facilitating sanctions evasion. Previous Crypto-Related Measures Cryptocurrency-related sanctions against Russia are not new for the EU. Previously introduced measures include: A prohibition on providing crypto-asset services and trust advisory services to Russian citizens Restrictions preventing Russian citizens and residents from owning, controlling, or holding positions in companies that provide crypto wallet, account, or custody services Sanctions against specific crypto service providers A reporting requirement for transfers exceeding €100,000 outside the EU involving Russian-owned or controlled entities The new package is expected to expand on these measures, with a stronger focus on crypto platforms and digital payments. Commentary From a technological perspective, sanctions targeting crypto platforms highlight the tension between centralized regulation and decentralized blockchain systems. Historically, increased regulatory pressure on centralized exchanges has coincided with growth in peer-to-peer (P2P) trading and over-the-counter (OTC) markets. Previous restrictions, such as China’s 2021 crypto ban, accelerated user migration toward decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. The effectiveness of the new sanctions may ultimately depend on how successfully regulators can enforce restrictions within an ecosystem designed to operate beyond traditional jurisdictional boundaries.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,COMMODITY|REGULATION|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-02-08 12:15:11

Crypto presales allow participants to purchase tokens before public exchange listings—often at discounted prices—offering higher upside potential but with elevated risk. This in-depth guide explains how crypto presales work, highlights the most promising projects, outlines risks, and provides a professional evaluation framework aligned with Google News and Google Search ranking standards. What Is a Crypto Presale? A crypto presale is an early fundraising phase where a blockchain project sells tokens to early supporters before launching on centralized or decentralized exchanges. These presales are typically used to fund development, marketing, liquidity provisioning, and ecosystem growth. Presale participants often receive tokens at lower prices or with bonus allocations compared to public buyers. However, returns depend on execution, adoption, and market conditions. Top Crypto Presale Projects Gaining Attention in 2026 Based on funding traction, community engagement, and utility positioning, the following crypto presales are currently attracting investor interest: 1. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) Sector: Bitcoin Layer-2 Scaling Blockchain: Solana Ecosystem Key Strength: High-throughput scaling solution for Bitcoin-based applications Presale Highlight: Over $30M raised with strong developer backing 2. Dogeball (DOGEBALL) Sector: Meme + GameFi Blockchain: Ethereum Key Strength: Community-driven model with play-to-earn mechanics Risk Level: High volatility typical of meme-based assets 3. SpyDoge (SPYD) Sector: Meme Token with Utility Blockchain: BNB Smart Chain / Ethereum Key Strength: Staking, NFTs, and expanding ecosystem roadmap Presale Performance: Over $1M raised during early rounds 4. IPO Genie Sector: DeFi & Tokenized Fundraising Blockchain: Ethereum Key Strength: Bridges traditional IPO concepts with decentralized finance Crypto Presale Comparison Table (2026) Project Sector Blockchain Presale Strength Risk Level Bitcoin Hyper Layer-2 Scaling Solana Strong Funding & Utility Medium Dogeball Meme / GameFi Ethereum High Community Engagement High SpyDoge Meme + Utility BSC / Ethereum Fast-Growing Presale High IPO Genie DeFi Fundraising Ethereum Innovative Use Case Medium How to Evaluate a Crypto Presale Before Investing 1. Team Transparency Projects with publicly verifiable teams, prior blockchain experience, and active communication channels carry lower execution risk. 2. Tokenomics A sustainable crypto presale includes clear supply allocation, vesting schedules, liquidity locks, and anti-dump mechanisms. 3. Utility & Demand Drivers Tokens should have clear use cases such as governance, payments, staking, gaming economies, or protocol fees. 4. Security & Compliance Smart-contract audits, KYC verification, and transparent legal disclosures improve long-term credibility and reduce regulatory exposure. Risks Associated With Crypto Presales High price volatility after exchange listings Liquidity limitations during early trading phases Project execution failure or delayed development Potential scams or rug pulls in unverified launches Crypto presales should be treated as high-risk investments and limited to a defined risk budget. Why Crypto Presales Still Matter in 2026 Despite market maturity, crypto presale remain attractive because they offer early exposure to innovation, discounted pricing, and community incentives. Many of today’s leading blockchain platforms originated from early presale funding rounds. Final Verdict The crypto presale landscape in 2026 continues to present opportunities for informed investors willing to conduct deep research and manage risk. By focusing on transparency, real-world utility, and sustainable tokenomics, investors can identify presales with long-term potential rather than short-term hype. As always, diversification and due diligence remain essential when participating in any crypto presale.

This incident occurred when too much Bitcoin was mistakenly allocated to user accounts . This announcement was made public when the exchange disclosed that it recovered 99.7% of the overpaid BTC the same day it noticed the problem. For the remaining 0.3%, which consists of roughly 1,788 Bitcoins, the company highlighted that it had already been sold. Therefore, to ensure that its clients’ balances were accurate, Bithumb covered the sold cryptocurrency with its funds. In a statement dated Sunday, February 8, the crypto exchange mentioned that, “Bithumb’s total holdings of all virtual assets, including Bitcoin (BTC), fully match or exceed user deposits.” Individuals raise safety concerns amid Bithumb’s promotional reward mistake The incident, which took place on February 6, 2026, erupted when Bithumb intended to award modest rewards — about 2,000 Korean won (roughly $1.40–$1.95) per user — during a promotional event. Instead, a system or input error credited about 2,000 BTC per eligible account, resulting in an erroneous allocation of about 620,000 BTC, valued at more than $40 billion–$60 billion at prevailing market prices. Bithumb explained that Bitcoin credited in excess was mostly acquired directly from user accounts, while the portion already liquidated in the market was reimbursed using Bithumb’s corporate reserves. Apart from this, reports noted that the South Korean exchange announced compensation measures under which those who actively used the platform at the time of the incident would be awarded 20,000 Korean won ($15) each. Moreover, those who traded their Bitcoin holdings at terrible prices at the time of the issues were promised to recover their full sale amount plus an additional 10%. The company also pledged to waive trading costs across all markets for 7 days, commencing on Monday, February 9. At this particular moment, reports reached out to the crypto exchange’s executives seeking answers to the problem’s root cause. In response to this request, the team stated that the incident was caused by a technical malfunction . This glitch occurred during a promotional event, leading to the distribution of an excessive amount of Bitcoin to some user accounts. Consequently, the exchange experienced rapid price fluctuations as these users quickly sold the cryptocurrency. To stop this activity, Bithumb swiftly restricted user access, particularly for the affected accounts. Afterwards, the exchange initiated efforts to stabilize trading activities. Within minutes, everything was sorted out, thereby preventing significant sell-offs. However, even after declaring the issue resolved, several individuals continued to raise concerns about the safety of their assets. To calm its clients, Bithumb asserted that the issue was not the result of hacking and assured them that no client’s assets were lost during the incident. Additionally, the platform noted that deposits and withdrawals continued as usual. Several crypto exchanges face technical issues, sparking concerns in the industry Recently, crypto exchanges operating under a centralized system have reported persistent operational issues. An example is Coinbase . In June, the online platform stressed that account limitations were a substantial problem. In attempts to solve this issue, the cryptocurrency exchange decided to reduce unnecessary account freezes by 82%. This was after it had announced enhancements to its infrastructure and machine-learning systems. This improvement followed increased complaints from users who could not access their accounts for months without any reported security issues. Another similar incident occurred during October’s market decline , when users on the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, faced technical challenges that led to significant losses for some traders amid peak volatility. Following this incident, the exchange allocated about $728 million in compensation to affected users, even though it claimed broader market conditions led to most sell-offs, even though its main trading system worked just fine.
