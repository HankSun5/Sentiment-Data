The cryptocurrency’s value fell by more than 30% over the week, crashing to as low as $1,850 on Friday, February 6. Amid the Ethereum market downturn, a significant development has emerged — one which could make or mar the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. Ethereum Breaches Realized Price Across All Investor Cohorts In a recent post on Quicktake, on-chain analyst MorenoDV shared a shocking development within the Ethereum network. The analyst highlighted that the Ethereum price recently slipped below the cost basis of multiple investor groups. The revelation is based on the Realized Price by Balance Cohorts metric, which monitors the average on-chain cost basis of Ethereum holders. The metric groups these investors by wallet size, showing where these cohorts are holding profitably or running at losses. In the chart above, we see the Ethereum price break beneath multiple cost bases (represented with yellow, green, blue, and purple lines). The most striking, however, is the loss of the realized price of the largest holders (with 100k ETH and above stored), which stands at around $2,074. Historically, the realized price of this investor class (with more than 100k ETH in holdings) has taken on dual roles for the Ethereum price, depending on its trajectory. According to data from 2019, mid-2020, and late 2022 price actions, whale realized price typically takes on a role of formidably resisting price during downtrends; during uptrends, it interestingly acts as reliable support. Hence, at periods where the Ethereum price stabs through the whale realized price to the downside, MorenoDV explained that two potential paths typically emerge. In his words: “either a violent snap-back rally as the level flips to support (2020, 2022), or further capitulation into multi-year lows (2018-2019).” Major ETH Price Levels To Watch Because the Ethereum price went through all investor cohorts’ realized prices at the same time, there is something worth noting here. MorenoDV pointed out that smaller holders collectively have their realized prices between the $2,534 – $2,675 range. Thus, should the Ethereum price attempt to recover previous legs, the $2,534–$2,675 price range will pose significant resistance to that effort. However, the aforementioned range is not the most critical one for the Ethereum price. The analyst highlighted the whale cohort’s realized price , which is approximately $2,074 — to be the most critical for the Ethereum price. Following previous extrapolations, a reclamation of this level would likely follow historical trends and push prices upwards, while failure to retake this level within a period of 30 – 45 days would precede significant drawdowns. In the event that the latter scenario holds true, the Ethereum price could swiftly fall to $1,800, or even lower. If price breaks beneath $1,800 and is sustained below this level, MorenoDV hypothesizes that this could lead Ethereum to the $1,600–$1,300 levels. As of this writing, Ethereum stands at a valuation of $2,030, reflecting an over 7% jump in the past 24 hours.",Ethereum|ETH|ethereum price|ETHUSDT,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-02-07 20:30:42

The signal emerges after prolonged selling pressure that has gradually diminished over recent weeks. The cryptocurrency has declined steadily since its September peak. Recent price action displays shorter candle bodies and reduced momentum, indicating possible seller fatigue. However, technical analysts warn that this development does not signal a trend reversal. At press time, DOGE trades near $0.09835 following a 0.08% decline in the past 24 hours. This bounce reflects a reaction to established support levels rather than a fundamental change in market structure. Price Remains Trapped Within Descending Channel The asset continues moving within a descending regression channel that has governed price action for several months. This pattern limits upside potential while providing structural boundaries for trading activity. Support currently holds at $0.080, a zone where previous selloffs lost momentum. This level represents critical defense for bulls attempting to prevent further deterioration. Above current levels, resistance sits at $0.117. This threshold has rejected multiple recovery attempts since November. Traders view this level as essential for any sustainable reversal. Breaking above it could open the path toward $0.153, which aligns with the channel's upper boundary and previous distribution zones. The TD Sequential indicator operates as a momentum tool that identifies potential exhaustion points. While useful for timing entries, it does not override prevailing trend direction. The signal suggests reduced selling intensity rather than imminent bullish control. On-Chain Metrics Point to Accumulation Behavior Spot Taker Cumulative Volume Delta remains positive despite extended price weakness. Aggressive buy orders continue exceeding sell orders, demonstrating persistent demand at lower price levels. This metric reveals market participants are absorbing available supply rather than liquidating positions. The pattern contrasts sharply with panic selling episodes where CVD typically turns sharply negative. Buyers are not aggressively pushing prices higher. Instead, they enter positions methodically as sellers reduce activity. This dynamic supports the notion of quiet accumulation through absorption rather than speculative enthusiasm. Exchange netflow data reinforces this narrative. DOGE recorded approximately $7.7 million in outflows recently. Tokens leaving exchanges during weakness suggests holders are moving assets to cold storage rather than preparing for distribution. Reduced exchange supply limits immediate selling pressure. However, these flows do not confirm aggressive institutional accumulation. They simply indicate diminished willingness to sell into current price levels. Combined with positive CVD readings, these conditions reduce the probability of forced liquidation cascades. Absent new catalytic selling events, downside acceleration appears less likely from current levels. Open Interest rose over 5% to approximately $1.04 billion while price remains compressed. This increase indicates traders are adding leveraged positions near support rather than closing exposure. Rising OI without a directional breakout typically amplifies volatility risk. Both long and short positions appear active, suggesting market participants anticipate significant movement. The current positioning creates elevated liquidation sensitivity. A decisive break above resistance or below support could trigger rapid, leverage-driven price expansion in either direction. Funding rates remain near neutral, suggesting a balance between bulls and bears. Neither side has established clear dominance, contributing to range-bound conditions.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,DOGE|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-02-07 20:45:53

Many are moving away from older, slow-moving projects and focusing instead on new crypto protocols with real use and easy-to-understand technology. Practical development is starting to matter more than past reputation. One story gaining attention centers on a new crypto decentralized finance project preparing for a broader public launch. Analysts suggest it could outperform much of the market as adoption grows. The interest is not driven by hype alone. The project is building a strong technical base for long-term use. What is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)? Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a fresh platform being developed to change how crypto lending and borrowing works. It aims to let users keep their assets while still accessing liquidity. Instead of selling tokens, users can supply them to earn yield or use them as collateral to borrow. The protocol is planned around two models, Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). The P2C model is intended to use shared liquidity pools with automated rates, while the P2P model is designed to allow users to agree on custom terms directly. Both models are still under development as the platform continues to roll out. This project has already gotten extremely successful in its initial presale phases. It has a value of over $20.4 million raised and above 19,000 holders. At this point, the project is at Phase 7 of its distribution. The token is valued at $0.04 which is a 300% improvement of the initial value. The window of early entry is rapidly closing with the official launch price being pegged at$ 0.06. V1 Protocol Professional Security and Launch This new release of the V1 protocol into the Sepolia testnet is one of the largest sources of the hype. It is an open source development of the platform on which the user can test the features on a live platform. The ability to see a functional product prior to the launch of the mainnet is a big indicator of advancement. Another priority of the team is security. The protocol was able to complete a deep audit by Halborn , a global leader in blockchain safety. It has also achieved high rating at CertiK, and has a bug bounty of $50,000. Due to this technical preparedness, analysts report a first price target of $0.12. As the protocol would switch to the mainnet, many investors believe MUTM would be increased 300% as the current level. Growth Drivers The key part of the system is the mtToken. When you lend assets, you receive these tokens as a receipt for your deposit. They are yield-bearing, which means they increase in value over time as borrowers repay interest. The project also supports the MUTM token through a buy-and-distribute model. A portion of the fees generated by lending activity is planned to be used to buy back tokens from the market. These tokens are then returned to the community. To keep participants engaged, the platform includes a 24-hour leaderboard. Each day, the most active contributor can receive a $500 bonus, adding an extra incentive for ongoing participation. Analysts have a second price forecast of $0.28 based on these demand drivers. It would be a great addition since more individuals would lock their tokens to get rewards. The $1.00 Path Mutuum Finance has a very ambitious roadmap. The group intends to roll out its own overcollateralized stablecoin. This will make the process of borrowing even easier and stable to the users. They are also transiting to Layer-2 networks in order to make transactions faster and significantly cheaper. The strategies are necessary in achieving a global market. Analysts estimate that these moves may take the price to a third target of $0.45 which would be a more than 1,000% improvement on the starting price. Others even project to the level of the $1.00 mark by 2027 in the event the protocol turns into a standard in the DeFi world. Phase 7 is selling out fast and coining an increased demand in the project. Recent reports indicate a number of whale distributions, and the big investors make huge capital investments into the project. The fact that whales come at this point is a big indicator that there is a lot of confidence in the launch. This is an essential fact since the 50% discount in comparison with the launch price, which is $0.06 will not be lasting. The demand to enlist is peaking as the supply of $0.04 is almost eliminated. The next big crypto step on the list of what many would consider to be a path towards the summit of the market is the transition of the testnet to the official mainnet.

In the United States, lawmakers and regulators now focus intensely on how clear digital-asset rules could shape the future of cryptocurrency adoption . This growing urgency has captured investor attention, especially among those who believe regulation could unlock the next major phase of institutional participation. Lord XRP spotlighted this momentum after sharing footage from a February 2026 congressional discussion that emphasized the need for firm legislative structure in the crypto sector. His post reflects a broader conversation in Washington surrounding the proposed Digital Asset Market Clarity Act , a bill designed to define oversight, reduce uncertainty, and create consistent operating standards for blockchain-based assets. BREAKING CLARITY ACT INCOMING. LETS SEND #XRP TO THE MOON!! pic.twitter.com/OqtXkRdcAe — Lord XRP (@Bitforcoinz) February 7, 2026 The Rising Demand for Clear Crypto Rules U.S. policymakers increasingly agree that digital-asset markets cannot mature without transparent regulation. Legislators aim to establish defined responsibilities for regulators, clarify how different tokens receive classification, and provide safeguards that protect investors while allowing innovation to continue. Supporters believe structured rules would encourage responsible growth and prevent the confusion that has slowed adoption in previous years. This push for clarity also reflects global competition. Countries with friendlier crypto frameworks already attract investment and talent, which increases pressure on U.S. lawmakers to act quickly. As a result, regulatory certainty has shifted from a theoretical goal to an immediate political priority. Political Signals and Industry Friction Recent congressional testimony reinforced the urgency of passing comprehensive legislation. Officials warned that the market cannot progress safely without clear rules and suggested that jurisdictions with established crypto frameworks could attract participants if the United States delays action. These strong statements highlight how seriously policymakers now treat digital-asset regulation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 At the same time, disagreements within the crypto industry reveal the complexity of reform. Companies, exchanges, and advocacy groups continue to debate how rules should apply to stablecoins, trading platforms, and decentralized finance. These tensions slow the legislative process, yet they also show how significant the outcome could become for the entire sector. Why XRP Stands at the Center of Attention Regulatory clarity holds special importance for XRP because past legal uncertainty shaped investor perception of the asset. Clear market-structure laws could remove lingering doubts and make it easier for financial institutions to explore blockchain-based payment solutions connected to the XRP ecosystem. Greater certainty often encourages long-term capital, which can influence both adoption and market sentiment. Supporters now interpret the legislative push as a potential turning point . They argue that regulation could transform from a barrier into a catalyst for mainstream integration. Whether this shift ultimately drives dramatic price movement remains unknown, but policy direction now plays a decisive role in shaping expectations. For XRP holders and the broader crypto community, the message feels clear. The next major market chapter may depend less on speculation and more on the rules that define how the industry operates.

The move follows an announcement by prosecutors in Istanbul confirming the seizure of approximately €460 million in assets linked to Veysel Sahin, who is accused of running unlawful online gambling platforms. While officials initially declined to identify the crypto issuer involved, Tether later confirmed it had blocked the funds tied to the investigation at the request of authorities. Tether Confirms Cooperation With Law Enforcement Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said the company acted after reviewing information supplied by law enforcement agencies, stressing that compliance with local and international laws remains a core part of its operations. “Law enforcement came to us, they provided some information, we looked at the information and we acted in respect of the laws of the country,” Ardoino reportedly said. “And that’s what we do when we work with the DOJ, when we work with the FBI, you name it,” he added, highlighting the firm’s broader cooperation with regulators worldwide. Growing Crackdown On Underground Finance The Turkish investigation forms part of a wider effort to dismantle underground gambling and payment networks, with authorities reporting more than $1 billion in assets seized through related probes. Analysts note that stablecoins are increasingly being scrutinised due to their use in cross-border transactions that can bypass traditional banking oversight mechanisms. Stablecoin Blacklisting On The Rise Blockchain analytics firm Elliptic has reported that stablecoin issuers, primarily Tether and Circle, had blacklisted roughly 5,700 wallets by late 2025. Those frozen wallets were estimated to contain around $2.5 billion, with approximately three-quarters holding USDT at the time restrictions were imposed. Tether has stated that it has assisted in more than 1,800 investigations across 62 countries, resulting in $3.4 billion in frozen USDT linked to alleged criminal activity. Market Growth Continues Despite Scrutiny Despite ongoing regulatory pressure, USDT continues to grow rapidly, reaching a record market capitalisation of $187.3 billion during the fourth quarter of 2025.

Companies like Tesla, meanwhile, are still expecting improved access to India’s expanding market because electric vehicles are not covered by the pact. The agreement has significant implications for high-end American automobiles. India will reduce taxes on gasoline-powered vehicles with displacements of more than 3,000cc. Buyers currently pay up to 110 percent in duties. Over the next ten years, those taxes will be reduced to 30 percent under the new accord. All import taxes will be eliminated for Harley-Davidson motorbikes. A $500 billion commitment for closer ties President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi worked together to hammer out the agreement. The agreement functions as a commercial agreement between the two nations. The present 50 percent tariff on goods originating from India will be reduced to 18 percent in the United States. In exchange, India has pledged to purchase $500 billion worth of American goods. India also consented to reduce its oil purchases from Russia. India’s commitment to forging closer connections with the United States is demonstrated by the $500 billion pledge. India is prepared to spend more for strategic and political reasons as a result of the switch from cheaper Russian oil to more costly American energy. Electric vehicles shut out of agreement The most surprising part of the deal is what got left out. Electric vehicles will not get lower taxes, even though Tesla’s Elon Musk has spent years asking Indian officials to reduce import duties. He has argued that the high taxes make his cars too expensive for Indian customers. By keeping EVs out of this trade deal, Indian leaders made their position clear. Foreign electric car companies will only get special treatment if they build factories in India. The government appears to be protecting India’s own electric vehicle industry. The Union Budget for 2026-27 showed this strategy clearly. The budget removed import taxes on 35 different types of machinery used to make lithium-ion batteries. It also provided tax breaks for equipment that processes important minerals needed for batteries. A senior official from the Ministry of Heavy Industries explained the reasoning behind the decision. “The goal is not just to import technology, but to build the ‘ore-to-magnet’ value chain within our borders,” the official stated. By keeping taxes high on finished electric cars but making it cheaper to buy factory equipment, India is pushing global companies to choose between paying heavy duties or building local factories. Compared to another trade pact India recently worked on, the American arrangement appears to be different. India made better conditions in negotiations with the European Union. Deeper tax cuts, down to 10 percent, were negotiated with the EU and extended to more vehicle categories. Those discussions also covered several electric models. Former trade negotiator Rajesh Agrawal drew attention to the distinction between the two agreements. “This framework demonstrates that India is willing to be flexible on traditional sectors, but will not compromise on the future of mobility,” he stated. “The U.S. deal is a pragmatic trade-off: American engines for Indian textiles and chips.” The comparison demonstrates how India’s approach to trade negotiations varies according to the partner. The goal of the EU accord was to link industries in a variety of sectors. The US agreement focuses more on energy security and cooperation to counter certain foreign economic practices. Soon after both nations sign the final documents in March 2026, the new tariff rates will go into force. American automakers Ford and General Motors now have a new chance to sell high-end cars in India, a market that has proven challenging to access due to strong protectionist regulations. Indian customers will likely notice the changes quickly. Powerful sports cars and expensive motorcycles from America will become more affordable. However, the country’s push for cleaner transportation remains focused on vehicles made inside India. The agreement favors traditional gasoline-powered vehicles while keeping the door closed on imported electric cars. This creates an odd situation where high-emission luxury vehicles become cheaper while the move toward cleaner technology depends on meeting local manufacturing requirements.

Whale Alert, a blockchain tracking service, identified a transfer of 203,556,622 DOGE tokens, valued at approximately $20 million, from an unidentified wallet to Robinhood's platform within the past day. The transaction represents one of several large-scale movements recently observed in the Dogecoin network. Just days earlier, on February 4, another substantial transfer occurred when 277,731,894 DOGE worth $29.5 million moved from an unknown source to the same exchange platform. These transfers come as Dogecoin experienced a notable price recovery, gaining nearly 0.04% in value over the last 24 hours to trade at around $0.09855 at the time of writing . The rebound marks a reversal from the downward pressure that characterized trading earlier this week. Market Volatility Grips Cryptocurrency Sector The broader cryptocurrency market has struggled to regain stability following a severe October sell-off that eroded investor confidence. Major digital assets have faced sustained selling pressure as market participants continue to exit positions. This week brought intensified volatility across the crypto space. Leveraged positions unwound rapidly, creating cascading effects throughout the market. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other leading cryptocurrencies recorded significant declines as traders reduced exposure to risk-oriented assets. The timing of these whale transfers coincides with broader market turbulence. Investors have shown increasing caution, rotating capital away from speculative investments toward safer havens.

According to data, the cryptocurrency market has seen $1 trillion worth of capital flow out since mid-January. With no doubt about the emergence of the bear season, investors are now approaching the market with greater skepticism and caution. One of the on-chain metrics highlighting this shift in behavior is the Bitcoin taker buy ratio, which has fallen to new lows. BTC Taker Buy Ratio Drops To 0.48 In a new Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, market analyst CryptoOnchain shared a fresh on-chain angle to the ongoing selling pressure in the Bitcoin market. This observation is based on the declining Taker Buy Ratio on Binance, the world’s largest centralized exchange by trading volume. Related Reading: Why The Market Cap Argument For XRP Price Not Reaching $10,000 Is ‘Flawed’ The Bitcoin Taker Buy Ratio is a sentiment indicator that estimates the proportion of trading volume owned by buyers against that of the sellers. Typically, values below 1 signal that taker sell volumes (aggressive selling) are outpacing taker buy volumes, which implies that sellers are overwhelming the buyers in the market. Highlighting data from CryptoQuant, CryptoOnchain revealed that the Bitcoin Taker Buy Ratio (14-day Moving Average) on Binance has dropped to 0.48, marking its lowest level since October 2025. Such a negative market sentiment on the world’s largest exchange spotlights a worrying trend in the general derivatives market. CryptoOnchain said: A drop to such a significant low suggests that sellers are overwhelmingly dominating the order book, aggressively hitting bids without sufficient buying resistance. As the crypto pundit also pointed out, this drop in the Bitcoin Taker Buy Ratio coincided with the recent price correction, which saw the premier cryptocurrency fall to around $61,000. CryptoOnchain noted that this metric needs to stabilize and begin to rise again if the BTC price is to see any relief. The Quicktake post concluded: For a potential reversal or a local bottom, we need to see this metric stabilize and begin to trend upwards, indicating that aggressive selling is exhausted and buyers are stepping back in. Until then, caution is advised as the momentum remains heavily in favor of the bears. Bitcoin Price At A Glance After one of the largest “red” days in the crypto market, the price of BTC appears to be recovering nicely, having returned above the $70,000 on Friday. As of this writing, the flagship cryptocurrency is valued at around $70,263, reflecting an over 11% price jump in the past 24 hours.

Instead, it’ll be about the 13F filings that are expected to be due on the same date, and people will be looking for answers as to how the October 10 crash happened. Technically, while 13F filings are due 45 days after the end of the calendar year, that date this year falls on a Saturday. Then, there’s another federal holiday (Presidents’ Day) on Monday, February 16. Hence, the SEC deadline automatically rolls over to the next business day, which is February 17. The 13F filings and why they are trending As the world inches closer to Valentine’s Day, anticipation of the Form 13F filings has continued to rise, with users on X speculating that it could reveal the cause of the October 10 crash. Form 13F filings are mandatory SEC disclosures, and they concern institutional investment managers with over $100 million in US equity AUM. They disclose long positions in stocks/ETFs quarterly, and are usually filed within 45 days of a quarter ending. The filings for Q4 2025 are expected to drop on February 14, 2026, Valentine’s Day, and according to speculation on X, many expect the filings could reveal if a major institutional player had massive exposure to BTC via spot ETFs or related equities and was liquidated heavily around October 10 or in the aftermath. The filings could reveal a smoking gun in the form of an unexplained disappearance of large holdings, sharp reductions in ETF positions, or even anomalies in filings from HK-based or other filers with outsized crypto allocations. With this, people could more accurately infer who got wrecked in the crash, especially if there were any TradFi players involved. While the filings are highly anticipated, it is not confirmed that they will be able to provide a definitive explanation for the crash. However, TradFi positions are opaque enough to fuel the theory that the Valentine’s Day filings might narrow down the present suspects or show structural shifts. Speculation on who or what caused the crash On October 10, the crypto industry endured what many are now calling its largest single-day liquidation event. It saw over $19 billion in leveraged positions forcibly closed within roughly 24 hours, and BTC dropped sharply while many altcoins plunged even harder. The cascade effect was extreme, and even now, months later, the industry is still talking about it. Initially, the crash was linked to macro/geopolitical factors. However, it has become apparent that the crypto sector suffered the most. It did not help matters that industry leaders like OKX’s CEO pointed accusatory fingers at Binance , blaming their handling of risky asset positions. Wintermute’s CEO, Evgeny Gaevoy, has expressed skepticism that the crash from October 10 had anything to do with an exchange or market maker blowing up. “Maybe somebody blew up but there are simply no spillover effects for us to care,” Gaevoy wrote on X. “When 3AC blew up post terra everyone knew fairly soon because it spread via DMs. Sure it was shock and disbelief at first but it lasted maybe 2-3 days all in all.” Gaevoy also talked about how the situation was similar to FTX. According to them, it took longer for people to know, but it apparently also became very obvious when it was revealed they were in talks with Binance. “You don’t talk about bailouts/investments unless there is something very wrong,” Gaevoy wrote. Franklin Bi, a general partner at Pantera Capital, speculated that the crash can be linked to “someone large outside of crypto, likely based in Asia, with very few crypto-native counterparties.” He claimed this is “why no one has sniffed them out on CT.” In response to that train of thought, Gaevoy wrote , “Who would give 90 day conditions on somebody blowing up is what is unclear to me here.” A user named TheOtherParker on X echoed Franklin Bi’s sentiment about it being somebody large outside crypto that is also likely based in Asia, who was wrecked. “As @FranklinBi pointed out, the fund(s) being non-crypto would explain why no one sniffed them out. They would likely have few/no crypto counterparties, meaning complete isolation from CT,” TheOtherParker wrote. “Unfortunately, if a fund had their IBIT position liquidated today, they wouldn’t have to disclose the position change until 45 days after the quarter end, so we’d be looking at mid May for the smoking gun from 13F filings most likely,” they added . Some of the most plausible sounding analogies point to “a large non-crypto entity likely based in HK.” However, the caveat remains that all of these are mostly speculation. The filings due on February 14 and dropping on the 17th will provide answers… If there are any.

In a new report, crypto communications firm Chainstory analyzed 2,893 crypto press releases published between June 16 and November 1, 2025, and found that roughly 62% were issued by projects classified as either High Risk or confirmed Scams, based on indicators such as anonymous teams, unrealistic return claims, and cross-referencing with legal and consumer scam databases. Low-Impact Updates Crypto-specific press release “wires” operate on a pay-to-play model that allows projects to buy guaranteed placement across partner media sites, and, in the process, bypass traditional editorial judgment. Unlike legacy wire services that distribute releases for journalists to evaluate, many crypto wires sell direct publication to audiences with minimal compliance checks. This effectively turns article placement into a paid commodity. Chainstory said that any crypto project with sufficient budget can secure visibility on recognizable news domains regardless of credibility. The analysis revealed that most wire content consists of low-impact announcements that would typically be ignored by newsroom editors. Nearly half of all releases, or 49%, focused on routine product or feature updates, while another 24% covered exchange listings and trading promotions. Token launches and tokenomics changes accounted for 14% of releases. On the other hand, only 58 releases, approximately 2% of the dataset, related to traditionally newsworthy events such as venture funding rounds, mergers and acquisitions, or major corporate finance activity. Promotional Hype Dominates Crypto Wire Chainstory also examined tone and language, finding that promotional framing dominates crypto press releases. Only around 10% were written in a neutral, factual style, while approximately 54% were categorized as “overstated” and another 19% as overtly promotional. The report observed that superlative-heavy language common in marketing copy remains unchallenged in paid releases, even when similar claims would be edited or questioned in reported journalism. Risk profiling of issuers revealed a heavy skew toward questionable projects. High-risk issuers accounted for 35.6% of all releases, while confirmed scams made up 26.9%. Low-risk, established projects were responsible for only about 27% of press releases, which indicates that more credible firms rely less on paid distribution and are more likely to receive organic coverage. In sectors such as cloud mining, almost 90% of press releases came from projects flagged as high risk or scams.

Internet Computer protocol price forecast for 2029 expects the token to reach a peak price of $12.20. By 2032, the price of Internet Computer might reach a maximum of $19.21. Internet Computer (ICP) is a groundbreaking blockchain network developed by the DFINITY Foundation. It aims to extend the functionality of the internet, enabling it to host backend software and transforming it into a global, decentralized computer. Internet computer blockchain incorporates advanced cryptography and innovative technology to provide scalable, efficient, and secure decentralized applications (dApps). Given its robust technology and expanding utility, the Internet Computer blockchain’s future price prospects look promising. As more developers build on the platform and adoption increases, ICP token demand will likely rise. Does Internet Computer coin have a future? How much will Internet Computer coin cost in 2026? Will ICP reach $1000? Let’s get into the current price analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Internet Computer Token ICP Price $2.51 Market Cap $1.367B Trading Volume $78.66M Circulating Supply 548.03M ICP All-time High $750.73 (May 10, 2021) All-time Low $2.23 (Oct 10, 2025) 24-h High $2.55 24-h Low $2.40 Internet Computer Network technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day period) 15.61% (Very High) 14-Day RSI 36.92 (Neutral) 50-Day SMA $3.29 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 6 (Extreme Fear) Green Days 8/30 (27%) 200-Day SMA $4.26 Internet Computer price analysis TL;DR Breakdown ICP is down ~30% from recent highs and still technically bearish. The daily momentum remains negative despite oversold relief. The 4-hour chart shows stabilization, not a confirmed reversal. ICP 1-day price analysis ICP is trading around $2.50, marginally down 0.1% on the day (February 7), but the bigger picture remains heavy after sliding from the January high near $3.60, a drop of roughly 30%. The coin is trading well below the daily mid Bollinger Band (~$3.07) and recently tagged the lower band near $2.15, signaling strong bearish control rather than a completed reset. ICPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The RSI sits near 35, still below neutral and only modestly off oversold, while MACD remains deeply negative with no bullish crossover, confirming downside momentum is slowing but not reversed. As long as ICP stays below $2.80–$3.00, daily structure favors continuation or sideways basing at best. ICP 4-hour price analysis On the 4-hour timeframe, ICP is attempting to stabilize around $2.51, up about 0.4% on the session after bouncing from the $2.20–$2.30 demand zone. Price is compressing beneath the descending Alligator averages, with immediate resistance clustered at $2.55–$2.60, keeping rallies capped. ICPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView OBV has started to curl higher, suggesting mild accumulation, while CMF remains slightly negative, showing capital inflows are tentative rather than confident. Momentum is no longer accelerating downward, but without a clean break above $2.60, this move still reads as consolidation within a bearish trend. ICP technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 2.79 SELL SMA 5 $ 2.67 SELL SMA 10 $ 2.72 SELL SMA 21 $ 3.16 SELL SMA 50 $ 3.29 SELL SMA 100 $ 3.86 SELL SMA 200 $ 4.26 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 3.13 SELL EMA 5 $ 3.21 SELL EMA 10 $ 3.21 SELL EMA 21 $ 3.20 SELL EMA 50 $ 3.46 SELL EMA 100 $ 3.84 SELL EMA 200 $ 4.44 SELL What to expect from ICP price analysis If $2.20 holds, ICP may range between $2.30–$2.60 before the next decisive move, but failure to reclaim $2.80 and above keeps downside risk alive, while a daily close above $3.00 is needed to shift the broader bias bullish. Is Internet Computer a good investment? The Internet Computer (ICP) has shown significant potential and volatility since its launch, which is common for relatively new and ambitious blockchain projects. Its technology aims to decentralize the internet and bring smart contract functionality to the web, which could have wide-ranging implications for the future of web speed. However, the market performance of ICP has been highly volatile, and its success depends heavily on the adoption of its technology and the broader market environment for cryptocurrencies. Please note that before you make an investment decision, seek independent professional consultation. Will Internet Computer reach $25? Yes, Internet Computer ICP might reach and surpass $25 after 2032. Will Internet Computer reach $50? Yes, Internet Computer is expected to reach $50. Though the current internet computer sentiment is sideways, future price movements and market cap are expected to be positive. Will ICP reach $1000? Although its ATH sits at $750.73, attaining $1000 in the foreseeable future might be impossible. ICP is down 99% from its ATH and will require a massive turnaround in market fortunes to recapture previous highs. However, current price levels provide a good buying opportunity. Where can I buy Internet Computer? You can buy Internet Computer on the crypto market via Binance, Bybit, Coinbase Exchange, OKX, KuCoin, and more . Does Internet Computer have a good long-term future? Yes, the Internet Computer coin shows a promising long-term future.

As global commerce becomes faster, more digital, and more interconnected, the limitations of legacy messaging-based systems are becoming increasingly visible. This has brought renewed attention to XRP and Ripple’s payment infrastructure that aims to enable near-instant, low-cost settlement of value. From Bank Messaging To Real-Time Settlement Rails A massive 1.5 quadrillion financial shift is quietly unfolding, and it’s already shaking the foundations of global banking. Crypto analyst Archie has mentioned on X that SWIFT, the decades-old backbone of cross-border payments, is copying Ripple’s playbook for a real-time transfer system and testing the XRP Ledger integration that could flip the script on slow, outdated cross-border payments . Meanwhile, analysts are suggesting that if XRP captures even a fraction of SWIFT’s estimated $150 trillion annual flow by 2030, the upside could be enormous, while some stated that the altcoin might surge to $3,000+. With Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin integrating directly into core banking and treasury platforms, the bridge between crypto rails and fiat liquidity is rapidly taking shape. Currently, there’s a speculation that XRP is being reviewed as a full SWIFT replacement in the US document, and trillions are flowing into the XRP Ledger. Meanwhile, banks like Citi are tokenizing, and Ripple technology is capable of leading the charge. Archie believes that Citi is already somewhere running on Ripple technology. How The Last Major XRP Breakout Took Shape A side-by-side comparison chart of XRP’s historical and current market cycles suggests that history may be rhyming once again. Analyst Archie has also pointed out that in the 2016 to 2018 cycle, the price started trading at a low level around $0.003, gradually building along a rising trendline, then dipping in the orange box, before the price exploded to highs near $3.50. During that period, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) formed a clear low around the 50 level, signaling a momentum reset rather than a breakdown. The current 2025 to 2027 cycle is showing a structurally similar pattern. XRP is consolidating around the dollar mark, following a similar trend line, with a dip marked in an orange box to $0.70, and the formed bottom closer to the 40 mark. Archie noted that the patterns in price action, the dips, and the indicator signals across cycles are repeating almost identically. While history never repeats perfectly, these recurring fractal patterns suggest that XRP may be priming for an epic bull run phase, from fractions to dollars, now potentially from dollars to triple digits, like the projected $117 range. Archie is bullish because the riddlers were right all along, and believes Phoenix will rise.",XRP|Archie|Citi Bank|relative strength index|ripple|RLUSD|RSI|SWIFT|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-02-07 22:00:04

The price increase will take the value of the HINU token from $0.00026331 to $0.00026431. The project’s pre-launch phase began on April 1, 2025, following the conclusion of the presale. Husky Inu AI (HINU) Ready For $0.00026431 Husky Inu AI (HINU) is gearing up for the next price increase of its pre-launch phase. The price increase will take the value of the HINU token from $0.00026331 to $0.00026431. The regular increases in the value of the HINU token enable the project to continue fundraising while empowering its growing community and existing token holders. The primary goal of the pre-launch phase is to secure capital, fund platform improvements, undertake market initiatives, and support broader ecosystem expansion. The project’s official launch is on March 27, 2026. However, the team is open to moving the launch to an earlier or later date. The project team will conduct a series of review meetings to determine the project’s launch date. The first two review meetings were held on July 1, 2025, and October 1, 2025, while the third is scheduled for January 1, 2026. Fundraising has seen a substantial uptick over the past few weeks, after overcoming a significant slowdown. Husky Inu AI has raised $934,630 so far, and could cross $1 million before its official launch. Bitcoin (BTC) Reclaims $70,000 As Market Rebounds The cryptocurrency market made a strong rebound on Friday as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and other tokens bounced to reclaim key levels. The flagship cryptocurrency briefly lost the $60,000 mark on Thursday, resulting in the liquidation of $1.1 billion in BTC longs. Investors began accumulating again at lower levels as Bitcoin finally saw a dip buying in force. Binance’s Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU), an insurance fund established by Binance, bought 3,600 BTC worth $250 million, for $65,000 per coin. The purchase comes after Binance’s recent announcement stating that it plans to convert $1 billion SAFU reserves into Bitcoin over the next 30 days. Several crypto hedge funds have also begun buying the dip. According to Bitwise Head of Research, Andre Dragosch, the aggregate market beta across all global crypto hedge funds hit its highest level in two years as BTC weakened. “Looks like Crypto Hedge Funds are 'buying the dip'. Aggregate market beta across all global crypto hedge funds has increased to the highest level in 2 years. Signals increasing BTC market exposure by crypto hedge funds.” BTC rebounded late on Friday, briefly crossing $71,000 to $71,605. However, it failed to push higher and slipped to $67,629. The flagship cryptocurrency rose over 4% in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) reclaimed the $2,000 mark and is currently trading around $2,009, up nearly 6%. Ripple (XRP) rallied almost 9% over the past 24 hours, trading around $1.41. Solana (SOL) rebounded and reached $89.50 before losing momentum and dropping to $85. Dogecoin (DOGE) is up nearly 6% while Cardano (ADA) is up over 6% at $0.269. Chainlink (LINK), Litecoin (LTC), Hedera (HBAR), Stellar (XLM), Toncoin (TON), and Polkadot (DOT) also recorded a strong recovery over the past 24 hours.

While the early days of meme coins produced some rapid success stories, the market looks very different now. Many investors who held popular dog-themed tokens are facing a tougher reality as enthusiasm fades. The attention that once came purely from hype is no longer enough, and users are starting to demand real purpose. At the same time, a new generation of crypto protocols is beginning to take shape. These projects are not built around social media trends. Instead, they focus on creating practical financial tools with long-term value. This steady shift of capital away from hype-driven assets and toward functional systems is becoming one of the defining stories of 2026. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading at an estimated $0.000006, and the drop in its worth appears to be brutal, having fallen more than 60% since a historic peak in 2021. The token is failing to see a reason to climb even after its huge brand name and market cap worth almost $3.5 billion. Gone are the childhood days of vertical rallies. The SHIB technical charts indicate that the levels of resistance are high at the $0.000010 and $0.000012 levels. These sections are full of vendors who are seeking to break even in years of holding. Analysts are making pessimistic price forecasts in the remaining part of the year. According to some professionals, SHIB might fall another 20% to $0.000004 in the case of the current support being lost. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) The crypto protocol now drawing attention from former meme coin investors is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . It is a decentralized platform in development that focuses on non-custodial lending and borrowing. The goal is to let users earn interest on their crypto or access liquidity without selling their long-term holdings. The project has already raised over $20.43 million and attracted more than 19,000 holders, showing steady community growth. Mutuum Finance is currently in Phase 7 of its distribution, with the token priced at $0.04. This reflects roughly 300% growth from early phases, while still sitting below the stated launch price of $0.06, which many analysts see as leaving room for further upside if development milestones continue to be met. Why MUTM May outperform SHIB First, the size of the market capital is a massive determinant in returns in the future. Shiba Inu has an already existing market cap of $4 billion. SHIB requires an additional $4 billion new money to gain by half. This constrains its potential to a large extent. MUTM is on a far earlier level. Its market cap is low hence it takes a very small amount of capital to achieve huge percentage returns. It possesses the type of growth room that SHIB had in 2020. Second, there is a difference in utility. Shiba Inu is mostly a meme coin that is driven by hype. In its effort to add features, it has no fundamental financial reason. MUTM is built around utility. It uses mtTokens, which are designed to be interest-bearing assets that increase in value as interest is paid back through the system. These tokens are meant to represent a user’s share in supplied assets rather than act as simple placeholders. The project also outlines a buy-and-distribute model in its design. Under this plan, a portion of protocol fees is intended to be used to buy MUTM tokens from the market and redistribute them to the community. This approach is focused on linking token value to platform usage, rather than relying on short-term hype often seen with meme coins. Third, it is all about timing in crypto. The reason why many early SHIB investors are moving to MUTM is that they can see the momentum. Recently, Mutuum Finance just activated the V1 protocol on the testnet. This proves the tech is ready. Investors desire to be associated with a project that is only beginning to make its way instead of a project that has already reached its climax. The Last Window and the Security Demand is continuing to build as Phase 7 progresses, with many participants aiming to secure the $0.04 price before the planned $0.06 launch level. Interest has increased as availability tightens, which is common in later distribution stages. Security has also been a key focus for the project. Mutuum Finance has completed a full audit with Halborn and maintains a strong score from CertiK, adding confidence for cautious investors. To encourage participation, the platform runs a 24-hour leaderboard, where the top daily contributor can receive a $500 bonus. Easy entry options, including card payments, have lowered the barrier to join. As meme tokens like SHIB struggle to regain momentum, more investors are beginning to look toward utility-driven projects such as Mutuum Finance.

While confirmation is still pending, the structure has not been invalidated, keeping the upside scenario firmly on the table. With key resistance levels overhead and momentum beginning to stabilize, ETH may be entering a critical phase where the next major directional move starts to take shape. Weekly Libra Formation Keeps The Bullish Case Alive On the X platform, Kamile Uray highlighted that Ethereum is currently forming a Libra pattern on the weekly chart. With the weekly candle yet to close and no invalidation so far, the bullish formation remains active and continues to be a valid scenario. Related Reading: Ethereum Bulls Must Conquer $3,050 Or Momentum Quickly Fades According to the update, confirmation of a reversal would open the door for a move toward the $4,956 high, but the price may face notable resistance along the way, particularly around the $3,445 level. Kamile Uray noted that a daily close above $2,475 would serve as the first technical signal that upside momentum is strengthening and that the recovery could continue. Failure to sustain movement above this area could delay further progress and keep the price vulnerable to pullbacks. Since the Libra formation is developing on the weekly timeframe, the pattern would only be considered invalid if Ethereum breaks below the $1,388 low, underscoring the broader, long-term nature of the setup. Ethereum Stretches Higher At $2,086 After A Sharp 22% Run According to Can Özsüer, Ethereum is currently trading around $2,086, marking a strong rally from the $1,730 area. From that level to the current price, ETH has surged roughly 22% without a meaningful correction, which increases the likelihood of short-term profit-taking. After such a sharp move, light selling pressure typically emerges as the market cools off. Related Reading: Analyst Says You’re Not Bullish Enough On Ethereum – What Does He Mean? Can Özsüer notes that any selling from this region is expected to remain controlled rather than aggressive. The ideal pullback zone lies between $1,950 and $2,000, where the price could reset without damaging the broader bullish structure. A dip into this range would be considered healthy and could set the stage for the next leg higher. Once that corrective move plays out, the next upside objective comes in around the $2,200 level. However, if price pushes straight toward the target without offering a pullback, the strategy would need adjustment. In that scenario, chasing a long position becomes less attractive, as a stronger selling wave could follow once the target is reached. If a correction does materialize, Can Özsüer suggests that a long position on the pullback would be the preferred approach.

Optimism price prediction for 2029 suggests the token could reach a maximum value of $2.40. In 2032, OP tokens will range between $2.10 and $4.60, with an average value of $3.05. Optimism’s (OP) commitment to innovation is highlighted by its support for Layer-3 solutions. These solutions enable the development of decentralized applications (dApps) on top of Layer-2 chains, contributing to the expansive Optimism Superchain. The platform’s initiatives, including introducing custom gas tokens and Plasma mode aimed at reducing onboarding and operational costs, make it more accessible for new users and developers. As the market closely watches the price movements and growth trajectory of the token, can Optimism reach $10 soon? Let’s get into the OP price prediction for 2026 – 2032. Overview Cryptocurrency Optimism Token OP Price $0.1974 Market Cap $416.37M Trading Volume $85.22M Circulating Supply 2.116B OP All-time High $4.85 (Mar 06, 2024) All-time Low $0.2519 (Dec 26, 2025) 24-hour High $0.1997 24-hour Low $0.1887 Optimism price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 15.44% (Very High) 50-Day SMA $0.2924 14-Day RSI 30.36 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 6 (Extreme Fear) Green Days 10/30 (33%) 200-Day SMA $0.4805 Optimism price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: OP is oversold on the daily, increasing chances of a short-term bounce. The 4-hour structure shows consolidation, not confirmation of a reversal. Reclaiming $0.21–$0.22 is key; failure keeps downside risk toward $0.18. Optimism 1-day price chart OP opened the session around $0.1974 and is currently trading near $0.1971 as of February 7, reflecting continued hesitation after a heavy sell-off that has already shaved roughly 30% from the late-January peak near $0.28. Price remains well below the daily Bollinger mid-band near $0.263, keeping the broader structure decisively bearish, while the lower band around $0.174 acts as the next downside gravity zone if selling pressure resumes. OPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD remains deeply negative, confirming trend weakness, though the slowing histogram suggests downside momentum is losing intensity. RSI sits near 29, signaling deeply oversold conditions, which often precede short-lived relief bounces but do not yet imply a structural reversal. Optimism 4-hour price chart On the 4-hour timeframe, OP opened near $0.1969 and is currently trading around $0.1978, consolidating after a sharp downside sweep toward $0.16, followed by an aggressive rebound of nearly 20% from that intraday low. OP is compressing within the Alligator cluster around $0.195–$0.198, pointing to balance rather than trend expansion. OPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The RSI has recovered into the mid-40s, showing improving short-term momentum, while OBV is curling higher, hinting at early accumulation. Still, price remains capped below the Alligator jaw near $0.202, and repeated rejection in the $0.20–$0.205 zone would likely expose $0.185 again.

OP is in a technical pause where oversold conditions support stabilization, but the dominant trend remains bearish unless price decisively reclaims overhead resistance with volume. Is Optimism a good crypto investment? Optimism (OP) could be a good investment if you believe in Ethereum scaling and the growth of Layer 2 solutions. However, like all crypto, it’s risky, and its value depends on adoption and market trends. Only invest what you’re willing to lose! Will OP recover? A recovery is possible, but we fear the overall bearish sentiment makes a short-term rebound unlikely. However, as the market consolidates, we expect reduced volatility, which may lead to a breakout in either direction, depending on market dynamics. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in its price. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and require unprecedented growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook.

The expert alluded to Ripple’s roadmap for institutional DeFi on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), with the firm noting that XRP is at the core of all these plans. Developments XRP Holders Should Focus On In an X post , Cypress stated that every holder should pay attention to the developments Ripple outlined in its institutional DeFi roadmap. The expert highlighted features such as native on-chain privacy, permissioned markets, and institutional lending, which are set to live in the coming months on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) . Ripple noted that with these features, the XRP Ledger isn’t just positioning itself as a chain for tokenization but as an end-to-end operating system for real-world finance. Meanwhile, Cypress highlighted Ripple’s statement about how the indirect impact that they can focus attention on is through how XRP is used in base-layer operations. These operations include reserve requirements, transaction fees, which result in burning XRP , and bridging currency in FX and lending flows. Ripple also mentioned that each feature, both the ones that are already and the upcoming ones, is not a silo but a building block for “composable financial ecosystems,” which is tied together by XRP. Ripple declared that institutional DeFi is no longer theoretical as the XRPL is delivering the infrastructure these institutions need with programmable lending, privacy-preserving collateral, and regulated token markets. The firm added that XRP sits at the center of that infrastructure as a transactional asset and also as a utility-rich protocol token that connects the pieces together. Ripple added how stablecoin FX, tokenized treasuries , on-chain loans, and smart escrows all depend on XRP’s functionality. Ripple’s Roadmap Boosts Market Sentiment Towards XRP Ripple’s institutional roadmap appears to have boosted market sentiment towards XRP, with the token one of the top gainers among the top cryptos by market cap. Specifically, this may have contributed to the spike in whale transactions during the recent dip, with 1,389 whale transactions of $100,000 or more, which is the highest in four months, according to Santiment . Furthermore, the number of unique addresses on the XRPL has surged to 78,727 in just one 8-hour candle, which is the highest in six months. This suggests a bullish sentiment not just among whales but also among retail investors. Meanwhile, Santiment noted that the increase in whale accumulation and spike in unique addresses are both major signals of a price reversal for any asset. As such, there is the possibility that the drop to $1.15 may have marked the bottom for XRP. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $1.47, up 15% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",XRP|Coinmarketcap|Cypress|DeFi|FX|ripple|Santiment|stablecoin|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRPL|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|WALLET|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-02-08 00:00:12

When charts flatten, and narratives recycle, fatigue sets in fast. Recent Bitcoin news highlights cautious positioning as traders wait for fresh catalysts. SPX6900 and Dogecoin remain widely held, yet upside feels diluted after repeated hype cycles. Large-cap meme coins now depend on renewed speculation instead of structural growth. That shift has triggered a quiet rotation. Attention is moving toward projects that offer defined entry points, visible progression, and participation before price discovery fully unfolds. That rotation explains the rising focus on APEMARS . Instead of chasing post-listing volatility, participants are positioning during presale stages with transparent mechanics. Structured pricing, scheduled progress, and visible community engagement create momentum earlier in the cycle. This approach reframes risk around timing rather than hype. As fatigue builds across established names, APEMARS captures attention as the best crypto to buy today. APEMARS ($APRZ): Why Early Momentum Matters for the Best Crypto to Buy Today APEMARS enters the spotlight as the best crypto to buy today by focusing on early participation rather than late speculation. The presale currently operates at Stage 7, priced at $0.00005576, with over $145,000 raised. More than 745 holders have secured over 6.1 billion tokens. This structure emphasizes steady adoption before listings. High-yield staking introduces long-term incentives, while predefined stage progression creates visible momentum. Instead of waiting for exchange liquidity, engagement forms earlier, building a conviction layer by layer. Momentum extends beyond pricing. APEMARS integrates a viral referral system designed to reward organic growth rather than paid hype. Participants unlock additional rewards through structured referrals, reinforcing network effects. The long-term roadmap includes scheduled token burns and ecosystem expansion, aligning scarcity with adoption. Earlier participants entered Stage 7 at $0.00005576, targeting a transparent listing price of $0.0055. That pricing gap reflects structure, not speculation, making early-stage momentum feel intentional rather than accidental. Turning $2,000 Into Early-Stage Positioning Power A $2,000 allocation at Stage 7 pricing of $0.00005576 secured approximately 35.8 million $APRZ tokens. With the intended listing price set at $0.0055, the modeled upside reflects the presale’s transparent structure. This scenario highlights timing advantages rather than guarantees. Stage progression increases pricing weekly, rewarding earlier access through lower entry levels. The focus remains on structured participation, where momentum builds gradually. Diamond hands pay off when conviction forms before volatility arrives. A Simple Path Into the APEMARS Presale Joining the APEMARS presale follows a straightforward process. Participants connect a compatible wallet and select a preferred payment method. Tokens are allocated instantly based on the active stage price. Staking options become available for long-term participants seeking yield. Referral features unlock additional incentives through verified engagement. Progression through stages is public, creating urgency without pressure. This design supports informed decisions while maintaining transparency throughout participation. SPX6900 ($SPX): Large-Cap Meme Stability Meets Slower Momentum SPX6900 remains a recognizable meme-driven asset with broad awareness. Its ecosystem benefits from liquidity depth and exchange accessibility. However, recent Bitcoin price today movements reveal slower speculative rotation into large-cap memes. SPX6900 now relies more on broader market sentiment than internal catalysts. That dynamic limits asymmetric upside during consolidation phases. Stability appeals to conservative positioning, but acceleration often requires renewed hype cycles. Feature-wise, SPX6900 maintains standard meme mechanics without significant structural innovation. Community engagement remains active, yet growth feels incremental rather than explosive. As Bitcoin news continues to influence risk appetite, SPX6900 mirrors broader sentiment rather than leading it. This places the token firmly in a late-cycle posture, attractive for exposure but less compelling for early-stage momentum seekers. Dogecoin ($DOGE): Cultural Icon Facing Diminishing Returns Dogecoin continues to dominate meme culture through brand recognition and widespread adoption. Its proof-of-work structure and broad exchange support provide resilience. However, upside potential narrows as market capitalization grows. Dogecoin’s price movements increasingly correlate with macro sentiment rather than internal development. References to Cardano price prediction or Cardano 2025 price often overshadow DOGE in forward-looking discussions. From a feature standpoint, Dogecoin emphasizes simplicity and community loyalty. That strength becomes a limitation during cycles seeking innovation. While DOGE remains relevant, traders searching for early-stage positioning often look elsewhere. Late-cycle assets depend on renewed speculation, whereas structured presales attract attention through clarity and defined progression. Conclusion Recent developments across SPX6900 and Dogecoin highlight late-cycle fatigue. Both assets remain relevant, yet upside relies heavily on renewed hype. As market participants assess positioning, the best crypto to buy today increasingly reflects timing advantages rather than brand familiarity. According to research compiled by best crypto to buy now , capital rotation often favors early-stage structures during consolidation phases. That perspective aligns with broader market behavior, including Bitcoin and alternative asset trends. APEMARS stands out through its presale performance and structured design. Stage-based pricing, visible progression, and upcoming burns support sustained momentum. Current ROI modeling from Stage 7 to listing reflects structure, not speculation. For informed participants, APEMARS offers early-stage exposure with defined mechanics. Exploration remains open while Stage 7 pricing windows still exist, reinforcing urgency through progression rather than promises.

APEMARS focuses on early-stage participation through structured presale stages. Community engagement forms before listings, creating momentum earlier than large-cap meme coins that rely on post-listing speculation. Is APEMARS considered a next 1000x meme coin? APEMARS is positioned as an early-stage project with defined progression. While some view it as a next 1000x meme coin, outcomes depend on adoption, execution, and market conditions. How does the APEMARS presale pricing work? Pricing increases with each stage. Earlier stages offer lower entry prices, rewarding early participation. The intended listing price of $0.0055 creates a transparent pricing gap. Can tokens be staked during the presale? Yes, APEMARS includes high-yield staking options. These incentives encourage long-term holding and community participation throughout the presale and beyond. Where can reliable research on early-stage crypto projects be found? Many investors reference ranking platforms and research hubs such as thebestcryptotobuynow to compare early-stage opportunities alongside established assets. Glossary of Key Terms Presale Stage: A defined pricing phase before public listing Listing Price: Targeted initial exchange trading price Token Burn: Permanent removal of tokens from supply Staking: Locking tokens to earn rewards Liquidity: Ease of buying or selling an asset Market Cap: Total circulating value of a token Referral System: Incentive model for community-driven growth Summary This article explores the contrast between late-cycle fatigue in large-cap meme coins and early-stage momentum in structured presales. It highlights how SPX6900 and Dogecoin face diluted upside due to size and reliance on hype cycles. APEMARS emerges as an early-stage alternative, emphasizing transparent presale stages, defined pricing progression, staking incentives, and community-first growth. The narrative avoids claims of superiority, instead framing APEMARS as earlier in the cycle, which supports psychological conviction and legal clarity. With Stage 7 priced at $0.00005576 and a planned listing price of $0.0055, the presale structure rewards timing and participation. The article positions APEMARS as the best crypto to buy today for informed readers seeking early exposure.

In his new report, the analyst highlighted that Solana’s market structure still remains decisively bearish, especially after its recent crash to two-year lows. Despite the downtrend, Umair Crypto believes that Solana could still build enough momentum to reach higher levels. He has shared multiple bullish and a few bearish targets for the cryptocurrency, depending on its next price movements. Solana Price Faces Sharp Downtrend Amid Key Support Losses In his recent X post, Umair shared a chart analysis, predicting that the Solana price could recover and potentially climb back above $150. He provided detailed insights into the cryptocurrency’s recent downtrend and highlighted what a potential recovery might look like if the price breaks through key resistance levels. Related Reading: Polygon Hits $3.50 Billion In Payments As Crypto Activity Expands According to Umair, Solana’s price action turned sharply bearish after breaking key support levels and crashing below $80 earlier this week. The analyst noted that SOL lost the $100 Point Of Control (POC) from the January 2024 range. As a result, the price quickly dropped toward the next POC zone between $67 and $73. This decline represented a clean move downward of about 27%, highlighting how fragile higher price levels have become amid broader market weakness. Following the price drop, Umair reported that Solana staged a modest 12% bounce from the lower zone. This movement confirmed the area as a volume-heavy region capable of temporarily attracting buyers. Despite this, the chart still signals caution, as Solana is already pulling back while trading volume continues to increase. The analyst emphasized that the combination of rising volume and price declines typically indicates a downside conviction rather than a V-shape recovery setup. Consequently, it suggests that SOL’s decline could continue, making a quick price reversal unlikely. Path To Recovery And Higher Price Targets While the broader technical picture supports a bearish outlook for Solana, Umair Crypto still believes the cryptocurrency can stage a recovery to new highs, albeit slowly. He marked the former point of control near $100.93 as a key level to watch, noting that it now acts as a resistance. According to the analyst, the best-case scenario for Solana would be to build a base within its current range, flip its daily bullish structure, and use that structure as support for any future price recoveries. Without this, any sustained trend reversal is unlikely. Related Reading: Bitcoin Edges Past Gold In Appeal, JPMorgan Says If SOL breaks above the $100.93 level, Umair Crypto predicts the next price targets would be $120.59, $128.43, $138.77, and $150.36. In his original analysis, the analyst shared an even higher target, forecasting a surge to between $200 and $210 if Solana can maintain momentum above $150.36.

To demonstrate the intense nature of the situation, Bitcoin developer Mononaut noted that this recent decline is the largest one-time reduction recorded since the country enacted a substantial ban five years ago. Moreover, reports from reliable sources noted that the drop ranked tenth among the largest percentage declines on record. Analysts raise concerns about the mining difficulty status in China Following the decline in China’s Bitcoin mining difficulty, analysts conducted research and discovered that the drop was attributed to about a 20% decrease in total hashrate over the last 30 days. Regarding this finding, Luxor Technology Corporation, a premier full-stack Bitcoin mining services provider, released data showing that its Hashrate Index dropped by 11% last week, hitting a record low of 863 EH/s, compared to October’s all-time high above 1.1 ZH/s. In attempts to explain the decline in hashrate, sources pointed to Bitcoin’s price decline as the main reason. Regarding this argument, they acknowledged that the price of the cryptocurrency has fallen by more than 45% from its all-time high of more than $126,000 in October. To support this claim, data released on February 5 highlighted that Bitcoin’s price plummeted to a record low of around $60,000 before bouncing back to about $68,800 yesterday. Higher Treasury yields, persistent ETF outflows, and a broad retreat from risk-on assets, such as stocks and commodities, fueled this sell-off. At this particular moment, SoSoValue , an AI-powered, Singapore-founded cryptocurrency research and investment platform, shared reports indicating that US spot bitcoin ETFs have emerged as net sellers this year. Another reason for the drop in China’s Bitcoin mining difficulty is Winter Storm Fern, a major, wide-reaching severe weather event triggered by an Arctic air mass clashing with Gulf moisture. This weather event in late January forced miners across diverse regions of the United States to scale back their operations to help stabilize overloaded residential power grids. At this point, the storm caused the shutdown of approximately 200 EH/s of power supply, prompting Foundry USA’s hash rate to decline to approximately 60%. As the situation worsened, Ben Harper, the Director of Derivatives at Luxor Technology, decided to weigh in on the topic of discussion. Harper stressed that hashprice, a metric that quantifies the expected daily revenue (in USD or BTC) a miner earns for a specific unit of hashrate, plummeted to unprecedented lows of $33.31 per petahash per second per day on February 2, and to an average daily low of $34.91/PH/s/day on February 1. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that miners typically use a $40/PH/s/day benchmark to determine whether to maintain operational status. The Bitcoin mining sector in China encounters several changes Regarding the recent situation surrounding Bitcoin mining in China, reports dated February 2 indicated that only miners with the latest Antminer S23 series machines are currently generating substantial returns. With this discovery in mind, data from Antpool noted that older models such as the Whatsminer M6 series and Antminer S21 units are nearing, or have already reached, unprofitability. In response to the recent decline in Bitcoin mining difficulty in China, reports revealed that the drop exceeded the approximately 7.5% seen in June last year. This decrease resulted from heatwave-related reductions in hashrate. Meanwhile, aside from the drop in June last year, analysts noted a similar case in early February 2025. Generally, sources reported that the profitability outlook for Bitcoin mining in China is deteriorating rapidly. This came after reports from Checkonchain revealed that the average cost of mining one Bitcoin is approximately $87,000 . On the other hand, spot prices are hovering near $69,000, roughly 20% below production costs. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

Forbes claims that the Tesla CEO’s net worth has hit $845 billion, making him the first person to ever cross $800 billion. That’s more than Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Mark Zuckerberg (2nd, 3rd, and 4th richest people) combined. Tesla is Elon’s most recognizable work, as much as he hates it. But to get to his goal of being worth more than literal advanced economies, this guy isn’t relying on the so-called “automaker,” he is relying on SpaceX. Now already, nearly two-thirds of Elon’s wealth now comes from SpaceX. That number exploded after SpaceX took over his other company, xAI, the one that builds AI and owns the social media platform X (formerly Twitter). The deal gave the combined company a value of $1.25 trillion, based on financial records. Elon owns about 43% of it. That means his stake is now worth more than $530 billion. SpaceX takeover of xAI changes where his money comes from The xAI merger of course pushed Elon even closer to trillionaire status. SpaceX already launches satellites, builds rockets, works with the U.S. government, and runs its own defense projects. xAI brings in a powerful AI model and full control of a platform that runs on political drama and user engagement. SpaceX has already brought in more than $20 billion from U.S. government contracts, based on research from FedScout. Elon said the new merger is part of building orbital data centers, which would use satellites to run AI systems above Earth instead of inside data warehouses. Elon’s changing focus hasn’t gone unnoticed. In Tesla’s latest proxy filing, the company stated that “a majority of Mr. Musk’s wealth is now derived from other business ventures.” And boy, that is not good at all. Elon plans to take SpaceX public sometime in 2026. If he does, it could give him access to more cash and increase his ranking again. But the business itself is a mix of military contracts, satellites, and a high-cost AI model trying to go against Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic. Public investors might not want to buy into that. Tesla pay package and political power tighten the focus Elon still has a reason to care about Tesla. Last year, Cryptopolitan reported that Tesla shareholders approved a pay package that could be worth $1 trillion. But it’s not guaranteed. The deal is split into 12 tranches, and he only gets paid if Tesla hits a set of milestones. The first goal is for Tesla to reach a $2 trillion valuation, which is about $460 billion more than where it sits right now. Tesla’s board made the deal to keep Elon focused. They said it was designed to “prevent him from prioritizing those other ventures.” But Elon’s influence doesn’t stop at rockets and cars. His money is reaching into politics too. A report from Oxfam said that at least five people could become trillionaires in the next ten years. In 2024, billionaire wealth grew by $2 trillion, while poverty rates stayed almost exactly the same as they were in 1990. Oxfam’s director Amitabh Behar said, “The crown jewel of this oligarchy is a billionaire president, backed and bought by the world’s richest man Elon Musk, running the world’s largest economy. We present this report as a stark wake-up call that ordinary people the world over are being crushed by the enormous wealth of a tiny few.” Elon uses his control of X to affect politics.

Over the past year, Cryptopolitan has diligently reported that the US government has taken actual equity or governance stakes in at least 10 different businesses, mostly tied to minerals, chips, energy, and defense. These investments are going into startups, mining projects, semiconductor makers, and even a nuclear reactor developer. Some deals give the government voting rights. Others don’t. But in every case, taxpayer money is buying a piece of the company. Scott Lincicome from the Cato Institute said this kind of government buying spree hasn’t been seen outside of wartime. Howard, the Commerce Secretary, said more of this is coming. He even named Lockheed Martin as a possible target. Steel, rare earths, and semiconductors now have government money in them Let’s start with U.S. Steel. Trump only approved the company’s sale to Nippon Steel after getting a special power called a golden share. It doesn’t bring any profit, but it lets the president block decisions to shut plants, sell assets, or move the headquarters out of Pittsburgh. U.S. Steel stopped trading in June 2025 and now operates as a Nippon subsidiary. Then there’s Intel. In August 2025, the Commerce Department bought 433.3 million shares, or 10% of Intel , using $8.9 billion pulled from CHIPS Act funds and other grants. The shares are non-voting. Howard said the goal wasn’t control, but financial support. The Defense Department also went deep into rare earths. It invested in MP Materials, a company with a mine in Mountain Pass, California. The Pentagon bought $400 million in preferred stock and got a warrant that could give it 15% of the company. MP said that would make the government its largest shareholder. On the lithium front, the Department of Energy took a 5% stake in Lithium Americas, plus 5% in its joint project with GM. In return, it delayed $182 million in payments on a $2.3 billion loan. One Trump official allegedly told CNBC this structure gives taxpayers protection “if things go south.” The company’s listed in Canada and the U.S. Even startups with no revenue are getting millions from Washington Trilogy Metals, also based in Canada, has no revenue. It wants to mine copper in Alaska using a long, controversial road called Ambler Road. Trump approved the permits in October 2025. The government then threw in $35.6 million, taking a 10% stake and the right to buy another 7.5%. USA Rare Earth, which plans to dig rare earths in Texas and build magnets in Oklahoma, got a $1.3 billion loan and $277 million in grants this year. In return, it handed the government 16.1 million shares and 17.6 million in warrants. Depending on what happens with the warrants, the stake could land between 8% and 16%. CEO Barbara said this was an economic deal only. No government control. Vulcan Elements, a private company from North Carolina, joined with ReElement Technologies to create a rare earth magnet supply chain. They’re building a 10,000 metric ton factory. The Pentagon gave them $620 million, Commerce gave them $550 million, and they raised the same amount from private investors. The government got a $50 million stake, plus warrants. Meanwhile, xLight, a chip tool startup from Palo Alto, is working on free-electron lasers. In December, Commerce said it would take a $150 million equity stake if the company accepts federal funding. Pentagon now owns part of a missile business and could buy into nuclear power L3Harris, a huge defense company, struck a deal in December 2025 to get $1 billion from the Pentagon for its rocket motor division. The agreement says the division will go public in late 2026, and at that point, the Pentagon’s investment will become common stock in the new company. The U.S. is also dipping into nuclear energy. The government signed a deal in October 2025 with Cameco and Brookfield to fund Westinghouse, which builds nuclear reactors. The full project is worth $80 billion. If Westinghouse grows past a $30 billion valuation, the government can demand an IPO before 2029 and walk away with 8% ownership, according to Cameco’s COO Grant. All in, the Trump administration is using taxpayer money to buy into firms across rare earths, semiconductors, lithium, nuclear, and defense. These aren’t donations. They’re ownership deals, plain and simple. And the government now sits inside boardrooms it used to just regulate.

That’s not a guess. That’s data from the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which traders use to see how hard a stock got hit. A reading below 30 means a stock is oversold. But this week was so brutal, both of them fell way under that. PayPal dropped to an RSI under 11. That’s insane. On top of that, the stock lost more than 24% this week. It’s the worst weekly drop PayPal has ever had. The crash came after PayPal gave a weak earnings forecast for 2026 on Tuesday.The company also announced that Alex Chriss is out as CEO.That hit investors hard.Most analysts aren’t calling it a buy, but they aren’t dumping it either. LSEG data shows the average analyst rating on PayPal is “hold.” That said, price targets show a possible 40% upside over the next year. No guarantees, though. The bloodbath this week was real. Coinbase slides 25% as Bitcoin crumbles Coinbase also made the oversold list with an RSI of around 14. It got crushed this week too. Shares fell 25% by Friday morning. That happened as Bitcoin dropped hard. Since Coinbase depends so much on crypto trading volume, it got dragged down right with it. The stock bounced a little Friday as Bitcoin recovered some of its earlier loss.But even with that bounce, Coinbase still ended the week deep in the red.Analysts are still betting big on it. Most of them rate it a buy. And the average target price shows a possible 100% gain from here. Whether or not it actually happens depends on where crypto goes next. The selloff this week didn’t stop with just those two. KKR & Co., a big name in alternative assets, also ended the week oversold. Its RSI fell below 20, and the stock dropped more than 13%. The fear here is about artificial intelligence Investors are nervous that it is about to shake up the software inudstry. Since KKR is tied to that space through its credit investments, the worry spread to them too. Even with that fear, most analysts haven’t bailed. LSEG data shows a majority still have buy ratings on KKR. And the average price forecast shows the stock could rise over 53% in the next twelve months. Again, that’s if nothing else goes wrong. Then there’s Palantir, which dropped 13% this week. It had a huge rally over the last year, but the good times stopped fast. Just like KKR, the panic was about AI. People are worried that new models will eat into older software companies’ profits. Palantir reports earnings on Monday after the close, so everyone’s watching. Rishi Jaluria from RBC Capital Markets is still bearish. Back on January 26, he kept his “underperform” rating on Palantir and stuck with a $50 target. He warned that unless something major happens in the next earnings report, the current price doesn’t make sense. Right now, Palantir has an RSI of 26.3, according to data from TradingView.

While prices drift and fear dominates the market, smart money quietly accumulates, laying the groundwork for the next potential trend shift. Testing Conviction: Bitcoin In One Of Its Deepest Bear Market Zones Over the past few weeks, volatility has intensified, causing Bitcoin’s price to fall sharply. Marcus Corvinus highlighted that Bitcoin is trading in one of the deepest bear market zones in history, an area that doesn’t shout buy now but instead tests conviction and patience. These are the zones where price can drift aimlessly, bleed, and frustrate traders for weeks or even months. It’s not a sign of weakness; rather, strong hands are quietly accumulating while fear dominates the market narrative. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hits Deep Demand As Liquidity Finally Sweeps The Lows These phases are always messy and uncomfortable. Sentiment is crushed, capitulation feels endless, and confidence is at its lowest. Retail traders often panic or step aside during these times, which is exactly why these opportunities are so often missed. The real shift in trend rarely begins with hype or dramatic rallies. Instead, it starts with stabilization, absorption, and subtle recovery signals that are only visible to those who are patient. Quiet accumulation, a slowing of selling pressure, and small rebounds all hint that the market may be preparing for its next meaningful move. History doesn’t ring a bell at the bottom. It punishes doubt before it rewards belief. Marcus concludes that he is watching this zone very closely. While it won’t last forever, when it finally ends, most market participants will wish they had paid attention. The opportunity lies in recognizing the signals while others are blinded by fear and frustration. Resistance Holds At $71,000 — What It Means For Bulls Crypto analyst Crypto Candy noted that Bitcoin is moving largely as expected. As previously mentioned, a pullback from the $61,000–$58,000 zone toward the $70,000–$67,000 area was likely, and that scenario has unfolded precisely as predicted. The market reacted within this range, confirming the anticipated short-term price dynamics. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hits Deep Demand As Liquidity Finally Sweeps The Lows Crypto Candy also highlighted that although BTC touched $71,000, it was unable to close above that level on the daily timeframe. This reinforces the idea that until Bitcoin decisively reclaims this zone, short-term retracements remain the primary expectation. Looking ahead, Crypto Candy emphasized that a bullish scenario can only be considered in the short term if BTC closes above $71,000. Until that happens, the market may continue to test lower ranges, and retracements from the current zone are expected.
