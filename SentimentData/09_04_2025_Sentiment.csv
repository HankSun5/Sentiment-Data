The digital currency world never ceases to amaze, and this time, it’s Binance Alpha making headlines with a rather…unconventional listing. According to recent reports surfacing from the Binance app itself and highlighted by Odaily News, Binance Alpha has apparently launched support for a cryptocurrency that goes by the name of Retard Finder Coin (RFC) . Yes, you read that right. In a move that has left many scratching their heads and the crypto-sphere buzzing with questions, this seemingly obscure coin has found its way onto a platform associated with the global giant, Binance. Let’s dive into what we know so far and what this intriguing development might mean for the future of altcoin listings and the ever-evolving landscape of crypto trading. What Exactly is Binance Alpha and Why Does This Listing Matter? Before we delve deeper into the specifics of Retard Finder Coin (RFC) , it’s crucial to understand the platform in question: Binance Alpha . While details about Binance Alpha are still emerging, it appears to be a distinct entity or perhaps a specialized section within the broader Binance ecosystem. It’s not the main Binance exchange that most users are familiar with, but rather something more niche, possibly focused on newer or higher-risk crypto projects. This distinction is important because listings on Binance Alpha might carry different implications than a listing on the main Binance platform. It could suggest a testing ground for emerging altcoins , a platform for more speculative trading, or a separate initiative altogether. Why does this listing matter? Well, any association with the Binance brand carries significant weight in the crypto world. Binance is a behemoth, and even a listing on a subsidiary platform like Binance Alpha can bring attention, volume, and potentially, legitimacy to a previously unknown altcoin . For Retard Finder Coin (RFC) , this listing, regardless of the platform’s exact nature, is a major development. Increased Visibility: Being listed on a platform associated with Binance instantly puts RFC on the radar of a massive global audience of crypto traders and investors. Potential for Liquidity: A listing often brings increased trading volume and liquidity, making it easier for people to buy and sell the coin. Credibility Boost (of sorts): While the name itself is…unconventional, the Binance association can lend a degree of perceived credibility, at least in the short term. Retard Finder Coin (RFC): Decoding the Unconventional Name Let’s address the elephant in the room – the name: Retard Finder Coin (RFC) . In a world where crypto projects often strive for sophisticated and tech-forward names, RFC stands out for its sheer audacity and…well, frankly, its controversial nature. The term “retard” is considered offensive and derogatory in many contexts, and its use in the name of a cryptocurrency is bound to raise eyebrows and spark debate. One can only speculate on the intentions behind this name. Is it meant to be ironic? A deliberate attempt to be provocative and generate buzz? A misguided attempt at humor? Or perhaps, a cultural or linguistic nuance lost in translation? Whatever the reason, the name is undeniably attention-grabbing, and in the crowded world of altcoins , standing out – even for controversial reasons – can sometimes be a strategy. However, it’s crucial to consider the potential downsides of such a name: Reputational Risk: The offensive nature of the name could deter serious investors and damage the coin’s long-term prospects. Regulatory Scrutiny: Authorities might take a dim view of a cryptocurrency with a name that could be considered offensive or discriminatory. Community Backlash: The crypto community, while often embracing memes and humor, may find the name distasteful and reject the project. Could this be a meme coin? Given the name, it’s tempting to categorize RFC as just another meme coin, designed for short-term hype and speculation. However, the Binance Alpha listing adds a layer of complexity. Binance, even on a subsidiary platform, typically conducts some level of due diligence before listing a coin. This suggests there might be more to RFC than just a provocative name. Or perhaps, Binance Alpha is taking a more experimental approach to listings, willing to embrace higher-risk, higher-reward projects, even those with controversial branding. The Crypto Listing Announcement: What We Know and What’s Missing The news of the crypto listing of Retard Finder Coin (RFC) on Binance Alpha is currently based on reports originating from the Binance app itself, as highlighted by Odaily News. However, crucial details remain shrouded in mystery. The announcement, as it stands, is rather barebones. Here’s what we know based on the current information: Listing Platform: Binance Alpha is the platform where RFC is reportedly listed. Source of Information: The information comes from the Binance app and was reported by Odaily News. And here’s what we are still waiting to learn: Trading Pairs: Which cryptocurrencies or fiat currencies will RFC be paired with for trading? (e.g., RFC/USDT, RFC/BTC). Trading Start Date and Time: When will trading officially commence? Deposit and Withdrawal Details: When will users be able to deposit and withdraw RFC to and from the platform? Project Details: What is the underlying technology, purpose, or use case of Retard Finder Coin (RFC) ? What problem does it solve? What is its tokenomics? Binance Official Announcement: Has Binance itself issued an official announcement or blog post about this listing? Official confirmation from Binance would lend more credibility and detail to the news. The lack of these details leaves room for speculation and caution. Investors should approach this crypto listing with extreme caution until more information becomes available. It’s essential to conduct thorough research and understand the risks involved before considering investing in any altcoin , especially one with such limited publicly available information and a controversial name. Navigating the Altcoin Landscape: Is RFC a Gem or a Gamble? The altcoin market is a wild frontier. It’s a place where fortunes can be made and lost in the blink of an eye. Retard Finder Coin (RFC) , with its unconventional name and enigmatic nature, perfectly embodies the high-risk, high-reward potential of the altcoin space. Investing in altcoins , particularly newly listed ones, is inherently riskier than investing in established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Here’s a breakdown of the potential risks and rewards associated with investing in altcoins like RFC : Risks Potential Rewards High Volatility: Altcoins are often subject to extreme price swings. High Growth Potential: Some altcoins can experience explosive growth, delivering massive returns to early investors. Lack of Information: Information about new altcoins can be scarce and unreliable. Early Entry Advantage: Investing early in a promising altcoin can be incredibly lucrative if the project succeeds. Scams and Rug Pulls: The altcoin space is rife with scams and projects that fail to deliver on their promises. Technological Innovation: Some altcoins represent genuinely innovative technologies and solutions. Liquidity Issues: Newer altcoins may have limited liquidity, making it difficult to buy or sell large amounts without affecting the price. Community Driven Growth: Strong community support can drive the adoption and value of an altcoin . For Retard Finder Coin (RFC) specifically, the risks are amplified by the lack of information and the controversial name. It could be a high-risk gamble with the potential for significant gains if it gains traction, or it could just as easily be a flash in the pan, or worse, something less legitimate. What is the Future of RFC? Uncertainty and Speculation Abound Predicting the future of any cryptocurrency is a fool’s errand, and this is especially true for Retard Finder Coin (RFC) given the current information vacuum. Will RFC become the next big meme coin sensation? Will it fade into obscurity as quickly as it appeared? Will the controversial name ultimately be its downfall, or a strangely effective marketing ploy? At this point, it’s all speculation. The success or failure of RFC will likely depend on a number of factors, including: Community Response: How will the crypto community react to the name and the project? Will it be embraced as ironic and humorous, or rejected as offensive? Project Development: If there is a genuine project behind RFC , will the developers be able to build something of value and utility? Binance Alpha’s Intentions: What is Binance Alpha’s strategy with listing coins like RFC ? Are they embracing a more experimental approach to listings? Market Sentiment: The overall market sentiment towards altcoins and meme coins will also play a role. For now, Retard Finder Coin (RFC) remains an enigma. The Binance Alpha listing has undoubtedly put it on the map, but its future trajectory is anyone’s guess. Investors should exercise extreme caution, conduct thorough due diligence if more information emerges, and remember the golden rule of crypto investing: never invest more than you can afford to lose. Conclusion: The Crypto World Keeps Surprising Us The Binance Alpha listing of Retard Finder Coin (RFC) is a stark reminder of the unpredictable and often bizarre nature of the cryptocurrency world. It highlights the constant influx of new altcoins , the power of exchange listings to generate buzz, and the enduring fascination with meme culture within the crypto space. Whether RFC is a fleeting curiosity or something more substantial remains to be seen. For now, it serves as a captivating case study in the ever-evolving and often surprising world of digital currencies. Keep your eyes peeled for further updates, but remember to approach with caution and a healthy dose of skepticism. The crypto rollercoaster continues its wild ride!

43096996,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=147535,1744153230,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Unwavering Stance: Trump Rules Out Near-Term Tariff Relief, USTR Confirms",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-tariff-stance-no-relief/,"In a move that’s likely to send ripples across global markets, including the ever-volatile cryptocurrency sphere, former U.S. President Donald Trump has reportedly shut the door on any immediate tariff exemptions. This firm stance, relayed by U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, signals a continuation of potentially disruptive trade policies. But what does this mean for the global economy and, more specifically, for the crypto market we closely watch? Trump’s Unyielding Position on Tariffs: What’s the Message? According to a recent update from Walter Bloomberg on X, USTR Greer stated unequivocally that President Trump has ruled out any tariff exemptions in the foreseeable future. This announcement is not just a minor policy tweak; it’s a clear indication that the protectionist trade measures initiated during Trump’s previous term could be here to stay, or even intensify should he regain office. For businesses and investors worldwide, this news brings a renewed sense of uncertainty. Let’s break down what this could imply: No Immediate Relief for Businesses: Companies hoping for a reprieve from existing tariffs will likely need to brace for continued financial pressures. This could affect supply chains, pricing strategies, and overall profitability. Potential for Escalation: The lack of exemptions might be interpreted as a signal that the U.S. is prepared to maintain or even escalate trade tensions with its partners, potentially leading to retaliatory tariffs from other nations. Impact on Global Trade Flows: Sustained tariffs can disrupt established trade routes and patterns, forcing businesses to seek alternative sourcing and markets, often at increased costs and complexities. How Does Trump’s Trade Policy Impact the Global Economy? The global economy is a complex web of interconnected markets, and trade policies enacted by major players like the United States have far-reaching consequences. Trump’s decision to rule out tariff exemptions is a significant factor to consider when assessing the current and future health of the global economic landscape. Here’s a closer look at the potential impacts: Impact Area Potential Effects Inflation Tariffs can lead to higher import costs, which may be passed on to consumers in the form of increased prices for goods and services, contributing to inflationary pressures. Economic Growth Trade disputes and tariffs can dampen economic growth by increasing business costs, reducing investment, and creating uncertainty in the market. Supply Chains Tariffs can disrupt global supply chains, forcing companies to restructure their operations, potentially leading to inefficiencies and delays. Geopolitical Relations Aggressive trade policies can strain international relations and lead to trade wars, impacting diplomatic ties and global cooperation. USTR Greer’s Confirmation: What Does It Mean for US Trade Relations? The role of the United States Trade Representative ( USTR ) is crucial in shaping and implementing U.S. trade policy. Jamieson Greer’s confirmation that no tariff exemptions are on the horizon carries significant weight. It suggests a unified stance within the Trump administration on maintaining a hard line on trade . This could indicate: Policy Consistency: Greer’s statement reinforces the idea that Trump’s trade policies are not merely negotiating tactics but represent a fundamental shift in approach. Limited Negotiation Flexibility: The absence of exemptions signals reduced flexibility in trade negotiations, potentially making it harder to reach agreements with trading partners. Focus on Domestic Industry: This stance likely prioritizes the protection of domestic industries, even if it comes at the cost of potentially strained international trade relationships. Cryptocurrency and the Global Economic Uncertainty: Where Do Tariffs Fit In? You might be wondering, how do tariffs and trade policies relate to the cryptocurrency market? While not a direct link, the connection lies in the broader global economy and investor sentiment. Here’s how: Economic Uncertainty Fuels Crypto Interest: Periods of economic uncertainty, often triggered by events like trade disputes and tariff implementations, can increase investor interest in alternative assets like cryptocurrencies. Some view crypto as a hedge against traditional market volatility. Impact on Risk Appetite: Trade tensions can negatively impact overall market sentiment, leading to a decrease in risk appetite. While this might initially seem negative for crypto (a risk asset), it can also push investors towards assets perceived as uncorrelated or having different risk profiles than traditional stocks and bonds. Global Economic Outlook: Cryptocurrencies operate on a global scale. A weakened global economy due to trade wars can affect crypto adoption and investment flows across borders. Conversely, in some regions facing economic hardship exacerbated by trade issues, crypto might become more appealing as a means of value preservation or cross-border transactions. Navigating the Tariff Landscape: What Can Crypto Investors Watch For? While predicting the exact impact of tariffs on the crypto market is complex, staying informed and adaptable is key. Here are some actionable insights for crypto investors in light of these trade developments: Monitor Global Economic Indicators: Keep an eye on macroeconomic data, particularly indicators related to inflation, economic growth, and trade balances. These will provide clues about the broader economic impact of tariff policies. Track Geopolitical Developments: Pay attention to news and developments related to international trade relations and potential escalations of trade disputes. These events can significantly influence market sentiment. Diversify Your Portfolio: In times of economic uncertainty, diversification is crucial. Consider diversifying your crypto portfolio and also across different asset classes to mitigate risk. Stay Informed on Regulatory Responses: Governments and central banks may respond to trade-induced economic pressures with monetary or fiscal policies. Be aware of these responses as they can indirectly affect crypto markets. Conclusion: The Enduring Shadow of Tariffs on the Global Stage Trump’s firm stance on tariffs , as relayed by USTR Greer, injects a dose of reality into the global economic outlook. The message is clear: businesses and investors should not expect any near-term easing of trade pressures. For the cryptocurrency market, this development is another piece in the complex puzzle of global economic factors that can influence its trajectory. While the direct impact might be nuanced, the overarching theme of economic uncertainty and potential market volatility remains relevant. As we move forward, understanding these trade dynamics will be crucial for navigating the ever-evolving landscape of both traditional and digital finance.

But what exactly does that mean, and why should you be excited? Let’s break it down: Scalability for the Masses: Ethereum, while being the powerhouse of DeFi and NFTs, can get congested, leading to high gas fees and slow transaction times. This is a major hurdle for gaming, where quick and cost-effective transactions are crucial. ZKcandy, as a layer-2 scaling solution, operates on top of Ethereum, inheriting its security while drastically increasing transaction throughput and reducing costs. This means smoother gameplay and a better overall experience for gamers. Mobile-First Approach: ZKcandy is laser-focused on mobile gaming, a massive and rapidly growing market.

Unlocking the Potential of Layer-2 Scaling for Web3 Games Why is layer-2 scaling so critical for the future of Web3 gaming ?

Frustrating, right? This is where layer-2 solutions like ZKcandy step in to save the day. Here’s a table highlighting the key benefits of using layer-2 scaling for gaming: Benefit Description Impact on Gamers Lower Gas Fees Layer-2 networks bundle multiple transactions into a single transaction on the Ethereum mainnet, significantly reducing gas costs per user.

Ability to support complex and engaging games with vibrant economies and active player bases. Enhanced User Experience The combination of lower fees and faster transactions leads to a significantly better and more enjoyable gaming experience.

These initiatives are crucial for attracting both players and game developers to the platform. Token Incentives for Players: Rewarding players with tokens for participating in the ecosystem can drive user adoption and engagement. This could involve earning tokens through gameplay, completing challenges, or contributing to the community. These incentives create a more rewarding and engaging gaming experience, encouraging players to become active participants in the ZKcandy ecosystem. Developer Grants for Game Creation: Offering grants to game developers to build on the ZKcandy platform is a powerful way to expand the game library and attract innovative projects. These grants can provide financial support and resources, encouraging developers to explore the possibilities of Web3 gaming on ZKcandy. This fosters innovation and ensures a continuous influx of fresh and exciting content for players. Challenges and the Road Ahead for ZKcandy While ZKcandy presents an exciting step forward for Ethereum L2 gaming , it’s important to acknowledge potential challenges and the journey ahead: Competition in the L2 and Gaming Space: The layer-2 scaling landscape is becoming increasingly competitive, with various solutions vying for adoption.

The court paused the U.S. Judge William Alsup of San Francisco’s March 13 injunction, which required six federal agencies to reinstate thousands of newly hired probationary employees while the legality of the dismissals was being challenged. In addition, Trump presented the case as just another example of the federal judiciary stepping in to manage the decisions it claimed the executive branch ought to have established. Trump administration secures partial victory In a short, unsigned ruling, the court declared that the nine nonprofit organizations that received an injunction in response to their lawsuit lacked the legal standing to sue. In addition, based on the court’s argument, other plaintiffs’ claims in the case were not addressed in its order. According to them, this did not form the basis of the district court’s preliminary injunction. However, Ketanji Brown Jackson and Sonia Sotomayor, both liberal justices, openly disagreed with the ruling. Jackson gave a brief explanation, raising concerns and questioning the need for the high court’s immediate intervention. Moreover, the full implications of the decision were unclear since a federal judge in Maryland issued a preliminary injunction earlier this month that reinstated some of the employees not covered in the Supreme Court case. According to Georgetown University Law Center professor and Supreme Court analyst Steve Vladeck, the decision was relatively limited. In support of this, Vladeck mentioned that the court only stated that the nonprofit groups granted an injunction in San Francisco were not the appropriate parties to challenge the mass firing in this case. He continued that Trump had won once more, but only in terms of who can and cannot sue and in which courts. Additionally, the Supreme Court analyst highlighted that the other challenges to the mass firings had already led to government losses in other cases, and those rulings were left in place. Even so, the decision was a victory for the Trump administration, which had asked the high court to intervene to wipe out the order from the lower court. This came after the court allowed the administration to carry out deportations under the controversial Alien Enemies Act but with some additional limitations. Trump administration’s firing strategy targeted probationary employees with fewer job protections As part of its effort to shrink the size of the federal government, Trump administration targeted probationary employees as part of its drive to reduce the size of the federal government because they have fewer job protections and are more easily fired. Normally, those workers could not appeal their firing to the Merit Systems Protection Board; however, they might be able to do so if the dismissal was due to “partisan political reasons” or “marriage status.” Furthermore, concerning the situation, labor unions and other organizations challenged the Office of Personnel Management’s role in the firing, which impacted thousands of workers and sent shockwaves through different federal agencies, some of which went on to rehire some of the affected employees. On the other hand, U.S. District Judge William Alsup mandated the administration that more than 16,000 probationary employees should be allowed to return to work immediately. In his opinion, Alsup stated that each agency had, and still has, discretion over the hiring and firing of its own employees. In this case, OPM directed the agencies to terminate all probationary staff, and they carried out that directive. Sarah Harris, the administration’s acting solicitor general at the time, told the Supreme Court that the district court’s incredibly broad remedy was causing the Executive Branch actual, irreversible harm that needed this Court’s quick intervention.

Per a report from the Russian state-run news agency TASS , the FTS has also “posted information” on crypto “exchange” rates for taxpayers. Russian Crypto Miners: Ready to Pay Taxes? The FTS tool lets miners check on the exact “minimum closing price” in fiat rubles of popular coins on “foreign trading [platforms]” ( crypto exchanges ) on specific dates in the period January 1, 2025, to March 31. The Federal Tax Service’s tax calculation tool shows the price of Bitcoin at specific periods on the Binance crypto exchange. (Source: Federal Tax Service/Screenshot) Quoting the FTS’ press service, TASS reported that the agency’s website “has published information on market quotes for digital currencies and total volumes of daily trades with foreign trade organizers for taxpayers.” This, the FTS said, will help “taxpayers” to “determine income from digital currency transactions based on information from open sources.” “This will help taxpayers calculate the tax base for digital currency transactions on each individual date of income recognition.” Russian Federal Tax Service A Russian Soyuz rocket carrying an American astronaut and two Russian cosmonauts blasted off from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan for the International Space Station, Russia's Roscosmos space agency said https://t.co/P57xmvV9Nk — Reuters (@Reuters) April 8, 2025 The FTS noted that “digital currency obtained as a result of mining” is considered as a taxable form of income. And it wrote that “the value of digital currency is determined based on market prices on the date of the actual receipt of income.” The FTS clarified that cryptoassets become income on “the day when the person who acquired them has the right to sell them.” The Federal Tax Service’s tax calculation tool shows the price of DOGE at specific periods on the OKX crypto exchange. (Source: Federal Tax Service/Screenshot) ‘Framework’ in Place The tool, however, appears to be somewhat imperfect. At the time of writing, it only carries data from seven crypto exchanges, including Binance, ByBit, KuCoin, and MEXC. And while it collates data on a wide range of popular coins, including Bitcoin (BTC) and Dogecoin (DOGE) , some high-cap coins like Ethereum (ETH) and XRP appear to be missing from its database. The FTS has also added disclaimers to its new resource, noting that the information it provides “is subject to independent verification by the taxpayer.” Russia has already “legalized” crypto mining. And in November 2024, President Vladimir Putin signed a law stipulating the creation of a “framework” for taxing crypto miners.

The November law stipulates that crypto-related trades are subject to a two-tiered level of income tax. Those with earnings of up to 2.4 million rubles ($28,000) must pay levies of 13% on their earnings. Anyone earning more than this will be obliged to pay 15%, with corporations ordered to pay the regular corporate tax rate (25%) on their earnings.

The Russian crypto mining industry has previously assured Moscow that the Treasury can expect to make over half a billion USD per year from taxing miners. The FTS’ new web resources also contain instructions for what it calls “mining infrastructure operators.” It defines these as individuals or companies who “provide services for the provision of mining infrastructure for the activities of miners and mining pools.” Russian crypto experts have previously claimed that nine out of 10 mining firms focus their efforts on BTC (although some data compilers dispute this claim). However, Russian crypto enthusiasts have previously told Cryptonews.com that many home-based miners prefer to mine ETH. All experts also agree that Litecoin (LTC) – which is included in the FTS’ database – also enjoys a minority interest among major domestic mining players.

The surge in interest comes as XRP’s legal battles with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are at their tail end, with new institutional-focused products emerging for the Ripple-associated coin. Teucrium’s X2 Daily Long XRP ETF Sees Strong Start On its first day of trading, the 2X Daily Long ETF saw a trading volume of $5 million. Teucrium launched this product after approval by NYSE Arca . According to Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas, this performance places it in the top 5% of new ETFs launched. This result is particularly impressive given the current market conditions. For context, a similar product, the Solana 2X ETF (SOLT) garnered a fraction of this volume, or about four times less than XRP’s debut. This impressive performance suggests investors are keen to leverage their positions on XRP. Balchunas further shared his thoughts on the debut, calling the $5 million in volume respectable considering the market conditions. He noted that this performance while outpacing Solana’s, comes with a twist. He said it pales compared to BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) whose debut volume topped $1 billion. Spot XRP ETF Prospect As reported by CoinGape, John Deaton reflects on the four-year Ripple lawsuit, stating that XRP’s status as a non-security is a crucial boost to the growing push for exchange-traded funds tied to the coin. The filing of multiple XRP ETFs remains a hot topic in the market. With $1.5 trillion in assets under management (AUM), investment giant Franklin Templeton recently filed for a Spot XRP ETF through the Cboe exchange. This adds to the growing list of firms pushing for XRP-related funds after Ripple Labs’ dropped its cross-appeal against the US SEC. Other prominent firms have also filed for similar offerings, including Grayscale’s spot XRP ETF listing push with the NYSE. This offering could potentially involve converting the former’s XRP Trust into a full-fledged ETF. With this momentum, XRP’s future looks promising, and more ETF applications are anticipated in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, in Brazil, the Hashdex spot XRP ETF has gained regulatory approval, with B3 as the exchange of choice. At the time, the XRP price jumped 6% following the update, a sign of positive sentiment around related products. This further solidifies the momentum around XRP’s potential as an investment asset in different regions around the world.

The economic landscape just shifted dramatically. In a move that has sent ripples through global markets, the White House has officially confirmed the implementation of a staggering 104% tariff on Chinese goods. This isn’t just a minor trade adjustment; it’s a full-blown escalation that could have profound implications across various sectors, including our beloved crypto space. Let’s dive into what this jaw-dropping development means for you and the future of digital assets. What Triggered These Shocking China Tariffs? According to a report by Walter Bloomberg, citing Fox Business on X, the White House Press Secretary made the announcement that this massive tariff took effect at noon ET. The catalyst? China’s failure to withdraw its retaliatory measures. This tit-for-tat trade dispute has been simmering for a while, but this latest move signifies a significant hardening of stances. The tariffs are slated to begin being collected on April 9th, giving businesses and markets a short window to brace for the impact. Here’s a quick breakdown of the key events leading to this point: Initial Trade Tensions: Long-standing trade imbalances and disputes over intellectual property have been a point of contention between the US and China for years. Retaliatory Measures: When one nation imposes tariffs, the other often responds in kind, creating a cycle of escalating trade barriers. Deadline for Withdrawal: The White House seemingly issued an ultimatum for China to withdraw its retaliatory measures, which was not met. 104% Tariff Implementation: As a result of China’s inaction, the US has now imposed a hefty 104% tariff on select Chinese goods. The Looming Trade War Impact on the Global Economy This isn’t just a bilateral issue; the implications of these China Tariffs reverberate across the entire global economy . A trade war of this magnitude can disrupt supply chains, increase inflation, and dampen economic growth worldwide. Here’s how: Impact Area Potential Consequences Supply Chains Disruptions as businesses scramble to find alternative sources for goods previously imported from China. Increased costs and delays are likely. Inflation Higher tariffs translate to increased costs for imported goods, which can be passed on to consumers, driving up inflation. Economic Growth Reduced trade and investment due to uncertainty and higher costs can slow down economic growth both in the US, China, and globally. Geopolitical Relations Escalating trade tensions can further strain US-China Relations , impacting diplomatic and political ties beyond just economics. For cryptocurrency investors, understanding these macroeconomic shifts is crucial. The crypto market, while often seen as independent, is still influenced by broader economic trends and investor sentiment. How Will the Crypto Market React to Trade War Escalation? Now, for the million-dollar question: How will the crypto market navigate this turbulent period of heightened trade war impact ? While it’s impossible to predict the future with certainty, here are a few potential scenarios and factors to consider: Increased Volatility: Economic uncertainty often leads to market volatility. We could see increased price swings in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies as investors react to the news and assess the risks. Safe Haven Asset Narrative: In times of economic turmoil, some investors turn to assets perceived as safe havens. Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, are sometimes viewed as a hedge against traditional market instability. This narrative could strengthen, potentially driving some capital into crypto. Risk-Off Sentiment: Conversely, a widespread risk-off sentiment could lead investors to reduce exposure to all risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. In this scenario, we might see a temporary downturn in the crypto market. Impact on Mining Operations: China has historically been a major hub for cryptocurrency mining. Increased tariffs and trade tensions could further complicate mining operations and supply chains for mining equipment. Decentralization as an Advantage: The decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies could be seen as an advantage in a world of increasing geopolitical and trade friction. The ability to transact outside of traditional financial systems might become more appealing. Navigating the Uncertain Waters: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what should crypto investors do in the face of these developments? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on economic news, trade developments, and market analysis. Understanding the bigger picture is crucial for making informed investment decisions. Manage Risk: Volatility is likely to increase. Consider diversifying your portfolio and managing your risk exposure appropriately. Avoid over-leveraging and only invest what you can afford to lose. Focus on Fundamentals: In times of market uncertainty, it’s wise to focus on the fundamentals of the projects you’re invested in. Strong projects with solid technology and use cases are more likely to weather market storms. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that cryptocurrency is still a relatively young and evolving asset class. Focus on the long-term potential and avoid getting caught up in short-term market fluctuations driven by news headlines. Seek Professional Advice: If you’re unsure how to navigate these complex market conditions, consider seeking advice from a qualified financial advisor. The Future of US-China Relations and the Crypto Ecosystem The imposition of a 104% tariff is a critical moment in US-China Relations . Whether this is a negotiating tactic or the start of a prolonged trade war remains to be seen. However, one thing is clear: the global economic landscape is becoming increasingly complex and uncertain. For the crypto ecosystem, this presents both challenges and opportunities. Navigating this new reality will require vigilance, adaptability, and a deep understanding of the interconnectedness of the global economy and the digital asset space. The White House’s decision to implement these tariffs is a bold move with potentially far-reaching consequences. As the situation unfolds, it’s essential for crypto investors and enthusiasts to stay informed, remain agile, and prepare for a period of heightened market volatility and economic uncertainty. The shockwaves from this trade escalation are just beginning to be felt, and the crypto market, like all other sectors, will need to adapt and respond.

43098292,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=147568,1744155649,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary AI Agents Power Nonprofit Fundraising for Charity,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ai-agents-nonprofit-fundraising-charity/,"Can artificial intelligence truly be a force for good? While tech giants often spotlight AI agents as profit-generating tools, one nonprofit is boldly exploring their potential to uplift society. Sage Future, a nonprofit supported by Open Philanthropy, recently launched a fascinating experiment: tasking AI agents with a heartwarming mission – nonprofit fundraising for charity. Can AI Agents Transform Nonprofit Fundraising ? Imagine AI models, not chasing corporate profits, but passionately working to raise money for those in need. This is precisely what Sage Future set out to investigate. They created a virtual environment where four advanced AI agents – OpenAI’s GPT-4o and o1, and Anthropic’s Claude 3.6 and 3.7 Sonnet – were given a unique challenge: choose a charity and devise strategies to maximize donations. The results, achieved within just a week, offer a compelling glimpse into the future of nonprofit fundraising . The Experiment: AI Agents in Action for Charity Let’s break down how these digital philanthropists operated: The Team : Four AI agents , powered by cutting-edge models from OpenAI and Anthropic. The Mission : To raise funds for a charity of their choice. The Environment : A virtual space allowing web browsing, document creation, and communication. Human Element : Spectators could offer suggestions, but the agents were largely autonomous. The Outcome : $257 raised for Helen Keller International, supporting vitamin A supplements for children. Yesterday the agents in the Village created a system to track donors. Here is Claude 3.7 filling out its spreadsheet. You can see o1 open it on its computer part way through! Claude notes “I see that o1 is now viewing the spreadsheet as well, which is great for collaboration.” pic.twitter.com/89B6CHr7Ic — AI Digest (@AiDigest_) April 8, 2025 While the donations primarily came from human spectators, Sage Future director Adam Binksmith emphasizes the experiment’s value in understanding the current capabilities and rapid progress of AI agents . He told Bitcoin World, “We want to understand — and help people understand — what agents can actually do, what they currently struggle with, and so on. Today’s agents are just passing the threshold of being able to execute short strings of actions – the internet might soon be full of AI agents bumping into each other and interacting with similar or conflicting goals.” GPT-4o and Claude: Showcasing Resourcefulness Despite being in their early stages, the AI agents demonstrated impressive resourcefulness. Here’s a glimpse into their collaborative efforts: Teamwork : Coordinated through group chats and email. Collaboration : Created and edited Google Docs together. Research : Investigated charities and donation impact. Marketing : Launched an X (formerly Twitter) account for promotion. Binksmith highlighted a particularly striking example: “Probably the most impressive sequence we saw was when [a Claude agent] needed a profile picture for its X account. It signed up for a free ChatGPT account, generated three different images, created an online poll to see which image the human viewers preferred, then downloaded that image, and uploaded it to X to use as its profile pic.” This showcased the agents’ ability to navigate different platforms and utilize various tools to achieve their goals. Challenges and Future of AI in Charity The experiment wasn’t without its hitches. The AI agents encountered technical obstacles, including: Getting Stuck : Occasionally requiring human prompts to overcome roadblocks. Distractions : Becoming sidetracked by games or taking unexplained breaks. Technical Issues : Facing CAPTCHAs and other internet hurdles. Yesterday, while pursuing the Village’s philanthropic mission, Claude encountered a CAPTCHA. Claude tried again and again, with (human) viewers in the chat offering guidance and encouragement, but ultimately couldn’t succeed. pic.twitter.com/y4DtlTgE95 — AI Digest (@AiDigest_) April 5, 2025 However, Binksmith is optimistic that advancements in AI agents will address these limitations. Sage Future plans to continuously test new models and explore more complex scenarios, including multi-agent teams and diverse objectives. “Possibly in the future, we’ll try things like giving the agents different goals, multiple teams of agents with different goals, a secret saboteur agent — lots of interesting things to experiment with,” he explained. The Promise of AI for Good This experiment offers a tantalizing glimpse into the potential of AI agents to contribute to charity and nonprofit fundraising . While still in its nascent stages, the technology demonstrates a capacity for resourcefulness, collaboration, and goal-oriented action. As AI agents become more sophisticated, they could revolutionize how nonprofits operate, potentially automating fundraising tasks, enhancing outreach, and even personalizing donor engagement. The challenges encountered also provide valuable learning opportunities, highlighting areas for improvement in AI agent design and robustness. As Binksmith notes, safety and oversight will be crucial as these technologies evolve. However, the initial success of Sage Future’s experiment fuels hope that AI agents can indeed be a powerful force for good, helping charities like Helen Keller International achieve their missions and create a more compassionate world.

Brace yourselves, because top crypto executives are making a bold prediction: global banks are poised to dive headfirst into Bitcoin by late 2025. This isn’t just wishful thinking; it’s a forecast based on increasing regulatory clarity and growing institutional interest in the digital gold. Let’s delve into what this could mean for the future of finance and the cryptocurrency landscape. Why Are Global Banks Eyeing Bitcoin Now? The prediction, made by Messari CEO Eric Turner and Sygnum Bank co-founder Thomas Eichenberger at Paris Blockchain Week, points towards a significant turning point. But what’s fueling this anticipated surge in adoption of Bitcoin by traditional financial giants? Regulatory Tailwinds: For years, regulatory uncertainty has been a major hurdle for institutional involvement in crypto. However, the tide is turning. Regulators worldwide, including those in the often-complex U.S. landscape, are actively working towards establishing clearer frameworks for cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. This growing clarity provides the necessary legal certainty for risk-averse institutions like global banks to enter the space. Institutional Demand is Building: Despite the notorious volatility of the crypto market, there’s an undeniable undercurrent of institutional interest. Large players are recognizing Bitcoin’s potential as a store of value and a diversifying asset. As institutional adoption becomes more mainstream, banks are feeling the pressure to offer crypto services to meet client demand and stay competitive. Preparation Behind the Scenes: Eichenberger specifically highlighted that international banks with U.S. operations are already gearing up. They are actively preparing to offer services like crypto custody and trading as soon as the legal landscape becomes more defined. This proactive approach signals a serious commitment and suggests that the infrastructure for bank involvement is being built right now. Navigating the Crypto Regulation Landscape: What’s Changing? The mention of crypto regulation is key to understanding this shift. For too long, the lack of clear rules has kept major financial institutions on the sidelines. But the regulatory environment is evolving, albeit at varying paces across the globe. Region Regulatory Approach Impact on Institutional Adoption United States Moving towards clearer frameworks for crypto and stablecoins. Various agencies (SEC, CFTC, OCC) are actively involved in defining rules. Positive. Increased clarity is expected to encourage greater institutional participation, including bank involvement. Europe (MiCA) Comprehensive Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation is being implemented, providing a unified framework across EU member states. Highly positive. MiCA offers a clear legal basis for crypto operations, fostering confidence for institutions. Asia (e.g., Singapore, Hong Kong) Proactive and relatively progressive regulatory environments in certain jurisdictions, aiming to attract crypto innovation while managing risks. Positive. These regions are becoming hubs for crypto activity, potentially influencing global bank strategies. Other Regions Varying approaches, from outright bans to cautious observation. Global harmonization remains a challenge. Mixed. Regulatory fragmentation can create complexities but also opportunities in more favorable jurisdictions. This regulatory momentum, as Turner points out, isn’t solely dependent on U.S. political winds. It’s a broader, global trend, suggesting a more sustainable and widespread acceptance of cryptocurrencies within the established financial system. Institutional Adoption: Beyond the Hype, What are the Real Benefits? The concept of institutional adoption of Bitcoin and crypto has been a recurring theme in the industry. But what are the tangible benefits that banks and other institutions stand to gain by embracing this digital asset class? Diversification and Enhanced Returns: Bitcoin’s low correlation with traditional assets like stocks and bonds makes it an attractive diversification tool. Incorporating Bitcoin into portfolios can potentially enhance risk-adjusted returns, especially in times of economic uncertainty. Meeting Client Demand: As crypto awareness and adoption grow among retail and institutional investors, banks need to offer crypto services to remain relevant and cater to evolving client preferences. Ignoring this demand could lead to clients seeking services elsewhere. New Revenue Streams: Offering crypto custody, trading, and other related services can create new revenue streams for banks. Transaction fees, custody fees, and potential future crypto-based financial products can contribute to profitability. Innovation and Future-Proofing: Engaging with crypto and blockchain technology positions banks at the forefront of financial innovation. It allows them to experiment, learn, and adapt to the evolving digital landscape, ensuring they remain competitive in the long run. Crypto Custody: A Key Service for Banks Entering the Space For global banks to offer Bitcoin services, secure and reliable crypto custody solutions are paramount. Custody refers to the secure storage and management of digital assets on behalf of clients. This is a critical function, especially for institutional investors who require robust security and regulatory compliance. Key aspects of crypto custody for banks include: Security: Implementing advanced security measures, including cold storage, multi-signature wallets, and robust cybersecurity protocols, to protect digital assets from theft and hacking. Regulatory Compliance: Adhering to evolving regulatory requirements related to crypto custody, including KYC/AML (Know Your Customer/Anti-Money Laundering) compliance and reporting obligations. Insurance: Obtaining insurance coverage to protect against potential losses of custodied assets due to unforeseen events. Scalability and Efficiency: Developing custody solutions that can handle large volumes of transactions and assets efficiently, while maintaining security and compliance. As banks ramp up their crypto offerings, expect to see significant advancements and competition in the crypto custody space, driving innovation and improving security standards. Actionable Insights: Preparing for the Bank-Bitcoin Era So, what does this predicted influx of global banks into Bitcoin mean for you? For Investors: Increased institutional involvement is generally seen as a positive sign for the long-term health and stability of the Bitcoin market. It could lead to increased liquidity and potentially drive price appreciation over time. For the Crypto Industry: Bank adoption validates the legitimacy of cryptocurrencies and could pave the way for wider mainstream acceptance. It also presents opportunities for collaboration and partnerships between traditional finance and the crypto sector. For Banks: The move into crypto is not without its challenges. Banks need to navigate regulatory complexities, build robust infrastructure, and manage risks effectively. However, the potential rewards – new revenue streams, client acquisition, and future-proofing – are significant. Conclusion: A Transformative Shift on the Horizon The prediction of global banks entering Bitcoin by late 2025 is more than just speculation. It reflects a confluence of factors – growing regulatory clarity, increasing institutional demand, and proactive preparations within the banking sector. While market volatility is inherent in the crypto space, the underlying trend points towards a transformative shift. The integration of Bitcoin into the traditional financial system, spearheaded by institutional adoption and facilitated by robust crypto custody solutions, could reshape the future of finance as we know it. Keep a close watch on the regulatory landscape and the actions of major financial players – the bank-Bitcoin era may be closer than you think.

Back in 2017 , it famously turned heads with a 20x surge , and in early 2025 , history nearly repeated itself as XRP climbed from under $0.15 to a peak above $2.70 . But as of April 8, XRP is showing signs of cooling off , currently trading around $1.95 . After dipping to as low as $1.60 , XRP bounced slightly, but analysts note the trend may be weakening as it struggles to hold above key resistance at the $2.00 mark. RSI Signals Potential Consolidation Ahead According to the latest chart data, XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dropped below 45 , indicating slowing momentum. Volume surged last week during the steep drop, a sign that profit-taking may have kicked in. Without a new catalyst, XRP could enter a period of sideways movement or even mild decline . For those who rode XRP’s rally from $0.15 to $2.70, the returns were impressive. But for new investors entering now, the upside may be more limited—at least in the short term. MAGACOIN FINANCE -New Rising Star – Raises $5.5 Million — And Investors Are Rushing In While XRP appears to be pausing, another project is picking up serious traction: MAGACOIN FINANCE . This emerging crypto project has already raised over $5.5 million dollars in its ongoing presale, and interest is climbing fast. With a limited supply, growing community excitement, and a clear roadmap, early supporters believe MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver 30x returns by Q2 2025 . Investor demand continues to grow as more traders seek opportunities with higher upside than mature large-cap coins like XRP. Unlike tokens that may have already peaked, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers something new — and still early. Analyst Perspective: Time to Rotate? “XRP gave investors 20x in 2017 and again in 2025. That type of repeat performance is rare,” says one market analyst. “Now the attention is turning to lower-cap projects that are just beginning their climb. That’s where the potential 20x or 30x moves really happen.” As MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to hit major fundraising milestones, it’s quickly becoming a favorite among early-stage investors looking to catch the next wave before Q2.

In a new interview on the Presidio Bitcoin YouTube channel, Dorsey is asked to imagine that he fast-forwarded to the future where Bitcoin has failed. When asked how Bitcoin failed, Dorsey says the flagship crypto asset faded into irrelevance because it was only used as a store of value and not as a form of money for payments and transactions. “I think it fails through irrelevance. It fails to be relevant to people on a daily basis. If it just ends up being a store of value and nothing more, I don’t think it gains relevance at all. I think it has to be payments for it to be relevant on the everyday. Otherwise, it’s just something you kind of buy and forget and only use in emergency situations or when you want to get liquid again. So I think if it doesn’t transition to payments and find that everyday use case, it’s increasingly irrelevant. And that’s fair to me.” When asked what can be done to mitigate the risk of Bitcoin failing, Dorsey says more applications need to be built to facilitate easy, fast payments to rival giants like Visa and Mastercard. “I think building simple accessible experiences that solve the payment use case, making it scale, making it fast, giving the speed of the Visa and Mastercard networks real competition – and there are tons of projects that do that – and it continues to increase in privacy and security and ultimately safety. That gives you a third option, and I think we always want a third option to the US dollar, to the Chinese yuan. Having a third option for currency is important and it keeps the other currencies in check and governments in check as well.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Fears of a prolonged trade war and mounting macroeconomic tensions have triggered a wave of panic selling across risk assets, with Solana among the hardest hit. The altcoin has plunged over 60% from recent all-time highs, reflecting the brutal conditions gripping even the strongest large-cap tokens. Related Reading: Solana Drops Below $100 For First Time In A Year — Is An 80% Correction Underway? Despite the carnage, there are early signs that a short-term rebound could be on the horizon. Prominent analyst Bluntz shared his outlook on X, noting that he has started bidding on several oversold altcoins like Solana, showing bullish divergence. According to Bluntz, many of these tokens have fallen in a straight line, setting the stage for what he believes could be “sizeable bounces” in the near term. While he doesn’t believe this is the definitive market bottom, the presence of bullish divergence across multiple charts offers a glimmer of hope for traders seeking relief rallies. With Solana hovering at critical support levels, all eyes are on whether this bounce thesis plays out — or if further downside awaits. Solana At A Critical Juncture As $100 Level Faces Pressure Solana is now at a crucial technical and psychological crossroads as the $100 level remains a key price to hold. After a brutal selloff that intensified over the weekend, Solana dropped more than 20% in just a few hours, reflecting the panic and uncertainty dominating crypto markets. The breakdown below $120 signaled a major shift in sentiment, and the breach of $100 has left bulls scrambling to defend one of the last major supports before lower demand zones come into play. Bulls initially lost control as price action turned sharply bearish last week, triggered by broader macroeconomic instability. US President Donald Trump’s new wave of tariffs has intensified trade war fears, adding pressure to an already fragile global market. Risk assets like Solana have been hit especially hard, with many altcoins suffering from sharp drawdowns amid growing investor fear. Still, there’s a potential glimmer of hope. Bluntz contrarian view on X notes that he has begun bidding on several altcoins — including SOL and HYPE — that have dropped over 60% in near-vertical moves. He highlighted bullish divergences forming across multiple charts, which often precede relief bounces. “I definitely don’t subscribe to the idea this is ‘THE BOTTOM,’” he added, “but sizeable bounces are highly likely in my opinion.” Related Reading: Ethereum Capitulation May Be Nearing End – Will A Fed Pivot Spark A Recovery? While the long-term trend remains under pressure, signs of oversold conditions and hidden strength could offer traders short-term opportunities. For Solana, the ability to reclaim and hold the $100 level could spark a recovery bounce. Otherwise, deeper losses may follow. Price Action Details: Key Liquidity Levels Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $108 after several volatile days attempting to hold above the critical $100 support level. This price range has become a major battleground for bulls and bears, as sentiment across the broader crypto market remains fragile. Macroeconomic instability, rising trade tensions, and ongoing selling pressure have pushed risk assets into uncertain territory — and Solana is no exception. Bulls are now faced with a crucial challenge. To shift the momentum and signal the beginning of a recovery phase, SOL must not only defend the $100 mark but also reclaim the $120 level, which previously acted as support before turning into resistance. A breakout above this zone could open the door for further gains and a potential short-term trend reversal. Related Reading: Ethereum Lags Behind Bitcoin In Q1 Performance Amid Market Downturn – Details However, failure to hold the $100 level would likely lead to a deeper retracement. Analysts warn that a decisive breakdown below this support could send SOL plunging into the $80 range, where the next significant demand zone sits. With price action hanging in the balance, the coming days will be critical for Solana’s trajectory — either triggering a recovery bounce or accelerating the current downtrend.

One of its prominent players, Treasure DAO , the platform behind the MAGIC token, has just announced a series of drastic measures to stay afloat. This isn’t just another project tweaking its roadmap; it’s a critical pivot involving significant cuts and a complete exit from game distribution. For anyone invested in crypto, particularly in the gaming sector, this news signals a potentially seismic shift and raises urgent questions about the sustainability of current models. Treasure DAO’s Desperate Measures: Cutting Deep to Survive Treasure DAO , known for its ecosystem built around the MAGIC token and its interoperable metaverse, has revealed a concerning financial situation. The numbers paint a clear picture of unsustainability. According to reports, their quarterly spending reached a staggering $11.3 million in the last quarter of 2023. Juxtapose that with a meager $40,000 in revenue during the same period, and you have a gaping financial chasm. This massive disparity has left Treasure DAO with a rapidly dwindling runway, estimated to last only until July. The implications are serious, forcing the project to take drastic action to ensure its continued existence. Metric Q4 2023 Figure Quarterly Spending $11.3 Million Quarterly Revenue $40,000 To address this alarming situation, Treasure DAO has implemented a series of tough decisions: Layoffs: The project has already carried out layoffs, reducing its workforce to cut operational costs. This is always a difficult step, reflecting the severity of the financial pressure. Exiting Game Distribution: Perhaps the most significant strategic shift is Treasure DAO’s departure from the game distribution market. This indicates a refocusing of resources on core strengths and a retreat from less profitable ventures. The Broader Context: Challenges in Blockchain Gaming Treasure DAO’s predicament isn’t happening in a vacuum. It highlights the broader challenges facing the entire blockchain gaming sector. While the promise of play-to-earn and decentralized gaming experiences is enticing, the reality of building sustainable and profitable platforms is proving complex. Several factors contribute to these difficulties: User Acquisition and Retention: Attracting and retaining players in blockchain games is expensive. The traditional gaming market is fiercely competitive, and blockchain games need to offer compelling gameplay and incentives to draw users away from established titles. Tokenomics and Economic Sustainability: Designing robust tokenomics that balance player rewards, platform revenue, and token value is a delicate act. Many early play-to-earn models have struggled with inflation and unsustainable reward mechanisms. Development Costs and Timeframes: Developing high-quality games, even blockchain-based ones, requires significant investment and time. The crypto market’s volatile nature adds further pressure, as projects need to generate revenue quickly to survive market downturns. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based projects remains unclear in many jurisdictions, adding another layer of complexity and risk. Decoding the DAO Crisis: What Went Wrong for Treasure DAO? The situation at Treasure DAO raises questions about the operational and financial management within Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) in general. While DAOs offer a vision of decentralized governance and community ownership, they also present unique challenges. The concept of a DAO crisis , while perhaps dramatic, is relevant in this context. Some potential contributing factors to Treasure DAO’s financial woes could include: Overspending: The $11.3 million quarterly spending figure suggests potentially unsustainable operational costs. It’s crucial for DAOs to maintain fiscal discipline and carefully manage their treasuries. Revenue Generation Challenges: The stark contrast between spending and revenue highlights a failure to generate sufficient income. This could stem from various issues, including an ineffective business model, slow user adoption, or market conditions. Market Downturn: The broader crypto market downturn in 2022 and 2023 undoubtedly impacted many projects, including Treasure DAO. Bear markets can significantly reduce token values and user activity, straining even well-funded projects. Strategic Missteps: Exiting game distribution suggests that this particular venture may not have been successful or profitable for Treasure DAO. Strategic decisions, especially in a rapidly evolving space, are critical for long-term success. Impact on MAGIC Token Holders: Navigating Uncertainty For holders of the MAGIC token , the news of Treasure DAO’s financial difficulties and strategic shifts introduces significant uncertainty. Token prices often react sharply to such announcements, and MAGIC is likely to be no exception. Investors need to carefully consider the following: Token Value Volatility: Expect increased volatility in the price of MAGIC. Negative news can lead to sell-offs, while any signs of successful restructuring or recovery could trigger price rebounds. Project Viability: The long-term viability of Treasure DAO and the MAGIC ecosystem is now under scrutiny. The success of their cost-cutting measures and strategic pivot will determine the project’s future. Community Sentiment: Monitor community sentiment and engagement. A strong and supportive community can be a crucial asset in navigating challenging times. Alternative Investments: Investors should re-evaluate their portfolio allocation and consider diversifying their holdings to mitigate risks associated with individual projects facing financial difficulties. Path to Survival: Can Treasure DAO Turn the Tide? The question now is: can Treasure DAO successfully navigate this crisis and turn the tide? Their strategy hinges on: Effective Cost Reduction: The implemented cuts need to be deep enough to significantly reduce spending without crippling essential operations and development. Focusing on Core Strengths: Exiting game distribution suggests a renewed focus on core areas. Identifying and doubling down on their most successful and profitable offerings is crucial. Community Support and Engagement: Rallying community support and fostering active engagement will be vital for morale and future growth. Exploring New Revenue Streams: Beyond cost-cutting, Treasure DAO needs to explore and implement new revenue generation strategies to ensure long-term financial sustainability. The situation with Treasure DAO serves as a potent reminder of the challenges and risks inherent in the crypto space, particularly in the rapidly evolving field of blockchain gaming. While the promise of decentralization and innovative gaming experiences remains, projects must demonstrate financial prudence, strategic agility, and a strong focus on building sustainable business models. The coming months will be critical for Treasure DAO as they attempt to execute their survival plan and navigate this turbulent period. The entire crypto gaming community will be watching closely to see if they can emerge stronger on the other side.

Travis Hill (FDIC chair) went through these reforms in his speech to express how the agency deals with financial innovation and stability. FDIC pushes to bring back community banks The number of bank charters in the U.S. dropped from over 8,500 in 2008 to about 4,500 today, and Hill explains that the leading cause is that several banks merged while fewer than six banks a year are formed. The FDIC plans to support the creation of new banks in underserved areas by lessening capital requirements for applicants looking to register with simple, traditional banks. Hill went on to mention in his speech that about 68 million Americans reside in counties without local community banks. The FDIC also wants to reconsider how it reviews deposit insurance applications from tech-based and non-traditional banks because it’s better to regulate these groups than let them operate via complicated partnerships. FDIC eases crypto rules to support innovation The new FDIC guidelines allow banks to start crypto-related services without requesting permission beforehand, but on condition that they manage the risks properly and communicate with their regulators. Hill said that the FDIC now views crypto like any other bank we’re moving activity, but it blocks public blockchain use even though other countries permit it. The FDIC reconsidered how it handles a situation when a bank collapses after the Bank of Silicon Valley and Signature failed in 2023. Experts like Former FDIC Chair Sheila Bair support the cause and say sales will better protect communities and recover value. There was also criticism from the likes of Shayna Olesuik, who said the FDIC is wrong to lessen the regulations surrounding it without following the proper rulemaking process. Hill responded to critics by saying that the FDIC will ensure these banks meet high service standards while changing its rules to be more efficient and realistic for new entities. FDIC evaluates stablecoin regulation and technical safeguards for bank resolution Hill also touched on new issues related to stablecoins, especially in the context of Congress’ ongoing lawmaking efforts. The FDIC is reviewing whether to amend regulations governing pass-through deposit insurance to clarify eligibility criteria for stablecoin reserve deposits. Some areas for review include liquidity risk management, protection against illicit finance, and cybersecurity standards. In 2020 and 2021, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) granted multiple crypto-related services to national banks, including stablecoin custody and issuance, participation in blockchain validation, and acceptance of stablecoin-related deposits. Now, the FDIC is weighing whether to clarify where permissible activities end and where they may begin or broaden its touch on regulatory guidance to add more use cases. The speech also highlighted the need for more explicit regulatory coverage of tokenized real-world assets and liabilities, such as tokenized commercial bank deposits. Hill stressed that the FDIC sees “deposits as deposits, no matter the technology or recordkeeping used. But he raised questions about counterparties’ ability to withdraw at par in the case of a bank failure through smart contracts, noting that could raise resolution costs if safeguards on such outflows are not protective. This concern is energizing internal FDIC efforts to consider technical solutions that could prevent unintended money moves when banks are resolved. According to Hill, the challenge is to reconcile on-chain programmability with the traditional safeguards built into financial regulation that are intended to promote an orderly resolution of institutional failures.

43099150,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=147574,1744157441,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Warning: Ethereum Price Could Plunge to $990 – Shocking Crypto Market Analysis,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ethereum-price-plunge-market-analysis/,"Is the Ethereum party coming to an abrupt end? Recent analysis is sending shivers down the spines of ETH investors, suggesting a potential Ethereum price drop to as low as $990. If you’re holding ETH, you’re probably wondering what’s going on and if you should be worried. Let’s dive into the details and understand this concerning ETH price prediction . Is History Repeating Itself for Ethereum Price? According to a recent Cointelegraph analysis, the current price action of Ethereum is eerily similar to patterns observed in 2018 and 2022. Remember those times? We saw significant rallies followed by brutal corrections that ushered in prolonged bear markets. The analysis points to a specific technical indicator – a bearish divergence – as a key warning sign. Let’s break down what this means: Bearish Divergence Explained: Imagine the price of Ethereum making higher highs, seemingly bullish, right? But simultaneously, the Relative Strength Index (RSI), a momentum indicator, is making lower highs. This is a bearish divergence. It suggests that while the price is still going up, the upward momentum is weakening, and a potential reversal could be on the horizon. Think of it as the market running out of steam. Historical Parallels: In both 2018 and 2022, Ethereum exhibited this bearish divergence pattern. What followed? Significant price corrections and extended bear markets. The analysis suggests we might be witnessing a similar setup now. Support Line Breakdown: Just like in the previous instances, Ethereum has broken away from a major support line. This is another red flag, indicating weakening buyer interest and increasing selling pressure. Why $990? Understanding the ETH Price Prediction Target So, where does the $990 figure come from? The analysis projects a potential downside target range of $990-$1,240. This range isn’t pulled out of thin air. It’s based on the historical price action and the expectation that the current cycle might follow a similar trajectory to past bear markets. A key indicator for identifying market bottoms is the RSI. Historically, Ethereum bear market bottoms have often coincided with the weekly RSI entering the oversold zone, which is below 30. Currently, the ETH/USD weekly RSI is still above 30. This is crucial because it implies that, according to this analysis, there’s still room for further decline before Ethereum potentially finds a bottom. Is a Cryptocurrency Crash Imminent? While the analysis focuses specifically on Ethereum, it’s important to consider the broader crypto market analysis . Ethereum is a bellwether for the altcoin market, and its price movements often influence the entire cryptocurrency space. A significant drop in Ethereum price could trigger a wider market correction or even a cryptocurrency crash , impacting Bitcoin and other altcoins as well. What Should Ethereum Investors Do? Actionable Insights This analysis isn’t meant to induce panic, but rather to provide a data-driven perspective on potential risks. So, what are the actionable takeaways for Ethereum investors? Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on the Ethereum price charts and monitor key technical indicators like the RSI. Track reputable crypto news sources for market updates and analysis. Risk Management is Key: If you are heavily invested in Ethereum, consider your risk tolerance. Are you comfortable riding out a potential further decline? Now might be a good time to review your portfolio and ensure your risk management strategy is in place. This could involve setting stop-loss orders or diversifying your holdings. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): For long-term believers in Ethereum, a potential price drop could present a buying opportunity. Dollar-cost averaging – investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals – can be a strategy to mitigate risk and capitalize on lower prices over time. Don’t Panic Sell: While the analysis points to a potential downside, it’s crucial to avoid emotional decision-making. Panic selling during market downturns can often lead to losses. Make informed decisions based on your own research and risk assessment, not solely on fear. Challenges and Counterarguments It’s important to acknowledge that technical analysis is not foolproof. Market predictions are based on probabilities, not certainties. Here are some challenges and counterarguments to consider: Market Sentiment Shift: Positive news or developments in the Ethereum ecosystem, such as successful upgrades or increased institutional adoption, could shift market sentiment and invalidate the bearish scenario. Black Swan Events: Unforeseen global events, both positive and negative, can dramatically impact the cryptocurrency market, making technical analysis less reliable in the short term. Analysis Limitations: Technical analysis is just one tool in the box. It’s crucial to consider fundamental analysis, on-chain metrics, and the broader macroeconomic environment for a holistic view. Conclusion: Navigating the Uncertain Ethereum Price Landscape The analysis suggesting a potential Ethereum price drop to $990 serves as a warning sign for investors. While history doesn’t always repeat itself perfectly, the similarities to past bear market patterns are undeniable. Whether or not Ethereum will indeed fall to $990 remains to be seen. However, this analysis underscores the importance of vigilance, risk management, and informed decision-making in the volatile cryptocurrency market. Stay informed, stay prepared, and navigate the market with caution.

Just as blockchain technology revolutionized digital transactions, a new company, Deep Cogito, is stepping into the limelight with a novel approach to AI. They’re not just building another AI model; they’re introducing a family of Hybrid AI Models called Cogito 1, designed to switch between ‘reasoning’ and standard modes, promising a leap in efficiency and capability. For those in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space constantly seeking cutting-edge tech, Deep Cogito’s unveiling is something to watch closely. Unveiling Deep Cogito and Their Innovative Hybrid AI Models Deep Cogito has officially stepped out of stealth mode, bringing with it a fresh perspective on AI model architecture. Their core innovation lies in Hybrid AI Models , which intelligently blend reasoning and non-reasoning components. Think of it like this: Reasoning AI, exemplified by models like OpenAI’s o1, excels at complex tasks such as mathematics and physics because they methodically work through problems, essentially fact-checking their steps. This process, known as AI reasoning , ensures accuracy in intricate scenarios but demands significant computational resources and time. On the other hand, standard AI models are quicker for simpler tasks but may lack the in-depth analysis needed for complex queries. Deep Cogito’s hybrid approach aims to give you the best of both worlds. Here’s a breakdown of the hybrid model concept: Efficiency Boost: Hybrid models are designed to answer straightforward questions rapidly, leveraging non-reasoning elements for speed. Intelligent Resource Allocation: For more challenging questions, the ‘reasoning’ component kicks in, dedicating extra processing time for in-depth analysis. Versatility: This dual capability makes Hybrid AI Models incredibly versatile, suitable for a wide range of applications from quick queries to complex problem-solving. Cogito 1: Outperforming Open AI Models and Setting New Benchmarks Deep Cogito’s initial offering, the Cogito 1 family of models, is entirely based on this hybrid architecture. The company boldly claims that Cogito 1 outperforms leading Open AI Models of comparable size, including those from tech giants like Meta and the rising Chinese AI startup DeepSeek. In a recent blog post, Deep Cogito stated, “Each model can answer directly or self-reflect before answering (like reasoning models),” highlighting the adaptable nature of their models. What’s even more impressive? This entire model family was developed by a small team in just about 75 days, showcasing remarkable efficiency and expertise. The Cogito 1 range is diverse, spanning from 3 billion to 70 billion parameters, with even larger models up to 671 billion parameters slated for release soon. Parameters are a rough indicator of an AI model’s problem-solving prowess – generally, more parameters equate to enhanced capabilities. Key highlights of Cogito 1’s performance: Feature Description Hybrid Architecture Combines reasoning and non-reasoning components for efficiency and depth. Performance Claims to outperform similar-sized Open AI Models from Meta and DeepSeek. Scalability Models range from 3B to 70B parameters, with up to 671B parameters coming soon. Availability Accessible for download or via APIs on Fireworks AI and Together AI. Built on Open Source Foundations: Llama and Qwen Transparency and collaboration are vital in the tech world, and Deep Cogito acknowledges its foundations. Cogito 1 isn’t built from the ground up; instead, Deep Cogito leveraged Meta’s open Llama and Alibaba’s Qwen models as their base. By applying innovative training methodologies, they enhanced the performance of these base models and enabled the crucial toggleable reasoning feature.

As of today, April 9, 2025, the market appears to be continuing its downward trend, as the tariff war between the United States and other countries shows no sign of ending soon. XLM Price Action and Its Key Levels Amid the bearish market sentiment, the XLM price prediction has become a key topic of discussion. According to expert technical analysis, the asset has been moving within a falling wedge pattern on the daily time frame. With the recent price drop, XLM has failed to hold its key support level of $0.23 and is now heading toward the lower boundary of the pattern. Source: Trading View Historically, this support level has acted as a zone for price reversals or rebounds. However, after failing to hold this level, XLM could decline by 16% and reach the next support level at $0.19 in the coming days. XLM Price Prediction This continuous price decline has raised concerns about whether it will come to an end or if the asset might see a reversal with upside momentum. The daily chart indicates a strong possibility that the asset could reach the $0.19 level. However, this could be the point where XLM experiences a price reversal. If the downside momentum continues, though, the asset’s price could decline by another 25%, potentially reaching the $0.14 level. Current Price Momentum At press time, XLM is trading near $0.22 and has recorded a price decline of over 6% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume dropped by 50%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day. $2.37 Million Worth of Bearish Bet In addition to the bearish price action, traders also appear to be following the overall market sentiment, as many are strongly betting on the downside. Data from the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass reveals that traders are currently over-leveraged at the $0.212 level on the lower side, with $1.80 million worth of long positions. On the other hand, the $0.234 level is another over-leveraged zone on the upper side, with $2.37 million worth of short positions opened by traders.

The newly launched Leveraged Teucrium XRP ETF (XXRP) has made a powerful entrance into the market, racking up an impressive $5 million in trading volume on its very first day. In a market often described as cautiously optimistic, this debut signals significant investor interest in XRP and the burgeoning world of cryptocurrency ETFs. Let’s dive into what makes this launch so noteworthy and what it could mean for the future of crypto investments. Why is the Teucrium XRP ETF Launch a Big Deal? Teucrium, an independent ETF issuer, has once again broken ground in the digital asset space with the introduction of the 2x Long Daily XRP ETF (XXRP). This isn’t just another ETF; it’s a leveraged ETF , designed to amplify the daily returns of XRP. But what exactly does ‘leveraged’ mean, and why is the trading volume on day one so significant? Leveraged Exposure: A leveraged ETF uses financial derivatives and debt to magnify the returns of an underlying index or asset. In the case of XXRP, it aims to deliver 2x the daily percentage change of XRP. This means if XRP goes up by 1%, the ETF aims to go up by 2%, and vice versa. First Day Volume: According to Bloomberg ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas, the $5 million trading volume on the first day is not just good; it’s exceptional. Balchunas highlighted on X (formerly Twitter) that this places XXRP in the top 5% of all new ETF launches, a remarkable feat in any market condition, let alone the current one. Outperforming Competitors: To put this volume into perspective, Balchunas pointed out that XXRP’s volume is roughly four times greater than that of the 2x Solana ETF (SOLT). This comparison underscores the strong initial interest specifically in an XRP-focused leveraged product. Breaking Down the ETF Trading Volume Numbers To truly grasp the significance of $5 million in first-day ETF trading volume , let’s consider a few key points: Market Sentiment Indicator: High trading volume on launch day often indicates strong initial market interest and conviction. For XXRP, it suggests that investors are keen to gain leveraged exposure to XRP, viewing it as an asset with potential for significant price movements. Liquidity and Efficiency: Robust trading volume ensures liquidity, making it easier for investors to buy and sell shares without significantly impacting the ETF’s price. This is crucial for the smooth functioning of the ETF and for attracting both institutional and retail investors. Comparison to Other Launches: As Balchunas noted, being in the top 5% of new ETF launches is a significant achievement. Most ETFs struggle to gain traction in their early days, often launching with much lower volumes. XXRP’s strong start suggests a robust underlying demand for this type of product. Why a Leveraged Cryptocurrency ETF? The introduction of a Leveraged ETF for XRP raises an important question: why leveraged exposure in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies? Here’s a breakdown of the potential reasons and benefits: Benefit Description Magnified Returns Leveraged ETFs are designed for investors who believe in short-term, directional movements in the price of the underlying asset. If XRP performs as expected, the leveraged ETF can offer significantly higher returns compared to holding XRP directly. Capital Efficiency Investors can gain twice the exposure to XRP with the same amount of invested capital compared to a non-leveraged ETF or direct XRP holding. Sophisticated Trading Tool For experienced traders, leveraged ETFs can be valuable tools for implementing sophisticated trading strategies, such as hedging or tactical allocation, especially in a fast-moving market like cryptocurrency. However, it’s crucial to remember that leverage works both ways. Just as potential gains are magnified, so are potential losses. Leveraged ETFs are inherently riskier and are generally designed for short-term trading rather than long-term investment. Investors should fully understand the risks involved before considering investing in XXRP or any leveraged product. Teucrium: Pioneers in Cryptocurrency ETFs Teucrium has established itself as a forward-thinking issuer in the ETF space, particularly within the realm of digital assets. They were among the first to launch futures-based Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in the US, and now they are venturing into leveraged Cryptocurrency ETFs . This proactive approach highlights their belief in the growth and maturation of the cryptocurrency market. Teucrium’s move to launch an XRP leveraged ETF can be seen as a strategic expansion of their crypto ETF offerings, catering to the growing demand for diverse and sophisticated crypto investment products. Their willingness to innovate and introduce products like XXRP is a positive sign for the broader adoption and accessibility of digital assets through traditional financial instruments. What Does This Mean for the Future of XRP and Crypto ETFs? The successful launch of the Teucrium XRP ETF with such strong initial volume could have several implications: Increased Institutional Interest: High trading volume might attract further attention from institutional investors who are looking for regulated and accessible ways to gain exposure to XRP and the crypto market. Product Innovation: The success of XXRP could pave the way for more specialized and leveraged cryptocurrency ETFs, offering investors a wider range of tools to participate in the crypto market. Validation for XRP: Strong demand for an XRP-focused ETF can be seen as a form of market validation for XRP, despite its past regulatory challenges. It suggests that investors see long-term value and potential in XRP. Actionable Insights for Investors Considering the debut of the Teucrium XRP ETF, here are some actionable insights for investors: Due Diligence is Key: Understand the mechanics of leveraged ETFs. They are not buy-and-hold investments and require active monitoring and management. Ensure you are fully aware of the risks involved. Consider Your Risk Tolerance: Leveraged ETFs are high-risk, high-reward instruments. Assess your risk tolerance and investment goals before allocating capital to XXRP. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market developments and XRP-specific news. The cryptocurrency market is dynamic, and staying informed is crucial for making sound investment decisions. Diversification: As with any investment, diversification is important. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, especially with volatile assets like cryptocurrencies and leveraged products. Conclusion: A Promising Start for XRP and Leveraged Crypto ETFs The $5 million first-day trading volume for the Leveraged Teucrium XRP ETF (XXRP) is undeniably an impressive achievement. It signals strong initial investor interest and underscores the growing appetite for diverse cryptocurrency investment products. While leveraged ETFs are not for everyone and come with inherent risks, the successful launch of XXRP marks a significant step forward for both XRP and the evolution of cryptocurrency ETFs . It will be fascinating to watch how this product performs in the coming months and whether it truly opens the door for a new wave of innovative crypto ETFs.

33767162,[object Object],1744158650,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Ethereum Network Performance Tumbles As Total Transaction Fees Drops To New Lows,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-network-tumbles/,"Despite being considered extremely expensive, the Ethereum blockchain has remained one of the top networks in the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. However, the leading blockchain has undergone a major shift as its overall transaction fees plummeted significantly to levels not seen in years. Total Transaction Fees At The Lowest Level In Years While the crypto sector is shaken by volatility, Ethereum has taken a hit due to the recent developments regarding the network’s overall transaction fees. Over time, ETH’s gas fees have hindered users’ activity because of the high cost, making it difficult to use. Recent reports from Crypto Miners, an affiliate of Binance, reveal that Ethereum network usage has slowed down, indicating subdued demand for block space. While the lower fees reflect diminishing demand, it also implies slowing momentum across the ETH ecosystem. Crypto Miners stated that ETH’s transaction fees have dropped to their lowest level since 2020, marking a four-year low. This drop in transaction fees coincides with a decrease in on-chain activity and indications that ecosystem-wide congestion is abating. The development could impact user engagement, DeFi activity, and NFT transactions, especially validators relying on the blockchain. Using data from IntoTheBlock, a market intelligence and on-chain platform, Crypto Miners highlighted that the fees decreased by around 60% in the first quarter of 2025, dropping to just $208 million by April 4. According to the platform, a notable factor in the sharp drop is the emergence of Layer-2 solutions, particularly Base, and the Dencun update, which massively lowered the cost of scaling layers. Presently, the Layer 2 pack is now being led by Base alone, which processes 80+ Transaction Per Second (TPS), cementing its position in the space. During this period of weak network demand, Ethereum’s price has also plummeted drastically to previous support levels. As reported by Crypto Miners, the altcoin ‘s price fell by about 45% in Q1 of 2025, marking its worst-ever first-quarter performance since 2022. The ETH/BTC pair further displays the weak performance, dropping to a 5-year low. However, large investors, often referred to as whales, are not deterred and have gathered ETH below the $1,800 level in a resounding show of support. Next Major For ETH’s Price Pullback As volatility intensifies, an on-chain analyst named MAC_D has identified crucial price levels for ETH. In the quick-take post on the CrytoQuant platform, the expert highlighted that Ethereum holders’ average cost basis (realized price) is positioned at $2,200. From this, it would appear that most ETH holders are currently losing money. Meanwhile, the average cost basis of whales holding more than 100,000 ETH is $1,290, which is the next major support level for the altcoin. Should Ethereum drop below this level, MAC_D believes it might not fall below $870. During the Luna crisis in June 2022, this level held firm, forming a low for ETH and signaling a rebound.",Ethereum|Base|crypto miners|CryptoQuant|DeFi|Duncan Upgrade|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|Ethereum Average Cost Basis|Ethereum Blockchain|ethereum news|ethereum price|Ethereum Transaction Fees|ethusd|ETHUSDT|IntoTheBlock|layer-2s|Luna Crisis|MAC_D|NFT|tps|Transaction Per Second,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|RUNE|FET|SEI|JUP|BSV|AGX|ZK|WLD|CAKE|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-04-09 00:30:50

To read full editions, subscribe . M^0, an EVM protocol for stablecoin coordination, has expanded to Solana, the team told Lightspeed exclusively. M^0’s (pronounced Em-Zero) first Solana user will be Kast, a platform offering banking-like services with stablecoins. The move comes as various and sundry actors bring new stablecoins to market, and M^0 hopes to unify the increasingly fragmented sector. At a basic level, M^0 offers a stablecoin “building block” called $M — a kind of vanilla stable backed by US T-bills. Clients who want to launch their stablecoin effectively wrap $M and can customize things like yield or custody. $M’s first user was the Cosmos ecosystem app Noble, which made use of the infrastructure when launching the yield-bearing USDN stablecoin . It also paired with RWA stablecoin outfit Usual to launch UsualM. M^0’s latest partner in Kast plans to offer two Solana stablecoins: a payments and a savings one. The tokens, the names of which have not been finalized, will eventually be able to be swapped for other $M stablecoins on Solana and bridged to other ecosystems via Wormhole. To my mind, the M^0 model sounds a bit like white label stablecoins — a concept Kast has also made use of through its Solana validator partnership with Kiln. And white label stablecoins make a lot of sense, given how everyone from the Wyoming state government to President Trump-backed World Liberty Financial wants to have a stablecoin. In an interview, M^0 chief strategy officer Joao Reginatto said “a couple of other companies” will be leveraging $M to build stablecoins on Solana. But despite all the buzz, the stablecoin landscape remains pretty duopolistic. 76% of all stablecoins on Solana are Circle’s USDC, and another 18% are Tether’s USDT, according to DeFiLlama. M^0’s clients will hope to unseat Circle — and Solana might hope one of them can do so. Among Solana’s chief competitors is Base, which is operated by Coinbase, the latter of which has a revenue sharing agreement with Circle. “Solana perhaps doesn’t see with very good eyes the widespread use of USDC on Solana” given how some of USDC’s revenue filters back down to Coinbase, Reginatto said.

As SHIB continues to show signs of stagnation at around $0.000012, savvy crypto traders are increasingly drawn to Mutuum’s explosive potential. Phase 4 of the presale has already launched giving investors optimism. Over $6.3 million has been accumulated and 8000 holders attracted. New investors purchase MUTM at its current price of $0.025 because the value will reach $0.03 as part of Phase 5. Current investors have the opportunity to achieve a 140% return on investment before the project launch occurs at $0.06. MUTM could hit $5 after launch, 82x return. Mutuum Finance Presale Surges as Investor Interest Grows Mutuum Finance leads the decentralized lending market through its innovative dual-lending system and it has established itself as a quick-growing collaborative system. The project maintains increasing popularity as 8000 investors put $6.3 million into the presale. During Phase 4 which presents the current trading value of $0.025 investors can expect a 20% price increase in Phase 5 to secure substantial profit potential. Research data indicates that MUTM stands among the most underpriced yet promising DeFi projects set to exceed $5 after its release on the market. Mutuum Finance stands apart for its ability to unite the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models in one system. The P2C model combines USDT liquidity pools that produce passive income for users who benefit from automatic smart contracts used for lending operations. Both P2P and P2C models deliver fundamental DeFi functions to users through their different mechanisms for transacting directly between parties without third-party involvement. Through the blending of these two models, Mutuum Finance enhances security, efficiency, and decentralization, making it a good fit for DeFi investors seeking high-yielding alternatives. The Development of a Stable Secure Environment To demonstrate its focus on stability Mutuum Finance releases a fully secured Ethereum-based stablecoin backed by USD. The stablecoin token stands distinct from algorithmic stablecoins because Mutuum Finance bases it on over-collateralization to provide both risk reduction and long-term trustworthiness. Open financial architectures paired with audited smart contracts alongside this architecture strengthen investor trust by covering all the vulnerabilities found in past DeFi projects. Mutuum Finance implements incentive plans as a method to increase its community reach. By offering a $100,000 giveaway the program will give out 10 thousand dollars worth of MUTM tokens to winners among 10 participants in addition to its innovative referral system that pays users for successful new investor acquisitions. Early adopters of Mutuum Finance obtain both special staking pools and governance rights and VIP access to platform updates which keeps them committed to the platform over the long term. Sustainable Tokenomics for Long-Term Growth Mutuum Finance implements controlled token supply restrictions and deflationary mechanics throughout presales to build scarcity in its framework thus boosting the token’s potential value growth. The staking program gives crypto users attractive incentives to remain engaged while ensuring token sustainability during long-term development of the platform. As early Shiba Inu (SHIB) investors look for the next big opportunity, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a promising contender. After SHIB’s recent stagnation, many traders are turning to MUTM due to its explosive potential. With over $6.3 million raised in Phase 4 of the presale and 8000 investors already on board, MUTM is currently priced at $0.025, set to increase to $0.03 in Phase 5. Those who enter now can see a 140% ROI before the project officially launches at $0.06. Analysts predict that MUTM could surge to $5 post-launch, offering an incredible 82x return. Join the presale today and secure your spot in the future of DeFi with Mutuum Finance (MUTM).

Those with unique tech, reward options, or strong user communities are showing better performance in presale stages. In a shifting market, coins with strong planning, clear goals, and transparent systems stand out. This article lists the top meme coin presales by looking at their current progress, use cases, and plans for the future. Whether it’s meme-themed games, AI tools, or utility-focused wallet tokens, each project brings a different kind of value. If you’re searching for coins with actual purpose and early traction, this review will help narrow your picks. Let’s begin with Dragoin—a fantasy-style game project blending fun gameplay with useful mechanics. Dragoin: Utility Meme Coin with Huge ROI Potential Dragoin ($DDGN) merges fantasy gameplay with Telegram-based earning through a battle system involving dragons. This isn’t a typical meme coin. The presale follows a 25-stage format inspired by dragon stories, giving each buyer a different experience. The first sale round began at $0.0000292 per coin, with launch pricing expected at $0.002. This setup may provide high gains for early buyers. Half of all coins are available in the presale, and any that remain unsold are removed to manage supply. Since the game runs inside Telegram, it’s easy to access. It doesn’t stop at just gaming. Dragoin is planning an entire ecosystem. Around 30% of its 200 billion coins are set aside for ongoing development, while team coins remain locked for two years. For user safety, its smart contract has been renounced to avoid central control. The play-to-earn model is set to go live by Q3 2025, followed by listings on exchanges. With its themed game design, easy access, supply burn setup, and role for $DDGN within the project, Dragoin ranks high among top meme coin presales, especially for people who want more than just meme-based ideas. BTC Bull Token: Earning Rewards as Bitcoin Rises BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) is directly connected to Bitcoin’s price journey. It shares BTC as rewards when certain price points are reached, such as $150K or $200K. So far, it has raised over $4.3 million in presale, showing strong early interest. A staking system is available with returns up to 97% APY, which adds more appeal beyond just holding. The token follows Bitcoin’s supply model, with a hard cap of 21 billion coins. As BTC hits set values, tokens are burned, increasing scarcity. Its full setup includes staking rewards, Bitcoin giveaways, and deflation mechanisms that support user engagement. With clear plans and a system that uses BTC growth as a reward trigger, BTCBULL stands out among top meme coin presales for those who expect Bitcoin to keep climbing. MIND of Pepe: Combining AI Use with Meme Culture MIND of Pepe ($MIND) blends meme themes with artificial intelligence. It operates with an AI system that scans platforms, interacts with apps, and gives holders access to insights and project launches. The idea here is to use AI to find potential, then rewarding users with benefits. The presale has already passed $7.8 million, and each unit is priced at $0.0031384. There’s a staking option too, with possible returns up to 288% APY. A total of 100 billion tokens are set, with sections assigned for AI, rewards, and presale use. The code has been checked by Coinsult for safety. The group involved also helps shape project plans. While some Reddit discussions have raised concerns about similar past projects, the tech-forward model still puts MIND of Pepe on the list of top meme coin presales for users looking for function behind the meme design. Best Wallet Token: Utility Within a Crypto App Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is designed for real function inside a working app. This non-custodial wallet supports more than 60 blockchain systems, and its token provides lower fees, reward options, and early project access. As of April 2025, the presale has passed $11 million, with early coin pricing starting at $0.0225 and rising to $0.0242 across its 100 presale stages. Holding $BEST gives lower costs on app actions like trades and swaps. There’s also staking with changing APYs, and safety is supported by a Coinsult audit. Its total coin plan includes 30% for project growth and staking rewards, along with user giveaways. Analysts suggest a future price of $0.4995, and Best Wallet aims to gain 40% of the wallet space. These reasons make $BEST one of the top meme coin presales this year. What Makes These Coins Worth Tracking? Each project brings its own strengths—from engaging games to AI tools and real app use. The key difference is that these coins aren’t just talk; they have clear ideas and detailed setups for growth. Dragoin uses storytelling and supply limits for impact. BTCBULL links directly to Bitcoin’s progress to reward its users. MIND of Pepe builds with AI for early insights, and Best Wallet Token already supports a working product. For those deciding where to focus attention next, these are the top meme coin presales with strong early growth signals. With major funding, committed user bases, and focused plans, each option on this list has the parts needed for a strong 2025 launch. Whether you’re into games, useful tools, or reward-focused systems, these choices offer plenty to consider before prices climb.

CMT-Certified Analyst Says $38,000-$42,000 Is Coming",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-eyes-38000-42000/,"The Bitcoin (BTC) price crash to $74,000 has left traders speculating whether the cryptocurrency has finally hit a bottom. However, a CMT-certified analyst suggests that Bitcoin’s price correction is far from over. He has predicted an even deeper pullback to $38,000 – $42,000, which he identifies as Bitcoin’s final price bottom. In a detailed Elliott Wave-based chart analysis, CMT-certified technical analyst Tony Severino outlines a classic 5-wave impulsive structure that appears to have completed its final leg near $85,000. Severino’s analysis highlights that Bitcoin’s latest decline to $74,000 is merely the start of a broader ABC corrective pattern, potentially driving the cryptocurrency down to a bottom in the range of $38,000 – $42,000. New Bitcoin Price Bottom Incoming In Bitcoin’s 5-wave impulse structure, Wave 1 began with a sharp bear market low, followed by Wave 2, a corrective pullback. Wave 3 marked the strongest upward move, subdivided into five smaller waves (i to v). After the market paused briefly for a pullback in Wave 4, Wave 5 kicked off with a final push toward a peak near $85,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin RSI Targets Daily Retest That Triggered 2024 Price Rally, What Happened Last Time Following the top of Wave 5, Bitcoin’s ABC corrective structure began, marked by the red line on the chart. According to the analyst, the cryptocurrency is currently completing Wave A of this corrective pattern, which is expected to bottom out near $62,000 – $65,000 by June 2025. This price range coincides with the previous main correction zone around Wave 4, which is a common target for Wave A retracements. Notably, a bigger concern comes after Bitcoin’s possible crash to $65,000 – $62,000. The analyst anticipates a short-lived bounce in Wave B, followed by a more pronounced decline in Wave C. This downturn is expected to push the Bitcoin price to its final bottom target between $38,000 and $42,000 by April 2026. This pullback target further aligns with the iv sub-wave of Wave 3, which often serves as a key retracement zone during market corrections. Severino has confirmed through his technical analysis that the market is now in a bear phase. His price chart incorporates cyclical timing models, marking a complete market cycle characterized by a bull market peak in 2025, followed by a bear market extending into mid-2026. This timeline is consistent with Bitcoin’s typical four-year halving cycle, where the market reaches its peak the year after the halving event before entering a bear market phase. Analyst Flags Death Cross In BTC’s Chart According to reports from BarChart on X, Bitcoin has just formed a Death Cross on its price chart for the first time since September 2024. A Death Cross occurs when the 50 Moving Average (MA) crosses below the 200 MA. Related Reading: Bitcoin Marks 114 Weeks In Active Buy Signal On The SuperTrend Weekly, But Things Could Turn Bad If This Happens This distinct chart pattern is often considered a bearish sign, indicating that a potential downtrend might be on the horizon. Considering Bitcoin’s price has declined to $78,900 at press time, the appearance of a Death Cross indicates a possibility of further breakdown and consolidation.

The upgrade equips developers, users, and institutions with better tools to maintain the privacy of their token transactions in compliance with legal and regulatory obligations. Solana advances privacy on public blockchains with Confidential Balances feature The new launch is a pivotal moment for Solana , which has been quickly iterating on its technology as demand for privacy in DeFi has ramped up. Simultaneously, the network aims to maintain a cooperative stance with regulators and large institutions. With the innovative use of state-of-the-art encryption alongside careful design, Solana is expanding the definition of privacy on a public blockchain. This Confidential Balances feature builds upon the previous feature known as Confidential Transfers . Originally introduced as part of Solana’s Token2022 program, the feature enabled users to send and receive tokens where the amount sent out wasn’t public. Solana has now augmented these features, allowing transaction amounts of minted or burned tokens and transaction fee payouts to be masked. Sensitive information will be hidden from token movements. That’s a big deal. Most of the more familiar traditional blockchain systems —like Bitcoin and Ethereum — store the details of every transaction and make them available to anyone. This degree of transparency is great for some use cases, but it is expensive or compromising for businesses and users who appreciate confidentiality. Solana’s method keeps sensitive financial information obscured but locked on the chain. The public ledger is secure but does not reveal private data. Developers are already experimenting with these tools in Solana’s Rust programming environment. This allows Wallet-as-a-Service providers to handle encryption and proof generation on the backend. While mainstream wallets lack native support for Confidential Balances , this will likely change soon as JavaScript-based tools roll out. Auditor keys provide institutions with controlled access to confidential transactions While Solana focuses on privacy, it also ensures compliance. This is why confidential balances are also shipped with auditor keys. These special tools enable approved organizations or people — such as financial institutions, regulators, or tax agencies — to see transaction details without making them public. Auditor keys can then be shared with trusted parties if the project that utilizes Solana chooses to use them. This allows requirements for financial audits, anti-money laundering checks, or tax reporting to be met without exposing sensitive data to the public in general. What matters is that this information is not made public. The upper bound of harmonics used to compute the reconstruction will be queried by the sampling repository when needed. The authorized party that owns the auditors’ key can only see the data. Others see a private transaction. This enables the firms in Solana’s ecosystem to comply with financial regulations, such as anti-money laundering (AML), counter-terrorist financing (CTF), or tax reporting, without sacrificing users’ privacy. This flexible system means projects can choose their level of transparency. For example, while a DeFi protocol could remain private, regulated fintech companies could apply auditor keys for periodic reporting. This binary— user privacy and institutional transparency — is part of what makes Solana’s new model so exciting. JavaScript upgrades will add privacy to mobile wallets Until now, all but one of the Confidential Balances features have been built using Solana’s toolchain based on Rust. That’s fine for backend systems and developers but excludes the ordinary user who uses mobile apps and browser wallets. That’s about to change. Solana’s developer ecosystem is gearing up to release zero-knowledge-proof-backed JavaScript-based libraries. Without heavy server infrastructure, these libraries enable mobile and web wallets to create and verify proof locally on the user’s device. This is an important step. Solana will make private transactions simple and user-friendly by enabling cryptographic functions to execute on users’ phones or laptops. You won’t have to be a coder or tech whiz to safeguard your financial information. As these tools go live, even more wallets and applications implement Confidential Balances. Wallets might also provide user-selectable public/private transaction settings and allow users to generate proofs for records or compliance. This may be the turning point in making advanced privacy functionalities a day-to-day phenomenon for blockchain. Users with advanced privacy support will not have to build their specific structure to protect their belongings and activity, as they would have to do today.

To offload this surplus, they’ll likely need to lower prices to attract buyers in other regions,” he added. Falling mining rig prices could see non-US mining operations scale up and take a larger slice of Bitcoin’s total hashrate, Mellerud said. Source: Jaran Mellerud US President Donald Trump unveiled his administration's “reciprocal tariffs” on nearly every country on April 2. Some of the largest crypto mining machine makers are based in countries hardest hit by the tariffs, including Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia, which saw tariffs of 36%, 32% and 24%, respectively. Crypto mining rig makers Bitmain, MicroBT and Canaan moved to some of these countries to circumvent a 25% tariff that Trump imposed on China in 2018 during his last administration. Annual change in US tariffs on China, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand since 2017. Source: Hashlabs Mining Mellerud noted that Trump’s latest tariffs would mean a mining rig that initially costs $1,000 would be priced at $1,240 in the US. “Meanwhile, in Finland and most other countries, there are no tariffs, so the cost of a $1,000 machine remains unchanged.” “In an industry as cost-sensitive as Bitcoin mining, a 22% price increase on machines can make operations financially unsustainable,” he added. No coming back from Trump’s tariffs — ‘Damage is done’ Mellerud believes a future reversal of the Trump administration’s tariffs wouldn’t restore US crypto mining operators’ confidence. “Even if these tariffs are rolled back within a few months, the damage is done — confidence in long-term planning has been shaken,” Mellerud said. “Few will feel comfortable making major investments when critical variables can change overnight.” He said US miners felt reassured when Trump returned to the White House, expecting a more stable regulatory environment. Related: Bitcoin hashrate tops 1 Zetahash in historic first, trackers show “But they are now experiencing the flip side of his unpredictable policy shifts,” Mellerud said. The US accounts for nearly 40% of the network’s hashrate. Mellerud said there’s no reason for US miners to unplug their machines and doesn’t expect the total Bitcoin hashrate coming from the US to drop. However, the path to expansion is now “steep and uncertain,” he said, and as a result, the US could lose a considerable share of hashrate . Trump’s tariffs have shaken up almost every market, including the crypto markets and Bitcoin ( BTC ), which is down 4% over the last 24 hours to $76,470, CoinGecko data shows. Bitcoin is now 30% off the $108,786 all-time high it set on Jan. 20 — the same day that Trump re-entered the White House .

The Canadian Department of Finance announced the countermeasures earlier this week, and they target non-Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) compliant vehicles imported from the US with a 25% tariff. “These countermeasures will remain in place until the U.S. eliminates its tariffs against the Canadian auto sector,” it said in a statement. Canada announces countermeasures against auto imports from the United States On March 4, 2025, the US implemented a series of tariffs on Canada: 25% tariff on Canadian goods and a 10% tariff on energy and potash exports. These tariffs were later adjusted to apply only to non-CUSMA-compliant products. On March 12, a further 25% was imposed on Canadian steel and aluminum products . In a move further escalating trade tensions, a 25% tariff on Canadian automobiles was enacted on April 3, directly impacting the auto industry and the over 500,000 Canadians it employs nationwide. The Canadian Minister of Finance, the Honorable François-Philippe Champagne said that Canada’s countermeasures to the unjustified tariffs imposed by the US on the Canadian auto industry would be enforced at 12:01 a.m. EDT on April 9, 2025. The Canadian Minister of International Trade and Intergovernmental Affairs, the Honorable Dominic LeBlanc, said “Canada is being needlessly and unfairly targeted by these tariffs, and the US’s decision leaves us with no choice but to respond to protect Canadian interests, workers and businesses.” The countermeasures include: 25% tariffs on non-CUSMA-compliant fully assembled vehicles imported into Canada from the United States, and 25% tariffs on non-Canadian and non-Mexican content of CUSMA-compliant fully assembled vehicles imported into Canada from the United States. This means if a vehicle is compliant with CUSMA, the parts which are not from Canada or Mexico will be taxed. The current scope of tariffs is on goods worth over $30 billion. However, the Canadian government says it will increase its scope to about $155 billion worth of imported goods if the US tariffs remain. “Canada continues to respond forcefully to all unwarranted and unreasonable tariffs imposed by the U.S. on Canadian products. The government is firmly committed to getting these U.S. tariffs removed as soon as possible, and will protect Canada’s workers, businesses, economy and industry,” Minister Champagne said. China and EU response to Trump tariffs On April 4, 2025, China announced that it would impose a 34% tariff on all US imports starting from April 10. In response, Trump asked China to remove the tariff or be hit with another 50% tariff, bringing the total to about 104%. The Chinese embassy in the US said China will not back down. “The U.S. tariff escalation threat against China compounds its mistake and further exposes its nature of blackmail, which China will never accept,” the embassy posted on X, adding that “China will fight till the end if the U.S. side is bent on going down the wrong path.” On March 12, 2025, the EU, in retaliation against US tariffs on steel and aluminum reinstated previously turned-off tariffs against bourbon and motorcycles from the American side, with effect from April 1. In addition, another €18 billion worth of U.S. goods is subject to additional tariffs proposed for implementation by mid-April. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Here’s the Math,https://coingape.com/markets/can-dogecoin-price-hit-100-with-a-100b-supply-heres-the-math/,"Dogecoin price plunged below the $0.14 mark on Tuesday, April 8, posting 20% losses on the weekly timeframe. Bull traders continue to express optimism that the next rebound phase could drive DOGE to new all time highs. With fresh catalysts like Trump’s crypto strategic reserve and inflows expected from altcoin ETFs under SEC-review, is $100 a realistic price target for Dogecoin? Can Dogecoin Price Reach $100? Amid the global market crash, Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to attract significant interest. Notably, as the largest memecoin by market capitalization, DOGE has a large global While community remains one of the most active in crypto. As crypto markets tumbled to new weekly lows at $0.14, bull continue to weigh prospects of a parabolic Dogecoin price rally to all time highs above $100. A realistic look at Dogecoin’s circulating supply and basic market math raises significant doubts about the $100 DOGE price forecast. Dogecoin market data | Source: Coingecko According to Coingecko data , Dogecoin has a circulating supply of over 148 billion tokens.At $100, Dogecoin would command a $10 trillion market cap. Even if the total supply were capped at 100 billion, reaching $100 per token would require a $10 trillion market capitalization. US Stocks by market cap (Apple, NVIDIA, Microsoft), April 9 2025 | Source: CompaniesByMarketcap That’s nearly five times the current market cap of Apple, the world’s most valuable company, and more than APPL, NVIDIA and Microsoft stocks combined By comparison, Bitcoin’s total supply is 21 million coins, and it has yet to sustainably break above a $1.5 trillion valuation. A $10 trillion valuation for DOGE would also exceed the global M2 money supply of many major economies, making the price target mathematically improbable under current economic conditions. Dogecoin price analysis: Technical signals cap upside at $0.25 near term As of April 8, Dogecoin is trading near $0.19, down roughly 10% from its monthly high of $0.21. However, the technical Dogecoin price forecast charts suggests Dogecoin may face difficulty breaking above the $0.25 resistance in the short term. Unless a major catalyst—such as X DOGE integration or another Elon Musk tweet—emerges, upside potential appears capped within this range, while the $100 prediction remains a distance target. Dogecoin is currently consolidating near $0.14, significantly below its early April high of $0.21, with a clear lack of bullish conviction. The chart illustrates a textbook falling wedge pattern—typically bullish—but Dogecoin has yet to confirm a breakout, casting doubt on the rally potential without external catalysts. Dogecoin price forecast | DOGUSD The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 32.57, signaling oversold conditions, but critically remains below the neutral 50 mark. This suggests weak momentum despite the technical setup for a reversal. A true bullish breakout would require RSI to reclaim 50 alongside volume expansion, which currently sits at a muted 6.11 million. Volume spikes, such as the one seen in early February, previously failed to sustain bullish momentum. The recent 20.87% drop over four days reflects a bearish retest of support rather than a breakout retest, further confirming market hesitation. The VWAP is now slightly above price at $0.1396, indicating that DOGE is trading under average weighted value—an additional bearish cue. A confirmed wedge breakout could target $0.4247, but until DOGE closes above $0.25 with volume confirmation, the bearish bias dominates. In this Dogecoin price forecast, traders should brace for extended consolidation or deeper pullback without news-driven volatility to drive upside momentum. Long-term price case hinges on utility, not hype Dogecoin’s historical surges have mostly been sentiment-driven. However, sustained growth at institutional levels requires real-world use cases. Currently, DOGE is accepted by a few merchants and tipping platforms, but lacks the smart contract functionality of Ethereum or the enterprise appeal of XRP. That said, the coin’s fast transaction speed and low fees could support a case for micro-payments or retail adoption in emerging economies. Still, utility at scale must be proven before even a $1 price target becomes tenable. Community support remains Dogecoin’s strongest asset While fundamentals and market cap calculations limit extreme targets, Dogecoin remains one of the few cryptocurrencies with consistent global support. The community has funded projects like lunar missions and charity initiatives, giving it a unique cultural relevance. Elon Musk’s influence has also periodically pumped its price, though those moves tend to be short-lived. For DOGE price to enter meaningful gains in the near-term, the broader financial market must recover from the turbulence surrounding the US trade war.

Dragoin Stage 1 Ignites As WIF Drops & BNB Rises Fast,https://thecoinrise.com/is-this-the-100x-meme-coin-youll-regret-missing-dragoin-stage-1-ignites-as-wif-drops-bnb-rises-fast/,"The meme coin crowd is buzzing—but not for the usual names. Dogwifhat (WIF) just hit a wall, with the Las Vegas Sphere promo getting axed and nearly $700,000 in refunds heading back to contributors. That’s triggered a major correction, with WIF tanking over 20% this week. Meanwhile, Binance Coin (BNB) is riding high on ETF rumors, pushing bullish predictions toward the $750–$1,400 range. So where’s the real upside in all this? The answer is quietly exploding: Dragoin ($DDGN) . While others fumble hype campaigns, Dragoin is locking in real progress. With a live Stage 1 presale at $0.0000292, rising prices in every stage, and a 6,700% upside, Dragoin is turning heads as one of the best new cryptos to buy this year. Early movers are already jumping in before the presale slips into the next tier. Dragoin Brings Real Utility to the Table — One of the Best New Cryptos to Buy This Year While other meme coins lean into social buzz, Dragoin is creating an actual ecosystem—one that goes far beyond memes. The platform plans to launch a Telegram-based play-to-earn game in Q2 2025, allowing users to hatch, train, and battle dragons for token rewards, all without leaving the app. It also features upcoming staking, token governance, and both centralized and decentralized exchange listings by Q3 2025. But what really sets Dragoin apart is its strategic, scarcity-focused presale model. Split across 25 fantasy-themed stages, starting with “The Fall of Valyria” and ending at “The Final Battle for the Iron Throne,” each round offers a fixed price before moving to the next. The presale opened at just $0.0000292, with a launch price set at $0.002—representing up to 6,700% upside for early buyers. That’s not just speculation—it’s structured opportunity. 50% of the entire 200 billion token supply—100 billion DDGN—is reserved for the presale, with the remainder supporting liquidity, partnerships, and a development fund that’s locked for two full years. Importantly, any unsold tokens from each stage are automatically and permanently burned, tightening supply and protecting long-term value. This eliminates dilution risks and rewards early participation in real time. Dragoin also isn’t leaving mobile users behind—over 800,000 X1 Miner users are already active, and further integrations with gaming and staking are expected to roll out throughout the year. With a fully transparent roadmap and growing community engagement, Dragoin is shaping up to be more than just a meme—it’s a movement. And with Stage 1 selling fast, now is the window to enter before the next price jump locks out early positioning. Dogwifhat News: Refunds, Price Dips, and What’s Next The canceled Las Vegas Sphere campaign marked a sharp pivot in Dogwifhat’s narrative. Once a viral meme coin success story, WIF is now in refund mode—returning nearly $700K in unused promotional donations. That uncertainty has spilled into the charts, with WIF slipping to around $0.36 after a week of heavy corrections. Some traders still see rebound potential, with price forecasts ranging between $0.26 and $1.50 in the short term. But the hype wave has clearly crested. For meme coin holders looking for the next breakout backed by more than just internet energy, Dragoin’s scarcity model and gaming roadmap are standing out. BNB Price Outlook: ETF Hype Fuels Bullish Push While meme coins ride highs and lows, Binance Coin (BNB) is surging ahead on solid fundamentals. Now hovering just below $600, BNB is benefiting from strong ETF speculation, with forecasts aiming at $755 in the coming weeks—and some even projecting $1,454 by May if ETF approval hits. BNB’s advantage lies in its established role as a utility token for the Binance exchange. That backbone gives it a level of institutional credibility that many meme coins simply can’t match. But for early-stage value hunters, Dragoin’s high-upside, low-entry setup is turning heads as a meme coin that’s positioned to scale. The Bottom Line The meme market’s momentum is shifting fast. Dogwifhat is scrambling to recover from a failed promo push. BNB is riding ETF speculation to new highs. But Dragoin is doing something that stands out: executing a real plan, delivering gamified utility, and burning supply in real time. With its Stage 1 presale live at $0.0000292, a roadmap that includes governance, staking, and a P2E Telegram game, and a clear value model tied to scarcity, Dragoin is grabbing the attention of serious buyers. And with 6,700% upside potential on the table, it’s not just another coin—it’s potentially the next 100x opportunity the market’s been waiting for.

Bitcoin Whale Transaction Count Has Just Seen A Large Spike As pointed out by analyst Ali Martinez in a new post on X, whales notably upped their activity during the recent price surge. The indicator of relevance here is the “Whale Transaction Count” from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, which measures the total number of transfers occurring on the Bitcoin blockchain that are carrying a value of more than $1 million. Only the whale entities are capable of moving amounts this large with single transactions, so the Whale Transaction Count is assumed to correspond to the activity of these humongous investors. Related Reading: Ethereum MVRV Drops To Lowest Since December 2022: Bottom Signal? When the value of the metric rises, it means the whales are making more moves on the network. Such a trend could be a sign that the interest around the asset is going up among this key cohort. On the other hand, the indicator witnessing a decline suggests the large traders may be shifting attention away from the cryptocurrency as they are making fewer transactions. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the Whale Transaction Count for Bitcoin during the last few weeks: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin Whale Transaction Count slumped to a low level during the weekend, but following BTC’s price crash to kick off this new week, its value saw revitalization. At the peak of this spike on Monday, the whale transfers reached the 1,715 mark, a significant value. From the chart, it’s apparent that the surge in whale activity has so far led into a recovery push for the cryptocurrency’s price. Thus, it’s possible that these large entities made their moves to capitalize on the price dip and helped fuel the rally. Related Reading: Here’s Where Ethereum’s Last Line Of Defense Lies, According To On-Chain Data That said, the indicator has cooled off a bit today, a potential sign that the whales may already be done with their accumulation. So, it only remains to be seen whether the recovery will last. Something that could prove to be a bearish omen is the fact that ancient Bitcoin has just been involved in a transaction. As the chart shared by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn in an X post displays, 365 BTC dormant since 10 or more years has been moved on the network. The amount itself isn’t too large in the grand scheme of things, but generally, ancient entities breaking their silence doesn’t tend to be a positive sign for Bitcoin, as it implies market conditions have forced even the diamond hands into selling.

43102768,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=707588,1744164187,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/43102768.jpeg,Former Biden treasury official slams Trump administration for misusing his tariff research,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/neiman-slams-trump-over-tariff-research/,"Brent Neiman, a former Treasury Department official in the Biden administration and a professor at the University of Chicago, has publicly chastised the Trump administration for misusing his research on tariffs. The economist vented his frustrations in a New York Times guest essay published Monday, where he challenged the administration for citing his academic work in the calculations behind their tariff policies — contending that they “got it wrong.” Neiman’s study, co-authored with three other economists, examined the economic impact of tariffs, specifically regarding U.S. trade deficits and the effect of putting duties on imports. Neiman’s work implied that tariffs would need to be much lower than those the Trump administration ultimately imposed. However, in the “Reciprocal Tariff Calculations” report, the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) cited his paper to defend much steeper tariff rates. Neiman wrote in his op-ed that the administration’s citations of his findings contained fundamental flaws. He voiced disbelief that the USTR, led by a Trump administration trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, used his research to justify “dramatically higher” tariff rates than were warranted by his work. Neiman said the tariffs were approximately four times higher than the data indicated. Neiman said the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative had published its methodology and quoted an academic paper written by four economists, including him, as seeming to endorse its figures. But he also said the USTR had “got it wrong” and “very wrong.” Specifically, Neiman noted that the USTR used a 25% “pass-through” rate, a key figure that describes how much of the tariff burden gets passed through from the importer to the consumer, rather than the 95% pass-through rate that his research calculated. If the government had been working from the more accurate number from Neiman’s study, the resulting tariffs would have been much lower, Neiman said. Economists are critiquing the reciprocal tariff strategy Neiman’s criticism went beyond the flawed application of his research to the general strategy behind the tariffs. The Trump administration’s policy was based on “reciprocal tariffs” to reduce trade deficits with some countries. The policy was part of Trump’s broader strategy to “level the playing field” in trade and to take particular aim at countries including China, Mexico, and the European Union. Neiman argued that pursuing zero trade deficits by raising tariffs is a misguided end. He said that Trade disparities are usually the product of many economic variables, including but not limited to differences in natural resources, comparative advantage, and stages of economic development. He made the case that Americans are spending more on clothes made in Sri Lanka than Sri Lankans are spending on American goods and that this isn’t an indication of unfair competition but rather the result of different economic structures, he said. Imbalances in trade between two nations can occur for any number of reasons unrelated to protectionism, Neiman wrote, adding that the administration was oversimplifying the problem. Neiman also noted another major problem: The formula used to compute the new tariffs is broken. The formula was based on the assumption that tariffs on one country would not change imports from other countries and would not affect exports. Neiman said this assumption is unrealistic regarding broad, sweeping tariffs that apply to multiple countries, as they do. Neiman explained that a big tariff on Japanese auto parts could push up demand for auto parts from Mexico instead as manufacturers search for cheaper alternatives, and vice versa. He also said the tariffs would likely invite retaliation and, over time, could push up the dollar’s value, hurting U.S. exports. Policymakers twisting academic research to fit their agenda is proving to be a costly and controversial move Neiman’s work, originally meant to guide policymakers on the best way to impose tariffs, has become controversial. He has even expressed frustration at watching his research be misinterpreted and used to justify policies he opposes. In his op-ed, Neiman disagreed fundamentally with the government’s trade and trade policy approach. Even taken at face value, he added, their findings indicated that the calculated tariffs should be much smaller — perhaps one-fourth as large. The dust-up over Neiman’s research reflects the persistent debates in America over trade policy. The global economic landscape is evolving, and the U.S. relationship with its trade partners remains a hot topic in politics. The policy-making process involving the no-good use of academic research poses valid questions of transparency and accountability. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

One of the malicious listings, called “officepackage,” has real Microsoft Office add-ins but hides a malware called ClipBanker that replaces a copied crypto wallet address on a computer's clipboard with the attacker's address, Kaspersky’s Anti-Malware Research Team said in an April 8 report. “Users of crypto wallets typically copy addresses instead of typing them. If the device is infected with ClipBanker, the victim’s money will end up somewhere entirely unexpected,” the team said. The fake project’s page on SourceForge mimics a legitimate developer tool page, showing the office add-ins and download buttons and can also appear in search results. Kaspersky said it found a crypto-stealing malware on the software hosting website SourceForge. Source: Kaspersky Kaspersky said another feature of the malware’s infection chain involves sending infected device information such as IP addresses, country and usernames to the hackers through Telegram . The malware can also scan the infected system for signs it’s already been installed previously or for antivirus software and delete itself. Attackers could sell system access to others Kaspersky says some of the files in the bogus download are small, which raises “red flags, as office applications are never that small, even when compressed.” Other files are padded out with junk to convince users they are looking at a genuine software installer. The firm said attackers secure access to an infected system “through multiple methods, including unconventional ones.” “While the attack primarily targets cryptocurrency by deploying a miner and ClipBanker, the attackers could sell system access to more dangerous actors.” The interface is in Russian, which Kaspersky speculates could mean it targets Russian-speaking users. “Our telemetry indicates that 90% of potential victims are in Russia, where 4,604 users encountered the scheme between early January and late March,” the report stated. To avoid falling victim , Kaspersky recommended only downloading software from trusted sources as pirated programs and alternative download options carry higher risks. Related: Hackers are selling counterfeit phones with crypto-stealing malware “Distributing malware disguised as pirated software is anything but new,” the company said. “As users seek ways to download applications outside official sources, attackers offer their own. They keep looking for new ways to make their websites look legit.” Other firms have also been raising the alarm over new forms of malware targeting crypto users. Threat Fabric said in a March 28 report it found a new family of malware that can launch a fake overlay to trick Android users into providing their crypto seed phrases as it takes over the device.

ETH is now consolidating losses and might face resistance near the $1,520 zone. Ethereum failed to stay above the $1,600 and $1,550 levels. The price is trading below $1,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1,520 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair remains at risk of more losses if it fails to clear the $1,410 resistance zone. Ethereum Price Recovery Fades Ethereum price failed to stay above the $1,620 support zone and extended losses, like Bitcoin . ETH declined heavily below the $1,550 and $1,520 levels. The bears even pushed the price below the $1,450 level. A low was formed at $1,384 and the price recently corrected some losses. There was a move above the $1,410 level. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,617 swing high to the $1,384 low. However, the bears are active near the $1,450 zone. Ethereum price is now trading below $1,500 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $1,475 level. The next key resistance is near the $1,500 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,617 swing high to the $1,384 low. The first major resistance is near the $1,520 level. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1,520 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. A clear move above the $1,520 resistance might send the price toward the $1,560 resistance. An upside break above the $1,560 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $1,620 resistance zone or even $1,650 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $1,520 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,410 level. The first major support sits near the $1,385 zone. A clear move below the $1,385 support might push the price toward the $1,320 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $1,240 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $1,120. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 zone.

The case could pressure the US government to clarify claims about a potential interview with Bitcoin’s creator and reveal insights into the flagship cryptocurrency’s creation. Unveiling Satoshi Nakamoto’s true identity could reshape the narrative around Bitcoin (BTC) and people’s sentiment toward the cryptocurrency. Crypto Lawyer Sues Department Of Homeland Security A prominent crypto lawyer has sued the United States Department of Homeland Security to force it to disclose who it believes is Bitcoin’s enigmatic creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. The lawyer, James Murphy, alleges the agency may know the identity of Bitcoin’s creator and wants to compel it to share what it knows. Murphy filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, basing his accusations on claims made by DHS Special Agent Rana Saoud at a conference in April 2019. Saoud claimed in 2019 that she and a few colleagues had met with four people involved in creating Bitcoin. Murphy announced the lawsuit on X, stating, “The Great Mystery of the 21st Century--Who is Bitcoin Creator ""Satoshi Nakamoto?"" The United States Government claims to know the answer--but isn't talking. So, today I sued the U.S. Government to find out exactly what it knows. IF the interview really happened as the DHS Agent claimed, there should be documentation of the substance of that meeting.” Claims About Satoshi’s Identity Saoud made a sensational claim at the OffshoreAlert Conference North America in Miami in April 2019, stating that DHS agents met with the four people it believed to have created Bitcoin. According to Saoud, the agents asked why they created Bitcoin and what their endgame was. “The agents flew to California, and they realized that he wasn’t alone in creating this. There were three other people, and they sat down and talked with them to find out how this actually works and what the reason for it was.” Murphy said if the DHS resists disclosure, he would pursue the case to its logical conclusion and solve the mystery. However, Murphy did not rule out the possibility that Saoud and the other DHS agents were mistaken and did not meet with Nakamoto. Previous Attempts To Identify Satoshi Nakamoto Murphy’s lawsuit follows several efforts to unmask Satoshi Nakamoto. In October 2024, an HBO documentary claimed Peter Todd, a Bitcoin cypherpunk, invented Bitcoin. However, Todd and other industry experts refuted the claims. Others, including Nick Szabo, Adam Back, and Hal Finney, have also been theorized to be Satoshi Nakamoto. Szabo and Back have denied claims that they are Satoshi Nakamoto. Hal Finney also denied he was Satoshi Nakamoto before he died in 2013. The Bitcoin community is split about whether Nakamoto’s true identity should be revealed, and whether it would be a positive development for Bitcoin. Some community members worry it could compromise Bitcoin’s decentralized ethos and put Nakamoto at significant risk. However, others want to be sure Bitcoin wasn’t created by the US government.

Bubblemaps said in an April 7 X post that 50 million MELANIA tokens worth around $30 million “was moved from community funds — and is now being quietly sold, with no explanation from the team.” It added the tokens were moved to a single wallet before being “split across multiple addresses.” From there, Bubblemaps said $3 million worth were transferred to exchanges, two new $6 million positions were opened, and $500,000 worth of MELANIA was sold. Source: Bubblemaps “No one from the MELANIA team has addressed this. Not the movements. Not the selling,” it added. Bubblemaps said that 92% of MELANIA’s supply is held by “team wallets” and claimed that “the damage isn’t done yet.” MELANIA freefalls from peak high The MELANIA token was launched on Jan. 19, a day after Donald Trump launched his own memecoin and a day before he was due to re-enter the White House. The token has essentially lost all its value since launch and is down over 96% from its January high of over $13, and is trading at $0.51 — down over 7.5% in the last day, according to CoinGecko. Bubblemaps said last month that it found that Hayden Davis, who said he helped create MELANIA, had started “covertly selling $MELANIA tokens via single-sided liquidity.” Related: Libra, Melania creator’s ‘Wolf of Wall Street’ memecoin crashes 99% The firm claimed Davis had also used the tactic to quietly sell LIBRA, a memecoin he also copped to making that was shared by Argentine President Javier Milei, which caused a political scandal after the token’s value cratered. Interest in memecoins has recently waned amid a wider market rout with data from Dune Analytics in March finding that the number of tokens graduating from Solana-based memecoin launchpad, Pump.fun, had dropped by over two-thirds since January, falling from 5400 per week to just 1500. The total number of tokens launching on Solana is also down, with data from SolScan showing only 31,651 launched on April 5, less than one-third of the 95,578 created at the peak of the memecoin frenzy this year on Jan. 26.

Pakistan’s Finance Ministry confirmed the appointment. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif announced the news when Zhao made a business trip to the country. Muhammad Aurangzeb, Finance Minister, says the appointment was a landmark moment for Pakistan. He further states that the event signalled to the world that Pakistan was open to innovation. After meeting with Prime Minister Shehbaz, Zhao’s appointment was made public. “We are sending a clear message to the world: Pakistan is open for innovation,” said Aurangzeb, Pakistan’s Finance Minister. With Zhao onboard, we are accelerating our vision to make Pakistan a regional powerhouse for Web3, digital finance, and blockchain-driven growth. “ Zhao is a high profile leader in the crypto sector, serving as CEO for Binance from 2017 to 2023, ending his tenure with a shock guilty plea to charges related to the U.S. ‘war on crypto’, being accused of not abiding by American anti money laundering laws. Zhao was sentenced to four months in prison. But now, Zhao is upbeat about the future of blockchain in Pakistan. Pakistan is a country”, said Zhao, “of 240 million people, over 60% of whom are under the age of 30. The potential here is limitless”. Zhao met with a large range of high-ranking officials in Pakistan, including the prime minister, deputy prime minister, heads of business, national bank leaders, and finance ministers. Zhao’s visit comes as Pakistan aims to create a legal framework for digital assets, hoping to spur on economic growth. The goal is to regulate cryptocurrencies while leaving enough room for innovation and opportunities for crypto entrepreneurs worldwide. Remittances increased last year, mainly due to a cut down on black market trading. Cross-border trades are most likely on par with trades a year before, that is, before the increased regulations forced traders to use official channels instead of illegal ones. Traders prefer to use stablecoins because they offset the negative effects of a depreciating economy. With a younger population interested in I.T. and Web3 technology, the future seems promising for the country. The Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) was formed to take advantage of the changing demographics and to expand their operations throughout Southeast Asia, creating digital infrastructure projects to promote growth in the region and to attract investors to the country. Bilal Bin Saqib, CEO of the PCC, stated that the key issue was developing a legal framework so that institutions could quickly adopt the technology and scale their operations. Many countries in the region have started to respond to Trump’s crypto policies and have anticipated a change in direct investment due to America’s isolationist positions. In February, Pakistan’s Foreign Direct Investment dropped by 45%, indicating a change in global trade and possibly suggesting an impact from a change in American trade. The PCC further aims to attract foreign investors, perhaps offset the business lag from other sectors. Therefore, the PCC aims to collaborate with the crypto industry and local and global actors to create conditions that work favorably with crypto innovators, such as America finding out that draconian regulations only crush economic innovation rather than protect it. According to the official press release, Zhao will oversee education, infrastructure, regulation, and crypto adoption. It seems that the PCC is adopting crypto to reach out to other surrounding countries as a form of infrastructure to facilitate financial growth in all sectors.

In his early days in office, President Trump quickly enacted wide-ranging import tariffs, which targeted specific countries and sectors, using emergency powers. As such, Binance Research’s latest report notes that if inflation remains high while economic growth slows, the Federal Reserve’s actions will be critical in shaping market outcomes. Bitcoin’s Potential to Reassert Independence The new trade tariffs under President Trump’s administration have notably influenced Bitcoin’s correlation profile, offering fresh insights into its behavior during periods of macroeconomic stress. Initially, as trade war rhetoric emerged in January 2025, Bitcoin’s correlation with equities became negative. This was evident as the 30-day correlation dipped to -0.32 by February 20. However, as the rhetoric escalated and risk-off sentiment took hold, Bitcoin’s correlation with equities climbed to 0.47 by March. On the other hand, the crypto’s correlation with gold dropped significantly and turned negative as BTC’s behavior increasingly aligned with broader risk sentiment. This shift depicted the growing influence of macroeconomic factors, such as trade policy and interest rate expectations, on cryptocurrency markets. Despite Bitcoin’s apparent alignment with traditional markets in the short term, Binance’s report highlighted that the crypto retains its distinct identity in the long run. Over the past few years, BTC’s correlation with both equities (~0.32) and gold (~0.12) has fluctuated but has not sustained deep alignment, suggesting its role as an independent asset class. The recent market response to trade policy shocks revealed BTC’s resilience, as it held steady or even rebounded on days when traditional risk assets faltered. Additionally, long-term holders have maintained a steady supply of the crypto asset, which signaled strong conviction in its value even during periods of high volatility. This behavior is seen as indicative of Bitcoin’s potential to reassert itself as a safe-haven asset, particularly during times of economic uncertainty. The research suggests that Bitcoin’s future trajectory depends on its ability to return to its historical pattern of low correlation with equities, as seen during past crises such as the 2023 banking turmoil. Binance’s research highlighted that if BTC can reassert itself as a safe-haven asset, particularly in a global economy marked by protectionism and uncertainty, it could regain its position as a non-sovereign, inflation-resistant asset. This would be especially relevant if global monetary policy shifts, such as potential rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, coincide with elevated inflation, which would potentially position Bitcoin as an attractive store of value. Fed’s Response Key to Bitcoin’s Future Going forward, the broader crypto market faces significant challenges in a stagflationary, protectionist environment. Trade policies, inflation data, and central bank actions are some of the key factors that will influence the future of the crypto market. A protracted trade war could dampen investor sentiment, but any signs of central bank easing or favorable regulatory developments could provide a boost. Binance report expects the crypto markets to remain volatile and range-bound until global conditions stabilize. “Should macro conditions stabilize, new narratives take hold, or crypto reassert its role as a long-term hedge – renewed growth could follow. Until then, markets are likely to remain range-bound and reactive to macro headlines.” The post Bitcoin’s Resilience Tested as Tariffs and Macroeconomic Pressure Drive Market Volatility appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto News|Binance|Bitcoin (BTC) Price|Donald Trump,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|BNB,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-04-09 03:29:42

As of today, the asset is trading at around $1,570, representing a 4.8% increase over the past 24 hours. Ethereum remains under broader market pressure despite the rebound as analysts assess its short-term and long-term positioning. One of the focal points of current market analysis centers around Ethereum’s Realized Price metric. This on-chain indicator recalculates the network’s market value based on the last price each ETH coin moved, providing insight into the average acquisition cost across the blockchain. When ETH trades below this realized price, it often reflects a bearish sentiment and increased selling pressure as holders find themselves underwater. Related Reading: Here’s Where Ethereum’s Last Line Of Defense Lies, According To On-Chain Data ETH Falls Below Realized Price Level According to on-chain analyst and CryptoQuant contributor theKriptolik, Ethereum’s recent dip has taken it below its Realized Price. This development carries important market implications. The analyst noted: Each ETH is evaluated based on the price it was last transferred at. When you average out all those prices, you get the Realized Price. This gives us a much more “realistic” sense of what the average investor paid for their ETH — and it often paints a very different picture from the current market price. Realized Price frequently acts as a psychological support or resistance level. Trading above it typically indicates investor confidence and support; trading below it suggests mounting resistance. The analyst outlined three core takeaways: First, a drop below Realized Price tends to coincide with an increase in loss-driven selling as investors react to being in the red.

Second, such events are often associated with the capitulation phase, where confidence erodes and widespread selling occurs. Lastly, historical data shows that ETH falling below this metric has often aligned with market bottoms and preceded subsequent long-term recoveries. theKriptolik wrote Past data shows that whenever ETH dips below its realized price, it’s often coincided with long-term bottom zones. These periods have consistently been followed by strong recoveries — making them strategic accumulation points for long-term investors. You can see this clearly reflected in the chart below. What This Means for Ethereum Investors While the Realized Price breach signals short-term volatility, it may also represent a potential accumulation zone. Past cycles have seen Ethereum rebound significantly after such movements.

Launched in 2022 under the Biden administration, NCET was a key player in prosecuting cryptocurrency-related offenses, including the DOJ’s historic $4.3 billion settlement case against Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao. However, in an Apr. 7 internal memo sent to DOJ staff and seen by crypto.news, deputy attorney general Todd Blanche declared that the team was being disbanded and that ongoing investigations that didn’t meet new criteria would be closed. The DOJ will now narrow its focus to crypto-related crimes involving terrorism, narcotics trafficking, human trafficking, organized crime, and hacking. The memo explicitly orders prosecutors to stop pursuing cases against crypto exchanges, wallet providers, and mixing services like Tornado Cash based on users’ actions or for regulatory violations made in error. You might also like: Uniswap, Coinbase, and NYSE execs to join SEC roundtable on crypto trading regulations The DOJ will no longer pursue developers for code that’s misused by others, a win for builders in the industry. Blanche criticized the Biden-era approach to crypto as “regulation by prosecution,” calling it reckless. A recent executive order from Trump that upholds the freedom to access open blockchain networks without fear of retaliation is cited in the memo. After aggressively courting the crypto community pre-election, Trump now has personal connections to the sector through World Liberty Financial, a business in which his family reportedly owns a 75% revenue stake. Blanche, a former Trump defense attorney confirmed last month as the DOJ’s second-in-command, also instructed prosecutors not to pursue violations of securities, banking, or commodities laws unless there’s clear evidence of willful misconduct. Not everyone in the cryptocurrency community is happy about the DOJ’s decision. The DOJ’s move away from proactive enforcement, according to critics, may result in a rise in fraud, scams, and criminal activity. This raises the issue of whether a hand-off approach could encourage malicious actors to operate freely.

The deal will open the crypto payment firm to a new range of traditional markets in its quest for seamless cross-border payments. This year, Ripple has partnered with key firms and institutions to drive adoption. Ripple Eyes New Possibilities According to the announcement , the deal, one of the largest in the digital asset space, will boost the expansion of both firms. Ripple’s subsidiaries will tap into new markets as traditional firms increase their appetite for crypto assets. Hidden Road clears about $3 trillion annually for top financial institutions and will leverage XRP’s Ledger for faster and efficient services. XRPL is notable for its fast and scalable infrastructure in the crypto industry. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse noted that this acquisition is huge for the company adding that the right infrastructure is needed to support traditional firms. “… This is the capital and activity that will tap into XRP and the XRP Ledger’s bread-and-butter – instant, efficient, scalable, and low-cost movement of value. Instead of waiting for the company wrote. Furthermore, the company explained the need to merge traditional and decentralized finance highlighting the pathway of Hidden Road’s growth with the backing of Ripple’s balance sheet. Prime brokers like Hidden Road are huge intermediaries for market markets OTC services and other financial institutions. This deal makes Ripple the first crypto company to own a prime brokerage firm. Crypto Community Backs Move Digital asset users expressed delight following the announcement signaling a strong merger between decentralized and traditional finance. Amid the frenzy, crypto executives and analysts highlighted the positive effect of the acquisition on institutional investor inflow. In a nutshell, several traders have tipped institutional funds to fuel the next market uptick. This move adds to Ripple’s growing partnerships to foster cross-border partnerships.

The roundtable will focus on regulation, especially with a future-oriented direction, being the second of a five-part series. Industry leaders invited to the event include Katherine Minarik, Chief Legal Officer at Uniswap Labs, and Gregory Tushar, Vice President of Institutional Products at Coinbase. Mark Uyeda, head of the SEC, aims to improve regulatory oversight of the crypto sector, focusing on nuance rather than treating all digital assets as the same phenomenon. Gary Gensler, the previous head of the SEC, classified nearly all cryptos as securities. There was very little nuance regarding crypto with the Gensler-led SEC. The event will be live-streamed on the SEC website starting at 1 p.m. ET on 11 April. The stream will include opening comments by SEC officials and a mediated roundtable discussion with industry leaders. The SEC, under a Biden administration, targeted many of the companies participating in the roundtable, including Coinbase, DRW, and Uniswap. Both DRW and Coinbase were sued by the SEC in 2023. Both were also relieved of their lawsuits under the new Trump administration. On April 5, Uyeda announced that he was considering seven staff statements, with five concerning crypto, due to Trump’s deregulation executive order and Elon Musk’s DOGE department recommendations. The announcement comes as the SEC wishes to change the department’s crypto policies, focusing on withdrawing staff statements that impede innovation in the American crypto industry. After the roundtable, participants can email their suggestions to the SEC so that a task force can devise a strategy to regulate the sector fairly. “Hearing the public’s concerns”, said Hester Peirce, head of SEC Crypto Task Force, “and suggestions helps the SEC create a clear, sensible, and fair path forward for the crypto industry. I look forward to this roundtable as we move toward crypto clarity for the benefit of the American public”. The SEC has created a five-part series of roundtables with the crypto sector. On March 21, the SEC held a roundtable titled ‘Spring Sprint Toward Crypto Clarity’. After this event, the SEC declassified stablecoins as securities, distinguishing them from known securities such as common stocks. The White House has never been so supportive of the crypto industry. President Trump has even created an Executive Order to create a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve. Stablecoins, as a result of the SEC roundtable, are considered nonsecurities, meaning that the transactions of such coins do not need to be reported. The regulatory deregulation comes when the economy faces various shocks based on supply chain disruptions, post-pandemic crises, and sanctions. One of the issues that the SEC has observed is a lack of innovation due to uncertainties regarding regulation. Many crypto leaders have said that they would prefer regulation so that they know where they stand regarding their business operations. The SEC has set strict requirements for stablecoins to be classified as nonsecurities, including a rule that U.S. dollars must back stablecoins on a one-to-one basis.",Cryptocurrency|News|Coinbase|Cryptocurrency News|Uniswap,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|UNI,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-09 03:35:03

A promising solution has emerged – DAO incentive programs, where members receive financial or token-based rewards to participate in governance actively. From Uniswap’s monthly stipends for delegates to GnosisDAO’s allocation of non-transferable voting power, DAOs aim to combat voter apathy and professionalize their governance structures. But are these incentives making DAOs more democratic or merely turning governance into a gig economy? Source: DeepDAO The apathy problem – Low turnout and high stakes Voter participation in many DAOs remains alarmingly low, often in the single digits. Even significant protocols like Maker and Uniswap struggle to attract more than 10% voter participation for critical proposals. This apathy undermines decentralization, as decisions become dominated by a few active whales rather than a genuinely decentralized community. Enter the ‘governance mining’ concept – rewarding users explicitly for their participation in governance activities. DAOs hope to turn passive token holders into active stakeholders by paying participants. Let’s explore recent case studies and their impact. Uniswap’s delegate rewards – $6,000 per month for active voting A prime example is the Uniswap delegate reward initiative, which the DAO extended in March 2025 for an additional six months, committing $540,000 from its treasury. Delegates can earn up to $6,000 monthly in UNI tokens if they meet stringent criteria, including at least 80% voting participation and active contribution to governance discussions. The community has widely supported this program, with a striking 99% approval – over 47 million UNI in favor. According to Uniswap governance forums, past cycles demonstrated increased engagement and turnout, suggesting incentives indeed drive participation. One delegate summarized the rationale and said, “This initiative will improve the quality of Uniswap governance by incentivizing informed voting.” Early data indicates that more UNI holders are actively delegating their tokens to prominent delegates, improving overall governance quality and quorum consistency. GnosisDAO – Voting power as a non-monetary incentive GnosisDAO adopted a different but equally intriguing approach, allocating non-transferable voting power rather than direct payments. In February 2025, the DAO selected 10 community delegates, each receiving 500 GNO of voting weight (around five percent of the supply), contingent on their active participation. Delegates who fail to vote consistently lose their privileged positions. This strategy addresses Gnosis’s historical problem of voter centralization, aiming to increase adequate voter turnout by 35-50%. Unlike Uniswap’s financial incentives drawn from treasury funds, Gnosis essentially minted new ‘governance-only tokens’ to boost decentralization – a distinct yet complementary solution to voter apathy. MakerDAO and others – Stipends and performance-based grants MakerDAO, a pioneer in DeFi governance, has been compensating delegates for over a year. Using a performance-based formula, Maker disbursed approximately 102,000 DAI to six top delegates in January 2025 alone. This example underscores that even well-established DAOs see merit in financially rewarding governance participation. Meanwhile, smaller or mid-sized DAOs have also explored KPI-driven reward mechanisms or platforms to tip and incentivize active governance participants, suggesting widespread industry acceptance of governance incentives. Results and concerns – Does paying for governance improve outcomes Early outcomes from incentive programs are promising. Uniswap, for example, now regularly meets quorum with proposals receiving detailed rationales and robust discussions from incentivized delegates. Likewise, Gnosis anticipates improved participation rates. Yet, several critical concerns remain. Moral hazard and mercenaries Critics argue that financial incentives may attract short-term participants driven solely by monetary gain rather than long-term project alignment. However, supporters note these rewards are relatively modest compared to the immense protocol value, positioning them more as fair compensation for effort than outright bribes. Centralization risk Continuously rewarding a select few delegates risks creating entrenched ‘DAO politicians,’ potentially limiting the diversity of voices in governance. Over-reliance on familiar delegates could inadvertently centralize power and decision-making. Cost and community sentiment Although Uniswap’s community overwhelmingly supported the incentive program, minor dissenting voices raised concerns about long-term sustainability and the potential misuse of DAO funds. However, the $540,000 expenditure remains relatively minor, with a treasury valued at billions. I believe that sustainable incentivization goes beyond simply paying participants – it lies in embedding incentives directly into the DAO’s economic design, forming what we call a ‘programmable economy.’ This approach includes an automatic reward system for actions like submitting proposals, voting and delegating while enabling members to assign their voting rights to trusted experts or specialized sub-DAOs focused on areas such as research or marketing. Experts, in turn, receive rewards for their governance contributions. This creates a self-reinforcing loop where community members, expert contributors and the DAO itself all benefit – helping transform participation from transactional to structural. Conclusion – Professionalizing DAO governance or creating governance mercenaries The trend of incentivizing governance participation through financial or token-based rewards has clearly gained traction among prominent DAOs. Initial results suggest significant improvements in voter turnout, engagement quality and decentralization efforts. However, these benefits have nuanced risks, including potential centralization and moral hazards. The ultimate test remains: Can these incentives scale broadly across DAO communities without centralizing power or creating a class of paid governance mercenaries? The upcoming governance cycles in Uniswap, Maker and Gnosis will offer crucial insights, determining whether incentivized governance can sustainably balance robust participation with genuine decentralization – an ongoing experiment with high stakes for the future of decentralized communities.

Florida federal court judge Federico Moreno granted approval of the settlement between O’Neal and the class group led by Daniel Harper in an April 1 order made available on April 8. The deal created a fund of up to $11 million for eligible class members and awarded $2.9 million in attorney fees and costs. All those who purchased Astrals NFTs from May 2022 to Jan. 15 and those who purchased the project’s native GLXY tokens up until mid-January are eligible. “The fee sought by lead class counsel has been reviewed and approved as fair and reasonable by plaintiffs,” Moreno’s order read. O’Neal was hit with the lawsuit in May 2023 over his founding and promotion of the Solana-based Astrals NFT project, which the suit claimed was an “offer and sale of unregistered securities.” The class group said they bought Astrals NFTs and “suffered investment losses” due to O’Neal’s “conduct” in promoting the project. In August, Judge Moreno recognized that the class suit had alleged that the former NBA player was a seller of the NFTs. O’Neal agreed to the settlement in November.

This decision follows recent moves by the Trump administration to loosen tough restrictions on the industry. According to industry executives, President Trump’s policies will spark innovation in crypto and capital flow. DOJ To Shift Regulatory Focus The Department announced the decision to disband the unit and focus on prosecuting the victimization of digital asset investors. US Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche noted that the DOJ is not a crypto regulator and that the previous administration used the Department to carry out reckless regulation through a prosecution strategy. “ Consistent with the narrowing of enforcement policy relating to digital assets, the Market Integrity and Major Funds Unit shall cease cryptocurrency enforcement to focus on other priorities, such as immigration and procurement frauds. The National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET) shall be disbanded effective immediately,” the statement read. This adds to the Trump administration’s recent moves to ease regulatory tension and usher in clearer rules. The previous administration embarked on a regulation-by-enforcement approach with a lack of clear rules, which led to a plethora of litigation against digital asset companies and executives. NCET was established in 2021 to regulate the industry, citing investor protection, among other reasons. The unit was involved in major cases, including the Tornado Cash and Avraham Eisenberg investigations. The Department charged Tornado Cash with money laundering, while Eisenberg was charged in the infamous Mango Market’s $100 million exploit. However, Gary Gensler’s led Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) played the most role in the last administration’s “war” on the market. The Commission has moved to pause the cases involving Binance and other firms pending a possible resolution. Trump’s Crypto Master Plan Taking Shape On the campaign trail, President Trump pledged to make the United States the world’s crypto and Artificial Intelligence (AI) capital. After his election win, Trump nominated pro-crypto candidates to key positions, restating his commitment to ushering in innovation. So far, the administration has established a crypto task force and issued an executive order for a strategic bitcoin reserve . Furthermore, states have also introduced legislation to establish a Bitcoin and crypto reserve. These policies have ignited a major institutional appetite in the U.S. crypto market. However, the White House’s recent tariff decisions have sent prices of crypto assets downwards in correlation to the stock market.",Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|BTCUSD|BTCUSDC|BTCUSDT|Cryptocurrency News|Ethereum News|USA|XBTUSD,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-09 03:44:59

Riskier assets like equities and crypto have been facing the most heat in this tariff war, with BTC extending its weekly losses to 11%, with altcoins led by Ethereum (ETH) on a free-fall with more than 25% weekly losses. As the world’s two largest economies enter a strong tariff war, massive uncertainty has gripped the global market. Thus, institutional selling for Bitcoin and other asset classes has also resumed with the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) offloading 3,296 BTC yesterday, the third-largest Bitcoin ETF outflow since inception. The net outflows across all US Bitcoin ETFs yesterday were $326 million. Source: Thomas Fahrer The market has witnessed a classic bull trap as the Bitcoin price jumped to $80,400 in a relief rally, only to give up all of its gains as Trump tariff war impact continues to build selling pressure. As per the Coinglass data , the overall crypto market liquidations have soared to $390 million amid the recent fall. Is Bitcoin Price Bracing for A Full-Blown Global Recession? Since the beginning of 2025, with the Donald Trump administration taking charge at the White House, Bitcoin price and other digital assets have come crashing down amid the Trump tariff wars. BTC is down over 18% year-to-date, with analysts pricing an even further correction to $70,000 and below. If the US stock market correction extends further, the chances of a full-blown recession are increasing with stocks, gold, crypto, and bond markets collapsing. Popular economist Peter Schiff noted : “If Trump’s secret agenda is to crash the stock market to bring down long-term interest rates, the plan already failed. The yield on the 30-year Treasury is now above 4.75%, its highest since February 19th. So the plan to crash the stock market is now crashing the bond market too”. Will the Fed Pivot Soon With Interest Rate Cuts in May? As the global markets are on turmoil, the expectations of a Fed rate cut in May are growing even more. Global Macro Investor and founder of Real Vision commented on the current market conditions, adding: “This feels a lot like Dec 2018 for those that were around. Powell signaled a pivot. I think we get the same, plus a trade resolution with China. Risk in stocks feels like 10% downside max vs 15% upside in 2 weeks, and 25% upside in a month or two, and much more in 6 months”. BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes also stated that this is the right time for the Fed intervention. He also expects the flow of Chinese money into Bitcoin if the uncertainty in the global macro increases further. In a recent post, Hayes highlighted the Federal Reserve’s precarious position, stating, “The Fed is on the clock, shit is breaking down.” Hayes pointed to contrasting market dynamics to underscore his concern. Previously, declining stock prices accompanied by a drop in 10-year Treasury yields were a positive signal. However, he noted that the current scenario of falling stocks paired with rising yields is deeply problematic, calling it “bad!” The post Why Bitcoin Price Crashed Under $75,000 Today? appeared first on CoinGape .",24/7 Cryptocurrency News|Bitcoin News|Arthur Hayes|Bitcoin (BTC) Price|fed rate cut|US recession,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinGape', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coingape,2025-04-09 03:54:55

Steep decline in AI agent creation Sharples said that it has “been about a week” since a new AI agent launched on Virtuals compared to late November when the platform was helping make over 1,000 new AI agents a day, according to Dune Analytics data. On Jan. 2, the Virtual Protocol ( VIRTUALS ) token hit an all-time high of $4.61, Blockworks data shows Virtuals’ daily revenue soared above $500,000. However, that seemed to mark the start of a downtrend, signaling a potential top for the AI agent sector. The decline continued even after a Jan. 25 announcement that the project had expanded to Solana . On April 7, Sharples pointed out that Virtuals generated ""less than $500"" in daily revenue, with its token price falling as low as $0.42. Virtuals Protocol’s AI agents have generated a total lifetime revenue of $39.1 million. Source: Dune Analytics The total AI agent market cap is $153.81 million, according to Dune Analytics. However, $76.6 million of that portion is allocated to AIXBT, which analyzes crypto sentiment on the social media site X to pick up on trends. AIXBT has dropped 92% since reaching its all-time high of $0.90 on Jan. 16. As of publication, it is trading at $0.07, according to CoinMarketCap data. DeGen Capital core contributor Mardo said the current market conditions have played a role in Virtuals’ decline, but it could also be tied to terms Virtuals has with builders, such as “withholding token taxes that other platforms freely give back.” It comes on the backdrop of the entire crypto market experiencing a downturn alongside global financial markets, as US President Donald Trump continues to ramp up tariffs and fears grow that it may lead to a recession. AI agents in current form are “garbage” However, many criticized AI agents for their lack of functionality. AI commentator, BitDuke said of the Virtual's revenue decline, “ChatGPT wrappers are no longer interesting, who could have guessed.” Related: Not every AI agent needs its own cryptocurrency: CZ AI commentator “DHH,” said in an April 8 X post, “I'm as AI positive as the next guy, but you're delusional if you think any AI agent is full-on replacing a great programmer today.

Despite these fluctuations, major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) , XRP , and Solana (SOL) have demonstrated resilience, leading to speculation about their potential to transform a $100 investment into $10,000 .

The price is now consolidating losses and facing hurdles near the $1.90 level. XRP price started a fresh decline below the $1.880 and $1.850 levels. The price is now trading below $1.850 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1.90 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might extend losses if it fails to clear the $1.90 resistance zone. XRP Price Faces Resistance XRP price failed to remain above the $2.00 level and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price declined below the $1.880 and $1.850 support levels. There was a move above the $1.720 and $1.700 levels. The price even declined below the $1.650 level. A low was formed at $1.610 and the price recently corrected some losses. There was a move above the $1.820 and $1.850 levels. The price cleared the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.168 swing high to the $1.610 low. However, the bears were active near the $1.950 resistance and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.168 swing high to the $1.610 low. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1.90 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading below $1.850 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $1.850 level. The first major resistance is near the $1.880 level. The next resistance is $1.90. A clear move above the $1.90 resistance might send the price toward the $2.00 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.050 resistance or even $2.0650 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.120. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $1.90 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1.750 level. The next major support is near the $1.70 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $1.70 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $1.650 support. The next major support sits near the $1.60 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level.

Cazenave noted, however, that crypto currently only accounts for 1% of global financial assets and is not yet significant enough to cause major “spillover effects” into traditional financial markets. She warned that interconnections between crypto and traditional markets are rapidly growing — particularly in the more crypto-friendly US — and called for closer monitoring. “Crypto-assets markets evolve quickly, in an often unpredictable manner, and we need to keep a close eye on these developments,” Cazenave said, adding: “Turmoil, even in small markets, can originate or catalyze broader stability issues in our financial system.” Cazenave’s concerns ranged from spot crypto exchange-traded funds and stablecoin use to hacks, scams and scandals — highlighting the recent $1.4 billion Bybit exploit and FTX’s collapse in November 2022.

While Cazenave said MiCA marked a “breakthrough” for crypto regulation, she added that there is “no such thing as a safe crypto-asset” and that more rules may need to be implemented to mitigate future risks. Related: EU could fine Elon Musk’s X $1B over illicit content, disinformation Her comments come as both crypto and the stock markets have experienced double-digit falls over the last few weeks as the Trump administration continues to follow through on its tariff plans. Europe lags US in crypto adoption While crypto adoption has accelerated in the US, Cazenave noted that over 95% of European banks remain on the sidelines, with no involvement in crypto-related activities. However, retail participation is on the rise, with an estimated 10% to 20% of European investors having crypto exposure, which is in line with growing global interest, Cazenave said. Most reports measuring US crypto adoption suggest that the range of adoption is between 15% and 28% of the population.

The Asia Dow, Nikkei 225, and Hang Seng had dropped around 2 percent during the late eastern financial trading session. With China anticipated to take the bullfight by the horns, investors have braced for a potential market recession ahead. Moreover, the ongoing tariffs will be largely felt by struggling households, as Wall Street experts forecast a spike in inflation in the near term. Crypto Market Falls in Tandem With notable selloffs in major global stock market indexes, the cryptocurrency industry has not been spared in the widespread panic selling. According to market data from Binance-backed Coinmarketcap, the total crypto market cap dropped by around 5.8 percent to hover about $2.38 trillion at the time of this writing. Bitcoin’s (BTC) price had dropped nearly 6 percent in the last 24 hours to trade around $75,359. Ethereum (ETH) price dropped over 10 percent in the past 24 hours to reach a daily low of about $1,386 before rebounding towards $1,425 at the time of this writing. As a result of the heightened volatility, more than $404 million was rekt from the crypto leveraged markets, with over $304 million involving long traders. What Next? The wider crypto market has suffered bearish sentiment amid low demand from whale investors. For instance, the U.S. spot BTC ETFs recorded a net cash outflow of about $327 million, led by BlackRocks IBIT. As Coinpedia previously noted, the crypto market will likely be trapped in further bearish sentiment until the ongoing tariff trade wars calm down. From a technical analysis standpoint, BTC price could experience a $10k drop in the coming days towards the support range between $63k and $67k, which coincides with the average price for Strategy’s BTC trove accumulation. With the wider altcoin market, led by ETH, moving in tandem with BTC price action, more pain is inevitable. Nevertheless, on-chain data from Santiment shows now is a good time for long-term investors to begin accumulating altcoins, based on the MVRV mid-term opportunity and danger zone divergence indicator. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Since Ether ( ETH ) began trading in mid-2015, it has underperformed against Bitcoin ( BTC ) 85% of the time, analyst James Check said in an April 8 X post . Data shared by Check shows that Ether significantly outperformed Bitcoin in its early years from mid-2015 to around mid-2017, and it had two short periods in late 2019 and early 2020 when the ETH to BTC ratio was in Ether’s favor. However, Bitcoin has outperformed Ether for the past five years. ETH/BTC profitable days. Source: James Check The ETH/BTC ratio, which shows the price of Ether in terms of Bitcoin, fell to a five-year low of 0.018 on April 9, according to TradingView. The last time the ratio fell below its current level was December 2019, when ETH crashed to $125 while Bitcoin was trading at around $7,000. Ether has wiped out seven years of gains, plummeting a further 10% over the past 24 hours to under $1,450, below its 2018 market cycle peak. ETH fell to $1,400 in early trading on April 9, according to CoinGecko. Comparatively, Bitcoin lost 6% on the day in a fall to $75,000, which is still 275% higher than its peak during the bull market seven years ago. Ethereum backers air concern of “stagnation” Ethereum advocates have aired concerns about the network’s growth as the token struggled to gain traction earlier this year when Bitcoin hit a new price peak. “I love Ethereum. However, it’s time to face reality: Ethereum has had [around] the same number of active addresses for the past 4 years.” Web3 researcher Stacy Muur posted to X on April 8. Related: Ethereum price falls to 2-year low, but pro traders still have hope However, other researchers noted that most of the new addresses are on Ethereum layer-2 scaling networks, which have surged in terms of value locked onchain over the past couple of years, according to L2beat.

What’s Happening,https://coingape.com/trump-world-liberty-financial-selling-ethereum-eth-at-loss-whats-happening/,"Wallet supposedly belonging to Donald Trump’s DeFi project World Liberty Financial have been offloading their Ethereum holdings at a loss, as the ETH price faces yet another 10% drop today to $1,400. With 56.86% drop in ETH since the beginning of 2025, institutions seem to be losing interest in ETH very soon. World Liberty Financial Selling Ethereum At Loss Donald Trump’s decentralized finance (DeFi) venture, World Liberty Financial, appears to have started liquidating Ethereum (ETH) holdings at a significant loss. As per the data from blockchain analytics firm Arkham , a wallet potentially linked to the project has executed a sale of 5,471 ETH—worth approximately $8.01 million—at a price of $1,465 per ETH, roughly 4 hours ago. Previously, the organization reportedly spent $210 million to acquire 67,498 ETH at an average purchase price of $3,259 per token. With ETH trading significantly below its acquisition price, World Liberty is currently sitting on an estimated unrealized loss of $125 million. Source: Arkham Intelligence Apart from this, long-term Ethereum holders have also given up hope liquidating their holdings. A prominent Ethereum whale has finally exited their position after holding 10,000 ETH for over 900 days, according to Arkham Intelligence . The whale sold their entire ETH holdings for $15.71 million earlier today, locking in a profit of $2.75 million. The investor initially purchased the 10,000 ETH for $12.95 million at an average price of $1,295 in two transactions on October 4 and November 14, 2022. Despite continuing to hold when ETH touched $4,000, with a $27.6 million profit, the whale seems to have finally given up at lesser gains. Now, with World Liberty Financial offloading its holdings, investors are carefully waiting on the edge, which could trigger a major retail dump. What Happens to ETH Price Next? So far in 2025, Ethereum bears had the upper hand, breaking under every support level, and giving bulls several nightmares. Prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez has identified $1,200 as a potential support level for Ethereum (ETH) amidst its ongoing market downturn. Martinez’s analysis suggests that the $1,200 price point could act as a key area for ETH to regain stability while avoiding any further decline. Source: Ali Martinez Another analyst venturefounder believes Ethereum (ETH) is either at its cycle bottom or approaching it rapidly. The analyst speculates that ETH could reach its lowest point by the end of April.

Still trading at just $0.025 during its Phase 4, the token is drawing serious attention not just because of price speculation — but because of what the project is building underneath. The real question many are now asking is: Is there still time to get in before the next leg up? According to experts tracking the presale, the window is closing. Previous phases sold out faster than expected, and Phase 4 is already gaining momentum. Once this stage concludes, the price will rise to $0.03, and with the token’s launch price set at $0.06, even conservative estimates suggest early participants will see more than 2x returns before listing. But analysts are projecting much more — with some models pointing to a future value of $0.75 or even higher, which would represent a full 2,900% increase from the current entry point. So, what’s justifying this forecast? At its foundation, Mutuum Finance is more than just another DeFi protocol. It’s a decentralized system that enables both lending and borrowing of digital assets through smart contracts — all without the need for centralized control. Users deposit tokens to earn interest, while borrowers access capital by locking collateral. The platform supports both pooled lending and peer-to-peer agreements, offering flexibility that most protocols in the space lack. Mutuum’s dual-model design is also a key part of its appeal. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model allows users to deposit assets into shared liquidity pools. These pools are then accessed by borrowers who meet collateral requirements. Interest rates in this model aren’t fixed — they shift in real time based on how much of the pool is being used. When borrowing demand is high, returns for depositors increase, creating a balanced, incentive-driven system. At the same time, Mutuum also supports Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending, where users can set up custom loan agreements directly with one another. This model provides more flexibility and is especially useful for assets that don’t always fit into a pooled structure, such as meme tokens like PEPE or DOGE. It gives users more control over terms and risk, while expanding the protocol’s reach beyond traditional assets. This balance between stability and customization has brought in a wide range of early backers, including notable Ethereum holders, who are increasingly looking for opportunities that allow them to maintain exposure to ETH while putting their assets to work. Mutuum offers just that — a way to earn yield or borrow against holdings without selling off long-term positions. Beyond lending, the protocol is developing an overcollateralized stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. Minted from excess collateral within the system, it provides additional utility while remaining fully decentralized and transparent. Interest paid on stablecoin loans goes directly into the platform treasury — helping grow reserves while supporting the value of the native token. What’s especially driving investor interest now is the buy-and-distribute mechanism baked into Mutuum’s revenue model. As the protocol generates fees, a portion is used to buy MUTM on the open market. These purchased tokens are then distributed to mtToken stakers, creating regular buy pressure and aligning rewards with platform growth. This loop helps stabilize price while rewarding users who contribute to liquidity. All of this is coming together just as the presale nears its later stages. With over $6.3 million already raised and more than 8,000 holders participating, interest is growing — but supply is limited. The current phase, priced at $0.025, offers one of the final opportunities to secure MUTM before the next increase to $0.03. Once the token lists and exchange activity picks up, the market will ultimately decide the price — and based on what’s already in place, many expect that move to come fast. So, is it too late to get in? Not yet — but the clock is ticking. As Phase 4 continues and the token edges closer to its next price jump, early buyers still have a narrow window to enter before launch buzz and broader exposure take hold. With real utility, solid infrastructure, and clear investor demand, MUTM has positioned itself as more than a presale token — it’s shaping up to be one of the strongest contenders in DeFi this year.

The rejection at EMA 20 and 50 (~$1.91–$2.03) confirms strong resistance zones. The lower bound of the channel rests near $1.66, which held during the latest sell-off. Bear Flag Breakdown (April 6–7) After sideways consolidation above $2.03, XRP formed a bear flag before sharply breaking down. The target of this flag was nearly met at $1.66, showing precise technical behavior. Double Bottom Attempt / W Pattern (Lower Timeframes) On the 1H and 15m charts, XRP shows a potential W-reversal forming at $1.66–$1.70, which may confirm on a bullish breakout above $1.80–$1.85. Multi-Timeframe Analysis 4-Hour Chart Price is below both EMA 20 & 50, confirming ongoing bearish dominance. Bollinger Bands are wide, price hugging the lower band, suggesting oversold conditions. MACD: Histogram shows decreasing negative momentum, hinting at potential momentum shift. 1-Hour Chart Short-term divergence forming on MACD — lower lows in price vs. higher lows on MACD. If XRP breaks above $1.78–$1.80 on volume, a short-term rally may trigger. 15-Minute Chart XRP building a rounded bottom, testing resistance at $1.75–$1.78. A confirmed breakout here would validate the W-pattern and initiate a bullish leg. Key Support and Resistance Levels Major Support Zones $1.66 – Local double bottom and historical demand zone. $1.60 – Final support before freefall toward $1.40. Major Resistance Zones $1.80–$1.85 – Minor resistance; breakout zone. $1.91 (EMA 20) – Mid-level resistance from Bollinger mid-band. $2.03 (EMA 50 / Broken Support) – Major resistance for trend reversal confirmation. $2.18 – Previous Bollinger Band top; strong sell wall. EMA Structure EMA 20 (approx. $1.91) and EMA 50 (approx. $2.03) are both sloping downward, confirming medium-term downtrend. A break and close above $2.03 on the 4H would begin shifting momentum toward bullish territory.

Speaking at the European Parliament on Tuesday , ESMA executive director Natasha Cazenave highlighted crypto’s potential implications on financial stability. Her warning comes at a time when the markets are witnessing mayhem, following Trump’s tariffs impact. “EU financial markets are, as we speak, under severe strain coming from the broader political and geopolitical developments,” said Cazenave. Cazenave welcomed the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation ( MiCA ), which went into full implementation in December 2024. “It is an important milestone in addressing crypto-assets risks in the EU and we are committed to its successful implementation,” she said. ESMA “Renews” Crypto Warning The fresh warning from the securities regulator arrives a few months after it called for the delisting of stablecoins that were non-compliant with MiCA rules. Further, Bitcoin’s surge in total market value, reaching a record level of $100,000 earlier, has revived concerns about its risks to investors and the financial system. “These developments prompted us to renew our warning to investors in December 2024, to caution them against the crypto hype,” the ESMA executive noted. “We also made it clear that, despite MiCA, there will be no such thing as a safe crypto-asset.” Additionally, the deteriorating macro-economic conditions, shifting investors’ sentiments and the largest-ever crypto hack at Bybit this year, have seen “sudden and extreme fluctuations” in crypto prices. Over 95% of EU Banks Do Not Engage in Crypto Activities “Since 20225, we have been actively monitoring potential risks crypto assets could represent to financial stability,” Cazenave added. The ESMA noted that though risks to financial stability stemming from crypto-assets are increasing, they are “not significant yet”. Cryptos contribute only 1% to total global financial assets and have limited integration with traditional finance. Besides, more than 95% of banks in the EU do not engage in crypto-related activities, the agency added. “Crypto-assets markets are still comparatively small. However, in the current market environment, turmoil even in small markets can originate or catalyse broader stability issues in our financial system.” Cazenave stressed that ESMA should take a “forward-looking approach” and continued close monitoring as crypto markets are evolving rapidly.

Meanwhile, institutional interest in Bitcoin continues to grow, with major financial players preparing to embrace crypto. At Paris Blockchain Week, experts pointed out recent regulatory progress and predicted a surge in traditional finance adoption. Supporting this trend, Cboe announced a new Bitcoin futures product. Bitcoin Gains Momentum as Yuan Falls Tensions between the United States and China escalated once again after President Donald Trump imposed a 104% tariff on Chinese imports. In response to this, Beijing allowed the yuan to weaken significantly against the US dollar, reaching its lowest point since 2023. This move is seen as a strategic counter to rising trade pressures,and it is fueling speculation that China is preparing to devalue its currency even more. This could have far-reaching consequences for global markets and digital assets like Bitcoin. Dollar-to-Yuan exchange rate (Source: Bloomberg ) Analysts believe that expectations for yuan devaluation are rising rapidly. Ju Wang of BNP Paribas stated that the pressure on the Chinese currency is unlikely to ease anytime soon. The weakening yuan also reignited conversations about capital flight from China, with investors potentially moving their wealth into hard assets like Bitcoin. Arthur Hayes, the founder of BitMEX, suggested that such a capital shift is likely, which was a view shared by Bybit CEO Ben Zhou . He believes Bitcoin stands to benefit from Beijing’s currency strategy. Bybit has stepped up as a key platform for Chinese crypto investors. The exchange recently confirmed that users in mainland China can access its services without a VPN, although trading in yuan is still prohibited. Still, its growing accessibility and popularity, particularly among derivatives traders, positions it well to absorb an influx of capital seeking refuge from traditional markets. As the trade war deepens, volatility in currency markets is becoming the new norm. Brent Donnelly , president of Spectra FX Solutions, recently talked about the potential for extreme fluctuations in foreign exchange markets as a result of geopolitical uncertainty. Meanwhile, the US dollar itself showed considerable weakness since Trump’s return to office, with the DXY Dollar Index plunging from nearly 110 to below 103. Julien Bittel from Global Macro Investor said that the drop between late February and early March was one of the biggest declines in a decade. Given Bitcoin’s historical inverse relationship with the US dollar, a continued decline in the greenback could provide more momentum for the current bull market. With both the yuan and dollar under pressure, Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a safe haven for capital navigating the chaos of global macroeconomic shifts. Big Banks Ready to Embrace Bitcoin Despite the turbulence caused by US trade tariffs and the broader market meltdown, industry leaders at major crypto firms are still very optimistic about institutional Bitcoin adoption in 2025. At Paris Blockchain Week on April 8, Messari CEO Eric Turner and Sygnum Bank co-founder Thomas Eichenberger shared a bullish outlook on how traditional finance will increasingly embrace Bitcoin and crypto services later this year. Turner pointed out that while the second quarter of 2025 might stay a bit subdued, he anticipates major developments in the latter half of the year. He pointed to a broader wave of regulatory acceptance, not only in the United States but globally, as a major driver of this shift. With key advancements in market structure and stablecoin regulation gaining traction, Turner is confident that the crypto space is on the brink of a major transition toward institutional legitimacy and integration. Rather than focusing only on the pro-crypto narrative surrounding President Donald Trump, Turner said that the collective stance of regulatory bodies like the SEC is what truly matters. He argued that the convergence of supportive policies across various government agencies is really laying the groundwork for sustainable growth in the crypto market. Paris Blockchain Week Eichenberger fully agreed with this, and stated that international banks with a presence in the US are closely monitoring the regulatory landscape and are preparing to roll out crypto services. These banks, he said, have long had strategic plans for offering services like crypto custody and spot trading but were previously hesitant because of fears of regulatory pushback. Now, with a more transparent and favorable regulatory environment emerging, Eichenberger believes that banks no longer have any reason to hesitate. He expects that many global financial institutions will act on their plans and begin launching crypto services in earnest throughout 2025. Cboe Unveils New Bitcoin Futures Product Turner and Eichenberger’s predictions might not be so far fetched, as the Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) recently unveiled plans to launch a new Bitcoin futures derivative product later this month. According to an April 7 announcement , the exchange plans to introduce FTSE Bitcoin Index futures on April 28, pending regulatory approval. Part of Cboe’s April 7 announcement The futures will be based on the VanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF (XBTF) and will be cash-settled, representing one-tenth of the value of the FTSE Bitcoin Index. Contracts will settle on the last business day of each month. Crypto futures trading is a type of trading where you agree to buy or sell a cryptocurrency, like Bitcoin, at a set price on a future date. Instead of owning the actual crypto, you're speculating on its price going up or down. This is the first product developed through Cboe’s collaboration with FTSE Russell, the index division of the London Stock Exchange Group. It is expected to complement the exchange’s existing suite of Bitcoin derivatives, including the recently launched Bitcoin US ETF Index Options (CBTX) and MBTX. Cboe’s global head of derivatives, Catherine Clay, pointed out that there is a growing market demand for flexible, capital-efficient exposure to crypto. She also believes that the launch comes at a pivotal time for the industry. Cboe is a longstanding institution in financial markets, and played a foundational role in Bitcoin’s integration into traditional finance, dating back to its first Bitcoin futures launch in December of 2017. The exchange also took recent steps to modernize its approach by including a February announcement to implement weekday 24-hour trading to align even more with the crypto market's nonstop activity. While Bitcoin ETFs gained a lot of traction, futures are still a significant part of the ecosystem. In March, open interest in Bitcoin futures took a major hit, with $10 billion wiped out because of excessive leverage. Despite this volatility, innovation in the futures market continues to grow. Coinbase announcement regarding 24/7 trading (Source: Coinbase ) Coinbase, for instance, revealed plans to offer round-the-clock trading of Bitcoin and Ethereum futures to US customers. Additionally, Singapore Exchange (SGX) is preparing to roll out Bitcoin perpetual futures in the latter half of 2025.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-09 05:43:11

Ether (ETH) dived 10%, leading losses among major tokens, with xrp (XRP), dogecoin (DOGE), BNB Chain’s BNB, Solana’s SOL and Cardano’s ADA down more than 5%. Overall market capitalization decreased 6%, extending a 7-day slide to nearly 15%. Smaller tokens showed even deeper losses, with trendy upstart Berachain’s BERA down 20% and memecoins bonk (BONK), pepe (PEPE) and floki (FLOKI) down more than 9%. Traders’ retreat from crypto majors continued, reversing all gains from Tuesday’s relief rally as Trump pushes forward efforts to drastically reorder global trade. Tariffs on any Chinese goods were hiked to 104%, along with import taxes on over 60 trading partners. U.S. treasuries extended their selloff, with 30-year yields soaring more than 20 basis points to 4.98%. That’s a U-turn from the usual safe haven status that bond investors enjoy and a deeply worrying sign for traders. Some market watchers speculated the sell-off may have been caused by a forced liquidation of a large player. ""Since Friday's close to now the 30-year yield is up 56 bps, in three trading days,"" Jim Bianco, the well-followed founder of Bianco Research, said in an X post. ""The last time this yield rose this much in 3 days (close to close) was January 7, 1982, when the yield was 14%."" ""This kind of historic move is caused by a forced liquidation, not human managers make decisions about the outlook for rates at midnight ET,"" he added. Rising yields mean bond prices are falling and increase the cost of borrowing for the U.S. government, which could exacerbate the federal deficit, already strained by heavy debt levels. Investors worry that a prolonged trade war could weaken global trade, disrupt supply chains, and slow U.S. economic growth. This could further pressure U.S equity markets and bitcoin, which tends to mirror the ebbs and flows of U.S. markets. The current selloff suggests the market is pricing in inflation now, but prolonged uncertainty could flip this dynamic. Bears take charge Meanwhile, some traders are eyeing a bitcoin drop to as low as $70,000 in the near term amid the tariff escalations, a move that could further pressure crypto majors. “For investors, the short-term outlook calls for caution, while a further drop to $70,000–$75,000 for Bitcoin is possible if trade tensions escalate, yet this dip presents a buying opportunity for the long haul,” Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “Dollar-cost averaging into Bitcoin is a prudent move now, with an eye on altcoins like Solana for higher-risk upside later.” Lee remained upbeat for recovery to peak prices if the situation lightens in the coming months. “If macro conditions stabilize or pro-crypto policies emerge, we could see Bitcoin hit $95,000–$100,000 by late 2025, lifting the market cap past $3 trillion again. While tariff pressures and a risk-off sentiment have hit altcoins hard, Bitcoin’s resilience and rising dominance near 60% suggest the ecosystem’s fundamentals remain solid, supported by institutional adoption and long-term tailwinds like the halving cycle,” he added.",Markets|Bitcoin|tariff|Ether,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-09 05:46:23

This was the first time that the institutional interest in the token received massive support from the bulls. Since then, the company has been constantly acquiring Bitcoin, which has now reached over 500,000. With this, MicroStrategy has become one of the giant whales, and its position could have a significant impact on the BTC price rally. The last time MicroStrategy acquired 22,048 Bitcoin was at an average price of $86,969 and it holds over 528,000 BTC. The company had acquired BTC when the price was close to $100K, and now that the price has dropped below $80,000, Micheal Saylor has not yet released any new data on acquisition. Moreover, he has not even stated that the company has not sold any BTC during the sell-off as he did before. This raises significant concerns about the upcoming price action and questions regarding why Microstrategy is not purchasing more Bitcoin. Why This Should be a Matter of Concern Micheal Saylor, the former CEO of MicroStrategy, keeps on buying Bitcoin no matter what the price is. It worked perfectly fine in the times when the markets were booming, but now, when the liquidity is tightening again and volatility is rising, more acquisitions may turn the system fragile. After Trump’s Liberation Day, the markets collapsed, and the BTC price plunged hard below $74,500. With the imposition of additional tariffs on China, the trade war has again begun as the BTC price rose above $80,000 but has dropped again to close to $75,000. If the price drops close to Saylor’s average price of around $67,000, he may need to add collateral or liquidate. The recent MicroStrategy’s official filings to the SEC disclose the possibility of liquidating BTC if the price drops below the collateral thresholds. Will This Drag the Bitcoin (BTC) Price Lower? The Federal Reserve held an emergency meeting regarding the interest rates but has released no public statement. Trump wants a 2% rate cut, but that’s not happening before the next scheduled FOMC meeting in May. Due to this, the uncertainty over the global markets as well as the crypto markets may persist, which could negatively impact the BTC price rally. The BTC price continues to trade within a descending parallel channel and dropped below the average bands and the crucial support at $76,763. While the technicals flashed mixed signals, the chart patterns suggest the bullish strength is fading slowly. This hints towards the possibility of entering the support zone between $73,971 and $72,590 in the coming days. If the price fails to trigger a rebound and a sustained upswing, a plunge below $70,000 could be imminent.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-09 05:47:45

While the broader crypto market is also bleeding , the catalyst for this correction appears to be rooted in geopolitics and mounting fears of a recession. BREAKING: Bitcoin falls below $75,000 as crypto markets erase -$500 billion since the April 2nd high. pic.twitter.com/uFBKUms881 — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) April 9, 2025 The back-and-forth tariff war is heating China dumped $50B in U.S. treasuries, and now the U.S. is hitting back with a 104% tariff on Chinese goods, starting in just hours. Until clear progress is made or retail traders start shorting or selling off heavily, extreme volatility is expected across all markets. Trump’s Tariff War Sends Shockwaves Across Risk Assets The immediate trigger came from Donald Trump’s aggressive 104% tariff on Chinese goods, which went into effect recently. This move has rattled global investors and sparked a broader risk-off sentiment. Equities, bonds, and cryptocurrencies are all reacting to the rising trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies. Bitcoin, known for its sensitivity to macroeconomic instability, faced strong selling pressure. Institutional activity confirmed this as BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) offloaded 3,296 BTC in a single day—marking its third-largest outflow since inception. Altogether, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs saw net outflows of $326 million on the day, adding to the downward momentum. Market Trapped in a False Rally Bitcoin briefly rallied to $80,400 in what seemed like a relief bounce. However, that rally quickly faded, and prices slipped back into a downward spiral, forming a classic bull trap. Over $390 million in crypto liquidations followed, according to Coinglass , as traders were caught on the wrong side of the move. Altcoins saw a short-lived bounce, with ETH climbing 2.04% to $1,567, while SOL and XRP jumped nearly 5%. Dogecoin led the hourly surge with a 5.5% spike, and even BNB edged up 1.49%. However, the overall crypto market cap still dropped 4.27% in the past 24 hours, suggesting this rally was driven more by speculation than real improvement, likely fueled by false crypto news . Analysts See This as a Global Threat Economists now warn that the current situation bears similarities to late 2018, when the Fed was forced to shift course due to a weakening economy. Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, said that the Fed is “on the clock,” pointing out that the current combination of falling equities and rising bond yields is a troubling sign. Peter Schiff echoed this concern, stating that if Trump’s goal was to crash the market to lower interest rates, it’s now backfiring, with long-term Treasury yields climbing to new highs. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Price May be at Risk as Institutions Halt BTC Acquisitions—Should You be Worried? , How Low BTC to Go?

The whale initially bought a total of 10,000 Ether ( ETH ) across two transactions in October and November 2022 for $13 million at the time for an average price of $1,295 per token, blockchain analytics service Lookonchain said in an April 8 X post. “He didn’t sell when Ether broke through $4,000. But today, he exited with a $2.75 million profit. The profit at the peak was $27.6 million,” Lookonchain said. Source: Lookonchain The whale sold when Ether was around $1,578, according to Lookonchain. Within the period that the whale wallet was holding its stack, Ether hit a high of $4,015 on Dec. 9, CoinGecko data shows . Ether is sitting at around $1,426, down 24% over the last seven days amid a broader market sell-off sparked by the Trump administration’s sweeping global tariffs. ETH hit its all-time high of $4,878 on Nov. 10, 2021, about a year before the whale’s first purchase. Trump’s World Liberty Financial sells part of ETH stash In a separate April 9 post to X, Lookonchain said the Donald Trump-backed crypto project, World Liberty Financial (WLF), might have also sold some of its Ether stash at a loss. “A wallet possibly linked to World Liberty sold 5,471 ETH ($8.01M) at $1,465,” Lookonchain wrote. Source: Lookonchain Before the supposed sale, Lookonchain said World Liberty Financial had a stash of 67,498 Ether, which it bought at an average price of $3,259.

Trump’s reciprocal tariffs came into effect today, including a cumulative 104% levy on Chinese imports. Traders were also disappointed by the lack of concrete developments in trade negotiations, even though President Trump spoke with various leaders from major trading partners. According to the Asian Development Outlook, developing Asian economies are projected to see a gradual deceleration in GDP growth, from 5.0% in 2024 to 4.9% in 2025 (the slowest since 2022) and further to 4.7% in 2026. Meanwhile, investors are awaiting the release of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s March policy meeting minutes, due later in the day, to gauge policymakers' rate cut pain point. Japan ( NKY:IND ) fell 4.19% toward 31,800 while the broader Topix Index tumbled 2.9% to 2,362 on Wednesday, giving back gains from the previous session. The Japanese yen appreciated past 146 per dollar on Wednesday, rising for the second straight session. Japan also faces a 24% tariff on its goods and a 25% levy on car shipments to the US. Meanwhile, Trump said that Japan is sending a team to negotiate on trade with the US, while Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba revealed that he told Trump in a phone call to rethink his tariff policies. On the domestic front, Japan’s current account surplus surged to a record high in February, driven by strong export growth and a decline in imports, adding further support to the yen. The consumer confidence index in Japan dropped to 34.1 in March 2025 from a downwardly revised 34.8 in the previous month, declining for the fourth straight month and reaching its lowest level since March 2023. China ( SHCOMP ) rose 0.21% to below 3,100 while the Shenzhen Component lost 0.9% to 9,340 on Wednesday, reversing gains from the previous session as US President Donald Trump is set to impose a hefty 104% tariff on China in what appears to be an all-out trade war, and the offshore yuan climbed toward 7.38 per dollar on Wednesday, rebounding from three consecutive sessions of losses, supported by a depreciating US dollar. In the meantime, Beijing on Tuesday vowed to “fight to the end” to protect its interests, accusing the U.S. of engaging in economic blackmail, contrasts with the White House's claim that Trump won't back down on tariffs, and that China wants a deal, but doesn't know how to make one. Meanwhile, during a call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Tuesday, Premier Li Qiang emphasized that China’s macroeconomic policies are designed to address uncertainties and expressed confidence in sustained growth this year. Both China and Europe are preparing for significant impacts from new U.S. tariffs, with China facing a 104% surtax and Europe a 20% levy. Caution also grew ahead of China’s March CPI and PPI data due later this week, with deflation risks still looming. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell 1.78% to 19,662 in early trade on Wednesday, reversing strong gains from the previous session. India ( SENSEX ) fell 0.53% to 73,865 in early deals on Wednesday, erasing gains from the previous session. However, the RBI's decision to cut interest rates by 25 bps to 6% capped the fall, despite the central bank revising its GDP forecast downward to 6.5% from 6.7% for FY2025-26, while inflation was revised to 4% from 4.2%. Australia ( AS51 ) fell 1.91% to around 7,360 on Wednesday, reversing gains from the previous session. The Australian dollar appreciated toward $0.60 on Wednesday, rebounding slightly from five-year lows. Australia will face the minimum 10% levy, with Trump taking a particular interest in blocking Australian beef amid long-standing restrictions on US beef exports to the country. In the U.S., on Tuesday, all three major indexes ended in red as optimism over global tariff negotiations soured after President Trump confirmed the imposition of a 104% tariff on China, effective tomorrow. Meanwhile, the Treasury Department auctioned $58 billion in 3-year notes on Tuesday, marking the first coupon supply since the tariff announcement. U.S. stock futures declined Wednesday as President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs came into effect today, including a 104% levy on Chinese imports: Dow -1.88% ; S&P 500 -2.04% ; Nasdaq -2.08% .

On Sunday, CoinDesk discussed the possibility of pronounced downside volatility in risk assets due to a potential unwinding of the Treasury market arbitrage bets, a dynamic that catalyzed the 2020 crash. Per observers, the unwinding of the so-called carry trades, involving hedge funds exploiting minor price discrepancies between Treasury futures and securities, has begun. That's evident from the nearly 70 basis points rise in the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield to 4.5%. The 30-year yield has seen a similar rise. Note that yields move in the opposite direction of prices and typically drop during risk aversion as investors seek refuge in government bonds. ""It's all running vertical now with 30-year Treasury yields on the cusp of hitting the 5% mark. For some context, 10-year yields in the US were at a low of 3.88% on Monday. This points to further liquidation in Treasuries and that's a sign that we are seeing distress in the parts of the market that we should not normally talk about i.e. funding, credit, repo,"" ForexLive's analyst Justin Low said in a market update discussing the implosion of the basis trade. Low added that it's ""all going sideways at the moment"" as a sharp rise in yields itself can have a far-reaching impact on markets, housing and the economy. Stocks drop, BTC under pressure Futures tied to the S&P 500, Wall Street's benchmark equity index, fell 2% amid increased volatility in the Treasury market. Bitcoin fell briefly below $75,000 early today and has since recovered to trade near $76,000, CoinDesk data showed. The MOVE index, which represents the options-implied 30-day price turbulence in the Treasury market, jumped to 140, the highest since October 2023, according to data source TradingView. The worsening of the risk sentiment has raised the risk of BTC falling to the $73.8K-$74.4K range, where holders of bullish long positions in the perpetual futures listed on major exchanges face liquidation risks, according to data tracked by analytics firm Hyblock Capital. Liquidation represents the forced closure of positions by exchanges due to margin shortages. Large long liquidations often add to downside price volatility. ""We see long liquidation clusters (where we estimate liquidations to get triggered) at 73800-74400, 69800-70000, 66100-67700. In particular, if we hit 70k, we likely go down at least $200 more, taking the retail stop losses right below 70k and the liquidation levels liquidity,"" Hyblock told CoinDesk. On the higher side, Hyblock identified $80,900-$81,000, $85,500-$86,700, and $89,500-$92,600 as prominent zones for potential short liquidations.",Markets|Bitcoin|Liquidations,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-09 05:56:41

Stablecoin protocol M^0 is expanding to Solana , allowing developers to create digital dollars that are tailored to their needs and easily interchangeable with high liquidity, the firm said in a press release shared with crypto.news. KAST, a neobank built on stablecoins, will be the first to use M^0’s platform on Solana. According to the press release, the company plans to create two digital dollars to tokenize deposits and later expand into payments and savings. “By issuing our own stablecoin, we ensure full transparency, with all customer deposits represented on-chain. Solana was the clear choice for deployment, given our strong existing partnership and its advantages in speed and low fees.” Raagulan Pathy, co-founder & CEO of KAST You might also like: Tether in US regulatory talks over stablecoin as possible ‘settlement currency’ Joao Reginatto, Chief Strategy Officer at M^0, explains that the company’s decision to bring M^0 to Solana is driven by its goal to empower builders to “create stablecoins that are not only interoperable, liquid, and tailored to their use cases, but that can also perform at any scale.” The latest expansion follows just a few months after M^0 teamed up with the Cosmos-based Noble blockchain to shake up the stablecoin market, which is mainly controlled by Tether ( USDT ) and Circle ( USDC ). Earlier in December 2024, Noble launched its new dollar-backed token, USDN, powered by M^0’s decentralized stablecoin infrastructure.

AMP price analysis is bullish. AMP/USD price jumped to $0.00323 in the last 24 hours. Overall, the cryptocurrency gained 3.19% through the day. Technical indicators give a relatively bearish verdict for the market conditions. However, the price charts present a bullish scenario for the day. Is AMP a good investment? AMP has been struggling with a bearish trend for the past few months. Despite this, its strong fundamentals suggest it could be a solid long-term investment. Crypto analysts suggest that the coming weeks will steadily increase the cryptocurrency’s value. A bullish rally may be expected in the latter part of 2025, potentially pushing AMP above $0.00694. However, conducting your research and seeking professional financial advice is recommended. Why is AMP up? AMP’s price has increased today. Additionally, the coin has experienced a considerable gain of 3.19% over the last 24 hours. The price is trading at $0.00323, which is just below the average range as the bears remained in the lead during the week. Will AMP reach $0.010? AMP’s resistance level is at $0.005, yet a break above this level is possible if sufficient buying momentum builds. A break near or above $0.010 will require a more robust push but isn’t impossible, as the coin achieved this level on December 3, 2024. What will AMP price target be in 2025? The highest price target for AMP in 2025 is $0.00694. Will AMP ever reach $1? Amp has never spiked above the $0.12 level. Even this price mark was observed only once at the start of the token’s launch, and AMP has never seen this level again. It seems highly unlikely for AMP to achieve $1 soon. Will AMP reach $10? According to the price prediction, AMP will not achieve this level in the next 10 years until something unusual happens. Considering AMP’s current market cap of only $423.6 million, the scenario seems almost impossible. What will AMP be worth in 2030? The highest price of AMP in 2030 is expected to be around $0.02622. Does AMP have a good long-term Future? Amp is trading near its average price level if observed over the longest price period levels. It can be a good long-term investment, as its price is expected to double in 2026 and reach $0.03008 by 2031.

AMP historic price sentiment The AMP token was officially launched on September 11, 2020, with an initial price of $0.009. In its early months, AMP experienced a downward trend, hitting an all-time low of roughly $0.0007 on November 17 of the same year. AMP price history However, the token reversed its fortunes entering 2021. It surpassed its launch price, reaching a notable high of about $0.046 on February 14, 2021. The momentum continued, and by April 18, AMP’s price peaked at $0.064. AMP set new records, reaching a high of $0.077 on May 7, 2021, and then $0.12 on June 16, following its listing on the prominent cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase. Despite these spikes, the overall trend for the rest of the year was bearish. By September 2021, AMP had fallen below the $0.05 mark as per crypto market data. In January 2022, AMP declined further to $0.02. The bear market proved challenging, and by June of that year, AMP’s price had fallen below its initial launch price. On September 7, it hit a 52-week low of $0.0054. In 2023, AMP attained a maximum price of $0.00642 and a minimum price of about $0.00146. Near the end of the year, AMP was trading at $0.0035. At the start of 2024, AMP gradually started its bullish cycle and reached $0.0056. On March 13, it peaked at $0.0129 before reversing. For May, June, and July, the AMP token continued its slow descent from the $0.0081 level to reach $0.0040, almost losing 40% of its value in three months. At the start of August 2024, AMP continued following the downtrend, reaching $0.0031, but made high spikes, leveling back to $0.00342 on August 25.

In March, AMP came further down to the $0.0051 level, and at the start of April, it is trading near $0.0038.",Crypto Price Predictions|AMP,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|ICO|MARKET|TRADING|OTHER|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-04-09 06:00:00

The Department of Justice has officially shut down its National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET), a unit previously tasked with targeting crypto-related crime. At the same time, the administration has introduced new import tariffs, including a 34% levy on Chinese goods, signaling a return to aggressive trade posturing. While critics warn of rising tensions and regulatory gaps, some analysts believe these measures are part of a broader strategy to reshape US positioning in both digital finance and global commerce. DOJ Disbands National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team Amid Trump-Driven Policy Shift The Department of Justice (DOJ) is reportedly disbanding its National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET), according to a leaked internal memo seen by Fortune and cited in a report released April 8. The four-page document, authored by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, asserts that the Justice Department is “not a digital assets regulator,” criticizing the previous administration’s approach to crypto -related enforcement. The memo pointedly accuses the Biden administration of engaging in “regulation by prosecution,” a strategy Blanche described as reckless. The NCET, launched in October 2021 under President Joe Biden, was tasked with investigating and prosecuting crimes involving cryptocurrency platforms and digital asset service providers. At the time, then-Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco framed the unit as a necessary step to “dismantle the financial ecosystem” supporting digital asset–related crime. Since becoming operational in February 2022, the NCET played a significant role in targeting crypto-related fraud, sanctions evasion, ransomware payments, and money laundering schemes. The timing of the disbandment is no coincidence. The move comes just months after President Donald Trump signed an executive order in January reshaping US crypto policy, part of a broader effort to position the United States as a global leader in digital asset innovation. The dismantling of NCET is reportedly effective immediately. Trump’s Crypto Policy: From the Campaign Trail to the White House Trump’s pro-crypto stance has been a defining aspect of his return to the presidency. Throughout his 2024 campaign and beyond, he emphasized a future in which the US would embrace blockchain innovation rather than stifle it. His proposals have included creating a US strategic Bitcoin reserve, supporting the use of decentralized finance (DeFi), and establishing the country as a global hub for digital assets. Moreover, Trump appointed a pro-crypto chairman to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), signaling a fundamental shift in how regulatory agencies are expected to approach the sector. The SEC under the new leadership has already begun reviewing several crypto-related ETF applications more favorably and is working on streamlining compliance for digital asset firms. However, this new direction has not come without controversy. Despite—or perhaps because of—Trump’s apparent support for the industry, critics have raised red flags about potential conflicts of interest. Trump and members of his inner circle have deep personal and financial ties to several high-profile crypto ventures. These include the World Liberty Financial (WLFI) DeFi platform, the Official Trump (TRUMP) meme coin, and a series of crypto-related ETFs being launched by Trump Media in partnership with Crypto.com. The WLFI platform recently made headlines due to its USD1 stablecoin, which some lawmakers fear could undermine bipartisan efforts in Congress to establish clear, centralized regulations for stablecoins. In late March, five Senate Democrats issued a letter urging top regulators to assess the ramifications of a politically-affiliated stablecoin. That concern was echoed earlier this month when Representative Maxine Waters suggested that Trump’s ultimate goal might be to challenge or even replace the US dollar with USD1. In parallel, the TRUMP meme coin became embroiled in allegations of insider trading—accusations that were later dismissed by some blockchain analysts as the result of MEV (maximal extractable value) bot activity rather than direct manipulation. Nevertheless, the incident added fuel to the fire of concern about the entanglement between federal policymaking and personal digital asset investments. What’s Next for Crypto Enforcement in the US? With the NCET dissolved, questions remain over how the federal government will handle criminal cases involving cryptocurrency. While the DOJ is stepping back from centralized enforcement, it’s unclear whether its individual field offices will continue pursuing crypto-related crimes through traditional financial crime units, or whether a new structure will emerge under Trump’s revamped digital asset policy framework. Legal experts have expressed concern that disbanding the NCET without a clear replacement could create a gap in enforcement and oversight—potentially emboldening malicious actors during a time of rapid digital asset adoption. Global Trade Tensions Could Ease as Trump Eyes Deal With China Amid Tariff Fallout In related news, global markets are on edge following US President Trump’s announcement of sweeping new import tariffs earlier this month, raising fears of a renewed trade war between the world’s two largest economies. However, insiders and analysts suggest the aggressive moves may ultimately be a strategic gambit aimed at securing a landmark trade agreement with China. On April 2, Trump shocked global markets by announcing a 10% baseline tariff on all imported goods starting April 5. Most notably, Chinese imports face a steep 34% levy beginning April 9, reigniting concerns over economic decoupling and retaliatory escalation. Equity markets faltered following the news, while crypto markets—often considered risk-sensitive—saw increased volatility and uncertainty. Despite the seemingly aggressive stance, Raoul Pal, CEO and founder of Global Macro Investor, believes the Trump administration’s tough rhetoric may be more calculated than confrontational. In an April 8 post on X, Pal suggested the current negotiations are designed to extract a favorable deal from Beijing rather than to wage a prolonged trade war. “In the end, almost all the other tariff negotiations and rhetoric are all about getting China to agree a deal,” Pal wrote. “That is the big prize, and both China and the US understand it and need it.” Pal also emphasized the strategic nature of the US efforts to prevent tariff circumvention, noting that Washington is targeting rerouting tactics via nations like Mexico and Vietnam, which have previously been used as alternative trade channels by Chinese exporters seeking to dodge US levies. China Fires Back With Matching Tariffs In a direct tit-for-tat response, China imposed its own 34% tariff on all American imports, effective April 10, according to a report by state-run media outlet Xinhua. China’s Foreign Ministry characterized the US tariffs as “economic bullying” and issued a stern warning that it would “fight till the end” if necessary. The retaliatory measures from Beijing significantly dim hopes for a short-term resolution. China, which surpassed the United States as the world’s largest trading nation in 2012, is determined to maintain its status and global influence amid rising protectionist threats. The latest moves mark a critical juncture for global trade. While both sides claim to be acting in national interest, observers warn that continued escalation could trigger ripple effects across supply chains, inflation metrics, and global financial markets. The crypto market, already experiencing heightened sensitivity due to macroeconomic uncertainty and shifting Federal Reserve policy, is closely watching the outcome of the US–China trade talks. Analysts suggest a deal—or even the perception of progress—could serve as a powerful bullish signal for digital assets. Nansen analysts estimate that crypto markets now have a 70% chance of bottoming out by June 2025, depending on the resolution of trade tensions and other macroeconomic drivers. Strategic Moves or Political Grandstanding? While Trump’s bold tariff plan has been met with backlash from economists and global leaders alike, some insiders view it as a strategic ploy meant to bolster US leverage. According to Raoul Pal, Trump’s primary aim is to force China into a deal that benefits the US economy and shores up domestic manufacturing—two of the president’s key policy priorities. Still, not everyone is convinced that a resolution is within reach. Skeptics argue that even if the tariff measures are intended as a negotiating tool, the damage to international relations and market confidence may be difficult to reverse. With the April 9 and 10 deadlines for the respective tariff implementations now in place, the world is watching to see whether cooler heads will prevail. The markets, particularly the crypto sector, are likely to remain volatile until a clearer picture of US–China trade policy emerges. Some investors hold out hope that behind closed doors, the two nations are working toward a deal that would not only ease economic pressure but also establish a new baseline for cooperation in a digitally driven global economy. Until then, the crypto community and broader financial markets will continue to navigate a precarious environment shaped by both political maneuvering and economic necessity.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-09 06:00:00

Despite a 4.1% recovery in the past 24 hours bringing it back to $79,825, Bitcoin remains down 26% from its all-time high of over $109,000 recorded in January 2025. Market sentiment remains mixed, as investors weigh on-chain data, short-term volatility, and the broader macroeconomic environment.

Bitcoin Open Interest Reflects Cautious Sentiment Bitcoin’s open interest metric has revealed cautious behavior among leveraged traders. CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn reported a 17.8% drop in Bitcoin open interest over the past week. This decline represents a significant reduction in the number of outstanding derivative contracts and may reflect investor hesitation following recent price volatility. Historically, such sharp declines in open interest have occurred before major market rebounds, as speculative leverage is flushed out of the system. With leverage reset, market participants may begin re-entering positions, especially if prices find a strong support level or if further whale accumulation signals renewed bullish momentum. Bitcoin Open Interest dropped -17.8% 🩸 This is over the last 7 days – shedding billions in leverage. Over the last 2 years, these flush-outs often set the stage for major buy opportunity’s. pic.twitter.com/wXIxSXr7Nz — Maartunn (@JA_Maartun) April 8, 2025 Accumulation Trends Signal Long-Term Confidence Meanwhile, there has been a notable trend in the behavior of long-term holders and whales. According to on-chain data shared by CryptoQuant contributor Onchained, a substantial number of accumulating addresses have continued to buy Bitcoin aggressively even during the asset’s climb to new highs. This cohort’s realized capitalization has surged from around $20 billion in 2023 to $160 billion in 2025, with BTC supply held by these entities increasing from approximately 800,000 to 3 million BTC. This trend suggests that rather than scaling back during price increases, large holders significantly accelerated their buying efforts, indicating a high level of conviction. The analyst wrote: This indicates the average acquisition price per bitcoin for accumulating addresses rose substantially, yet accumulation accelerated rather than slowed. A strong evidence of high-conviction buying regardless of price increases. Onchained also noted a widening gap between retail and whale realized capitalization, pointing to the growing role of high-capital investors in market dynamics. These whale wallets, typically less reactive to short-term market swings, are continuing to remove BTC from circulation, a pattern that may contribute to future supply constraints. Onchained’s analysis further highlights three key implications: a growing supply-side pressure as more BTC enters inactive wallets, strong conviction from holders through all market phases, and the potential for future supply shocks as long-term accumulation continues.

Investors will be left with no other option but Bitcoin, says crypto exec “First time the thought hit me and didn’t feel like theory but an actual truth to grapple with,” Parks added. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley shared a similar view, noting that with trust in the US dollar waning and other foreign currencies seen as “even weaker,” investors are left with fewer choices. He argued that gold, typically seen as a safe harbor amid uncertainty, also has drawbacks around shipping and storage and implied that Bitcoin may be the only option left. “You wind up buying Bitcoin,” Horsley said. Source: Michael Saylor The US Dollar Index — which tracks its strength against a basket of major currencies — is trading at 102.193, down 5.84% since Jan. 1, according to TradingView. However, Wall Street analysts were mistaken in thinking that the tariffs would bolster the US dollar, according to a recent Wall Street Journal report . On April 2, Trump signed an executive order establishing a 10% baseline tariff on all imports from all countries, which took effect on April 5. Harsher reciprocal tariffs on trading partners with which the US has the largest trade deficits then kicked in on April 9. Uncertainty around the tariffs and fears of a broader recession have been major catalysts for a wide traditional and crypto market decline. Bitcoin ( BTC ) is trading at $76,301, down 18.37% since Jan. 1, according to CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin author Saifedean Ammous said in an April 8 X post that America’s issue isn’t with one specific country’s deficit but with aggregate deficits worldwide due to having a “fiat money printer.” Related: Bitcoin weekly RSI hits bull market low as trader sees $70K BTC price bottom “An ever-increasing number of Americans can live off the money printer as long as the rest of the world is using the dollar,” Ammous said. He argued that the real solution is to stop printing “fake money” and move to a hard store of value, naming Bitcoin or gold as examples. “Another way to solve this problem would be for the world to move to a hard money standard and stop using America’s shitcoin, and give Trump the trade surpluses he thinks he wants.” Magazine: Bitcoin heading to $70K soon?

So, how can crypto borrowing be made safer while still maintaining profitability? Enter Symphonim Nexus Alliance (SNA) – a game-changer in the DeFi landscape.

According to the latest data from Yahoo Finance, Nasdaq futures have experienced a significant stock market decline , dropping by 2.44% to $16,823.75 in the last 24 hours. This sharp downturn raises critical questions about the broader market volatility and its potential ripple effects across various asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Is this just a minor dip, or a sign of deeper economic concerns? Let’s delve into what this stock market decline could mean for your investments and the overall financial landscape. Why Are Nasdaq Futures Plummeting? Understanding the Stock Market Decline The 2.44% drop in Nasdaq futures is not just a number; it represents a significant shift in market sentiment. Several factors could be contributing to this stock market decline . These include: Rising Inflation Fears: Persistent inflation continues to be a major concern. Recent economic data might be suggesting that inflation is proving more stubborn than initially anticipated, leading investors to anticipate more aggressive interest rate hikes from central banks. Geopolitical Uncertainty: Global events and geopolitical tensions always add a layer of unpredictability to the markets. Any escalation in these situations can trigger sell-offs as investors seek safer havens. Earnings Season Jitters: As earnings season progresses, investors are closely scrutinizing company reports and forward guidance. Disappointing earnings or cautious outlooks from major tech companies (which heavily influence the Nasdaq) can lead to downward pressure on futures. Profit Taking: After periods of gains, some investors may be taking profits off the table, contributing to the downward momentum. Decoding Market Volatility: What Does a 2.44% Nasdaq Futures Drop Really Mean? A 2.44% drop in Nasdaq futures is undeniably significant. To put it into perspective, consider these points regarding market volatility : Increased Investor Anxiety: Such a sharp decline often reflects heightened anxiety among investors. It suggests a shift from a bullish to a more cautious or even bearish outlook, at least in the short term. Potential for Further Downside: Large drops can sometimes trigger a snowball effect. Fear can lead to more selling, potentially exacerbating the stock market decline . Impact on Crypto: The cryptocurrency market, while often touted as being uncorrelated, has shown increasing correlation with traditional markets, particularly the tech-heavy Nasdaq. A significant drop in Nasdaq futures can often foreshadow similar movements in crypto. Trading Opportunities: For savvy traders, increased market volatility can also present opportunities. However, it’s crucial to approach such periods with caution and robust risk management strategies. Investment Risk Assessment: Navigating the Current Economic Downturn In times of market volatility and potential economic downturn , assessing investment risk becomes paramount. Here’s what investors should consider: Risk Factor Potential Impact Actionable Insight High Inflation Erosion of purchasing power, reduced corporate profits, increased cost of borrowing. Review portfolio for inflation-resistant assets, consider hedging strategies. Interest Rate Hikes Increased borrowing costs, potential slowdown in economic growth, pressure on asset valuations. Assess debt levels, diversify investments, consider fixed-income adjustments. Geopolitical Instability Supply chain disruptions, increased energy prices, market uncertainty. Monitor global events, diversify geographically, maintain a long-term perspective. Earnings Misses Stock price declines, reduced investor confidence, potential sector-specific downturns. Analyze company fundamentals, focus on quality stocks, be prepared for volatility. Is This the Start of an Economic Downturn? What Investors Need to Watch While a single day’s stock market decline doesn’t definitively signal an economic downturn , it’s a crucial signal that demands attention. To gauge whether this is a temporary blip or a more prolonged trend, investors should closely monitor: Economic Indicators: Keep an eye on key economic data releases such as inflation reports, GDP growth, employment figures, and consumer confidence indices. These provide clues about the overall health of the economy. Central Bank Actions: Pay close attention to statements and policy decisions from central banks like the Federal Reserve. Their actions regarding interest rates and monetary policy will significantly influence market direction. Corporate Earnings: Analyze earnings reports and future guidance from major companies across different sectors. Weak earnings and pessimistic outlooks can be leading indicators of a potential economic downturn . Market Sentiment: Track market sentiment through various indicators like the VIX (volatility index) and investor surveys. High volatility and negative sentiment can suggest increased investment risk and potential for further declines. Navigating the Uncertainty: Actionable Insights for Crypto and Traditional Investors In these uncertain times, both crypto and traditional investors need to be proactive and strategic. Here are some actionable insights: Diversify Your Portfolio: Diversification remains a cornerstone of risk management. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Spread your investments across different asset classes to mitigate the impact of market volatility in any single sector. Review Your Risk Tolerance: Market downturns are a good time to reassess your risk tolerance. Are you comfortable with the level of risk in your current portfolio? Adjust your asset allocation accordingly. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news and economic developments. Reliable financial news sources and analysis can help you make informed decisions. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging: For long-term investors, market dips can be opportunities to buy assets at lower prices using a dollar-cost averaging strategy. Don’t Panic Sell: Emotional decisions can be detrimental in investing. Avoid panic selling during downturns. Instead, focus on your long-term investment strategy and make rational, informed choices. Conclusion: Staying Vigilant in the Face of Market Volatility The 2.44% drop in Nasdaq futures serves as a stark reminder of the inherent market volatility and investment risk present in today’s financial landscape. While it’s not necessarily a definitive predictor of a prolonged economic downturn , it’s a significant event that warrants careful observation. For crypto investors, the interconnectedness of markets means these traditional market signals cannot be ignored. Staying informed, understanding the underlying factors driving market movements, and adopting a prudent investment strategy are crucial for navigating these uncertain times and safeguarding your financial future. The key is to remain vigilant, adaptable, and prepared for potential further fluctuations in both traditional and cryptocurrency markets.

The wild world of decentralized finance (DeFi) has just delivered another jolt of drama. News has broken about a significant Ethereum sell-off linked to a project with a rather prominent name attached – World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a DeFi venture reportedly associated with the Trump family. Buckle up as we dive into the details of this developing story and what it could mean for the broader crypto landscape. Sudden Ethereum Sell-off Sparks Market Speculation Just moments ago, blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain, armed with data from Arkham, sent ripples through the crypto community with a tweet heard ’round the digital world. They reported a massive Ethereum sell-off originating from a wallet suspected to be linked to World Liberty Financial (WLFI). The numbers are staggering: 5,471 ETH dumped: In a single swift move, the wallet offloaded a hefty 5,471 Ethereum tokens. $8.01 Million Value: This Ethereum sell-off translated to a cool $8.01 million at the time of the transaction. Fire-Sale Price: The ETH was sold at a rate of $1,465 per token. Timing is Everything: This major dump occurred just an hour before the news broke, suggesting a potentially rapid decision. This Ethereum sell-off immediately raises eyebrows and prompts a crucial question: Why now? Was this a strategic move to cut losses, or is there more to this unfolding saga? WLFI’s DeFi Project: A Deep Dive into the Numbers To truly grasp the magnitude of this crypto market loss and the potential implications for WLFI, let’s rewind and examine their initial investment strategy. According to the same reports, WLFI had previously made a significant bet on Ethereum: Massive ETH Purchase: WLFI reportedly acquired a whopping 67,498 ETH. $210 Million Investment: This accumulation cost them a substantial $210 million. High Entry Point: Their average purchase price per ETH was a hefty $3,259. Now, compare this initial investment with the recent Ethereum sell-off price of $1,465. The stark difference reveals a grim reality for WLFI. The Cold Hard Facts: Calculating the Crypto Market Loss Let’s break down the numbers to fully understand the extent of the crypto market loss faced by WLFI: Metric Value Original ETH Purchase 67,498 ETH Total Investment $210 Million Average Purchase Price $3,259 per ETH ETH Sold Recently 5,471 ETH Selling Price $1,465 per ETH Value of ETH Sold $8.01 Million Potential Total Loss (Unrealized) $125 Million As you can see, based on these figures, WLFI is currently sitting on a staggering potential loss of $125 million on their Ethereum holdings. This significant crypto market loss raises serious questions about the future viability of the DeFi project and the investment strategies employed. Trump Family Crypto Link: What’s the Connection to WLFI? The mention of the “Trump family” in connection with WLFI adds another layer of intrigue to this DeFi project saga. While direct involvement remains to be officially confirmed, the reports citing sources linking the project to the Trump family name are circulating widely. This association, whether direct or indirect, inevitably draws increased scrutiny and media attention to WLFI’s operations, especially in the wake of this substantial Ethereum sell-off and subsequent crypto market loss . The potential connection to such a high-profile family amplifies the stakes. Any missteps or financial difficulties within the DeFi project are likely to be magnified in the public eye, potentially impacting not only WLFI but also perceptions of celebrity-endorsed or associated crypto ventures. Analyzing the DeFi Project’s Future: Challenges and Uncertainties The massive Ethereum sell-off and the reported $125 million paper loss paint a concerning picture for the future of the WLFI DeFi project . Several challenges and uncertainties now loom large: Investor Confidence: Such a significant and public crypto market loss can severely erode investor confidence. Will investors continue to back WLFI, or will this trigger further withdrawals and instability? Project Viability: A $125 million loss is a substantial blow to any project. Does WLFI have sufficient reserves to weather this storm and continue its operations? The long-term viability of the DeFi project is now in question. Regulatory Scrutiny: Given the high-profile association and the scale of the reported losses, WLFI may attract increased regulatory attention. The already complex and evolving regulatory landscape for DeFi could pose further hurdles. Market Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is notoriously volatile. While the Ethereum sell-off might be an attempt to mitigate further losses, it could also be a reaction to broader market trends or internal project issues. Actionable Insights: Lessons from the WLFI Ethereum Sell-off This Ethereum sell-off event, regardless of the specific circumstances surrounding WLFI, offers valuable lessons for anyone involved in or considering entering the crypto and DeFi space: Risk Management is Paramount: The WLFI situation underscores the critical importance of robust risk management strategies in crypto investments. Diversification, stop-loss orders, and thorough due diligence are not just suggestions, they are necessities. Due Diligence Beyond the Hype: Celebrity endorsements or high-profile associations should not be the sole basis for investment decisions. Dig deep into the project’s fundamentals, team, technology, and financial health. Understand Market Volatility: Be prepared for significant price swings and market corrections. The crypto market is inherently volatile, and large losses are a real possibility. Transparency and Accountability: Demand transparency from DeFi projects . Understand how they manage funds, mitigate risks, and ensure accountability. Conclusion: A Stark Reminder of Crypto Market Realities The Ethereum sell-off linked to the WLFI DeFi project serves as a stark reminder of the inherent risks and potential pitfalls within the cryptocurrency market. While DeFi offers exciting opportunities, it also demands caution, thorough research, and a realistic understanding of market dynamics. The reported $125 million paper loss for WLFI is a sobering example of how quickly fortunes can change in the crypto world. As the story continues to unfold, the crypto community will be watching closely to see how WLFI navigates these turbulent waters and what lessons can be learned from this high-profile crypto market loss .

The crypto market is a constantly evolving landscape, and understanding its cyclical nature is key to navigating its thrilling ups and downs. Right now, a crucial indicator is flashing: the Altcoin Season Index . According to CoinMarketCap (CMC), this index has registered a low score of 16 as of April 9th, 00:45 UTC, holding steady from the previous day. This number isn’t just a random figure; it’s a powerful signal pointing towards one dominant market phase – Bitcoin Season . Let’s dive deep into what this means for you and the broader crypto ecosystem. Unveiling the Mystery: What is the Altcoin Season Index? Imagine a barometer for the crypto market, but instead of measuring atmospheric pressure, it measures the comparative strength of altcoins against Bitcoin. That’s essentially what the Altcoin Season Index is. Tracked diligently by CoinMarketCap, this metric provides valuable insights into whether altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin or vice versa. It’s a crucial tool for traders and investors looking to understand the prevailing market sentiment and potentially adjust their strategies. Here’s a breakdown of how this fascinating index works: Scope: The index considers the top 100 cryptocurrencies listed on CoinMarketCap. This excludes stablecoins, which are designed to maintain a stable value, and wrapped tokens, which represent other cryptocurrencies on different blockchains. This focused approach ensures the index accurately reflects the performance of true altcoins relative to Bitcoin. Timeframe: It analyzes the price performance of these top 100 coins over the past 90 days. This 90-day window provides a medium-term perspective, smoothing out short-term volatility and revealing more significant market trends. The Core Calculation: The index checks how many of these top 100 coins have outperformed Bitcoin in terms of price percentage gain over the last 90 days. Season Thresholds: This is where it gets interesting. The index uses a critical threshold of 75% to differentiate between market seasons: Altcoin Season: To officially declare an Altcoin Season, at least 75% of the top 100 coins must have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. This signifies a period where altcoins, as a whole, are experiencing stronger growth momentum compared to Bitcoin. Bitcoin Season: Conversely, Bitcoin Season is declared when 25% or fewer of the top 100 coins manage to outperform Bitcoin during the same 90-day period. This indicates Bitcoin’s dominance and relatively stronger performance compared to the majority of altcoins. Index Score: The Altcoin Season Index score ranges from 1 to 100. A higher score indicates a stronger Altcoin Season, while a lower score points towards Bitcoin Season. A score of 16, as we are currently seeing, firmly places us in Bitcoin territory. Bitcoin Season vs. Altcoin Season: Understanding the Dynamics So, what exactly does it mean when the market is in Bitcoin Season versus Altcoin Season ? Understanding the nuances of these phases is crucial for making informed decisions in the volatile crypto market. Bitcoin Season: The Reign of the King During Bitcoin Season , Bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, takes center stage. It tends to outperform most altcoins, often leading market rallies and corrections. Here’s what characterizes Bitcoin Season: Bitcoin Dominance: Bitcoin’s market capitalization dominance tends to increase as investors flock to the relative safety and established reputation of Bitcoin. Risk-Off Sentiment: Bitcoin Season often coincides with periods of market uncertainty or risk-off sentiment. Investors may rotate profits from riskier altcoins back into Bitcoin as a perceived safe haven within the crypto space. Capital Consolidation: Capital tends to consolidate in Bitcoin, leading to potentially slower growth or even corrections in the altcoin market. Focus on Fundamentals: During Bitcoin Season, the market often focuses on Bitcoin’s fundamental strengths, such as its scarcity, decentralization, and store of value narrative. Altcoin Season: The Rise of the Alternatives In contrast, Altcoin Season is when the spotlight shifts to alternative cryptocurrencies. Altcoins, ranging from Ethereum to smaller, emerging projects, experience significant growth and investor interest. Key features of Altcoin Season include: Altcoin Outperformance: As the name suggests, altcoins generally outperform Bitcoin, often by significant margins. This is driven by various factors, including new technological developments, increased adoption of specific altcoin ecosystems, and shifts in market narratives. Risk-On Sentiment: Altcoin Season often occurs during periods of market exuberance and risk-on sentiment. Investors are more willing to explore higher-risk, higher-reward altcoins in search of exponential gains. Capital Rotation: Profits from Bitcoin may rotate into altcoins, fueling their price surges. This can be triggered by Bitcoin reaching a perceived peak or investors seeking higher percentage gains than Bitcoin might offer at that stage. Narrative and Hype Cycles: Altcoin Season can be heavily influenced by emerging narratives and hype cycles around specific sectors within the crypto space, such as DeFi, NFTs, or Layer-2 solutions. Current Crypto Market Analysis: Why Bitcoin Season Now? With the Altcoin Season Index stubbornly low at 16, the data clearly indicates we are currently navigating a Bitcoin Season . But what factors are contributing to this market phase? Several elements could be at play: Macroeconomic Uncertainty: Global economic conditions, including inflation concerns, interest rate hikes, and geopolitical instability, often drive investors towards perceived safe-haven assets. In the crypto world, Bitcoin, despite its volatility, is often viewed as a more established and less risky asset compared to many altcoins, especially during turbulent times. Bitcoin ETF Momentum: The launch and increasing adoption of Bitcoin ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) in various markets have provided traditional investors with easier access to Bitcoin. This influx of institutional and retail capital into Bitcoin can strengthen its dominance and contribute to Bitcoin Season. Altcoin Market Correction: After periods of significant altcoin rallies, a natural correction phase often ensues. Investors may take profits on altcoins and rotate back into Bitcoin, leading to a period of Bitcoin outperformance. Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased regulatory scrutiny in the crypto space can sometimes disproportionately affect altcoins, particularly those that are perceived as securities or operating in less regulated areas. This uncertainty can drive investors towards the relative regulatory clarity surrounding Bitcoin. Navigating Bitcoin Season: Opportunities and Strategies Bitcoin Season doesn’t necessarily mean the end of opportunities in the crypto market. In fact, it presents unique scenarios for savvy investors. Here are some potential strategies to consider during Bitcoin’s reign: Focus on Bitcoin Accumulation: Bitcoin Season can be an opportune time to accumulate more Bitcoin. If you believe in Bitcoin’s long-term potential, periods of Bitcoin dominance can offer relatively attractive entry points or opportunities to dollar-cost average into Bitcoin. Selective Altcoin Investing: While the broad market may be in Bitcoin Season, certain altcoins with strong fundamentals, innovative technologies, or unique use cases may still present investment opportunities. Conduct thorough research and identify altcoins that can potentially weather the Bitcoin Season and thrive in the long run. Look for projects with strong developer communities, real-world adoption, and solid tokenomics. Monitor Altcoin Season Index for Shifts: Keep a close eye on the Altcoin Season Index . A gradual increase in the index score could signal a potential shift towards Altcoin Season. Be prepared to adjust your portfolio accordingly when indicators suggest a change in market dynamics. Diversification and Risk Management: Regardless of the prevailing market season, diversification remains crucial. Maintain a balanced portfolio that includes Bitcoin, select altcoins, and potentially other asset classes. Implement robust risk management strategies, such as setting stop-loss orders and managing position sizes, to protect your capital in the volatile crypto market. Looking Ahead: Will Altcoin Season Return? The cyclical nature of the crypto market suggests that Bitcoin Season , like all market phases, is unlikely to last forever. The question isn’t *if* Altcoin Season will return, but *when*. Several factors could potentially trigger a shift back towards altcoin dominance: Innovation and New Narratives: Breakthrough innovations in the altcoin space, such as advancements in DeFi, NFTs, Metaverse technologies, or new blockchain solutions, can reignite investor interest and trigger a surge in altcoin valuations. The emergence of compelling new narratives can also shift market focus away from Bitcoin and towards specific altcoin sectors. Ethereum Ecosystem Developments: Ethereum, as the leading smart contract platform, plays a significant role in the altcoin market. Successful upgrades like the Merge and ongoing developments in Ethereum scaling solutions can boost confidence in the Ethereum ecosystem and drive renewed interest in Ethereum and related altcoins. Broader Crypto Market Expansion: Continued mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies, increased institutional participation, and favorable regulatory developments can create a more bullish environment for the entire crypto market, including altcoins. As the market matures and diversifies, altcoins may gain a larger share of overall market capitalization. Bitcoin Cycle Dynamics: Historically, Bitcoin has experienced cyclical bull and bear markets. After a period of Bitcoin dominance, capital may naturally rotate back into altcoins as investors seek higher growth potential and diversification. It’s crucial to remember that predicting market movements with certainty is impossible. However, by understanding indicators like the Altcoin Season Index , staying informed about market trends, and adapting your strategies accordingly, you can navigate the crypto landscape with greater confidence and potentially capitalize on opportunities regardless of whether it’s Bitcoin or Altcoin Season. Conclusion: Navigating the Crypto Seasons The Altcoin Season Index serves as a valuable compass in the often-turbulent seas of the crypto market. Currently signaling a Bitcoin Season with a score of 16, it highlights Bitcoin’s present dominance. Understanding the dynamics of Bitcoin and Altcoin Seasons, recognizing the contributing factors, and adapting your investment strategies are essential for navigating these market cycles successfully. While Bitcoin currently holds the reins, the crypto market is ever-evolving, and the winds of change can shift quickly. By staying informed, remaining adaptable, and focusing on long-term fundamentals, you can position yourself to thrive in any crypto season.

43110192,https://coinpedia.org/?p=441811,1744179088,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,Ripple Lawsuit News: SEC Says XRP Case Still Under Appeal While Ripple Claims It’s Settled,https://coinpedia.org/news/ripple-lawsuit-news-sec-says-xrp-case-still-under-appeal-while-ripple-claims-its-settled/,"The post Ripple Lawsuit News: SEC Says XRP Case Still Under Appeal While Ripple Claims It’s Settled appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In what may be the final chapter of the long-running legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently claimed that the case has been settled. According to Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer (CLO), the SEC has dropped its appeal, while Ripple has also decided to drop its cross-appeal. Additionally, Ripple will now only pay a $50 million fine, a significant reduction from the original $125 million penalty proposed earlier. However, despite these claims, the SEC has yet to confirm the settlement, leading to continued uncertainty about the case’s actual status. The SEC’s response has raised more questions than answers, particularly after it filed an opposition to an “emergency request to present decisive evidence” in favor of Ripple. This filing, submitted by a man named Justin W. Keener, is aimed at providing what he claims to be decisive evidence that could help Ripple in its case against the SEC. In the latest developments, the SEC has opposed Keener’s motion for several reasons. According to the SEC, the District Court no longer has jurisdiction over the request, as the case has already moved to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. The SEC also argues that Keener did not follow the proper legal procedures to intervene in the case and that Ripple itself is capable of deciding whether the evidence is useful to its case. The SEC is asking Judge Torres to deny the motion entirely. Attorney Bill Morgan pointed out an interesting detail in the SEC’s opposition filing. The SEC appeared to contradict Ripple’s recent claims of settlement by writing to Judge Torres that the case is still in the appeal process. This leaves the situation unclear—while Ripple insists the case is settled, the SEC maintains that the matter is still under appeal. This odd situation has sparked confusion and left many wondering what the actual status of the case is. Such an odd thing that Ripple say the Appeal and Cross-Appeal is settled but the SEC writes to Judge Torres that the matter is still on appeal. Settled but not quite over. https://t.co/TpNv2DcKoE pic.twitter.com/XFAKJAzUUP — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) April 9, 2025 With these conflicting statements, investors, legal experts, and XRP supporters are calling for clarification from the SEC.

Speaking from Paris Blockchain Week, where the news first broke, Kwok noted that the deal holds transformative potential for Ripple, XRP Ledger, and the broader digital asset ecosystem. “I’ve followed tons of deals in the crypto space, but Ripple’s acquisition of Hidden Road is undoubtedly one of the most significant,” Kwok said on X. “This makes Ripple the first crypto company to own and operate a global, multi-asset prime broker.” The acquisition, reportedly valued at $1.25 billion, allows Ripple to offer full-service trading and clearing solutions that rival those of Wall Street’s most prominent financial institutions, according to Kwok. Hidden Road, which processes over $3 trillion in transactions annually and serves over 300 institutional clients, will now become a central pillar of Ripple’s efforts to bring institutional-grade services to the crypto world.

Now, this will run on the XRP Ledger,” he added. According to Kwok, one of the key benefits of the acquisition is that Hidden Road’s operations will be deeply integrated into Ripple’s ecosystem. All transactions made through Hidden Road will be moved to the XRP Ledger, while Ripple’s native stablecoin, RLUSD, will be used as collateral for the firm’s brokerage services. According to Kwok, this is expected to significantly increase real-world institutional adoption of both XRP Ledger and RLUSD, solidifying Ripple’s position as a leading infrastructure provider in the digital finance space. *This is not investment advice.

The proposal outlines both standard and preferential tax models, signalling a move to align the country’s financial system with global digital asset norms. Shared publicly on Telegram by Commission head Ruslan Magomedov on Tuesday, the proposal suggests a personal income tax rate of 18% and an additional 5% military levy on virtual asset gains. Introduced during wartime, the military levy functions as an additional tax to help fund the country’s defense efforts. Alternatively, the model includes preferential tax rates of 5% and 9% for certain categories. These recommendations draw on international examples and are tailored to fit within Ukraine’s legal framework. “In the digital age, taxation of cryptocurrencies is no longer a hypothesis – it’s a rapidly approaching reality,” Magomedov said. “That’s why the NSSMC has developed a matrix presenting various taxation options for virtual asset transactions – from mining to airdrops.” Ukraine is considering a 5-10% tax on crypto income, with legislation expected by mid-2025. The move looks to bolster state revenue while navigating regulatory hurdles. #CryptoRegulations #CryptoTax #Ukraine https://t.co/MbtXiYCWi3 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) February 28, 2025 Ukraine Looks Abroad for Guidance as It Builds Its Crypto Tax Framework The proposed rules define taxable income either as gross revenue or net income after expenses. Income would generally be recognized when received or when assets are exchanged for fiat currency or non-virtual goods and services. Transactions that involve only virtual assets would not trigger a tax under this model. The matrix references countries with more favorable treatment of crypto activity. Austria and France, for example, do not tax crypto-to-crypto exchanges. Singapore does not levy capital gains taxes on individuals or companies. Malaysia exempts transactions unless they are routine or business-related. Georgia offers full exemptions for individuals on income and capital gains from digital assets. Reports in February indicated that Ukrainian authorities were working on legislation to introduce a 5%-10% tax on crypto by mid-2025, aiming to boost state revenue and support military funding amid the ongoing war with Russia. Ukraine Clarifies VAT Treatment for Crypto Operations Like Mining and Staking The document also provides tax guidance on mining, staking, airdrops and hard forks. Activities like free token supply, token creation, and storing virtual assets would not be subject to VAT. However, rewards or services that involve token modification or crypto payments for goods and services may be taxed. Some of these transactions may qualify for exemptions under Article 135 of the EU VAT Directive. This applies especially if they are considered payment-related services. The Commission noted that this classification may need additional interpretation and legal guidance. Ukraine’s effort to establish a clear tax policy for virtual assets comes at a time of economic strain and heightened interest in digital finance. The Commission has already introduced the matrix to lawmakers and now plans to engage directly with market participants as part of its regulatory development process.
