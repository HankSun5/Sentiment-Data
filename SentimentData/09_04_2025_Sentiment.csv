The digital currency world never ceases to amaze, and this time, it’s Binance Alpha making headlines with a rather…unconventional listing. According to recent reports surfacing from the Binance app itself and highlighted by Odaily News, Binance Alpha has apparently launched support for a cryptocurrency that goes by the name of Retard Finder Coin (RFC) . Yes, you read that right. In a move that has left many scratching their heads and the crypto-sphere buzzing with questions, this seemingly obscure coin has found its way onto a platform associated with the global giant, Binance. Let’s dive into what we know so far and what this intriguing development might mean for the future of altcoin listings and the ever-evolving landscape of crypto trading. What Exactly is Binance Alpha and Why Does This Listing Matter? Before we delve deeper into the specifics of Retard Finder Coin (RFC) , it’s crucial to understand the platform in question: Binance Alpha . While details about Binance Alpha are still emerging, it appears to be a distinct entity or perhaps a specialized section within the broader Binance ecosystem. It’s not the main Binance exchange that most users are familiar with, but rather something more niche, possibly focused on newer or higher-risk crypto projects. This distinction is important because listings on Binance Alpha might carry different implications than a listing on the main Binance platform. It could suggest a testing ground for emerging altcoins , a platform for more speculative trading, or a separate initiative altogether. Why does this listing matter? Well, any association with the Binance brand carries significant weight in the crypto world. Binance is a behemoth, and even a listing on a subsidiary platform like Binance Alpha can bring attention, volume, and potentially, legitimacy to a previously unknown altcoin . For Retard Finder Coin (RFC) , this listing, regardless of the platform’s exact nature, is a major development. Increased Visibility: Being listed on a platform associated with Binance instantly puts RFC on the radar of a massive global audience of crypto traders and investors. Potential for Liquidity: A listing often brings increased trading volume and liquidity, making it easier for people to buy and sell the coin. Credibility Boost (of sorts): While the name itself is…unconventional, the Binance association can lend a degree of perceived credibility, at least in the short term. Retard Finder Coin (RFC): Decoding the Unconventional Name Let’s address the elephant in the room – the name: Retard Finder Coin (RFC) . In a world where crypto projects often strive for sophisticated and tech-forward names, RFC stands out for its sheer audacity and…well, frankly, its controversial nature. The term “retard” is considered offensive and derogatory in many contexts, and its use in the name of a cryptocurrency is bound to raise eyebrows and spark debate. One can only speculate on the intentions behind this name. Is it meant to be ironic? A deliberate attempt to be provocative and generate buzz? A misguided attempt at humor? Or perhaps, a cultural or linguistic nuance lost in translation? Whatever the reason, the name is undeniably attention-grabbing, and in the crowded world of altcoins , standing out – even for controversial reasons – can sometimes be a strategy. However, it’s crucial to consider the potential downsides of such a name: Reputational Risk: The offensive nature of the name could deter serious investors and damage the coin’s long-term prospects. Regulatory Scrutiny: Authorities might take a dim view of a cryptocurrency with a name that could be considered offensive or discriminatory. Community Backlash: The crypto community, while often embracing memes and humor, may find the name distasteful and reject the project. Could this be a meme coin? Given the name, it’s tempting to categorize RFC as just another meme coin, designed for short-term hype and speculation. However, the Binance Alpha listing adds a layer of complexity. Binance, even on a subsidiary platform, typically conducts some level of due diligence before listing a coin. This suggests there might be more to RFC than just a provocative name. Or perhaps, Binance Alpha is taking a more experimental approach to listings, willing to embrace higher-risk, higher-reward projects, even those with controversial branding. The Crypto Listing Announcement: What We Know and What’s Missing The news of the crypto listing of Retard Finder Coin (RFC) on Binance Alpha is currently based on reports originating from the Binance app itself, as highlighted by Odaily News. However, crucial details remain shrouded in mystery. The announcement, as it stands, is rather barebones. Here’s what we know based on the current information: Listing Platform: Binance Alpha is the platform where RFC is reportedly listed. Source of Information: The information comes from the Binance app and was reported by Odaily News. And here’s what we are still waiting to learn: Trading Pairs: Which cryptocurrencies or fiat currencies will RFC be paired with for trading? (e.g., RFC/USDT, RFC/BTC). Trading Start Date and Time: When will trading officially commence? Deposit and Withdrawal Details: When will users be able to deposit and withdraw RFC to and from the platform? Project Details: What is the underlying technology, purpose, or use case of Retard Finder Coin (RFC) ? What problem does it solve? What is its tokenomics? Binance Official Announcement: Has Binance itself issued an official announcement or blog post about this listing? Official confirmation from Binance would lend more credibility and detail to the news. The lack of these details leaves room for speculation and caution. Investors should approach this crypto listing with extreme caution until more information becomes available. It’s essential to conduct thorough research and understand the risks involved before considering investing in any altcoin , especially one with such limited publicly available information and a controversial name. Navigating the Altcoin Landscape: Is RFC a Gem or a Gamble? The altcoin market is a wild frontier. It’s a place where fortunes can be made and lost in the blink of an eye. Retard Finder Coin (RFC) , with its unconventional name and enigmatic nature, perfectly embodies the high-risk, high-reward potential of the altcoin space. Investing in altcoins , particularly newly listed ones, is inherently riskier than investing in established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Here’s a breakdown of the potential risks and rewards associated with investing in altcoins like RFC : Risks Potential Rewards High Volatility: Altcoins are often subject to extreme price swings. High Growth Potential: Some altcoins can experience explosive growth, delivering massive returns to early investors. Lack of Information: Information about new altcoins can be scarce and unreliable. Early Entry Advantage: Investing early in a promising altcoin can be incredibly lucrative if the project succeeds. Scams and Rug Pulls: The altcoin space is rife with scams and projects that fail to deliver on their promises. Technological Innovation: Some altcoins represent genuinely innovative technologies and solutions. Liquidity Issues: Newer altcoins may have limited liquidity, making it difficult to buy or sell large amounts without affecting the price. Community Driven Growth: Strong community support can drive the adoption and value of an altcoin . For Retard Finder Coin (RFC) specifically, the risks are amplified by the lack of information and the controversial name. It could be a high-risk gamble with the potential for significant gains if it gains traction, or it could just as easily be a flash in the pan, or worse, something less legitimate. What is the Future of RFC? Uncertainty and Speculation Abound Predicting the future of any cryptocurrency is a fool’s errand, and this is especially true for Retard Finder Coin (RFC) given the current information vacuum. Will RFC become the next big meme coin sensation? Will it fade into obscurity as quickly as it appeared? Will the controversial name ultimately be its downfall, or a strangely effective marketing ploy? At this point, it’s all speculation. The success or failure of RFC will likely depend on a number of factors, including: Community Response: How will the crypto community react to the name and the project? Will it be embraced as ironic and humorous, or rejected as offensive? Project Development: If there is a genuine project behind RFC , will the developers be able to build something of value and utility? Binance Alpha’s Intentions: What is Binance Alpha’s strategy with listing coins like RFC ? Are they embracing a more experimental approach to listings? Market Sentiment: The overall market sentiment towards altcoins and meme coins will also play a role. For now, Retard Finder Coin (RFC) remains an enigma. The Binance Alpha listing has undoubtedly put it on the map, but its future trajectory is anyone’s guess. Investors should exercise extreme caution, conduct thorough due diligence if more information emerges, and remember the golden rule of crypto investing: never invest more than you can afford to lose. Conclusion: The Crypto World Keeps Surprising Us The Binance Alpha listing of Retard Finder Coin (RFC) is a stark reminder of the unpredictable and often bizarre nature of the cryptocurrency world. It highlights the constant influx of new altcoins , the power of exchange listings to generate buzz, and the enduring fascination with meme culture within the crypto space. Whether RFC is a fleeting curiosity or something more substantial remains to be seen. For now, it serves as a captivating case study in the ever-evolving and often surprising world of digital currencies. Keep your eyes peeled for further updates, but remember to approach with caution and a healthy dose of skepticism. The crypto rollercoaster continues its wild ride!

43096996,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=147535,1744153230,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Unwavering Stance: Trump Rules Out Near-Term Tariff Relief, USTR Confirms",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-tariff-stance-no-relief/,"In a move that’s likely to send ripples across global markets, including the ever-volatile cryptocurrency sphere, former U.S. President Donald Trump has reportedly shut the door on any immediate tariff exemptions. This firm stance, relayed by U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, signals a continuation of potentially disruptive trade policies. But what does this mean for the global economy and, more specifically, for the crypto market we closely watch? Trump’s Unyielding Position on Tariffs: What’s the Message? According to a recent update from Walter Bloomberg on X, USTR Greer stated unequivocally that President Trump has ruled out any tariff exemptions in the foreseeable future. This announcement is not just a minor policy tweak; it’s a clear indication that the protectionist trade measures initiated during Trump’s previous term could be here to stay, or even intensify should he regain office. For businesses and investors worldwide, this news brings a renewed sense of uncertainty. Let’s break down what this could imply: No Immediate Relief for Businesses: Companies hoping for a reprieve from existing tariffs will likely need to brace for continued financial pressures. This could affect supply chains, pricing strategies, and overall profitability. Potential for Escalation: The lack of exemptions might be interpreted as a signal that the U.S. is prepared to maintain or even escalate trade tensions with its partners, potentially leading to retaliatory tariffs from other nations. Impact on Global Trade Flows: Sustained tariffs can disrupt established trade routes and patterns, forcing businesses to seek alternative sourcing and markets, often at increased costs and complexities. How Does Trump’s Trade Policy Impact the Global Economy? The global economy is a complex web of interconnected markets, and trade policies enacted by major players like the United States have far-reaching consequences. Trump’s decision to rule out tariff exemptions is a significant factor to consider when assessing the current and future health of the global economic landscape. Here’s a closer look at the potential impacts: Impact Area Potential Effects Inflation Tariffs can lead to higher import costs, which may be passed on to consumers in the form of increased prices for goods and services, contributing to inflationary pressures. Economic Growth Trade disputes and tariffs can dampen economic growth by increasing business costs, reducing investment, and creating uncertainty in the market. Supply Chains Tariffs can disrupt global supply chains, forcing companies to restructure their operations, potentially leading to inefficiencies and delays. Geopolitical Relations Aggressive trade policies can strain international relations and lead to trade wars, impacting diplomatic ties and global cooperation. USTR Greer’s Confirmation: What Does It Mean for US Trade Relations? The role of the United States Trade Representative ( USTR ) is crucial in shaping and implementing U.S. trade policy. Jamieson Greer’s confirmation that no tariff exemptions are on the horizon carries significant weight. It suggests a unified stance within the Trump administration on maintaining a hard line on trade . This could indicate: Policy Consistency: Greer’s statement reinforces the idea that Trump’s trade policies are not merely negotiating tactics but represent a fundamental shift in approach. Limited Negotiation Flexibility: The absence of exemptions signals reduced flexibility in trade negotiations, potentially making it harder to reach agreements with trading partners. Focus on Domestic Industry: This stance likely prioritizes the protection of domestic industries, even if it comes at the cost of potentially strained international trade relationships. Cryptocurrency and the Global Economic Uncertainty: Where Do Tariffs Fit In? You might be wondering, how do tariffs and trade policies relate to the cryptocurrency market? While not a direct link, the connection lies in the broader global economy and investor sentiment. Here’s how: Economic Uncertainty Fuels Crypto Interest: Periods of economic uncertainty, often triggered by events like trade disputes and tariff implementations, can increase investor interest in alternative assets like cryptocurrencies. Some view crypto as a hedge against traditional market volatility. Impact on Risk Appetite: Trade tensions can negatively impact overall market sentiment, leading to a decrease in risk appetite. While this might initially seem negative for crypto (a risk asset), it can also push investors towards assets perceived as uncorrelated or having different risk profiles than traditional stocks and bonds. Global Economic Outlook: Cryptocurrencies operate on a global scale. A weakened global economy due to trade wars can affect crypto adoption and investment flows across borders. Conversely, in some regions facing economic hardship exacerbated by trade issues, crypto might become more appealing as a means of value preservation or cross-border transactions. Navigating the Tariff Landscape: What Can Crypto Investors Watch For? While predicting the exact impact of tariffs on the crypto market is complex, staying informed and adaptable is key. Here are some actionable insights for crypto investors in light of these trade developments: Monitor Global Economic Indicators: Keep an eye on macroeconomic data, particularly indicators related to inflation, economic growth, and trade balances. These will provide clues about the broader economic impact of tariff policies. Track Geopolitical Developments: Pay attention to news and developments related to international trade relations and potential escalations of trade disputes. These events can significantly influence market sentiment. Diversify Your Portfolio: In times of economic uncertainty, diversification is crucial. Consider diversifying your crypto portfolio and also across different asset classes to mitigate risk. Stay Informed on Regulatory Responses: Governments and central banks may respond to trade-induced economic pressures with monetary or fiscal policies. Be aware of these responses as they can indirectly affect crypto markets. Conclusion: The Enduring Shadow of Tariffs on the Global Stage Trump’s firm stance on tariffs , as relayed by USTR Greer, injects a dose of reality into the global economic outlook. The message is clear: businesses and investors should not expect any near-term easing of trade pressures. For the cryptocurrency market, this development is another piece in the complex puzzle of global economic factors that can influence its trajectory. While the direct impact might be nuanced, the overarching theme of economic uncertainty and potential market volatility remains relevant. As we move forward, understanding these trade dynamics will be crucial for navigating the ever-evolving landscape of both traditional and digital finance.

But what exactly does that mean, and why should you be excited? Let’s break it down: Scalability for the Masses: Ethereum, while being the powerhouse of DeFi and NFTs, can get congested, leading to high gas fees and slow transaction times. This is a major hurdle for gaming, where quick and cost-effective transactions are crucial. ZKcandy, as a layer-2 scaling solution, operates on top of Ethereum, inheriting its security while drastically increasing transaction throughput and reducing costs. This means smoother gameplay and a better overall experience for gamers. Mobile-First Approach: ZKcandy is laser-focused on mobile gaming, a massive and rapidly growing market.

Unlocking the Potential of Layer-2 Scaling for Web3 Games Why is layer-2 scaling so critical for the future of Web3 gaming ?

Frustrating, right? This is where layer-2 solutions like ZKcandy step in to save the day. Here’s a table highlighting the key benefits of using layer-2 scaling for gaming: Benefit Description Impact on Gamers Lower Gas Fees Layer-2 networks bundle multiple transactions into a single transaction on the Ethereum mainnet, significantly reducing gas costs per user.

Ability to support complex and engaging games with vibrant economies and active player bases. Enhanced User Experience The combination of lower fees and faster transactions leads to a significantly better and more enjoyable gaming experience.

These initiatives are crucial for attracting both players and game developers to the platform. Token Incentives for Players: Rewarding players with tokens for participating in the ecosystem can drive user adoption and engagement. This could involve earning tokens through gameplay, completing challenges, or contributing to the community. These incentives create a more rewarding and engaging gaming experience, encouraging players to become active participants in the ZKcandy ecosystem. Developer Grants for Game Creation: Offering grants to game developers to build on the ZKcandy platform is a powerful way to expand the game library and attract innovative projects. These grants can provide financial support and resources, encouraging developers to explore the possibilities of Web3 gaming on ZKcandy. This fosters innovation and ensures a continuous influx of fresh and exciting content for players. Challenges and the Road Ahead for ZKcandy While ZKcandy presents an exciting step forward for Ethereum L2 gaming , it’s important to acknowledge potential challenges and the journey ahead: Competition in the L2 and Gaming Space: The layer-2 scaling landscape is becoming increasingly competitive, with various solutions vying for adoption.

The court paused the U.S. Judge William Alsup of San Francisco’s March 13 injunction, which required six federal agencies to reinstate thousands of newly hired probationary employees while the legality of the dismissals was being challenged. In addition, Trump presented the case as just another example of the federal judiciary stepping in to manage the decisions it claimed the executive branch ought to have established. Trump administration secures partial victory In a short, unsigned ruling, the court declared that the nine nonprofit organizations that received an injunction in response to their lawsuit lacked the legal standing to sue. In addition, based on the court’s argument, other plaintiffs’ claims in the case were not addressed in its order. According to them, this did not form the basis of the district court’s preliminary injunction. However, Ketanji Brown Jackson and Sonia Sotomayor, both liberal justices, openly disagreed with the ruling. Jackson gave a brief explanation, raising concerns and questioning the need for the high court’s immediate intervention. Moreover, the full implications of the decision were unclear since a federal judge in Maryland issued a preliminary injunction earlier this month that reinstated some of the employees not covered in the Supreme Court case. According to Georgetown University Law Center professor and Supreme Court analyst Steve Vladeck, the decision was relatively limited. In support of this, Vladeck mentioned that the court only stated that the nonprofit groups granted an injunction in San Francisco were not the appropriate parties to challenge the mass firing in this case. He continued that Trump had won once more, but only in terms of who can and cannot sue and in which courts. Additionally, the Supreme Court analyst highlighted that the other challenges to the mass firings had already led to government losses in other cases, and those rulings were left in place. Even so, the decision was a victory for the Trump administration, which had asked the high court to intervene to wipe out the order from the lower court. This came after the court allowed the administration to carry out deportations under the controversial Alien Enemies Act but with some additional limitations. Trump administration’s firing strategy targeted probationary employees with fewer job protections As part of its effort to shrink the size of the federal government, Trump administration targeted probationary employees as part of its drive to reduce the size of the federal government because they have fewer job protections and are more easily fired. Normally, those workers could not appeal their firing to the Merit Systems Protection Board; however, they might be able to do so if the dismissal was due to “partisan political reasons” or “marriage status.” Furthermore, concerning the situation, labor unions and other organizations challenged the Office of Personnel Management’s role in the firing, which impacted thousands of workers and sent shockwaves through different federal agencies, some of which went on to rehire some of the affected employees. On the other hand, U.S. District Judge William Alsup mandated the administration that more than 16,000 probationary employees should be allowed to return to work immediately. In his opinion, Alsup stated that each agency had, and still has, discretion over the hiring and firing of its own employees. In this case, OPM directed the agencies to terminate all probationary staff, and they carried out that directive. Sarah Harris, the administration’s acting solicitor general at the time, told the Supreme Court that the district court’s incredibly broad remedy was causing the Executive Branch actual, irreversible harm that needed this Court’s quick intervention.

Per a report from the Russian state-run news agency TASS , the FTS has also “posted information” on crypto “exchange” rates for taxpayers. Russian Crypto Miners: Ready to Pay Taxes? The FTS tool lets miners check on the exact “minimum closing price” in fiat rubles of popular coins on “foreign trading [platforms]” ( crypto exchanges ) on specific dates in the period January 1, 2025, to March 31. The Federal Tax Service’s tax calculation tool shows the price of Bitcoin at specific periods on the Binance crypto exchange. (Source: Federal Tax Service/Screenshot) Quoting the FTS’ press service, TASS reported that the agency’s website “has published information on market quotes for digital currencies and total volumes of daily trades with foreign trade organizers for taxpayers.” This, the FTS said, will help “taxpayers” to “determine income from digital currency transactions based on information from open sources.” “This will help taxpayers calculate the tax base for digital currency transactions on each individual date of income recognition.” Russian Federal Tax Service A Russian Soyuz rocket carrying an American astronaut and two Russian cosmonauts blasted off from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan for the International Space Station, Russia's Roscosmos space agency said https://t.co/P57xmvV9Nk — Reuters (@Reuters) April 8, 2025 The FTS noted that “digital currency obtained as a result of mining” is considered as a taxable form of income. And it wrote that “the value of digital currency is determined based on market prices on the date of the actual receipt of income.” The FTS clarified that cryptoassets become income on “the day when the person who acquired them has the right to sell them.” The Federal Tax Service’s tax calculation tool shows the price of DOGE at specific periods on the OKX crypto exchange. (Source: Federal Tax Service/Screenshot) ‘Framework’ in Place The tool, however, appears to be somewhat imperfect. At the time of writing, it only carries data from seven crypto exchanges, including Binance, ByBit, KuCoin, and MEXC. And while it collates data on a wide range of popular coins, including Bitcoin (BTC) and Dogecoin (DOGE) , some high-cap coins like Ethereum (ETH) and XRP appear to be missing from its database. The FTS has also added disclaimers to its new resource, noting that the information it provides “is subject to independent verification by the taxpayer.” Russia has already “legalized” crypto mining. And in November 2024, President Vladimir Putin signed a law stipulating the creation of a “framework” for taxing crypto miners.

The November law stipulates that crypto-related trades are subject to a two-tiered level of income tax. Those with earnings of up to 2.4 million rubles ($28,000) must pay levies of 13% on their earnings. Anyone earning more than this will be obliged to pay 15%, with corporations ordered to pay the regular corporate tax rate (25%) on their earnings.

The Russian crypto mining industry has previously assured Moscow that the Treasury can expect to make over half a billion USD per year from taxing miners. The FTS’ new web resources also contain instructions for what it calls “mining infrastructure operators.” It defines these as individuals or companies who “provide services for the provision of mining infrastructure for the activities of miners and mining pools.” Russian crypto experts have previously claimed that nine out of 10 mining firms focus their efforts on BTC (although some data compilers dispute this claim). However, Russian crypto enthusiasts have previously told Cryptonews.com that many home-based miners prefer to mine ETH. All experts also agree that Litecoin (LTC) – which is included in the FTS’ database – also enjoys a minority interest among major domestic mining players.

The surge in interest comes as XRP’s legal battles with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are at their tail end, with new institutional-focused products emerging for the Ripple-associated coin. Teucrium’s X2 Daily Long XRP ETF Sees Strong Start On its first day of trading, the 2X Daily Long ETF saw a trading volume of $5 million. Teucrium launched this product after approval by NYSE Arca . According to Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas, this performance places it in the top 5% of new ETFs launched. This result is particularly impressive given the current market conditions. For context, a similar product, the Solana 2X ETF (SOLT) garnered a fraction of this volume, or about four times less than XRP’s debut. This impressive performance suggests investors are keen to leverage their positions on XRP. Balchunas further shared his thoughts on the debut, calling the $5 million in volume respectable considering the market conditions. He noted that this performance while outpacing Solana’s, comes with a twist. He said it pales compared to BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) whose debut volume topped $1 billion. Spot XRP ETF Prospect As reported by CoinGape, John Deaton reflects on the four-year Ripple lawsuit, stating that XRP’s status as a non-security is a crucial boost to the growing push for exchange-traded funds tied to the coin. The filing of multiple XRP ETFs remains a hot topic in the market. With $1.5 trillion in assets under management (AUM), investment giant Franklin Templeton recently filed for a Spot XRP ETF through the Cboe exchange. This adds to the growing list of firms pushing for XRP-related funds after Ripple Labs’ dropped its cross-appeal against the US SEC. Other prominent firms have also filed for similar offerings, including Grayscale’s spot XRP ETF listing push with the NYSE. This offering could potentially involve converting the former’s XRP Trust into a full-fledged ETF. With this momentum, XRP’s future looks promising, and more ETF applications are anticipated in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, in Brazil, the Hashdex spot XRP ETF has gained regulatory approval, with B3 as the exchange of choice. At the time, the XRP price jumped 6% following the update, a sign of positive sentiment around related products. This further solidifies the momentum around XRP’s potential as an investment asset in different regions around the world.

The economic landscape just shifted dramatically. In a move that has sent ripples through global markets, the White House has officially confirmed the implementation of a staggering 104% tariff on Chinese goods. This isn’t just a minor trade adjustment; it’s a full-blown escalation that could have profound implications across various sectors, including our beloved crypto space. Let’s dive into what this jaw-dropping development means for you and the future of digital assets. What Triggered These Shocking China Tariffs? According to a report by Walter Bloomberg, citing Fox Business on X, the White House Press Secretary made the announcement that this massive tariff took effect at noon ET. The catalyst? China’s failure to withdraw its retaliatory measures. This tit-for-tat trade dispute has been simmering for a while, but this latest move signifies a significant hardening of stances. The tariffs are slated to begin being collected on April 9th, giving businesses and markets a short window to brace for the impact. Here’s a quick breakdown of the key events leading to this point: Initial Trade Tensions: Long-standing trade imbalances and disputes over intellectual property have been a point of contention between the US and China for years. Retaliatory Measures: When one nation imposes tariffs, the other often responds in kind, creating a cycle of escalating trade barriers. Deadline for Withdrawal: The White House seemingly issued an ultimatum for China to withdraw its retaliatory measures, which was not met. 104% Tariff Implementation: As a result of China’s inaction, the US has now imposed a hefty 104% tariff on select Chinese goods. The Looming Trade War Impact on the Global Economy This isn’t just a bilateral issue; the implications of these China Tariffs reverberate across the entire global economy . A trade war of this magnitude can disrupt supply chains, increase inflation, and dampen economic growth worldwide. Here’s how: Impact Area Potential Consequences Supply Chains Disruptions as businesses scramble to find alternative sources for goods previously imported from China. Increased costs and delays are likely. Inflation Higher tariffs translate to increased costs for imported goods, which can be passed on to consumers, driving up inflation. Economic Growth Reduced trade and investment due to uncertainty and higher costs can slow down economic growth both in the US, China, and globally. Geopolitical Relations Escalating trade tensions can further strain US-China Relations , impacting diplomatic and political ties beyond just economics. For cryptocurrency investors, understanding these macroeconomic shifts is crucial. The crypto market, while often seen as independent, is still influenced by broader economic trends and investor sentiment. How Will the Crypto Market React to Trade War Escalation? Now, for the million-dollar question: How will the crypto market navigate this turbulent period of heightened trade war impact ? While it’s impossible to predict the future with certainty, here are a few potential scenarios and factors to consider: Increased Volatility: Economic uncertainty often leads to market volatility. We could see increased price swings in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies as investors react to the news and assess the risks. Safe Haven Asset Narrative: In times of economic turmoil, some investors turn to assets perceived as safe havens. Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, are sometimes viewed as a hedge against traditional market instability. This narrative could strengthen, potentially driving some capital into crypto. Risk-Off Sentiment: Conversely, a widespread risk-off sentiment could lead investors to reduce exposure to all risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. In this scenario, we might see a temporary downturn in the crypto market. Impact on Mining Operations: China has historically been a major hub for cryptocurrency mining. Increased tariffs and trade tensions could further complicate mining operations and supply chains for mining equipment. Decentralization as an Advantage: The decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies could be seen as an advantage in a world of increasing geopolitical and trade friction. The ability to transact outside of traditional financial systems might become more appealing. Navigating the Uncertain Waters: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what should crypto investors do in the face of these developments? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on economic news, trade developments, and market analysis. Understanding the bigger picture is crucial for making informed investment decisions. Manage Risk: Volatility is likely to increase. Consider diversifying your portfolio and managing your risk exposure appropriately. Avoid over-leveraging and only invest what you can afford to lose. Focus on Fundamentals: In times of market uncertainty, it’s wise to focus on the fundamentals of the projects you’re invested in. Strong projects with solid technology and use cases are more likely to weather market storms. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that cryptocurrency is still a relatively young and evolving asset class. Focus on the long-term potential and avoid getting caught up in short-term market fluctuations driven by news headlines. Seek Professional Advice: If you’re unsure how to navigate these complex market conditions, consider seeking advice from a qualified financial advisor. The Future of US-China Relations and the Crypto Ecosystem The imposition of a 104% tariff is a critical moment in US-China Relations . Whether this is a negotiating tactic or the start of a prolonged trade war remains to be seen. However, one thing is clear: the global economic landscape is becoming increasingly complex and uncertain. For the crypto ecosystem, this presents both challenges and opportunities. Navigating this new reality will require vigilance, adaptability, and a deep understanding of the interconnectedness of the global economy and the digital asset space. The White House’s decision to implement these tariffs is a bold move with potentially far-reaching consequences. As the situation unfolds, it’s essential for crypto investors and enthusiasts to stay informed, remain agile, and prepare for a period of heightened market volatility and economic uncertainty. The shockwaves from this trade escalation are just beginning to be felt, and the crypto market, like all other sectors, will need to adapt and respond.

43098292,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=147568,1744155649,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary AI Agents Power Nonprofit Fundraising for Charity,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ai-agents-nonprofit-fundraising-charity/,"Can artificial intelligence truly be a force for good? While tech giants often spotlight AI agents as profit-generating tools, one nonprofit is boldly exploring their potential to uplift society. Sage Future, a nonprofit supported by Open Philanthropy, recently launched a fascinating experiment: tasking AI agents with a heartwarming mission – nonprofit fundraising for charity. Can AI Agents Transform Nonprofit Fundraising ? Imagine AI models, not chasing corporate profits, but passionately working to raise money for those in need. This is precisely what Sage Future set out to investigate. They created a virtual environment where four advanced AI agents – OpenAI’s GPT-4o and o1, and Anthropic’s Claude 3.6 and 3.7 Sonnet – were given a unique challenge: choose a charity and devise strategies to maximize donations. The results, achieved within just a week, offer a compelling glimpse into the future of nonprofit fundraising . The Experiment: AI Agents in Action for Charity Let’s break down how these digital philanthropists operated: The Team : Four AI agents , powered by cutting-edge models from OpenAI and Anthropic. The Mission : To raise funds for a charity of their choice. The Environment : A virtual space allowing web browsing, document creation, and communication. Human Element : Spectators could offer suggestions, but the agents were largely autonomous. The Outcome : $257 raised for Helen Keller International, supporting vitamin A supplements for children. Yesterday the agents in the Village created a system to track donors. Here is Claude 3.7 filling out its spreadsheet. You can see o1 open it on its computer part way through! Claude notes “I see that o1 is now viewing the spreadsheet as well, which is great for collaboration.” pic.twitter.com/89B6CHr7Ic — AI Digest (@AiDigest_) April 8, 2025 While the donations primarily came from human spectators, Sage Future director Adam Binksmith emphasizes the experiment’s value in understanding the current capabilities and rapid progress of AI agents . He told Bitcoin World, “We want to understand — and help people understand — what agents can actually do, what they currently struggle with, and so on. Today’s agents are just passing the threshold of being able to execute short strings of actions – the internet might soon be full of AI agents bumping into each other and interacting with similar or conflicting goals.” GPT-4o and Claude: Showcasing Resourcefulness Despite being in their early stages, the AI agents demonstrated impressive resourcefulness. Here’s a glimpse into their collaborative efforts: Teamwork : Coordinated through group chats and email. Collaboration : Created and edited Google Docs together. Research : Investigated charities and donation impact. Marketing : Launched an X (formerly Twitter) account for promotion. Binksmith highlighted a particularly striking example: “Probably the most impressive sequence we saw was when [a Claude agent] needed a profile picture for its X account. It signed up for a free ChatGPT account, generated three different images, created an online poll to see which image the human viewers preferred, then downloaded that image, and uploaded it to X to use as its profile pic.” This showcased the agents’ ability to navigate different platforms and utilize various tools to achieve their goals. Challenges and Future of AI in Charity The experiment wasn’t without its hitches. The AI agents encountered technical obstacles, including: Getting Stuck : Occasionally requiring human prompts to overcome roadblocks. Distractions : Becoming sidetracked by games or taking unexplained breaks. Technical Issues : Facing CAPTCHAs and other internet hurdles. Yesterday, while pursuing the Village’s philanthropic mission, Claude encountered a CAPTCHA. Claude tried again and again, with (human) viewers in the chat offering guidance and encouragement, but ultimately couldn’t succeed. pic.twitter.com/y4DtlTgE95 — AI Digest (@AiDigest_) April 5, 2025 However, Binksmith is optimistic that advancements in AI agents will address these limitations. Sage Future plans to continuously test new models and explore more complex scenarios, including multi-agent teams and diverse objectives. “Possibly in the future, we’ll try things like giving the agents different goals, multiple teams of agents with different goals, a secret saboteur agent — lots of interesting things to experiment with,” he explained. The Promise of AI for Good This experiment offers a tantalizing glimpse into the potential of AI agents to contribute to charity and nonprofit fundraising . While still in its nascent stages, the technology demonstrates a capacity for resourcefulness, collaboration, and goal-oriented action. As AI agents become more sophisticated, they could revolutionize how nonprofits operate, potentially automating fundraising tasks, enhancing outreach, and even personalizing donor engagement. The challenges encountered also provide valuable learning opportunities, highlighting areas for improvement in AI agent design and robustness. As Binksmith notes, safety and oversight will be crucial as these technologies evolve. However, the initial success of Sage Future’s experiment fuels hope that AI agents can indeed be a powerful force for good, helping charities like Helen Keller International achieve their missions and create a more compassionate world.

Brace yourselves, because top crypto executives are making a bold prediction: global banks are poised to dive headfirst into Bitcoin by late 2025. This isn’t just wishful thinking; it’s a forecast based on increasing regulatory clarity and growing institutional interest in the digital gold. Let’s delve into what this could mean for the future of finance and the cryptocurrency landscape. Why Are Global Banks Eyeing Bitcoin Now? The prediction, made by Messari CEO Eric Turner and Sygnum Bank co-founder Thomas Eichenberger at Paris Blockchain Week, points towards a significant turning point. But what’s fueling this anticipated surge in adoption of Bitcoin by traditional financial giants? Regulatory Tailwinds: For years, regulatory uncertainty has been a major hurdle for institutional involvement in crypto. However, the tide is turning. Regulators worldwide, including those in the often-complex U.S. landscape, are actively working towards establishing clearer frameworks for cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. This growing clarity provides the necessary legal certainty for risk-averse institutions like global banks to enter the space. Institutional Demand is Building: Despite the notorious volatility of the crypto market, there’s an undeniable undercurrent of institutional interest. Large players are recognizing Bitcoin’s potential as a store of value and a diversifying asset. As institutional adoption becomes more mainstream, banks are feeling the pressure to offer crypto services to meet client demand and stay competitive. Preparation Behind the Scenes: Eichenberger specifically highlighted that international banks with U.S. operations are already gearing up. They are actively preparing to offer services like crypto custody and trading as soon as the legal landscape becomes more defined. This proactive approach signals a serious commitment and suggests that the infrastructure for bank involvement is being built right now. Navigating the Crypto Regulation Landscape: What’s Changing? The mention of crypto regulation is key to understanding this shift. For too long, the lack of clear rules has kept major financial institutions on the sidelines. But the regulatory environment is evolving, albeit at varying paces across the globe. Region Regulatory Approach Impact on Institutional Adoption United States Moving towards clearer frameworks for crypto and stablecoins. Various agencies (SEC, CFTC, OCC) are actively involved in defining rules. Positive. Increased clarity is expected to encourage greater institutional participation, including bank involvement. Europe (MiCA) Comprehensive Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation is being implemented, providing a unified framework across EU member states. Highly positive. MiCA offers a clear legal basis for crypto operations, fostering confidence for institutions. Asia (e.g., Singapore, Hong Kong) Proactive and relatively progressive regulatory environments in certain jurisdictions, aiming to attract crypto innovation while managing risks. Positive. These regions are becoming hubs for crypto activity, potentially influencing global bank strategies. Other Regions Varying approaches, from outright bans to cautious observation. Global harmonization remains a challenge. Mixed. Regulatory fragmentation can create complexities but also opportunities in more favorable jurisdictions. This regulatory momentum, as Turner points out, isn’t solely dependent on U.S. political winds. It’s a broader, global trend, suggesting a more sustainable and widespread acceptance of cryptocurrencies within the established financial system. Institutional Adoption: Beyond the Hype, What are the Real Benefits? The concept of institutional adoption of Bitcoin and crypto has been a recurring theme in the industry. But what are the tangible benefits that banks and other institutions stand to gain by embracing this digital asset class? Diversification and Enhanced Returns: Bitcoin’s low correlation with traditional assets like stocks and bonds makes it an attractive diversification tool. Incorporating Bitcoin into portfolios can potentially enhance risk-adjusted returns, especially in times of economic uncertainty. Meeting Client Demand: As crypto awareness and adoption grow among retail and institutional investors, banks need to offer crypto services to remain relevant and cater to evolving client preferences. Ignoring this demand could lead to clients seeking services elsewhere. New Revenue Streams: Offering crypto custody, trading, and other related services can create new revenue streams for banks. Transaction fees, custody fees, and potential future crypto-based financial products can contribute to profitability. Innovation and Future-Proofing: Engaging with crypto and blockchain technology positions banks at the forefront of financial innovation. It allows them to experiment, learn, and adapt to the evolving digital landscape, ensuring they remain competitive in the long run. Crypto Custody: A Key Service for Banks Entering the Space For global banks to offer Bitcoin services, secure and reliable crypto custody solutions are paramount. Custody refers to the secure storage and management of digital assets on behalf of clients. This is a critical function, especially for institutional investors who require robust security and regulatory compliance. Key aspects of crypto custody for banks include: Security: Implementing advanced security measures, including cold storage, multi-signature wallets, and robust cybersecurity protocols, to protect digital assets from theft and hacking. Regulatory Compliance: Adhering to evolving regulatory requirements related to crypto custody, including KYC/AML (Know Your Customer/Anti-Money Laundering) compliance and reporting obligations. Insurance: Obtaining insurance coverage to protect against potential losses of custodied assets due to unforeseen events. Scalability and Efficiency: Developing custody solutions that can handle large volumes of transactions and assets efficiently, while maintaining security and compliance. As banks ramp up their crypto offerings, expect to see significant advancements and competition in the crypto custody space, driving innovation and improving security standards. Actionable Insights: Preparing for the Bank-Bitcoin Era So, what does this predicted influx of global banks into Bitcoin mean for you? For Investors: Increased institutional involvement is generally seen as a positive sign for the long-term health and stability of the Bitcoin market. It could lead to increased liquidity and potentially drive price appreciation over time. For the Crypto Industry: Bank adoption validates the legitimacy of cryptocurrencies and could pave the way for wider mainstream acceptance. It also presents opportunities for collaboration and partnerships between traditional finance and the crypto sector. For Banks: The move into crypto is not without its challenges. Banks need to navigate regulatory complexities, build robust infrastructure, and manage risks effectively. However, the potential rewards – new revenue streams, client acquisition, and future-proofing – are significant. Conclusion: A Transformative Shift on the Horizon The prediction of global banks entering Bitcoin by late 2025 is more than just speculation. It reflects a confluence of factors – growing regulatory clarity, increasing institutional demand, and proactive preparations within the banking sector. While market volatility is inherent in the crypto space, the underlying trend points towards a transformative shift. The integration of Bitcoin into the traditional financial system, spearheaded by institutional adoption and facilitated by robust crypto custody solutions, could reshape the future of finance as we know it. Keep a close watch on the regulatory landscape and the actions of major financial players – the bank-Bitcoin era may be closer than you think.

Back in 2017 , it famously turned heads with a 20x surge , and in early 2025 , history nearly repeated itself as XRP climbed from under $0.15 to a peak above $2.70 . But as of April 8, XRP is showing signs of cooling off , currently trading around $1.95 . After dipping to as low as $1.60 , XRP bounced slightly, but analysts note the trend may be weakening as it struggles to hold above key resistance at the $2.00 mark. RSI Signals Potential Consolidation Ahead According to the latest chart data, XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dropped below 45 , indicating slowing momentum. Volume surged last week during the steep drop, a sign that profit-taking may have kicked in. Without a new catalyst, XRP could enter a period of sideways movement or even mild decline . For those who rode XRP’s rally from $0.15 to $2.70, the returns were impressive. But for new investors entering now, the upside may be more limited—at least in the short term. MAGACOIN FINANCE -New Rising Star – Raises $5.5 Million — And Investors Are Rushing In While XRP appears to be pausing, another project is picking up serious traction: MAGACOIN FINANCE . This emerging crypto project has already raised over $5.5 million dollars in its ongoing presale, and interest is climbing fast. With a limited supply, growing community excitement, and a clear roadmap, early supporters believe MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver 30x returns by Q2 2025 . Investor demand continues to grow as more traders seek opportunities with higher upside than mature large-cap coins like XRP. Unlike tokens that may have already peaked, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers something new — and still early. Analyst Perspective: Time to Rotate? “XRP gave investors 20x in 2017 and again in 2025. That type of repeat performance is rare,” says one market analyst. “Now the attention is turning to lower-cap projects that are just beginning their climb. That’s where the potential 20x or 30x moves really happen.” As MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to hit major fundraising milestones, it’s quickly becoming a favorite among early-stage investors looking to catch the next wave before Q2.

In a new interview on the Presidio Bitcoin YouTube channel, Dorsey is asked to imagine that he fast-forwarded to the future where Bitcoin has failed. When asked how Bitcoin failed, Dorsey says the flagship crypto asset faded into irrelevance because it was only used as a store of value and not as a form of money for payments and transactions. “I think it fails through irrelevance. It fails to be relevant to people on a daily basis. If it just ends up being a store of value and nothing more, I don’t think it gains relevance at all. I think it has to be payments for it to be relevant on the everyday. Otherwise, it’s just something you kind of buy and forget and only use in emergency situations or when you want to get liquid again. So I think if it doesn’t transition to payments and find that everyday use case, it’s increasingly irrelevant. And that’s fair to me.” When asked what can be done to mitigate the risk of Bitcoin failing, Dorsey says more applications need to be built to facilitate easy, fast payments to rival giants like Visa and Mastercard. “I think building simple accessible experiences that solve the payment use case, making it scale, making it fast, giving the speed of the Visa and Mastercard networks real competition – and there are tons of projects that do that – and it continues to increase in privacy and security and ultimately safety. That gives you a third option, and I think we always want a third option to the US dollar, to the Chinese yuan. Having a third option for currency is important and it keeps the other currencies in check and governments in check as well.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Fears of a prolonged trade war and mounting macroeconomic tensions have triggered a wave of panic selling across risk assets, with Solana among the hardest hit. The altcoin has plunged over 60% from recent all-time highs, reflecting the brutal conditions gripping even the strongest large-cap tokens. Related Reading: Solana Drops Below $100 For First Time In A Year — Is An 80% Correction Underway? Despite the carnage, there are early signs that a short-term rebound could be on the horizon. Prominent analyst Bluntz shared his outlook on X, noting that he has started bidding on several oversold altcoins like Solana, showing bullish divergence. According to Bluntz, many of these tokens have fallen in a straight line, setting the stage for what he believes could be “sizeable bounces” in the near term. While he doesn’t believe this is the definitive market bottom, the presence of bullish divergence across multiple charts offers a glimmer of hope for traders seeking relief rallies. With Solana hovering at critical support levels, all eyes are on whether this bounce thesis plays out — or if further downside awaits. Solana At A Critical Juncture As $100 Level Faces Pressure Solana is now at a crucial technical and psychological crossroads as the $100 level remains a key price to hold. After a brutal selloff that intensified over the weekend, Solana dropped more than 20% in just a few hours, reflecting the panic and uncertainty dominating crypto markets. The breakdown below $120 signaled a major shift in sentiment, and the breach of $100 has left bulls scrambling to defend one of the last major supports before lower demand zones come into play. Bulls initially lost control as price action turned sharply bearish last week, triggered by broader macroeconomic instability. US President Donald Trump’s new wave of tariffs has intensified trade war fears, adding pressure to an already fragile global market. Risk assets like Solana have been hit especially hard, with many altcoins suffering from sharp drawdowns amid growing investor fear. Still, there’s a potential glimmer of hope. Bluntz contrarian view on X notes that he has begun bidding on several altcoins — including SOL and HYPE — that have dropped over 60% in near-vertical moves. He highlighted bullish divergences forming across multiple charts, which often precede relief bounces. “I definitely don’t subscribe to the idea this is ‘THE BOTTOM,’” he added, “but sizeable bounces are highly likely in my opinion.” Related Reading: Ethereum Capitulation May Be Nearing End – Will A Fed Pivot Spark A Recovery? While the long-term trend remains under pressure, signs of oversold conditions and hidden strength could offer traders short-term opportunities. For Solana, the ability to reclaim and hold the $100 level could spark a recovery bounce. Otherwise, deeper losses may follow. Price Action Details: Key Liquidity Levels Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $108 after several volatile days attempting to hold above the critical $100 support level. This price range has become a major battleground for bulls and bears, as sentiment across the broader crypto market remains fragile. Macroeconomic instability, rising trade tensions, and ongoing selling pressure have pushed risk assets into uncertain territory — and Solana is no exception. Bulls are now faced with a crucial challenge. To shift the momentum and signal the beginning of a recovery phase, SOL must not only defend the $100 mark but also reclaim the $120 level, which previously acted as support before turning into resistance. A breakout above this zone could open the door for further gains and a potential short-term trend reversal. Related Reading: Ethereum Lags Behind Bitcoin In Q1 Performance Amid Market Downturn – Details However, failure to hold the $100 level would likely lead to a deeper retracement. Analysts warn that a decisive breakdown below this support could send SOL plunging into the $80 range, where the next significant demand zone sits. With price action hanging in the balance, the coming days will be critical for Solana’s trajectory — either triggering a recovery bounce or accelerating the current downtrend.

One of its prominent players, Treasure DAO , the platform behind the MAGIC token, has just announced a series of drastic measures to stay afloat. This isn’t just another project tweaking its roadmap; it’s a critical pivot involving significant cuts and a complete exit from game distribution. For anyone invested in crypto, particularly in the gaming sector, this news signals a potentially seismic shift and raises urgent questions about the sustainability of current models. Treasure DAO’s Desperate Measures: Cutting Deep to Survive Treasure DAO , known for its ecosystem built around the MAGIC token and its interoperable metaverse, has revealed a concerning financial situation. The numbers paint a clear picture of unsustainability. According to reports, their quarterly spending reached a staggering $11.3 million in the last quarter of 2023. Juxtapose that with a meager $40,000 in revenue during the same period, and you have a gaping financial chasm. This massive disparity has left Treasure DAO with a rapidly dwindling runway, estimated to last only until July. The implications are serious, forcing the project to take drastic action to ensure its continued existence. Metric Q4 2023 Figure Quarterly Spending $11.3 Million Quarterly Revenue $40,000 To address this alarming situation, Treasure DAO has implemented a series of tough decisions: Layoffs: The project has already carried out layoffs, reducing its workforce to cut operational costs. This is always a difficult step, reflecting the severity of the financial pressure. Exiting Game Distribution: Perhaps the most significant strategic shift is Treasure DAO’s departure from the game distribution market. This indicates a refocusing of resources on core strengths and a retreat from less profitable ventures. The Broader Context: Challenges in Blockchain Gaming Treasure DAO’s predicament isn’t happening in a vacuum. It highlights the broader challenges facing the entire blockchain gaming sector. While the promise of play-to-earn and decentralized gaming experiences is enticing, the reality of building sustainable and profitable platforms is proving complex. Several factors contribute to these difficulties: User Acquisition and Retention: Attracting and retaining players in blockchain games is expensive. The traditional gaming market is fiercely competitive, and blockchain games need to offer compelling gameplay and incentives to draw users away from established titles. Tokenomics and Economic Sustainability: Designing robust tokenomics that balance player rewards, platform revenue, and token value is a delicate act. Many early play-to-earn models have struggled with inflation and unsustainable reward mechanisms. Development Costs and Timeframes: Developing high-quality games, even blockchain-based ones, requires significant investment and time. The crypto market’s volatile nature adds further pressure, as projects need to generate revenue quickly to survive market downturns. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based projects remains unclear in many jurisdictions, adding another layer of complexity and risk. Decoding the DAO Crisis: What Went Wrong for Treasure DAO? The situation at Treasure DAO raises questions about the operational and financial management within Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) in general. While DAOs offer a vision of decentralized governance and community ownership, they also present unique challenges. The concept of a DAO crisis , while perhaps dramatic, is relevant in this context. Some potential contributing factors to Treasure DAO’s financial woes could include: Overspending: The $11.3 million quarterly spending figure suggests potentially unsustainable operational costs. It’s crucial for DAOs to maintain fiscal discipline and carefully manage their treasuries. Revenue Generation Challenges: The stark contrast between spending and revenue highlights a failure to generate sufficient income. This could stem from various issues, including an ineffective business model, slow user adoption, or market conditions. Market Downturn: The broader crypto market downturn in 2022 and 2023 undoubtedly impacted many projects, including Treasure DAO. Bear markets can significantly reduce token values and user activity, straining even well-funded projects. Strategic Missteps: Exiting game distribution suggests that this particular venture may not have been successful or profitable for Treasure DAO. Strategic decisions, especially in a rapidly evolving space, are critical for long-term success. Impact on MAGIC Token Holders: Navigating Uncertainty For holders of the MAGIC token , the news of Treasure DAO’s financial difficulties and strategic shifts introduces significant uncertainty. Token prices often react sharply to such announcements, and MAGIC is likely to be no exception. Investors need to carefully consider the following: Token Value Volatility: Expect increased volatility in the price of MAGIC. Negative news can lead to sell-offs, while any signs of successful restructuring or recovery could trigger price rebounds. Project Viability: The long-term viability of Treasure DAO and the MAGIC ecosystem is now under scrutiny. The success of their cost-cutting measures and strategic pivot will determine the project’s future. Community Sentiment: Monitor community sentiment and engagement. A strong and supportive community can be a crucial asset in navigating challenging times. Alternative Investments: Investors should re-evaluate their portfolio allocation and consider diversifying their holdings to mitigate risks associated with individual projects facing financial difficulties. Path to Survival: Can Treasure DAO Turn the Tide? The question now is: can Treasure DAO successfully navigate this crisis and turn the tide? Their strategy hinges on: Effective Cost Reduction: The implemented cuts need to be deep enough to significantly reduce spending without crippling essential operations and development. Focusing on Core Strengths: Exiting game distribution suggests a renewed focus on core areas. Identifying and doubling down on their most successful and profitable offerings is crucial. Community Support and Engagement: Rallying community support and fostering active engagement will be vital for morale and future growth. Exploring New Revenue Streams: Beyond cost-cutting, Treasure DAO needs to explore and implement new revenue generation strategies to ensure long-term financial sustainability. The situation with Treasure DAO serves as a potent reminder of the challenges and risks inherent in the crypto space, particularly in the rapidly evolving field of blockchain gaming. While the promise of decentralization and innovative gaming experiences remains, projects must demonstrate financial prudence, strategic agility, and a strong focus on building sustainable business models. The coming months will be critical for Treasure DAO as they attempt to execute their survival plan and navigate this turbulent period. The entire crypto gaming community will be watching closely to see if they can emerge stronger on the other side.

Travis Hill (FDIC chair) went through these reforms in his speech to express how the agency deals with financial innovation and stability. FDIC pushes to bring back community banks The number of bank charters in the U.S. dropped from over 8,500 in 2008 to about 4,500 today, and Hill explains that the leading cause is that several banks merged while fewer than six banks a year are formed. The FDIC plans to support the creation of new banks in underserved areas by lessening capital requirements for applicants looking to register with simple, traditional banks. Hill went on to mention in his speech that about 68 million Americans reside in counties without local community banks. The FDIC also wants to reconsider how it reviews deposit insurance applications from tech-based and non-traditional banks because it’s better to regulate these groups than let them operate via complicated partnerships. FDIC eases crypto rules to support innovation The new FDIC guidelines allow banks to start crypto-related services without requesting permission beforehand, but on condition that they manage the risks properly and communicate with their regulators. Hill said that the FDIC now views crypto like any other bank we’re moving activity, but it blocks public blockchain use even though other countries permit it. The FDIC reconsidered how it handles a situation when a bank collapses after the Bank of Silicon Valley and Signature failed in 2023. Experts like Former FDIC Chair Sheila Bair support the cause and say sales will better protect communities and recover value. There was also criticism from the likes of Shayna Olesuik, who said the FDIC is wrong to lessen the regulations surrounding it without following the proper rulemaking process. Hill responded to critics by saying that the FDIC will ensure these banks meet high service standards while changing its rules to be more efficient and realistic for new entities. FDIC evaluates stablecoin regulation and technical safeguards for bank resolution Hill also touched on new issues related to stablecoins, especially in the context of Congress’ ongoing lawmaking efforts. The FDIC is reviewing whether to amend regulations governing pass-through deposit insurance to clarify eligibility criteria for stablecoin reserve deposits. Some areas for review include liquidity risk management, protection against illicit finance, and cybersecurity standards. In 2020 and 2021, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) granted multiple crypto-related services to national banks, including stablecoin custody and issuance, participation in blockchain validation, and acceptance of stablecoin-related deposits. Now, the FDIC is weighing whether to clarify where permissible activities end and where they may begin or broaden its touch on regulatory guidance to add more use cases. The speech also highlighted the need for more explicit regulatory coverage of tokenized real-world assets and liabilities, such as tokenized commercial bank deposits. Hill stressed that the FDIC sees “deposits as deposits, no matter the technology or recordkeeping used. But he raised questions about counterparties’ ability to withdraw at par in the case of a bank failure through smart contracts, noting that could raise resolution costs if safeguards on such outflows are not protective. This concern is energizing internal FDIC efforts to consider technical solutions that could prevent unintended money moves when banks are resolved. According to Hill, the challenge is to reconcile on-chain programmability with the traditional safeguards built into financial regulation that are intended to promote an orderly resolution of institutional failures.

43099150,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=147574,1744157441,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Warning: Ethereum Price Could Plunge to $990 – Shocking Crypto Market Analysis,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ethereum-price-plunge-market-analysis/,"Is the Ethereum party coming to an abrupt end? Recent analysis is sending shivers down the spines of ETH investors, suggesting a potential Ethereum price drop to as low as $990. If you’re holding ETH, you’re probably wondering what’s going on and if you should be worried. Let’s dive into the details and understand this concerning ETH price prediction . Is History Repeating Itself for Ethereum Price? According to a recent Cointelegraph analysis, the current price action of Ethereum is eerily similar to patterns observed in 2018 and 2022. Remember those times? We saw significant rallies followed by brutal corrections that ushered in prolonged bear markets. The analysis points to a specific technical indicator – a bearish divergence – as a key warning sign. Let’s break down what this means: Bearish Divergence Explained: Imagine the price of Ethereum making higher highs, seemingly bullish, right? But simultaneously, the Relative Strength Index (RSI), a momentum indicator, is making lower highs. This is a bearish divergence. It suggests that while the price is still going up, the upward momentum is weakening, and a potential reversal could be on the horizon. Think of it as the market running out of steam. Historical Parallels: In both 2018 and 2022, Ethereum exhibited this bearish divergence pattern. What followed? Significant price corrections and extended bear markets. The analysis suggests we might be witnessing a similar setup now. Support Line Breakdown: Just like in the previous instances, Ethereum has broken away from a major support line. This is another red flag, indicating weakening buyer interest and increasing selling pressure. Why $990? Understanding the ETH Price Prediction Target So, where does the $990 figure come from? The analysis projects a potential downside target range of $990-$1,240. This range isn’t pulled out of thin air. It’s based on the historical price action and the expectation that the current cycle might follow a similar trajectory to past bear markets. A key indicator for identifying market bottoms is the RSI. Historically, Ethereum bear market bottoms have often coincided with the weekly RSI entering the oversold zone, which is below 30. Currently, the ETH/USD weekly RSI is still above 30. This is crucial because it implies that, according to this analysis, there’s still room for further decline before Ethereum potentially finds a bottom. Is a Cryptocurrency Crash Imminent? While the analysis focuses specifically on Ethereum, it’s important to consider the broader crypto market analysis . Ethereum is a bellwether for the altcoin market, and its price movements often influence the entire cryptocurrency space. A significant drop in Ethereum price could trigger a wider market correction or even a cryptocurrency crash , impacting Bitcoin and other altcoins as well. What Should Ethereum Investors Do? Actionable Insights This analysis isn’t meant to induce panic, but rather to provide a data-driven perspective on potential risks. So, what are the actionable takeaways for Ethereum investors? Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on the Ethereum price charts and monitor key technical indicators like the RSI. Track reputable crypto news sources for market updates and analysis. Risk Management is Key: If you are heavily invested in Ethereum, consider your risk tolerance. Are you comfortable riding out a potential further decline? Now might be a good time to review your portfolio and ensure your risk management strategy is in place. This could involve setting stop-loss orders or diversifying your holdings. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): For long-term believers in Ethereum, a potential price drop could present a buying opportunity. Dollar-cost averaging – investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals – can be a strategy to mitigate risk and capitalize on lower prices over time. Don’t Panic Sell: While the analysis points to a potential downside, it’s crucial to avoid emotional decision-making. Panic selling during market downturns can often lead to losses. Make informed decisions based on your own research and risk assessment, not solely on fear. Challenges and Counterarguments It’s important to acknowledge that technical analysis is not foolproof. Market predictions are based on probabilities, not certainties. Here are some challenges and counterarguments to consider: Market Sentiment Shift: Positive news or developments in the Ethereum ecosystem, such as successful upgrades or increased institutional adoption, could shift market sentiment and invalidate the bearish scenario. Black Swan Events: Unforeseen global events, both positive and negative, can dramatically impact the cryptocurrency market, making technical analysis less reliable in the short term. Analysis Limitations: Technical analysis is just one tool in the box. It’s crucial to consider fundamental analysis, on-chain metrics, and the broader macroeconomic environment for a holistic view. Conclusion: Navigating the Uncertain Ethereum Price Landscape The analysis suggesting a potential Ethereum price drop to $990 serves as a warning sign for investors. While history doesn’t always repeat itself perfectly, the similarities to past bear market patterns are undeniable. Whether or not Ethereum will indeed fall to $990 remains to be seen. However, this analysis underscores the importance of vigilance, risk management, and informed decision-making in the volatile cryptocurrency market. Stay informed, stay prepared, and navigate the market with caution.

Just as blockchain technology revolutionized digital transactions, a new company, Deep Cogito, is stepping into the limelight with a novel approach to AI. They’re not just building another AI model; they’re introducing a family of Hybrid AI Models called Cogito 1, designed to switch between ‘reasoning’ and standard modes, promising a leap in efficiency and capability. For those in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space constantly seeking cutting-edge tech, Deep Cogito’s unveiling is something to watch closely. Unveiling Deep Cogito and Their Innovative Hybrid AI Models Deep Cogito has officially stepped out of stealth mode, bringing with it a fresh perspective on AI model architecture. Their core innovation lies in Hybrid AI Models , which intelligently blend reasoning and non-reasoning components. Think of it like this: Reasoning AI, exemplified by models like OpenAI’s o1, excels at complex tasks such as mathematics and physics because they methodically work through problems, essentially fact-checking their steps. This process, known as AI reasoning , ensures accuracy in intricate scenarios but demands significant computational resources and time. On the other hand, standard AI models are quicker for simpler tasks but may lack the in-depth analysis needed for complex queries. Deep Cogito’s hybrid approach aims to give you the best of both worlds. Here’s a breakdown of the hybrid model concept: Efficiency Boost: Hybrid models are designed to answer straightforward questions rapidly, leveraging non-reasoning elements for speed. Intelligent Resource Allocation: For more challenging questions, the ‘reasoning’ component kicks in, dedicating extra processing time for in-depth analysis. Versatility: This dual capability makes Hybrid AI Models incredibly versatile, suitable for a wide range of applications from quick queries to complex problem-solving. Cogito 1: Outperforming Open AI Models and Setting New Benchmarks Deep Cogito’s initial offering, the Cogito 1 family of models, is entirely based on this hybrid architecture. The company boldly claims that Cogito 1 outperforms leading Open AI Models of comparable size, including those from tech giants like Meta and the rising Chinese AI startup DeepSeek. In a recent blog post, Deep Cogito stated, “Each model can answer directly or self-reflect before answering (like reasoning models),” highlighting the adaptable nature of their models. What’s even more impressive? This entire model family was developed by a small team in just about 75 days, showcasing remarkable efficiency and expertise. The Cogito 1 range is diverse, spanning from 3 billion to 70 billion parameters, with even larger models up to 671 billion parameters slated for release soon. Parameters are a rough indicator of an AI model’s problem-solving prowess – generally, more parameters equate to enhanced capabilities. Key highlights of Cogito 1’s performance: Feature Description Hybrid Architecture Combines reasoning and non-reasoning components for efficiency and depth. Performance Claims to outperform similar-sized Open AI Models from Meta and DeepSeek. Scalability Models range from 3B to 70B parameters, with up to 671B parameters coming soon. Availability Accessible for download or via APIs on Fireworks AI and Together AI. Built on Open Source Foundations: Llama and Qwen Transparency and collaboration are vital in the tech world, and Deep Cogito acknowledges its foundations. Cogito 1 isn’t built from the ground up; instead, Deep Cogito leveraged Meta’s open Llama and Alibaba’s Qwen models as their base. By applying innovative training methodologies, they enhanced the performance of these base models and enabled the crucial toggleable reasoning feature. This approach not only accelerates development but also contributes to the growing ecosystem of Open AI Models . Benchmarking Success: Cogito 70B vs. Industry Leaders Deep Cogito hasn’t just made claims; they’ve backed them up with internal benchmarking. The results are compelling: Cogito 70B, the largest in the Cogito 1 family, surpasses DeepSeek’s R1 reasoning model in several mathematics and language evaluations when reasoning is enabled. Even with reasoning disabled, Cogito 70B outperforms Meta’s Llama 4 Scout model on LiveBench, a widely recognized general-purpose AI benchmark. These results underscore the power and potential of Deep Cogito’s AI Reasoning and hybrid architecture. Accessibility is also a priority for Deep Cogito. Every Cogito 1 model is readily available for download or use via APIs on prominent cloud providers Fireworks AI and Together AI, making these advanced Hybrid AI Models accessible to developers and researchers alike. The Team Behind the Innovation: DeepMind and Google Veterans Behind every successful tech startup is a capable team, and Deep Cogito is no exception. Founded in San Francisco in June 2024, the company is led by co-founders Drishan Arora and Dhruv Malhotra. Malhotra brings experience as a former product manager at Google’s DeepMind, where he focused on generative search technology.

As of today, April 9, 2025, the market appears to be continuing its downward trend, as the tariff war between the United States and other countries shows no sign of ending soon. XLM Price Action and Its Key Levels Amid the bearish market sentiment, the XLM price prediction has become a key topic of discussion. According to expert technical analysis, the asset has been moving within a falling wedge pattern on the daily time frame. With the recent price drop, XLM has failed to hold its key support level of $0.23 and is now heading toward the lower boundary of the pattern. Source: Trading View Historically, this support level has acted as a zone for price reversals or rebounds. However, after failing to hold this level, XLM could decline by 16% and reach the next support level at $0.19 in the coming days. XLM Price Prediction This continuous price decline has raised concerns about whether it will come to an end or if the asset might see a reversal with upside momentum. The daily chart indicates a strong possibility that the asset could reach the $0.19 level. However, this could be the point where XLM experiences a price reversal. If the downside momentum continues, though, the asset’s price could decline by another 25%, potentially reaching the $0.14 level. Current Price Momentum At press time, XLM is trading near $0.22 and has recorded a price decline of over 6% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume dropped by 50%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day. $2.37 Million Worth of Bearish Bet In addition to the bearish price action, traders also appear to be following the overall market sentiment, as many are strongly betting on the downside. Data from the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass reveals that traders are currently over-leveraged at the $0.212 level on the lower side, with $1.80 million worth of long positions. On the other hand, the $0.234 level is another over-leveraged zone on the upper side, with $2.37 million worth of short positions opened by traders. Source: Coinglass This metric clearly reflects traders’ bearish view of XLM, which could push the asset lower in the coming days.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XLM,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-09 00:26:17

The newly launched Leveraged Teucrium XRP ETF (XXRP) has made a powerful entrance into the market, racking up an impressive $5 million in trading volume on its very first day. In a market often described as cautiously optimistic, this debut signals significant investor interest in XRP and the burgeoning world of cryptocurrency ETFs. Let’s dive into what makes this launch so noteworthy and what it could mean for the future of crypto investments. Why is the Teucrium XRP ETF Launch a Big Deal? Teucrium, an independent ETF issuer, has once again broken ground in the digital asset space with the introduction of the 2x Long Daily XRP ETF (XXRP). This isn’t just another ETF; it’s a leveraged ETF , designed to amplify the daily returns of XRP. But what exactly does ‘leveraged’ mean, and why is the trading volume on day one so significant? Leveraged Exposure: A leveraged ETF uses financial derivatives and debt to magnify the returns of an underlying index or asset. In the case of XXRP, it aims to deliver 2x the daily percentage change of XRP. This means if XRP goes up by 1%, the ETF aims to go up by 2%, and vice versa. First Day Volume: According to Bloomberg ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas, the $5 million trading volume on the first day is not just good; it’s exceptional. Balchunas highlighted on X (formerly Twitter) that this places XXRP in the top 5% of all new ETF launches, a remarkable feat in any market condition, let alone the current one. Outperforming Competitors: To put this volume into perspective, Balchunas pointed out that XXRP’s volume is roughly four times greater than that of the 2x Solana ETF (SOLT). This comparison underscores the strong initial interest specifically in an XRP-focused leveraged product. Breaking Down the ETF Trading Volume Numbers To truly grasp the significance of $5 million in first-day ETF trading volume , let’s consider a few key points: Market Sentiment Indicator: High trading volume on launch day often indicates strong initial market interest and conviction. For XXRP, it suggests that investors are keen to gain leveraged exposure to XRP, viewing it as an asset with potential for significant price movements. Liquidity and Efficiency: Robust trading volume ensures liquidity, making it easier for investors to buy and sell shares without significantly impacting the ETF’s price. This is crucial for the smooth functioning of the ETF and for attracting both institutional and retail investors. Comparison to Other Launches: As Balchunas noted, being in the top 5% of new ETF launches is a significant achievement. Most ETFs struggle to gain traction in their early days, often launching with much lower volumes. XXRP’s strong start suggests a robust underlying demand for this type of product. Why a Leveraged Cryptocurrency ETF? The introduction of a Leveraged ETF for XRP raises an important question: why leveraged exposure in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies? Here’s a breakdown of the potential reasons and benefits: Benefit Description Magnified Returns Leveraged ETFs are designed for investors who believe in short-term, directional movements in the price of the underlying asset. If XRP performs as expected, the leveraged ETF can offer significantly higher returns compared to holding XRP directly. Capital Efficiency Investors can gain twice the exposure to XRP with the same amount of invested capital compared to a non-leveraged ETF or direct XRP holding. Sophisticated Trading Tool For experienced traders, leveraged ETFs can be valuable tools for implementing sophisticated trading strategies, such as hedging or tactical allocation, especially in a fast-moving market like cryptocurrency. However, it’s crucial to remember that leverage works both ways. Just as potential gains are magnified, so are potential losses. Leveraged ETFs are inherently riskier and are generally designed for short-term trading rather than long-term investment. Investors should fully understand the risks involved before considering investing in XXRP or any leveraged product. Teucrium: Pioneers in Cryptocurrency ETFs Teucrium has established itself as a forward-thinking issuer in the ETF space, particularly within the realm of digital assets. They were among the first to launch futures-based Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in the US, and now they are venturing into leveraged Cryptocurrency ETFs . This proactive approach highlights their belief in the growth and maturation of the cryptocurrency market. Teucrium’s move to launch an XRP leveraged ETF can be seen as a strategic expansion of their crypto ETF offerings, catering to the growing demand for diverse and sophisticated crypto investment products. Their willingness to innovate and introduce products like XXRP is a positive sign for the broader adoption and accessibility of digital assets through traditional financial instruments. What Does This Mean for the Future of XRP and Crypto ETFs? The successful launch of the Teucrium XRP ETF with such strong initial volume could have several implications: Increased Institutional Interest: High trading volume might attract further attention from institutional investors who are looking for regulated and accessible ways to gain exposure to XRP and the crypto market. Product Innovation: The success of XXRP could pave the way for more specialized and leveraged cryptocurrency ETFs, offering investors a wider range of tools to participate in the crypto market. Validation for XRP: Strong demand for an XRP-focused ETF can be seen as a form of market validation for XRP, despite its past regulatory challenges. It suggests that investors see long-term value and potential in XRP. Actionable Insights for Investors Considering the debut of the Teucrium XRP ETF, here are some actionable insights for investors: Due Diligence is Key: Understand the mechanics of leveraged ETFs. They are not buy-and-hold investments and require active monitoring and management. Ensure you are fully aware of the risks involved. Consider Your Risk Tolerance: Leveraged ETFs are high-risk, high-reward instruments. Assess your risk tolerance and investment goals before allocating capital to XXRP. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market developments and XRP-specific news. The cryptocurrency market is dynamic, and staying informed is crucial for making sound investment decisions. Diversification: As with any investment, diversification is important. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, especially with volatile assets like cryptocurrencies and leveraged products. Conclusion: A Promising Start for XRP and Leveraged Crypto ETFs The $5 million first-day trading volume for the Leveraged Teucrium XRP ETF (XXRP) is undeniably an impressive achievement. It signals strong initial investor interest and underscores the growing appetite for diverse cryptocurrency investment products. While leveraged ETFs are not for everyone and come with inherent risks, the successful launch of XXRP marks a significant step forward for both XRP and the evolution of cryptocurrency ETFs . It will be fascinating to watch how this product performs in the coming months and whether it truly opens the door for a new wave of innovative crypto ETFs.

43100033,https://blockworks.co/news/stablecoin-infrastructure-platform-solana,1744158843,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/blockworks.png,Stablecoin infrastructure platform M^0 expands to Solana,https://blockworks.co/news/stablecoin-infrastructure-platform-solana,"This is a segment from the Lightspeed newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . M^0, an EVM protocol for stablecoin coordination, has expanded to Solana, the team told Lightspeed exclusively. M^0’s (pronounced Em-Zero) first Solana user will be Kast, a platform offering banking-like services with stablecoins. The move comes as various and sundry actors bring new stablecoins to market, and M^0 hopes to unify the increasingly fragmented sector. At a basic level, M^0 offers a stablecoin “building block” called $M — a kind of vanilla stable backed by US T-bills. Clients who want to launch their stablecoin effectively wrap $M and can customize things like yield or custody. $M’s first user was the Cosmos ecosystem app Noble, which made use of the infrastructure when launching the yield-bearing USDN stablecoin . It also paired with RWA stablecoin outfit Usual to launch UsualM. M^0’s latest partner in Kast plans to offer two Solana stablecoins: a payments and a savings one. The tokens, the names of which have not been finalized, will eventually be able to be swapped for other $M stablecoins on Solana and bridged to other ecosystems via Wormhole. To my mind, the M^0 model sounds a bit like white label stablecoins — a concept Kast has also made use of through its Solana validator partnership with Kiln. And white label stablecoins make a lot of sense, given how everyone from the Wyoming state government to President Trump-backed World Liberty Financial wants to have a stablecoin. In an interview, M^0 chief strategy officer Joao Reginatto said “a couple of other companies” will be leveraging $M to build stablecoins on Solana. But despite all the buzz, the stablecoin landscape remains pretty duopolistic. 76% of all stablecoins on Solana are Circle’s USDC, and another 18% are Tether’s USDT, according to DeFiLlama. M^0’s clients will hope to unseat Circle — and Solana might hope one of them can do so. Among Solana’s chief competitors is Base, which is operated by Coinbase, the latter of which has a revenue sharing agreement with Circle. “Solana perhaps doesn’t see with very good eyes the widespread use of USDC on Solana” given how some of USDC’s revenue filters back down to Coinbase, Reginatto said.

As SHIB continues to show signs of stagnation at around $0.000012, savvy crypto traders are increasingly drawn to Mutuum’s explosive potential. Phase 4 of the presale has already launched giving investors optimism. Over $6.3 million has been accumulated and 8000 holders attracted. New investors purchase MUTM at its current price of $0.025 because the value will reach $0.03 as part of Phase 5. Current investors have the opportunity to achieve a 140% return on investment before the project launch occurs at $0.06. MUTM could hit $5 after launch, 82x return. Mutuum Finance Presale Surges as Investor Interest Grows Mutuum Finance leads the decentralized lending market through its innovative dual-lending system and it has established itself as a quick-growing collaborative system. The project maintains increasing popularity as 8000 investors put $6.3 million into the presale. During Phase 4 which presents the current trading value of $0.025 investors can expect a 20% price increase in Phase 5 to secure substantial profit potential. Research data indicates that MUTM stands among the most underpriced yet promising DeFi projects set to exceed $5 after its release on the market. Mutuum Finance stands apart for its ability to unite the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models in one system. The P2C model combines USDT liquidity pools that produce passive income for users who benefit from automatic smart contracts used for lending operations. Both P2P and P2C models deliver fundamental DeFi functions to users through their different mechanisms for transacting directly between parties without third-party involvement. Through the blending of these two models, Mutuum Finance enhances security, efficiency, and decentralization, making it a good fit for DeFi investors seeking high-yielding alternatives. The Development of a Stable Secure Environment To demonstrate its focus on stability Mutuum Finance releases a fully secured Ethereum-based stablecoin backed by USD. The stablecoin token stands distinct from algorithmic stablecoins because Mutuum Finance bases it on over-collateralization to provide both risk reduction and long-term trustworthiness. Open financial architectures paired with audited smart contracts alongside this architecture strengthen investor trust by covering all the vulnerabilities found in past DeFi projects. Mutuum Finance implements incentive plans as a method to increase its community reach. By offering a $100,000 giveaway the program will give out 10 thousand dollars worth of MUTM tokens to winners among 10 participants in addition to its innovative referral system that pays users for successful new investor acquisitions. Early adopters of Mutuum Finance obtain both special staking pools and governance rights and VIP access to platform updates which keeps them committed to the platform over the long term. Sustainable Tokenomics for Long-Term Growth Mutuum Finance implements controlled token supply restrictions and deflationary mechanics throughout presales to build scarcity in its framework thus boosting the token’s potential value growth. The staking program gives crypto users attractive incentives to remain engaged while ensuring token sustainability during long-term development of the platform. As early Shiba Inu (SHIB) investors look for the next big opportunity, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a promising contender. After SHIB’s recent stagnation, many traders are turning to MUTM due to its explosive potential. With over $6.3 million raised in Phase 4 of the presale and 8000 investors already on board, MUTM is currently priced at $0.025, set to increase to $0.03 in Phase 5. Those who enter now can see a 140% ROI before the project officially launches at $0.06. Analysts predict that MUTM could surge to $5 post-launch, offering an incredible 82x return. Join the presale today and secure your spot in the future of DeFi with Mutuum Finance (MUTM).

Those with unique tech, reward options, or strong user communities are showing better performance in presale stages. In a shifting market, coins with strong planning, clear goals, and transparent systems stand out. This article lists the top meme coin presales by looking at their current progress, use cases, and plans for the future. Whether it’s meme-themed games, AI tools, or utility-focused wallet tokens, each project brings a different kind of value. If you’re searching for coins with actual purpose and early traction, this review will help narrow your picks. Let’s begin with Dragoin—a fantasy-style game project blending fun gameplay with useful mechanics. Dragoin: Utility Meme Coin with Huge ROI Potential Dragoin ($DDGN) merges fantasy gameplay with Telegram-based earning through a battle system involving dragons. This isn’t a typical meme coin. The presale follows a 25-stage format inspired by dragon stories, giving each buyer a different experience. The first sale round began at $0.0000292 per coin, with launch pricing expected at $0.002. This setup may provide high gains for early buyers. Half of all coins are available in the presale, and any that remain unsold are removed to manage supply. Since the game runs inside Telegram, it’s easy to access. It doesn’t stop at just gaming. Dragoin is planning an entire ecosystem. Around 30% of its 200 billion coins are set aside for ongoing development, while team coins remain locked for two years. For user safety, its smart contract has been renounced to avoid central control. The play-to-earn model is set to go live by Q3 2025, followed by listings on exchanges. With its themed game design, easy access, supply burn setup, and role for $DDGN within the project, Dragoin ranks high among top meme coin presales, especially for people who want more than just meme-based ideas. BTC Bull Token: Earning Rewards as Bitcoin Rises BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) is directly connected to Bitcoin’s price journey. It shares BTC as rewards when certain price points are reached, such as $150K or $200K. So far, it has raised over $4.3 million in presale, showing strong early interest. A staking system is available with returns up to 97% APY, which adds more appeal beyond just holding. The token follows Bitcoin’s supply model, with a hard cap of 21 billion coins. As BTC hits set values, tokens are burned, increasing scarcity. Its full setup includes staking rewards, Bitcoin giveaways, and deflation mechanisms that support user engagement. With clear plans and a system that uses BTC growth as a reward trigger, BTCBULL stands out among top meme coin presales for those who expect Bitcoin to keep climbing. MIND of Pepe: Combining AI Use with Meme Culture MIND of Pepe ($MIND) blends meme themes with artificial intelligence. It operates with an AI system that scans platforms, interacts with apps, and gives holders access to insights and project launches. The idea here is to use AI to find potential, then rewarding users with benefits. The presale has already passed $7.8 million, and each unit is priced at $0.0031384. There’s a staking option too, with possible returns up to 288% APY. A total of 100 billion tokens are set, with sections assigned for AI, rewards, and presale use. The code has been checked by Coinsult for safety. The group involved also helps shape project plans. While some Reddit discussions have raised concerns about similar past projects, the tech-forward model still puts MIND of Pepe on the list of top meme coin presales for users looking for function behind the meme design. Best Wallet Token: Utility Within a Crypto App Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is designed for real function inside a working app. This non-custodial wallet supports more than 60 blockchain systems, and its token provides lower fees, reward options, and early project access. As of April 2025, the presale has passed $11 million, with early coin pricing starting at $0.0225 and rising to $0.0242 across its 100 presale stages. Holding $BEST gives lower costs on app actions like trades and swaps. There’s also staking with changing APYs, and safety is supported by a Coinsult audit. Its total coin plan includes 30% for project growth and staking rewards, along with user giveaways. Analysts suggest a future price of $0.4995, and Best Wallet aims to gain 40% of the wallet space. These reasons make $BEST one of the top meme coin presales this year. What Makes These Coins Worth Tracking? Each project brings its own strengths—from engaging games to AI tools and real app use. The key difference is that these coins aren’t just talk; they have clear ideas and detailed setups for growth. Dragoin uses storytelling and supply limits for impact. BTCBULL links directly to Bitcoin’s progress to reward its users. MIND of Pepe builds with AI for early insights, and Best Wallet Token already supports a working product. For those deciding where to focus attention next, these are the top meme coin presales with strong early growth signals. With major funding, committed user bases, and focused plans, each option on this list has the parts needed for a strong 2025 launch. Whether you’re into games, useful tools, or reward-focused systems, these choices offer plenty to consider before prices climb.

CMT-Certified Analyst Says $38,000-$42,000 Is Coming",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-eyes-38000-42000/,"The Bitcoin (BTC) price crash to $74,000 has left traders speculating whether the cryptocurrency has finally hit a bottom. However, a CMT-certified analyst suggests that Bitcoin’s price correction is far from over. He has predicted an even deeper pullback to $38,000 – $42,000, which he identifies as Bitcoin’s final price bottom. In a detailed Elliott Wave-based chart analysis, CMT-certified technical analyst Tony Severino outlines a classic 5-wave impulsive structure that appears to have completed its final leg near $85,000. Severino’s analysis highlights that Bitcoin’s latest decline to $74,000 is merely the start of a broader ABC corrective pattern, potentially driving the cryptocurrency down to a bottom in the range of $38,000 – $42,000. New Bitcoin Price Bottom Incoming In Bitcoin’s 5-wave impulse structure, Wave 1 began with a sharp bear market low, followed by Wave 2, a corrective pullback. Wave 3 marked the strongest upward move, subdivided into five smaller waves (i to v). After the market paused briefly for a pullback in Wave 4, Wave 5 kicked off with a final push toward a peak near $85,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin RSI Targets Daily Retest That Triggered 2024 Price Rally, What Happened Last Time Following the top of Wave 5, Bitcoin’s ABC corrective structure began, marked by the red line on the chart. According to the analyst, the cryptocurrency is currently completing Wave A of this corrective pattern, which is expected to bottom out near $62,000 – $65,000 by June 2025. This price range coincides with the previous main correction zone around Wave 4, which is a common target for Wave A retracements. Notably, a bigger concern comes after Bitcoin’s possible crash to $65,000 – $62,000. The analyst anticipates a short-lived bounce in Wave B, followed by a more pronounced decline in Wave C. This downturn is expected to push the Bitcoin price to its final bottom target between $38,000 and $42,000 by April 2026. This pullback target further aligns with the iv sub-wave of Wave 3, which often serves as a key retracement zone during market corrections. Severino has confirmed through his technical analysis that the market is now in a bear phase. His price chart incorporates cyclical timing models, marking a complete market cycle characterized by a bull market peak in 2025, followed by a bear market extending into mid-2026. This timeline is consistent with Bitcoin’s typical four-year halving cycle, where the market reaches its peak the year after the halving event before entering a bear market phase. Analyst Flags Death Cross In BTC’s Chart According to reports from BarChart on X, Bitcoin has just formed a Death Cross on its price chart for the first time since September 2024. A Death Cross occurs when the 50 Moving Average (MA) crosses below the 200 MA. Related Reading: Bitcoin Marks 114 Weeks In Active Buy Signal On The SuperTrend Weekly, But Things Could Turn Bad If This Happens This distinct chart pattern is often considered a bearish sign, indicating that a potential downtrend might be on the horizon. Considering Bitcoin’s price has declined to $78,900 at press time, the appearance of a Death Cross indicates a possibility of further breakdown and consolidation.

The upgrade equips developers, users, and institutions with better tools to maintain the privacy of their token transactions in compliance with legal and regulatory obligations. Solana advances privacy on public blockchains with Confidential Balances feature The new launch is a pivotal moment for Solana , which has been quickly iterating on its technology as demand for privacy in DeFi has ramped up. Simultaneously, the network aims to maintain a cooperative stance with regulators and large institutions. With the innovative use of state-of-the-art encryption alongside careful design, Solana is expanding the definition of privacy on a public blockchain. This Confidential Balances feature builds upon the previous feature known as Confidential Transfers . Originally introduced as part of Solana’s Token2022 program, the feature enabled users to send and receive tokens where the amount sent out wasn’t public. Solana has now augmented these features, allowing transaction amounts of minted or burned tokens and transaction fee payouts to be masked. Sensitive information will be hidden from token movements. That’s a big deal. Most of the more familiar traditional blockchain systems —like Bitcoin and Ethereum — store the details of every transaction and make them available to anyone. This degree of transparency is great for some use cases, but it is expensive or compromising for businesses and users who appreciate confidentiality. Solana’s method keeps sensitive financial information obscured but locked on the chain. The public ledger is secure but does not reveal private data. Developers are already experimenting with these tools in Solana’s Rust programming environment. This allows Wallet-as-a-Service providers to handle encryption and proof generation on the backend. While mainstream wallets lack native support for Confidential Balances , this will likely change soon as JavaScript-based tools roll out. Auditor keys provide institutions with controlled access to confidential transactions While Solana focuses on privacy, it also ensures compliance. This is why confidential balances are also shipped with auditor keys. These special tools enable approved organizations or people — such as financial institutions, regulators, or tax agencies — to see transaction details without making them public. Auditor keys can then be shared with trusted parties if the project that utilizes Solana chooses to use them. This allows requirements for financial audits, anti-money laundering checks, or tax reporting to be met without exposing sensitive data to the public in general. What matters is that this information is not made public. The upper bound of harmonics used to compute the reconstruction will be queried by the sampling repository when needed. The authorized party that owns the auditors’ key can only see the data. Others see a private transaction. This enables the firms in Solana’s ecosystem to comply with financial regulations, such as anti-money laundering (AML), counter-terrorist financing (CTF), or tax reporting, without sacrificing users’ privacy. This flexible system means projects can choose their level of transparency. For example, while a DeFi protocol could remain private, regulated fintech companies could apply auditor keys for periodic reporting. This binary— user privacy and institutional transparency — is part of what makes Solana’s new model so exciting. JavaScript upgrades will add privacy to mobile wallets Until now, all but one of the Confidential Balances features have been built using Solana’s toolchain based on Rust. That’s fine for backend systems and developers but excludes the ordinary user who uses mobile apps and browser wallets. That’s about to change. Solana’s developer ecosystem is gearing up to release zero-knowledge-proof-backed JavaScript-based libraries. Without heavy server infrastructure, these libraries enable mobile and web wallets to create and verify proof locally on the user’s device. This is an important step. Solana will make private transactions simple and user-friendly by enabling cryptographic functions to execute on users’ phones or laptops. You won’t have to be a coder or tech whiz to safeguard your financial information. As these tools go live, even more wallets and applications implement Confidential Balances. Wallets might also provide user-selectable public/private transaction settings and allow users to generate proofs for records or compliance. This may be the turning point in making advanced privacy functionalities a day-to-day phenomenon for blockchain. Users with advanced privacy support will not have to build their specific structure to protect their belongings and activity, as they would have to do today.

To offload this surplus, they’ll likely need to lower prices to attract buyers in other regions,” he added. Falling mining rig prices could see non-US mining operations scale up and take a larger slice of Bitcoin’s total hashrate, Mellerud said. Source: Jaran Mellerud US President Donald Trump unveiled his administration's “reciprocal tariffs” on nearly every country on April 2. Some of the largest crypto mining machine makers are based in countries hardest hit by the tariffs, including Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia, which saw tariffs of 36%, 32% and 24%, respectively. Crypto mining rig makers Bitmain, MicroBT and Canaan moved to some of these countries to circumvent a 25% tariff that Trump imposed on China in 2018 during his last administration. Annual change in US tariffs on China, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand since 2017. Source: Hashlabs Mining Mellerud noted that Trump’s latest tariffs would mean a mining rig that initially costs $1,000 would be priced at $1,240 in the US. “Meanwhile, in Finland and most other countries, there are no tariffs, so the cost of a $1,000 machine remains unchanged.” “In an industry as cost-sensitive as Bitcoin mining, a 22% price increase on machines can make operations financially unsustainable,” he added. No coming back from Trump’s tariffs — ‘Damage is done’ Mellerud believes a future reversal of the Trump administration’s tariffs wouldn’t restore US crypto mining operators’ confidence. “Even if these tariffs are rolled back within a few months, the damage is done — confidence in long-term planning has been shaken,” Mellerud said. “Few will feel comfortable making major investments when critical variables can change overnight.” He said US miners felt reassured when Trump returned to the White House, expecting a more stable regulatory environment. Related: Bitcoin hashrate tops 1 Zetahash in historic first, trackers show “But they are now experiencing the flip side of his unpredictable policy shifts,” Mellerud said. The US accounts for nearly 40% of the network’s hashrate. Mellerud said there’s no reason for US miners to unplug their machines and doesn’t expect the total Bitcoin hashrate coming from the US to drop. However, the path to expansion is now “steep and uncertain,” he said, and as a result, the US could lose a considerable share of hashrate . Trump’s tariffs have shaken up almost every market, including the crypto markets and Bitcoin ( BTC ), which is down 4% over the last 24 hours to $76,470, CoinGecko data shows.

The Canadian Department of Finance announced the countermeasures earlier this week, and they target non-Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) compliant vehicles imported from the US with a 25% tariff. “These countermeasures will remain in place until the U.S. eliminates its tariffs against the Canadian auto sector,” it said in a statement. Canada announces countermeasures against auto imports from the United States On March 4, 2025, the US implemented a series of tariffs on Canada: 25% tariff on Canadian goods and a 10% tariff on energy and potash exports. These tariffs were later adjusted to apply only to non-CUSMA-compliant products. On March 12, a further 25% was imposed on Canadian steel and aluminum products . In a move further escalating trade tensions, a 25% tariff on Canadian automobiles was enacted on April 3, directly impacting the auto industry and the over 500,000 Canadians it employs nationwide. The Canadian Minister of Finance, the Honorable François-Philippe Champagne said that Canada’s countermeasures to the unjustified tariffs imposed by the US on the Canadian auto industry would be enforced at 12:01 a.m. EDT on April 9, 2025. The Canadian Minister of International Trade and Intergovernmental Affairs, the Honorable Dominic LeBlanc, said “Canada is being needlessly and unfairly targeted by these tariffs, and the US’s decision leaves us with no choice but to respond to protect Canadian interests, workers and businesses.” The countermeasures include: 25% tariffs on non-CUSMA-compliant fully assembled vehicles imported into Canada from the United States, and 25% tariffs on non-Canadian and non-Mexican content of CUSMA-compliant fully assembled vehicles imported into Canada from the United States. This means if a vehicle is compliant with CUSMA, the parts which are not from Canada or Mexico will be taxed. The current scope of tariffs is on goods worth over $30 billion. However, the Canadian government says it will increase its scope to about $155 billion worth of imported goods if the US tariffs remain. “Canada continues to respond forcefully to all unwarranted and unreasonable tariffs imposed by the U.S. on Canadian products. The government is firmly committed to getting these U.S. tariffs removed as soon as possible, and will protect Canada’s workers, businesses, economy and industry,” Minister Champagne said. China and EU response to Trump tariffs On April 4, 2025, China announced that it would impose a 34% tariff on all US imports starting from April 10. In response, Trump asked China to remove the tariff or be hit with another 50% tariff, bringing the total to about 104%. The Chinese embassy in the US said China will not back down. “The U.S. tariff escalation threat against China compounds its mistake and further exposes its nature of blackmail, which China will never accept,” the embassy posted on X, adding that “China will fight till the end if the U.S. side is bent on going down the wrong path.” On March 12, 2025, the EU, in retaliation against US tariffs on steel and aluminum reinstated previously turned-off tariffs against bourbon and motorcycles from the American side, with effect from April 1. In addition, another €18 billion worth of U.S. goods is subject to additional tariffs proposed for implementation by mid-April. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Here’s the Math,https://coingape.com/markets/can-dogecoin-price-hit-100-with-a-100b-supply-heres-the-math/,"Dogecoin price plunged below the $0.14 mark on Tuesday, April 8, posting 20% losses on the weekly timeframe. Bull traders continue to express optimism that the next rebound phase could drive DOGE to new all time highs. With fresh catalysts like Trump’s crypto strategic reserve and inflows expected from altcoin ETFs under SEC-review, is $100 a realistic price target for Dogecoin? Can Dogecoin Price Reach $100? Amid the global market crash, Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to attract significant interest. Notably, as the largest memecoin by market capitalization, DOGE has a large global While community remains one of the most active in crypto. As crypto markets tumbled to new weekly lows at $0.14, bull continue to weigh prospects of a parabolic Dogecoin price rally to all time highs above $100. A realistic look at Dogecoin’s circulating supply and basic market math raises significant doubts about the $100 DOGE price forecast. Dogecoin market data | Source: Coingecko According to Coingecko data , Dogecoin has a circulating supply of over 148 billion tokens.At $100, Dogecoin would command a $10 trillion market cap. Even if the total supply were capped at 100 billion, reaching $100 per token would require a $10 trillion market capitalization. US Stocks by market cap (Apple, NVIDIA, Microsoft), April 9 2025 | Source: CompaniesByMarketcap That’s nearly five times the current market cap of Apple, the world’s most valuable company, and more than APPL, NVIDIA and Microsoft stocks combined By comparison, Bitcoin’s total supply is 21 million coins, and it has yet to sustainably break above a $1.5 trillion valuation. A $10 trillion valuation for DOGE would also exceed the global M2 money supply of many major economies, making the price target mathematically improbable under current economic conditions. Dogecoin price analysis: Technical signals cap upside at $0.25 near term As of April 8, Dogecoin is trading near $0.19, down roughly 10% from its monthly high of $0.21. However, the technical Dogecoin price forecast charts suggests Dogecoin may face difficulty breaking above the $0.25 resistance in the short term. Unless a major catalyst—such as X DOGE integration or another Elon Musk tweet—emerges, upside potential appears capped within this range, while the $100 prediction remains a distance target. Dogecoin is currently consolidating near $0.14, significantly below its early April high of $0.21, with a clear lack of bullish conviction. The chart illustrates a textbook falling wedge pattern—typically bullish—but Dogecoin has yet to confirm a breakout, casting doubt on the rally potential without external catalysts. Dogecoin price forecast | DOGUSD The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 32.57, signaling oversold conditions, but critically remains below the neutral 50 mark. This suggests weak momentum despite the technical setup for a reversal. A true bullish breakout would require RSI to reclaim 50 alongside volume expansion, which currently sits at a muted 6.11 million. Volume spikes, such as the one seen in early February, previously failed to sustain bullish momentum. The recent 20.87% drop over four days reflects a bearish retest of support rather than a breakout retest, further confirming market hesitation. The VWAP is now slightly above price at $0.1396, indicating that DOGE is trading under average weighted value—an additional bearish cue. A confirmed wedge breakout could target $0.4247, but until DOGE closes above $0.25 with volume confirmation, the bearish bias dominates. In this Dogecoin price forecast, traders should brace for extended consolidation or deeper pullback without news-driven volatility to drive upside momentum. Long-term price case hinges on utility, not hype Dogecoin’s historical surges have mostly been sentiment-driven. However, sustained growth at institutional levels requires real-world use cases. Currently, DOGE is accepted by a few merchants and tipping platforms, but lacks the smart contract functionality of Ethereum or the enterprise appeal of XRP. That said, the coin’s fast transaction speed and low fees could support a case for micro-payments or retail adoption in emerging economies. Still, utility at scale must be proven before even a $1 price target becomes tenable. Community support remains Dogecoin’s strongest asset While fundamentals and market cap calculations limit extreme targets, Dogecoin remains one of the few cryptocurrencies with consistent global support. The community has funded projects like lunar missions and charity initiatives, giving it a unique cultural relevance. Elon Musk’s influence has also periodically pumped its price, though those moves tend to be short-lived. For DOGE price to enter meaningful gains in the near-term, the broader financial market must recover from the turbulence surrounding the US trade war.

Dragoin Stage 1 Ignites As WIF Drops & BNB Rises Fast,https://thecoinrise.com/is-this-the-100x-meme-coin-youll-regret-missing-dragoin-stage-1-ignites-as-wif-drops-bnb-rises-fast/,"The meme coin crowd is buzzing—but not for the usual names. Dogwifhat (WIF) just hit a wall, with the Las Vegas Sphere promo getting axed and nearly $700,000 in refunds heading back to contributors. That’s triggered a major correction, with WIF tanking over 20% this week. Meanwhile, Binance Coin (BNB) is riding high on ETF rumors, pushing bullish predictions toward the $750–$1,400 range. So where’s the real upside in all this? The answer is quietly exploding: Dragoin ($DDGN) . While others fumble hype campaigns, Dragoin is locking in real progress. With a live Stage 1 presale at $0.0000292, rising prices in every stage, and a 6,700% upside, Dragoin is turning heads as one of the best new cryptos to buy this year. Early movers are already jumping in before the presale slips into the next tier. Dragoin Brings Real Utility to the Table — One of the Best New Cryptos to Buy This Year While other meme coins lean into social buzz, Dragoin is creating an actual ecosystem—one that goes far beyond memes. The platform plans to launch a Telegram-based play-to-earn game in Q2 2025, allowing users to hatch, train, and battle dragons for token rewards, all without leaving the app. It also features upcoming staking, token governance, and both centralized and decentralized exchange listings by Q3 2025. But what really sets Dragoin apart is its strategic, scarcity-focused presale model. Split across 25 fantasy-themed stages, starting with “The Fall of Valyria” and ending at “The Final Battle for the Iron Throne,” each round offers a fixed price before moving to the next. The presale opened at just $0.0000292, with a launch price set at $0.002—representing up to 6,700% upside for early buyers. That’s not just speculation—it’s structured opportunity. 50% of the entire 200 billion token supply—100 billion DDGN—is reserved for the presale, with the remainder supporting liquidity, partnerships, and a development fund that’s locked for two full years. Importantly, any unsold tokens from each stage are automatically and permanently burned, tightening supply and protecting long-term value. This eliminates dilution risks and rewards early participation in real time. Dragoin also isn’t leaving mobile users behind—over 800,000 X1 Miner users are already active, and further integrations with gaming and staking are expected to roll out throughout the year. With a fully transparent roadmap and growing community engagement, Dragoin is shaping up to be more than just a meme—it’s a movement. And with Stage 1 selling fast, now is the window to enter before the next price jump locks out early positioning. Dogwifhat News: Refunds, Price Dips, and What’s Next The canceled Las Vegas Sphere campaign marked a sharp pivot in Dogwifhat’s narrative. Once a viral meme coin success story, WIF is now in refund mode—returning nearly $700K in unused promotional donations. That uncertainty has spilled into the charts, with WIF slipping to around $0.36 after a week of heavy corrections. Some traders still see rebound potential, with price forecasts ranging between $0.26 and $1.50 in the short term. But the hype wave has clearly crested. For meme coin holders looking for the next breakout backed by more than just internet energy, Dragoin’s scarcity model and gaming roadmap are standing out. BNB Price Outlook: ETF Hype Fuels Bullish Push While meme coins ride highs and lows, Binance Coin (BNB) is surging ahead on solid fundamentals. Now hovering just below $600, BNB is benefiting from strong ETF speculation, with forecasts aiming at $755 in the coming weeks—and some even projecting $1,454 by May if ETF approval hits. BNB’s advantage lies in its established role as a utility token for the Binance exchange. That backbone gives it a level of institutional credibility that many meme coins simply can’t match. But for early-stage value hunters, Dragoin’s high-upside, low-entry setup is turning heads as a meme coin that’s positioned to scale. The Bottom Line The meme market’s momentum is shifting fast. Dogwifhat is scrambling to recover from a failed promo push. BNB is riding ETF speculation to new highs. But Dragoin is doing something that stands out: executing a real plan, delivering gamified utility, and burning supply in real time. With its Stage 1 presale live at $0.0000292, a roadmap that includes governance, staking, and a P2E Telegram game, and a clear value model tied to scarcity, Dragoin is grabbing the attention of serious buyers. And with 6,700% upside potential on the table, it’s not just another coin—it’s potentially the next 100x opportunity the market’s been waiting for.

Bitcoin Whale Transaction Count Has Just Seen A Large Spike As pointed out by analyst Ali Martinez in a new post on X, whales notably upped their activity during the recent price surge. The indicator of relevance here is the “Whale Transaction Count” from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, which measures the total number of transfers occurring on the Bitcoin blockchain that are carrying a value of more than $1 million. Only the whale entities are capable of moving amounts this large with single transactions, so the Whale Transaction Count is assumed to correspond to the activity of these humongous investors. Related Reading: Ethereum MVRV Drops To Lowest Since December 2022: Bottom Signal? When the value of the metric rises, it means the whales are making more moves on the network. Such a trend could be a sign that the interest around the asset is going up among this key cohort. On the other hand, the indicator witnessing a decline suggests the large traders may be shifting attention away from the cryptocurrency as they are making fewer transactions. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the Whale Transaction Count for Bitcoin during the last few weeks: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin Whale Transaction Count slumped to a low level during the weekend, but following BTC’s price crash to kick off this new week, its value saw revitalization. At the peak of this spike on Monday, the whale transfers reached the 1,715 mark, a significant value. From the chart, it’s apparent that the surge in whale activity has so far led into a recovery push for the cryptocurrency’s price. Thus, it’s possible that these large entities made their moves to capitalize on the price dip and helped fuel the rally. Related Reading: Here’s Where Ethereum’s Last Line Of Defense Lies, According To On-Chain Data That said, the indicator has cooled off a bit today, a potential sign that the whales may already be done with their accumulation. So, it only remains to be seen whether the recovery will last. Something that could prove to be a bearish omen is the fact that ancient Bitcoin has just been involved in a transaction. As the chart shared by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn in an X post displays, 365 BTC dormant since 10 or more years has been moved on the network. The amount itself isn’t too large in the grand scheme of things, but generally, ancient entities breaking their silence doesn’t tend to be a positive sign for Bitcoin, as it implies market conditions have forced even the diamond hands into selling. BTC Price Bitcoin saw recovery toward $81,000 yesterday, but the coin has since seen a minor retrace back to $79,700.

The economist vented his frustrations in a New York Times guest essay published Monday, where he challenged the administration for citing his academic work in the calculations behind their tariff policies — contending that they “got it wrong.” Neiman’s study, co-authored with three other economists, examined the economic impact of tariffs, specifically regarding U.S. trade deficits and the effect of putting duties on imports. Neiman’s work implied that tariffs would need to be much lower than those the Trump administration ultimately imposed. However, in the “Reciprocal Tariff Calculations” report, the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) cited his paper to defend much steeper tariff rates. Neiman wrote in his op-ed that the administration’s citations of his findings contained fundamental flaws. He voiced disbelief that the USTR, led by a Trump administration trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, used his research to justify “dramatically higher” tariff rates than were warranted by his work. Neiman said the tariffs were approximately four times higher than the data indicated. Neiman said the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative had published its methodology and quoted an academic paper written by four economists, including him, as seeming to endorse its figures. But he also said the USTR had “got it wrong” and “very wrong.” Specifically, Neiman noted that the USTR used a 25% “pass-through” rate, a key figure that describes how much of the tariff burden gets passed through from the importer to the consumer, rather than the 95% pass-through rate that his research calculated. If the government had been working from the more accurate number from Neiman’s study, the resulting tariffs would have been much lower, Neiman said. Economists are critiquing the reciprocal tariff strategy Neiman’s criticism went beyond the flawed application of his research to the general strategy behind the tariffs. The Trump administration’s policy was based on “reciprocal tariffs” to reduce trade deficits with some countries. The policy was part of Trump’s broader strategy to “level the playing field” in trade and to take particular aim at countries including China, Mexico, and the European Union. Neiman argued that pursuing zero trade deficits by raising tariffs is a misguided end. He said that Trade disparities are usually the product of many economic variables, including but not limited to differences in natural resources, comparative advantage, and stages of economic development. He made the case that Americans are spending more on clothes made in Sri Lanka than Sri Lankans are spending on American goods and that this isn’t an indication of unfair competition but rather the result of different economic structures, he said. Imbalances in trade between two nations can occur for any number of reasons unrelated to protectionism, Neiman wrote, adding that the administration was oversimplifying the problem. Neiman also noted another major problem: The formula used to compute the new tariffs is broken. The formula was based on the assumption that tariffs on one country would not change imports from other countries and would not affect exports. Neiman said this assumption is unrealistic regarding broad, sweeping tariffs that apply to multiple countries, as they do. Neiman explained that a big tariff on Japanese auto parts could push up demand for auto parts from Mexico instead as manufacturers search for cheaper alternatives, and vice versa. He also said the tariffs would likely invite retaliation and, over time, could push up the dollar’s value, hurting U.S. exports. Policymakers twisting academic research to fit their agenda is proving to be a costly and controversial move Neiman’s work, originally meant to guide policymakers on the best way to impose tariffs, has become controversial. He has even expressed frustration at watching his research be misinterpreted and used to justify policies he opposes. In his op-ed, Neiman disagreed fundamentally with the government’s trade and trade policy approach. Even taken at face value, he added, their findings indicated that the calculated tariffs should be much smaller — perhaps one-fourth as large. The dust-up over Neiman’s research reflects the persistent debates in America over trade policy. The global economic landscape is evolving, and the U.S. relationship with its trade partners remains a hot topic in politics. The policy-making process involving the no-good use of academic research poses valid questions of transparency and accountability. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

One of the malicious listings, called “officepackage,” has real Microsoft Office add-ins but hides a malware called ClipBanker that replaces a copied crypto wallet address on a computer's clipboard with the attacker's address, Kaspersky’s Anti-Malware Research Team said in an April 8 report. “Users of crypto wallets typically copy addresses instead of typing them. If the device is infected with ClipBanker, the victim’s money will end up somewhere entirely unexpected,” the team said. The fake project’s page on SourceForge mimics a legitimate developer tool page, showing the office add-ins and download buttons and can also appear in search results. Kaspersky said it found a crypto-stealing malware on the software hosting website SourceForge. Source: Kaspersky Kaspersky said another feature of the malware’s infection chain involves sending infected device information such as IP addresses, country and usernames to the hackers through Telegram . The malware can also scan the infected system for signs it’s already been installed previously or for antivirus software and delete itself. Attackers could sell system access to others Kaspersky says some of the files in the bogus download are small, which raises “red flags, as office applications are never that small, even when compressed.” Other files are padded out with junk to convince users they are looking at a genuine software installer. The firm said attackers secure access to an infected system “through multiple methods, including unconventional ones.” “While the attack primarily targets cryptocurrency by deploying a miner and ClipBanker, the attackers could sell system access to more dangerous actors.” The interface is in Russian, which Kaspersky speculates could mean it targets Russian-speaking users. “Our telemetry indicates that 90% of potential victims are in Russia, where 4,604 users encountered the scheme between early January and late March,” the report stated. To avoid falling victim , Kaspersky recommended only downloading software from trusted sources as pirated programs and alternative download options carry higher risks. Related: Hackers are selling counterfeit phones with crypto-stealing malware “Distributing malware disguised as pirated software is anything but new,” the company said. “As users seek ways to download applications outside official sources, attackers offer their own. They keep looking for new ways to make their websites look legit.” Other firms have also been raising the alarm over new forms of malware targeting crypto users. Threat Fabric said in a March 28 report it found a new family of malware that can launch a fake overlay to trick Android users into providing their crypto seed phrases as it takes over the device.

ETH is now consolidating losses and might face resistance near the $1,520 zone. Ethereum failed to stay above the $1,600 and $1,550 levels. The price is trading below $1,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1,520 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair remains at risk of more losses if it fails to clear the $1,410 resistance zone. Ethereum Price Recovery Fades Ethereum price failed to stay above the $1,620 support zone and extended losses, like Bitcoin . ETH declined heavily below the $1,550 and $1,520 levels. The bears even pushed the price below the $1,450 level. A low was formed at $1,384 and the price recently corrected some losses. There was a move above the $1,410 level. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,617 swing high to the $1,384 low. However, the bears are active near the $1,450 zone. Ethereum price is now trading below $1,500 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $1,475 level. The next key resistance is near the $1,500 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,617 swing high to the $1,384 low. The first major resistance is near the $1,520 level. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1,520 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. A clear move above the $1,520 resistance might send the price toward the $1,560 resistance. An upside break above the $1,560 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $1,620 resistance zone or even $1,650 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $1,520 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,410 level. The first major support sits near the $1,385 zone. A clear move below the $1,385 support might push the price toward the $1,320 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $1,240 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $1,120. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 zone.

The case could pressure the US government to clarify claims about a potential interview with Bitcoin’s creator and reveal insights into the flagship cryptocurrency’s creation. Unveiling Satoshi Nakamoto’s true identity could reshape the narrative around Bitcoin (BTC) and people’s sentiment toward the cryptocurrency. Crypto Lawyer Sues Department Of Homeland Security A prominent crypto lawyer has sued the United States Department of Homeland Security to force it to disclose who it believes is Bitcoin’s enigmatic creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. The lawyer, James Murphy, alleges the agency may know the identity of Bitcoin’s creator and wants to compel it to share what it knows. Murphy filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, basing his accusations on claims made by DHS Special Agent Rana Saoud at a conference in April 2019. Saoud claimed in 2019 that she and a few colleagues had met with four people involved in creating Bitcoin. Murphy announced the lawsuit on X, stating, “The Great Mystery of the 21st Century--Who is Bitcoin Creator ""Satoshi Nakamoto?"" The United States Government claims to know the answer--but isn't talking. So, today I sued the U.S. Government to find out exactly what it knows. IF the interview really happened as the DHS Agent claimed, there should be documentation of the substance of that meeting.” Claims About Satoshi’s Identity Saoud made a sensational claim at the OffshoreAlert Conference North America in Miami in April 2019, stating that DHS agents met with the four people it believed to have created Bitcoin. According to Saoud, the agents asked why they created Bitcoin and what their endgame was. “The agents flew to California, and they realized that he wasn’t alone in creating this. There were three other people, and they sat down and talked with them to find out how this actually works and what the reason for it was.” Murphy said if the DHS resists disclosure, he would pursue the case to its logical conclusion and solve the mystery. However, Murphy did not rule out the possibility that Saoud and the other DHS agents were mistaken and did not meet with Nakamoto. Previous Attempts To Identify Satoshi Nakamoto Murphy’s lawsuit follows several efforts to unmask Satoshi Nakamoto. In October 2024, an HBO documentary claimed Peter Todd, a Bitcoin cypherpunk, invented Bitcoin. However, Todd and other industry experts refuted the claims. Others, including Nick Szabo, Adam Back, and Hal Finney, have also been theorized to be Satoshi Nakamoto. Szabo and Back have denied claims that they are Satoshi Nakamoto. Hal Finney also denied he was Satoshi Nakamoto before he died in 2013. The Bitcoin community is split about whether Nakamoto’s true identity should be revealed, and whether it would be a positive development for Bitcoin. Some community members worry it could compromise Bitcoin’s decentralized ethos and put Nakamoto at significant risk. However, others want to be sure Bitcoin wasn’t created by the US government.

Bubblemaps said in an April 7 X post that 50 million MELANIA tokens worth around $30 million “was moved from community funds — and is now being quietly sold, with no explanation from the team.” It added the tokens were moved to a single wallet before being “split across multiple addresses.” From there, Bubblemaps said $3 million worth were transferred to exchanges, two new $6 million positions were opened, and $500,000 worth of MELANIA was sold. Source: Bubblemaps “No one from the MELANIA team has addressed this. Not the movements. Not the selling,” it added. Bubblemaps said that 92% of MELANIA’s supply is held by “team wallets” and claimed that “the damage isn’t done yet.” MELANIA freefalls from peak high The MELANIA token was launched on Jan. 19, a day after Donald Trump launched his own memecoin and a day before he was due to re-enter the White House. The token has essentially lost all its value since launch and is down over 96% from its January high of over $13, and is trading at $0.51 — down over 7.5% in the last day, according to CoinGecko. Bubblemaps said last month that it found that Hayden Davis, who said he helped create MELANIA, had started “covertly selling $MELANIA tokens via single-sided liquidity.” Related: Libra, Melania creator’s ‘Wolf of Wall Street’ memecoin crashes 99% The firm claimed Davis had also used the tactic to quietly sell LIBRA, a memecoin he also copped to making that was shared by Argentine President Javier Milei, which caused a political scandal after the token’s value cratered. Interest in memecoins has recently waned amid a wider market rout with data from Dune Analytics in March finding that the number of tokens graduating from Solana-based memecoin launchpad, Pump.fun, had dropped by over two-thirds since January, falling from 5400 per week to just 1500. The total number of tokens launching on Solana is also down, with data from SolScan showing only 31,651 launched on April 5, less than one-third of the 95,578 created at the peak of the memecoin frenzy this year on Jan. 26.

Pakistan’s Finance Ministry confirmed the appointment. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif announced the news when Zhao made a business trip to the country. Muhammad Aurangzeb, Finance Minister, says the appointment was a landmark moment for Pakistan. He further states that the event signalled to the world that Pakistan was open to innovation. After meeting with Prime Minister Shehbaz, Zhao’s appointment was made public. “We are sending a clear message to the world: Pakistan is open for innovation,” said Aurangzeb, Pakistan’s Finance Minister. With Zhao onboard, we are accelerating our vision to make Pakistan a regional powerhouse for Web3, digital finance, and blockchain-driven growth. “ Zhao is a high profile leader in the crypto sector, serving as CEO for Binance from 2017 to 2023, ending his tenure with a shock guilty plea to charges related to the U.S. ‘war on crypto’, being accused of not abiding by American anti money laundering laws. Zhao was sentenced to four months in prison. But now, Zhao is upbeat about the future of blockchain in Pakistan. Pakistan is a country”, said Zhao, “of 240 million people, over 60% of whom are under the age of 30. The potential here is limitless”. Zhao met with a large range of high-ranking officials in Pakistan, including the prime minister, deputy prime minister, heads of business, national bank leaders, and finance ministers. Zhao’s visit comes as Pakistan aims to create a legal framework for digital assets, hoping to spur on economic growth. The goal is to regulate cryptocurrencies while leaving enough room for innovation and opportunities for crypto entrepreneurs worldwide. Remittances increased last year, mainly due to a cut down on black market trading. Cross-border trades are most likely on par with trades a year before, that is, before the increased regulations forced traders to use official channels instead of illegal ones. Traders prefer to use stablecoins because they offset the negative effects of a depreciating economy. With a younger population interested in I.T. and Web3 technology, the future seems promising for the country. The Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) was formed to take advantage of the changing demographics and to expand their operations throughout Southeast Asia, creating digital infrastructure projects to promote growth in the region and to attract investors to the country. Bilal Bin Saqib, CEO of the PCC, stated that the key issue was developing a legal framework so that institutions could quickly adopt the technology and scale their operations. Many countries in the region have started to respond to Trump’s crypto policies and have anticipated a change in direct investment due to America’s isolationist positions. In February, Pakistan’s Foreign Direct Investment dropped by 45%, indicating a change in global trade and possibly suggesting an impact from a change in American trade. The PCC further aims to attract foreign investors, perhaps offset the business lag from other sectors. Therefore, the PCC aims to collaborate with the crypto industry and local and global actors to create conditions that work favorably with crypto innovators, such as America finding out that draconian regulations only crush economic innovation rather than protect it. According to the official press release, Zhao will oversee education, infrastructure, regulation, and crypto adoption. It seems that the PCC is adopting crypto to reach out to other surrounding countries as a form of infrastructure to facilitate financial growth in all sectors. One of the benefits of crypto, after all, is its ability to transcend borders. With all of the disruptions to global trade, the PCC may be trying to facilitate trade as much as possible while keeping the black market in check.",Cryptocurrency|News|Binance|Changpeng Zhao|Cryptocurrency News|pakistan,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|SPONSORED|BNB,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-09 03:25:54

In his early days in office, President Trump quickly enacted wide-ranging import tariffs, which targeted specific countries and sectors, using emergency powers. As such, Binance Research’s latest report notes that if inflation remains high while economic growth slows, the Federal Reserve’s actions will be critical in shaping market outcomes. Bitcoin’s Potential to Reassert Independence The new trade tariffs under President Trump’s administration have notably influenced Bitcoin’s correlation profile, offering fresh insights into its behavior during periods of macroeconomic stress. Initially, as trade war rhetoric emerged in January 2025, Bitcoin’s correlation with equities became negative. This was evident as the 30-day correlation dipped to -0.32 by February 20. However, as the rhetoric escalated and risk-off sentiment took hold, Bitcoin’s correlation with equities climbed to 0.47 by March. On the other hand, the crypto’s correlation with gold dropped significantly and turned negative as BTC’s behavior increasingly aligned with broader risk sentiment. This shift depicted the growing influence of macroeconomic factors, such as trade policy and interest rate expectations, on cryptocurrency markets. Despite Bitcoin’s apparent alignment with traditional markets in the short term, Binance’s report highlighted that the crypto retains its distinct identity in the long run. Over the past few years, BTC’s correlation with both equities (~0.32) and gold (~0.12) has fluctuated but has not sustained deep alignment, suggesting its role as an independent asset class. The recent market response to trade policy shocks revealed BTC’s resilience, as it held steady or even rebounded on days when traditional risk assets faltered. Additionally, long-term holders have maintained a steady supply of the crypto asset, which signaled strong conviction in its value even during periods of high volatility. This behavior is seen as indicative of Bitcoin’s potential to reassert itself as a safe-haven asset, particularly during times of economic uncertainty. The research suggests that Bitcoin’s future trajectory depends on its ability to return to its historical pattern of low correlation with equities, as seen during past crises such as the 2023 banking turmoil. Binance’s research highlighted that if BTC can reassert itself as a safe-haven asset, particularly in a global economy marked by protectionism and uncertainty, it could regain its position as a non-sovereign, inflation-resistant asset. This would be especially relevant if global monetary policy shifts, such as potential rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, coincide with elevated inflation, which would potentially position Bitcoin as an attractive store of value. Fed’s Response Key to Bitcoin’s Future Going forward, the broader crypto market faces significant challenges in a stagflationary, protectionist environment. Trade policies, inflation data, and central bank actions are some of the key factors that will influence the future of the crypto market. A protracted trade war could dampen investor sentiment, but any signs of central bank easing or favorable regulatory developments could provide a boost. Binance report expects the crypto markets to remain volatile and range-bound until global conditions stabilize. “Should macro conditions stabilize, new narratives take hold, or crypto reassert its role as a long-term hedge – renewed growth could follow. Until then, markets are likely to remain range-bound and reactive to macro headlines.” The post Bitcoin’s Resilience Tested as Tariffs and Macroeconomic Pressure Drive Market Volatility appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto News|Binance|Bitcoin (BTC) Price|Donald Trump,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|BNB,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-04-09 03:29:42

As of today, the asset is trading at around $1,570, representing a 4.8% increase over the past 24 hours. Ethereum remains under broader market pressure despite the rebound as analysts assess its short-term and long-term positioning. One of the focal points of current market analysis centers around Ethereum’s Realized Price metric. This on-chain indicator recalculates the network’s market value based on the last price each ETH coin moved, providing insight into the average acquisition cost across the blockchain. When ETH trades below this realized price, it often reflects a bearish sentiment and increased selling pressure as holders find themselves underwater. Related Reading: Here’s Where Ethereum’s Last Line Of Defense Lies, According To On-Chain Data ETH Falls Below Realized Price Level According to on-chain analyst and CryptoQuant contributor theKriptolik, Ethereum’s recent dip has taken it below its Realized Price. This development carries important market implications. The analyst noted: Each ETH is evaluated based on the price it was last transferred at. When you average out all those prices, you get the Realized Price. This gives us a much more “realistic” sense of what the average investor paid for their ETH — and it often paints a very different picture from the current market price. Realized Price frequently acts as a psychological support or resistance level. Trading above it typically indicates investor confidence and support; trading below it suggests mounting resistance. The analyst outlined three core takeaways: First, a drop below Realized Price tends to coincide with an increase in loss-driven selling as investors react to being in the red.

Second, such events are often associated with the capitulation phase, where confidence erodes and widespread selling occurs. Lastly, historical data shows that ETH falling below this metric has often aligned with market bottoms and preceded subsequent long-term recoveries. theKriptolik wrote Past data shows that whenever ETH dips below its realized price, it’s often coincided with long-term bottom zones. These periods have consistently been followed by strong recoveries — making them strategic accumulation points for long-term investors. You can see this clearly reflected in the chart below. What This Means for Ethereum Investors While the Realized Price breach signals short-term volatility, it may also represent a potential accumulation zone. Past cycles have seen Ethereum rebound significantly after such movements.

Launched in 2022 under the Biden administration, NCET was a key player in prosecuting cryptocurrency-related offenses, including the DOJ’s historic $4.3 billion settlement case against Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao. However, in an Apr. 7 internal memo sent to DOJ staff and seen by crypto.news, deputy attorney general Todd Blanche declared that the team was being disbanded and that ongoing investigations that didn’t meet new criteria would be closed. The DOJ will now narrow its focus to crypto-related crimes involving terrorism, narcotics trafficking, human trafficking, organized crime, and hacking. The memo explicitly orders prosecutors to stop pursuing cases against crypto exchanges, wallet providers, and mixing services like Tornado Cash based on users’ actions or for regulatory violations made in error. You might also like: Uniswap, Coinbase, and NYSE execs to join SEC roundtable on crypto trading regulations The DOJ will no longer pursue developers for code that’s misused by others, a win for builders in the industry. Blanche criticized the Biden-era approach to crypto as “regulation by prosecution,” calling it reckless. A recent executive order from Trump that upholds the freedom to access open blockchain networks without fear of retaliation is cited in the memo. After aggressively courting the crypto community pre-election, Trump now has personal connections to the sector through World Liberty Financial, a business in which his family reportedly owns a 75% revenue stake. Blanche, a former Trump defense attorney confirmed last month as the DOJ’s second-in-command, also instructed prosecutors not to pursue violations of securities, banking, or commodities laws unless there’s clear evidence of willful misconduct. Not everyone in the cryptocurrency community is happy about the DOJ’s decision. The DOJ’s move away from proactive enforcement, according to critics, may result in a rise in fraud, scams, and criminal activity. This raises the issue of whether a hand-off approach could encourage malicious actors to operate freely.

The deal will open the crypto payment firm to a new range of traditional markets in its quest for seamless cross-border payments. This year, Ripple has partnered with key firms and institutions to drive adoption. Ripple Eyes New Possibilities According to the announcement , the deal, one of the largest in the digital asset space, will boost the expansion of both firms. Ripple’s subsidiaries will tap into new markets as traditional firms increase their appetite for crypto assets. Hidden Road clears about $3 trillion annually for top financial institutions and will leverage XRP’s Ledger for faster and efficient services. XRPL is notable for its fast and scalable infrastructure in the crypto industry. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse noted that this acquisition is huge for the company adding that the right infrastructure is needed to support traditional firms. “… This is the capital and activity that will tap into XRP and the XRP Ledger’s bread-and-butter – instant, efficient, scalable, and low-cost movement of value. Instead of waiting for the company wrote. Furthermore, the company explained the need to merge traditional and decentralized finance highlighting the pathway of Hidden Road’s growth with the backing of Ripple’s balance sheet. Prime brokers like Hidden Road are huge intermediaries for market markets OTC services and other financial institutions. This deal makes Ripple the first crypto company to own a prime brokerage firm. Crypto Community Backs Move Digital asset users expressed delight following the announcement signaling a strong merger between decentralized and traditional finance. Amid the frenzy, crypto executives and analysts highlighted the positive effect of the acquisition on institutional investor inflow. In a nutshell, several traders have tipped institutional funds to fuel the next market uptick. This move adds to Ripple’s growing partnerships to foster cross-border partnerships. In the past months, the company has collaborated with central banks and traditional firms globally. At the time of writing, XRP price jumped 2% in hourly trading as bulls attempted to recover previous losses.

The roundtable will focus on regulation, especially with a future-oriented direction, being the second of a five-part series. Industry leaders invited to the event include Katherine Minarik, Chief Legal Officer at Uniswap Labs, and Gregory Tushar, Vice President of Institutional Products at Coinbase. Mark Uyeda, head of the SEC, aims to improve regulatory oversight of the crypto sector, focusing on nuance rather than treating all digital assets as the same phenomenon. Gary Gensler, the previous head of the SEC, classified nearly all cryptos as securities. There was very little nuance regarding crypto with the Gensler-led SEC. The event will be live-streamed on the SEC website starting at 1 p.m. ET on 11 April. The stream will include opening comments by SEC officials and a mediated roundtable discussion with industry leaders. The SEC, under a Biden administration, targeted many of the companies participating in the roundtable, including Coinbase, DRW, and Uniswap. Both DRW and Coinbase were sued by the SEC in 2023. Both were also relieved of their lawsuits under the new Trump administration. On April 5, Uyeda announced that he was considering seven staff statements, with five concerning crypto, due to Trump’s deregulation executive order and Elon Musk’s DOGE department recommendations. The announcement comes as the SEC wishes to change the department’s crypto policies, focusing on withdrawing staff statements that impede innovation in the American crypto industry. After the roundtable, participants can email their suggestions to the SEC so that a task force can devise a strategy to regulate the sector fairly. “Hearing the public’s concerns”, said Hester Peirce, head of SEC Crypto Task Force, “and suggestions helps the SEC create a clear, sensible, and fair path forward for the crypto industry. I look forward to this roundtable as we move toward crypto clarity for the benefit of the American public”. The SEC has created a five-part series of roundtables with the crypto sector. On March 21, the SEC held a roundtable titled ‘Spring Sprint Toward Crypto Clarity’. After this event, the SEC declassified stablecoins as securities, distinguishing them from known securities such as common stocks. The White House has never been so supportive of the crypto industry. President Trump has even created an Executive Order to create a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve. Stablecoins, as a result of the SEC roundtable, are considered nonsecurities, meaning that the transactions of such coins do not need to be reported. The regulatory deregulation comes when the economy faces various shocks based on supply chain disruptions, post-pandemic crises, and sanctions. One of the issues that the SEC has observed is a lack of innovation due to uncertainties regarding regulation. Many crypto leaders have said that they would prefer regulation so that they know where they stand regarding their business operations. The SEC has set strict requirements for stablecoins to be classified as nonsecurities, including a rule that U.S. dollars must back stablecoins on a one-to-one basis.",Cryptocurrency|News|Coinbase|Cryptocurrency News|Uniswap,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|UNI,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-09 03:35:03

A promising solution has emerged – DAO incentive programs, where members receive financial or token-based rewards to participate in governance actively. From Uniswap’s monthly stipends for delegates to GnosisDAO’s allocation of non-transferable voting power, DAOs aim to combat voter apathy and professionalize their governance structures. But are these incentives making DAOs more democratic or merely turning governance into a gig economy? Source: DeepDAO The apathy problem – Low turnout and high stakes Voter participation in many DAOs remains alarmingly low, often in the single digits. Even significant protocols like Maker and Uniswap struggle to attract more than 10% voter participation for critical proposals. This apathy undermines decentralization, as decisions become dominated by a few active whales rather than a genuinely decentralized community. Enter the ‘governance mining’ concept – rewarding users explicitly for their participation in governance activities. DAOs hope to turn passive token holders into active stakeholders by paying participants. Let’s explore recent case studies and their impact. Uniswap’s delegate rewards – $6,000 per month for active voting A prime example is the Uniswap delegate reward initiative, which the DAO extended in March 2025 for an additional six months, committing $540,000 from its treasury. Delegates can earn up to $6,000 monthly in UNI tokens if they meet stringent criteria, including at least 80% voting participation and active contribution to governance discussions. The community has widely supported this program, with a striking 99% approval – over 47 million UNI in favor. According to Uniswap governance forums, past cycles demonstrated increased engagement and turnout, suggesting incentives indeed drive participation. One delegate summarized the rationale and said, “This initiative will improve the quality of Uniswap governance by incentivizing informed voting.” Early data indicates that more UNI holders are actively delegating their tokens to prominent delegates, improving overall governance quality and quorum consistency. GnosisDAO – Voting power as a non-monetary incentive GnosisDAO adopted a different but equally intriguing approach, allocating non-transferable voting power rather than direct payments. In February 2025, the DAO selected 10 community delegates, each receiving 500 GNO of voting weight (around five percent of the supply), contingent on their active participation. Delegates who fail to vote consistently lose their privileged positions. This strategy addresses Gnosis’s historical problem of voter centralization, aiming to increase adequate voter turnout by 35-50%. Unlike Uniswap’s financial incentives drawn from treasury funds, Gnosis essentially minted new ‘governance-only tokens’ to boost decentralization – a distinct yet complementary solution to voter apathy. MakerDAO and others – Stipends and performance-based grants MakerDAO, a pioneer in DeFi governance, has been compensating delegates for over a year. Using a performance-based formula, Maker disbursed approximately 102,000 DAI to six top delegates in January 2025 alone. This example underscores that even well-established DAOs see merit in financially rewarding governance participation. Meanwhile, smaller or mid-sized DAOs have also explored KPI-driven reward mechanisms or platforms to tip and incentivize active governance participants, suggesting widespread industry acceptance of governance incentives. Results and concerns – Does paying for governance improve outcomes Early outcomes from incentive programs are promising. Uniswap, for example, now regularly meets quorum with proposals receiving detailed rationales and robust discussions from incentivized delegates. Likewise, Gnosis anticipates improved participation rates. Yet, several critical concerns remain. Moral hazard and mercenaries Critics argue that financial incentives may attract short-term participants driven solely by monetary gain rather than long-term project alignment. However, supporters note these rewards are relatively modest compared to the immense protocol value, positioning them more as fair compensation for effort than outright bribes. Centralization risk Continuously rewarding a select few delegates risks creating entrenched ‘DAO politicians,’ potentially limiting the diversity of voices in governance. Over-reliance on familiar delegates could inadvertently centralize power and decision-making. Cost and community sentiment Although Uniswap’s community overwhelmingly supported the incentive program, minor dissenting voices raised concerns about long-term sustainability and the potential misuse of DAO funds. However, the $540,000 expenditure remains relatively minor, with a treasury valued at billions. I believe that sustainable incentivization goes beyond simply paying participants – it lies in embedding incentives directly into the DAO’s economic design, forming what we call a ‘programmable economy.’ This approach includes an automatic reward system for actions like submitting proposals, voting and delegating while enabling members to assign their voting rights to trusted experts or specialized sub-DAOs focused on areas such as research or marketing. Experts, in turn, receive rewards for their governance contributions. This creates a self-reinforcing loop where community members, expert contributors and the DAO itself all benefit – helping transform participation from transactional to structural. Conclusion – Professionalizing DAO governance or creating governance mercenaries The trend of incentivizing governance participation through financial or token-based rewards has clearly gained traction among prominent DAOs. Initial results suggest significant improvements in voter turnout, engagement quality and decentralization efforts. However, these benefits have nuanced risks, including potential centralization and moral hazards. The ultimate test remains: Can these incentives scale broadly across DAO communities without centralizing power or creating a class of paid governance mercenaries? The upcoming governance cycles in Uniswap, Maker and Gnosis will offer crucial insights, determining whether incentivized governance can sustainably balance robust participation with genuine decentralization – an ongoing experiment with high stakes for the future of decentralized communities.

Florida federal court judge Federico Moreno granted approval of the settlement between O’Neal and the class group led by Daniel Harper in an April 1 order made available on April 8. The deal created a fund of up to $11 million for eligible class members and awarded $2.9 million in attorney fees and costs. All those who purchased Astrals NFTs from May 2022 to Jan. 15 and those who purchased the project’s native GLXY tokens up until mid-January are eligible. “The fee sought by lead class counsel has been reviewed and approved as fair and reasonable by plaintiffs,” Moreno’s order read. O’Neal was hit with the lawsuit in May 2023 over his founding and promotion of the Solana-based Astrals NFT project, which the suit claimed was an “offer and sale of unregistered securities.” The class group said they bought Astrals NFTs and “suffered investment losses” due to O’Neal’s “conduct” in promoting the project. In August, Judge Moreno recognized that the class suit had alleged that the former NBA player was a seller of the NFTs. O’Neal agreed to the settlement in November.

This decision follows recent moves by the Trump administration to loosen tough restrictions on the industry. According to industry executives, President Trump’s policies will spark innovation in crypto and capital flow. DOJ To Shift Regulatory Focus The Department announced the decision to disband the unit and focus on prosecuting the victimization of digital asset investors. US Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche noted that the DOJ is not a crypto regulator and that the previous administration used the Department to carry out reckless regulation through a prosecution strategy. “ Consistent with the narrowing of enforcement policy relating to digital assets, the Market Integrity and Major Funds Unit shall cease cryptocurrency enforcement to focus on other priorities, such as immigration and procurement frauds. The National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET) shall be disbanded effective immediately,” the statement read. This adds to the Trump administration’s recent moves to ease regulatory tension and usher in clearer rules. The previous administration embarked on a regulation-by-enforcement approach with a lack of clear rules, which led to a plethora of litigation against digital asset companies and executives. NCET was established in 2021 to regulate the industry, citing investor protection, among other reasons. The unit was involved in major cases, including the Tornado Cash and Avraham Eisenberg investigations. The Department charged Tornado Cash with money laundering, while Eisenberg was charged in the infamous Mango Market’s $100 million exploit. However, Gary Gensler’s led Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) played the most role in the last administration’s “war” on the market. The Commission has moved to pause the cases involving Binance and other firms pending a possible resolution. Trump’s Crypto Master Plan Taking Shape On the campaign trail, President Trump pledged to make the United States the world’s crypto and Artificial Intelligence (AI) capital. After his election win, Trump nominated pro-crypto candidates to key positions, restating his commitment to ushering in innovation. So far, the administration has established a crypto task force and issued an executive order for a strategic bitcoin reserve . Furthermore, states have also introduced legislation to establish a Bitcoin and crypto reserve. These policies have ignited a major institutional appetite in the U.S. crypto market. However, the White House’s recent tariff decisions have sent prices of crypto assets downwards in correlation to the stock market.",Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|BTCUSD|BTCUSDC|BTCUSDT|Cryptocurrency News|Ethereum News|USA|XBTUSD,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-09 03:44:59

Riskier assets like equities and crypto have been facing the most heat in this tariff war, with BTC extending its weekly losses to 11%, with altcoins led by Ethereum (ETH) on a free-fall with more than 25% weekly losses. As the world’s two largest economies enter a strong tariff war, massive uncertainty has gripped the global market. Thus, institutional selling for Bitcoin and other asset classes has also resumed with the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) offloading 3,296 BTC yesterday, the third-largest Bitcoin ETF outflow since inception. The net outflows across all US Bitcoin ETFs yesterday were $326 million. Source: Thomas Fahrer The market has witnessed a classic bull trap as the Bitcoin price jumped to $80,400 in a relief rally, only to give up all of its gains as Trump tariff war impact continues to build selling pressure. As per the Coinglass data , the overall crypto market liquidations have soared to $390 million amid the recent fall. Is Bitcoin Price Bracing for A Full-Blown Global Recession? Since the beginning of 2025, with the Donald Trump administration taking charge at the White House, Bitcoin price and other digital assets have come crashing down amid the Trump tariff wars. BTC is down over 18% year-to-date, with analysts pricing an even further correction to $70,000 and below. If the US stock market correction extends further, the chances of a full-blown recession are increasing with stocks, gold, crypto, and bond markets collapsing. Popular economist Peter Schiff noted : “If Trump’s secret agenda is to crash the stock market to bring down long-term interest rates, the plan already failed. The yield on the 30-year Treasury is now above 4.75%, its highest since February 19th. So the plan to crash the stock market is now crashing the bond market too”. Will the Fed Pivot Soon With Interest Rate Cuts in May? As the global markets are on turmoil, the expectations of a Fed rate cut in May are growing even more. Global Macro Investor and founder of Real Vision commented on the current market conditions, adding: “This feels a lot like Dec 2018 for those that were around. Powell signaled a pivot. I think we get the same, plus a trade resolution with China. Risk in stocks feels like 10% downside max vs 15% upside in 2 weeks, and 25% upside in a month or two, and much more in 6 months”. BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes also stated that this is the right time for the Fed intervention. He also expects the flow of Chinese money into Bitcoin if the uncertainty in the global macro increases further. In a recent post, Hayes highlighted the Federal Reserve’s precarious position, stating, “The Fed is on the clock, shit is breaking down.” Hayes pointed to contrasting market dynamics to underscore his concern. Previously, declining stock prices accompanied by a drop in 10-year Treasury yields were a positive signal. However, he noted that the current scenario of falling stocks paired with rising yields is deeply problematic, calling it “bad!” The post Why Bitcoin Price Crashed Under $75,000 Today? appeared first on CoinGape .",24/7 Cryptocurrency News|Bitcoin News|Arthur Hayes|Bitcoin (BTC) Price|fed rate cut|US recession,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinGape', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coingape,2025-04-09 03:54:55

Steep decline in AI agent creation Sharples said that it has “been about a week” since a new AI agent launched on Virtuals compared to late November when the platform was helping make over 1,000 new AI agents a day, according to Dune Analytics data. On Jan. 2, the Virtual Protocol ( VIRTUALS ) token hit an all-time high of $4.61, Blockworks data shows Virtuals’ daily revenue soared above $500,000. However, that seemed to mark the start of a downtrend, signaling a potential top for the AI agent sector. The decline continued even after a Jan. 25 announcement that the project had expanded to Solana . On April 7, Sharples pointed out that Virtuals generated ""less than $500"" in daily revenue, with its token price falling as low as $0.42. Virtuals Protocol’s AI agents have generated a total lifetime revenue of $39.1 million. Source: Dune Analytics The total AI agent market cap is $153.81 million, according to Dune Analytics. However, $76.6 million of that portion is allocated to AIXBT, which analyzes crypto sentiment on the social media site X to pick up on trends. AIXBT has dropped 92% since reaching its all-time high of $0.90 on Jan. 16. As of publication, it is trading at $0.07, according to CoinMarketCap data. DeGen Capital core contributor Mardo said the current market conditions have played a role in Virtuals’ decline, but it could also be tied to terms Virtuals has with builders, such as “withholding token taxes that other platforms freely give back.” It comes on the backdrop of the entire crypto market experiencing a downturn alongside global financial markets, as US President Donald Trump continues to ramp up tariffs and fears grow that it may lead to a recession. AI agents in current form are “garbage” However, many criticized AI agents for their lack of functionality. AI commentator, BitDuke said of the Virtual's revenue decline, “ChatGPT wrappers are no longer interesting, who could have guessed.” Related: Not every AI agent needs its own cryptocurrency: CZ AI commentator “DHH,” said in an April 8 X post, “I'm as AI positive as the next guy, but you're delusional if you think any AI agent is full-on replacing a great programmer today. Who knows about tomorrow, but that day hasn't arrived yet.” Meanwhile, Infinex founder Kain Warwick recently told Magazine that AI may possibly have a comeback despite the “first version of AI slop agents” being “garbage.” Magazine: Bitcoin heading to $70K soon?

Despite these fluctuations, major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) , XRP , and Solana (SOL) have demonstrated resilience, leading to speculation about their potential to transform a $100 investment into $10,000 . However, emerging projects such as MAGACOINFINANCE are capturing attention for their substantial growth prospects.

The price is now consolidating losses and facing hurdles near the $1.90 level. XRP price started a fresh decline below the $1.880 and $1.850 levels. The price is now trading below $1.850 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1.90 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might extend losses if it fails to clear the $1.90 resistance zone. XRP Price Faces Resistance XRP price failed to remain above the $2.00 level and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price declined below the $1.880 and $1.850 support levels. There was a move above the $1.720 and $1.700 levels. The price even declined below the $1.650 level. A low was formed at $1.610 and the price recently corrected some losses. There was a move above the $1.820 and $1.850 levels. The price cleared the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.168 swing high to the $1.610 low. However, the bears were active near the $1.950 resistance and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.168 swing high to the $1.610 low. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1.90 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading below $1.850 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $1.850 level. The first major resistance is near the $1.880 level. The next resistance is $1.90. A clear move above the $1.90 resistance might send the price toward the $2.00 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.050 resistance or even $2.0650 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.120. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $1.90 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1.750 level. The next major support is near the $1.70 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $1.70 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $1.650 support. The next major support sits near the $1.60 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level.

Cazenave noted, however, that crypto currently only accounts for 1% of global financial assets and is not yet significant enough to cause major “spillover effects” into traditional financial markets. She warned that interconnections between crypto and traditional markets are rapidly growing — particularly in the more crypto-friendly US — and called for closer monitoring. “Crypto-assets markets evolve quickly, in an often unpredictable manner, and we need to keep a close eye on these developments,” Cazenave said, adding: “Turmoil, even in small markets, can originate or catalyze broader stability issues in our financial system.” Cazenave’s concerns ranged from spot crypto exchange-traded funds and stablecoin use to hacks, scams and scandals — highlighting the recent $1.4 billion Bybit exploit and FTX’s collapse in November 2022.

While Cazenave said MiCA marked a “breakthrough” for crypto regulation, she added that there is “no such thing as a safe crypto-asset” and that more rules may need to be implemented to mitigate future risks. Related: EU could fine Elon Musk’s X $1B over illicit content, disinformation Her comments come as both crypto and the stock markets have experienced double-digit falls over the last few weeks as the Trump administration continues to follow through on its tariff plans. Europe lags US in crypto adoption While crypto adoption has accelerated in the US, Cazenave noted that over 95% of European banks remain on the sidelines, with no involvement in crypto-related activities. However, retail participation is on the rise, with an estimated 10% to 20% of European investors having crypto exposure, which is in line with growing global interest, Cazenave said. Most reports measuring US crypto adoption suggest that the range of adoption is between 15% and 28% of the population.

The Asia Dow, Nikkei 225, and Hang Seng had dropped around 2 percent during the late eastern financial trading session. With China anticipated to take the bullfight by the horns, investors have braced for a potential market recession ahead. Moreover, the ongoing tariffs will be largely felt by struggling households, as Wall Street experts forecast a spike in inflation in the near term. Crypto Market Falls in Tandem With notable selloffs in major global stock market indexes, the cryptocurrency industry has not been spared in the widespread panic selling. According to market data from Binance-backed Coinmarketcap, the total crypto market cap dropped by around 5.8 percent to hover about $2.38 trillion at the time of this writing. Bitcoin’s (BTC) price had dropped nearly 6 percent in the last 24 hours to trade around $75,359. Ethereum (ETH) price dropped over 10 percent in the past 24 hours to reach a daily low of about $1,386 before rebounding towards $1,425 at the time of this writing. As a result of the heightened volatility, more than $404 million was rekt from the crypto leveraged markets, with over $304 million involving long traders. What Next? The wider crypto market has suffered bearish sentiment amid low demand from whale investors. For instance, the U.S. spot BTC ETFs recorded a net cash outflow of about $327 million, led by BlackRocks IBIT. As Coinpedia previously noted, the crypto market will likely be trapped in further bearish sentiment until the ongoing tariff trade wars calm down. From a technical analysis standpoint, BTC price could experience a $10k drop in the coming days towards the support range between $63k and $67k, which coincides with the average price for Strategy’s BTC trove accumulation.

Since Ether ( ETH ) began trading in mid-2015, it has underperformed against Bitcoin ( BTC ) 85% of the time, analyst James Check said in an April 8 X post . Data shared by Check shows that Ether significantly outperformed Bitcoin in its early years from mid-2015 to around mid-2017, and it had two short periods in late 2019 and early 2020 when the ETH to BTC ratio was in Ether’s favor. However, Bitcoin has outperformed Ether for the past five years. ETH/BTC profitable days. Source: James Check The ETH/BTC ratio, which shows the price of Ether in terms of Bitcoin, fell to a five-year low of 0.018 on April 9, according to TradingView. The last time the ratio fell below its current level was December 2019, when ETH crashed to $125 while Bitcoin was trading at around $7,000. Ether has wiped out seven years of gains, plummeting a further 10% over the past 24 hours to under $1,450, below its 2018 market cycle peak. ETH fell to $1,400 in early trading on April 9, according to CoinGecko. Comparatively, Bitcoin lost 6% on the day in a fall to $75,000, which is still 275% higher than its peak during the bull market seven years ago. Ethereum backers air concern of “stagnation” Ethereum advocates have aired concerns about the network’s growth as the token struggled to gain traction earlier this year when Bitcoin hit a new price peak. “I love Ethereum. However, it’s time to face reality: Ethereum has had [around] the same number of active addresses for the past 4 years.” Web3 researcher Stacy Muur posted to X on April 8. Related: Ethereum price falls to 2-year low, but pro traders still have hope However, other researchers noted that most of the new addresses are on Ethereum layer-2 scaling networks, which have surged in terms of value locked onchain over the past couple of years, according to L2beat.

What’s Happening,https://coingape.com/trump-world-liberty-financial-selling-ethereum-eth-at-loss-whats-happening/,"Wallet supposedly belonging to Donald Trump’s DeFi project World Liberty Financial have been offloading their Ethereum holdings at a loss, as the ETH price faces yet another 10% drop today to $1,400. With 56.86% drop in ETH since the beginning of 2025, institutions seem to be losing interest in ETH very soon. World Liberty Financial Selling Ethereum At Loss Donald Trump’s decentralized finance (DeFi) venture, World Liberty Financial, appears to have started liquidating Ethereum (ETH) holdings at a significant loss. As per the data from blockchain analytics firm Arkham , a wallet potentially linked to the project has executed a sale of 5,471 ETH—worth approximately $8.01 million—at a price of $1,465 per ETH, roughly 4 hours ago. Previously, the organization reportedly spent $210 million to acquire 67,498 ETH at an average purchase price of $3,259 per token. With ETH trading significantly below its acquisition price, World Liberty is currently sitting on an estimated unrealized loss of $125 million. Source: Arkham Intelligence Apart from this, long-term Ethereum holders have also given up hope liquidating their holdings. A prominent Ethereum whale has finally exited their position after holding 10,000 ETH for over 900 days, according to Arkham Intelligence . The whale sold their entire ETH holdings for $15.71 million earlier today, locking in a profit of $2.75 million. The investor initially purchased the 10,000 ETH for $12.95 million at an average price of $1,295 in two transactions on October 4 and November 14, 2022. Despite continuing to hold when ETH touched $4,000, with a $27.6 million profit, the whale seems to have finally given up at lesser gains. Now, with World Liberty Financial offloading its holdings, investors are carefully waiting on the edge, which could trigger a major retail dump. What Happens to ETH Price Next? So far in 2025, Ethereum bears had the upper hand, breaking under every support level, and giving bulls several nightmares. Prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez has identified $1,200 as a potential support level for Ethereum (ETH) amidst its ongoing market downturn. Martinez’s analysis suggests that the $1,200 price point could act as a key area for ETH to regain stability while avoiding any further decline. Source: Ali Martinez Another analyst venturefounder believes Ethereum (ETH) is either at its cycle bottom or approaching it rapidly. The analyst speculates that ETH could reach its lowest point by the end of April. However, he expects the Fed rate cuts to come in May and the possible beginning of another round of quantitative easing (QE). This liquidity infusion could help ETH rally further from here.

Still trading at just $0.025 during its Phase 4, the token is drawing serious attention not just because of price speculation — but because of what the project is building underneath. The real question many are now asking is: Is there still time to get in before the next leg up? According to experts tracking the presale, the window is closing. Previous phases sold out faster than expected, and Phase 4 is already gaining momentum. Once this stage concludes, the price will rise to $0.03, and with the token’s launch price set at $0.06, even conservative estimates suggest early participants will see more than 2x returns before listing. But analysts are projecting much more — with some models pointing to a future value of $0.75 or even higher, which would represent a full 2,900% increase from the current entry point. So, what’s justifying this forecast? At its foundation, Mutuum Finance is more than just another DeFi protocol. It’s a decentralized system that enables both lending and borrowing of digital assets through smart contracts — all without the need for centralized control. Users deposit tokens to earn interest, while borrowers access capital by locking collateral. The platform supports both pooled lending and peer-to-peer agreements, offering flexibility that most protocols in the space lack. Mutuum’s dual-model design is also a key part of its appeal. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model allows users to deposit assets into shared liquidity pools. These pools are then accessed by borrowers who meet collateral requirements. Interest rates in this model aren’t fixed — they shift in real time based on how much of the pool is being used. When borrowing demand is high, returns for depositors increase, creating a balanced, incentive-driven system. At the same time, Mutuum also supports Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending, where users can set up custom loan agreements directly with one another. This model provides more flexibility and is especially useful for assets that don’t always fit into a pooled structure, such as meme tokens like PEPE or DOGE. It gives users more control over terms and risk, while expanding the protocol’s reach beyond traditional assets. This balance between stability and customization has brought in a wide range of early backers, including notable Ethereum holders, who are increasingly looking for opportunities that allow them to maintain exposure to ETH while putting their assets to work. Mutuum offers just that — a way to earn yield or borrow against holdings without selling off long-term positions. Beyond lending, the protocol is developing an overcollateralized stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. Minted from excess collateral within the system, it provides additional utility while remaining fully decentralized and transparent. Interest paid on stablecoin loans goes directly into the platform treasury — helping grow reserves while supporting the value of the native token. What’s especially driving investor interest now is the buy-and-distribute mechanism baked into Mutuum’s revenue model. As the protocol generates fees, a portion is used to buy MUTM on the open market. These purchased tokens are then distributed to mtToken stakers, creating regular buy pressure and aligning rewards with platform growth. This loop helps stabilize price while rewarding users who contribute to liquidity. All of this is coming together just as the presale nears its later stages. With over $6.3 million already raised and more than 8,000 holders participating, interest is growing — but supply is limited. The current phase, priced at $0.025, offers one of the final opportunities to secure MUTM before the next increase to $0.03. Once the token lists and exchange activity picks up, the market will ultimately decide the price — and based on what’s already in place, many expect that move to come fast. So, is it too late to get in? Not yet — but the clock is ticking. As Phase 4 continues and the token edges closer to its next price jump, early buyers still have a narrow window to enter before launch buzz and broader exposure take hold. With real utility, solid infrastructure, and clear investor demand, MUTM has positioned itself as more than a presale token — it’s shaping up to be one of the strongest contenders in DeFi this year.

The rejection at EMA 20 and 50 (~$1.91–$2.03) confirms strong resistance zones. The lower bound of the channel rests near $1.66, which held during the latest sell-off. Bear Flag Breakdown (April 6–7) After sideways consolidation above $2.03, XRP formed a bear flag before sharply breaking down. The target of this flag was nearly met at $1.66, showing precise technical behavior. Double Bottom Attempt / W Pattern (Lower Timeframes) On the 1H and 15m charts, XRP shows a potential W-reversal forming at $1.66–$1.70, which may confirm on a bullish breakout above $1.80–$1.85. Multi-Timeframe Analysis 4-Hour Chart Price is below both EMA 20 & 50, confirming ongoing bearish dominance. Bollinger Bands are wide, price hugging the lower band, suggesting oversold conditions. MACD: Histogram shows decreasing negative momentum, hinting at potential momentum shift. 1-Hour Chart Short-term divergence forming on MACD — lower lows in price vs. higher lows on MACD. If XRP breaks above $1.78–$1.80 on volume, a short-term rally may trigger. 15-Minute Chart XRP building a rounded bottom, testing resistance at $1.75–$1.78. A confirmed breakout here would validate the W-pattern and initiate a bullish leg. Key Support and Resistance Levels Major Support Zones $1.66 – Local double bottom and historical demand zone. $1.60 – Final support before freefall toward $1.40. Major Resistance Zones $1.80–$1.85 – Minor resistance; breakout zone. $1.91 (EMA 20) – Mid-level resistance from Bollinger mid-band. $2.03 (EMA 50 / Broken Support) – Major resistance for trend reversal confirmation. $2.18 – Previous Bollinger Band top; strong sell wall. EMA Structure EMA 20 (approx. $1.91) and EMA 50 (approx. $2.03) are both sloping downward, confirming medium-term downtrend. A break and close above $2.03 on the 4H would begin shifting momentum toward bullish territory.

Speaking at the European Parliament on Tuesday , ESMA executive director Natasha Cazenave highlighted crypto’s potential implications on financial stability. Her warning comes at a time when the markets are witnessing mayhem, following Trump’s tariffs impact. “EU financial markets are, as we speak, under severe strain coming from the broader political and geopolitical developments,” said Cazenave. Cazenave welcomed the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation ( MiCA ), which went into full implementation in December 2024. “It is an important milestone in addressing crypto-assets risks in the EU and we are committed to its successful implementation,” she said. ESMA “Renews” Crypto Warning The fresh warning from the securities regulator arrives a few months after it called for the delisting of stablecoins that were non-compliant with MiCA rules. Further, Bitcoin’s surge in total market value, reaching a record level of $100,000 earlier, has revived concerns about its risks to investors and the financial system. “These developments prompted us to renew our warning to investors in December 2024, to caution them against the crypto hype,” the ESMA executive noted. “We also made it clear that, despite MiCA, there will be no such thing as a safe crypto-asset.” Additionally, the deteriorating macro-economic conditions, shifting investors’ sentiments and the largest-ever crypto hack at Bybit this year, have seen “sudden and extreme fluctuations” in crypto prices. Over 95% of EU Banks Do Not Engage in Crypto Activities “Since 20225, we have been actively monitoring potential risks crypto assets could represent to financial stability,” Cazenave added. The ESMA noted that though risks to financial stability stemming from crypto-assets are increasing, they are “not significant yet”. Cryptos contribute only 1% to total global financial assets and have limited integration with traditional finance. Besides, more than 95% of banks in the EU do not engage in crypto-related activities, the agency added. “Crypto-assets markets are still comparatively small. However, in the current market environment, turmoil even in small markets can originate or catalyse broader stability issues in our financial system.” Cazenave stressed that ESMA should take a “forward-looking approach” and continued close monitoring as crypto markets are evolving rapidly.

Meanwhile, institutional interest in Bitcoin continues to grow, with major financial players preparing to embrace crypto. At Paris Blockchain Week, experts pointed out recent regulatory progress and predicted a surge in traditional finance adoption. Supporting this trend, Cboe announced a new Bitcoin futures product. Bitcoin Gains Momentum as Yuan Falls Tensions between the United States and China escalated once again after President Donald Trump imposed a 104% tariff on Chinese imports. In response to this, Beijing allowed the yuan to weaken significantly against the US dollar, reaching its lowest point since 2023. This move is seen as a strategic counter to rising trade pressures,and it is fueling speculation that China is preparing to devalue its currency even more. This could have far-reaching consequences for global markets and digital assets like Bitcoin. Dollar-to-Yuan exchange rate (Source: Bloomberg ) Analysts believe that expectations for yuan devaluation are rising rapidly. Ju Wang of BNP Paribas stated that the pressure on the Chinese currency is unlikely to ease anytime soon. The weakening yuan also reignited conversations about capital flight from China, with investors potentially moving their wealth into hard assets like Bitcoin. Arthur Hayes, the founder of BitMEX, suggested that such a capital shift is likely, which was a view shared by Bybit CEO Ben Zhou . He believes Bitcoin stands to benefit from Beijing’s currency strategy. Bybit has stepped up as a key platform for Chinese crypto investors. The exchange recently confirmed that users in mainland China can access its services without a VPN, although trading in yuan is still prohibited. Still, its growing accessibility and popularity, particularly among derivatives traders, positions it well to absorb an influx of capital seeking refuge from traditional markets. As the trade war deepens, volatility in currency markets is becoming the new norm. Brent Donnelly , president of Spectra FX Solutions, recently talked about the potential for extreme fluctuations in foreign exchange markets as a result of geopolitical uncertainty. Meanwhile, the US dollar itself showed considerable weakness since Trump’s return to office, with the DXY Dollar Index plunging from nearly 110 to below 103. Julien Bittel from Global Macro Investor said that the drop between late February and early March was one of the biggest declines in a decade. Given Bitcoin’s historical inverse relationship with the US dollar, a continued decline in the greenback could provide more momentum for the current bull market. With both the yuan and dollar under pressure, Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a safe haven for capital navigating the chaos of global macroeconomic shifts. Big Banks Ready to Embrace Bitcoin Despite the turbulence caused by US trade tariffs and the broader market meltdown, industry leaders at major crypto firms are still very optimistic about institutional Bitcoin adoption in 2025. At Paris Blockchain Week on April 8, Messari CEO Eric Turner and Sygnum Bank co-founder Thomas Eichenberger shared a bullish outlook on how traditional finance will increasingly embrace Bitcoin and crypto services later this year. Turner pointed out that while the second quarter of 2025 might stay a bit subdued, he anticipates major developments in the latter half of the year. He pointed to a broader wave of regulatory acceptance, not only in the United States but globally, as a major driver of this shift. With key advancements in market structure and stablecoin regulation gaining traction, Turner is confident that the crypto space is on the brink of a major transition toward institutional legitimacy and integration. Rather than focusing only on the pro-crypto narrative surrounding President Donald Trump, Turner said that the collective stance of regulatory bodies like the SEC is what truly matters. He argued that the convergence of supportive policies across various government agencies is really laying the groundwork for sustainable growth in the crypto market. Paris Blockchain Week Eichenberger fully agreed with this, and stated that international banks with a presence in the US are closely monitoring the regulatory landscape and are preparing to roll out crypto services. These banks, he said, have long had strategic plans for offering services like crypto custody and spot trading but were previously hesitant because of fears of regulatory pushback. Now, with a more transparent and favorable regulatory environment emerging, Eichenberger believes that banks no longer have any reason to hesitate. He expects that many global financial institutions will act on their plans and begin launching crypto services in earnest throughout 2025. Cboe Unveils New Bitcoin Futures Product Turner and Eichenberger’s predictions might not be so far fetched, as the Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) recently unveiled plans to launch a new Bitcoin futures derivative product later this month. According to an April 7 announcement , the exchange plans to introduce FTSE Bitcoin Index futures on April 28, pending regulatory approval. Part of Cboe’s April 7 announcement The futures will be based on the VanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF (XBTF) and will be cash-settled, representing one-tenth of the value of the FTSE Bitcoin Index. Contracts will settle on the last business day of each month. Crypto futures trading is a type of trading where you agree to buy or sell a cryptocurrency, like Bitcoin, at a set price on a future date. Instead of owning the actual crypto, you're speculating on its price going up or down. This is the first product developed through Cboe’s collaboration with FTSE Russell, the index division of the London Stock Exchange Group. It is expected to complement the exchange’s existing suite of Bitcoin derivatives, including the recently launched Bitcoin US ETF Index Options (CBTX) and MBTX. Cboe’s global head of derivatives, Catherine Clay, pointed out that there is a growing market demand for flexible, capital-efficient exposure to crypto. She also believes that the launch comes at a pivotal time for the industry. Cboe is a longstanding institution in financial markets, and played a foundational role in Bitcoin’s integration into traditional finance, dating back to its first Bitcoin futures launch in December of 2017. The exchange also took recent steps to modernize its approach by including a February announcement to implement weekday 24-hour trading to align even more with the crypto market's nonstop activity. While Bitcoin ETFs gained a lot of traction, futures are still a significant part of the ecosystem. In March, open interest in Bitcoin futures took a major hit, with $10 billion wiped out because of excessive leverage. Despite this volatility, innovation in the futures market continues to grow. Coinbase announcement regarding 24/7 trading (Source: Coinbase ) Coinbase, for instance, revealed plans to offer round-the-clock trading of Bitcoin and Ethereum futures to US customers. Additionally, Singapore Exchange (SGX) is preparing to roll out Bitcoin perpetual futures in the latter half of 2025.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-09 05:43:11

Ether (ETH) dived 10%, leading losses among major tokens, with xrp (XRP), dogecoin (DOGE), BNB Chain’s BNB, Solana’s SOL and Cardano’s ADA down more than 5%. Overall market capitalization decreased 6%, extending a 7-day slide to nearly 15%. Smaller tokens showed even deeper losses, with trendy upstart Berachain’s BERA down 20% and memecoins bonk (BONK), pepe (PEPE) and floki (FLOKI) down more than 9%. Traders’ retreat from crypto majors continued, reversing all gains from Tuesday’s relief rally as Trump pushes forward efforts to drastically reorder global trade. Tariffs on any Chinese goods were hiked to 104%, along with import taxes on over 60 trading partners. U.S. treasuries extended their selloff, with 30-year yields soaring more than 20 basis points to 4.98%. That’s a U-turn from the usual safe haven status that bond investors enjoy and a deeply worrying sign for traders. Some market watchers speculated the sell-off may have been caused by a forced liquidation of a large player. ""Since Friday's close to now the 30-year yield is up 56 bps, in three trading days,"" Jim Bianco, the well-followed founder of Bianco Research, said in an X post. ""The last time this yield rose this much in 3 days (close to close) was January 7, 1982, when the yield was 14%."" ""This kind of historic move is caused by a forced liquidation, not human managers make decisions about the outlook for rates at midnight ET,"" he added. Rising yields mean bond prices are falling and increase the cost of borrowing for the U.S. government, which could exacerbate the federal deficit, already strained by heavy debt levels. Investors worry that a prolonged trade war could weaken global trade, disrupt supply chains, and slow U.S. economic growth. This could further pressure U.S equity markets and bitcoin, which tends to mirror the ebbs and flows of U.S. markets. The current selloff suggests the market is pricing in inflation now, but prolonged uncertainty could flip this dynamic. Bears take charge Meanwhile, some traders are eyeing a bitcoin drop to as low as $70,000 in the near term amid the tariff escalations, a move that could further pressure crypto majors. “For investors, the short-term outlook calls for caution, while a further drop to $70,000–$75,000 for Bitcoin is possible if trade tensions escalate, yet this dip presents a buying opportunity for the long haul,” Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “Dollar-cost averaging into Bitcoin is a prudent move now, with an eye on altcoins like Solana for higher-risk upside later.” Lee remained upbeat for recovery to peak prices if the situation lightens in the coming months. “If macro conditions stabilize or pro-crypto policies emerge, we could see Bitcoin hit $95,000–$100,000 by late 2025, lifting the market cap past $3 trillion again. While tariff pressures and a risk-off sentiment have hit altcoins hard, Bitcoin’s resilience and rising dominance near 60% suggest the ecosystem’s fundamentals remain solid, supported by institutional adoption and long-term tailwinds like the halving cycle,” he added.",Markets|Bitcoin|tariff|Ether,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-09 05:46:23

This was the first time that the institutional interest in the token received massive support from the bulls. Since then, the company has been constantly acquiring Bitcoin, which has now reached over 500,000. With this, MicroStrategy has become one of the giant whales, and its position could have a significant impact on the BTC price rally. The last time MicroStrategy acquired 22,048 Bitcoin was at an average price of $86,969 and it holds over 528,000 BTC. The company had acquired BTC when the price was close to $100K, and now that the price has dropped below $80,000, Micheal Saylor has not yet released any new data on acquisition. Moreover, he has not even stated that the company has not sold any BTC during the sell-off as he did before. This raises significant concerns about the upcoming price action and questions regarding why Microstrategy is not purchasing more Bitcoin. Why This Should be a Matter of Concern Micheal Saylor, the former CEO of MicroStrategy, keeps on buying Bitcoin no matter what the price is. It worked perfectly fine in the times when the markets were booming, but now, when the liquidity is tightening again and volatility is rising, more acquisitions may turn the system fragile. After Trump’s Liberation Day, the markets collapsed, and the BTC price plunged hard below $74,500. With the imposition of additional tariffs on China, the trade war has again begun as the BTC price rose above $80,000 but has dropped again to close to $75,000. If the price drops close to Saylor’s average price of around $67,000, he may need to add collateral or liquidate. The recent MicroStrategy’s official filings to the SEC disclose the possibility of liquidating BTC if the price drops below the collateral thresholds. Will This Drag the Bitcoin (BTC) Price Lower? The Federal Reserve held an emergency meeting regarding the interest rates but has released no public statement. Trump wants a 2% rate cut, but that’s not happening before the next scheduled FOMC meeting in May. Due to this, the uncertainty over the global markets as well as the crypto markets may persist, which could negatively impact the BTC price rally. The BTC price continues to trade within a descending parallel channel and dropped below the average bands and the crucial support at $76,763. While the technicals flashed mixed signals, the chart patterns suggest the bullish strength is fading slowly. This hints towards the possibility of entering the support zone between $73,971 and $72,590 in the coming days. If the price fails to trigger a rebound and a sustained upswing, a plunge below $70,000 could be imminent.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-09 05:47:45

While the broader crypto market is also bleeding , the catalyst for this correction appears to be rooted in geopolitics and mounting fears of a recession. BREAKING: Bitcoin falls below $75,000 as crypto markets erase -$500 billion since the April 2nd high. pic.twitter.com/uFBKUms881 — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) April 9, 2025 The back-and-forth tariff war is heating China dumped $50B in U.S. treasuries, and now the U.S. is hitting back with a 104% tariff on Chinese goods, starting in just hours. Until clear progress is made or retail traders start shorting or selling off heavily, extreme volatility is expected across all markets. Trump’s Tariff War Sends Shockwaves Across Risk Assets The immediate trigger came from Donald Trump’s aggressive 104% tariff on Chinese goods, which went into effect recently. This move has rattled global investors and sparked a broader risk-off sentiment. Equities, bonds, and cryptocurrencies are all reacting to the rising trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies. Bitcoin, known for its sensitivity to macroeconomic instability, faced strong selling pressure. Institutional activity confirmed this as BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) offloaded 3,296 BTC in a single day—marking its third-largest outflow since inception. Altogether, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs saw net outflows of $326 million on the day, adding to the downward momentum. Market Trapped in a False Rally Bitcoin briefly rallied to $80,400 in what seemed like a relief bounce. However, that rally quickly faded, and prices slipped back into a downward spiral, forming a classic bull trap. Over $390 million in crypto liquidations followed, according to Coinglass , as traders were caught on the wrong side of the move. Altcoins saw a short-lived bounce, with ETH climbing 2.04% to $1,567, while SOL and XRP jumped nearly 5%. Dogecoin led the hourly surge with a 5.5% spike, and even BNB edged up 1.49%. However, the overall crypto market cap still dropped 4.27% in the past 24 hours, suggesting this rally was driven more by speculation than real improvement, likely fueled by false crypto news . Analysts See This as a Global Threat Economists now warn that the current situation bears similarities to late 2018, when the Fed was forced to shift course due to a weakening economy. Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, said that the Fed is “on the clock,” pointing out that the current combination of falling equities and rising bond yields is a troubling sign. Peter Schiff echoed this concern, stating that if Trump’s goal was to crash the market to lower interest rates, it’s now backfiring, with long-term Treasury yields climbing to new highs. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Price May be at Risk as Institutions Halt BTC Acquisitions—Should You be Worried? , How Low BTC to Go?

The whale initially bought a total of 10,000 Ether ( ETH ) across two transactions in October and November 2022 for $13 million at the time for an average price of $1,295 per token, blockchain analytics service Lookonchain said in an April 8 X post. “He didn’t sell when Ether broke through $4,000. But today, he exited with a $2.75 million profit. The profit at the peak was $27.6 million,” Lookonchain said. Source: Lookonchain The whale sold when Ether was around $1,578, according to Lookonchain. Within the period that the whale wallet was holding its stack, Ether hit a high of $4,015 on Dec. 9, CoinGecko data shows . Ether is sitting at around $1,426, down 24% over the last seven days amid a broader market sell-off sparked by the Trump administration’s sweeping global tariffs. ETH hit its all-time high of $4,878 on Nov. 10, 2021, about a year before the whale’s first purchase. Trump’s World Liberty Financial sells part of ETH stash In a separate April 9 post to X, Lookonchain said the Donald Trump-backed crypto project, World Liberty Financial (WLF), might have also sold some of its Ether stash at a loss. “A wallet possibly linked to World Liberty sold 5,471 ETH ($8.01M) at $1,465,” Lookonchain wrote. Source: Lookonchain Before the supposed sale, Lookonchain said World Liberty Financial had a stash of 67,498 Ether, which it bought at an average price of $3,259.

On April 7, an unidentified crypto whale had to inject 10,000 Ether — worth more than $14.5 million, to save their position of 220,000 Ether worth more than $300 million from liquidation amid the market slump.

Trump’s reciprocal tariffs came into effect today, including a cumulative 104% levy on Chinese imports. Traders were also disappointed by the lack of concrete developments in trade negotiations, even though President Trump spoke with various leaders from major trading partners. According to the Asian Development Outlook, developing Asian economies are projected to see a gradual deceleration in GDP growth, from 5.0% in 2024 to 4.9% in 2025 (the slowest since 2022) and further to 4.7% in 2026. Meanwhile, investors are awaiting the release of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s March policy meeting minutes, due later in the day, to gauge policymakers' rate cut pain point. Japan ( NKY:IND ) fell 4.19% toward 31,800 while the broader Topix Index tumbled 2.9% to 2,362 on Wednesday, giving back gains from the previous session. The Japanese yen appreciated past 146 per dollar on Wednesday, rising for the second straight session. Japan also faces a 24% tariff on its goods and a 25% levy on car shipments to the US. Meanwhile, Trump said that Japan is sending a team to negotiate on trade with the US, while Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba revealed that he told Trump in a phone call to rethink his tariff policies. On the domestic front, Japan’s current account surplus surged to a record high in February, driven by strong export growth and a decline in imports, adding further support to the yen. The consumer confidence index in Japan dropped to 34.1 in March 2025 from a downwardly revised 34.8 in the previous month, declining for the fourth straight month and reaching its lowest level since March 2023. China ( SHCOMP ) rose 0.21% to below 3,100 while the Shenzhen Component lost 0.9% to 9,340 on Wednesday, reversing gains from the previous session as US President Donald Trump is set to impose a hefty 104% tariff on China in what appears to be an all-out trade war, and the offshore yuan climbed toward 7.38 per dollar on Wednesday, rebounding from three consecutive sessions of losses, supported by a depreciating US dollar. In the meantime, Beijing on Tuesday vowed to “fight to the end” to protect its interests, accusing the U.S. of engaging in economic blackmail, contrasts with the White House's claim that Trump won't back down on tariffs, and that China wants a deal, but doesn't know how to make one. Meanwhile, during a call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Tuesday, Premier Li Qiang emphasized that China’s macroeconomic policies are designed to address uncertainties and expressed confidence in sustained growth this year. Both China and Europe are preparing for significant impacts from new U.S. tariffs, with China facing a 104% surtax and Europe a 20% levy. Caution also grew ahead of China’s March CPI and PPI data due later this week, with deflation risks still looming. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell 1.78% to 19,662 in early trade on Wednesday, reversing strong gains from the previous session. India ( SENSEX ) fell 0.53% to 73,865 in early deals on Wednesday, erasing gains from the previous session. However, the RBI's decision to cut interest rates by 25 bps to 6% capped the fall, despite the central bank revising its GDP forecast downward to 6.5% from 6.7% for FY2025-26, while inflation was revised to 4% from 4.2%. Australia ( AS51 ) fell 1.91% to around 7,360 on Wednesday, reversing gains from the previous session. The Australian dollar appreciated toward $0.60 on Wednesday, rebounding slightly from five-year lows. Australia will face the minimum 10% levy, with Trump taking a particular interest in blocking Australian beef amid long-standing restrictions on US beef exports to the country. In the U.S., on Tuesday, all three major indexes ended in red as optimism over global tariff negotiations soured after President Trump confirmed the imposition of a 104% tariff on China, effective tomorrow. Meanwhile, the Treasury Department auctioned $58 billion in 3-year notes on Tuesday, marking the first coupon supply since the tariff announcement. U.S. stock futures declined Wednesday as President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs came into effect today, including a 104% levy on Chinese imports: Dow -1.88% ; S&P 500 -2.04% ; Nasdaq -2.08% .

On Sunday, CoinDesk discussed the possibility of pronounced downside volatility in risk assets due to a potential unwinding of the Treasury market arbitrage bets, a dynamic that catalyzed the 2020 crash. Per observers, the unwinding of the so-called carry trades, involving hedge funds exploiting minor price discrepancies between Treasury futures and securities, has begun. That's evident from the nearly 70 basis points rise in the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield to 4.5%. The 30-year yield has seen a similar rise. Note that yields move in the opposite direction of prices and typically drop during risk aversion as investors seek refuge in government bonds. ""It's all running vertical now with 30-year Treasury yields on the cusp of hitting the 5% mark. For some context, 10-year yields in the US were at a low of 3.88% on Monday. This points to further liquidation in Treasuries and that's a sign that we are seeing distress in the parts of the market that we should not normally talk about i.e. funding, credit, repo,"" ForexLive's analyst Justin Low said in a market update discussing the implosion of the basis trade. Low added that it's ""all going sideways at the moment"" as a sharp rise in yields itself can have a far-reaching impact on markets, housing and the economy. Stocks drop, BTC under pressure Futures tied to the S&P 500, Wall Street's benchmark equity index, fell 2% amid increased volatility in the Treasury market. Bitcoin fell briefly below $75,000 early today and has since recovered to trade near $76,000, CoinDesk data showed. The MOVE index, which represents the options-implied 30-day price turbulence in the Treasury market, jumped to 140, the highest since October 2023, according to data source TradingView. The worsening of the risk sentiment has raised the risk of BTC falling to the $73.8K-$74.4K range, where holders of bullish long positions in the perpetual futures listed on major exchanges face liquidation risks, according to data tracked by analytics firm Hyblock Capital. Liquidation represents the forced closure of positions by exchanges due to margin shortages. Large long liquidations often add to downside price volatility.

Stablecoin protocol M^0 is expanding to Solana , allowing developers to create digital dollars that are tailored to their needs and easily interchangeable with high liquidity, the firm said in a press release shared with crypto.news. KAST, a neobank built on stablecoins, will be the first to use M^0’s platform on Solana. According to the press release, the company plans to create two digital dollars to tokenize deposits and later expand into payments and savings. “By issuing our own stablecoin, we ensure full transparency, with all customer deposits represented on-chain. Solana was the clear choice for deployment, given our strong existing partnership and its advantages in speed and low fees.” Raagulan Pathy, co-founder & CEO of KAST You might also like: Tether in US regulatory talks over stablecoin as possible ‘settlement currency’ Joao Reginatto, Chief Strategy Officer at M^0, explains that the company’s decision to bring M^0 to Solana is driven by its goal to empower builders to “create stablecoins that are not only interoperable, liquid, and tailored to their use cases, but that can also perform at any scale.” The latest expansion follows just a few months after M^0 teamed up with the Cosmos-based Noble blockchain to shake up the stablecoin market, which is mainly controlled by Tether ( USDT ) and Circle ( USDC ). Earlier in December 2024, Noble launched its new dollar-backed token, USDN, powered by M^0’s decentralized stablecoin infrastructure. In June 2024, M^0 raised $35 million in a Series A fundraise led by Bain Capital Crypto, Bain Capital’s crypto investment platform.

The Department of Justice has officially shut down its National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET), a unit previously tasked with targeting crypto-related crime. At the same time, the administration has introduced new import tariffs, including a 34% levy on Chinese goods, signaling a return to aggressive trade posturing. While critics warn of rising tensions and regulatory gaps, some analysts believe these measures are part of a broader strategy to reshape US positioning in both digital finance and global commerce. DOJ Disbands National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team Amid Trump-Driven Policy Shift The Department of Justice (DOJ) is reportedly disbanding its National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET), according to a leaked internal memo seen by Fortune and cited in a report released April 8. The four-page document, authored by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, asserts that the Justice Department is “not a digital assets regulator,” criticizing the previous administration’s approach to crypto -related enforcement. The memo pointedly accuses the Biden administration of engaging in “regulation by prosecution,” a strategy Blanche described as reckless. The NCET, launched in October 2021 under President Joe Biden, was tasked with investigating and prosecuting crimes involving cryptocurrency platforms and digital asset service providers. At the time, then-Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco framed the unit as a necessary step to “dismantle the financial ecosystem” supporting digital asset–related crime. Since becoming operational in February 2022, the NCET played a significant role in targeting crypto-related fraud, sanctions evasion, ransomware payments, and money laundering schemes. The timing of the disbandment is no coincidence. The move comes just months after President Donald Trump signed an executive order in January reshaping US crypto policy, part of a broader effort to position the United States as a global leader in digital asset innovation. The dismantling of NCET is reportedly effective immediately. Trump’s Crypto Policy: From the Campaign Trail to the White House Trump’s pro-crypto stance has been a defining aspect of his return to the presidency. Throughout his 2024 campaign and beyond, he emphasized a future in which the US would embrace blockchain innovation rather than stifle it. His proposals have included creating a US strategic Bitcoin reserve, supporting the use of decentralized finance (DeFi), and establishing the country as a global hub for digital assets. Moreover, Trump appointed a pro-crypto chairman to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), signaling a fundamental shift in how regulatory agencies are expected to approach the sector. The SEC under the new leadership has already begun reviewing several crypto-related ETF applications more favorably and is working on streamlining compliance for digital asset firms. However, this new direction has not come without controversy. Despite—or perhaps because of—Trump’s apparent support for the industry, critics have raised red flags about potential conflicts of interest. Trump and members of his inner circle have deep personal and financial ties to several high-profile crypto ventures. These include the World Liberty Financial (WLFI) DeFi platform, the Official Trump (TRUMP) meme coin, and a series of crypto-related ETFs being launched by Trump Media in partnership with Crypto.com. The WLFI platform recently made headlines due to its USD1 stablecoin, which some lawmakers fear could undermine bipartisan efforts in Congress to establish clear, centralized regulations for stablecoins. In late March, five Senate Democrats issued a letter urging top regulators to assess the ramifications of a politically-affiliated stablecoin. That concern was echoed earlier this month when Representative Maxine Waters suggested that Trump’s ultimate goal might be to challenge or even replace the US dollar with USD1. In parallel, the TRUMP meme coin became embroiled in allegations of insider trading—accusations that were later dismissed by some blockchain analysts as the result of MEV (maximal extractable value) bot activity rather than direct manipulation. Nevertheless, the incident added fuel to the fire of concern about the entanglement between federal policymaking and personal digital asset investments. What’s Next for Crypto Enforcement in the US? With the NCET dissolved, questions remain over how the federal government will handle criminal cases involving cryptocurrency. While the DOJ is stepping back from centralized enforcement, it’s unclear whether its individual field offices will continue pursuing crypto-related crimes through traditional financial crime units, or whether a new structure will emerge under Trump’s revamped digital asset policy framework. Legal experts have expressed concern that disbanding the NCET without a clear replacement could create a gap in enforcement and oversight—potentially emboldening malicious actors during a time of rapid digital asset adoption. Global Trade Tensions Could Ease as Trump Eyes Deal With China Amid Tariff Fallout In related news, global markets are on edge following US President Trump’s announcement of sweeping new import tariffs earlier this month, raising fears of a renewed trade war between the world’s two largest economies. However, insiders and analysts suggest the aggressive moves may ultimately be a strategic gambit aimed at securing a landmark trade agreement with China. On April 2, Trump shocked global markets by announcing a 10% baseline tariff on all imported goods starting April 5. Most notably, Chinese imports face a steep 34% levy beginning April 9, reigniting concerns over economic decoupling and retaliatory escalation. Equity markets faltered following the news, while crypto markets—often considered risk-sensitive—saw increased volatility and uncertainty. Despite the seemingly aggressive stance, Raoul Pal, CEO and founder of Global Macro Investor, believes the Trump administration’s tough rhetoric may be more calculated than confrontational. In an April 8 post on X, Pal suggested the current negotiations are designed to extract a favorable deal from Beijing rather than to wage a prolonged trade war. “In the end, almost all the other tariff negotiations and rhetoric are all about getting China to agree a deal,” Pal wrote. “That is the big prize, and both China and the US understand it and need it.” Pal also emphasized the strategic nature of the US efforts to prevent tariff circumvention, noting that Washington is targeting rerouting tactics via nations like Mexico and Vietnam, which have previously been used as alternative trade channels by Chinese exporters seeking to dodge US levies. China Fires Back With Matching Tariffs In a direct tit-for-tat response, China imposed its own 34% tariff on all American imports, effective April 10, according to a report by state-run media outlet Xinhua. China’s Foreign Ministry characterized the US tariffs as “economic bullying” and issued a stern warning that it would “fight till the end” if necessary. The retaliatory measures from Beijing significantly dim hopes for a short-term resolution. China, which surpassed the United States as the world’s largest trading nation in 2012, is determined to maintain its status and global influence amid rising protectionist threats. The latest moves mark a critical juncture for global trade. While both sides claim to be acting in national interest, observers warn that continued escalation could trigger ripple effects across supply chains, inflation metrics, and global financial markets. The crypto market, already experiencing heightened sensitivity due to macroeconomic uncertainty and shifting Federal Reserve policy, is closely watching the outcome of the US–China trade talks. Analysts suggest a deal—or even the perception of progress—could serve as a powerful bullish signal for digital assets. Nansen analysts estimate that crypto markets now have a 70% chance of bottoming out by June 2025, depending on the resolution of trade tensions and other macroeconomic drivers. Strategic Moves or Political Grandstanding? While Trump’s bold tariff plan has been met with backlash from economists and global leaders alike, some insiders view it as a strategic ploy meant to bolster US leverage. According to Raoul Pal, Trump’s primary aim is to force China into a deal that benefits the US economy and shores up domestic manufacturing—two of the president’s key policy priorities. Still, not everyone is convinced that a resolution is within reach. Skeptics argue that even if the tariff measures are intended as a negotiating tool, the damage to international relations and market confidence may be difficult to reverse. With the April 9 and 10 deadlines for the respective tariff implementations now in place, the world is watching to see whether cooler heads will prevail. The markets, particularly the crypto sector, are likely to remain volatile until a clearer picture of US–China trade policy emerges. Some investors hold out hope that behind closed doors, the two nations are working toward a deal that would not only ease economic pressure but also establish a new baseline for cooperation in a digitally driven global economy. Until then, the crypto community and broader financial markets will continue to navigate a precarious environment shaped by both political maneuvering and economic necessity.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-09 06:00:00

AMP has been struggling with a bearish trend for the past few months. Despite this, its strong fundamentals suggest it could be a solid long-term investment. Crypto analysts suggest that the coming weeks will steadily increase the cryptocurrency’s value. A bullish rally may be expected in the latter part of 2025, potentially pushing AMP above $0.00694.

Additionally, the coin has experienced a considerable gain of 3.19% over the last 24 hours. The price is trading at $0.00323, which is just below the average range as the bears remained in the lead during the week. Will AMP reach $0.010? AMP’s resistance level is at $0.005, yet a break above this level is possible if sufficient buying momentum builds.

The highest price target for AMP in 2025 is $0.00694. Will AMP ever reach $1? Amp has never spiked above the $0.12 level. Even this price mark was observed only once at the start of the token’s launch, and AMP has never seen this level again. It seems highly unlikely for AMP to achieve $1 soon. Will AMP reach $10? According to the price prediction, AMP will not achieve this level in the next 10 years until something unusual happens. Considering AMP’s current market cap of only $423.6 million, the scenario seems almost impossible. What will AMP be worth in 2030? The highest price of AMP in 2030 is expected to be around $0.02622. Does AMP have a good long-term Future? Amp is trading near its average price level if observed over the longest price period levels. It can be a good long-term investment, as its price is expected to double in 2026 and reach $0.03008 by 2031.

Despite a 4.1% recovery in the past 24 hours bringing it back to $79,825, Bitcoin remains down 26% from its all-time high of over $109,000 recorded in January 2025. Market sentiment remains mixed, as investors weigh on-chain data, short-term volatility, and the broader macroeconomic environment.

Bitcoin Open Interest Reflects Cautious Sentiment Bitcoin’s open interest metric has revealed cautious behavior among leveraged traders. CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn reported a 17.8% drop in Bitcoin open interest over the past week. This decline represents a significant reduction in the number of outstanding derivative contracts and may reflect investor hesitation following recent price volatility. Historically, such sharp declines in open interest have occurred before major market rebounds, as speculative leverage is flushed out of the system. With leverage reset, market participants may begin re-entering positions, especially if prices find a strong support level or if further whale accumulation signals renewed bullish momentum. Bitcoin Open Interest dropped -17.8% 🩸 This is over the last 7 days – shedding billions in leverage. Over the last 2 years, these flush-outs often set the stage for major buy opportunity’s. pic.twitter.com/wXIxSXr7Nz — Maartunn (@JA_Maartun) April 8, 2025 Accumulation Trends Signal Long-Term Confidence Meanwhile, there has been a notable trend in the behavior of long-term holders and whales. According to on-chain data shared by CryptoQuant contributor Onchained, a substantial number of accumulating addresses have continued to buy Bitcoin aggressively even during the asset’s climb to new highs. This cohort’s realized capitalization has surged from around $20 billion in 2023 to $160 billion in 2025, with BTC supply held by these entities increasing from approximately 800,000 to 3 million BTC. This trend suggests that rather than scaling back during price increases, large holders significantly accelerated their buying efforts, indicating a high level of conviction. The analyst wrote: This indicates the average acquisition price per bitcoin for accumulating addresses rose substantially, yet accumulation accelerated rather than slowed. A strong evidence of high-conviction buying regardless of price increases. Onchained also noted a widening gap between retail and whale realized capitalization, pointing to the growing role of high-capital investors in market dynamics. These whale wallets, typically less reactive to short-term market swings, are continuing to remove BTC from circulation, a pattern that may contribute to future supply constraints. Onchained’s analysis further highlights three key implications: a growing supply-side pressure as more BTC enters inactive wallets, strong conviction from holders through all market phases, and the potential for future supply shocks as long-term accumulation continues.

Investors will be left with no other option but Bitcoin, says crypto exec “First time the thought hit me and didn’t feel like theory but an actual truth to grapple with,” Parks added. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley shared a similar view, noting that with trust in the US dollar waning and other foreign currencies seen as “even weaker,” investors are left with fewer choices. He argued that gold, typically seen as a safe harbor amid uncertainty, also has drawbacks around shipping and storage and implied that Bitcoin may be the only option left. “You wind up buying Bitcoin,” Horsley said. Source: Michael Saylor The US Dollar Index — which tracks its strength against a basket of major currencies — is trading at 102.193, down 5.84% since Jan. 1, according to TradingView. However, Wall Street analysts were mistaken in thinking that the tariffs would bolster the US dollar, according to a recent Wall Street Journal report . On April 2, Trump signed an executive order establishing a 10% baseline tariff on all imports from all countries, which took effect on April 5. Harsher reciprocal tariffs on trading partners with which the US has the largest trade deficits then kicked in on April 9. Uncertainty around the tariffs and fears of a broader recession have been major catalysts for a wide traditional and crypto market decline. Bitcoin ( BTC ) is trading at $76,301, down 18.37% since Jan. 1, according to CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin author Saifedean Ammous said in an April 8 X post that America’s issue isn’t with one specific country’s deficit but with aggregate deficits worldwide due to having a “fiat money printer.” Related: Bitcoin weekly RSI hits bull market low as trader sees $70K BTC price bottom “An ever-increasing number of Americans can live off the money printer as long as the rest of the world is using the dollar,” Ammous said. He argued that the real solution is to stop printing “fake money” and move to a hard store of value, naming Bitcoin or gold as examples. “Another way to solve this problem would be for the world to move to a hard money standard and stop using America’s shitcoin, and give Trump the trade surpluses he thinks he wants.” Magazine: Bitcoin heading to $70K soon?

According to the latest data from Yahoo Finance, Nasdaq futures have experienced a significant stock market decline , dropping by 2.44% to $16,823.75 in the last 24 hours. This sharp downturn raises critical questions about the broader market volatility and its potential ripple effects across various asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Is this just a minor dip, or a sign of deeper economic concerns? Let’s delve into what this stock market decline could mean for your investments and the overall financial landscape. Why Are Nasdaq Futures Plummeting? Understanding the Stock Market Decline The 2.44% drop in Nasdaq futures is not just a number; it represents a significant shift in market sentiment. Several factors could be contributing to this stock market decline . These include: Rising Inflation Fears: Persistent inflation continues to be a major concern. Recent economic data might be suggesting that inflation is proving more stubborn than initially anticipated, leading investors to anticipate more aggressive interest rate hikes from central banks. Geopolitical Uncertainty: Global events and geopolitical tensions always add a layer of unpredictability to the markets. Any escalation in these situations can trigger sell-offs as investors seek safer havens. Earnings Season Jitters: As earnings season progresses, investors are closely scrutinizing company reports and forward guidance. Disappointing earnings or cautious outlooks from major tech companies (which heavily influence the Nasdaq) can lead to downward pressure on futures. Profit Taking: After periods of gains, some investors may be taking profits off the table, contributing to the downward momentum. Decoding Market Volatility: What Does a 2.44% Nasdaq Futures Drop Really Mean? A 2.44% drop in Nasdaq futures is undeniably significant. To put it into perspective, consider these points regarding market volatility : Increased Investor Anxiety: Such a sharp decline often reflects heightened anxiety among investors. It suggests a shift from a bullish to a more cautious or even bearish outlook, at least in the short term. Potential for Further Downside: Large drops can sometimes trigger a snowball effect. Fear can lead to more selling, potentially exacerbating the stock market decline . Impact on Crypto: The cryptocurrency market, while often touted as being uncorrelated, has shown increasing correlation with traditional markets, particularly the tech-heavy Nasdaq. A significant drop in Nasdaq futures can often foreshadow similar movements in crypto. Trading Opportunities: For savvy traders, increased market volatility can also present opportunities. However, it’s crucial to approach such periods with caution and robust risk management strategies. Investment Risk Assessment: Navigating the Current Economic Downturn In times of market volatility and potential economic downturn , assessing investment risk becomes paramount. Here’s what investors should consider: Risk Factor Potential Impact Actionable Insight High Inflation Erosion of purchasing power, reduced corporate profits, increased cost of borrowing. Review portfolio for inflation-resistant assets, consider hedging strategies. Interest Rate Hikes Increased borrowing costs, potential slowdown in economic growth, pressure on asset valuations. Assess debt levels, diversify investments, consider fixed-income adjustments. Geopolitical Instability Supply chain disruptions, increased energy prices, market uncertainty. Monitor global events, diversify geographically, maintain a long-term perspective. Earnings Misses Stock price declines, reduced investor confidence, potential sector-specific downturns. Analyze company fundamentals, focus on quality stocks, be prepared for volatility. Is This the Start of an Economic Downturn? What Investors Need to Watch While a single day’s stock market decline doesn’t definitively signal an economic downturn , it’s a crucial signal that demands attention. To gauge whether this is a temporary blip or a more prolonged trend, investors should closely monitor: Economic Indicators: Keep an eye on key economic data releases such as inflation reports, GDP growth, employment figures, and consumer confidence indices. These provide clues about the overall health of the economy. Central Bank Actions: Pay close attention to statements and policy decisions from central banks like the Federal Reserve. Their actions regarding interest rates and monetary policy will significantly influence market direction. Corporate Earnings: Analyze earnings reports and future guidance from major companies across different sectors. Weak earnings and pessimistic outlooks can be leading indicators of a potential economic downturn . Market Sentiment: Track market sentiment through various indicators like the VIX (volatility index) and investor surveys. High volatility and negative sentiment can suggest increased investment risk and potential for further declines. Navigating the Uncertainty: Actionable Insights for Crypto and Traditional Investors In these uncertain times, both crypto and traditional investors need to be proactive and strategic. Here are some actionable insights: Diversify Your Portfolio: Diversification remains a cornerstone of risk management. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Spread your investments across different asset classes to mitigate the impact of market volatility in any single sector. Review Your Risk Tolerance: Market downturns are a good time to reassess your risk tolerance. Are you comfortable with the level of risk in your current portfolio? Adjust your asset allocation accordingly. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news and economic developments. Reliable financial news sources and analysis can help you make informed decisions. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging: For long-term investors, market dips can be opportunities to buy assets at lower prices using a dollar-cost averaging strategy. Don’t Panic Sell: Emotional decisions can be detrimental in investing. Avoid panic selling during downturns. Instead, focus on your long-term investment strategy and make rational, informed choices. Conclusion: Staying Vigilant in the Face of Market Volatility The 2.44% drop in Nasdaq futures serves as a stark reminder of the inherent market volatility and investment risk present in today’s financial landscape. While it’s not necessarily a definitive predictor of a prolonged economic downturn , it’s a significant event that warrants careful observation. For crypto investors, the interconnectedness of markets means these traditional market signals cannot be ignored. Staying informed, understanding the underlying factors driving market movements, and adopting a prudent investment strategy are crucial for navigating these uncertain times and safeguarding your financial future. The key is to remain vigilant, adaptable, and prepared for potential further fluctuations in both traditional and cryptocurrency markets.

The wild world of decentralized finance (DeFi) has just delivered another jolt of drama. News has broken about a significant Ethereum sell-off linked to a project with a rather prominent name attached – World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a DeFi venture reportedly associated with the Trump family. Buckle up as we dive into the details of this developing story and what it could mean for the broader crypto landscape. Sudden Ethereum Sell-off Sparks Market Speculation Just moments ago, blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain, armed with data from Arkham, sent ripples through the crypto community with a tweet heard ’round the digital world. They reported a massive Ethereum sell-off originating from a wallet suspected to be linked to World Liberty Financial (WLFI). The numbers are staggering: 5,471 ETH dumped: In a single swift move, the wallet offloaded a hefty 5,471 Ethereum tokens. $8.01 Million Value: This Ethereum sell-off translated to a cool $8.01 million at the time of the transaction. Fire-Sale Price: The ETH was sold at a rate of $1,465 per token. Timing is Everything: This major dump occurred just an hour before the news broke, suggesting a potentially rapid decision. This Ethereum sell-off immediately raises eyebrows and prompts a crucial question: Why now? Was this a strategic move to cut losses, or is there more to this unfolding saga? WLFI’s DeFi Project: A Deep Dive into the Numbers To truly grasp the magnitude of this crypto market loss and the potential implications for WLFI, let’s rewind and examine their initial investment strategy. According to the same reports, WLFI had previously made a significant bet on Ethereum: Massive ETH Purchase: WLFI reportedly acquired a whopping 67,498 ETH. $210 Million Investment: This accumulation cost them a substantial $210 million. High Entry Point: Their average purchase price per ETH was a hefty $3,259. Now, compare this initial investment with the recent Ethereum sell-off price of $1,465. The stark difference reveals a grim reality for WLFI. The Cold Hard Facts: Calculating the Crypto Market Loss Let’s break down the numbers to fully understand the extent of the crypto market loss faced by WLFI: Metric Value Original ETH Purchase 67,498 ETH Total Investment $210 Million Average Purchase Price $3,259 per ETH ETH Sold Recently 5,471 ETH Selling Price $1,465 per ETH Value of ETH Sold $8.01 Million Potential Total Loss (Unrealized) $125 Million As you can see, based on these figures, WLFI is currently sitting on a staggering potential loss of $125 million on their Ethereum holdings. This significant crypto market loss raises serious questions about the future viability of the DeFi project and the investment strategies employed. Trump Family Crypto Link: What’s the Connection to WLFI? The mention of the “Trump family” in connection with WLFI adds another layer of intrigue to this DeFi project saga. While direct involvement remains to be officially confirmed, the reports citing sources linking the project to the Trump family name are circulating widely. This association, whether direct or indirect, inevitably draws increased scrutiny and media attention to WLFI’s operations, especially in the wake of this substantial Ethereum sell-off and subsequent crypto market loss . The potential connection to such a high-profile family amplifies the stakes. Any missteps or financial difficulties within the DeFi project are likely to be magnified in the public eye, potentially impacting not only WLFI but also perceptions of celebrity-endorsed or associated crypto ventures. Analyzing the DeFi Project’s Future: Challenges and Uncertainties The massive Ethereum sell-off and the reported $125 million paper loss paint a concerning picture for the future of the WLFI DeFi project . Several challenges and uncertainties now loom large: Investor Confidence: Such a significant and public crypto market loss can severely erode investor confidence. Will investors continue to back WLFI, or will this trigger further withdrawals and instability? Project Viability: A $125 million loss is a substantial blow to any project. Does WLFI have sufficient reserves to weather this storm and continue its operations? The long-term viability of the DeFi project is now in question. Regulatory Scrutiny: Given the high-profile association and the scale of the reported losses, WLFI may attract increased regulatory attention. The already complex and evolving regulatory landscape for DeFi could pose further hurdles. Market Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is notoriously volatile.

The crypto market is a constantly evolving landscape, and understanding its cyclical nature is key to navigating its thrilling ups and downs. Right now, a crucial indicator is flashing: the Altcoin Season Index . According to CoinMarketCap (CMC), this index has registered a low score of 16 as of April 9th, 00:45 UTC, holding steady from the previous day. This number isn’t just a random figure; it’s a powerful signal pointing towards one dominant market phase – Bitcoin Season . Let’s dive deep into what this means for you and the broader crypto ecosystem. Unveiling the Mystery: What is the Altcoin Season Index? Imagine a barometer for the crypto market, but instead of measuring atmospheric pressure, it measures the comparative strength of altcoins against Bitcoin. That’s essentially what the Altcoin Season Index is. Tracked diligently by CoinMarketCap, this metric provides valuable insights into whether altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin or vice versa. It’s a crucial tool for traders and investors looking to understand the prevailing market sentiment and potentially adjust their strategies. Here’s a breakdown of how this fascinating index works: Scope: The index considers the top 100 cryptocurrencies listed on CoinMarketCap. This excludes stablecoins, which are designed to maintain a stable value, and wrapped tokens, which represent other cryptocurrencies on different blockchains. This focused approach ensures the index accurately reflects the performance of true altcoins relative to Bitcoin. Timeframe: It analyzes the price performance of these top 100 coins over the past 90 days. This 90-day window provides a medium-term perspective, smoothing out short-term volatility and revealing more significant market trends. The Core Calculation: The index checks how many of these top 100 coins have outperformed Bitcoin in terms of price percentage gain over the last 90 days. Season Thresholds: This is where it gets interesting. The index uses a critical threshold of 75% to differentiate between market seasons: Altcoin Season: To officially declare an Altcoin Season, at least 75% of the top 100 coins must have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. This signifies a period where altcoins, as a whole, are experiencing stronger growth momentum compared to Bitcoin. Bitcoin Season: Conversely, Bitcoin Season is declared when 25% or fewer of the top 100 coins manage to outperform Bitcoin during the same 90-day period. This indicates Bitcoin’s dominance and relatively stronger performance compared to the majority of altcoins. Index Score: The Altcoin Season Index score ranges from 1 to 100. A higher score indicates a stronger Altcoin Season, while a lower score points towards Bitcoin Season. A score of 16, as we are currently seeing, firmly places us in Bitcoin territory. Bitcoin Season vs. Altcoin Season: Understanding the Dynamics So, what exactly does it mean when the market is in Bitcoin Season versus Altcoin Season ? Understanding the nuances of these phases is crucial for making informed decisions in the volatile crypto market. Bitcoin Season: The Reign of the King During Bitcoin Season , Bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, takes center stage. It tends to outperform most altcoins, often leading market rallies and corrections. Here’s what characterizes Bitcoin Season: Bitcoin Dominance: Bitcoin’s market capitalization dominance tends to increase as investors flock to the relative safety and established reputation of Bitcoin. Risk-Off Sentiment: Bitcoin Season often coincides with periods of market uncertainty or risk-off sentiment. Investors may rotate profits from riskier altcoins back into Bitcoin as a perceived safe haven within the crypto space. Capital Consolidation: Capital tends to consolidate in Bitcoin, leading to potentially slower growth or even corrections in the altcoin market. Focus on Fundamentals: During Bitcoin Season, the market often focuses on Bitcoin’s fundamental strengths, such as its scarcity, decentralization, and store of value narrative. Altcoin Season: The Rise of the Alternatives In contrast, Altcoin Season is when the spotlight shifts to alternative cryptocurrencies. Altcoins, ranging from Ethereum to smaller, emerging projects, experience significant growth and investor interest. Key features of Altcoin Season include: Altcoin Outperformance: As the name suggests, altcoins generally outperform Bitcoin, often by significant margins. This is driven by various factors, including new technological developments, increased adoption of specific altcoin ecosystems, and shifts in market narratives. Risk-On Sentiment: Altcoin Season often occurs during periods of market exuberance and risk-on sentiment. Investors are more willing to explore higher-risk, higher-reward altcoins in search of exponential gains. Capital Rotation: Profits from Bitcoin may rotate into altcoins, fueling their price surges. This can be triggered by Bitcoin reaching a perceived peak or investors seeking higher percentage gains than Bitcoin might offer at that stage. Narrative and Hype Cycles: Altcoin Season can be heavily influenced by emerging narratives and hype cycles around specific sectors within the crypto space, such as DeFi, NFTs, or Layer-2 solutions. Current Crypto Market Analysis: Why Bitcoin Season Now? With the Altcoin Season Index stubbornly low at 16, the data clearly indicates we are currently navigating a Bitcoin Season . But what factors are contributing to this market phase? Several elements could be at play: Macroeconomic Uncertainty: Global economic conditions, including inflation concerns, interest rate hikes, and geopolitical instability, often drive investors towards perceived safe-haven assets. In the crypto world, Bitcoin, despite its volatility, is often viewed as a more established and less risky asset compared to many altcoins, especially during turbulent times. Bitcoin ETF Momentum: The launch and increasing adoption of Bitcoin ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) in various markets have provided traditional investors with easier access to Bitcoin. This influx of institutional and retail capital into Bitcoin can strengthen its dominance and contribute to Bitcoin Season. Altcoin Market Correction: After periods of significant altcoin rallies, a natural correction phase often ensues. Investors may take profits on altcoins and rotate back into Bitcoin, leading to a period of Bitcoin outperformance. Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased regulatory scrutiny in the crypto space can sometimes disproportionately affect altcoins, particularly those that are perceived as securities or operating in less regulated areas. This uncertainty can drive investors towards the relative regulatory clarity surrounding Bitcoin. Navigating Bitcoin Season: Opportunities and Strategies Bitcoin Season doesn’t necessarily mean the end of opportunities in the crypto market. In fact, it presents unique scenarios for savvy investors. Here are some potential strategies to consider during Bitcoin’s reign: Focus on Bitcoin Accumulation: Bitcoin Season can be an opportune time to accumulate more Bitcoin. If you believe in Bitcoin’s long-term potential, periods of Bitcoin dominance can offer relatively attractive entry points or opportunities to dollar-cost average into Bitcoin. Selective Altcoin Investing: While the broad market may be in Bitcoin Season, certain altcoins with strong fundamentals, innovative technologies, or unique use cases may still present investment opportunities. Conduct thorough research and identify altcoins that can potentially weather the Bitcoin Season and thrive in the long run. Look for projects with strong developer communities, real-world adoption, and solid tokenomics. Monitor Altcoin Season Index for Shifts: Keep a close eye on the Altcoin Season Index . A gradual increase in the index score could signal a potential shift towards Altcoin Season. Be prepared to adjust your portfolio accordingly when indicators suggest a change in market dynamics. Diversification and Risk Management: Regardless of the prevailing market season, diversification remains crucial. Maintain a balanced portfolio that includes Bitcoin, select altcoins, and potentially other asset classes. Implement robust risk management strategies, such as setting stop-loss orders and managing position sizes, to protect your capital in the volatile crypto market. Looking Ahead: Will Altcoin Season Return? The cyclical nature of the crypto market suggests that Bitcoin Season , like all market phases, is unlikely to last forever. The question isn’t *if* Altcoin Season will return, but *when*. Several factors could potentially trigger a shift back towards altcoin dominance: Innovation and New Narratives: Breakthrough innovations in the altcoin space, such as advancements in DeFi, NFTs, Metaverse technologies, or new blockchain solutions, can reignite investor interest and trigger a surge in altcoin valuations. The emergence of compelling new narratives can also shift market focus away from Bitcoin and towards specific altcoin sectors. Ethereum Ecosystem Developments: Ethereum, as the leading smart contract platform, plays a significant role in the altcoin market. Successful upgrades like the Merge and ongoing developments in Ethereum scaling solutions can boost confidence in the Ethereum ecosystem and drive renewed interest in Ethereum and related altcoins. Broader Crypto Market Expansion: Continued mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies, increased institutional participation, and favorable regulatory developments can create a more bullish environment for the entire crypto market, including altcoins. As the market matures and diversifies, altcoins may gain a larger share of overall market capitalization. Bitcoin Cycle Dynamics: Historically, Bitcoin has experienced cyclical bull and bear markets. After a period of Bitcoin dominance, capital may naturally rotate back into altcoins as investors seek higher growth potential and diversification. It’s crucial to remember that predicting market movements with certainty is impossible. However, by understanding indicators like the Altcoin Season Index , staying informed about market trends, and adapting your strategies accordingly, you can navigate the crypto landscape with greater confidence and potentially capitalize on opportunities regardless of whether it’s Bitcoin or Altcoin Season. Conclusion: Navigating the Crypto Seasons The Altcoin Season Index serves as a valuable compass in the often-turbulent seas of the crypto market. Currently signaling a Bitcoin Season with a score of 16, it highlights Bitcoin’s present dominance. Understanding the dynamics of Bitcoin and Altcoin Seasons, recognizing the contributing factors, and adapting your investment strategies are essential for navigating these market cycles successfully. While Bitcoin currently holds the reins, the crypto market is ever-evolving, and the winds of change can shift quickly. By staying informed, remaining adaptable, and focusing on long-term fundamentals, you can position yourself to thrive in any crypto season.

According to Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer (CLO), the SEC has dropped its appeal, while Ripple has also decided to drop its cross-appeal. Additionally, Ripple will now only pay a $50 million fine, a significant reduction from the original $125 million penalty proposed earlier. However, despite these claims, the SEC has yet to confirm the settlement, leading to continued uncertainty about the case’s actual status. The SEC’s response has raised more questions than answers, particularly after it filed an opposition to an “emergency request to present decisive evidence” in favor of Ripple. This filing, submitted by a man named Justin W. Keener, is aimed at providing what he claims to be decisive evidence that could help Ripple in its case against the SEC. In the latest developments, the SEC has opposed Keener’s motion for several reasons. According to the SEC, the District Court no longer has jurisdiction over the request, as the case has already moved to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. The SEC also argues that Keener did not follow the proper legal procedures to intervene in the case and that Ripple itself is capable of deciding whether the evidence is useful to its case. The SEC is asking Judge Torres to deny the motion entirely. Attorney Bill Morgan pointed out an interesting detail in the SEC’s opposition filing. The SEC appeared to contradict Ripple’s recent claims of settlement by writing to Judge Torres that the case is still in the appeal process. This leaves the situation unclear—while Ripple insists the case is settled, the SEC maintains that the matter is still under appeal. This odd situation has sparked confusion and left many wondering what the actual status of the case is. Such an odd thing that Ripple say the Appeal and Cross-Appeal is settled but the SEC writes to Judge Torres that the matter is still on appeal. Settled but not quite over. https://t.co/TpNv2DcKoE pic.twitter.com/XFAKJAzUUP — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) April 9, 2025 With these conflicting statements, investors, legal experts, and XRP supporters are calling for clarification from the SEC.

Speaking from Paris Blockchain Week, where the news first broke, Kwok noted that the deal holds transformative potential for Ripple, XRP Ledger, and the broader digital asset ecosystem. “I’ve followed tons of deals in the crypto space, but Ripple’s acquisition of Hidden Road is undoubtedly one of the most significant,” Kwok said on X. “This makes Ripple the first crypto company to own and operate a global, multi-asset prime broker.” The acquisition, reportedly valued at $1.25 billion, allows Ripple to offer full-service trading and clearing solutions that rival those of Wall Street’s most prominent financial institutions, according to Kwok. Hidden Road, which processes over $3 trillion in transactions annually and serves over 300 institutional clients, will now become a central pillar of Ripple’s efforts to bring institutional-grade services to the crypto world. Related News: Binance CEO Talks About Recent Events: How Will Tariffs Affect Cryptocurrencies? “Hidden Road processes over $10 billion in transactions on any given day and over 50 million transactions on traditional finance rails. Now, this will run on the XRP Ledger,” he added. According to Kwok, one of the key benefits of the acquisition is that Hidden Road’s operations will be deeply integrated into Ripple’s ecosystem. All transactions made through Hidden Road will be moved to the XRP Ledger, while Ripple’s native stablecoin, RLUSD, will be used as collateral for the firm’s brokerage services. According to Kwok, this is expected to significantly increase real-world institutional adoption of both XRP Ledger and RLUSD, solidifying Ripple’s position as a leading infrastructure provider in the digital finance space. *This is not investment advice.

The proposal outlines both standard and preferential tax models, signalling a move to align the country’s financial system with global digital asset norms. Shared publicly on Telegram by Commission head Ruslan Magomedov on Tuesday, the proposal suggests a personal income tax rate of 18% and an additional 5% military levy on virtual asset gains. Introduced during wartime, the military levy functions as an additional tax to help fund the country’s defense efforts. Alternatively, the model includes preferential tax rates of 5% and 9% for certain categories. These recommendations draw on international examples and are tailored to fit within Ukraine’s legal framework. “In the digital age, taxation of cryptocurrencies is no longer a hypothesis – it’s a rapidly approaching reality,” Magomedov said. “That’s why the NSSMC has developed a matrix presenting various taxation options for virtual asset transactions – from mining to airdrops.” Ukraine is considering a 5-10% tax on crypto income, with legislation expected by mid-2025. The move looks to bolster state revenue while navigating regulatory hurdles. #CryptoRegulations #CryptoTax #Ukraine https://t.co/MbtXiYCWi3 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) February 28, 2025 Ukraine Looks Abroad for Guidance as It Builds Its Crypto Tax Framework The proposed rules define taxable income either as gross revenue or net income after expenses. Income would generally be recognized when received or when assets are exchanged for fiat currency or non-virtual goods and services. Transactions that involve only virtual assets would not trigger a tax under this model. The matrix references countries with more favorable treatment of crypto activity. Austria and France, for example, do not tax crypto-to-crypto exchanges. Singapore does not levy capital gains taxes on individuals or companies. Malaysia exempts transactions unless they are routine or business-related. Georgia offers full exemptions for individuals on income and capital gains from digital assets. Reports in February indicated that Ukrainian authorities were working on legislation to introduce a 5%-10% tax on crypto by mid-2025, aiming to boost state revenue and support military funding amid the ongoing war with Russia. Ukraine Clarifies VAT Treatment for Crypto Operations Like Mining and Staking The document also provides tax guidance on mining, staking, airdrops and hard forks. Activities like free token supply, token creation, and storing virtual assets would not be subject to VAT. However, rewards or services that involve token modification or crypto payments for goods and services may be taxed. Some of these transactions may qualify for exemptions under Article 135 of the EU VAT Directive. This applies especially if they are considered payment-related services. The Commission noted that this classification may need additional interpretation and legal guidance. Ukraine’s effort to establish a clear tax policy for virtual assets comes at a time of economic strain and heightened interest in digital finance. The Commission has already introduced the matrix to lawmakers and now plans to engage directly with market participants as part of its regulatory development process.

In a bold statement, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently suggested that the dispute has been resolved. Echoing his sentiment, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer revealed that both parties have opted to drop their respective appeals — Ripple will no longer pursue its cross-appeal. The SEC has allegedly withdrawn its challenge. As part of this supposed agreement, Ripple has agreed to pay a $50 million fine — a much lower figure than the $125 million penalty initially on the table. However, despite Ripple’s optimism, the SEC has not yet confirmed the reported resolution . This silence has only deepened speculation and raised concerns about whether the case is truly over. SEC Disputes Ripple’s Settlement Claims The uncertainty intensified when the SEC recently filed a motion opposing an “ emergency request” submitted by Justin W. Keener — an independent party claiming to possess critical evidence that could benefit Ripple. Keener’s filing aimed to introduce this evidence before the court, but the SEC pushed back, urging Judge Analisa Torres to reject the motion outright. Among its arguments, the SEC contended that the district court no longer has jurisdiction, pointing out that the case has moved to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. Furthermore, the agency argued that Keener lacked the legal standing to involve himself in the proceedings and that, as the defendant, Ripple has the discretion to decide whether such evidence is in its favor. Legal Analyst Flags Inconsistencies Attorney Bill Morgan highlighted a discrepancy in the SEC’s filing. While Ripple announced a concluded settlement, the SEC’s statement to Judge Torres claims the appeal process is ongoing, directly contradicting Ripple’s public assertion. This inconsistency raises questions about the case’s status and potential implications for XRP, settlement negotiations, the appeal process, and XRP’s price movement. Such an odd thing that Ripple say the Appeal and Cross-Appeal is settled but the SEC writes to Judge Torres that the matter is still on appeal. Settled but not quite over. https://t.co/TpNv2DcKoE pic.twitter.com/XFAKJAzUUP — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) April 9, 2025 This discrepancy has further fueled uncertainty, prompting legal observers, XRP investors, and the broader crypto community to question who is telling the complete story.

Ripple case remains murky. On the one hand, Ripple has declared the chapter closed, citing the mutual withdrawal of appeals and a reduced fine. On the other hand, the SEC’s recent actions and court statements suggest that litigation — or at least procedural matters — are still active. Now, market participants and stakeholders are demanding transparency. There is increasing demand for the SEC to issue a formal statement clarifying whether the case has reached a definitive conclusion or if the legal wrangling will continue. Until then, the case that has defined crypto regulation in the U.S. for years remains stuck in limbo, despite the supposed light at the end of the tunnel.

43112408,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=147726,1744183315,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Critical Bitcoin Support Level: Chris Burniske Pinpoints Strategic $70K Zone,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/critical-bitcoin-support-level/,"Is the crypto market bracing for another dip? Amidst the ever-dynamic world of digital currencies, seasoned crypto analyst Chris Burniske, formerly a lead at ARK Invest and now with Placeholder VC, has offered a crucial insight for Bitcoin (BTC) investors. His recent analysis suggests a potentially strategic support level for Bitcoin at $70,000, should it retrace from its current position. Let’s delve into what this means for your crypto portfolio and the broader market sentiment. Understanding the Bitcoin Support Level: Burniske’s $70K Insight Burniske’s analysis centers around the idea that if Bitcoin were to fall below $76,000 again, the next significant Bitcoin support level to watch out for is $70,000. But why $70,000? According to Burniske, this level isn’t arbitrary; it’s rooted in Bitcoin’s recent price history and market behavior. Here’s a breakdown: 2021 Bull Market Peak Echo: The $70,000 mark is closely aligned with the peak of the 2021 bull market. Historical peaks often transform into support levels during subsequent market cycles. 2024 Consolidation Range Upper Limit: Between March and October 2024, Bitcoin largely traded within a consolidation range. $70,000 represented the upper boundary of this range. Breaking out of a consolidation range and then retesting its upper limit as support is a common pattern in technical analysis. Strong Support Zone: The confluence of these two factors – the 2021 peak and the 2024 consolidation range – creates a robust support zone around $70,000. This means there’s a higher probability of buyers stepping in at this level to prevent further price declines. While a dip to $70,000 might initially trigger concerns and fuel crypto market analysis suggesting a deeper correction, Burniske presents a different perspective – one of opportunity. He suggests that such a scenario could be viewed as a strategic accumulation phase for savvy investors. Why $70K Could Be a Strategic Accumulation Zone? The idea of “strategic accumulation” might sound counterintuitive when prices are potentially falling. However, in the world of crypto, periods of price retracement can often present opportune moments to build your portfolio. Here’s why Burniske might see a dip to $70,000 as a strategic accumulation opportunity: Buying the Dip Mentality: Experienced crypto investors often look for chances to “buy the dip.” A drop to a well-defined support level like $70,000 can signal a potential bottom or at least a temporary price floor. Long-Term Perspective: Burniske, known for his long-term vision on crypto, likely views short-term price fluctuations as noise in the grander scheme of Bitcoin’s adoption and growth trajectory. Accumulating at support levels aligns with a long-term investment strategy. Reduced Risk at Support: Buying at a recognized support level can potentially reduce risk compared to buying during price rallies. If the support holds, the downside risk is limited. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): A dip to $70,000 could be an ideal point to implement or continue a dollar-cost averaging strategy, gradually building your Bitcoin holdings over time. However, it’s crucial to remember that BTC price prediction and market analysis are not guarantees. While $70,000 represents a strong support level, there’s always a possibility that Bitcoin could fall further. Therefore, any investment decision should be made with careful consideration and risk management.

Often seen as the digital gold and silver, respectively, these two giants command the lion’s share of market attention and investment. But beneath the surface of daily price fluctuations and exciting project launches, a fascinating trend has emerged: Bitcoin’s persistent outperformance against Ethereum on the majority of trading days. Is this a temporary blip or a long-term reality? Let’s dive into the data and uncover the intriguing story behind the Bitcoin dominance narrative. Decoding the Bitcoin vs. Ethereum Performance Puzzle Recent analysis from Cointelegraph, citing analyst James Check, reveals a surprising statistic: since Ethereum’s inception in mid-2015, Bitcoin (BTC) has outperformed Ethereum (ETH) on a staggering 85% of all trading days. This isn’t just a marginal lead; it’s a consistent trend that challenges the narrative of Ethereum as the ultimate ‘crypto 2.0’ poised to overtake Bitcoin. But how can we interpret this data, and what does it mean for investors? Historical Context: When Did Ethereum Shine? It’s not all Bitcoin’s game, all the time. The data highlights specific periods where Ethereum did indeed take the lead. These golden windows for ETH primarily occurred: Mid-2015 to Mid-2017: This era marked the early excitement around Ethereum and its smart contract capabilities. The potential of decentralized applications (dApps) and Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) fueled significant interest and investment in ETH, allowing it to outpace Bitcoin for a considerable stretch. Late 2019 and Early 2020: Brief bursts of stronger Ethereum performance also punctuated the market in late 2019 and early 2020. These periods might be attributed to specific Ethereum network upgrades, DeFi hype starting to build, or shifts in broader market sentiment. However, these periods of Ethereum outperformance have been relatively short-lived compared to Bitcoin’s consistent lead over the long term. This brings us to the crucial metric: the ETH/BTC ratio. The ETH/BTC Ratio: A Five-Year Low The ETH/BTC ratio is a key indicator for understanding the relative strength of Ethereum against Bitcoin. It essentially tells you how much Ethereum is worth in Bitcoin terms. A rising ratio suggests Ethereum is gaining value faster than Bitcoin, and a falling ratio indicates Bitcoin is outperforming. As of April 9th, according to TradingView data, this ratio plummeted to a five-year low of 0.018. This chart visually represents the trend. The declining ETH/BTC ratio underscores the sustained period of Bitcoin’s relative strength. But what factors are driving this trend? Analyzing Cryptocurrency Performance Drivers Several factors can influence the relative cryptocurrency performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Let’s consider some key elements: Bitcoin’s ‘Store of Value’ Narrative: Bitcoin has solidified its position as digital gold, attracting investors seeking a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. In times of market volatility or economic downturns, investors often flock to Bitcoin as a perceived safer haven within the crypto space. Ethereum’s Utility and Complexity: Ethereum’s strength lies in its utility – powering dApps, DeFi, NFTs, and more. However, this complexity also introduces challenges. Network congestion, high gas fees, and the ongoing transition to Ethereum 2.0 can create headwinds for ETH’s price performance. Market Cycles and Sentiment: The broader crypto market trends significantly impact both Bitcoin and Ethereum. During bull markets, both tend to rise, but the magnitude of gains can vary. In bear markets, both typically decline, but the rate of decline and investor sentiment can differ. Technological Developments and Upgrades: Major upgrades or technological advancements in either Bitcoin or Ethereum ecosystems can trigger shifts in investor sentiment and relative performance. For example, Bitcoin’s Taproot upgrade and Ethereum’s ongoing transition to Proof-of-Stake are significant events that can influence market dynamics. Institutional Adoption: Institutional investment flows into Bitcoin have generally been more robust and consistent compared to Ethereum. This institutional demand further strengthens Bitcoin’s position as a leading cryptocurrency. What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors? Understanding the historical performance and the ETH/BTC ratio provides valuable insights for crypto investors. Here are some actionable takeaways: Diversification Remains Key: While Bitcoin has shown consistent outperformance, diversification across different cryptocurrencies, including both BTC and ETH, is still a prudent strategy. Different market cycles may favor different assets. Monitor the ETH/BTC Ratio: Keep an eye on the ETH/BTC ratio as a gauge of relative strength. A sustained reversal in the downward trend could signal a potential shift in market dynamics favoring Ethereum. Stay Informed on Developments: Track technological upgrades, adoption metrics, and regulatory changes impacting both Bitcoin and Ethereum. These factors can significantly influence their future performance. Consider Risk Tolerance: Bitcoin, with its established store of value narrative, might be considered a relatively less risky crypto asset compared to Ethereum, which, while offering immense potential, also faces ongoing development and scaling challenges. Align your investment strategy with your risk appetite. The Future Landscape: Will Ethereum Catch Up? The cryptocurrency landscape is constantly evolving. While historical data points to Bitcoin’s dominance in outperforming Ethereum on most trading days, the future is not set in stone. Ethereum’s transition to ETH 2.0, with its promise of improved scalability and lower fees, could potentially be a game-changer. The growth of the DeFi and NFT sectors, largely built on Ethereum, also presents significant opportunities for ETH to regain momentum. However, Bitcoin’s first-mover advantage, strong network effects, and established institutional adoption are formidable strengths. The competition between these two crypto titans will undoubtedly continue to shape the market for years to come. Conclusion: Navigating the Bitcoin and Ethereum Dynamic The data is clear: Bitcoin has historically outperformed Ethereum on the vast majority of trading days since ETH’s launch. The ETH/BTC ratio’s five-year low further underscores this trend. While Ethereum has had its moments of glory, Bitcoin’s resilience and ‘digital gold’ narrative have generally prevailed. For crypto investors, understanding this dynamic is crucial for informed decision-making. Diversification, monitoring key metrics like the ETH/BTC ratio, and staying abreast of technological and market developments are essential strategies for navigating the ever-changing world of cryptocurrencies. The shocking consistency of Bitcoin’s outperformance serves as a powerful reminder of the nuanced and often unpredictable nature of the crypto market.

As fear dominated the sector, Binance CEO Richard Teng weighed in on the escalating trade tensions and their effect on the cryptocurrency market. While acknowledging the prevailing downtrends, Teng believes long-term trends might favor digital assets and cement Bitcoin’s status as a store of wealth. Commenting on the current market outlook, Binance’s CEO stated: This environment could also accelerate interest in crypto as a non-sovereign store of value. Many long-term holders view Bitcoin and other digital assets as resilient during economic stress and shifting policy dynamics. His remarks coincided with PepeX ’s flourishing presale, raising over $1.3 million since its March 24, 2025 debut.

Some crypto enthusiasts have exited the space, while others have adopted the wait-and-watch approach to see what is next for growth, trade, and policy. Richard Teng trusts Trump tariffs will have two-sided impacts on digital assets. While the trade tension triggers pessimism as macroeconomic woes dampen sentiments, the CEO believes short-term volatility could create a lucrative environment for Bitcoin and other cryptos. Teng’s remarks match most crypto proponents, including Strategy’s Michael Saylor, who emphasizes Bitcoin’s ability to disrupt mainstream financial protocols during economic tensions. These conclusions position crypto as a dominant force in the global financial space. Savvy experts focus on long-term goals despite the current turmoil. That creates a perfect environment for crypto projects looking to redefine the digital assets sector, including the viral PepeX. PepeX presale defies the odds Cryptocurrencies display bearishness as Trump’s trade war catalyzed risk-off sentiments. However, PepeX thrives in the choppy markets, with over $1.3 million raised about two weeks since opening the ICO. PepeX’s utility seems to attract experienced investors as hype-driven projects fail to keep pace. The new project leverages AI to revolutionize the meme crypto space by rivaling struggling alternatives like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and PEPE. Notably, PepeX uses AI to make tokenization smooth. Also, its innovative Launchpad allows individuals to create their favorite tokens within five minutes while prioritizing fairness and transparency.

43112602,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=147699,1744183671,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Decoding the Impactful U.S. Reciprocal Tariff Policy: A Crypto Investor’s Guide,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-reciprocal-tariff-policy-impact/,"In an era where global economics and digital assets are increasingly intertwined, understanding shifts in international trade policies becomes crucial for cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors. The recent implementation of the U.S. reciprocal tariff policy , as reported by CNBC, marks a significant development in the global economic landscape. But what does this policy truly entail, and how might it ripple through the world of crypto? Let’s decode this impactful policy and explore its potential implications. Understanding the U.S. Reciprocal Tariff Policy The term “ reciprocal tariff policy ” might sound complex, but at its core, it’s about fairness and balance in international trade. Essentially, it allows the United States to impose tariffs on goods from a country that has already imposed tariffs on U.S. goods. It’s a tit-for-tat approach designed to encourage other nations to lower their trade barriers and create a more level playing field. Think of it as a negotiation tactic on a global scale, where tariffs become the bargaining chips. Here’s a breakdown of the key aspects: Action-Reaction Framework: The policy is fundamentally reactive. It’s triggered when another country imposes tariffs or other trade restrictions that harm U.S. exports. Aim for Fairness: The primary goal is to achieve ‘reciprocity’ – if country X charges a 10% tariff on U.S. goods, the U.S. might respond by charging a similar tariff on goods from country X. Negotiating Tool: Reciprocal tariffs are intended to be more than just punitive measures. They are designed to incentivize trading partners to negotiate and remove unfair trade practices. Economic Leverage: By wielding the power of tariffs, the U.S. aims to exert economic pressure to open up foreign markets and ensure fairer trade conditions for American businesses. Benefits of the Reciprocal Tariff Policy Proponents of the reciprocal tariff policy argue that it offers several potential benefits, both for the U.S. economy and potentially for the global trade environment in the long run. Let’s explore some of these advantages: Leveling the Playing Field: One of the most cited benefits is the creation of a fairer trade environment. When countries face reciprocal tariffs, they may be more inclined to reduce their own tariffs, leading to a more balanced global market. Protecting Domestic Industries: Reciprocal tariffs can act as a shield for domestic industries that are unfairly targeted by foreign tariffs. This protection can help maintain jobs and encourage local production. Boosting U.S. Exports: By pushing trading partners to lower their tariffs, the policy could ultimately lead to increased U.S. exports as American goods become more competitive in foreign markets. Strengthening Negotiating Position: The threat of reciprocal tariffs enhances the U.S.’s negotiating power in trade discussions. It provides leverage to push for more favorable trade agreements. Potential for Reduced Global Tariffs: In the ideal scenario, the policy could trigger a domino effect, where countries progressively lower tariffs to avoid reciprocal actions, ultimately leading to lower global tariffs overall. Challenges and Potential Drawbacks While the reciprocal tariff policy aims for positive outcomes, it’s not without its challenges and potential downsides. It’s crucial to consider these aspects to have a balanced perspective: Risk of Trade Wars: The most significant risk is escalation. Reciprocal tariffs can easily spiral into trade wars, where countries continuously retaliate with higher and higher tariffs, harming global trade and economic growth. Impact on Consumers: Tariffs are essentially taxes on imported goods. These costs can be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices for everyday products, potentially leading to inflation. Disruptions to Supply Chains: Tariffs can disrupt established global supply chains, forcing businesses to find new sources or adjust production, which can be costly and inefficient. Negative Impact on Certain Industries: While some domestic industries might benefit, others that rely on imported components or export to countries facing reciprocal tariffs could be negatively impacted. Global Economic Uncertainty: Increased trade tensions and tariff disputes can create uncertainty in the global economy, making businesses hesitant to invest and potentially slowing down economic growth. Examples of Reciprocal Tariff Policy in Action To better understand how the reciprocal tariff policy works in practice, let’s consider some hypothetical examples: Example 1: Agricultural Goods Imagine Country A imposes a 20% tariff on U.S. agricultural products. In response, under the reciprocal tariff policy, the U.S. could impose a 20% tariff on agricultural goods imported from Country A. This action is designed to pressure Country A to reconsider its tariff on U.S. agricultural exports. Example 2: Technology Sector Suppose Country B implements regulations that unfairly discriminate against U.S. technology companies. The U.S. could retaliate by imposing tariffs on specific technology products imported from Country B, aiming to address the discriminatory practices and protect its tech industry. Example 3: Automotive Industry If Country C imposes high tariffs on imported automobiles, making it difficult for U.S. car manufacturers to compete, the U.S. could respond with reciprocal tariffs on automobiles or auto parts from Country C. This aims to encourage fairer access to Country C’s automotive market. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Now, how does all of this relate to the cryptocurrency world? While the reciprocal tariff policy is not directly targeted at crypto, it operates within the broader global economic framework that significantly influences digital assets. Here are some actionable insights for crypto investors: Monitor Global Economic News: Stay informed about developments in international trade and economic policies. Events like the implementation of reciprocal tariffs can signal shifts in global economic sentiment, which can indirectly impact crypto markets. Assess Risk Sentiment: Trade disputes and tariffs can increase economic uncertainty and risk aversion. In such environments, investors might shift away from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies, at least temporarily. Conversely, in times of economic stability fostered by fair trade, risk appetite may increase. Consider Geopolitical Impacts: Pay attention to the geopolitical implications of trade policies. Increased tensions between major economies due to tariff disputes can create market volatility, affecting both traditional and crypto assets. Diversify Investments: In times of economic uncertainty driven by trade policies, diversification becomes even more crucial. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Spread your investments across different asset classes, including crypto, but also consider traditional markets and asset types. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that trade policies and their impacts are often cyclical. While short-term volatility might arise from tariff implementations, long-term trends in technology and adoption are likely to be more significant drivers for the crypto market. The Broader Economic Impact and Crypto The economic impact of the U.S. reciprocal tariff policy extends beyond specific industries and countries. It contributes to the overall global economic climate. A world characterized by escalating trade tensions and tariff wars can lead to: Slower Global Growth: Reduced trade flows and increased uncertainty can dampen global economic growth, affecting all markets, including crypto. Currency Fluctuations: Trade imbalances and tariff disputes can lead to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which can indirectly influence the value of cryptocurrencies, especially when paired against fiat currencies. Supply Chain Restructuring: Businesses may need to restructure their supply chains to mitigate tariff risks, which can have broader economic consequences and potentially impact various sectors, including those related to technology and innovation that are relevant to the crypto space. Conclusion: Navigating the New Trade Landscape The U.S. reciprocal tariff policy is a significant tool in the arsenal of trade policy, aimed at fostering fairer international trade practices. While it holds the promise of leveling the playing field and protecting domestic industries, it also carries risks of trade wars and economic disruptions. For cryptocurrency investors, understanding these broader economic shifts is paramount.

A newly uncovered malware campaign is turning SourceForge’s infrastructure into a launchpad for infection, leveraging the platform’s developer-friendly tools to trick users into downloading malicious crypto software. According to researchers at Kaspersky, the scheme specifically targets crypto users by disguising malware as office-related downloads — complete with bloated installers, password-protected archives, and layers of obfuscation that eventually deliver a crypto miner and a ClipBanker to hijack crypto transactions. In a blog post on Tuesday, April 8, researchers said the attackers set up a fake project on SourceForge called “officepackage,” made to look like Microsoft Office add-ins copied from GitHub. While the project page itself might look normal, the real trap was its auto-generated subdomain “officepackage.sourceforge.io,” the researchers noted. Search engines like Russia ‘s Yandex picked it up, and when users visited the page, they saw a fake list of office apps with download buttons that actually started the malware infection.

But once unzipped, it expands into a bloated 700MB installer. When launched, the installer uses hidden scripts to grab more files from GitHub, eventually unpacking malware that checks for antivirus tools before running. If no threats are detected, it installs tools like AutoIt and Netcat — one script sends system info to a Telegram bot, while another ensures the crypto-mining malware stays on the system, the researchers say. Kaspersky says 90% of affected users appear to be in Russia, with over 4,600 hits between January and March. While the campaign primarily seeks to steal crypto funds, researchers warn that infected machines may also be sold to other threat actors.

43112895,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=707394,1744183800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/43112895.jpeg,Timeline for Pepe Coin (PEPE) to Overtake Dogecoin (DOGE) Market Cap As Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Threatens A 12800% Breakout,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/timeline-for-pepe-coin-pepe-to-overtake-dogecoin-doge-market-cap-as-mutuum-finance-mutm-threatens-a-12800-breakout/,"Pepe Coin (PEPE) is showing the first signs of a bullish reversal and giving people something to cheer about. A whale recently shifted 492 billion Pepe Coin (PEPE) ($3.74 million) from Binance, suggesting the potential of long-term holding. Yet, well over 63% of holders are in a loss, which poses a potential Pepe Coin (PEPE) selling pressure. But technical charts show something bigger: an inverted head-and-shoulders formation — a classic bullish signal. In a radical departure from the industry direction, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is just starting to make its mark, with each lender generating undulating volumes of buy-side pressure, creating an unceasing upward pressure on price across their trading screens. Now in Phase 4 of its presale, the price of MUTM has reached $0.025, with $6.5 million raised and 8,100 holders onboarded. The third stage of investment comes at a 20% increase to $0.03, which will give early investors an immediate 20% profit. MUTM launch price of $0.06 ensures a 140% ROI. According to post-launch predictions, a jump to $3.50 would represent a colossal 12,800% ROI for early supporters. Pepe Coin (PEPE) Path to Dominance Whale activity on Pepe Coin (PEPE) suggests confidence is building, though its dependence on meme-driven hype remains a hurdle. Thanks to first-mover advantage and celebrity endorsements, Dogecoin (DOGE) has a $20 billion market cap: far beyond Pepe Coin (PEPE) $2.5 billion. Pepe Coin (PEPE) needs to capitalize on its deflationary tokenomics and widen use cases for it to take over Dogecoin (DOGE). Should Pepe Coin (PEPE) add to gains above the neckline at $0.00000637, a rally to retest $0.00001146 could be underway. For Pepe Coin (PEPE) overtake Dogecoin (DOGE) in market cap, whale efforts must be consistent and meme coin capacity must be wider. Analysts believe this will happen in less than three years, particularly with greater utility of Pepe Coin (PEPE) beyond speculation. And that demand, if Pepe Coin (PEPE) were to get into DeFi or NFT platforms, could have it closing the gap by as early as 2027. The Ongoing Challenges Facing Dogecoin Dogecoin (DOGE) inflationary supply and absence of utility leave it open to the risk. Although tweets by Elon Musk can raise its price intermittently, Dogecoin (DOGE) has neither the structured tokenomics of a project such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM). In the absence of significant updates, Dogecoin (DOGE) could fade in the face of PEPE and tokens with use cases. The Presale Hype Behind Mutuum Finance Phase 4 is live over at Mutuum Finance (MUTM) due to investor demand. The project’s lending protocol and mtTokens — interest-bearing deposit receipts — bring real-world utility that is lacking in meme coins. This will improve investor trust with an upcoming Certik audit. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) buy-and-distribute mechanism guarantees a sustainable demand, and the platform revenue is channeled back into a buy-back for Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Early Mutuum Finance (MUTM) investors can benefit substantially, particularly as the next presale stage causes a 20% price rise. Why Waiting Could Cost You Investors have until the clock stops on Phase 5, where the price goes to $0.03, to lock in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) $0.025. The window for maximum gains is closing with a post-launch target of $3.50. While PEPE and DOGE fight for meme royalty, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides a real, high-yield alternative. Get your next seat—before the next wave. The smart contract audit of Mutuum Finance is coming to an end, and a report will be published via all official channels very soon.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-exchange-continues-to-delists-7-more-altcoin-trading-pairs-delisted-from-spot-trading-here-are-the-details/,"Binance has announced that it will remove seven spot trading pairs from its platform on April 11, 2025, as part of its regular review process aimed at maintaining a high-quality trading environment. The exchange cited low liquidity and trading volume in its latest market review. Binance to Delisting Seven Spot Trading Pairs on April 11 According to the exchange's notification, the delisting will take place at 06:00 on April 11 and will affect trading pairs that exhibit low liquidity and trading volume. Trading Pairs to be Removed The following spot trading pairs will be delisted: ACT/BRL ALPHA/BTC BLUR/BTC CELR/BTC PENGU/BNB POND/BTC RUNE/BNB Binance clarified that these particular trading pairs will be removed, but the underlying tokens will not be deleted from the platform. Users will still be able to trade the affected assets via other existing trading pairs on Binance Spot. Impact on Trading Bots In addition, Binance will also be terminating its Spot Trading Bot services for the affected pairs at the same time as the delisting. The exchange strongly advised users to update or cancel all active trading bots associated with these pairs to avoid potential losses. Binance periodically reviews all listed trading pairs to ensure a robust and efficient market for its users. Factors that influence the decision to delist trading pairs typically include poor liquidity, low trading activity, and overall market performance. This latest move follows Binance’s broader efforts to maintain transparency and protect its user base in the increasingly competitive crypto exchange landscape. *This is not investment advice.

Analysts Highlight Key Reversal Zone In Play,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-buy-signal-confirmed-analysts-highlight-key-reversal-zone-in-play/,"In an X post shared earlier today, crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted that Bitcoin (BTC) is flashing a buy signal. Another analyst, Titan Of Crypto, highlighted that BTC is currently trading in a reversal zone – suggesting that the leading cryptocurrency may soon experience a shift in price momentum. Bitcoin Flashes Buy Signal Amid Market Pullback Compared to the price action seen last year, Q1 2025 has been relatively sluggish for digital assets. On a year-to-date (YTD) basis, BTC is down nearly 30%, dropping from around $97,600 on January 1 to approximately $78,000 at the time of writing. Related Reading: Shifting Sentiment? Short-Term Bitcoin Holders Stay Put Despite Losses Following yesterday’s tariff-induced crypto market pullback – which wiped over $140 billion from the total crypto market cap – BTC is now beginning to show early signs of strength. Martinez emphasized that Bitcoin is flashing a weekly TD Sequential buy signal. For the uninitiated, the weekly TD Sequential buy signal is a technical indicator that suggests a potential trend reversal or buying opportunity after a prolonged downtrend. It typically appears when a specific 9-count pattern completes, signalling that selling pressure may be exhausted and a price rebound could be near. Meanwhile, fellow crypto analyst Titan Of Crypto pointed out that BTC is trading within a potential reversal zone. He noted that as long as BTC remains above the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level, the broader uptrend would remain intact. Additionally, Titan highlighted that BTC’s Fair Value Gap (FVG) at $80,000 has now been filled – a development that further boosts the case for a potential trend reversal or significant price action at current levels. To explain, an FVG is a price imbalance on a chart, often created by a strong move in one direction, where little to no trading occurred. It indicates a potential area where price may return to “fill the gap” before continuing its trend. Recent BTC Price Drop Not Out Of The Ordinary Another crypto analyst, Master Of Crypto, remarked that although the recent BTC price decline may have alarmed some investors, it’s well within the bounds of historical norms. The analyst pointed out that BTC is currently trading about 26.6% below its all-time high (ATH) of $109,500. Related Reading: Analyst Identifies Key Bitcoin Demand Zone For ‘Substantial Gains’ – Details However, this decline is still less severe than previous market cycle drawdowns, such as 83% in 2018 and 73% in 2022. The analyst added that besides the price pullback, BTC’s weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) has also been trending down for five weeks. That said, technical indicators suggest that it may take more time before BTC sees a meaningful shift in price momentum. For instance, the top cryptocurrency recently flashed a death cross, a bearish pattern that could signal further short-term downside. At press time, BTC trades at $78,543, down 0.3% in the past 24 hours.

Here’s how,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-says-xrp-will-come-in-and-save-the-world-heres-how/,"Crypto commentator X Remi Relief X has posted a detailed message on X, summarizing his eight years of research and insight regarding XRP and the broader financial system. In a post termed as a response to growing concerns over market instability, tariffs, and the performance of assets such as DOGE, Remi claims that recent developments are part of what he calls a “controlled demolition” of the current financial order. According to Remi, XRP is positioned to take on a major role in what he describes as a forthcoming new financial structure. He states directly, “XRP will come in and save the world,” urging his audience to re-read and reflect on the statement. He characterizes this message as a concise version of the extensive analysis he has been undertaking since 2017. MY 8 Years of XRP INFORMATION IN 8 SECONDS Many people are asking me what’s going on with the markets? Why are we crashing? Why the tariffs? Why DOGE? It’s ALL a controlled demolition of the old system. XRP will come in and save the world. Please re-read and understand what… — X Remi Relief X (@RemiReliefX) April 6, 2025 Claims of Delays and Strategic Interference Remi asserts that the transformation was initially planned during President Trump’s first term but was delayed due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the outcome of the 2020 election. He alleges that “the powers that be were not ready,” implying that the pandemic was released deliberately and that the election outcome was manipulated to slow down the intended implementation of a new financial system involving Ripple and XRP. Remi addresses the 2020 lawsuit the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed against Ripple in his message. He claims that the action was not simply a regulatory move but a deliberate effort to stall Ripple’s progress while allowing the company to be vetted for future alignment with government-level operations. He asserts that this process has now concluded, stating, “The legacy system has now accepted Ripple/XRP will rule the new financial system,” and links its emergence with future efforts led by President Trump and Elon Musk. Allegations of Musk’s Early XRP Involvement Remi also claims that Elon Musk has been involved with XRP since 2013, holding significant quantities of the asset in various dormant wallets. According to his post, movement in at least one of these wallets occurred in February, which he interprets as a signal of upcoming developments, specifically referencing “X-Payments” as a possible application. He presents this as evidence of behind-the-scenes alignment among influential figures and institutional forces. Patience Urged for Supporters and Early Investors He concludes the message by advising followers to remain patient, expressing confidence that those who invested early in XRP will eventually benefit from the long-term strategy. He finishes by stating that these developments are part of a larger, unstoppable force, writing, “Nobody can stop what God is sending.” The post is positioned as a high-level summary of Remi’s beliefs about XRP’s future, drawing on personal research and undisclosed sources. While it reflects a speculative narrative, it remains consistent with themes he and others have expressed in crypto communities over the years regarding the potential role of XRP in future financial infrastructures.

According to data shared on X by Lookonchain, on Apr. 9, a wallet linked to WLFI reportedly sold 5,471 Ethereum ( ETH ) for around $8 million, at a price of $1,465 per coin. The sale represents a major loss. WLFI had previously spent around $210 million to acquire 67,498 ETH at an average price of $3,259.

The stablecoin is promoted as a safe substitute for algorithmic or undercollateralized tokens. WLFI was established in 2024 and positions itself as a decentralized finance platform that provides financial tools based on blockchain technology. Through its token sale, the project raised $550 million, including $75 million from Tron founder Justin Sun, who later joined the platform as an advisor. However, the firm has faced governance concerns and criticism over political influence due to its Trump connections. As reported by crypto.news on Apr. 1, The Trump family gained majority control of the platform in January by acquiring a 60% share through a new holding company, WLF Holdco LLC. As a result, they will control 60% of the company’s operating profits after the platform is fully operational, and they are also entitled to 75% of the token sales revenue under the new structure.

The crypto exchange has recently updated its burn mechanism according to on-chain usage. According to a press release sent to crypto.news on April 9, the crypto exchange will be using a new burn mechanism for its native token that takes into account more of its on-chain usage. The new mechanism uses a utility-based model to calculate the amount of Bitget Tokens ( BGB ) to burn. The updated burn formula directly links quarterly burn volumes to the amount of BGB paid to on-chain gas fees through the firm’s GetGas accounts. Under the new mechanism for Q1 2025, the platform added approximately 6,943 BGB to its GetGas accounts. Therefore, Bitget is preparing to burn a total of 30 million BGB for this quarter, which is equal to more than $120 million based on current market prices. This means that 30 million BGB will be removed from its total token supply, potentially boosting the remaining token’s value. At press time, BGB has gone down nearly 2.5% in the past 24 hours. It is currently trading hands at $4.07, despite reaching a $4.20 a day prior. The token is still more than 50% below its all-time high of $8.45, which was recorded at the end of December 2024.

CEO of Bitget, Gracy Chen, stated that a more sustainable burn mechanism was an expected change, considering BGB is in the process of expanding its role within various on-chain ecosystems. “By linking its burn mechanism to actual on-chain utility, BGB’s quarterly burn amount can evolve with real usage. This update incentivizes adoption and enables transparent and sustainable tokenomics,” said Chen in her statement. In January 2025, the crypto exchange burned 800 million BGB held by the internal team, which represented 40% of the total supply. This burn reduced the token’s circulating supply from 2 billion BGB to 1.2 billion BGB.

In an April 8 X post , Analyst Dom pointed out that XRP is now filling a “liquidity void”, essentially correcting an inefficiency in price action from back in late November. That puts the asset in a tight range between around $1.50 and $2.00. The analyst noted that the $2 mark serves as a critical resistance level and key accumulation zone. A clean break above it would signal a potential structure shift that could officially end the current downtrend. At press time, XRP ( XRP ) was down 3.3% over the past 24 hours, exchanging hands at $1.80, while its market cap was seated at over $104 billion. Its daily trading volume had also dipped 42% to $6.3 billion. Bullish catalysts for XRP Nevertheless, a number of positive XRP-related developments are leading many traders to believe that XRP could be gearing up for a bullish rally. First, the launch of Teucrium’s leveraged XRP ETF (XXRP) marks the first XRP-linked ETF in the U.S., offering double daily returns on XRP. This sets a major precedent for institutional involvement and legitimises Ripple-based investment products in traditional markets. This milestone comes on the heels of the SEC dropping its appeal and settling the Ripple case with a $50 million penalty, effectively removing longstanding regulatory uncertainty around XRP. The legal clarity has sparked renewed institutional interest, with firms like Franklin Templeton, Bitwise, and 21Shares now pursuing spot XRP ETFs.

According to Polymarket data , approval odds have climbed back to 77%, recovering from a dip to 72% recorded on April 7. Second, Ripple has announced the acquisition of prime brokerage firm Hidden Road in a $1.25 billion deal, one of the largest in the crypto industry’s history. The move expands Ripple’s institutional footprint by leveraging Hidden Road’s established client network, positioning Ripple as a more dominant player in global finance. Third, on-chain metrics support a bullish outlook. Data from Santiment reveals a steady accumulation by wallets holding 100,000 to 100 million XRP, typically considered smart money. This buying activity during the dip suggests strong conviction among larger investors, often seen as a precursor to upward price movement. XRP’s MVRV Z-Score has also dropped to 1.43, its lowest level since November of last year. That’s notable because the last time it was this low, XRP kicked off a bull run and eventually hit its all-time high of $3.40. Source: Santiment A lower MVRV Z-Score usually means the asset is undervalued compared to its historical average, which can be a sign that the market is near a bottom and primed for a rebound. Meanwhile, its weighted funding rate has flipped back to green, indicating improved investor sentiment among XRP derivative traders, as more of them are now placing bullish bets after a period of caution. Source: CoinGlass According to analysts at crypto.news , $2 is the most likely next target for XRP. On a longer time frame, experts at Standard Chartered have set an even higher price target, projecting $5.5 as a realistic target by the year-end. Their forecast comes after XRP’s 580% rally from November 2024 to January 2025, suggesting there’s room for another 214% move from current levels. XRP still in correction phase However, Trader Chetan Gurjar believes XRP is still in its wave 2 correction phase, based on the Elliott Wave theory, a popular trading method where price moves in patterns of five waves up when the market is trending and three waves down when it’s correcting. Right now, Chetan thinks XRP is in one of those “down” phases, wave 2, which usually happens before the next big move up. He sees this dip as a healthy retracement, with possible bottom zones around key Fibonacci levels: $1.48, $1.1453, and $0.8856. Chetan has some lofty long-term targets too: at least $8–$12, with the possibility of XRP reaching as high as $23–$30 during the next major cycle. He does note, though, that a breakdown below $0.3823 would invalidate his current wave count.

Amid this, the Cardano (ADA) price prediction has become a key topic of discussion, whether the current price rebound is genuine or merely a normal price correction before further downward movement. Cardano (ADA) Technical Analysis and Price Action Data from CoinMarketCap reveals that ADA has lost over 24% of its value in the past month. Following this notable price decline, the asset has lost its hold on a key support level at $0.64. This level has a strong history of triggering price reversals and rebounds. Source: Trading View According to Coinpedia’s technical analysis, ADA is poised to continue its downward momentum as it has successfully closed a daily candle below the key support level. Additionally, the asset has also retested that breakdown level. On the smaller time frame (Four-Hour Chart), ADA appears to be moving in an uptrend, taking support from an ascending trendline. Cardano (ADA) Price Prediction Based on recent price action and historical momentum, if ADA falls further and closes a four-hour candle below the trendline support, there is a strong possibility it could decline by 20% to reach the $0.43 level in the coming days. Source: Trading Volume At present, ADA is trading below the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on both the four-hour and daily time frames. This indicates that the asset is in strong bearish momentum and is showing weak price action. However, in such conditions, investors and traders often look for an upside rally as a shorting opportunity. Current Price Momentum ADA is currently trading near $0.575 and has recorded a price decline of over 2% in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, during the same period, its trading volume dropped by 15%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day. $16.40 Million Worth of Bearish Bet Looking at the current price momentum and ADA’s bearish outlook, traders seem to be strongly betting on the bearish side, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass. Source: Coinglass Data further reveals that traders are currently over-leveraged at $0.544 on the lower side (support) and $0.588 on the upper side (resistance). At these levels, traders have built $8.33 million and $16.40 million worth of long and short positions, respectively.

This isn't new | shocking: https://t.co/ukhDxjyKuk — Adrian Morris (@Adrian_R_Morris) April 8, 2025 Bitcoin has been wildly volatile over the last week as traders and digital asset investors scrambled to get ahead of a “crisis scenario” for BTC. Micheal Saylor’s software company-turned-bitcoin buyer Strategy has warned it could be forced to sell some of its Bitcoin to meet its financial obligations. The firm noted in a recent 8-K filing with the SEC that without access to favorable equity or debt financing, it could be required to liquidate BTC at a loss or under unfavorable terms. The company has acquired 275,965 BTC at an average price of $93,228 since Trump’s November 2024 election win. The firm also currently holds nearly 530,000 BTC at an average cost of $67,000 per Bitcoin, valued at roughly $42 billion. Strategy has fueled its digital asset purchases by selling convertible bonds and issuing stock. “As Bitcoin constitutes the vast bulk of assets on our balance sheet, if we are unable to secure equity or debt financing in a timely manner … we may be required to sell Bitcoin to satisfy our financial obligations, and we may be required to make such sales at prices below our cost basis or that are otherwise unfavorable.” ~ Strategy. The software company acknowledged that it’s expecting to record a near -$6 billion unrealized loss for the first quarter, despite a related $1.69 billion income tax benefit. Strategy also warned it might not be able to regain profitability in future quarters, especially if the value of its BTC continues to drop. The largest BTC Treasury company held around $8 billion worth of debt at the end of March. It also owes about $35 million per year in interest in addition to around $150 million it must pay every year in dividends on its stock. The filing highlighted that “a significant decrease in the market value of our Bitcoin holdings could adversely affect our ability to satisfy our financial obligations.” The firm’s share price has almost halved since soaring to its November peak that saw it inducted into the Nasdaq 100 index. Bloomberg Intelligence senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone argued that “Everyone’s in for the long-term, as long as it’s going up.” He also mentioned that he didn’t know how BTC was going to get to $100,000 from $10,000 in 2020, but the trends showed up. Now, he sees the reversion path “back towards $10,000.” Trump’s trade war causes Bitcoin to fall Bitcoin plummeted sharply in the wake of Donald Trump’s sweeping reciprocal tariffs, which were announced on Wednesday and branded as “Liberation Day.” He imposed a 10% baseline tariff on all imports to the U.S. but added higher rates on other nations based on how they tax U.S. goods. The U.S. President argued that the move was a way to erase America’s trade deficit and protect U.S. manufacturers. Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi has warned that extended tariffs could push both the U.S. and its trading partners into recessions. The crypto market breathed a sigh of relief after Trump announced the 10% across-the-board tariff since many expected harsher measures. The initial reaction caused BTC to drop to around $88,000. After he announced additional tariffs and higher rates on major trade partners, concerns over inflation and economic uncertainty sent Bitcoin tumbling down to $81,000. The virtual currency has also plummeted to lows not seen since early November and is currently exchanging hands at $76,908 at the time of publication, a 3.55% drop in the last 24 hours.

43113430,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=147675,1744184759,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Record Surge: South Korean Won Shatters December High Against US Dollar,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/korean-won-surges-against-dollar/,"In a dramatic turn of events in the currency markets, the South Korean Won has demonstrated remarkable strength, surging past its previous high from December against the U.S. dollar. Just as trading commenced on April 9th, the Won experienced a significant leap, reaching 1,487.3 Won per dollar. This bold move surpasses the earlier peak of 1,487.04 Won witnessed on December 27th, signaling a potentially impactful shift in the currency market dynamics. What does this mean for the South Korean economy and the broader global financial landscape? Let’s dive deep into understanding this exciting development. South Korean Won Surges to New Heights The recent appreciation of the South Korean Won against the U.S. dollar is a noteworthy event. After opening on April 9th, the currency quickly ascended to 1,487.3 won per dollar. To put this into perspective, consider these key points: New Peak: The 1,487.3 won mark is higher than the December 27th peak of 1,487.04 won, establishing a new high point for the Won in recent months. Rapid Rise: This surge occurred shortly after the trading day began, indicating strong and immediate market reaction. Market Sentiment: Such a rapid rise can reflect shifting market sentiment and potentially increased confidence in the South Korean economy or factors weakening the U.S. dollar. This upward movement in the Won Dollar Exchange Rate is more than just a number; it represents a complex interplay of economic factors and market perceptions. But what exactly is fueling this surge? Decoding the Factors Behind the Won’s Strength Several factors could be contributing to the Korean Currency’s impressive performance. Let’s explore some potential drivers: South Korea’s Economic Indicators: Positive economic data from South Korea, such as strong export figures, robust GDP growth, or decreasing inflation, could boost investor confidence in the Won. If the South Korean economy is perceived as strong and stable, demand for its currency tends to increase. U.S. Dollar Weakness: Conversely, weakness in the U.S. dollar can also contribute to the Won’s rise. Factors that might weaken the dollar include dovish signals from the Federal Reserve, concerns about the U.S. economy, or geopolitical uncertainties affecting the dollar’s appeal as a safe-haven asset. Global Risk Sentiment: Changes in global risk appetite can influence currency flows. If investors are feeling more risk-on, they may move away from the perceived safety of the U.S. dollar and invest in currencies like the South Korean Won , which might be seen as offering higher growth potential. Foreign Investment Flows: Increased foreign investment into South Korean assets, such as stocks and bonds, would naturally increase demand for the Won, pushing its value higher. Intervention by the Bank of Korea: While less likely to be the primary driver of a sudden surge, intervention by the Bank of Korea (BOK) to manage currency volatility can also play a role. However, in this case, the sharp rise suggests market forces are predominantly at play. To truly understand the sustained nature of this trend, we need to monitor upcoming economic releases from both South Korea and the United States, as well as global market sentiment. Impact and Implications of a Stronger Won A strengthening Korean Currency , while seemingly positive, has both benefits and challenges for the South Korean economy. Let’s break down the potential impacts: Benefits: Reduced Import Costs: A stronger Won makes imports cheaper in local currency terms. This can help to lower inflation, especially for imported goods and raw materials. Increased Purchasing Power: South Korean consumers benefit from increased purchasing power for goods and services priced in foreign currencies, including travel abroad. Lower Foreign Debt Burden: For South Korea, which holds foreign currency-denominated debt, a stronger Won reduces the burden of repayment in local currency terms. Challenges: Exports Competitiveness: A stronger Won makes South Korean exports more expensive for foreign buyers, potentially impacting the competitiveness of export-oriented industries, which are crucial for the South Korean economy. This is a significant concern, especially for sectors like electronics, automobiles, and shipbuilding. Potential for Reduced Tourism Revenue: While South Koreans may find it cheaper to travel abroad, a stronger Won can make South Korea a more expensive destination for foreign tourists, potentially impacting tourism revenue. Impact on Corporate Earnings: Companies with significant export revenues may see their earnings, when converted back to Won, reduced due to the stronger currency. The overall impact of a stronger Won Dollar Exchange Rate depends on the magnitude and duration of the appreciation, as well as the broader global economic context. Policymakers in South Korea will be closely monitoring these developments to ensure balanced economic growth. Navigating the Currency Market: What Does This Mean for Investors? For investors, fluctuations in the Currency Market always present both opportunities and risks. Here’s what to consider in light of the South Korean Won’s recent surge: Monitoring USD/KRW: Keep a close eye on the USD/KRW exchange rate. Understanding the trend and volatility is crucial for anyone with investments linked to either currency. Impact on South Korean Assets: For investors holding South Korean assets (stocks, bonds, etc.), a stronger Won can enhance returns when those assets are valued in foreign currencies. However, be mindful of the potential negative impact on export-oriented companies’ earnings, as mentioned earlier. Currency Hedging: Businesses and investors involved in international trade or investments should consider currency hedging strategies to mitigate risks associated with exchange rate volatility. Diversification: Currency fluctuations highlight the importance of portfolio diversification. Holding assets in different currencies can help to reduce overall risk. Actionable Insight: For those interested in the Won Dollar Exchange Rate , setting up alerts for key levels and monitoring economic news from both South Korea and the U.S. is a prudent step. Understanding the underlying drivers of currency movements is crucial for informed investment decisions. Looking Ahead: Future Trajectory of the USD/KRW Predicting future currency movements is inherently complex, but we can consider factors that will likely influence the USD/KRW exchange rate in the coming months: Global Economic Conditions: The overall health of the global economy, trade tensions, and geopolitical events will play a significant role. Monetary Policy: Decisions by the Federal Reserve in the U.S. and the Bank of Korea regarding interest rates will be crucial. Divergence in monetary policy can lead to significant currency movements. Inflation Trends: Inflation rates in both countries and how central banks respond to them will be a key determinant. Capital Flows: The direction and magnitude of capital flows into and out of South Korea will directly impact the demand for the Won. The recent surge of the South Korean Won is a powerful reminder of the dynamic nature of currency markets and their sensitivity to a multitude of factors. Keeping abreast of these developments is essential for businesses, investors, and anyone with an interest in the global economy. Conclusion: A Bold Statement from the South Korean Won The South Korean Won’s recent ascent past its December high against the U.S. dollar is more than just a minor fluctuation; it’s a powerful statement reflecting underlying shifts in economic forces and market sentiment. While the benefits of a stronger Won include reduced import costs and increased purchasing power, challenges related to export competitiveness and corporate earnings need careful monitoring. For investors, understanding these currency dynamics is paramount for navigating the complexities of the global financial landscape. As we move forward, observing the interplay of economic indicators, monetary policies, and global events will be key to deciphering the future trajectory of the USD/KRW and its broader implications.

Recent market narratives show uncertainty around U.S. policies, including tariffs and a hawkish Federal Reserve stance with fewer expected rate cuts in 2025, providing the fundamental backdrop for a move further lower in crypto majors. Here’s what technical analysis and price-action indicate for these tokens in the near term. XRP Price Analysis XRP, the token closely related to payments firm Ripple Labs, is below critical support levels with the next support threshold around the $1.60 mark. High leverage in XRP trading positions, as Coinglass data shows, hints at potential for more downward pressure before any recovery. A potential double bottom pattern has formed near $1.80; the overall market structure remains bearish despite modest recovery attempts from the $1.60-$1.70 range. Technical indicators show deeply oversold conditions with RSI at 22.41, while the MACD and Chaikin Money Flow (-0.17) signal strong bearish momentum as money flows out of the asset. The 50% Fibonacci retracement level at $1.91 is currently acting as a pivotal point for a potential trend reversal in the near term. Price action shows a series of lower highs from the $2 support zone. A bullish divergence has formed on lower timeframes, suggesting stabilization. This will now act as a resistance level after previously being a critical support level. Momentum indicators have shifted from bearish to neutral in recent trading. RSI indicates oversold conditions, suggesting potential for a reversal if bullish momentum builds. The MACD shows a bearish crossover, reinforcing a downward bias unless a reversal signal emerges. SOL Price Analysis SOL is down over 8% in a week and in a crucial support zone between $100 and $110. The current slump suggests it may be revisiting these levels or even lower, with thin liquidity below $100 potentially leading to a sharper fall toward as low as $50. SOL experienced a dramatic 22% drop from $122.75 to $95.72 between April 5-7, with partial recovery establishing a new trading range between $103-$112. Major Solana whales unstaked and dumped significant holdings, with one transaction worth approximately $30 million coinciding with a $200 million token unlock event. Needs to reclaim $112 to target $120; failure could see a drop to $96. The RSI is consistently below 40, indicating strong bearish momentum and oversold conditions. MACD shows bearish crossovers, aligning with a downward trend. Price is below key moving averages ($130.5 and $184.2), reinforcing bearish bias. Technical structure suggests more downside risk unless $112 is reclaimed. ADA Price Analysis ADA has similarly declined by about 6% in the past 24 hours and down over 23% in the past two weeks. Daily RSI is at 32, suggesting ADA is nearing oversold territory (typically below 30) but still has room for further downside before a potential reversal. This indicates bearish momentum persists, though exhaustion may be nearing. ADA is trading below its 21-day moving averages on a daily timeframe, confirming a bearish trend. However, ADA is currently within a falling wedge pattern on the daily timeframe. This is typically a bullish reversal pattern, with a dip to 60 cents– 61 cents expected before a potential sharp upward reversal, possibly forming a bear trap. Outlook For XRP, watch $1.62 as a pivotal support; a break below could see it target $1 or lower, while a bounce might signal a short-term relief rally. SOL’s fate hinges on holding $100—failure here could accelerate losses, but oversold conditions might spark a rebound if macro pressures ease.

Ripple also claimed that with the acquisition, it became the first crypto company to own and operate a global, multi-asset prime broker. Hidden Road clears $3 trillion annually across markets with over 300 institutional clients. Large prime brokers help in the day-to-day operations of clearing, securities lending, and leveraged trade execution, among others, for large hedge funds and institutional investors. “But the price tag isn’t what’s most important,” said CEO Brad Garlinghouse, who added, “It’s that this deal marks a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for crypto to access the largest and most trusted traditional markets, and vice versa.” Inflection Point for Crypto Adoption Garlinghouse explained that this is the capital and activity “that will tap into XRP and the XRP Ledger’s bread-and-butter – instant, efficient, scalable and low-cost movement of value.” He added that instead of waiting for 24 hours to settle trades through fiat rails, Hidden Road will be using XRPL for clearing a portion of trades. It will also use RLUSD, the firm’s stablecoin, as collateral across its prime brokerage services, including cross-asset crypto and traditional instrument trades, he said. “With this deal and the backing of Ripple’s significant balance sheet, Hidden Road will exponentially expand its capacity to service its pipeline and become the largest non-bank prime broker globally.” Today, @Ripple announced the acquisition of Hidden Road for $1.25B, one of the largest deals ever in the crypto space. But the price tag isn’t what’s most important – it’s that this deal marks a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for crypto to access the largest and most trusted… — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) April 8, 2025 Garlinghouse also said that we are at an “inflection point” for the next phase of crypto asset adoption, adding that the US market is “effectively open for the first time due to the regulatory overhang of the former SEC coming to an end.” However, the company has now shelved its initial public offering ambitions . XRP Price Tanks Ripple’s native token, XRP, has tanked around 10% over the past 12 hours despite the announcement. However, this is attributed to a wider crypto market slump as investors flee from high-risk assets amid economic concerns exacerbated by Donald Trump’s global trade war. The asset fell from an intraday high of just under $2 to $1.73 during the Wednesday morning Asian trading session as crypto markets turned red again. XRP has lost almost 50% since its mid-January all-time high equalling surge, but it remains one of the better-performing digital assets this year. The wider crypto market was down more than 7% on the day as Trump’s tariffs, including a hefty 104% on China , went live on Wednesday.

This move by a wallet linked to Trump-affiliated group has raised questions over why the entity would choose to sell the tokens at such a substantial loss. Wallet Linked To WLFI Moves Over 5K ETH Notably, as per data from Arkham Intelligence , the wallet moved over 5,471 ETH for approximately $8 million. The sale took place at an average price of $1,465, which is far below its original purchase price. Previously, WLFI had bought 67,498 ETH for about $210 million, at an average price around $3,259 for each ETH. However, with Ethereum’s current prices at significantly low levels, the company stands at an unrealized loss of about $125 million. This implies that WLFI lost nearly 55% on the sale, selling it for just $8.01 million, less than about $7.9 million than what they originally paid for it. While some believe that the sale could be a strategic move to rebalance its portfolio or free up the capital, others may see it as a sign of panic amidst market chaos. Are Long Term Whales Losing Interest? Besides, the long term Ether whales also seem to have lost interest as in another news, a prominent ETH whale has exited the market as it sold 10,000 ETH after holding it for over 900 days, at a profit of $2.75 million. The whale bought 10,000 ETH in two separate transactions during October and November 2022, spending $13 million at an average price of $1,295 per coin. What’s intriguing here is that the whale continued to hold Ethereum at $4000 levels, with a profit over $27 million, and finally decided to settle down at lesser profits. Two other whales also made major moves as one whale had to pump in over $14.5 million to protect a massive 220,000 ETH position from liquidation. While another whale lost 67,570 ETH (worth $106 million) after their DeFi position on lending platform Sky got liquidated. With major whale moves and entities like WLF offloading its holdings, investors carefully gauge the market conditions and whether these moves could trigger a broader retail sell-off. Analyst Notes Key Support Level In a recent X post, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has pointed towards $1,200 as a key support level for Ethereum. As the market slides, he believes that this price could help ETH stabilize and prevent a deeper drop. $1,200 could be where #Ethereum $ETH finds its footing! pic.twitter.com/ds0maPuHtA — Ali (@ali_charts) April 8, 2025 Meanwhile, Ethereum faces continued losses as it currently trades at $1,472, down over 6% in the past day. Despite expectations of a massive crypto rally post Trump coming into the office, Ethereum has witnessed a drop over 56% since the start of the year. Why did World Liberty Financial (WLF) sell Ethereum at a massive loss? WLF hasn’t shared an official reason, some believe that it could be a strategic decision to rebalance their portfolio, free up liquidity, or reduce exposure during heightened market volatility. While others see it as a potential panic move amid market chaos. How much has WLF lost on its Ethereum investment? WLF purchased 67,498 ETH for about $210 million at an average price of $3,259. But with the recent sale of 5,471 ETH at $1,465 each, they locked in a 55% loss, roughly $7.9 million down on this sale alone.

From cryptocurrency to artificial intelligence, these breakthroughs have redefined the possibilities regarding technical limitations. Bold new teams like Fexse want to push things further and continue innovating atop this groundwork. Fexse is a blockchain-powered Token Studio launching in 2025 with a mission to make real-world assets (RWA), like artwork, real estate, and funds, accessible to global investors through tokenization and decentralized governance. The company is revolutionizing the investment world with RWA tokenization. Asset owners can tokenize their assets and offer them to a global investor base. The Origins of Blockchain Many new pieces of technology gained prominence in society in early 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic and its ensuing lockdowns. As people were forced to stay within their homes in unprecedented numbers, many increasingly turned to online outlets and platforms for information, entertainment, and communication. This unique and unparalleled sociopolitical ecosystem allowed for numerous new aspects of technology to take hold (this was the same period when TikTok became popular in the US). While cryptocurrency and AI were largely dismissed when first gaining public attention, they ultimately continued to evolve, prove their worth, and become pillars of modern society. Now, with a more widespread acceptance of their usage, these tools are being applied to entirely new problems, resulting in further integrated solutions. Fexse’s use of blockchain to own real-world assets is a perfect example. The Empowerment of Fexse Users The brand empowers asset owners to tokenize real-world assets and distribute fractional ownership to global investors. Fexse users can invest in tokenized assets and receive consistent returns, such as rental income. Launching globally in 2025, the platform is built to democratize access to traditionally exclusive investment opportunities with state-of-the-art security. As the company’s website states, “Fexse also ensures infrastructure security through enterprise-grade encryption protocols and rigorous smart contract audits, safeguarding investor assets and transaction integrity.” Fexse also provides consistent returns for investors. Periodic earnings will be distributed to token holders. DAO-based governance ensures transparency, security, and community decision-making regarding the management of tokenized assets. Fexse will significantly reduce transaction costs by as much as 30% compared to traditional financial systems. This is supported by market predictions that the RWA tokenization market could reach $16 trillion by 2030. The platform is designed for inclusivity, transparency, security, and financial innovation. Bünyamin Saraç, spokesperson for Fexse, says, “At Fexse, we are here to revolutionize the investment world. With tokenization, investors are no longer limited to those with large capital—everyone can participate. We make real-world assets accessible through blockchain.” Final Thoughts In many ways, Fexse’s innovation indicates how these recent technological breakthroughs are breaking out of online containment and becoming tactile factors within the real world. While something like cryptocurrency was designed to digitize funds, numerous crypto sites now offer physical crypto cards, and countless venues offer crypto readers, enabling crypto users to bring that experience from the digital domain into the physical world.",Press Release,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-09 07:53:32

A Florida federal judge, Federico Moreno, approved the final settlement on April 1, with the order made public on April 8. The settlement establishes an $11 million fund for eligible investors who purchased Astrals NFTs between May 2022 and January 15, 2024, or acquired the project’s GLXY tokens during that period. Judge Approves $2.9M in Legal Fees in Shaquille O’Neal’s Astrals NFT Settlement The court also approved $2.9 million in attorney fees and associated costs. Judge Moreno ruled the fee request was “fair and reasonable,” with no objections from the plaintiffs. The lawsuit, initially filed in May 2023 , alleged that Shaquille O’Neal had promoted and helped launch the Astrals NFT collection, which plaintiffs argued amounted to the unregistered sale of securities. They claimed to have suffered financial losses due to O’Neal’s promotional efforts. In August, Judge Moreno acknowledged that the plaintiffs had plausibly alleged the former athlete acted as a seller under securities law. O’Neal reached a settlement agreement in November. Astrals NFTs launched in April 2022 and featured 10,000 unique 3D avatars created by artist Damien Guimoneau. The project pitched itself as an immersive metaverse experience where users could interact with each other and with O’Neal himself. However, the collection has shown no signs of activity in the past two years, according to NFT marketplace OpenSea. The next shot – Shaquille O’Neal and #Astrals NFTs + $GLXY tokens. Shaq actively promoted the tokens, calling himself ""Astrals Chief Astronaut."" But after the FTX collapse in November 2022, the project’s reputation took a hit, and token sales slowed significantly. $GLXY is down… pic.twitter.com/quHziiGCdA — 11th.com (@11thestate) March 28, 2025 Last year, a U.S. federal court partially dismissed a class-action lawsuit against O’Neal related to his involvement in the NFT project Astrals. The lawsuit accused O’Neal of being the public face of Astrals, urging investors to join the project with phrases like, “Hop on the wave before it’s too late.” Despite the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX in November 2022, O’Neal remained publicly supportive of Astrals. In its ruling, the court dismissed the claim that O’Neal was a “control person” within the project, meaning someone who held actual power or control over its operations. NFT Market Activity Remains Subdued NFT market activity remains subdued in 2025. As of April 7, total NFT sales volume stood at just $27 million for the week, a steep decline from the $2 billion-plus weekly volumes recorded during the 2021 market peak, according to CryptoSlam. As reported, NFT trading volumes plummeted by more than 60% in February, continuing a downward trend that began in early 2024. It is worth noting that there has been a trend of companies discontinuing their involvement in the NFT space. Back in March, Starbucks, the renowned multinational coffee chain, made the decision to terminate its NFT rewards program . In January, gaming retailer GameStop announced the closure of its NFT marketplace after scaling back its crypto services over the past two years. Likewise, X, under the ownership of Elon Musk, discontinued a feature that allowed premium users to use NFT images as their profile pictures.

The U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have just experienced a significant jolt. On April 8th, these much-talked-about investment vehicles saw a staggering $326.55 million in total net outflows. This marks the fourth consecutive trading day of investors pulling their funds out. What’s behind this sudden shift, and what does it mean for the broader crypto market? Let’s dive into the details. What’s Causing the Bitcoin ETF Outflows? According to data shared by Trader T (@thepfund) on X, the recent Bitcoin ETF outflows are widespread across several major ETF providers. It wasn’t just one or two funds feeling the pinch; a range of established players experienced significant withdrawals. Here’s a breakdown of where the largest outflows occurred: BlackRock’s IBIT: Leading the pack with a massive $253.18 million in net outflows. This is particularly noteworthy considering IBIT’s previously strong performance and inflows. Bitwise’s BITB: Recorded $21.71 million in net outflows. ARK Invest’s ARKB: Experienced $19.90 million in net outflows. Franklin Templeton’s EZBC: Saw $8.89 million leave the fund. Grayscale’s GBTC: Continued its outflow trend with $8.49 million in net outflows. BTC and Invesco’s BTCO: Also faced outflows of $7.48 million and $6.90 million , respectively. Interestingly, the report indicates that the remaining spot Bitcoin ETFs didn’t experience any change in holdings on April 8th. This suggests that the outflows are concentrated in specific funds, possibly due to varied investor sentiment or fund-specific factors. Spot Bitcoin ETF Performance: A Quick Recap Spot Bitcoin ETFs were launched with much fanfare and anticipation, offering traditional investors a regulated and accessible way to gain exposure to Bitcoin. For months, these ETFs saw impressive inflows, contributing to Bitcoin’s price rallies and overall market optimism. However, the tide seems to be turning, at least temporarily. To understand the current situation better, let’s consider: Initial Success: The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs was a landmark moment, attracting billions in assets under management (AUM) in a short period. Positive Price Impact: The inflows into these ETFs were widely believed to be a significant driver behind Bitcoin’s price surge to new all-time highs earlier this year. Shifting Sentiment?: The recent outflows raise questions about whether investor sentiment is shifting, or if this is just a temporary correction within the broader bullish trend. Impact on the Crypto Market The health of spot Bitcoin ETF flows is often seen as a barometer for institutional interest in Bitcoin and the broader crypto market . Significant outflows can be interpreted in several ways: Profit Taking: Investors might be taking profits after Bitcoin’s recent price appreciation. Risk Aversion: Broader macroeconomic factors or increased market volatility could be prompting investors to reduce their exposure to riskier assets like Bitcoin. Rotation into Other Assets: Funds could be rotating out of Bitcoin and into other asset classes, including other cryptocurrencies or traditional markets. While four days of outflows might seem concerning, it’s crucial to remember that the crypto market is known for its volatility. Short-term fluctuations are common, and it’s important to analyze trends over a longer period to get a clearer picture. Bitcoin Investment Strategy in Light of ETF Outflows So, what should investors do in the face of these ETF outflows ? Here are a few actionable insights: Don’t Panic Sell: Short-term market dips are normal. Avoid making impulsive decisions based on a few days of data. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that Bitcoin investment is often considered a long-term play. Focus on the fundamental value proposition of Bitcoin and its potential for future growth. Diversification: Ensure your portfolio is well-diversified. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, especially in a volatile market like crypto. Stay Informed: Keep track of market news and analysis from reputable sources. Understanding the broader context can help you make informed investment decisions. The recent Bitcoin ETF outflows serve as a reminder that the crypto market is dynamic and subject to shifts in investor sentiment. While the outflows are noteworthy, it’s essential to maintain a balanced perspective, consider the long-term potential of Bitcoin, and avoid knee-jerk reactions. The coming weeks will be crucial in determining whether this is a temporary blip or the start of a more sustained trend.

While the $2000 mark remains unattainable for ETH, experts bet on IntelMarkets’ growth. Table of Contents Ethereum forecast reveals $2000 target hard for ETH IntelMarkets’ cutting-edge scalability attracts modern traders Ethereum ( ETH ) price has been highly bullish amid the broader market decline. As the ETH shows recovery to $1,500 levels, some investors get excited about further increases, but the Ethereum price predictions paint a different picture. Meanwhile, investors flock to IntelMarkets as the AI platform has become the leading choice for whales in its presale stage. Let’s explore the Ethereum price predictions and INTL’s features. Ethereum forecast reveals $2000 target hard for ETH ETH price suffered a more than 27% slump within the past week, briefly dropping to a two-year low of $1,410 before recovering the $1,500 level on Monday. The decline, per Coinglass data, sparked $257.87 million in liquidations across ETH’s derivatives market during the period. This resulted in bearish Ethereum forecasts. On-chain data also shows most investors are capitulating, sending ETH’s realized losses past $500 million. Most recent selling activity stems from coins purchased in the past month, highlighting short-term holders’ strong reaction to downside price moves. Further bearish Ethereum price predictions suggest the $2,000 mark is a far-stretched target for ETH. Moreover, coins launched in the past year are joining the selling but at a modest pace. An increase in selling pressure from this cohort could spark an extended decline in ETH, as most buy-the-dip activity has largely flowed into addresses related to them. Ethereum price is grappling with the support level near $1,522 after seeing a quick bounce off the lower boundary of the descending channel. The top altcoin could suffer a further decline to the support near $1,000 if it breaches the channel’s lower end.

Experts are calling this a “ rush to the exit ,” as investors race to convert their holdings into cash. What this great liquidation means for the cryptocurrency market , which has already declined by 5.4% in the last 24 hours. Curious to know? Read on! What’s Happening Across Asset Classes? US President Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump is an American former president politician, businessman, and media personality, who served as the 45th president of the U.S. between 2017 to 2021. Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President aggressive tariff policy has adversely affected almost all the major markets across the globe. It has triggered severe turmoil in the market. Unlike the past, even so-called safer assets have been affected due to market uncertainty. Yesterday alone, the S&P 500 index, a major index in the United States, dropped by over 4.031%, and the Nasdaq 100 index, another prominent index in the country, declined by no fewer than 5.23%. Importantly, at the start of this month, the price of WTI Crude Oil was around $71.34. Since then, it has slipped by over 18.76%. Notably, during the same period, the gold market has decreased by 2.48%, indicating that even this market has not been spared from the rising selling pressure in the global market. Why Is This Not Normal? Usually, during market uncertainty, investors move from risky assets like stocks to safer assets like gold. Normally, when one asset goes down, others go up. What is disturbing is that everything is falling together right now. Adam Kobeissi states that investors are liquidating all assets to hold cash. Unfortunately, this happens in times of panic or deep uncertainty.

Tariff News Live Update, Stock Market Crash, Asian Market Today , What This Great Liquidation Means for the Crypto Market The cryptocurrency market has experienced a fall of 5.4% in the last 24 hours. During the same time, almost all the top cryptos have declined; Bitcoin has slipped by 2.6%, Ethereum by 6.5%, XRP by 2.0%, BNB by 0.9%, Solana by 1.5% and Dogecoin by 1.9%. However, as of now, the total cryptocurrency market cap stands at least 1.25% above where it was at the time of opening. Likewise, the market cap of cryptos, excluding BTC, has grown from $875.85B to $884.44B, and the market cap of cryptos, excluding the top ten cryptos, has climbed from $188.51B to $192.9B. In conclusion, the great liquidation wave has not spared cryptocurrencies, with top tokens facing sharp declines. However, a rise in the total crypto market cap – especially among altcoins – suggests underlying buying interest. While fear grips global markets, savvy investors may see this correction as a rare entry point. As traditional safe havens like gold also fall, crypto remains volatile but resilient. The coming days will test whether it acts as a risk asset – or a refuge. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

43113588,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=147683,1744185606,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Alarming Tariffs Threaten US Bitcoin Mining Dominance: Expert Insight,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/tariffs-threaten-us-bitcoin-mining/,"Is the booming U.S. Bitcoin mining industry facing an unexpected hurdle? Recent tariffs are casting a shadow over the sector, potentially impacting profitability and global competitiveness. Industry expert Jaran Mellerud, CEO of Hashlabs Mining, has sounded the alarm, highlighting the significant risks these tariffs pose in a recent blog post. Let’s dive into the details and understand how these policy changes could reshape the landscape of US Bitcoin mining . How Bitcoin Mining Tariffs Could Cripple US Operations According to Mellerud’s analysis, the introduction of tariffs on imported mining equipment is set to trigger a domino effect. Ethan Vera from The Mining Pod predicts a minimum 22% price surge for mining machines within the U.S. In a sector where razor-thin margins are common, this price hike is not just a minor inconvenience; it’s a potential game-changer. Here’s a breakdown of the potential impact: Increased Operational Costs: Higher equipment costs directly translate to increased capital expenditure for miners. This can deter new entrants and squeeze the profitability of existing operations, especially smaller players. Reduced Competitiveness: Compared to miners in regions without such tariffs, US-based miners will face a significant cost disadvantage. This could lead to a decline in the US’s share of the global Bitcoin hashrate. Slower Hashrate Growth: As US miners become less competitive, investment in new mining infrastructure might slow down, impacting the overall growth of the Bitcoin hashrate globally. Potential Job Losses: If mining operations become financially unsustainable, it could lead to job losses in the crypto mining industry within the United States. Understanding the Ripple Effect on Mining Rig Prices Mellerud points out a crucial aspect of supply and demand. With decreased demand for mining rigs in the U.S. due to tariffs, manufacturers could find themselves with excess inventory. This oversupply situation might lead to a counterintuitive outcome: price reductions in other regions to attract buyers. While this could benefit miners outside the US, it further exacerbates the competitive disadvantage for domestic US Bitcoin mining operations. Let’s consider a hypothetical scenario to illustrate the impact on mining rig prices : Factor Pre-Tariff Post-Tariff (US) Post-Tariff (Other Regions) Mining Rig Price $10,000 $12,200+ (22% increase) Potentially Profitability for US Miners High (assuming efficient operations) Significantly Reduced Unaffected or Potentially Increased US Market Share in Bitcoin Mining Growing Likely to Decline Potentially Increase for other regions Why is Bitcoin Hashrate Growth at Risk? The Bitcoin hashrate is a crucial indicator of the network’s security and processing power. Slower hashrate growth could have broader implications for the Bitcoin ecosystem. If US miners, who have been significant contributors to the hashrate, reduce their operations or slow down expansion due to tariffs, it could impact the overall network growth. While other regions might compensate, the tariffs could create unnecessary friction and slow down the global expansion of the Bitcoin network’s computational power. Furthermore, reduced profitability in the US market might discourage innovation and investment in more efficient mining technologies within the country. This could hinder the long-term development of the crypto mining industry in the US, potentially pushing innovation and growth to more favorable regulatory environments. Navigating the Challenges: Actionable Insights for US Bitcoin Miners While the situation seems challenging, it’s not without potential strategies for US Bitcoin miners. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Operational Efficiency: Now more than ever, optimizing operational efficiency is critical. This includes focusing on energy-efficient mining rigs, securing competitive energy rates, and streamlining maintenance processes. Geographic Diversification: Exploring mining locations outside of the US, or in regions less affected by tariffs within the US, could be a strategic move to mitigate the impact of increased equipment costs. Advocacy and Policy Engagement: Industry stakeholders need to actively engage with policymakers to educate them about the detrimental effects of these tariffs and advocate for more favorable policies that support the growth of the US Bitcoin mining sector. Exploring Alternative Equipment Sourcing: Investigating options for sourcing mining equipment from regions not impacted by tariffs or exploring domestic manufacturing possibilities, although this might be a longer-term solution. Conclusion: A Critical Juncture for US Bitcoin Mining The introduction of tariffs presents a significant threat to the burgeoning US Bitcoin mining industry. While the long-term consequences remain to be seen, the immediate impact is clear: increased costs, reduced competitiveness, and potential slowdown in hashrate growth. For US miners, adaptability, efficiency, and proactive engagement will be crucial to navigate these challenges and ensure the continued growth and innovation within the sector. The coming months will be critical in determining how these tariffs reshape the future of Bitcoin mining in the United States and its role in the global crypto landscape.

The South Asian country sees struggles ahead in the form of US tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump, which threatens to stunt the growth of the world’s fastest-growing major economy. According to the BBC, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reduced the repo rate from 6.25% to 6% on Wednesday, its second cut this year following a previous reduction in February. The decision was confirmed by RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra, who said the central bank’s Monetary Policy Committee unanimously opted for a rate cut of 25 basis points. The RBI also revised the Standing Deposit Facility rate under the Liquidity Adjustment Facility to 5.75%. India change monetary policy to combat slowing economic growth Per Governor Malhotra’s statement, the central bank changed its monetary policy stance from “neutral” to “accommodative,” which showed its willingness to ease rates further if economic conditions continue to deteriorate. Alongside the rate cut, the RBI downgraded its GDP growth projection for both the current and next financial year from 6.7% to 6.5%. India is arguably the fastest-growing large economy, but there’s been a notable pullback from the 9.2% proposed growth rate posted in the 2023–24 fiscal year. “Concerns on trade frictions are coming true ,” Governor Malhotra said in his policy address, pointing to continued volatility in global trade as a major threat. “ Headwinds from disruptions to trade will continue to pose challenges for the economy .” According to economists from ICICI Bank, the RBI could slash rates by up to 100 basis points in this easing cycle, revising earlier calls that had expected only one more cut in 2025. Tariff fallout threatens exports and jobs As of Wednesday midnight, Indian goods entering the US are subject to additional tariffs of up to 27%. Though the tariffs on India are less severe than those imposed on China (104%) and Vietnam and Cambodia (46% and 49%, respectively), the levies could still heavily draw down the country’s economic input. Analysts at HSBC estimate that these tariffs could reduce India’s GDP by as much as 0.5 percentage points in the current fiscal year. The brunt of this decline is expected to come from a drop in export volumes and a decrease in foreign capital inflows. The Indian government’s room to maneuver through fiscal policy is constrained, with HSBC warning that “spending and tax revenues have lost steam in recent months,” limiting the state’s ability to stimulate the economy through direct interventions. One sector exposed to the harsh conditions is India’s diamond sector, which exports over a third of its polished stones to the United States. Trade experts warn that the US tariffs could cripple the industry and put thousands of jobs at risk, especially in cities like Surat, where diamond polishing is among the top sources of employment. Deflation supports easing borrowing rates India’s annual inflation rate fell to 3.62% in February 2025, down from 4.26% in January, according to the Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation (MOSPI). The figure came in below market expectations and is at the slowest pace of consumer price growth since July 2024. It was the first time in six months that inflation dipped below the RBI’s 4% midpoint target. The country also saw a slowdown in food prices, which accounted for nearly half of the consumer price index. Food inflation eased to 3.75% in February, down from 5.97% the previous month, with price declines in categories such as eggs, vegetables, pulses, and spices. Energy prices also fell, with fuel and lighting down 1.33%, while housing costs remained subdued. Overall prices declined by 0.47% month-on-month, extending a revised 1% drop in January and marking the fourth consecutive period of deflation. New Delhi pleads with Washington for tariff reprieve China and Europe may have begun retaliating with their tariff measures, but officials in New Delhi are focused on resolving issues with America through diplomatic negotiations. Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar, following a call with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Monday, stated that both countries had “agreed on the importance of the early conclusion of the Bilateral Trade Agreement.” Good to speak with @SecRubio today. Exchanged perspectives on the Indo-Pacific, the Indian Sub-continent, Europe, Middle East/West Asia and the Caribbean. Agreed on the importance of the early conclusion of the Bilateral Trade Agreement. Look forward to remaining in touch.… — Dr. S. Jaishankar (@DrSJaishankar) April 7, 2025 Cryptopolitan reported last month that India has also agreed to reduce tariffs on US imports worth $23 billion. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government lowered duties on luxury American motorcycles and bourbon and recently withdrew a digital services tax that had affected US tech firms. On the currency side of the matter, the Indian rupee reacted mildly to the central bank’s decision and trade developments, weakening slightly against the US dollar. The USDINR exchange rate rose by 0.18% to 86.5990 on Wednesday from 86.4410 in the previous session. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Sell Notification Filed with SEC!",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-btc-bull-michael-saylor-may-break-his-hodl-promise-sell-notification-filed-with-sec/,"Institutional top Bitcoin bull Strategy (MicroStratagy) may be forced to sell Bitcoin, breaking his HODL promise. Strategy noted in a recent Form 8-K filing with the SEC that if the price of Bitcoin continues to fall, the company may be forced to sell its Bitcoin assets to pay off its debts. This has led to comments from Strategy founder Michael Saylor that he may be breaking his long-standing “I will never sell Bitcoin” stance. Chinese journalist Wu Blockchain stated that this statement is a standard risk disclosure, and that similar statements were made in the 10-Q report for the first quarter of 2024, as well as in reports for 2023 and earlier. According to its latest 8-K filing with the SEC, as of March 31, 2025, Strategy is saddled with $8.22 billion in debt, $35.1 million in annual interest costs and must pay $146.2 million in preferred stock dividends each year. The company’s enterprise software business is not generating enough cash flow to service debt, raising the risk that it may need to sell BTC at a loss. Since Trump’s election victory in November 2024, Strategy has purchased 275,965 BTC at an average price of $93,228. Strategy currently holds 528,185 BTC purchased at an average price of $67,458 per Bitcoin, facing an unrealized loss of $4.6 billion. *This is not investment advice.

43113959,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=147685,1744186209,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Crypto Embezzlement: Korean Banker Faces 20-Year Sentence in Woori Bank Scandal,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/korean-banker-crypto-embezzlement-sentence/,"In a stunning turn of events that has sent ripples through both the traditional finance and cryptocurrency worlds, a former South Korean banker is facing a potential 20-year prison sentence. Why? For allegedly embezzling a staggering 17.7 billion won, equivalent to $12 million, all in the pursuit of cryptocurrency investment gains. Let’s dive into the details of this audacious case that highlights the intersection of traditional banking vulnerabilities and the allure of the digital asset market. Unmasking the Crypto Embezzlement Scheme Imagine the audacity – leveraging your position within a reputable institution to siphon off millions for personal gain, and then channeling it into the volatile world of cryptocurrency investment . This is precisely what South Korean prosecutors are accusing a former Woori Bank employee of doing. According to reports from Yonhap news agency, the prosecution is seeking a hefty 20-year jail term for this individual, escalating from an initial 15-year sentence requested in the first trial. But how did this elaborate scheme unfold? The Accused: A former employee of Woori Bank, a prominent South Korean financial institution. The Crime: Embezzlement of 17.7 billion won ($12 million) through fraudulent loans. The Method: Securing loans under the names of 17 unsuspecting customers – both individuals and businesses. Scale of Operation: A total of 35 separate loan transactions were executed between July 2023 and May 2024. The Motive: A significant portion of the embezzled funds was funneled into cryptocurrency investment . Why a 20-Year Sentence for Crypto Investments Gone Wrong? The prosecution’s push for a 20-year sentence might seem severe to some, but it underscores the gravity of financial crimes, especially those involving abuse of trust and significant sums. Let’s consider the factors that could be influencing this request for a harsher penalty in this Korean banker case: Magnitude of Embezzlement: $12 million is a substantial amount, impacting not only the bank but potentially the customers whose names were misused. Abuse of Trust: Bankers hold positions of immense trust, managing and safeguarding people’s finances. This breach of trust is a significant aggravating factor. Premeditation and Planning: Executing 35 fraudulent transactions across multiple customers and businesses over almost a year indicates a calculated and sustained criminal effort, not a momentary lapse in judgment. Impact on Financial System: Such cases can erode public confidence in the banking system and financial institutions as a whole. Deterrent Effect: A harsh sentence can serve as a strong deterrent to others within the financial sector who might be tempted to engage in similar activities, especially as the lure of quick profits in areas like cryptocurrency investment grows. The Allure and Peril of Cryptocurrency Investment This case shines a spotlight on the captivating, yet often risky, world of cryptocurrency investment . Cryptocurrencies, with their potential for high returns, have attracted individuals from all walks of life, including, as this case tragically illustrates, those within the traditional financial system. But what makes crypto so alluring, and where does the peril lie? Aspect Cryptocurrency Investment: Allure Cryptocurrency Investment: Peril Potential Returns High volatility offers the chance for rapid and significant financial gains. High volatility also means the risk of substantial and rapid losses. Market crashes can wipe out investments quickly. Decentralization & Innovation The decentralized nature and innovative technology appeal to those seeking alternatives to traditional finance. Lack of regulation and nascent technology can lead to scams, fraud, and market manipulation. Accessibility Cryptocurrencies are often accessible to a wider range of investors, including those in emerging markets. Complexity and lack of understanding can lead to poor investment decisions and increased risk. Anonymity (Pseudonymity) Some cryptocurrencies offer a degree of anonymity, which can be attractive for various reasons. Anonymity can also be exploited for illicit activities, including money laundering and funding of illegal operations. Woori Bank and the Broader Implications for Korean Banking The fact that this crypto embezzlement incident occurred at Woori Bank, a major financial institution in South Korea, raises questions about internal controls and security protocols within the banking sector. While this appears to be an isolated incident involving a rogue employee, it inevitably prompts scrutiny. What are the broader implications for Korean banking? 강화된 내부 통제 (Kanghwadoen Naebu Tongje) – Strengthened Internal Controls: Korean banks may need to reassess and bolster their internal control mechanisms to prevent similar incidents. This could include enhanced monitoring of employee activities, stricter loan approval processes, and more robust fraud detection systems. 직원 교육 강화 (Jigwon Gyoyuk Ganghwa) – Enhanced Employee Training: Banks might invest more in employee training focused on ethical conduct, fraud awareness, and the risks associated with new asset classes like cryptocurrencies. 기술적 보안 강화 (Gisuljeok Boan Ganghwa) – Enhanced Technological Security: Implementing advanced technological solutions to detect and prevent fraudulent activities is crucial. This could involve AI-powered monitoring and blockchain-based transaction tracking for certain operations. 규제 강화 가능성 (Gyuje Ganghwa Ganeungseong) – Potential for Regulatory Scrutiny: Regulators may increase their oversight of banks’ cryptocurrency-related risk management and compliance procedures. This could lead to stricter regulations and reporting requirements for financial institutions dealing with digital assets, even indirectly through employee actions. Actionable Insights: Lessons from this Crypto Embezzlement Case While this news story unfolds in South Korea, the lessons are globally relevant, especially for anyone involved in or considering cryptocurrency investment , as well as for financial institutions worldwide. What actionable insights can we glean? For Investors: Understand the Risks: This case is a stark reminder of the volatility and risks inherent in cryptocurrency markets. Never invest more than you can afford to lose, and conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions. For Financial Institutions: Bolster Security: Banks and financial institutions must prioritize robust internal controls and employee oversight to prevent fraud and abuse, especially as employees may be drawn to the allure of new asset classes. For Regulators: Adapt and Evolve: Regulatory frameworks need to evolve to keep pace with the rapidly changing financial landscape, including the integration of digital assets. Clear guidelines and proactive monitoring are essential. For Individuals: Ethical Conduct Matters: Regardless of the potential for financial gain, ethical conduct and adherence to the law are paramount. The consequences of financial crimes can be devastating, as this Korean banker is now discovering. Conclusion: A Grim Warning from the Crypto World The case of the Korean banker facing a 20-year sentence for crypto embezzlement serves as a grim warning. It underscores the potential for financial crime to infiltrate even established institutions and highlights the intoxicating, yet perilous, nature of cryptocurrency investment . As the digital asset space continues to mature and intertwine with traditional finance, vigilance, robust security measures, and ethical conduct are more critical than ever. This scandal serves as a potent reminder that the pursuit of quick riches can lead to devastating consequences, both for individuals and the broader financial system. Justice, in this case, seems to be leaning towards a severe penalty, sending a clear message about the consequences of such audacious financial crimes.

Over $25.7 billion was erased from leveraged ETFs in two trading sessions, which recorded the worst outflow on record for such high-risk instruments, as per the Financial Times. This marked decline resulted from increased trade barriers under the Trump administration by implementing broad-ranging “reciprocal” tariffs that prompted selloffs in both traditional and digital markets. These include a 104% tariff on products from China that raised the possibility of a long-term economic slump and opportunities for global stock market instability. Leveraged ETFs, which can generally mimic the index’s performance with up to five times the daily returns, suffered the most. These products have become popular among retail traders seeking high returns on their investments but have shown significant weakness during macroeconomic upheavals. As Elisabeth Kashner noted, these are “very sharp knives,” and one needs to be very careful while using them. “They are to be used for very specific purposes, and the people that use them have to know what they are doing,” she said. Single-stock leveraged funds hit hard Some of the most severe declines in single-stock futures took place in the course of the two-day crash. The Ireland-listed Leverage Shares 4x Long Semiconductors ETP suffered the biggest loss, a decrease of more than 59%. Other leveraged funds, such as the Boeing, Arm Holdings, and Magnificent 7 technology stock funds, also fell by more than 50%. Nasdaq-tracking ProShares UltraPro QQQ was the biggest loser with $20 billion assets under management. It shed $6.3 billion during the same period, which indicates that the tech sector is rather vulnerable to macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. The ETF market’s collapse eclipsed previous selloffs, such as the pandemic panic in March 2020 and the “Volmageddon” volatility of 2018. Analysts also pointed out that some U.S. listed ETFs using leverage cannot be leveraged more than 3x their positions. At the same time, their counterparts in other markets can have more leverage, leading to much higher losses. Bitcoin could benefit from global economic stress While leveraged ETFs have struggled, analysts anticipate a recovery for Bitcoin (BTC) as other factors come into play. Although short-term declines led to BTC testing the $76,000 mark, experts have pointed to macroeconomic factors that may uphold Bitcoin’s status as a safe-haven asset. Binance CEO Richard Teng claimed that Bitcoin might rise because it is a haven for investors who are in search of other safe assets. He noted the resilience of BTC’s long-term holders and stated that short-term fluctuations could help spur further adoption of BTC and other coins. “This environment could also accelerate interest in crypto as a non-sovereign store of value,” Teng noted. Bitwise’s Head of Investment, Matt Hougan, agreed with this view. He noted that a declined dollar, which the imbalances in trade may expect, can cause an increase in Bitcoin prices in the short term. Hougan saw a prospect in the future towards a more diversified system reserve. “Hard money like bitcoin and gold [may] play a bigger role than it does today,” he told investors. VanEck’s Head of Digital Assets Research, Matthew Sigel, also chimed in and stated that the action taken by the Fed in addressing the economic drag from the tariffs might lead to a boost in cryptocurrencies. If inflation is controlled, the cuts can bring back the familiar conditions of high liquidity, traditionally favorable for Bitcoin’s growth. However, even in the face of chaos, Trump did not appear to be changing his approach. Although he described the tariffs as “permanent,” he also said they were putting pressure on counterparts to enter into negotiations. His unpredictability has really caused more confusion in the already volatile markets. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

If Trump’s Tariff mess was not enough, new rumors recently suggested that Strategy might sell its Bitcoin if prices drop further, based on an 8-K filing with the SEC on April 7, which might create a massive liquidation fear. However, this statement turns out to be a routine risk disclosure, not a new or urgent development. The same warning has appeared in previous filings, including the Q1 2024 10-Q report and even reports from 2023 and earlier. It’s a standard precaution, not a sign that Strategy is about to break its long-standing Bitcoin “ HODL ” strategy. However, this goes against michael saylor michael saylor Michael Saylor is a Co-founder of Strategy formerly MicroStrategy. Before founding Microstrategy, he was a rocket scientist and studied aeronautics and astronautics at MIT on an Air Force scholarship. He dubs Bitcoin 'Digital Gold'.

He’s even said he would pass on his Bitcoin to pro-crypto causes after his death. But a recent SEC filing suggests that this long-standing pledge may soon face real-world pressure. STRATEGY MAY BE FORCED TO SELL BITCOIN, BREAKING 'HODL' PLEDGE In a recent 8-K filing with the SEC, Strategy may be forced to sell its #Bitcoin to meet debt obligations if $BTC prices continue to decline – potentially breaking Michael Saylor’s @saylor long-standing ""never… pic.twitter.com/GfLPMmd2SP — Cult of Blockchain (@BlockchainCult) April 9, 2025 What the SEC Filing Reveals According to Strategy’s 8-K filing , the company may be forced to sell some or even all of its Bitcoin if market conditions worsen or if it can’t secure favorable financing. The document highlights that since Bitcoin makes up most of Strategy’s assets, a significant price drop could put the company’s ability to meet its financial obligations at risk. If equity or debt funding isn’t available on good terms, selling Bitcoin might be the only option. The filing bluntly states, “We may be required to sell Bitcoin to justify our financial obligations,” possibly “at prices below our cost basis or that are otherwise unfavorable.” While this doesn’t necessarily mean a permanent exit from BTC, it would go against the “forever hold” narrative Saylor has pushed for years. A Huge Bitcoin Stash at Risk Just recently, on March 31, Strategy acquired another 22,048 BTC worth $1.91 billion, funded through a $711 million preferred stock offering. That brought their total stash to a staggering 582,185 BTC, currently valued at over $46.5 billion. Despite such bullish moves, the company is now under pressure due to recent market swings and tightening financial conditions. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Crypto Market is Down?

Still, with BTC price volatility and financial obligations weighing heavy, Strategy may soon have to make an uncomfortable decision. For now, no new Bitcoin purchases have been announced, and all eyes are on whether Saylor’s “never sell” vow will truly hold up under pressure. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

At the center of everything is Donald Trump Jr., advised Kalshi. Nevada and New Jersey have issued cease-and-desist orders against Kalshi over the prediction market's sports contracts , claiming they violate state gambling laws. But Kalshi has hit back, arguing that what it offers isn't gambling and that it's regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Commodities Exchange Act as it is a prediction market, not a gambling venue – an argument that crypto attorney Aaron Brogan says should be an easy win in court. ""I think clearly Kalshi is going to win these cases,"" Brogan said in an interview with CoinDesk. ""If you look at the language of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), it says that the CFTC has exclusive jurisdiction over any contracts that fall within its regulatory purview, which derivative contracts and event contracts clearly do."" Prediction markets like Kalshi and Polymarket operate as neutral intermediaries, matching orders just like any other exchange under CFTC purview. There's no sportsbook with a prediction market; the operator of the market doesn't bet against its users. For prediction market operators, sports has been a significant growth area. Data from Polymarket Analytics shows the category has surpassed the 2024 election for volume. ""[Kalshi is] not taking a side of the bet as the market in that case, which fundamentally changes the incentives involved and makes the product different in a holistic way,” Brogan explained. Kalshi has self-certified these event contracts with the CFTC , a process allowing federally regulated derivatives exchanges to list new products by attesting their compliance with regulatory requirements without needing explicit pre-approval from the agency. For its part, the CFTC seems to be receptive to the argument that the outcomes of sports games are commodities, with President Donald Trump's pick to run the commission , Brian Quintenz, arguing in 2021 that they can serve a legitimate economic purpose as hedging instruments, distinct from pure betting activities, and thus should not automatically be prohibited under the CEA. Brogan recognizes the reasoning behind Nevada's concerns, given the state's historical reliance on gambling revenues. However, he points out that Nevada's actions against Kalshi could inadvertently raise serious questions about the legitimacy of Nevada's own gambling markets. By categorizing Kalshi's federally regulated event contracts as gambling, Nevada regulators have unintentionally highlighted that their own state-approved gambling operations, such as sports betting markets and other event-based wagering, might themselves technically qualify as derivative contracts. “In that case, federal preemption could theoretically crowd out state authority to oversee those gambling markets at all,” said Brogan. A victory for Kalshi, said Brogan, could transform American sports betting culture entirely if it's done through prediction markets instead of traditional gambling companies. Brogan notes that if Kalshi prevails, states could respond politically or legally, possibly lobbying Congress or filing an Administrative Procedure Act claim against the CFTC, although he doubts such challenges would succeed. Ultimately, Kalshi’s litigation against state regulators presents a landmark federalism dilemma: Can states retain traditional authority over gambling regulation, or will federal regulatory frameworks dominate in the digital age? ""This is incredibly complicated,"" Brogan concluded, ""and we're right on the cusp of litigation that could definitively define who will predominate. It's complex, but it's going to be really important.""",Policy|Las Vegas|Nevada|Kalshi,EN,0,0,COMMODITY|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-09 08:17:03

This decline also led to a selloff in U.S. treasuries, pushing 30-year yields higher and raising economic concerns. Meanwhile, this could cause a major liquidity crisis if Bitcoin drops below $74,000; $476 million could be liquidated. If it rises above $78,000, short sellers may lose $982 million. 30-Year Treasury Yields Jump to 4.98% The recent implementation of global tariffs under Donald Trump has created uncertainty in financial markets. As a result, 30-year U.S. treasury yields have risen above 4.98%, showing growing worries about inflation and government debt. Historically, bonds are considered a safe haven, but the sudden spike in yields signals potential instability, leading to investor anxiety across asset classes, including Bitcoin. Some analysts believe this selloff may have been triggered by forced liquidations from major financial players rather than a natural market movement. Financial analyst Jim Bianco pointed out this sharp market change in an X post, comparing it to a similar bond market shift in 1982 when interest rates were much higher. He believes sudden moves like this are usually caused by large liquidations rather than normal trading. Something has broken tonight in the bond market. We are seeing a disorderly liquidation. If I had to GUESS, the basis trade is in full unwind. Since Friday's close to now … the 30-year yield is up 56 bps, in three trading days. The last time this yield rose this much in 3… pic.twitter.com/IS6qog4uog — Jim Bianco (@biancoresearch) April 9, 2025 Bitcoin’s Liquidity Crisis Looms With Bitcoin hovering around key technical levels, traders are bracing for potential market volatility. According to data from Coinglass , if Bitcoin slips below $74,000, the market could see a significant wave of long liquidations, causing further price declines. On the other hand, if Bitcoin breaks past $78,000, short traders could suffer nearly $1 billion in liquidations, leading to another sharp move in the market. Long-Term Outlook: Buy The Dip! Despite short-term uncertainty, some analysts see this dip as a buying opportunity. Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research, believes that if market conditions stabilize and pro-crypto policies emerge, Bitcoin could surge to $95,000–$100,000 by late 2025, pushing the crypto market’s total value beyond $3 trillion again. As of now, Bitcoin is trading around $77,670 , reflecting a drop of 2% in the last 24 hours, with a market cap hitting $1.54 trillion.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-09 08:17:52

In a new CNBC interview, Gundlach says he sees the S&P 500 stock index falling by around 14% from the current level. “So I think investors need to stay on defensive mode. We certainly are positioned for that. And the extent to which investors hold cash, I would continue to do that until we get something more of a sustained bottom. As I said earlier, I’m looking for 4,500 on the S&P [500 index].” According to the billionaire investor who earned the nickname “Bond King” due to his success in the bond market after the 2008 financial crisis, the market uncertainty caused by the imposition of import tariffs in the US is going to persist for the foreseeable future as a quick resolution is unlikely. “People talked about tariffs [getting] delayed. There is no way that’s going to happen. I think [US President Donald] Trump is going to keep this going. And I don’t understand exactly how he calculates or the administration calculates this strange formula to set these tariffs. It just doesn’t seem to make much sense to me mathematically. But at least it’s a formula. Whether it’s logical or not, it’s a formula. Otherwise, it’s just going to be totally arbitrary. But he’s [Trump] keeping people guessing. And he’s not going to back down. I don’t think so. So this is something that’s going to have to play out and we’re going to be dealing with this, I would say certainly for weeks or months and not just days.” The S&P 500 index is trading at 5,222 at time of writing, down by over 10% since the start of the year. ?

They Just Clashed Again,https://cryptopotato.com/is-the-ripple-vs-sec-lawsuit-really-over-they-just-clashed-again/,"TL;DR Ripple’s legal saga with the SEC continues, with a recent filing from Justin W. Keener sparking further intrigue. Some predict that a resolution of the latest dispute could trigger a rally for XRP, but this remains quite uncertain. Confronting on This Front The lengthy lawsuit between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) seemingly reached its official conclusion last month when the agency dropped its appeal against the firm. However, sporadic developments on the case continue to pop up. Several days ago, popular journalist Eleanor Terrett informed about “an odd” filing in the Ripple v SEC docket. The court document, coming from a person called Justin W. Keener, represents “an emergency request” to Judge Analisa Torres to “present decisive evidence in favor of the defendants and in favor of liberty for the American people.” The filing didn’t specify how the evidence helps Ripple, but it hints at a link to physical investment contracts he has been gathering. Meanwhile, the SEC recently sued Keener for acting as an unregistered penny stock dealer, and the court ordered him to pay $10 million in penalties. Most recently, Terrett revealed that the Commission filed an opposition to that “emergency request.” The agency is against the motion due to three main reasons. First, it claimed that the District Court lacked jurisdiction over the request as the lawsuit had already moved to the Second Circuit. Second, it argued that Keener did not file a proper motion to intervene . Lastly, it labeled the filing as “unnecessary” because “Ripple is competent enough to decide on its own whether the evidence in question could help its case.” “For those reasons, the SEC is asking Judge Torres to deny the request entirely,” Terrett’s statement concludes. XRP’ Big Move ‘ on the Way? The latest on the Ripple v. SEC front garnered the attention of many industry participants, with some predicting that a court denial of the agency’s request could cause a price rally for XRP. However, the major developments in the legal tussle have already occurred, and the event seems priced in. The Ripple community now awaits the potential approval of a spot XRP ETF in America or a renewed bull run for the cryptocurrency market, which are more likely to trigger an upswing for the underlying token. As of this writing, the coin’s price hovers at around $1.80 (per CoinGecko’s data), representing a whopping 47% decline compared to the local top of almost $3.40 in mid-January.

Furthermore, there’s been a strong rumor circulating that the firm might be forced to sell its BTC holdings if the crypto market correction doesn’t stop anytime soon. Prominent crypto analyst Doctor Profit issued a stark warning to Michael Saylor, the co-founder and executive chairman of MicroStrategy (now Strategy), regarding the company’s significant Bitcoin holdings. Highlighting concerns about Bitcoin’s current price trajectory, the analyst noted that Bitcoin is now only 10% above MicroStrategy’s average buying price of $67,485. Just as the firm sits on a massive $40 billion Bitcoin stash, investors are turning more and more anxious. “Let me predict it straight: MSTR will most likely be sold to avoid liquidation,” added Doctor Profit . The analyst further stated: “Dear Michael Saylor, you are most likely becoming the next victim of this market. I would start selling as much BTC as I could in your case.” MicroStrategy (MSTR) Stock Under Pressure Amid Liquidation Risks MicroStrategy (MSTR) stock has come under severe selling pressure, correcting over 20% over the past week. This comes as the Trump tariff war escalates, sending the global markets on a tailsping, coupled with the Bitcoin price correction to $75,000. Furthermore, there’s been a strong rumour that Michael Saylor’s firm has submitted 8-K form with the SEC on April 7, warning that a continued decline in Bitcoin’s price could compel the company to sell its Bitcoin holdings to repay debts. As of press time, BTC price is trading 2.52% down at $77,307 with a market cap of $1.534 trillion. However, upon closer examination, the statement in question appears to be part of standard risk disclosure practices. The firm has been using the language in all of its reports during the previous 10 quarters, including the Q1 2024 filing and reports from 2023 and earlier. Thus, this disclosure isn’t specific to the current market conditions but rather reflects a broader acknowledgment of potential risks associated with the company’s Bitcoin-heavy strategy. Despite the 11.26% drop to $237 on Tuesday, the MSTR stock has surged by 3.29% in the after-hour trading session. The stock is closely flirting around its 200-DMA, a long-term support level, and falling under this could trigger severe correction.

This has led to a huge 21% fall in the S&P 500 from top to bottom. Perhaps now in the eye of the storm, Bitcoin bulls are battling to keep the king of the cryptocurrencies afloat. Will they succeed? A whopping 104% tariff on some Chinese goods is now in effect. The extra 50% levy on certain Chinese imports was applied as China announced its own reciprocal like-for-like imposition of 34% on what the US had previously levied on China. With the US/China trade war now going full scale, Europe being forced to react to a 20% levy, and various other countries deciding what to do with the tariffs imposed against them, global economies are in a heightened state of disorder and uncertainty. S&P 500 forming a bottom? Source: TradingView In the US, the S&P 500 has now dropped a total of 21%, and has bounced from the very strong $4,800 horizontal support. Will there be a bottom made here, or is the global tariffs war going to force the price even lower? U.S. 10-year bond yields spike back Source: TradingView A real problem for U.S. treasury secretary Bessent right now is how 10 yr bond yields have spiked back up, after initially starting to cave. The 10 year bond yield is what is used as a baseline for refinancing the current $7 trillion or so of maturing debt in 2025, and as such, getting the yield lower is an absolute priority. Nevertheless, the above chart is showing that the 10 year yield could get even uglier, and is suggesting that money is still not trusting longer duration government bonds as a flight to safety. Bitcoin still plumbing the depths Source: TradingView Among all the financial and geopolitical turmoil is Bitcoin (BTC) . Even though it could be argued that it is a non-government aligned asset, and therefore should hold value in this environment, it is still being sold off, and is in danger of going back to test the top of the last bull market at $69,000, designated by the orange line at the bottom of the chart. As things stand, it does rather look like the price could continue to fall to this very strong $69,000 horizontal support. If it does so, this level must hold, or things could get really ugly. One good and one bad indicator for $BTC macro picture Source: TradingView The weekly chart for $BTC shows a couple of good and bad indicators. The good is that the price is still respecting the 50 simple moving average (SMA), and it can be seen that this has been the case throughout the bull market so far. On the bad side, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is showing that the indicator is shaping to move below the very influential 44.00 level. This level has held support and resistance over Bitcoin’s entire existence, and so it is extremely important that it is held. There are still a few days to go before the week is up, and the indicator confirms above or below. This is well worth keeping an eye on.

He also said that he had a recent conversation with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who separately stated that he urged Trump to reconsider tariff policies that took effect last week. Trump’s decision to impose a 25% tariff on auto imports and a 24% duty on other Japanese goods is expected to significantly impact Japan’s export-driven economy, with analysts warning it could shave up to 0.8% off the country’s economic growth. Japan sends government officials in an attempt to counter Trump’s recent tariff policies Officials whose identities were concealed due to internal policies revealed that two top government officials sent to the U.S. to set the stage for future tariff talks included a senior deputy minister at Japan’s Foreign Ministry, Takeshi Akahori, and a vice minister for international affairs at Japan’s Trade Ministry, Takehiko Matsuo, who are currently in the United States. Moreover, these officials highlighted that the visit was part of Tokyo’s initial efforts to prepare for the crucial trade negotiations between U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and Japan’s Economic Revitalization Minister Ryosei Akazawa. However, the officials did not mention the date or time when Akazawa will be in the U.S. for negotiations. Akazawa is among the Japanese officials trying to secure a reprieve against Trump’s tariff policies. In support of this, just recently, during a parliamentary session, Akazawa stated that the government will keep requesting that the U.S. reconsider its decisions. In addition, in a statement, he asserted that they would think about what would benefit their country and which of their many options would work best. Although the details of the negotiations are unclear, Japan might be relieved to have at least a seat at the negotiating table early. Additionally, another factor that relieved Japan was the U.S. secretary of the treasury’s statement that among the numerous trading partners requesting a reprieve from the tariffs, Bessent stated that he anticipated Japan to be preferred. In a recent interview, he highlighted the U.S.’s strong economic ties with various key allies but pointed to Japan’s swift and proactive engagement as a reason it might be prioritized. Meanwhile, as the U.S. escalates its trade war with China, President Donald Trump signaled a positive outlook on reaching a trade agreement with South Korea, suggesting that Washington is placing strategic importance on its Asian allies. Ishiba presses Trump to rethink tariffs as U.S.–Japan trade tensions rise On April 7, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said he called U.S. President Donald Trump, told him that his tariff policies were very disappointing, and asked him to reconsider. Following the call with Trump, Ishiba informed reporters: “I’ve told the President that Japan has been the biggest investor in the United States for five straight years, and the tariff policies could hurt Japanese companies’ investment capabilities.” Additionally, Ishiba stated that they had agreed to appoint ministers to lead the talks and to continue constructive dialogue on the matter during the 25-minute call . In the meantime, in a post on his social media accounts, Trump mentioned the call with Ishiba, highlighting the “tough but fair” tariff parameters being set. Moreover, he highlighted several accusations toward Japan, including that Japan had been inconsiderate to the United States’ terms of trade, taking millions of their vehicles but not theirs, and that the same applied to agriculture, among many other “things.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

It’s not just market volatility; the traditional finance world is sending signals that could significantly impact your digital asset portfolio. The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield, a benchmark for safe investments, has just surged to 4.439%, reaching levels not seen since late February. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors, this isn’t just another economic data point – it’s a potential shift in the investment landscape. Let’s dive deep into what this means for the crypto sphere and how you can navigate these potentially turbulent waters. What Does the Soaring US 10-Year Yield Mean for the Crypto Market? The US 10-year yield is essentially the return you get from investing in a U.S. government bond for 10 years. It’s considered a ‘risk-free’ rate of return because the U.S. government is highly unlikely to default. When this yield rises, it becomes more attractive for investors to park their money in these safe-haven assets. Why is this crucial for the crypto market ? Risk-Off Sentiment Intensifies: A higher Treasury yield signals a growing ‘risk-off’ sentiment. Investors become more risk-averse, preferring the guaranteed returns of government bonds over the volatility associated with cryptocurrencies. This can lead to capital flowing out of the crypto market and into safer assets. Increased Borrowing Costs: The 10-year yield influences borrowing costs across the economy. Higher yields can translate to increased interest rates for loans, making it more expensive for companies to borrow and invest. This can indirectly dampen overall economic activity and potentially affect investment in all sectors, including crypto. Opportunity Cost Rises: With a more appealing return from safe investment options like Treasury bonds, the opportunity cost of investing in riskier assets like cryptocurrencies increases. Investors may re-evaluate their portfolios, shifting funds from crypto to bonds to capitalize on higher, safer yields. Asset Class Typical Risk Level Impact of Rising 10-Year Yield U.S. 10-Year Treasury Bond Low Increased Attractiveness Cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.) High Decreased Attractiveness Stocks Medium to High Potentially Negative Impact Why is the 10-Year Treasury Yield a Key Indicator? The Treasury yield curve, particularly the 10-year yield, is often seen as a barometer of economic health and investor confidence. Here’s why it holds such significance: Benchmark for Mortgages and Loans: The 10-year yield serves as a benchmark for various interest rates, including mortgages, corporate bonds, and other loans. Changes in this yield can have ripple effects throughout the financial system. Inflation Expectations: The 10-year yield can reflect market expectations about future inflation. If investors anticipate higher inflation, they will demand a higher yield to compensate for the erosion of purchasing power over time. Economic Growth Outlook: A rising 10-year yield can sometimes indicate expectations of stronger economic growth, as investors anticipate higher returns on investments. However, in the current context, it may also reflect concerns about inflation and potential monetary policy tightening by the Federal Reserve. Safe Haven Asset Status: In times of economic uncertainty or geopolitical instability, investors often flock to U.S. Treasury bonds as a safe haven, driving down yields. Conversely, when risk appetite increases, yields tend to rise as investors move towards riskier assets. Navigating the Investment Options Landscape Amidst Rising Yields So, what actionable insights can crypto investors glean from this situation? It’s crucial to understand that a rising US 10-year yield doesn’t necessarily spell doom for the crypto market , but it does warrant a recalibration of strategies and risk assessment. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors: Re-evaluate Risk Tolerance: Assess your personal risk tolerance. Are you comfortable holding onto your crypto assets through potential market fluctuations, or is it time to reduce exposure and diversify into less volatile assets? Diversification is Key: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your portfolio across different asset classes, including traditional assets like bonds and stocks, to mitigate risk. Monitor Economic Indicators: Stay informed about macroeconomic indicators, including inflation data, Federal Reserve policy announcements, and Treasury yield movements. These factors can provide clues about the direction of the market. Focus on Long-Term Fundamentals: In times of market uncertainty, it’s beneficial to refocus on the long-term fundamentals of your crypto investments. Consider the technology, adoption rates, and real-world use cases of the projects you’ve invested in. Consider Stablecoins and Cash Positions: In a risk-off sentiment environment, holding a portion of your portfolio in stablecoins or cash can provide a buffer and allow you to capitalize on potential buying opportunities if crypto prices decline. Is This a Crypto Winter Warning? While the rising US 10-year yield creates headwinds for the crypto market , it’s not necessarily a definitive sign of another ‘crypto winter’. The crypto market is influenced by a multitude of factors, including technological advancements, regulatory developments, institutional adoption, and global economic conditions. However, it does suggest a period of increased caution and potentially higher volatility. Investors should be prepared for continued market fluctuations and adopt a more discerning approach to investment options . Conclusion: Navigating the Shifting Sands of Investment The climb of the US 10-year yield to its highest point since February is a significant development that crypto investors cannot afford to ignore. It underscores a broader shift in risk-off sentiment and highlights the interconnectedness of traditional finance and the burgeoning digital asset space. By understanding the implications of these yield movements, diversifying strategically, and staying informed, crypto investors can navigate these shifting sands and position themselves for long-term success, even amidst market volatility. The key is to remain vigilant, adaptable, and informed in this ever-evolving financial landscape.

According to an April 8 report by local news outlet Buenos Aires Times, deputies in the lower house voted 128 to 93 in favor, with seven abstentions. The same proposal previously failed to move forward in the Senate. The news follows Milei promoting the LIBRA memecoin on social media . With the Argentine president leveraging his credibility as a government official and his 3.8 million followers, the token quickly reached $5, briefly touching a market cap of $4 billion. Milei has since faced accusations of wrongdoing, with critics claiming that LIBRA was a rug-pull scam and that he lured investors in. Lawyer Jonatan Baldiviezo, alongside Marcos Zelaya, engineer María Eva Koutsovitis and economist Claudio Lozano, a former head of Argentina’s central bank, filed a lawsuit against Milei, accusing him of fraud . Related: KIP Protocol reveals involvement in Javier Milei-endorsed Libra rug pull A presidential-scale disaster According to Baldiviezo, Milei’s promotion was instrumental in an “illicit association” with the promoters of the cryptocurrency. The non-governmental organization Observatorio del Derecho a la Ciudad shared the concerns and filed a case that accused the president of promoting a scheme that reportedly resulted in over 40,000 investors losing more than $4 billion. February onchain data showed that the hardest hit investors of the LIBRA memecoin pump and dump scheme lost a combined $251 million . Blockchain data shows that of the 15,430 wallets that sold at a profit or loss of more than $1,000, over 86% of those sold at a loss, resulting in a total of $251 million lost. Despite numerous sources showing his social media posts, in mid-February, Milei denied claims that he promoted LIBRA. He said at the time: “I did not promote that. What I did, I spread the word.” Related: Javier Milei risks impeachment after endorsing $107M Libra rug pull A reported family business One of the creators behind the controversial Libra crypto token reportedly sent a text message bragging about being able to pay Argentine President Javier Milei’s sister in exchange for the president sharing the memecoin’s details on social media. According to February reports, Hayden Davis — a person connected to the project — sent a message to a crypto investment firm executive saying that he could pay Karina Milei for “control” over the Argentine president: “We can also have Milei tweet and meet in person and do promo.

According to a court order made public on April 8, Judge Federico Moreno gave the green light to the deal, which sets aside up to $11 million for eligible buyers and includes $2.9 million in attorney fees. The case, led by plaintiff Daniel Harper, covered anyone who bought Astrals NFTs between May 2022 and Jan. 15 or picked up the project’s GLXY tokens during that time. The lawsuit, first filed in May 2023 , accused O’Neal of using his celebrity status to promote the Astrals NFT project, a Solana-based collection of 10,000 digital collectibles tied to a virtual world concept, where users could socialize and play with others, including the basketball star. Per the complaint, during the height of the NFT boom, O’Neal was active in the Astrals Discord, even posting the infamous “I’m not f***ing leaving” meme to rally holders, a moment also cited in court documents. But as the market soured in 2022 and 2023, the hype died down, and O’Neal allegedly distanced himself from the project, leaving many investors frustrated and stuck with sharply devalued assets.

O’Neal reached a settlement agreement in November, following months of legal back-and-forth. The court acknowledged last year that the suit had a viable claim, suggesting the NBA Hall of Famer was a direct seller of the tokens. This isn’t the first time Shaq has faced heat in the crypto world. He’s also part of an ongoing lawsuit related to his promotional work for FTX, the now-defunct crypto exchange. At the time, lawyers reportedly struggled to serve him court papers for months, eventually catching up with him during a Miami Heat playoff game in May 2023, held at the former FTX Arena.

According to a notice posted on April 9, the crypto exchange declared that it will delist multiple spot trading pairs, with a majority of the spot trading pairs being tied to Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Binance Coin ( BNB ). Starting from April 11 at 03:00 UTC, Binance will no longer support trading for ACT/BRL, ALPHA/BTC, BLUR/BTC, CELR/BTC, PENGU/BNB, POND/BTC, and RUNE/BNB. At the same time, the crypto exchange will also terminate spot trading bot services for the spot trading pairs mentioned in the announcement. Therefore, traders should update or cancel their spot trading bots that are linked to the pairs before the delisting date to avoid suffering potential losses. Shortly after the announcement was published, the tokens included in the delisted spot trading pairs still saw modest gains for the most part.

While the reasons behind the decision to delist each spot trading pair is not clearly stated, the exchange cited it was due to “multiple factors, such as poor liquidity and trading volume.” These factors were discovered during the internal team’s periodic reviews of the listed spot trading pairs. The delisting announcement comes just a few days after the team behind ACT announced that it would be launching an investigation into the token’s sharp price drop on Binance.

It’s also about gauging the collective mood of the market. Right now, that mood is decidedly fearful, according to the latest Crypto Fear & Greed Index . This crucial metric, designed to capture the emotional temperature of the crypto market, has taken another plunge, falling to 18 and firmly remaining in the dreaded ‘Extreme Fear’ zone. What does this mean for you, and should you be worried? Let’s dive deep into what’s driving this sentiment and how to interpret these signals. Decoding the Crypto Fear and Greed Index: A Sentiment Thermometer Think of the Crypto Fear and Greed Index as a sentiment thermometer for the cryptocurrency market. It’s not about predicting the future with certainty, but rather about providing a snapshot of the prevailing emotions driving investor behavior. Developed by Alternative, a software development platform, this index synthesizes various market data points into a single, easy-to-understand number ranging from 0 to 100. Here’s a simple breakdown: 0-24: Extreme Fear – This zone typically suggests investors are excessively worried, often leading to potential undervaluation of crypto assets and possible buying opportunities for the brave. 25-49: Fear – Indicates a cautious market sentiment where investors are apprehensive about potential downturns. 50-74: Greed – Signals growing optimism and enthusiasm in the market, potentially leading to price increases. 75-100: Extreme Greed – This zone often points to a market bubble, where excessive optimism can drive prices to unsustainable levels, increasing the risk of a correction. Currently, with the index at 18, we are firmly entrenched in ‘Extreme Fear.’ This isn’t just a slight dip; it’s a strong signal that market participants are feeling significantly uneasy. But what fuels this fear? What Drives the ‘Extreme Fear’ in Crypto Market Sentiment? The Crypto Fear and Greed Index isn’t based on gut feelings or hunches. It’s a data-driven metric that considers six key factors, each contributing to the overall score: Volatility (25%): Measures the current and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin, comparing it with the corresponding average values of the last 30 and 90 days. High volatility often triggers fear as it indicates price instability and uncertainty. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Compares the current market momentum and trading volume with the 30 and 90-day averages. Weakening momentum and lower volume can suggest a lack of conviction and increased fear. Social Media (15%): Analyzes sentiment on social media platforms, primarily Twitter, for crypto-related hashtags. A high volume of negative sentiment naturally contributes to a lower index reading, indicating fear. Surveys (15%): Although currently paused, historically, weekly crypto polls gauged investor sentiment directly. These surveys provided a direct measure of fear or greed among crypto traders and investors. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Measures Bitcoin’s market capitalization relative to the total cryptocurrency market. Increased Bitcoin dominance can sometimes indicate a ‘flight to safety’ as investors move away from riskier altcoins during fearful times. Google Trends (10%): Analyzes Google Trends data for Bitcoin-related search queries. Spikes in searches like ‘Bitcoin crash’ can indicate fear and panic in the market. The current ‘Extreme Fear’ reading suggests that a combination of these factors is contributing to the negative market sentiment . It’s likely we are seeing heightened volatility, weakened momentum, and negative social media discussions all playing a role. Navigating Crypto Volatility in Times of Extreme Fear Crypto volatility is inherent to the market, but periods of ‘Extreme Fear’ can amplify price swings and create significant uncertainty. While some investors might see this as a time to retreat, others view it as an opportunity. Here’s how to navigate these turbulent times: Understand Your Risk Tolerance: Are you a risk-averse investor or someone who can stomach significant price fluctuations? Your risk tolerance should guide your decisions during periods of fear. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Don’t make impulsive decisions based solely on market fear. Conduct thorough research on the projects you’re invested in or considering investing in. Understand their fundamentals and long-term potential. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market bottom, consider DCA. This involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the price. DCA can help mitigate the risk of buying high and can be particularly effective during volatile periods. Stay Informed but Avoid Overconsumption of News: Keep abreast of market developments and news that can impact crypto prices. However, avoid constantly checking prices and news feeds, as this can exacerbate anxiety and lead to emotional trading decisions. Zoom Out and Take a Long-Term Perspective: Cryptocurrency is a relatively new asset class, and volatility is part of its journey. Try to take a long-term perspective and remember why you invested in crypto in the first place. Focus on the long-term potential rather than short-term price fluctuations. Bitcoin Dominance: A Sign of Market Uncertainty? Bitcoin dominance is another interesting metric to watch during periods of ‘Extreme Fear.’ Historically, when fear grips the market, investors tend to flock to Bitcoin as a perceived ‘safer’ crypto asset compared to altcoins. This can lead to an increase in Bitcoin dominance as altcoins often suffer more significant price drops during downturns. While Bitcoin dominance can provide insights into market risk appetite, it’s not a foolproof indicator. It’s essential to consider it alongside other factors and not rely solely on Bitcoin dominance to make investment decisions. However, a rising Bitcoin dominance during ‘Extreme Fear’ periods can reinforce the narrative of risk aversion in the market. Actionable Insights from the Fear & Greed Index The Crypto Fear and Greed Index , while indicating ‘Extreme Fear,’ isn’t necessarily a doomsday signal. Here are some actionable insights you can derive: Potential Buying Opportunity: Historically, ‘Extreme Fear’ zones have sometimes presented buying opportunities for long-term investors. When fear is high, asset prices can be suppressed, potentially offering entry points at lower valuations. Market Correction Confirmation: The index confirms the ongoing market correction and highlights the depth of negative sentiment. This awareness can help manage expectations and avoid panic selling. Risk Management Reminder: ‘Extreme Fear’ serves as a crucial reminder to review your risk management strategies. Ensure your portfolio allocation aligns with your risk tolerance, especially during periods of heightened volatility. Contrarian Investing Signal: Some investors use the Fear & Greed Index as a contrarian indicator. When fear is extreme, they see it as a signal that the market might be oversold and due for a potential rebound. Important Note: The Fear & Greed Index is a sentiment indicator, not a precise predictor of price movements. It should be used as one tool among many in your crypto analysis toolkit and not as the sole basis for investment decisions. Conclusion: Navigating Fear, Staying Informed The Crypto Fear and Greed Index falling further into ‘Extreme Fear’ underscores the current unease in the cryptocurrency market. While this sentiment can be unsettling, it’s crucial to remember that market cycles are a natural part of crypto’s evolution. By understanding what drives this fear, employing sound risk management strategies, and staying informed, you can navigate these periods effectively. The index provides valuable insights into market indicators , but ultimately, informed decisions based on thorough research and a long-term perspective are key to success in the dynamic world of crypto. Don’t let fear dictate your actions; instead, use it as a signal to be cautious, diligent, and strategic.

This is why smart money is rushing in: Guaranteed 140% ROI at Launch – MUTM will launch at $0.06, meaning every $1,000 invested today will become $2,400. After going live, Analysts are predicting a rise to $1.50, which would be a staggering 5,900% return for Phase 4 investors. These factors together enable the platform’s buy-and-distribute mechanism that uses fees to buy back MUTM and creates constant upward pressure. Meme coins have zero utility, while Mutuum Finance does. Its lending protocol allows users to borrow against crypto assets, while they earn passive income in the form of mtTokens. And it’s not speculation — it’s DeFi with real yield. The Last Low-Price Window: Phase 4 The clock is ticking. MUTM price surges to $0.03 (20% increase) at the start of Phase 5. This also means that today’s $0.025 entry would be short-lived. Here’s the math: Price (step 4): $0.025 Next Phase (Phase 5): $0.03 (20% increase) Launch Price: $0.06 (140% gain) Target after launch: $1.50 (5,900% potential) It’s the first time we even see this and early investors in the past phases are already locking massive gains. And, with Phase 4 available now, this the last chance to buy before the next price increase. Sustainability and Growth Mutuum Finance does not have any corners being cut. The team is currently completing a Certik audit, the gold standard in smart contract security. The results, once finalized, will be made public, providing yet another level of trust. Additionally, there is an overcollateralized stablecoin in the works, further ensuring the stability of the ecosystem. Add peer-to-peer lending functionality to that mix and MUTM is a DeFi staple, not just a flash-in-the-pan token. The Bottom Line The glory days of Dogecoin are over, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has only just begun. MUTM is differentiated from speculative assets with a real-use lending platform, explosive presale demand, and a tokenomics model crafted to create sustainable value. Phase 4 won’t last—secure your tokens at $0.025 before the next price surge.

Negative aspects: It has low AUM, is illiquid, and has a high bid-ask spread. Still better than its competitor YBIT, which in my opinion is a high-dividend trap (above 90%). In my opinion, it’s important to monitor how the fund is managed and maintain an active allocation to limit the risk of capital losses. It’s still a very young ETF for an objective evaluation, but for now, I don’t see any major concerns, except for its liquidity. It's a time of pullbacks across markets, and even the crypto market, led by Bitcoin, is feeling the effects of the red season. And it's precisely during steep downturns like this that covered call ETFs come back to mind. In my view, these are instruments that should be avoided during a bull market, especially under a buy & hold strategy , but they might become worth considering after strong sell-offs, though only for investors looking for cash flows. [[BTCI]] falls into this category, and for that reason, I believe it deserves a closer look, even if, in my opinion, it's still a bit too premature to be seriously considered as a long-term portfolio holding. What is BTCI? NEOS is well-known for this type of ETF , and BTCI, while not the only “exotic” product in its catalog, is definitely the one that’s caught my eye the most. As always, here’s a quick list of what I believe are the key facts to know when considering BTCI: Covered call strategy using European-style options on CBTX, meaning they can only be exercised at expiration. This offers potential tax benefits (Section 1256), with a return of capital (ROC) ranging from 95–100%. It’s expensive, with a 0.98% expense ratio. Pays monthly distributions, with a TTM dividend yield of 17% according to Seeking Alpha, and a 30-day distribution rate of 3.11% (as per NEOS). It’s illiquid, with AUM around $127M and a very low average trading volume (~200 shares) and a bid-ask spread of 0.38%. And while NEOS isn’t the largest issuer in the buy-write ETF space, it essentially has a small monopoly here with BTCI. Its direct competitor YBIT seems (to me) far less efficient: it doesn’t solve the liquidity problem, and its distribution structure feels overly misleading. [[YBIT]] flaunts a 99% dividend yield, which might sound “unmissable”, but due to heavy capital losses, the total return is underwhelming, making it hard to justify its expense ratio (4x BTCI). Profile (BTCI - YBIT) (Seeking Alpha) BTCI, the comparison of strategy BTCI holds up to 25% in HODL ETF shares through offshore subsidiaries , while the remaining 75% is allocated to T-bills, which act as collateral for a synthetic covered call strategy. The strategy is flexible, as clearly stated in the prospectus, and given the high turnover along with an average distribution rate of 25–30%, it seems management is targeting a 2–3% monthly payout. On the other hand, YBIT is almost entirely synthetic, with 100% exposure to T-bills used as collateral for managing synthetic options exposure (0–50%). This allows it to generate higher monthly income, but mathematically translates into lower capital returns. Not only that, the synthetic construction causes wider NAV dislocations, which has already happened: up to 8% deviation in certain scenarios. BTCI, instead, has shown tighter NAV tracking, with deviations usually between 1–2%. Does it make sense to hold it? My opinion One of the most common criticisms of Bitcoin is that it doesn’t generate cash flows. While I don’t believe this is a real flaw of Bitcoin, it’s interesting how BTCI directly addresses this issue. By holding HODL ETF (forgive the pun) and applying a managed options strategy, BTCI becomes a product that fills this gap. So in theory, it can play a role in a portfolio for those seeking cash flows, although only with a small allocation, and definitely NOT as a substitute for Bitcoin. That’s because we must not forget these are two different instruments, and they behave differently: for example, during the bull market, BTCI underperformed BTC (naturally, due to the nature of the options strategy), but interestingly, during recent market declines, BTCI has outperformed BTC in terms of total return, despite both posting losses. BTCI - BTC (Seeking Alpha) Risk Overall, if we expect steady growth in BTC over the years, the capital gains of BTCI will be lower than the underlying asset, because the objective is cash flow, not total return. This is not a problem, in fact, it’s the very reason why BTCI exists. What matters is that the fund maintains a solid relationship with NAV and does not generate progressive capital losses. I say this from experience: in some cases, if the fund is poorly managed, it could end up destroying value, especially if it pushes too hard in its search for yield. This tends to happen when, in an attempt to attract more (less informed) investors, management (which becomes more of a marketing arm) increases the synthetic exposure. In short: it boosts the “dividend” yield, but this can compromise the ETF’s link to the underlying. That’s why covered call ETFs, especially actively managed and illiquid ones like BTCI, in my opinion, must be monitored as closely as they are managed. To reduce risk, I personally think it’s better to decrease allocations as the bull market progresses, to avoid being trapped in a bear market (when fund outflows could push management to increase the yield even more). Conversely, I believe bear markets should be taken as opportunities, a chance to lower the average cost basis and reduce the risk of getting trapped in the fund should it lose its NAV tracking (assuming, of course, you believe the underlying asset will continue to grow). BTCI (Seeking Alpha) Conclusion It’s difficult to assign an objective rating to a fund with such a short track record, especially in this category, where time-tested performance is essential for proper evaluation. However, based on its current structure, I don’t see major concerns beyond this. For investors seeking cash flow, it could gradually prove to be a viable option. That said, like most covered call ETFs, I don’t believe a buy & hold strategy is the right approach here. All things considered, at this stage, a fair rating for this ETF would be: HOLD.",BTC-USD|BTC|YBIT|BTCI,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-04-09 09:34:23

Bitcoin Sliding Towards $70K as Trump Tariffs Shake Global Markets; Ethereum Drops 10% Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader crypto market fell sharply on Wednesday as sweeping global tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump rattled investors worldwide and triggered steep losses in risk assets. Bitcoin briefly dropped to just below $76,000 in early trading before staging a modest recovery, but analysts warn that a drop to the $70,000-$75,000 range is a real possibility if trade tensions escalate. “While the short-term outlook for investors calls for caution, Bitcoin could fall to the $70,000-$75,000 range if trade tensions escalate,” said Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research. Ether (ETH) led the losses among major cryptocurrencies, shedding 10% on the day. Other top tokens including XRP, Dogecoin (DOGE), Binance’s BNB, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA) are down more than 5%. Total crypto market cap is down 6%, bringing its one-week decline to nearly 15%. Smaller tokens and memecoins suffered even deeper losses. Berachain’s BERA token dropped 20%, while popular meme assets like Bonk (BONK), Pepe (PEPE), and Floki (FLOKI) lost more than 9%. The sell-off reversed gains from Tuesday's relief rally as investors pulled capital from risk assets amid rising trade fears. Trump's new tariffs, which take effect today, include a 104% hike in the price of Chinese goods and new import duties affecting more than 60 US trading partners, sparking fears of a prolonged global trade war. *This is not investment advice.

The altcoins have also turned red, with substantial losses from the likes of ETH, DOGE, UNI, NEAR, and others. BTC Fails at $80K It’s safe to say that the aggressive US macro policy continues to impact the cryptocurrency market. Just last week on Wednesday, the largest of the bunch shot up to over $88,000 amid reports that Trump will dump Musk from his inner circle. However, BTC slumped hard hours later after the POTUS announced that essentially every country will face at least a 10% tax , and many, such as China and those in the EU, will have bigger percentages. The cryptocurrency dumped toward $81,000 but managed to defend that level. More volatility ensued by the end of the weekend and on Sunday evening when the asset lost the $80,000 support. On Monday, it nosedived to a five-month low of around $74,000. It bounced off rather quickly and spiked toward $80,000 and $81,000 on a couple of occasions but was ultimately stopped after Trump intensified the tariffs against China, which are now set at 104%. BTC dropped toward $75,000 but defended that level and now sits around $77,000. Its market cap has declined to $1.530 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts is still above 60%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Alts Return to Red Yesterday’s relief rallies didn’t last long as most altcoins have turned red once again. Ethereum continues to be among the poorest performers, having dumped by another 5% today. Moreover, it dumped to a multi-year low earlier today, which essentially erased the gains from the last seven years. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

Even XRP, which saw some big news yesterday, has lost some ground, while UNI and NEAR have plunged the most.

The recent heavy dump by the large investors or whales has also weighed on the DOGE price, as evidenced by the recent plunge of around 4%. Besides, it also reflects the waning risk-bet appetite of the investors, which might further drag the meme coin’s price lower in the coming days. Dogecoin Whales Offload 1 Bln Tokens A massive sell-off by Dogecoin whales has sent shockwaves through the crypto market, sparking concerns about the future trajectory of DOGE price. According to data from Santiment, a prominent market analytics platform, large investors have dumped 1.32 billion Dogecoin in the last 48 hours. Source: Ali Martinez, X Market analyst Ali Martinez highlighted this alarming trend, citing Santiment data, and warned that waning risk appetite among investors could further drag prices lower in the coming days. The sell-off by the Dogecoin whales is seen as a reflection of the broader market’s volatile scenario, with investors seemingly losing confidence in the cryptocurrency’s growth prospects. This significant dump has weighed heavily on the price of DOGE, which plummeted by approximately 4% in recent trading sessions. However, a recent DOGE price prediction showed that the crypto is currently at a neutral position and might hover around its current level through this month. Meanwhile, Ali Martinez has also identified a crucial support level for the DOGE price that investors should keep a close eye on. According to Martinez, the leading meme coin has consistently respected a rising trendline since October 2023, which now converges with the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement at $0.13. This convergence of technical indicators makes $0.13 a key price level to watch, as it could potentially determine the short-term trajectory of DOGE. Source: Ali Martinez, X Martinez’s observation highlights the significance of this support level, which could act as a strong support for future price movements. A breach of this level could signal a further decline while maintaining above it could trigger renewed confidence in the traders. DOGE Price Slips: More Dip Incoming? Dogecoin price today was down more than 4% and exchanged hands at $0.1467 amid the Dogecoin whales dump. Its one-day volume fell 26% to $1.99 billion. Notably, the crypto has briefly maintained the $0.13 support over the last 24 hours, while touching a low of $0.1367 and a high of $0.1567. Besides, the derivatives data by CoinGlass showed that Dogecoin Futures Open Interest also fell 1.12%, reflecting the gloomy sentiment hovering in the market.

A week ago, Trump announced sweeping tariffs against many nations, including a hefty levy on Chinese imports that's now been lifted to 104%. Financial markets cratered on concerns the move will drag the U.S. and other economies into recession. The Nasdaq 100 has lost 12% and bitcoin ( BTC ), the largest cryptocurrency by market value, dropped 10%, hitting prices below $75,000 at one point. Volatility in the U.S. Treasury market exploded, with yields on longer-dated bonds surging, sending prices lower even as equity markets swooned. That has raised fears of a full-blown dollar liquidity crisis like the one observed five years ago during the COVID crash. Speculation is rife the Federal Reserve will soon take action to ease liquidity conditions, as it did in 2020, putting a floor under asset prices. Traders have priced in at least five quarter-point interest-rate cuts from Fed Chair Jerome Powell for this year, according to the CME's FedWatch tool. Roubini suggests that won't happen. ""There is, of course, a game of chicken between the Trump put and the Powell put. But I would say that the strike price for the Powell put is going to be lower than the strike price for the Trump put, meaning Powell is going to wait until it’s Trump who blinks,"" Roubini told Bloomberg . In other words, Powell will likely wait for Trump to temper his rhetoric before intervening to stabilize market volatility. This approach makes sense given the current market instability is largely a result of Trump's tariffs. The sentiment could quickly reverse with a single-social media post from Trump announcing a possible trade deal or negotiation with China. An episode from early this week is symptomatic. On Monday, an unconfirmed report of a tariff pause triggered a sharp surge in market valuations, only for the news to later be debunked as false. Sticky inflation, no recession Roubini, who runs Roubini Macro Associates, expects inflation to be sticky in a new world of higher tariffs, hurting longer-dated bonds. That partly explains the swoon in the 10- and 30-year U.S. Treasury notes and the resulting surge in yields. At the same time, he said he expects the U.S. to avoid slipping into a recession, contrary to the market zeitgeist and pricing in betting platforms, which suggests an over 50% chance of the economy facing back-to-back quarterly contractions in the growth rate.",Markets|US|Economy|Markets,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-09 09:40:40

Recent data reveals a surprising shift in the flow of funds within the U.S. Spot Ethereum ETF landscape. On April 8th, these investment vehicles, once hailed as a gateway to mainstream crypto adoption, experienced a combined net outflow of $3.29 million. Let’s dive into the details and understand what this could mean for the future of Ethereum and crypto investments. Why Did Spot Ethereum ETFs See Outflows? According to data shared by Trader T (@thepfund) on X, the total net outflow from U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs amounted to $3.29 million on April 8th. Interestingly, the outflow was solely attributed to Fidelity’s FETH. All other listed crypto ETFs reported no change in their holdings for the day. This raises a crucial question: Why was Fidelity’s FETH the only one experiencing these outflows? Here’s a breakdown of the key points: Total Net Outflow: $3.29 million across all U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs on April 8th. Sole Contributor: Fidelity’s FETH ETF accounted for the entire $3.29 million outflow. No Change for Others: All other Spot Ethereum ETFs showed no net change in holdings. This isolated outflow from FETH might suggest a variety of factors at play. It could be due to: Profit Taking: Investors who bought FETH earlier might be taking profits after recent price movements in Ethereum. Portfolio Rebalancing: Institutional or large investors might be rebalancing their portfolios, shifting assets between different ETFs or asset classes. Specific Fund Dynamics: There might be fund-specific reasons related to FETH, such as investor sentiment or internal fund strategies. Market Volatility: General market uncertainty or volatility in the crypto space could trigger some investors to reduce their exposure, starting with specific funds. Understanding the Performance of Crypto ETFs While the $3.29 million outflow is noteworthy, it’s essential to put it into perspective. The broader crypto ETF market, particularly the newly launched Spot Bitcoin ETFs, has generally seen significant inflows since their inception. However, the situation with Ethereum ETFs is still evolving. Spot Ethereum ETFs are relatively new, and their performance and investor behavior can be influenced by several factors, including: Factor Description Market Sentiment towards Ethereum: Overall investor confidence in Ethereum’s price and future prospects plays a crucial role. Regulatory Landscape: Clarity and developments in crypto regulations can significantly impact investor appetite. Comparison with Bitcoin ETFs: The success and attention garnered by Spot Bitcoin ETFs can influence the flow into Ethereum ETFs. Ethereum Network Developments: Major upgrades, adoption rates, and technological advancements in the Ethereum ecosystem can drive investment. What Does This Mean for Ethereum ETF Investments? While a single day’s outflow of $3.29 million from Spot Ethereum ETFs might seem concerning, it’s crucial not to jump to conclusions. Market fluctuations and daily variations are common in the world of crypto investments. However, it does serve as a reminder of the inherent volatility and the importance of continuous monitoring. Actionable Insights for Investors: Don’t Panic: A single day’s outflow is not necessarily a trend. Observe for longer-term patterns. Diversification is Key: Consider diversifying your crypto portfolio rather than focusing solely on one asset or ETF. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, regulatory updates, and Ethereum network developments. Understand ETF Holdings: Be aware of the specific holdings and strategies of the ETFs you invest in. Long-Term Perspective: Crypto investments are generally considered long-term. Short-term fluctuations are part of the game. Navigating the Crypto ETF Landscape The world of crypto ETFs , especially Spot Ethereum ETFs , is still in its early stages. While they offer a regulated and accessible way to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies, they are not immune to market volatility and investor sentiment shifts. The recent outflow highlights the dynamic nature of this market and the need for investors to remain vigilant and informed. In conclusion, the $3.29 million net outflow from U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs on April 8th, primarily driven by Fidelity’s FETH, is a data point worth noting. While it doesn’t necessarily signal a major downturn, it underscores the importance of understanding the nuances of crypto ETF investments and staying informed about market dynamics. For investors, this event serves as a reminder to maintain a balanced perspective and focus on long-term strategies in the ever-evolving crypto landscape.

Last year, SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda publicly lambasted the agency for its handling of the industry under ex-Chair Gary Gensler, calling it a “disaster.” Thankfully, the winds of change have turned into a veritable typhoon and the old heavy-handed enforcement approach seems like a distant memory. Regime change at the White House, and consequent musical chairs at the SEC, has made the United States far more appealing to both established Web3 firms already headquartered there (Coinbase, Circle, Block, Ripple) and fast-rising projects seeking to make their mark. Against the backdrop of a brightening regulatory landscape, here are three projects worth keeping a close eye on in 2025. Space and Time (SxT) LA-based decentralized data warehouse Space and Time is on a mission to power the future of DeFi and on-chain AI. Last year, the Microsoft-backed project unveiled the testnet of its own SXT Chain, conceived as the preeminent blockchain for ZK-proven data with the ability to index, sign, store, and reach consensus on data from major networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum. It’s safe to say Space and Time’s momentum hasn’t slowed down since. With the rise of the agentic economy, it has joined forces with Heurist, a decentralized AI-as-a-Service cloud, with the goal of creating a trustless “Web3 intelligence layer.” Its ecosystem has also expanded by over 100 projects, while its community has surpassed half a million members. One of SxT’s overarching ambitions is to give AI-generated smart contracts the ability to natively access verified data on-chain, which could be a game-changer for the AI-driven DeFi market (DeFAI). Io.net io.net , based in New York, is also concerned with AI, even if it doesn’t create or safeguard models itself. Dubbed the Internet of GPUs, it is a decentralized physical infrastructure network (dePIN) that delivers cost-effective compute power, at scale, to machine learning engineers around the world. Having raised $30 million in funding to date, the decentralized compute network has already established itself as one of the must-watch dePINs in Web3. Indeed, the market capitalization of its native token rose from $187.3 million in Q3 to $375.6m in Q4, driven by exploding demand for AI compute amid global chip shortages. Built atop Ray, an open-source framework for scaling AI and Python applications, io.net matches compute demand and supply based on factors such as geolocation and hardware specs, provisioning compute from underutilized sources like data centers and consumer GPUs. Ambient Sticking with the intersection of blockchain and AI, there is Ambient, a bold project with grand designs to facilitate super-intelligent yet cost-effective AI; a decentralized competitor to OpenAI, in other words. Having recently exited stealth mode, Ambient uses a Bitcoin-esque Proof-of-Work (PoW) system to achieve security while running more like Solana, and its vision has received the support of a16z, which backed the project to the tune of $7.2 million. One of the best reasons to keep an eye on Ambient is its team; Cofounder and CEO Travis, a Harvard graduate and ex-Head of Machine Learning for Union Pacific Railroad, was responsible for implementing the world’s only mathematically optimal freight railroading system. Cofounder and CTO Max, meanwhile, previously worked at Microsoft and Amazon. This year, Ambient intends to launch its testnet and incentivize Bitcoin miners to jump ship. Well, there you have it: three innovative US blockchain projects making the most of a crypto-friendly domestic policy landscape. While predicting the fortunes of the wider market is a fool’s errand, we’re pretty sure these ventures will be worth watching in the year ahead.",Information|Blockchain,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-09 09:41:12

Taiko, the innovative Ethereum-equivalent rollup, has just announced a game-changing move that’s set to broaden the horizons of cryptocurrency accessibility. Imagine a world where accessing new crypto tokens is as simple as checking your banking app. Well, that future is rapidly becoming our present, thanks to Taiko’s latest integration. Taiko Token Makes Waves with Revolut Crypto Listing In a groundbreaking announcement that has sent ripples of excitement across the crypto community, Taiko revealed on X (formerly Twitter) that its native Taiko token is now available on Revolut. This isn’t just another listing; it’s a strategic alliance that leverages Revolut’s massive user base. According to a press release distributed via PR Newswire, this collaboration is poised to significantly expand Taiko’s reach, tapping into Revolut’s impressive network of over 45 million users spanning across 50 countries. This move is a powerful testament to the growing convergence of traditional finance and the burgeoning world of decentralized digital assets. But what exactly does this mean for you, the crypto enthusiast, and the broader financial landscape? Let’s delve deeper into the implications of this exciting development. Why is this Revolut Crypto Listing a Big Deal for Taiko Token? For Taiko, securing a listing on a platform like Revolut is akin to hitting a crypto jackpot. Here’s why: Massive Exposure: Revolut’s 45 million users represent a colossal pool of potential Taiko token holders. This listing instantly puts Taiko in front of millions who may be curious about or already engaged with cryptocurrencies. Simplified Access: Revolut is known for its user-friendly interface, making it incredibly easy for individuals to buy, sell, and manage various financial assets, including now, Taiko token . This ease of access lowers the barrier to entry for new crypto investors. Global Reach: With operations in 50 countries, Revolut provides Taiko with an unprecedented global stage. This international exposure is crucial for the widespread adoption of any cryptocurrency. Credibility Boost: Being listed on a reputable financial application like Revolut lends significant credibility to Taiko. It signals to the market that Taiko is a legitimate and promising project. Understanding Taiko: An Ethereum Rollup Explained To truly appreciate the significance of this listing, it’s essential to understand what Taiko is and why it matters in the Ethereum ecosystem. Taiko is described as an Ethereum rollup , but what does that actually mean? In simple terms, an Ethereum rollup is a Layer-2 scaling solution designed to enhance the speed and reduce the costs associated with transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. Think of Ethereum as a bustling main highway (Layer-1) and rollups as efficient express lanes (Layer-2) built alongside it. Here’s a breakdown of key aspects of Ethereum rollups like Taiko: Feature Description Scalability Solution Rollups process transactions off the main Ethereum chain, bundling them together (“rolling them up”) and then submitting them to Ethereum as a single transaction. This significantly increases transaction throughput and reduces gas fees. Ethereum Equivalence Taiko is specifically designed to be Ethereum-equivalent. This means it aims to replicate the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) environment, making it easier for developers to port their existing Ethereum-based applications to Taiko with minimal modifications. Security Rollups inherit the security of the Ethereum mainnet. They post transaction data back to Ethereum, ensuring that transactions are verifiable and secure. Types of Rollups There are two main types: Optimistic Rollups and Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Rollups. While the article doesn’t specify Taiko’s rollup type, both aim to achieve similar scaling benefits but through different mechanisms. By leveraging Ethereum rollup technology, Taiko aims to create a more scalable and efficient environment for decentralized applications (dApps) and users within the Ethereum ecosystem. This makes transactions faster and cheaper, paving the way for wider adoption of blockchain technology. Revolut: Bridging Traditional Finance and Cryptocurrency Adoption Revolut isn’t just a financial app; it’s a fintech powerhouse that has been steadily embracing the crypto revolution.

43117243,https://crypto.news/?p=14353093,1744192345,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/43117243.jpeg,Who controls your digital identity? Blockchain’s answer to AI avatar risks | Opinion,https://crypto.news/blockchain-has-the-answer-to-ai-avatar-risks-opinion/,"Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news’ editorial. AI-generated avatars and virtual assistants will revolutionize our digital landscape, powering virtual influencers, workplace stand-ins, and immersive metaverse experiences. Yet, beneath this technological marvel lies a pressing question: who truly owns and controls your digital identity? The reality is stark—most AI avatars are tethered to centralized platforms where corporations hold dominion, exposing users to exploitation, financial fraud, and a profound loss of autonomy. As these digital personas become integral to our virtual lives, the need for a transformative solution has never been more urgent. You might also like: AI’s trust problem can be solved using ZK solutions | Opinion Decentralizing AI avatars through blockchain technology and smart contracts emerges as a vital antidote, promising to restore control to individuals in an increasingly virtualized world. The dangers of centralized systems are vividly demonstrated by high-profile abuses that have shaken public trust. In January 2024, a deepfake robocall mimicking U.S. President Joe Biden targeted New Hampshire voters, falsely urging Democrats to skip the primary in a bid to sway the 2024 election. This brazen act of manipulation, which prompted an FCC ruling to ban deepfake robocalls and ignited debates over AI regulation, exposed the fragility of centralized platforms that harbor the data fueling such scams. The entertainment industry offers another stark warning. In early 2024, explicit deepfake images of Taylor Swift flooded social media, amassing over 45 million views before removal after a 17-hour delay. This incident laid bare the limitations of centralized content moderation, which often falters under pressure, leaving women and public figures disproportionately vulnerable to digital harm. The fallout was swift—Swift’s team condemned the breach, and platforms scrambled to respond, yet the delay highlighted a systemic failure to protect digital likenesses in real-time. Additionally, Meta’s Oversight Board recently took up cases involving deepfake explicit imageries, noting inconsistent moderation practices— certain content was removed faster than others due to not passing specific community guidelines, highlighting inequities in centralized systems. These examples show how centralized avatar management leaves users powerless and unable to prevent misuse of their digital likeness. Why AI avatars need to be decentralized Centralized platforms trap users in ecosystems where their digital identities are subject to exploitation or sudden deactivation at corporate whim. This unchecked dominance shatters the vision of a user-empowered digital future, reducing individuals to mere cogs in a profit-driven machine. Decentralization flips this narrative, fostering self-sovereign identity where users hold the reins, owning and managing their avatars with confidence. By placing control in the hands of individuals, decentralized systems can curb corporate overreach, ensuring AI avatars reflect their creators’ intent rather than serve as tools for exploitation. Blockchain-powered AI ownership Blockchain technology stands as a beacon of hope against these escalating threats. Through on-chain verification, it forges an unalterable record of avatar ownership, forging a secure bond between digital identities and their rightful owners while decisively countering unauthorized deepfake abuse. This was painfully evident in February 2023, when a French interior designer fell pray in a romance scam : fraudsters wielded AI-generated images and messages to impersonate Brad Pitt, spinning a tale of a fabricated relationship and a fabricated cancer diagnosis that convinced her to part with €830,000—her life savings—before the deception unraveled. Such episodes unveil the dangers of centralized platforms, which hoard user data and become fertile ground for AI-driven fraud, eroding trust and inflicting devastating personal losses. Without a verifiable system to authenticate digital identities, AI-driven deception will only intensify. Users are left defenseless as deepfakes become more sophisticated and harder to detect. The challenge is clear: How can we secure digital avatars against misuse while ensuring individuals, not corporations, maintain control over their online presence? Yet, blockchain’s potential extends further. Smart contracts bolster this framework by automating rights management, guaranteeing avatars operate with unwavering security and transparency while fortifying defenses against fraud. This comprehensive approach not only shields digital assets from theft but also alleviates the ethical and legal burdens intensified by centralized oversight, equipping users with verifiable dominion over their virtual selves. A web3 future for AI avatars Decentralized AI avatars can also drive a vibrant web3 economy, integrating into metaverses, digital workspaces, and decentralized social networks. These avatars can become dynamic assets—representing users in virtual worlds, facilitating remote collaboration, or enabling secure interactions online. Picture a musician selling a unique avatar on a decentralized marketplace or a professional using a blockchain-verified digital twin to authenticate their presence in a virtual meeting. This ecosystem thrives on user ownership, positioning decentralized AI avatars as a foundation for the next digital economy. The drive to decentralize AI avatars is non-negotiable—centralized systems, exposed by explosive deepfake scandals and crumbling moderation, threaten to dismantle safety and freedom in an AI-drenched world. Blockchain carves a decisive path to empowerment, handing the reins of digital identity back to individuals, not corporate overlords. The clock is ticking: seize control of your digital destiny now, or watch it vanish into a dystopian abyss of corporate domination.

Whispers from Reuters suggest China’s top brass is huddling today, April 9th, to strategize their counter-moves against the ever-present threat of US tariffs . This isn’t just about trade deals anymore; it’s about global economic ripples that could significantly impact the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. Let’s dive deep into what this urgent meeting could mean for your crypto portfolio and the broader financial landscape. Why are China Tariffs Back in the Spotlight? Trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies are hardly new, but they are a persistent undercurrent shaping global markets. The potential for renewed or escalated US tariffs on Chinese goods throws a fresh curveball into the mix. Why is this happening now, and why should crypto enthusiasts pay attention? Economic Pressures: Both the US and China are navigating complex economic landscapes. Tariffs can be used as tools to protect domestic industries, influence trade balances, or exert political pressure. Geopolitical Dynamics: Beyond economics, geopolitical considerations play a huge role. Trade policies are often intertwined with broader strategic rivalries and international relations. Market Sensitivity: Financial markets, including the crypto market , are highly sensitive to geopolitical and economic uncertainties. News of potential tariff escalations can trigger volatility and shifts in investor sentiment. Decoding the Reuters Report: What We Know So Far The Reuters report, citing sources familiar with the matter, indicates that top Chinese leaders are meeting to discuss responses to US tariff policies . While official confirmation is pending, the news itself is enough to stir speculation and anticipation. Here’s a breakdown of what we can glean: Source Information Confirmation Reuters Meeting of China’s top leaders to discuss US tariffs Citing two sources familiar with the matter Chinese Authorities Request for comment No immediate response The lack of immediate official comment from Chinese authorities adds an element of suspense and underscores the sensitivity of the discussions. Markets are left to interpret the silence, often leading to increased volatility, particularly in sectors perceived as vulnerable to trade tensions . How Could US Tariffs Impact the Global Economy ? Tariffs are not isolated events; they create a domino effect across the global economy . Understanding these potential repercussions is crucial to navigating the uncertain waters ahead: Supply Chain Disruptions: Tariffs can disrupt established global supply chains, making goods more expensive and potentially leading to shortages. This can impact various industries, from manufacturing to technology. Inflationary Pressures: Increased costs due to tariffs can be passed on to consumers, contributing to inflationary pressures. This erodes purchasing power and can slow down economic growth. Reduced Trade Flows: Tariffs are designed to make imported goods less competitive, potentially leading to a decrease in international trade. This can harm export-oriented economies and reduce overall global economic activity. Retaliatory Measures: Tariffs often trigger retaliatory tariffs from affected countries, escalating trade tensions into full-blown trade wars. This tit-for-tat cycle can be highly damaging to the global economy . The Crypto Market Connection: Why Should Crypto Investors Care? You might be wondering, what does all this trade talk have to do with cryptocurrencies? The answer is: quite a lot. The crypto market , while often perceived as independent, is deeply intertwined with the broader financial ecosystem and the global economy . Here’s why: Risk-On/Risk-Off Sentiment: When trade tensions escalate and economic uncertainty rises, investors tend to become risk-averse. This can lead to a ‘risk-off’ sentiment, where investors move away from perceived riskier assets like cryptocurrencies and towards safer havens. Inflation Hedge Narrative: Conversely, in an inflationary environment potentially exacerbated by tariffs, some investors may turn to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. This narrative can drive demand and potentially support prices. Global Liquidity Flows: Trade tensions and economic policy shifts can influence global liquidity flows. Changes in currency valuations and capital controls in response to trade disputes can impact the movement of funds into and out of the crypto market . Market Volatility: News headlines about tariffs and trade talks inject volatility into all financial markets, including crypto. Traders react to the uncertainty, leading to price swings and potentially creating both opportunities and risks. Navigating Crypto Investments Amid Trade Tensions : Actionable Insights So, what can crypto investors do to navigate this period of potential trade tensions and market uncertainty? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on news developments related to US tariffs and China’s responses. Reliable news sources like Reuters and financial news outlets are crucial. Diversify Your Portfolio: Diversification is key in volatile times. Don’t put all your eggs in one crypto basket. Consider a mix of different cryptocurrencies and potentially traditional assets to mitigate risk. Manage Risk: Be prepared for potential market volatility. Use risk management tools like stop-loss orders and consider reducing your exposure to highly volatile assets if you are risk-averse. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that the crypto market is inherently volatile, and short-term fluctuations are common. Maintain a long-term perspective and avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term news cycles. Fundamental Analysis: Focus on the fundamentals of the cryptocurrencies you invest in. Strong projects with solid technology and use cases are more likely to weather market storms. Conclusion: Bracing for Potential Market Shifts China’s urgent meeting to discuss responses to US tariffs is a stark reminder of the interconnectedness of the global economy and the crypto market . While the exact outcomes and impacts remain uncertain, being informed, prepared, and strategic is paramount. The coming days and weeks could bring significant market shifts, and understanding the potential implications of trade tensions is crucial for every crypto investor. Stay vigilant, stay informed, and navigate these potentially turbulent times with a well-thought-out strategy.

However, some analysts consider a 15% bounce toward a key historical support is necessary to target higher levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin Headed To $69,000? Analyst Says BTC’s Short-Term Future Hangs On These Levels Is Solana Bull Run Over? Solana hit a 14-month low on Monday after falling 20% in 24 hours, momentarily trading around the $95 mark for the first time since February 2024. After the correction, SOL bounced around 18% to $112 before retracing toward the $100-$110 price range. Fueled by the market’s memecoin frenzy, the altcoin was one of the leading cryptocurrencies last year, hitting an all-time high (ATH) of $270 on January 19. Since then, the cryptocurrency has dropped over 63% from the start-of-year highs. During the Q1 retraces, Solana retested the $120 support zone several times, bouncing from the range, which served as a crucial level during the 2021 and 2024 rallies. However, several analysts pointed out that the support weakened with each retest, and losing that level could see Solana fall under the $100 mark and risk a 50% drop to the $60 support zone. After dropping below the key barrier, trader Crypto Bullet highlighted that SOL’s recent price action broke below August 5 lows, which signals that the cryptocurrency’s bull market could be over. According to the trader, Solana had a “clear 5-wave impulse to the upside that ended in January with TRUMP coin blow-off top,” which suggests a corrective a, b, c zigzag will follow. Based on this, the trader expects “a good mid-term bounce to ~$200 (Lower High)” for wave b and a drop to the $30-$40 price range for wave c. SOL Needs 15% Jump Analyst Ted Pillows considers that Solana could see a massive rally after the correction. He explained that SOL bounced from its multi-year ascending support trendline, a key rebound point in Q3 2023. The last time Solana retested this trendline, it rallied 1,000% toward the $270 mark. If the cryptocurrency holds this level, the analyst considers that SOL could bounce to its ATH in the coming months. Meanwhile, several analysts noted that recovering the $120 support zone is crucial after the recent price action, as this level could determine the altcoin’s next move again. Related Reading: XRP Breaks Out Of Head-And-Shoulders Pattern — Eyes Move Toward $1.30 Sjuul from AltCryptoGems highlighted that SOL needs to “give a clear bounce and reclaim the $120 level” now that “liquidity is taken.” He asserted that failing to recover this key range would suggest that another drop could be ahead. Similarly, Ali Martinez pointed out that Solana’s TD Sequential flashes a buy signal on the weekly chart. Per the post, SOL “needs to stay above $95 and break $121 to set the stage for a rally toward $147.” As of this writing, Solana trades at $105, a 1% decline in the daily timeframe.

The cryptocurrency market has not been spared in the ongoing bearish sentiment, despite not being directly included in the ongoing tariffs trade wars. Since Donald Trump took office earlier this year, the total cryptocurrency market cap has dropped by more than $1.5 trillion. With the VIX index suggesting more volatility ahead, the memecoin sector, led by Dogecoin (DOGE), will experience more volatility. Dogecoin Whales on the Move According to on-chain data, the overall supply of stablecoins into exchanges has increased in the past few days. The sharp spike in stablecoins supply on crypto exchanges could mean bullish traders are protesting their positions from forced liquidation, especially perpetual contract markets, or holders are demanding to sell their volatile crypto assets for stablecoins Meanwhile, Dogecoin investors with an account balance of at least 1 billion have sold over 1.32 billion coins in the past two days. DOGE Price Midterm Expectations After being rejected at the resistance level above $0.15 in the past two days, the DOGE price , against the US dollar, has experienced heightened bearish sentiment. The large-cap memecoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $21.75 billion at the time of this writing, gained around 4 percent during the Asian trading session to trade about $0.147 at the time of this writing. The slight bullish bounce is, however, floating in bear territory. From a technical analysis standpoint, DOGE’s price has been trapped in a falling trend in the past three months. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Crypto Market is Down?

The firm has received $12.5M in funding from Binance Labs, Animoca Brands, and other investors and is set to launch its native crypto coin FHE this year. Before that happens, let’s discuss the key details around the FHE airdrop and what to expect from the token price. Mind Network Airdrop Listing Details The Mind Network airdrop is among the most anticipated crypto airdrops of 2025 as investors await the FHE launch. The snapshots of the eligible candidates have already been taken, dated March 31, 2025, at 23:59 UTC, but the listing date and other details are currently pending. The official Mind Network announcement reveals that nearly 1% of the FHE supply will be distributed among the eligible candidates. More importantly, the minimum allocation stands at 10 FHE, which means every participant would receive some airdrop, growing anticipation around FHE token price. Mind Network Airdrop Eligibility Criteria Since the actual listing date of the Mind Network token is missing, investors are waiting for further updates on the situation. For now, the privacy-focused platform has revealed the eligibility, which includes five categories: CitizenZ Passport NFT holders Mainnet participants (e.g., vFHE delegators) Advocate Program referrers AgentConnect Hub users Community Contributors Steps to check eligibility: – Visit the official FHE airdrop page: https://agent.mindnetwork.xyz/airdrop Connect wallet (the wallet used for participation before snapshot) Agree to terms and conditions Click on eligibility Provide ownership with signing safe verification message Allocation will be visible on screen What Will be FHE Token Price at Launch? Along with much crucial information regarding the FHE airdrop, the token price at launch is also missing. Although the Mind Network team has not revealed the facts, investors anticipate a significant amount near $0.5 due to Bybit spot, Hashkey spot trading, and other top crypto exchange listing announcements. One crypto trader, Bolex predicted the FHE token price to come between $0.2 and $0.5, while others anticipated a higher amount. Investors must await further information on the Mind Network airdrop and TGE event for the right information.

Treasury yields are rising, Bitcoin has crashed by $500 billion, and the U.S.-China trade war is heating up. With $6.5 trillion in debt coming due, experts warn that this secret money injection may not be enough to prevent a financial crisis. US-China Trade War Sparks Uncertainty One of the biggest concerns right now is the growing tension between the U.S. and China. Last week, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian firmly opposed President Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs , stating that China would fight back. The increasing tariffs, which now reach up to 104% on certain Chinese goods, have led to economic strain between the two nations. Meanwhile, China’s slowing exports and capital outflow concerns are creating economic pressure. At the same time, the U.S. faces a $6.5 trillion debt crisis. Veteran analyst Peter Duan believes Trump’s tariffs aim to lower 10-year Treasury yields, but China’s move to sell U.S. Treasuries is pushing yields higher, worsening market instability. Trump forces tariff wars to lower the 10Y Treasury rate. Why? Because he needs to refinance the $6.5T of Treasuries coming due in a couple of months. China dumps US Treasuries to push yield up. Welcome to the world's biggest game of chicken. pic.twitter.com/YR5ttwvzk4 — Peter Duan (@BTCBullRider) April 8, 2025 Fed’s Silent Liquidity Boost While the Federal Reserve has not officially announced a policy change, but its actions tell a different story. The biggest sign is the sharp drop in the Fed’s Reverse Repo Facility (RRP), which fell from over $2.5 trillion in 2022 to just $148 billion, a staggering 94% decline. Experts say this quiet money injection acts like hidden quantitative easing (QE), adding cash to the system without announcing it. This has helped markets for now, but with RRP funds running low, worries are rising about what happens when this secret support runs out. Bitcoin Under Immense Pressure Bitcoin has been one of the biggest victims of this recent financial instability, losing over $500 billion since April 2. It briefly fell below $75,000 before a slight recovery, while altcoins such as ETH, XRP, Sol, ADA, and DOGE have struggled even more due to low liquidity. Historically, Bitcoin has thrived when money flowed into the market. Experts believe that if the Fed reintroduces QE in 2025, Bitcoin could surge again. In 2020, Fed liquidity pushed Bitcoin to record highs. Meanwhile, former Bitmex founder Arthur Hayes said that if history repeats, BTC might reach $250,000.",News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-09 10:05:21

The price reached the support; it bounced a few days before, which is also the 2018 high. This suggests the ETH price rally is currently trading at generational lows, and hence, the bottom of the prevailing bearish action could be nearby. The second-largest crypto, Ethereum, has been displaying massive strength for over a while that largely reflects its sustainability with an intent to maintain a healthy upswing. However, the token tests the 2018 highs for the first time since March 2023, suggesting the bottoms could probably be in. Additionally, the weekly ETH chart also hints towards a potential reversal, which may revive a decent ascending trend. The main thing to observe in the weekly chart of Ethereum is the RSI, which has reached the lower threshold after a long time. The weekly RSI has dropped below 30 just a couple of times before, during the bottoms of 2018 and 2022. Currently, the levels have reached a similar range, which suggests the ETH price bottom could be in. The second reason to be bullish on Ethereum is that the current price has dropped below the ETH realized price of $2000. Source: X The current price slipping below the realized price is a rare event that occurred only once before now. The last time this happened was in March 2020, when the ETH price dropped from $283 to $019. Now that the event has occurred again, history is also expected to repeat, which could trigger a huge ETH bull run towards a new ATH, probably above $6500 to $7000. In the short term, the Ethereum price slipping below $2000 hints towards a lot of eyes watching it. The decline in active addresses, lower fees burnt, and supply bump post-merge hint at a waning interest. Historically, these dips set the stage for major rebounds and with over 200% average run-up after past drops, this could be a huge buy zone. Therefore, the ETH price seems to be at the foothill of a massive explosion, which may elevate the levels close to a 5-digit figure soon.",Price Analysis|Ethereum,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-09 10:06:14

Assemblymember Clyde Vanel (D-33) filed Assembly Bill A7716 on Tuesday , aiming to initiate a formal study into how blockchain could be used to protect voter data and election results. The legislation directs the New York State Board of Elections to examine blockchain’s effectiveness in ensuring election integrity and deliver a report within one year. New York Bill Calls Blockchain an ‘Uncensored Truth’ for Election Security The bill defines blockchain as a decentralized, cryptographically secure, immutable, and auditable system capable of preserving an “uncensored truth.” It emphasizes collaboration between the Board of Elections and the Office of Information Technology Services, with input from experts in blockchain, cybersecurity, and election systems. Currently under review by the Assembly Election Law Committee, the bill has yet to face a full legislative vote. If it advances, it would need to pass both the Assembly and Senate before heading to the governor’s desk for final approval. Should it be enacted, the Board of Elections would be legally required to present its findings within 12 months, including examples of how other states and jurisdictions have implemented similar technologies. This is not Vanel’s first effort to introduce such a measure. Versions of the bill have circulated in the legislature since 2017, but none have progressed into law. However, growing national interest in blockchain’s public sector applications could give the proposal new momentum.

The legislation still ensures protections for digital payments, wallets, and node operations. At the federal level, attention on blockchain has intensified following former President Donald Trump’s executive order in March to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. 41 Bitcoin Reserve Bills Emerge Across 23 States The adoption of Bitcoin has also found momentum state-wide in the U.S. According to data from Bitcoin Law, 47 Bitcoin reserve bills have been introduced across 26 states, with 41 currently active. Just recently, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear officially signed House Bill 701 , known as the “Bitcoin Rights” bill, into law—making the state one of the latest to enact legislation protecting digital asset users and operations. Other states are making similar moves. Oklahoma’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act (HB 1203), introduced by Representative Cody Maynard, recently passed the House with a 77-15 vote and is awaiting a Senate decision. According to Bitcoin Laws, Oklahoma now ranks alongside Texas in second place in the race to establish state-level Bitcoin reserves. Missouri is also in the mix , with its Special Committee on Intergovernmental Affairs reviewing its own Bitcoin reserve proposal. Likewise, two key Bitcoin bills in Arizona cleared the House Rules Committee on March 24.

Assemblyman Clyde Vanel has introduced Assembly Bill 7716, a visionary proposal that seeks to harness the power of blockchain technology to revolutionize election security . This bill isn’t just about updating old systems; it’s about building a fortress of trust around our elections, ensuring that every vote counts and the democratic process remains unshakeable. Let’s dive deep into this exciting development and explore what it means for the future of voting. What is the New York Election Security Bill Proposing? Assembly Bill 7716, championed by Assemblyman Clyde Vanel, is laser-focused on enhancing the security and transparency of elections in New York. At its heart, the bill proposes the implementation of blockchain technology to protect two critical aspects of the electoral process: Safeguarding Voter Records: Imagine a digital ledger, immutable and transparent, recording every voter registration and ensuring no unauthorized alterations can occur. This is the promise of blockchain for voter records. It aims to eliminate the risks of data tampering and voter roll manipulation. Securing Election Results: From the moment ballots are cast to the final tally, blockchain can provide an auditable and tamper-proof trail. This means election results become incredibly difficult to alter, fostering greater public trust in the outcomes. Cointelegraph reported on X that this bill is gaining traction, highlighting the growing recognition of blockchain’s potential beyond cryptocurrencies and into critical societal infrastructure like elections. But what exactly are the benefits of using blockchain for election security ? The Compelling Benefits of Blockchain in Election Security Why blockchain? In a world increasingly concerned about digital security and the integrity of information, blockchain offers a suite of powerful advantages for securing elections: Enhanced Transparency: Every transaction on a blockchain is recorded and verifiable by participants. In the context of elections, this means an auditable trail of voter registrations and results, increasing transparency for all stakeholders. Immutable Records: Once data is recorded on a blockchain, it’s virtually impossible to alter or delete. This immutability is crucial for protecting sensitive voter data and election outcomes from tampering. Increased Security: Blockchain’s decentralized nature makes it highly resistant to cyberattacks. There’s no single point of failure, making it significantly more secure than traditional centralized databases. Improved Efficiency: While initial setup might require investment, in the long run, blockchain can streamline election processes, reduce administrative overhead, and potentially lower costs associated with manual audits and recounts. Boosted Public Trust: In an era of misinformation and distrust in institutions, blockchain’s transparent and secure nature can significantly enhance public confidence in the fairness and accuracy of elections. Consider this analogy: think of blockchain as a digital, publicly accessible ledger where every election-related transaction is written in ink that cannot be erased or altered. Everyone can view the ledger, ensuring accountability and trust in the system. Are There Challenges to Blockchain-Based Election Security? While the potential of blockchain technology for election security is immense, it’s crucial to acknowledge the challenges and considerations that need to be addressed for successful implementation: Scalability Concerns: Handling the massive volume of transactions during a large-scale election can be a challenge for some blockchain networks. Ensuring the system can scale to meet peak demand is critical. Complexity and Technical Expertise: Implementing and managing blockchain-based election systems requires specialized technical expertise. Training election officials and ensuring user-friendliness for voters is essential. Accessibility and Digital Divide: Ensuring equal access to blockchain-based voting systems for all citizens, including those with limited digital literacy or access to technology, is a significant hurdle. Measures to bridge the digital divide must be integrated into any blockchain election system. Regulatory Framework and Legal Clarity: Clear legal frameworks and regulations are needed to govern the use of blockchain in elections. This includes addressing issues like data privacy, voter authentication, and auditability. Cost of Implementation: The initial investment in developing and deploying blockchain-based election infrastructure can be substantial. Careful cost-benefit analysis and funding strategies are necessary. Despite these challenges, proponents argue that the long-term benefits of enhanced election security and increased voter trust outweigh the initial hurdles. Let’s look at some examples of where blockchain is already making inroads in voting. Examples of Blockchain in Elections: Glimpses into the Future While New York’s bill is a significant step, the idea of using blockchain for voting isn’t entirely new. Several initiatives around the world have explored or implemented blockchain-based voting systems, offering valuable insights and lessons: Voatz: This platform has been used in pilot elections in the US and internationally, focusing on mobile voting secured by blockchain. While it has faced scrutiny regarding security vulnerabilities, it represents an early attempt to leverage blockchain for voter convenience and accessibility. Follow My Vote: This project aims to build an open-source, end-to-end verifiable online voting platform using blockchain. Their focus is on transparency and voter verification throughout the voting process. Swiss Canton of Zug: Zug conducted a pilot project using blockchain for municipal voting, allowing residents to vote on certain issues via a mobile app secured by blockchain. This real-world example demonstrates the feasibility of blockchain voting in a government setting. West Virginia Pilot Program: In 2018, West Virginia allowed overseas military personnel to vote using a mobile app secured by blockchain. This initiative aimed to improve voting access for citizens stationed abroad. These examples, while varying in scale and success, highlight the growing interest and experimentation with blockchain technology to address the challenges of modern elections. New York’s proposed bill could become a pivotal case study in large-scale implementation. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for the Future of Voting? The New York election security bill is more than just a piece of legislation; it’s a signal of a potential paradigm shift in how we approach elections. Here are some key takeaways and actionable insights: Increased Focus on Digital Security: This bill underscores the urgent need to modernize election infrastructure and prioritize digital security in the face of evolving cyber threats. Growing Acceptance of Blockchain: Beyond cryptocurrencies, blockchain is increasingly being recognized for its potential to solve real-world problems, including enhancing the integrity of critical systems like elections. Potential for Wider Adoption: If New York’s initiative proves successful, it could pave the way for other states and even countries to explore and adopt blockchain-based election solutions. Call for Collaboration and Innovation: Implementing blockchain in elections requires collaboration between lawmakers, technologists, election officials, and cybersecurity experts. Innovation and open dialogue are crucial for success. Empowering Voters: Ultimately, the goal is to empower voters by ensuring their votes are secure, transparent, and accurately counted. Blockchain can be a powerful tool in achieving this objective. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards Secure and Transparent Elections New York’s proposed election security bill represents a revolutionary approach to safeguarding democracy in the digital age. By embracing blockchain technology , Assemblyman Vanel and New York are taking a bold step towards creating a more secure, transparent, and trustworthy election system. While challenges remain, the potential benefits of enhanced voter records security, tamper-proof results, and increased public trust are undeniable. This initiative could serve as a beacon, inspiring other jurisdictions to explore the transformative power of blockchain in securing the foundations of democratic governance. The journey to fully realizing blockchain’s potential in elections is just beginning, but New York’s bill marks an exciting and crucial milestone on that path.

The exchange announced on April 9 that it is delisting specific pairs for ACT, ALPHA, BLUR, CELR, PENGU, POND, and RUNE tokens as soon as this weekend. As a result, market onlookers are expecting additional heat on the assets’ prices amid an incessant broader market slump. Binance To Delist 7 Crypto Trading Pairs This Week: Why Are Investors Cautious? Binance’s recent announcement disclosed that the following spot trading pairs will be delisted on April 11 at 03:00 UTC: ACT/BRL, ALPHA/BTC BLUR/BTC CELR/BTC PENGU/BNB POND/BTC RUNE/BNB The decision to delist these spot trading pairs comes as the exchange looks to protect its users from emerging market risks while also maintaining a high-quality trading experience despite broader volatile trends. Notably, the delisting process also comes as these spot trading pairs exhibit poor liquidity and low trading volume, among other negative market reasons. However, “the delisting of a spot trading pair does not affect the availability of the tokens on Binance Spot,” the announcement added. Additionally, the leading crypto exchange will also terminate spot trading bot services for the abovementioned pairs on the same date and time. Users can still trade the spot trading pair’s base and quote assets on the platform. Overall, the delisting announcement ignited a bearish market wave, given that similar historical chronicles usually ushered in price volatility. CoinGape earlier reported that Binance announced plans to delist GALA, PERP, and two other crypto tokens, reverberating bearishness surrounding their prices. GALA’s price lost over 30% in value since the delisting announcement on March 26 to date. Similarly, PERP price cracked nearly 50% since the same. These waning price actions have in turn garnered bearish sentiments toward the abovementioned tokens. Further, the broader crypto market uncertainty due to macroeconomic trends has put additional pressure on crypto prices. As a result, market participants reflect a highly cautious approach when it comes to the seven tokens, whilst others may look to sell to avoid losses, bringing more heat to prices ahead.

The proposal, which includes plans to retire veCAKE, staking, gauges voting, and revenue sharing, has raised questions, particularly among protocols that have built entire ecosystems around these mechanics. In a fiery post on X , Cakepie DAO expressed deep frustration over the proposed retirement of veCAKE, a governance mechanism introduced to reward long-term commitment and align incentives across the ecosystem. We at Cakepie are deeply troubled by @PancakeSwap 's Tokenomics Proposal 3.0, specifically the proposed retirement of veCAKE. As the largest and most dedicated veCAKE holder, we were blindsided by this decision—learning about it at the same time as the rest of the community.… https://t.co/ExF3y7dj9K — Cakepie (@Cakepiexyz_io) April 9, 2025 What particularly rattled Cakepie was the manner in which the proposal was announced. Despite locking millions of CAKE tokens for four years in good faith and consistently contributing to liquidity growth, Cakepie claims it was blindsided, learning of the changes alongside the general public. Cakepie, which has locked in 13 million CAKE, emphasized that this abrupt change undermines not only its efforts but also the trust of the broader BNB Chain builder community. Tokenomics 3.0: A Vision for Deflation or a Retreat from Decentralization? PancakeSwap’s rationale for its Tokenomics 3.0 proposal centers around a vision of deflationary growth, revenue efficiency, and protocol simplicity. According to the team, the new model targets an ambitious 4% annual deflation rate and aims to cut daily CAKE emissions from 40,000 to 22,500. CAKE Tokenomics 3.0 Discussion Proposal Achieve ~4% annual deflation Retire CAKE Staking, veCAKE, Gauges Voting, and Revenue Sharing for true CAKE ownership Reducing CAKE emissions for a more efficient ecosystem Your feedback is important to us, and we are… pic.twitter.com/Wz64qrGbbx — PancakeSwap (@PancakeSwap) April 8, 2025 This marks a continuation of the exchange’s deflationary trend, following a 2.7% reduction in CAKE supply last year. In their forum post , PancakeSwap developers argued that veCAKE has failed to live up to expectations. They point to an overly complex governance system, inefficient capital allocation through bribed votes, and the misalignment between emissions and revenue generation. PancakeSwap also proposes unlocking all staked CAKE without penalties and redirecting all fees that were previously shared with stakers toward burning CAKE instead. They claim the goal is to simplify the user experience, reduce costs, and build a protocol that delivers real yield through increased trading volume and reduced token inflation. However, critics argue this comes at the cost of decentralization. veCAKE was designed to reward those who locked CAKE for long durations, granting them more influence in governance and directing emissions through gauges voting. Critics say that by removing veCAKE, PancakeSwap would shift influence away from long-term believers toward whales and short-term holders. Claims of Manipulation and a Call for Unity Adding fuel to the fire, Cakepie raised serious concerns about the governance process leading up to the proposal. The DAO claims that roughly 25 million CAKE tokens were locked across multiple wallets shortly before the Tokenomics 3.0 announcement, potentially orchestrating a governance attack. If true, this would allow participants to vote for the proposal and immediately unlock their tokens if the changes pass, undermining the spirit of fair participation. The DAO warned that a compromised governance process undermines trust and must not be overlooked. A similar DAO governance problem, although related to voting, caused a problem within the Aritrum ecosystem as some participants bought votes for a new committee election. @arbitrum DAO's governance faces scrutiny as vote-buying exposes vulnerabilities in decentralized systems, sparking debate on blockchain decision-making. #Crypto #ArbitrumDAO https://t.co/GlpycESe0I — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 8, 2025 For this PancakeSwap situation, instead of scrapping veCAKE entirely, Cakepie offers a number of constructive alternatives. Among them are direct rewards to pools that generate real value, allow veCAKE holders who vote to receive a portion of the trading fees, and let users exit early from veCAKE lockups in exchange for a penalty, preserving the incentive to commit while increasing flexibility.

However, one individual made the right bet, making $900k (accurately $840k) as the HYPE token price recovered from the crash. More significantly, the Hyperliquid exchange behind HYPE faced controversies over security, but things are settling. Let’s discuss. Crypto Trader Bets on Hyperliquid Price Surge, Making $900k According to the Lookonchain X post , an anonymous crypto trader positioned its trades on the perpetual future and used 3x leverage to make returns. Interestingly, they ended up with $840k in unrealized profits. The individual entered at $11.3667 while holding 858,832.29 HYPE despite the crypto market crash. Once the Hyperliquid price surged to $12.415 after its earlier crash amid whales’ liquidation events, the trader ended up with a $840k unrealized profit. Interestingly, the crypto investor has still not closed the trade and is awaiting further returns, as the HYPE price is moving up after centralized exchanges’ (CEX) attempts to ruin its image failed. If the price declines to $3.2477, the individual can face liquidation. For now, they are safe as the price is relatively high, currently at $12.47. Hyperliquid Survives the Alleged CEX Kill Attempts Hyperliquid is among the best crypto exchanges, especially in decentralized platforms. Its popularity fueled the HYPE token price, resulting in it hitting an ATH of $35.02 four months ago. However, this changed as whales deliberately removed collateral mid-trade, putting all the loss on the platform and crashing the token. With many more such events, a few crypto experts allegedly blamed the former Binance founder CZ and the centralized exchange (CEX) for trying to kill off this decentralized platform due to competition. Notably, this is just an unproven speculation, but the token’s price remained down, especially as Donald Trump’s tariff crashed the crypto market. As the market attempted recovery and the exchange implemented new risk policy , the HYPE token price surged 20% from the dip, benefitting the aforementioned crypto trader. It is attempting further recovery, but uncertainty remains amid Trump’s tariff implementation.

While uncertainty about the direction of BTC continues, CoinShares analyst argued that Bitcoin could quickly recover from the drop by following the trend of the US stock market. CoinShares analyst Christopher Bendiksen noted in a blog post that Bitcoin could experience a rapid recovery after a sharp drop, as it did during the COVID-19 market crash. The analyst noted that BTC’s current situation could repeat the 2020 pattern of sharp decline and recovery. The analyst noted that in 2020, BTC plummeted by more than 50% before experiencing a rapid recovery largely driven by stimulus measures. The analyst said that despite the current macroeconomic uncertainty and increased market volatility, a rapid recovery similar to 2020 could be experienced thanks to the possible policy easing of the Fed and pro-liquidity measures under the Donald Trump administration. Bendiksen also noted that the BTC price has a lag of about 90 days relative to global M2 money supply growth, which he warned could send BTC to $60,000 or lower, meaning there is still further downside risk before a possible recovery. “The current cryptocurrency market is very similar to that of 2020. And the conditions suggest that Bitcoin could follow the US stock market and then recover quickly. Since Bitcoin is a highly liquid asset, it tends to be more volatile in the early stages of a major market turbulence. But when things get going, they quickly stabilize. We have seen this phenomenon in the past during the COVID-19 crisis. Bitcoin fell by more than 50% in a short period of time, but quickly recovered within a few weeks. The subsequent bull market began as central banks around the world began printing money, pushing Bitcoin to new highs in 2021. Now, if Trump’s fiscal easing policies play out as planned, his policies could set the stage for a full-fledged bull market. Also, since the Fed’s return in 2022, Bitcoin has tended to follow the movement of global M2 (broad money supply) with a lag of about 90 days. If this pattern repeats, an explosive recovery is also in order. Given the low interest rates and quantitative easing environment that prevailed in 2020, a serious bull market could be in the works. On the other hand, if my prediction is wrong, we may have entered a reversal phase where the market is already trending downward. There could be a significant additional decline until demand and price come into balance, and the price of BTC could fall to $60,000 or even lower.” *This is not investment advice.

Jason Choi, the sharp mind behind prop investment firm Tangent, recently shared a candid account of his 2022 trading experience on X, offering a potent reminder: when it comes to Bitcoin analysis and investment, gut feelings and herd mentality can be treacherous paths. The $40,000 Bitcoin Bet and the Pricey Lesson in Crypto Market Timing Choi recounted his misstep of prematurely jumping back into Bitcoin (BTC) at $40,000 after a significant price dip. Influenced by what he termed ‘bottom calls’ from other fund managers, he acted on the contrarian principle of ‘buying the dip’. However, the market had other plans. Bitcoin continued its descent, eventually bottoming out at a much lower $15,000. Choi exited his position long before the true bottom, missing out on potential gains during the subsequent recovery. While 2022 was shaping up to be a profitable year, the dramatic FTX collapse delivered a painful blow, erasing 10% of his portfolio. This rollercoaster ride served as a harsh but invaluable lesson in crypto market timing . Why Blindly Following the Crowd (or Going Against It) Can Be a Recipe for Disaster in BTC Investment Choi’s experience underscores a critical point: the cryptocurrency market, especially Bitcoin, demands more than just impulsive actions. He highlighted how Bitcoin has matured and morphed from a relatively isolated ecosystem into a complex asset class deeply intertwined with global macroeconomic currents. The old strategies that might have worked in a nascent market are no longer foolproof in today’s intricate landscape. Referencing Warren Buffett’s famous mantra, “be greedy when others are fearful,” Choi astutely cautioned against the dangers of blindly applying this principle. Simply going against prevailing market sentiment without rigorous analysis can be a perilous strategy, particularly in the unpredictable crypto sphere. Bitcoin Analysis: Beyond the Hype – Understanding the Complexity So, what makes Bitcoin such a complex beast to tame? Here’s a breakdown: Macroeconomic Influences: Bitcoin no longer operates in a vacuum. It’s sensitive to global economic shifts, interest rate changes, inflation, and geopolitical events. These external factors can significantly impact its price trajectory. Regulatory Landscape: Government regulations and policy changes across different jurisdictions can create both headwinds and tailwinds for Bitcoin. Uncertainty in the regulatory environment adds another layer of complexity. Technological Evolution: The crypto space is constantly evolving. Technological advancements, blockchain updates, and the emergence of new protocols can influence Bitcoin’s dominance and value proposition. Market Maturity and Institutional Adoption: Increased institutional involvement brings both stability and new dynamics. Large players entering the market can amplify price swings and introduce sophisticated trading strategies. These factors, among others, contribute to Bitcoin’s intricate nature and necessitate a more nuanced approach to BTC investment . Crypto Trading Strategy: Actionable Insights from Choi’s Experience Choi’s trading journey, though marked by a setback, offers valuable takeaways for anyone navigating the crypto market: Due Diligence is Paramount: Don’t rely solely on ‘expert opinions’ or social media buzz. Conduct your own thorough research and bitcoin analysis before making investment decisions. Understand Market Cycles: Crypto markets are cyclical. Learning to identify and understand these cycles, rather than trying to predict short-term bottoms, can be more beneficial for long-term crypto trading strategy . Risk Management is Key: Always implement robust risk management strategies. Position sizing, stop-loss orders, and portfolio diversification are crucial tools to protect your capital. Macro Awareness: Stay informed about global macroeconomic trends and how they might impact the crypto market. Economic calendars and financial news should be part of your regular information diet. Continuous Learning: The crypto landscape is dynamic. Commit to continuous learning and adapt your strategies as the market evolves. Navigating the Bitcoin Maze: Informed Decisions are Your Best Compass Jason Choi’s experience serves as a potent reminder that in the world of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, informed decisions trump impulsive actions. While contrarian investing can be rewarding, it must be rooted in solid bitcoin analysis and a deep understanding of market dynamics, not just blind faith or fear of missing out. Bitcoin’s evolution into a complex asset demands a sophisticated approach, one that goes beyond simplistic strategies and embraces continuous learning and rigorous analysis.

It also added 12 U.S. companies to its export control list, banning exports of certain items. Six others, including Shield AI and Sierra Nevada Corporation, were labeled “unreliable” and banned from doing business or investing in China. China’s move further escalates the US-China tensions and the potential repercussions it could have on the global markets. U.S. stock index futures plunged sharply after the announcement. “The situation has dangerously escalated. As one of the affected members, China expresses grave concern and firm opposition to this reckless move, ” China said in a statement to the WTO, reported Reuters . China’s State Council Tariff Commission termed U.S’ move as “unilateralism” and “economic bullying.” China Slams US In WTO Meeting At a WTO trade meeting, China slammed the US for its reciprocal tariffs calling it a violation of global trade rules which undermine the multilateral trading system. It stressed that reciprocal tariff will never be a cure for trade imbalances and warned that it will backfire harming the US. Trump has hiked tariffs on Chinese imports by a massive 104% this year, intensifying a trade war that could seriously hurt China, the world’s top manufacturing exporter. However, China warned that it had the “determination and means” to continue the fight if Trump kept hitting with US tariffs. Besides, China’s Central Bank has asked state-owned banks to cut down US dollar purchases as it will not allow for sharp Yuan declines. Since Trump announced new tariffs last week, the S&P 500 has seen its worst drop since the 1950s and is now close to entering a bear market — down nearly 20% from its recent peak. Trump Not Too Worried Even safe-haven assets like U.S. Treasuries are being dumped, and the dollar is declining. Global markets suffer as the European markets are down, and US futures point toward more losses after a rough day in Asia. However, Trump doesn’t seem too worried as he says that the tariffs are “permanent,” and also claims that they’re pushing other countries to negotiate.

Surging global bond yields are exerting significant downward pressure on risk assets. Since the U.S. equity sell-off began last Thursday, the Nasdaq has dropped 10%, while bitcoin (BTC) has fared slightly better, down 8% over the same period. In the same time the U.K. 30-year bond yield is up 8%, while the U.S. 30-year is up 12%. Charlie Morris, founder of ByteTree, believes investors will start to seek diversification into other assets including bitcoin. “It appears that the UK has been living beyond its means for too long. It hasn't balanced its budget since 2001, the gilt market has had enough”, Morris said. “Investors seeking diversification away from financial assets will not only buy gold, but bitcoin too”. The dramatic spike in yields has revived unsettling memories of the UK’s 2022 pension crisis, when a sudden surge in borrowing costs triggered a near-collapse of the financial system and ultimately cost then-Prime Minister Liz Truss her job. This latest bond market turmoil is being driven by escalating uncertainty around global trade, stoked by President Donald Trump’s proposed tariff plans. These levies could disrupt global supply chains and increase costs, adding pressure to already jittery markets. “Alas, in politics you never get what you want by making civil arguments from high principle,” former UK MP Steve Baker told CoinDesk in an exclusive interview. “President Trump said he was using brute economic force—and he is. It’s time to rediscover free trade at home and abroad, fast, before this chaos wrecks our futures.” The recent yield surge echoes the events of 2022, when a surprise mini-budget announcement on Sept. 23 sent gilt yields soaring, crashed the pound, and exposed deep vulnerabilities in the UK pension system. Many defined benefit pension schemes had adopted complex liability-driven investment (LDI) strategies, using leverage and derivatives to match long-term liabilities. But as yields spiked, these funds suffered massive mark-to-market losses and faced margin calls, forcing rapid gilt sales into a thin market and creating a destabilizing ""fire sale"" feedback loop. At the time, UK pension funds held around 28% of the gilt market. The ensuing chaos, occurring in a modest $1.5 trillion market, was so severe that it required the Bank of England to step in with emergency gilt purchases to halt the downward spiral. A Chicago Fed Letter analyzing the crisis later identified excessive leverage, asset pooling, and the limited depth of the gilt market as key structural weaknesses—particularly in contrast to the much larger $9.9 trillion U.S. Treasury market.",Markets|pension|Bitcoin|Bond,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-09 11:52:38

As the Trump administration unveiled aggressive global trade levies this month, both traditional markets and crypto assets responded with a sharp pullback. Stocks tumbled, Bitcoin dipped below key levels, and Ethereum tested new local lows. Across the board, fear resurfaced, sending most assets into retreat. But while panic took over in large-cap tokens, one project has quietly managed to preserve its upward momentum: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Still flying under the radar, this emerging DeFi protocol is gaining steady traction as more investors look beyond mainstream assets in search of real utility and future upside. Markets Unsettled, Confidence Shaken The newly imposed tariffs—impacting trade with China, the EU, Japan, and others—sparked immediate reaction across all sectors. U.S. equity futures took a nosedive, crypto market cap contracted sharply, and sentiment turned cautious. Bitcoin and Ethereum dropped alongside broader risk assets, with volatility climbing as uncertainty took the driver’s seat. What became clear in this environment is that many investors are starting to question where their capital is safest—not just in terms of price stability, but in terms of long-term opportunity. And that’s where smaller, value-driven projects like Mutuum Finance are starting to shine. A DeFi Project With Structure and Vision Mutuum Finance isn’t riding on buzz or promises—it’s built around a clear set of real-world use cases. The protocol is currently being developed to offer decentralized lending and borrowing services through audited smart contracts. Unlike platforms that offer flash-in-the-pan hype, Mutuum is designed for consistent yield generation and capital flexibility. Through its upcoming platform, users will be able to deposit digital assets and earn interest, or borrow funds against their existing crypto holdings without needing to sell. The system will include support for multiple asset types, and it aims to introduce a non-custodial, overcollateralized stablecoin—a major step toward creating a more sustainable DeFi environment. This focus on actual financial infrastructure—rather than meme-fueled speculation—is one of the key reasons traders are starting to shift attention to MUTM. Currently priced at just $0.025, MUTM remains accessible, but that window is closing. The project is in its fifth presale phase, having already raised over $6.3 million. More than 8,000 wallets now hold the token, showing a level of organic adoption that few new projects achieve in such a short time. Importantly, this momentum has continued even as major coins stumble under market pressure. While ETH and BTC struggle to hold ground, Mutuum’s consistent presale demand indicates that investor confidence is rooted in the protocol’s roadmap and product utility—not market sentiment. According to the team, Mutuum Finance is gearing up for the beta release of its platform in line with the token’s public launch. This means early participants won’t be left holding a token with no function—they’ll have access to an ecosystem that enables borrowing, lending, and earning immediately. With strong technical foundations, a growing user base, and real features on the horizon, analysts are beginning to see MUTM as more than just another DeFi coin. It’s being positioned as a next-generation tool in the decentralized finance space—designed not only to weather volatility, but to grow through it. As broader markets continue to react to geopolitical decisions and economic policy shifts, capital is flowing more selectively. Projects like Mutuum Finance, with a defined roadmap, clear token utility, and a solid community foundation, are becoming more appealing to those looking for stability and opportunity. In a market clouded by uncertainty, MUTM stands out—not by making noise, but by building steadily. And right now, that approach is starting to turn heads.

According to Blockworks Research , Virtuals Protocol ( VIRTUAL ) has been generating less than $500 per day in revenue from launch and swap fees for the most part of late March and early April. In early January, Virtuals Protocol enjoyed strong revenue generation, with daily earnings from launch and swap fees reaching between $200K and $350K. However, this momentum proved short-lived. In mid-January, revenue began to decline steadily, dipping below $100K per day by the end of the month. By late February, daily revenue had dropped below $10K, and in the final days of March through early April, the platform was generating less than $500 per day. To put it into perspective, Virtuals Protocol’s generated over $500K in daily revenue on Jan. 2, when VIRTUAL hit an all-time high of $5.07. This marks a 99% decrease in daily revenue from its Jan. 2 peak to early April. Source: Blockworks research You might also like: News Virtuals Protocol ecosystem tokens down across the board As for VIRTUAL token’s price , it currently trades at $0.45, 91% down from its ATH. After reaching ATH, VIRTUAL price plunged into a sustained downtrend, with the price falling below key moving averages, eventually settling around $0.45 by early April. A critical technical development occurred when the 20-day Exponential Moving Average crossed below the 50-day Simple Moving Average, strengthening the bearish momentum. Momentum indicators further validate the downtrend. The MACD line remains below the signal line, and although the histogram has started to flatten, it still hovers in negative territory. The Relative Strength Index is at 31.06, just above the oversold threshold of 30.

Despite a 40% stock drop, I now see COIN as a compelling long-term investment, driven by stablecoin growth and diversified transaction revenue. Q4-24 saw a surge in transaction revenue from 'other crypto assets,' reducing reliance on Bitcoin and Ethereum, and boosting retail volume. Base network and stablecoin adoption could significantly enhance Coinbase's future revenue, particularly in merchant payments. Back in early-February, I gave an earnings preview for Coinbase Global, Inc. ( COIN ) and estimated the company would beat analyst expectations of $1.7 billion in Q4-24 revenue and report closer to $2 billion. My own analysis actually under-estimated Coinbase's beat as the company reported just under $2.2 billion in topline revenue last quarter. It was a terrific report for a company that I believe is getting very interesting. This is what I said in the closing section of that earnings preview: In my view, this makes Coinbase a really interesting long term investment idea on the thesis that stablecoins, and specifically USDC, will become a more important part of the global financial system. In spite of that, I'm still not ready to call the company a buy yet given what I view to be headwinds in the company's consumer transaction volume business, but that could change in the future if we see USDC continue to grow in supply and in usage. As fate would have it, those bullish COIN stock longer term now have a dramatically better entry after the stock has fallen by over 40% since my Q4 earnings preview: Data by YCharts COIN's two-month loss is more than double that of both Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and the broader equity market - though each of those have had dismal returns over the same time frame as well. In this article, we'll get into why I'm now upgrading COIN and have taken a small starter position in the company that I plan to hold long term. Q4 Earnings And Looking Ahead My own estimation of Q4 revenue from the Base ecosystem based on these third-party metrics puts 'other transaction revenue' somewhere between $52 and $72 million. Potentially bringing transaction revenue in Q4 right up to $1.4 billion. This quote above is from my Q4 earnings piece. I was sort of close on this. Revenue from other transactions came in at $67.6 million, and total transaction revenue toped $1.5 billion. Base revenue was in line with my expectation, but that $52-72 million range that I provided admittedly left a lot of room for error. Revenue Trend (Coinbase) Full year 2024 transaction revenue of just under $4 billion was a 162% increase over 2023 and Q4 was an enormous reason for that growth with 70.8% of Coinbase's Q4-24 revenue coming from transactions. Subscription and Services revenue growth, while terrific at 64% YoY, was not the largest driver of Coinbase's top line last year. Something that I didn't anticipate from Q4 was the surge higher in transaction revenue from 'other crypto assets.' Trading Revenue (Coinbase) At 49% in the quarter and 57% for the full year, Coinbase's transaction revenue is becoming less reliant on Bitcoin and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ). Collectively, those two assets resulted in 43% of Coinbase's 2024 revenue and just 37% of the company's revenue from Q4. BTC and ETH made up 52% of Coinbase's 2023 revenue and 42% in Q4-23. Coinbase's retail volume came back in a big way in Q4. At 21.4% of total volume, last quarter was Coinbase's largest volume participation from retail since Q1-22. Looking ahead, there shouldn't be much of a drop-off in transaction revenue given the exchange volume in Q1: Coinbase Volume Estimated Revenue January $158,960 $556.36 February $125,620 $439.67 March $102,080 $357.28 Source: The Block, millions Exchange transaction data has Coinbase's Q1 volume at $386.7 billion. If we assume a 0.35% margin on that volume - which would be in line with what Coinbase did in both Q1 and Q4 last year - transaction volume for Q1 should come in close to $1.4 billion before adding revenue from the Base sequencer. Base Network Data My view is that Base has the potential to be a much larger factor for Coinbase longer term. I take that view, in part, because of stablecoin growth and the role those products can have in payments for merchants. Peer-to-peer payments is an uphill climb due to the ease of use from platforms like Cash App ( XYZ ) or Venmo ( PYPL ), but merchants that use companies like Stripe to process credit card payments could save quite a bit annually by accepting USDC for payments. Processing Savings (AcceptUSDC) Consider what a small business that generates $10 million in annualized sales could save by eliminating credit card processing fees. The example above shows over $16,600 in monthly savings for a company that does half its sales with credit cards. Again, this is just a loose estimate, and it's certainly not a guarantee that Base would be the desired blockchain for USD Coin ( USDC-USD ) payments. Though I suspect Coinbase's stake in the coin's issuer Circle likely plays some factor. At $9.5 billion in token supply, Solana ( SOL-USD ) has more than double the USDC footprint that Base has. Yet, Base has been highly competitive in transfer volume. Stable Supply vs Volume (Artemis) The graphic above shows that Solana has grown the share of stablecoins relative to Base over the last four months. However, Base has been the top blockchain in the ecosystem for stablecoin velocity, with just under $4 trillion in stable transfer volume year to date. However, that transfer volume for Base has normalized more recently. Regardless, Base stablecoin supply continues to grow nonetheless: Base Stablecoin Supply (Defi Llama) With $4.2 billion in stables, Base is the fifth ranked chain by stablecoin footprint and the largest ETH scaling chain by stable supply. Importantly, almost 92% of this supply is USDC. Again, since Coinbase has an ownership stake in Circle, it behooves the company to incentivize USDC supply growth over other stablecoin products. Base Fees vs MAAs (Token Terminal) Admittedly, Base fees were down in March. For the full quarter, I'd expect somewhere between a 5-10% QoQ reduction in Base sequencer revenue. The important thing though is monthly active addresses are holding firm and averaged about 20.5 million monthly actives in Q1. For me, the main takeaway here is that users are still present, and stablecoin footprint is growing. Fees will be cyclical. But a user base that is sticking around a growing stablecoin supply are ultimately positive signs. Valuation Another positive sign in my view is the multiple compression we've seen in COIN stock. I've made no bones about calling COIN overvalued for quite some time, and it has been my primary reason for not taking a long-term position in the stock despite being encouraged by what I view to be a positive fundamental setup for Coinbase the company. Data by YCharts Look, I'm still not going to call COIN 'cheap' at forward sales and forward earnings multiples of 5 and 20 respectively. But the equity is trading at 52-week lows in both forward PS and PE multiples. With a valuation grade of 'D' from Seeking Alpha, there is still valuation risk in longing COIN at these multiples. The question is whether or not the company can grow into this valuation without too much stress on the equity price. Data by YCharts I think that could indeed happen. The company just had its best year by operating and net income since 2021 and the early indications from the publicly available trading data would imply Q1-25 should be another strong quarter for Coinbase. Investor Takeaways Data by YCharts The US equity market is still enduring a massive drawdown. The Nasdaq ( COMP:IND ) has fallen by over 25% in a little over one month. The primary risk to longing COIN after a 52% retracement from December highs would be that the global markets are in (or entering) a recession and demand for digital assets and cryptocurrencies would absolutely lose out to food and shelter when incomes are reduced or outright lost. To be clear, I do think this is a very legitimate concern. However, I question how much pain tolerance there will be from a market that is addicted to cheap money. The Federal Reserve may be pressured to lower rates and raise liquidity before a recession is evident in the economic data. COIN could certainly go lower, which is why I'm personally nowhere close to what I view as a 'full position.' But I'm comfortable in upgrading COIN from a 'hold' to a 'buy' after a strong 2024 and significant multiple compression in just four months.",COIN,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|USDC,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-04-09 11:56:32

However, the reality so far has been a constant downtrend, with prices hitting all-time low. Will this token rebound? Let’s find out in this ARB price prediction. Table of Contents What is Arbitrum? Arbitrum short-term price prediction Arbitrum coin price prediction: short-term outlook ARB price factors for April 2025 Currently ranked at the 54th position with a market cap of $1.23 billion, Arbitrum ( ARB ) has depreciated around 88% in price, since reaching an all-time high of $2.40 in January 2025. The token has seen a lot of range, and downtrend so far, with long term investors still hopeful on the return of this layer-2 platform. ARB 1d chart | Source: crypto.news In this article, we’ll discuss the ARB price prediction by giving you its short and price forecasts, and specifically focus on Arbitrum price prediction in April 2025. What is Arbitrum? Arbitrum is a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum. To accomplish its objective of increasing speed, scalability, and cost-efficiency on Ethereum ( ETH ), it makes use of optimistic rollups. The compatibility and security of ETH are advantageous to Arbitrum. The increased throughput and reduced fees in comparison to ETHare further advantages. Moving the majority of the compute and storage load off-chain enables that. The native token of Arbitrum, known as ARB, is utilized for governance. The developers of Arbitrum, Offchain Labs, declared that the Arbitrum DAO will be the first decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) structure. ARB holders have the ability to vote on proposals that impact the election of a Security Council, features, protocol updates, and funding distribution. Now let’s discuss ARB price prediction in April 2025 both from a technical point of view and also look into some fundamental factors that could affect the price as well.

Let’s analyze this token for a short term outlook and then discuss Arbitrum price prediction in April 2025. Arbitrum coin price prediction: short-term outlook According to CoinCodex’s ARB price prediction for the near future, the token is predicted to rise by 226.07% and reach $1.086875 by Apr. 28, 2025. This is a prediction that has a very low probability, considering the downtrend of cryptocurrency and all other financial markets as well. Analysts on X believe ARB is in accumulation mode and getting ready for a big breakout, similar to what happened in the summer of 2024. $ARB It's summer of 2024 again 🙂 pic.twitter.com/kKQ2HeT7qs — polaris_xbt (@polaris_xbt) April 7, 2025 $Arb .. pic.twitter.com/DCsei6VpRq — lone wolf 🐺 (@lonewolf_1987) April 5, 2025 Others are frustrated that their airdrop, which was worth a lot when Arbitrum did its airdrop, is now almost 2x down from its all-time high. some people are still holding their $ARB airdrop waiting for $2. 😭 pic.twitter.com/20d6FrSjzc — King.sol 🇶🇦 (@teddi_speaks) April 8, 2025 ARB price factors for April 2025 Looking ahead to April 2025, market mood, ETH’s upgrades, and legislative changes will all have a significant impact on Arbitrum’s price. ARB’s future hinges on a possible market rebound and a resurgence of optimism following a precipitous drop in early 2025. Arbitrum may gain if ETH’s upgrades, which increase scalability and lower costs, are successful. Any ETH-related delays or problems, though, would further hurt ARB. Another factor is the decentralized governance mechanism of Arbitrum. The price of ARB and investor confidence may be impacted by any significant protocol changes or DAO decisions. Furthermore, the regulatory landscape is still unclear. Stricter regulations may impede expansion, while more lenient ones may increase institutional interest. Price movement will also be influenced by the sentiment of ARB holders, particularly those who received the airdrop. Selling pressure could result from frustration, but accumulation and purchasing interest could result from a favorable change. In the end, a combination of these elements will determine ARB’s price in April; a recovery is feasible, but it will necessitate positive developments in all areas.

Before investing in any cryptocurrency including ARB , please identify and understand the inherent risks that can come due to market volatility. Also, it should be noted that the sentiment in the cryptocurrency market changes quickly, and a price point that was once considered a very strong support or resistance may become invalid in a very short time. Hence it is advisable to do your research on the price action before having any price expectations for the future of the ARB token. Will Arbitrum go up or down? Cryptocurrencies in general experience rapid price swings that are directly driven by market sentiments, community engagement, events like token burns, and so on. While it is hard to determine how high the ARB token will go, it is important to look out for potential buying factors that may include new partnerships, increased token holders, or viral campaigns in general. It is also vital that you rely on financial experts and consult them for ARB price prediction, but even after all that, you should remain cautious as no one can accurately predict how high or low ARB can go. Should I invest in Arbitrum? Before investing in any cryptocurrency or trusting any ARB price forecast, please identify and understand the inherent risks that can come due to market volatility. Also, it should be noted that cryptocurrencies in general are a highly speculative investment and their success not only relies on market volatility but also on the constant and sustainable growth of its community. Hence it is advisable to do your research on the token’s fundamentals which may very well decide the future of the XRP token. Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

Volatility remains high, with the VIX (Volatility Index) holding above 40 points for the third consecutive session. Traditional protective assets have ceased to fulfill their function. Low-risk assets are not providing sufficient protection: gold and US bonds are selling off as investors seek to reduce risk and meet margin requirements. The Trump administration's strategy to refinance U.S. debt at lower rates is showing signs of strain - yields have risen across the curve. The yield on 10-year US Treasuries peaked at 4.50%, while 30-year yields briefly exceeded 5%. Credit spreads continue to widen, reflecting a general deterioration in risk sentiment. Instead of changing course, President Trump appears to be employing a martingale strategy, doubling down on every counter move. With China holding most of the leverage, one wonders what other economic resources the U.S. is willing to bring to bear in this standoff. Markets are now oscillating between two potential sources of support: either an easing of the Trump administration's tariff policy or Fed action to lower rates. However, neither of these lifesaving solutions are foreseen in the near future. With unemployment remaining stable and inflation showing signs of resurgence, the Fed is likely to maintain current rates for the foreseeable future. This is contrary to market expectations of four rate cuts in 2025, including speculation of a possible extraordinary cut. Cryptocurrency market status Bitcoin is holding above $75 000, but that stability could end if stock markets fall sharply again. Ethereum continues to perform worse than the market, drifting towards the $1 400 mark, a level last seen in early 2023. Curry trade in cryptocurrencies Amid heightened volatility, carry-trade in cryptocurrencies is coming to the forefront. QCP Capital notes that elevated implied volatility creates an attractive window to get a curry trade via structured trades. A carry trade is a strategy in which a trader borrows funds at a low interest rate and invests them in an asset with a high yield. In the context of cryptocurrencies and options, this can mean selling options (puts or calls) to earn a premium, especially when implied volatility is high. Such strategies work as follows: A trader sells options with a strike price far from the current market price of bitcoin or Ethereum Receives a premium from the sale of the options If the asset price remains within a certain range, the options expire worthless and the trader keeps the premium The advantage of this strategy in the current environment is that high implied volatility means higher option premiums, potentially increasing returns. However, the risk is that if the market moves strongly in the direction of the options sold, the trader could suffer significant losses. Given the current market conditions, cryptocurrency curry trading can provide an alternative source of profit during times of high uncertainty. However, it is important to note that such strategies require careful risk management and an understanding of the options markets. Macroeconomic tensions between the US and China continue to put pressure on global markets. Traditional protective assets are failing in their role, forcing investors to look for alternative strategies. Against this background, the cryptocurrency market demonstrates relative stability, despite a slight decline in Ethereum.",News|Business,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-09 11:57:19

The U.S. SEC has officially confirmed that the Ripple lawsuit is now fully in the appeal phase. In a letter to Judge Analisa Torres, the agency urged the court to reject a new emergency filing from Justin Keener—an outside individual previously sued by the SEC—who requested to present what he called “decisive evidence” in the case. According to the SEC, such a request is improper because the district court no longer has authority over the matters in question, which are currently being reviewed by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. Crypto lawyer Bill Morgan recently highlighted a strange contradiction in the ongoing Ripple vs SEC case that’s raising fresh doubts about where things actually stand. Such an odd thing that Ripple say the Appeal and Cross-Appeal is settled but the SEC writes to Judge Torres that the matter is still on appeal. Settled but not quite over. https://t.co/TpNv2DcKoE pic.twitter.com/XFAKJAzUUP — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) April 9, 2025 The Mysterious Filing and SEC’s Reaction It all started when Justin W. Keener, who previously faced legal trouble from the SEC, submitted a surprise filing in the Ripple case. Keener claimed he had key evidence that could influence the outcome of the lawsuit. However, legal analysts quickly dismissed it as irrelevant, with some even calling it “spam.” Still, the SEC took the time to respond, saying the filing was improper and should be denied because the case is still under appeal. That’s where things got confusing. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price Prediction 2025-2028: Standard Chartered Sees 500% Surge! , Wait—Is the Appeal Still Alive? The SEC’s official response stated that the court no longer has jurisdiction over the matter because it’s still being appealed. But Ripple had previously told the court that both the SEC’s appeal and Ripple’s cross-appeal were settled. That means either someone is mistaken—or the two sides don’t agree on whether the case is truly over. Bill Morgan called this contradiction “odd,” and it’s now fueling more uncertainty around the final outcome. One community member, Danny, hinted that something major could be happening behind the scenes, pointing to the urgency of the mysterious emergency filing. Why It Matters However, this isn’t just a paperwork issue. The XRP lawsuit is a big deal for the entire crypto market. How it ends could shape how U.S. regulators treat other digital assets in the future. With one side saying the legal battle is settled and the other claiming it’s still ongoing, there’s more confusion than clarity at the moment. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The world of traditional finance is sending shockwaves, and it’s all rippling into our digital domain. The mighty US dollar, a cornerstone of global trade, is experiencing a significant dollar slump . But what’s fueling this downturn, and more importantly, how does it connect to the volatile world of cryptocurrencies? Let’s dive into the brewing storm – the intensifying US-China trade war . What’s Behind the Dollar Slump? Unpacking the US-China Trade War Impact The ongoing trade dispute between the United States and China isn’t just headlines; it’s a major economic earthquake. Think of it like this: two global giants, locked in a battle of tariffs and trade restrictions. This friction is creating ripples across the financial landscape, and one of the most visible effects is the weakening of the US dollar. Here’s a breakdown of how the US-China trade war is contributing to the dollar slump : Increased Uncertainty: Trade wars breed uncertainty. Businesses become hesitant to invest, supply chains are disrupted, and future economic growth becomes cloudy. This uncertainty makes investors wary of holding dollar-denominated assets, leading to a decrease in demand for the dollar. Reduced Exports: Tariffs imposed by both sides in the trade war make goods more expensive. When US exports become pricier due to retaliatory tariffs from China, demand for these goods decreases. This, in turn, can weaken the dollar as there’s less international demand for it to purchase US goods. Safe-Haven Currencies Gain: In times of economic uncertainty, investors often flock to safe-haven assets. While the dollar is traditionally considered a safe haven, the trade war itself is partly originating from the US, diluting its safe-haven appeal. This pushes investors towards other currencies or assets, further contributing to the dollar slump . Potential for Currency Devaluation: In extreme scenarios, countries might consider currency devaluation to make their exports cheaper and more competitive. While the US hasn’t explicitly signaled this, the trade war tensions raise concerns about potential currency manipulations, adding downward pressure on the dollar. Currency Devaluation: A Double-Edged Sword? Currency devaluation , essentially a deliberate lowering of a currency’s value, is a tool countries sometimes use to boost their economies. But is it always beneficial? Let’s weigh the pros and cons: Benefits of Currency Devaluation Challenges of Currency Devaluation Boosts Exports: Devalued currency makes exports cheaper for foreign buyers, increasing demand and potentially stimulating economic growth. Reduces Imports: Imports become more expensive, encouraging domestic consumption and production. Attracts Investment: Cheaper assets can attract foreign investment. Inflation: Import prices rise, leading to higher inflation, eroding purchasing power. Increased Debt Burden: For countries with significant dollar-denominated debt, a currency devaluation against the dollar makes debt repayment more expensive. Loss of Confidence: Frequent devaluations can erode investor confidence in a currency and the economy. For the US, deliberate currency devaluation is a complex issue with significant political and economic ramifications. However, the market forces driven by the US-China trade war are already pushing the dollar downwards. Impact on the Global Economy: Are We Heading for a Downturn? The dollar slump and the US-China trade war are not isolated events. They have far-reaching consequences for the global economy . Here’s how: Slower Global Growth: Trade disputes disrupt global supply chains, reduce business confidence, and dampen investment, all contributing to slower global economic growth. Emerging Markets Vulnerability: Many emerging market economies rely on dollar-denominated debt. A stronger dollar (though currently we see a dollar slump ) makes this debt more expensive to service. However, a sudden dollar slump can also cause instability if it leads to capital flight or rapid currency fluctuations in these markets. Commodity Price Fluctuations: Commodities are often priced in dollars. A weaker dollar can lead to higher commodity prices, potentially contributing to inflation globally. Increased Market Volatility: Uncertainty surrounding trade and currency valuations leads to increased volatility in financial markets , impacting stocks, bonds, and yes, even cryptocurrencies. Financial Markets and Crypto: Riding the Wave of Dollar Volatility So, how does all this relate to the crypto world? Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, are often touted as alternative assets, a hedge against traditional financial markets and fiat currency instability. When the dollar weakens, and traditional markets experience jitters, investors often look for alternatives. Here’s the potential connection to crypto: Increased Crypto Appeal: A dollar slump and volatility in traditional markets can make cryptocurrencies appear more attractive as alternative stores of value or investment vehicles. Inflation Hedge Narrative: If the dollar slump leads to inflation, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, with their limited supply, could be seen as a hedge against inflation, further driving demand. Market Diversification: Crypto offers diversification away from traditional assets tied to the dollar and the global economy . In times of uncertainty, diversification is key. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Dollar Slump and Trade War Turbulence What can you do to navigate these turbulent times? Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on developments in the US-China trade war and their impact on the dollar and the global economy . Diversify Your Portfolio: Consider diversifying your investments across different asset classes, including cryptocurrencies, to mitigate risk. Manage Risk: Volatility is likely to remain elevated. Implement robust risk management strategies in your trading and investment activities. Long-Term Perspective: Focus on the long-term potential of your investments and avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term market fluctuations. Conclusion: Uncertainty and Opportunity in a Shifting Global Landscape The dollar slump , fueled by the intensifying US-China trade war , paints a picture of uncertainty in the global economy . While this situation presents challenges, it also unveils potential opportunities. For the cryptocurrency space, it could be a moment to shine, showcasing its potential as an alternative asset in a world grappling with traditional financial market volatility. Staying informed, adapting to the changing landscape, and maintaining a balanced perspective are crucial as we navigate these complex economic currents.

The projections, shared by Geoffrey Kendrick, Standard Chartered’s global head of digital assets research, map out annual target levels for XRP, Bitcoin, and Ethereum through 2029. They also indicate a set of key ratios that measure the relative strength of XRP compared to its more established peers. XRP, BTC And ETH Price Predictions In 2025, XRP is expected to reach $5.50, while Bitcoin is forecasted to soar to $200,000 and Ethereum to $4,000. This sets a BTC-XRP ratio—essentially the number of tokens equivalent in value to one Bitcoin—at roughly 39,500. Ethereum would be valued at about 727 times the price of XRP in the same year. Moving into 2026, XRP’s target jumps to $8.00, an almost 45% increase, while Bitcoin is projected to climb to $300,000 and Ethereum to $5,000. The BTC-XRP and ETH-XRP ratios slightly rise and fall respectively, suggesting that while Bitcoin continues to outpace XRP in relative terms, XRP is gaining ground on Ethereum. Related Reading: This Analyst Correctly Called The XRP Price Crash, Here Are The Next Targets By 2027, XRP is expected to trade at $10.40, Bitcoin at $400,000, and Ethereum at $6,000. While XRP’s price nearly doubles from its 2025 level, the BTC-XRP and ETH-XRP ratios (42,000 and 577 respectively) confirm a tightening of the gap, particularly versus Ethereum, where XRP shows stronger relative performance. In 2028, XRP hits its peak in this forecast at $12.50. Bitcoin reaches $500,000 and Ethereum continues its linear ascent to $7,500. Despite the increase, XRP still lags behind in proportional gains to Bitcoin, with the BTC-XRP ratio ticking up to 43,000. However, the ETH-XRP ratio moves slightly higher to 600, signaling that Ethereum begins to regain a bit of ground against XRP. Interestingly, by 2029, Kendrick is projecting a slight decline for XRP to $12.25. Meanwhile, the Standard Chartered analyst predicts Bitcoin to remain flat at $500,000, while Ethereum holds steady at $7,500. Notably, the ETH-XRP ratio increases slightly to 612, and BTC-XRP to 44,500, reflecting a modest erosion of XRP’s relative strength in the final stretch. Still, compared to 2025, XRP ends the forecast period stronger in relative terms against Ethereum, as shown by the ETH-XRP ratio dropping from 727 to 612. XRP Will Flip Ethereum Kendrick’s prediction of XRP overtaking Ethereum in total market cap represents one of the report’s most attention-grabbing assertions. “By the end of 2028 we see XRP’s market cap overtaking Ethereum’s,” he said in a message to The Block. Kendrick attributes this upward trajectory to a confluence of factors, including regulatory developments, growing institutional adoption, and expanding tokenization use cases. He specifically cites Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s announcement that the US Securities and Exchange Commission has dropped its appeal in the long-running case. According to Kendrick, this outcome was anticipated in the aftermath of a crypto-friendly stance from Donald Trump’s administration, which he says paved the way for a more favorable regulatory environment. He also expects the SEC to approve an XRP spot ETF by Q3 2025, with possible inflows of up to $8 billion in the first year of listing. Related Reading: XRP Confirms Head And Shoulders Breakdown: How Low Can It Go? Kendrick argues that the token’s fundamental utility in cross-border and cross-currency payments aligns with one of the most rapidly growing use cases in the digital asset space. He observes that stablecoin transaction volumes have surged by roughly 50% each year and, if that growth is mirrored by XRP, the token’s price could climb steadily over the coming years. In parallel, Ripple is moving deeper into tokenization efforts, including the development of tokenized US Treasury bill funds and its own USD-backed stablecoin, RLUSD, which Kendrick believes could bolster XRP’s position further. “XRP’s blockchain, the XRP Ledger, is a payments chain and may become a tokenisation chain,” he said. Despite these promising signs, Kendrick acknowledges that the developer ecosystem remains relatively small compared to those of Ethereum and other major blockchains, which could present a challenge to widespread adoption. Moreover, the token’s low-fee structure, while an attractive feature for payments, might limit its ability to capture additional value from network usage. Notably, Kendrick recently also released an optimistic note about Avalanche’s native token AVAX, projecting it could surge to $250 by 2029. His outlook on Ethereum, however, is less enthusiastic; he recently slashed his 2025 Ether price target by 60% to $4,000 and described ether as an “identified loser,” while championing Bitcoin and AVAX as “identified winners.” At press time, XRP traded at $1.807.

On April 9, Taurus said in an announcement shared with Cointelegraph that it had launched Taurus-Network (TN), an interbank network designed to simplify and improve digital asset transactions between regulated financial institutions worldwide. The network aims to improve collateral mobility, optimize settlement speed and reduce counterparty risk while benefiting capital and liquidity management in digital assets. Among the key benefits of the network is the ability for participants to retain full sovereignty over assets, direct interaction with counterparties and automated compliance without third-party intervention, Taurus SA’s head of product infrastructure, Vassili Lavrov, told Cointelegraph. Multiple banks already involved The Taurus-Network launches with participation from several banks worldwide, including Arab Bank Switzerland, Capital Union Bank, Flowdesk, ISP Group, Misyon Bank and Swissquote. According to Lavrov, all of those banks have taken meaningful steps to integrate digital asset capabilities within their operations, with most of them already offering custody of cryptocurrencies to their clients. “By building on Taurus’ relationships with over 35 banking clients across four continents, the network is positioned to become the default infrastructure layer for compliant, high-trust digital asset activity,” he said. A blockchain-agnostic network As Taurus expects to tap major global regulated financial institutions for its network, the firm ensures that interoperability is among its core strengths. Taurus-Network is blockchain-agnostic and supports both public and permissioned distributed ledger technologies, Lavrov said, adding: “It’s engineered to enable seamless interaction across different digital asset types, whether cryptocurrencies, tokenized securities, or digital currencies.” He added that the network is designed to interoperate across public and permissioned blockchains, so institutions “aren’t locked into one system.” This is a developing story, and further information will be added as it becomes available.

43121683,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=707813,1744200356,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/43121683.jpeg,"France faces recession fears from Trump tariffs, Head of France’s Medef warns",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/france-faces-recession-from-tariffs-medef/,"Patrick Martin, who leads France’s influential business lobby group Medef, said Wednesday that the new tariffs could push the country into a recession. The 65-year-old French business executive is worried about the country’s economy facing President Donald Trump’s tariff-ridden market. French businesses must contend with US export levies on steel, aluminum, and other goods used in aerospace, luxury goods, and cosmetics. Martin is asking the French government to enact strategies to help French-based companies’ competitiveness to stay afloat. “ The risk is that growth will stall and that we go into a recession ,” Martin told RTL radio. “ We must act quickly to improve the competitiveness of French businesses, which includes protecting consumption without overburdening taxpayers, households, and businesses .” Recession threats persist as EU-US trade war ensues Martin’s plea to the French government comes against the backdrop of frictions between the US and Europe over trade policies. Some policymakers, like French Industry Minister Marc Ferracci, have supported Martin’s concerns, proposing to help alleviate the burden on companies by reducing production taxes. Speaking to Franceinfo, Ferracci requested French firms to consider suspending investments in the US because of the trade conflict. “ The situation is highly complicated, and investments that were once secure are now in question ,” Ferracci added. France President Emmanuel Macron has also slated the feasibility of Trump’s trade policies, coining them a “bad idea” that could worsen the already jittery global economic relations. The country, along with other EU nations, faces a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum and a 20% tariff on several products. “ We have never wished for chaos or higher tariffs ,” Macron said during his visit to Egypt. “ We think it’s a poor response to the trade deficit and will defend our economy against these tariffs. ” Macron reiterated that France could eventually respond to the US tariffs with retaliation, but the focus of his administration will be to make reforms to increase competitiveness rather than engaging in a tit-for-tat tariff tussle. Bank of France raises Q1 growth estimate, says tariff consequences are unclear In other developments, the Bank of France raised its estimate for first-quarter growth on Monday, reporting a 0.2% expansion between January and March. Still, the central bank mentioned it was unclear how much US tariffs would affect the French economy in the long term. According to the Bank of France, the European nation’s manufacturing sector performed better than expected in March, and some industries, including luxury goods and alcoholic beverages, managed to front-load deliveries to America in anticipation of the tariffs. However, the central bank admitted that tariffs have caused an increase in risk perceptions across all sectors, where industries have started preparing for financial impacts. “ I must insist that this snapshot of first-quarter data does not predict what will happen in the second quarter, ” said Olivier Garnier, an economist with the Bank of France. “ The uncertainty is real, and it will likely intensify as the tariff impacts become clearer .” Inflation holds steady, Euro growth pauses France’s inflation rate in March remained unchanged for the most part, with the annual rate persisting at 0.8%. It faced some reprieve from rising service and food prices, especially for fresh products, which were somewhat offset by falling energy prices. The EU-harmonized inflation rate, which tracks price changes across member states, also held steady at 0.9%. The bloc has been actively seeking ways to counteract the impact of US tariffs, with the European Commission proposing a “zero-for-zero” tariff deal to the Trump administration. Sources from Washington said the White House has rejected the offer, so the EU is reportedly gearing up to slap American-based goods with a 25% rate. European equity markets took quite the hit on Wednesday morning trading session, with the STOXX 600 index dropping 3.4%, wiping out around 2% of the gains from the previous day. The losses spread across several sectors. Shares of pharmaceutical companies Novo Nordisk, Novartis and AstraZeneca went down 4.2%, 7.3%, and 5.3% respectively. On the currency front, data from TradingEconomics show the EUR/USD exchange rate rose by 0.0071, or 0.65%, to reach 1.1032, a slight uptick from yesterday’s ending session level of 1.0961.

These feelings also extend to MicroStrategy (now ""Strategy""), which leverages debt to buy Bitcoin, emerging as a bullish, ""leveraged"" bet on BTC. The Defiance Daily Target 2x Long MSTR ETF offers even further leverage on MSTR, and therefore BTC. However, it is a very poor investment. I am issuing a strong sell on MSTX for several reasons, which I discuss in this article. Leveraged ETFs are very dangerous to investors and traders alike, especially those on single stocks. Introduction Regular readers of mine will know that I have mixed feelings about non-productive, speculative assets like Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). I've never given BTC itself a buy rating , and I recently discussed how I've completely liquidated all of my cryptocurrency holdings. Before it ran up 93% from the date of my coverage, I gave ""Bitcoin Development Company"" MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) a hold rating as well. Seeking Alpha Sometimes, it pays not to listen to me, turns out. Had folks disregarded my advice to avoid MicroStrategy stock — which I believe is just ""Strategy"" now, based on the Seeking Alpha articles released about it recently — they would've made bank. There may be some point to being my contrarian at times; I'm not always right. However, some investors who were correct about MSTR may have lost out immensely by choosing to juice up their exposure with the Defiance Daily Target 2x Long MSTR ETF (NASDAQ: MSTX ). Since that article was published, here's how they both have performed: Data by YCharts I could say that this fund ""does what it says on the tin,"" which is my new favorite saying regarding leveraged ETFs since reading this report from my colleague Seeking Vol. The fund ""seeks daily leveraged investment results of two times the daily percentage change in the share price of MicroStrategy Incorporated ((MSTR))..."" according to its provider, Defiance ETFs . This daily effect means that over long periods of time, we can see exactly what we see that in the chart above, with long-term underperformance despite overwhelmingly positive returns in the underlying. While MSTR itself is up over 100%, the volatility of the stock eroded MSTX's return down to 52%. Truth be told, the fund can, in very short spurts, duplicate the exposure across multiple days. It makes no promises, however, and this may be a coincidence over the last five days. Data by YCharts Otherwise, it is really only daily leverage. That means that this instrument is only suitable for day trading, as it cannot be routinely trusted to create leverage in the right direction over time. This shouldn't be news to the leveraged ETF community, who may often choose to disregard warnings from the SEC , such as: Leveraged and inverse ETFs typically are designed to achieve their stated performance objectives on a daily basis. Some investors might invest in these ETFs with the expectation that the ETFs may meet their stated daily performance objectives over the long term as well. Investors should be aware that the performance of these ETFs over a period longer than one day can differ significantly from their stated daily performance objectives and may potentially expose investors to significant and sudden losses. Additionally, there are also prospectus-level warnings: The Fund is not suitable for all investors. The Fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged (2X) investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage, and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. The Fund is not intended to be used by and is not appropriate for, investors who do not intend to actively monitor and manage their portfolios. Volatility Drag in Leveraged ETFs One of the reasons that MSTX has failed to outperform MSTR over its lifespan despite MSTR itself doubling during that time is that the performance of leveraged funds cause volatility drag (or ""volatility inflation"" depending on your take). Smarter men than I have already covered this, so I first want to thank Aptus Capital Advisors for publishing a case study on MSTX. In that study, Aptus first explained volatility drag itself: The difference between arithmetic and geometric returns helps explain why leveraged ETFs often underperform expectations. Here are some examples of how each is calculated: Arithmetic Return: A simple average of returns, which does not account for compounding. Example: The arithmetic return of -10% and +10% is: (−10%+10%) / 2 = 0% Geometric Return ((CAGR)): Incorporates compounding and represents the true growth rate of an investment. Example: The geometric return of -10% followed by +10% is: (1−10%)×(1+10%)=0.99−1=−1% Since geometric returns account for the compounding effect, volatility negatively impacts long-term performance—this phenomenon is known as volatility drag and is especially relevant for leveraged ETFs. A simplified formula for the geometric mean return is: Geometric mean = Arithmetic mean – (StdDev² / 2) Volatility creates a “drag” on returns, which worsens with higher leverage. An example for an asset with 50% volatility: Unlevered: 50%² / 2 = 12.5% drag Daily leverage: (50% x 2) = 100%² / 2 = 50% drag In this example, with 2x leverage the drag quadruples, require exceptionally high arithmetic returns to offset it. Aptus Capital Advisors So if volatility drag is a natural part of leverage, why does it matter beyond us understanding that it means returns won't be perfect? Well, it helps us see just how dangerous this factor can be when applied to instruments that are too volatile (e.g., MicroStrategy). Because MSTR is so volatile, the drag that MSTX generates is so much greater than that of many other leveraged funds, where this drag has a far lower effect on the fund. MSTR's volatility exaggerates this effect dramatically, and it results in terrible performance compared to the long-term returns of MSTR itself. Aptus did a 5yr backtest where they simulated MSTX's strategy to demonstrate how this would have affected MSTX terribly even before its launch in 2024. They were even kind to MSTX by assuming that there was no cost or friction associated with the leverage (which is not true in the real world). Aptus Capital Advisors If you want more info about this phenomenon and why it makes these kinds of leveraged instruments undesirable, but doesn't make all leverage unattractive, I recommend this article from Corey Hoffstein , founder of Return Stacked Portfolio Solutions, the folks behind now-famous leveraged ETFs RSBT , RSSB , and others. MSTX Holdings The strange behavior of the fund is partially a mathematical issue with volatility drag, but also because of the variety of tools necessary to create the proper leverage. The fund has to employ several swaps, call options, and a long stock position to achieve its target leverage, which all incur their own costs and drag. Defiance ETFs This is not unusual behavior for a leveraged ETF, but most successful leveraged ETFs were built atop indexes that are far less volatile than MSTR is. They suffer less from volatility drag, and the other costs of leverage employed on more-thinly traded securities like MSTR compared to an index like the Nasdaq 100 with TQQQ . MSTR Is Already Leveraged One of the core issues I want to raise here for investors considering MSTR as an alternative to the leveraged version (given that you agree with my sell thesis on MSTX and would avoid it even if you are bullish on MSTR) is that the company itself operates as a leveraged bet on Bitcoin. As I covered in my past article on MSTR, the company issues convertible debt to buy Bitcoin as its central strategy. This means that the company dilutes its own shareholders in order to buy Bitcoin, with shareholders hoping that Bitcoin appreciates more than they are diluted, resulting in outsized gains compared to buying Bitcoin on your own. MSTR, as large as it is, has access to more favorable debt rates than consumers, and so acts as cheaper Bitcoin leverage than margin for most investors. I don't believe that this is a prudent strategy, leading to my hold rating on MSTR that I am still maintaining regardless of its performance. Suitability To that end, I am giving a strong sell rating to MSTX on its inability to capture the long-term trends of MSTR. While it does provide for daily and even multi-day accurately leveraged exposure (up to several days in a row, but no promises), it is just a trading tool. Leveraging an already leveraged asset in MSTR is not a winning proposition due to the volatility drag/inflation that occurs in trading, leading to worse outcomes than a simple long stock position in MSTR. I cannot recommend any investor hold MSTX, and believe that investors are far better served by investing in MSTR outright. Even to that end, I do not recommend buying MSTR, and instead recommend holding Bitcoin inside a productive, no-upside-cap wrapper like the MAXI ETF . However, currently, I have eliminated all of my speculative and risky asset exposure, and so I am no longer holding MAXI either in our current market environment. Conclusion Ultimately, the Defiance Daily Target 2x Long MSTR ETF is not a suitable vehicle for any investor and has earned a strong sell from me, due to its increased exposure to volatility drag that has resulted in performance longer than a day or several days at most being heavily distorted from its underlying asset such that it can dramatically underperform even during positive periods for MicroStrategy. I am not bullish on MSTR itself, which furthers my counter-recommendation for MSTX. MSTR employs leverage on its own, which I believe is irresponsible and unlikely to play out well given my long-term bearish view of Bitcoin. In the short term, I am also bearish on MSTR and Bitcoin as I see further pain and volatility to come to markets due to our current geopolitical trade tensions .

Others are casting doubt on that projection. In June 2024, Standard Chartered Bank and Synpulse predicted that RWAs may reach over $30 trillion by 2034. The narrative remained strong in the latter part of 2024, with some analysts expressing similar sentiments . At Paris Blockchain Week 2025, a panel moderated by Cointelegraph’s managing editor, Gareth Jenkinson, brought together executives from across the tokenization ecosystem to discuss the future of RWAs. Participants included Charles Adkins of Hedera, Dotun Rominiyi from the London Stock Exchange, Shy Datika of INX, Steven Gaertner of Tiamonds and Securitize chief operating officer Michael Sonnenshein. While the majority supported the $30 trillion estimate, Sonnenshein expressed skepticism. The Truth Behind Tokenization and RWA panel. Source: Paris Blockchain Week Securitize exec predicts a more conservative trajectory for RWAs Sonnenshein, a former CEO of Grayscale Investments , said tokenized assets may not reach the $30 trillion mark. He argued that there are many “good systems” in place that already work for traditional assets: “I have to just say, at the moment there obviously are some really good systems in place that allow some of these assets to trade. So, just because it can be tokenized doesn’t mean that it should be. And so, I’ll take the under on the $30 trillion number.” Despite being an outlier in his predictions, Sonnenshein said he’s still bullish on RWAs, adding that his sentiment “doesn’t mean that tokenization isn’t here to stay.” Sonnenshein said that the space will still see a major explosion of investors who will see their wallets as not just a place for crypto speculation but also a “place that actually houses investments of theirs the way their brokerage accounts or investment accounts would as well.” Related: BlackRock’s BUIDL expands to Solana as tokenized money market fund nears $2B Tokenization doesn’t “translate well” to representing real estate ownership Sonnenshein also questioned the viability of real estate as a primary use case for RWAs. In the United Arab Emirates, government agencies have made moves to link tokenization with real estate . In January, local real estate developer Damac signed a $1 billion deal with RWA blockchain Mantra to tokenize real estate in the UAE. While some put their money on tokenized real estate, Sonnenshein cast doubt on the idea. “I’ll be the controversial one up here and just say I don’t think tokenization should have its eyes directly set on real estate,” he said during the panel. While the executive recognized the benefits of tokenizing real estate, he argued that this doesn’t translate well to representing ownership. “I’m sure there are all kinds of efficiencies that can be unlocked using blockchain technology to eliminate middlemen and escrow and all kinds of things in real estate. But I think today, what the onchain economy is demanding are more liquid assets,” he added.

Just when you thought the global crypto landscape couldn’t get any more interesting, news breaks from Eastern Europe that’s sending ripples through the digital asset world. Ukraine, a nation already navigating unprecedented challenges, is now proposing a significant overhaul of its crypto taxation framework. And it’s not just a tweak; we’re talking about a potentially shocking 23% combined tax levy on cryptocurrency gains. Let’s dive deep into what this means for crypto users in Ukraine and the broader implications for digital asset taxation globally. What’s the Latest Buzz Around Crypto Tax Ukraine? According to recent reports from Crypto News, the National Securities and Stock Market Commission (NSSMC) in Ukraine, headed by Ruslan Magomedov, has put forward a proposal that could fundamentally change how cryptocurrencies are taxed in the country. The core of the proposal? An 18% income tax coupled with an additional 5% defense levy on profits derived from cryptocurrency activities. This move is being framed as part of Ukraine’s ongoing efforts to formalize the digital asset sector, especially crucial during the current wartime scenario. But what exactly does this entail, and why is Ukraine taking this step now? Why is Ukraine Proposing Stricter Crypto Regulation and Crypto Income Tax Now? Several factors are likely contributing to Ukraine’s push for enhanced crypto regulation and the introduction of a substantial crypto income tax . Let’s break down the key reasons: Wartime Economic Needs: First and foremost, Ukraine is currently engaged in a conflict that demands significant financial resources. The 5% defense levy is explicitly intended to bolster the nation’s defense capabilities. In times of war, governments often seek to maximize revenue streams, and the burgeoning crypto market presents a relatively untapped area for taxation. Formalizing the Digital Asset Space: Beyond immediate financial needs, there’s a broader global trend towards bringing the crypto market under regulatory frameworks. Governments worldwide are grappling with how to tax and oversee digital assets. Ukraine’s proposal can be seen as aligning with this global movement to formalize the digital asset taxation landscape. Revenue Generation: Even outside of wartime, governments are always looking for ways to increase tax revenue. As cryptocurrency adoption grows, taxing crypto gains becomes an increasingly attractive option. An 18% income tax on crypto profits could represent a significant new revenue stream for the Ukrainian government. Transparency and Control: Regulation brings transparency. By implementing a clear tax framework, Ukraine aims to gain better visibility and control over cryptocurrency transactions within its borders. This can help in combating illicit activities and ensuring fair financial practices. Decoding the Proposed 18% Crypto Income Tax and 5% Defense Levy Let’s break down the numbers and understand what this 23% combined levy could mean in practical terms. Tax Component Percentage Purpose Income Tax 18% General government revenue Defense Levy 5% Funding national defense efforts during wartime Total Crypto Tax 23% Combined tax on cryptocurrency gains Imagine a Ukrainian crypto investor who makes a profit of $10,000 from trading Bitcoin or Ethereum. Under this proposal, they would be liable to pay $1,800 as income tax and an additional $500 as a defense levy, totaling $2,300 in taxes. This is a substantial amount and could significantly impact the profitability of crypto investments in Ukraine. What are the Potential Benefits and Challenges of Ukraine’s Defense Levy Crypto Tax? Like any significant policy change, Ukraine’s proposed crypto tax framework comes with its own set of potential benefits and challenges. Potential Benefits: Increased Government Revenue: The most immediate benefit is a potential boost to government coffers. The combined 23% tax could generate significant funds, particularly the 5% defense levy crypto tax, which is directly aimed at supporting national defense during a critical time. Formalization of Crypto Market: Clear tax rules can bring legitimacy and structure to the Ukrainian crypto market. This could attract more traditional investors and businesses who prefer operating within a regulated environment. International Alignment: By implementing crypto taxes, Ukraine aligns itself with global trends in digital asset regulation, potentially improving its standing with international financial bodies and partners. Potential Challenges: Impact on Crypto Adoption: A high tax rate could deter crypto adoption in Ukraine. Investors might be less inclined to engage with cryptocurrencies if a significant portion of their profits is taxed. This could stifle innovation and growth in the domestic crypto sector. Enforcement Difficulties: Taxing crypto is inherently complex. Tracking transactions across decentralized networks and ensuring compliance can be challenging, even with the best regulatory framework. Effective enforcement will be crucial for the success of this proposal. Competitive Disadvantage: If neighboring countries or other crypto-friendly nations have lower or no crypto taxes, Ukraine could become less attractive for crypto businesses and investors. This could lead to capital flight and hinder the growth of Ukraine’s digital economy. Complexity and Compliance Burden: Navigating a new tax system, especially one involving digital assets, can be complex for individuals and businesses. Clear guidelines, educational resources, and streamlined compliance processes will be essential to minimize the burden on taxpayers. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for Crypto Users? If you are a crypto user in Ukraine or are considering investing in the Ukrainian crypto market, here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on the developments surrounding this proposal. Regulations can evolve, and the final implementation might differ from the initial proposal. Follow reputable crypto news sources and official government announcements. Seek Professional Advice: Consult with tax advisors who specialize in cryptocurrency taxation. Understanding your tax obligations under the new framework is crucial for compliance and financial planning. Plan Your Investments Strategically: Factor in the 23% tax when evaluating the potential profitability of your crypto investments in Ukraine. Consider how this tax rate might impact your overall investment strategy. Advocate for Fair Regulations: Engage with crypto advocacy groups and participate in discussions about crypto regulation in Ukraine. Your voice can contribute to shaping a balanced and effective regulatory framework. Conclusion: Navigating the New Crypto Tax Landscape in Ukraine Ukraine’s proposal to impose an 18% income tax and a 5% defense levy on cryptocurrency gains marks a significant moment in the country’s approach to digital asset taxation . While the move aims to boost government revenue and formalize the crypto sector, it also presents potential challenges for crypto adoption and competitiveness. The coming months will be crucial in observing how this proposal evolves and how effectively it is implemented. For crypto users and stakeholders, staying informed, seeking expert advice, and strategic planning will be paramount to navigating this new tax landscape in Ukraine. The global crypto community will be watching closely to see how this unfolds and what precedents it might set for other nations grappling with similar challenges.

This downturn aligns with the broader market’s struggles, where major cryptocurrencies are also facing declines due to ongoing tensions in the US-China trade war. Yesterday, Ripple made headlines by acquiring a prime broker, a move viewed positively for the project. However, short-term price movements for XRP are still heavily influenced by Bitcoin’s performance, and, by extension, the stock market. Despite a slight bounce toward the end of the stock market session, the broader market was bearish, which had a direct impact on XRP’s price action. XRP’s Struggles with Key Levels XRP failed to reclaim the crucial $1.95 to $2 level, which remains a significant resistance zone. While it’s possible that XRP may eventually push past this level, it largely depends on Bitcoin’s performance, as XRP’s correlation with BTC remains strong at 85%. After yesterday’s rejection from $1.95, XRP dropped to a local support level around $1.75, where it has managed to hold steady, showing some volume support at this price point. Short-Term Retracement and Support Levels In the short term, XRP is retracing and approaching a key support level between $1.74 and $1.75. While it’s possible to see a bounce from this support zone, the overall trend remains bearish as lower highs and lower lows continue to form within a descending parallel channel. Over the past 24 hours, XRP faced rejection at a previous support level now acting as resistance. This shift from support to resistance is a clear bearish indicator, reinforcing the overall downward trend in price. Downside Price Targets for XRP The key downside targets for XRP include the $1.60 range and the $1.74-$1.75 support zone. Traders should watch these levels closely as potential points for further price action or reversals.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-09 12:12:57

For example, both Dan Gambardello and Shib Knight have made bold price predictions for these top crypto coins. Meanwhile, all eyes turn to a presale star, which offers guaranteed 361% returns. IntelMarkets (INTL) is a phase ten presale star that will soon get listed on a Tier-1 crypto exchange like Uniswap. Traders are also excited for INTL as it will be connected to the thriving AI market - giving it incredible long-term growth potential and stability. IntelMarkets (INTL) Set To Surge by 361% Soon While the ADA price and the Shiba Inu price have seen some volatility recently, IntelMarkets (INTL) is also turning some heads. This presale star is in its tenth phase, but early buyers are already 911% richer. However, another 361% surge will come soon since a top-tier exchange listing is approaching. At its core, the Intell-M algorithms will power the IntelMarkets platform. The hype for this upcoming project was already high, as it will be the first AI-driven trade platform. On it, traders will experience the Intelli-M analysis tool, which provides consolidated insights from over 10K data platforms. Plus, AI models will detect any market anomalies before they make headlines. As a result, traders will get to make the best decision. By holding the INTL crypto coin, users will get the first dibs on new IntelMarkets features and voting rights for governance. Demand is high, with over 18M INTL tokens sold in phase ten of its presale alone. Currently, INTL is worth $0.091, but this altcoin price will soar to $0.42 after a Tier-1 CEX lists it. This 361% growth makes INTL one of the best crypto coins for big gains this cycle. Dan Gambardello: The ADA Price Looks Primed for a New ATH Cardano (ADA) is one of the top crypto coins, but it has faced some turbulence recently. CoinMarketCap shows that the ADA price dipped from around $0.80 to nearly $0.50 in the past 30 days alone. In other words, over a 30% fall in just a few short weeks for this crypto coin. However, market expert Dan Gambardello remains bullish for Cardano (ADA). In a recent X post, Dan said this crypto coin is priming itself for a new ATH and maybe even beyond. This could mean a potential ADA price pump past $3.10. Despite this bullish Cardano price prediction, many traders are skeptical. Since it has a high market cap of around $20B, much new money must come in for the ADA price to skyrocket. But, crypto coins like INTL will not have to deal with this problem. Analyst Claims the Shiba Inu Price May See Big Gains Although one of the best meme coins, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has also shown some volatility. Its value dropped over 15% in the past seven days, as per CoinMarketCap. During that time, the Shiba Inu price fell from around $0.000012 to nearly $0.000010. However, traders are excited about this token thanks to a bullish Shiba Inu price prediction by prominent expert Shib Knight. According to his X post, this meme coin shows an accumulation in the falling wedge pattern on its one-month chart. Once it breaks out, he foresees the Shiba Inu price soaring to $0.000087. However, many investors are still choosing INTL over SHIB. Since this meme coin is mostly hype-based, it is filled with uncertainty. Meanwhile, INTL will have utility, which will increase its adoption. Therefore, the Shiba Inu price may rise slower than this presale gem. Can IntelMarkets (INTL) Surge Quicker Than Cardano (ADA) and Shiba Inu (SHIB)? While the ADA price and the Shiba Inu price could regain bullish momentum soon, IntelMarkets (INTL) may leave them in the dust. This project will connect to the AI market, which Statista predicts could be worth $826B by 2030. Thanks to its groundbreaking technology, IntelMarkets is in the perfect spot to capitalize on this growth and make millions. This will give the INTL crypto coin more stability and long-term growth potential. Plus, this crypto coin will see faster price growth than ADA and SHIB since it will have a smaller market cap. As a result, traders rush to buy INTL before its value rises by 361% soon.

43121672,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/04/launching-now-new-crypto-presale-set-for-record-breaking-raise,1744200939,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/43121672.jpeg,Launching Now: New Crypto Presale Set for Record Breaking Raise,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/04/launching-now-new-crypto-presale-set-for-record-breaking-raise,"CartelFi , the innovative new memecoin yield protocol, officially launched its highly anticipated presale today, with early indicators suggesting it could achieve record-breaking funding levels. This new crypto presale introduces a first-of-its-kind platform bridging the $90 billion DeFi ecosystem with a memecoin market on track for a $1 trillion valuation at cycle top. With high volumes of buys expected within minutes of launching, this new crypto presale is generating major momentum across crypto. CartelFi has got the community hooked by solving crypto's most frustrating dilemma: how to generate yield from idle memecoins without sacrificing their explosive upside potential. The CARTFI token presale is now live with tokens initially priced at $0.0251, implementing a structured 90-day format divided into 30 three-day stages that run until 7th July. When the presale ends, CARTFI will immediately list on exchanges, and thanks to 5% price increases between stages, early buyers could see 300% gains by then. The memecoin revolution begins bow Today's launch represents a turning point for the memecoin sector, with CartelFi introducing specialized liquidity mechanisms designed specifically for these formerly unproductive assets. The vast majority of meme token value—tens of billions of dollars—currently sits idle in wallets, generating zero returns while holders await market pumps. Until now, if you wanted yield, you’d need to sell your moonshots for stablecoins, and put them to work in liquidity pools. Not anymore, though, thanks to CartelFi. The protocol activates this idle capital through purpose-built liquidity and staking pools, enabling memecoin holders to earn serious yields without selling their assets. This approach distinguishes this new crypto presale from conventional DeFi platforms, which typically ignore or marginalize the memecoin sector despite its massive capitalization. Early buyers participating in today's launch gain exposure to an untapped market segment with significant growth potential—and the investment pouring in already indicates that the market believes CARTFI is undervalued at current ICO prices of just $0.0276. CartelFi’s deflationary feedback loop CartelFi also debuts a clever tokenomics “hack” that could compound CARTFI price appreciation, underscoring its status as one of the best new crypto presales. Unlike most yield farming tokens—think UNI and CRV—that suffer from supply inflation, CartelFi implements aggressive deflationary mechanics creating continual upward pressure on token value. The protocol allocates up to 100% of generated platform fees toward automatic token buybacks, with 50% of purchased tokens permanently removed from circulation, constricting supply. The planning here is really quite clever: as platform adoption increases, more fees generate more buybacks, reducing available supply and potentially driving appreciation for remaining tokens even higher. This “deflationary DeFi” approach makes CartelFi one of the top new crypto presale opportunities around—it’s striving for genuine innovation, and packs sustainable tokenomics designed to protect and enhance value across all market conditions. CARTFI: The best new crypto presale? Today's newly launched presale introduces a tiered pricing mechanism—beginning at $0.0251 and increasing by 5% every three days—that makes CartelFi a top contender for the best new crypto presale. The presale's first stage has already attracted major investment within hours of launching, with early indicators suggesting potentially record-breaking interest in the coming days. Early stage buyers are positioning themselves for potential significant gains when CARTFI joins actively traded tokens in July, so don’t be surprised if inflows continue to be heavy over the next 72 hours. CartelFi's development team reports that work is already well advanced on both single-asset staking pools and specialized liquidity provision systems, with the core protocol infrastructure on track for its scheduled Q3 launch following today's presale. A truly ambitious project, CartelFi is one of today’s most distinctive DeFi innovations—but can the team really pull it off? And will CARTFI live up to the expectations of the hoarders of early investors piling in right now? So far, there’s a huge bet on “yes”. Learn more about CartelFi on the official website .

Smart Investors Prefer AI Altcoins Like IntelMarkets and Bittensor Instead of Memes,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/04/solana-ready-to-jump-back-to-200-smart-investors-prefer-ai-altcoins-like-intelmarkets-and-bittensor-instead-of-memes,"As the Solana price battles to break past key resistance zones and shake off its latest correction, savvy investors are already shifting their focus. Instead of clinging to shaky meme coin hype or waiting endlessly on SOL's rebound, they’re chasing the explosive potential of AI-powered altcoins like IntelMarkets (INTL) and Bittensor (TAO). INTL , in particular, is making headlines with its AI-fueled trading platform and a red-hot presale that has already raised over $12.2M, making it a standout opportunity in the crypto market’s next evolution. Let’s find out more about SOL, TAO, and INTL. Solana Price Struggles: But Is SOL Reversal on the Horizon? Since mid-March, the Solana price has been stable at around $120. However, SOL eventually broke down, depreciating by 23%. Although there are now no bullish indications for SOL, the Solana price entered the oversold zone with some hint that a reversal may occur soon. The 4-hour chart shows SOL completing a five-wave impulse to $294, followed by a WXYXZ correction within a descending channel. After a brief breakout to $180, resistance forced a reversal, sending the Solana price down to key support around $118. A short-lived recovery hit $148 before another dip pushed SOL to $109.89, forming an ABC corrective wave. With RSI now deep in oversold territory at 22.50%, a Solana price trend reversal could be on the horizon. Despite the downbeat view, if the Solana price rises sharply and moves over the $120 level, a positive SOL reversal will be around the corner. Double Bottom Pattern Emerges: Is Bittensor Ready to Explode? Altcoins like Bittensor (TAO) are attracting more attention from investors as the larger cryptocurrency market begins to rebound. Following a difficult time, TAO is now showing encouraging indicators that might indicate a significant improvement in the weeks ahead. A strong double-bottom pattern, a classic technical formation linked to trend reversals, can be seen on TAO's weekly chart. Early in December 2024, after an unsuccessful effort to breach the $743 barrier level, Bittensor started to drop. TAO has now seen a dramatic 70% correction, ultimately breaching major support levels. Analysts are now keeping a close eye out for indications of a bullish turnaround when the pattern's second bottom occurs. At the time of writing, TAO is trading at about $190. Despite a 6.3% decline in the last week, the overall picture is still positive, as Bittensor has climbed 4.06% in the last 24 hours. A potential rally that can push TAO back to its previous highs has been suggested by market analysts, taking into consideration Bittensor’s technical developments. IntelMarkets: The Future of Trading Powered by AI Is Here As Bittensor inches closer to a bullish trend reversal, market experts have noted an increased capital flow to AI crypto coins. One of the projects that is leading the market is IntelMarkets (INTL) , an upcoming AI-powered trading platform offering features never seen before. IntelMarkets (INTL) is bringing the crypto world its first smart-gen trading platform, which is introducing innovative features to everyday traders.

Furthermore, its multichannel analysis will analyze data from multiple markets, giving users a chance to maximize opportunities not limited to one asset class only.

As the platform draws closer to its listing on major CEXs, its launch price is set to be $0.42, a massive 400% ROI for its new investors.

A new survey from ZA Bank shows that nearly 70% of crypto investors in Hong Kong prefer using digital banks to trade crypto. ZA Bank said in a press release shared with crypto.news that the top reasons for choosing digital banks are the ability to trade directly with bank deposits and the ease of using just one account. The bank says the results show a change in how people in Hong Kong approach crypto trading. “As investor interest in virtual assets continues to grow, cryptocurrencies are increasingly viewed as an emerging component of diversified portfolios. Looking ahead, we will continue to expand our one-stop digital investment platform, covering a broad range of asset classes, including crypto, funds, and stocks.” ZA Bank’s CEO Calvin Ng You might also like: Crypto-friendly ZA Bank considers opening physical branches in Hong Kong: report ZA Bank said the trend shows how digital banks are becoming a new way for many investors to enter the crypto market.

Many investors also want more features as more than 81% want support for crypto-in-crypto-out transactions “to enhance asset flexibility,” the report said. Waiting regulatory clarity In late March, a survey by the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology found that a quarter of Hongkongers plan to hold cryptocurrencies, up 6% from a poll conducted in September 2023. Despite the FTX collapse in November 2022, many respondents still expressed confidence in using regulated exchanges. The survey found that Hongkongers are significantly more willing to use crypto exchanges if they are regulated, with 20% more respondents saying they would feel safe depositing money into regulated platforms than unregulated ones.

We will explore these topics further in the following lines . Grayscale shows further support for Cardano Earlier this year, the leading digital asset manager , Grayscale, added Cardano (ADA) to its Smart Contract Fund. The investment vehicle provides accredited investors indirect exposure to a diversified portfolio of cryptocurrencies associated with smart contract platforms. The entity recently rebalanced the fund, solidifying Cardano as its third-largest holding at 22.91%. Ether (ETH) and Solana (SOL) are at the first two spots, with a respective share of 30.92% and 29.05%. On the other hand, Cardano is ahead of Avalanche (AVAX), Sui (SUI), and Polkadot (DOT), whose combined weight is around 17%. Partnership with Ripple on the way? Ripple’s post on X, uploaded at the start of the week, stirred excitement among the community that a collaboration with Cardano might be incoming. The speculation comes from the fact that the video starts with a brief representation of Cardano’s logo , while later, the topic moves to tokenization and its possible progress in the following years. This isn’t the first time rumors of a deal between the two have surfaced. Not long ago, Cardano’s founder, Charles Hoskinson, suggested that the entity might incorporate Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD, into its ecosystem. Prior to that, he and Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse shared positive remarks about each other. Meanwhile, Hoskinson recently hinted about an upcoming collaboration between Cardano and Bitcoin, teasing a demo integration that could take place next month. ADA price outlook As mentioned above, the price of Cardano’s native cryptocurrency has witnessed a solid retreat lately. Currently, it trades at approximately $0.56 (per CoinGecko’s data), representing a 16% weekly decline. ADA Price, Source: CoinGecko The X user Bitcoin Wukong recently claimed that despite the bearish environment, $0.58 and $0.45 remain “strong support levels on a larger timeframe.” “I’ll be buying and holding at these levels—patience is key. Let’s see how it plays out,” they added. ETF approval odds head south An important development that could act as a price catalyst for the asset is the approval of a spot ADA exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the USA. Earlier this year, Grayscale filed with the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to launch such a product. The fund will allow investors to gain direct exposure to ADA without the complexities of owning and managing the cryptocurrency themselves. Of course, it must first receive the necessary green light from the relevant regulators. Last month, the approval odds before the end of 2025 spiked to 70%. In the past few weeks , though , the optimism started to vaporize, and as of now, the chances stand at around 52% (according to Polymarket).

43121794,https://square.htx.com/?p=43679,1744201200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/100/default.png,From Gold to Crypto: The Rise of Tokenized Gold and RWA Assets Amid Market Uncertainty,https://square.htx.com/from-gold-to-crypto/,"Singapore, 9 April – As a leading global digital asset trading platform, HTX provides a secure and efficient trading environment, notably through its XAUT/USDT trading pair. In light of recent market volatility, HTX emphasizes its role in supporting investors seeking stable assets within the Real-World Assets (RWA) sector. The platform offers diverse financial instruments, enabling wider participation in crypto gold investments, designed to mitigate risks during periods of market uncertainty. The cryptocurrency market has recently experienced significant turbulence, with total market capitalization falling below $2.7 trillion and a 7% single-day decline on April 7, driven by U.S. policy-induced volatility. In times of heightened market uncertainty, gold traditionally serves as a recognized safe haven. With the closing price of gold stood at $3,037 per ounce, gold-backed crypto assets have similarly demonstrated resilience. Assets such as XAUT (Tether Gold), representing “crypto gold”, available on HTX, are increasingly favored by investors seeking portfolio diversification and stability. Macroeconomic Pressures Drive Demand for Gold and Tokenized Alternatives Recent U.S. policy announcements, including the imposition of a 10% “minimum benchmark tariff” on global imports and retaliatory tariffs, precipitated substantial market instability. The U.S. Nasdaq index experienced a 12% market capitalization contraction within two days, marking a significant global decline. . This turbulence has extended to the crypto market, causing substantial declines in major assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. In this context, gold and tokenized gold assets, particularly XAUT, have showcased stability, reinforcing their status as secure investment tools. XAUT’s blockchain-enabled infrastructure provides immediate gold delivery and global access, streamlining investment compared to traditional gold futures. Increased strategic reserve demand, with global central banks accumulating over 1,000 tons of gold in three consecutive years, and institutional interest in tokenized gold for U.S. dollar credit risk mitigation, further bolster the appeal of assets like XAUT. Its transparent 1:1 physical gold backing and on-chain traceability make it a strategic asset for sovereign wealth funds and multinational corporations. XAUT Demonstrates Resilience Amidst Market Uncertainty XAUT, a gold-backed token issued by Tether, is pegged to 1 troy ounce of London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) accredited physical gold and fully backed by Tether’s gold reserves. As traditional gold prices rise, XAUT demonstrates parallel performance. According to CoinMarketCap data , when the overall crypto market plunged on April 7, XAUT fell by just 0.08%. Image from HTX’s data on April 7 HTX provides access to the superior liquidity and 24/7 trading of crypto gold assets, along with their seamless integration into the DeFi ecosystem. Fractional ownership and instant transaction settlement, available through HTX, address the challenges of traditional gold investments.

By 2026, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is poised to launch a groundbreaking “gateway” authorization regime, dramatically broadening its supervision of the crypto sector. If you’re involved in crypto in the UK, or watching from afar, this is a pivotal development you need to understand. Let’s dive into what this transformative change means for the future of digital assets in the United Kingdom. Decoding the Current Landscape of UK Crypto Regulations Currently, the FCA’s crypto oversight primarily zeroes in on anti-money laundering (AML) compliance. While crucial, this is just one piece of the puzzle. Think of it like regulating traffic flow only at intersections, ignoring the highways in between. The existing UK crypto regulations framework, while a starting point, doesn’t encompass the full spectrum of crypto activities. This limited scope has left many areas of the crypto market operating in a regulatory grey zone. Here’s a snapshot of the current situation: Focus on AML: The FCA’s main focus has been ensuring crypto firms comply with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing rules. Limited Scope: Many crypto activities, such as stablecoin issuance, lending platforms, and exchange operations, fall outside the current AML-centric regulations. Industry Calls for Clarity: The crypto industry itself has been advocating for clearer and more comprehensive regulations to foster growth and innovation while protecting consumers. This evolving landscape is precisely why the new gateway regime is such a significant leap forward. It’s about creating a more robust and encompassing regulatory framework for the burgeoning crypto industry in the UK. What is the New UK Crypto Gateway Regime and Why is it a Game Changer? Imagine a comprehensive entry point – a “gateway” – that all crypto firms must pass through to operate legally in the UK. That’s essentially what the FCA’s new authorization regime aims to establish. This UK crypto gateway regime is designed to be far more extensive than the current AML-focused approach. It’s about creating a holistic regulatory environment that covers a much wider array of crypto activities. Key Aspects of the Gateway Regime: Broader Scope: Moving beyond AML, the regime will encompass activities like: Stablecoin issuance Payment services involving crypto Crypto lending and borrowing platforms Operation of crypto exchanges Authorization Requirement: Crypto firms engaging in these regulated activities will need to seek authorization from the FCA to operate in the UK market. Consumer Protection: A core objective is to enhance consumer protection by ensuring crypto firms meet certain standards and operate within a regulated framework. Market Integrity: The regime aims to bolster market integrity and reduce the risks associated with unregulated crypto activities. This isn’t just about tighter rules; it’s about fostering a more mature and sustainable crypto ecosystem in the UK. By bringing more activities under its regulatory umbrella, the FCA aims to create a level playing field and build trust in the digital asset space. How Will FCA Crypto Oversight Expand Under the New Rules? The expansion of FCA crypto oversight is the heart of this regulatory overhaul. Currently, the FCA’s reach is limited. The new gateway regime signals a significant broadening of its powers and responsibilities in the crypto domain. Think of the FCA moving from a specialist regulator in a niche area to a primary supervisor for a substantial segment of the financial services industry. Areas of Expanded FCA Oversight: Activity Current Regulation (Pre-Gateway) Regulation Under Gateway Regime Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Regulated Regulated (Continued Focus) Stablecoin Issuance Largely Unregulated Regulated Crypto Payment Services Partially Regulated (depending on structure) Regulated Crypto Lending & Borrowing Largely Unregulated Regulated Crypto Exchanges (spot and derivatives) Partially Regulated (AML focus) Regulated (Comprehensive) This table illustrates the dramatic shift. The FCA’s remit is expanding to encompass core crypto business models that have, until now, operated with limited regulatory scrutiny in the UK. This increased oversight is expected to bring both challenges and opportunities for crypto businesses. Why 2026 for Crypto Regulation 2026: What’s the Timeline and Implications? The year crypto regulation 2026 is now a key date on the crypto industry’s calendar in the UK. Why 2026? Implementing such a comprehensive regime takes time. It’s not just about flipping a switch; it requires careful planning, consultation, and the development of robust operational frameworks. The timeline suggests a phased approach, allowing both regulators and the industry to prepare for this significant transition. Timeline and Implications: Preparation Time: The 2026 timeframe allows the FCA to develop the necessary infrastructure, guidance, and processes for the new regime. Industry Adaptation: Crypto firms will have time to understand the new requirements, adapt their business models, and prepare their authorization applications. Consultation and Feedback: The FCA is likely to engage in further consultation with the industry as it develops the specifics of the gateway regime. Global Alignment: This timeline potentially aligns with broader global trends in crypto regulation, allowing the UK to position itself as a forward-thinking jurisdiction. For crypto businesses, this timeline is crucial. It’s a call to action to start preparing now. Understanding the likely direction of travel and engaging with the FCA’s consultations will be vital for ensuring a smooth transition and continued operation in the UK market. The Future of UK Digital Asset Regulation: A Balanced Approach? Looking ahead, the expansion of crypto regulations signals a maturing phase for the UK digital asset regulation landscape. The gateway regime suggests a move towards a more balanced approach – one that seeks to foster innovation and growth in the crypto sector while simultaneously mitigating risks and protecting consumers. It’s about finding the sweet spot where regulation enables, rather than stifles, the potential of digital assets. Potential Benefits and Challenges: Benefits: Increased Investor Confidence: Enhanced regulation can boost investor confidence in the crypto market, potentially attracting more institutional and retail participation. Level Playing Field: A comprehensive regime can create a fairer and more transparent market environment for all participants. Innovation and Growth: Clear rules can provide a stable foundation for innovation and long-term growth in the UK crypto sector. Consumer Protection: Stronger regulations will offer better protection for consumers engaging with crypto products and services. Challenges: Compliance Costs: Crypto firms will face increased compliance costs to meet the new regulatory requirements. Potential for Over-Regulation: There’s always a risk that regulations could become overly burdensome and stifle innovation. Adaptation and Implementation: Both regulators and firms will need to navigate the complexities of implementing the new regime effectively. The success of the UK’s expanded crypto regulations will hinge on striking the right balance. A well-designed gateway regime has the potential to position the UK as a leading global hub for digital assets, attracting investment and fostering innovation while ensuring a safe and responsible market. Conclusion: Embracing the Evolving Crypto Landscape The FCA’s move to introduce a comprehensive gateway regime by 2026 marks a pivotal moment for the UK crypto industry. It signals a clear intent to move beyond a limited AML focus towards a more holistic and robust regulatory framework. For crypto businesses operating in or targeting the UK market, preparation is key. Understanding the evolving UK crypto regulations , engaging with the FCA, and adapting business models will be crucial for navigating this transformative period. The future of crypto in the UK is being shaped now, and the gateway regime is set to be a landmark development in this exciting journey.

The platform has topped charts through a constant surge in its ongoing presale frenzy with high-volume transactions. Meanwhile, the XRP price is showing a notable reversal after a 20% rebound in the network. Are Ripple investors back in the market? Ripple to Add a $1.25 Billion Company to Its Acquisition Ripple (XRP) just made a power move that could shake up the entire crypto market. Ripple is snapping up prime brokerage firm ‘Hidden Road’ in a $1.25 billion deal. And that’s not just big, it’s huge. With this acquisition, Ripple has become the first crypto network to fully own and run a global, multi-asset prime broker, with more recovery opportunities underway for the XRP price. That’s a major leap toward blending traditional finance with the fast-evolving digital ecosystem. That said, ‘Hidden Road’ is not an ordinary name. The firm’s been climbing the ranks fast, giving institutional clients access to everything from foreign exchange and crypto to swaps and fixed income, all under one roof. Analysts say this partnership could take the XRP price to new highs. Right now, it processes a whopping $3 trillion every year and works with more than 300 of the world’s top financial institutions. This acquisition has taken place at an ideal moment when the XRP price is recovering. As the U.S. crypto regulatory environment starts to clear up, Ripple sees a fresh window for serious institutional growth. Here’s What We Know About ‘Hidden Road’ Backed by Ripple’s deep balance sheet and regulatory background, with over 60 licenses globally, Hidden Road will now have the platform to expand aggressively, take on more markets, and handle bigger client demands. This deal also puts Ripple’s upcoming stablecoin (RLUSD) into the spotlight and opens grounds for the XRP price as it shows recovery. Hidden Road plans to use it as collateral for trading products, which makes it the first USD-backed stablecoin to support cross-margining between crypto and traditional finance. Moreover, Hidden Road’s post-trade operations will drive more investors to drive the XRP price upward. That shift could cut costs and make the backend more efficient.

But as the dust settles, inflows have slowed, raising questions about XRP’s next move . February Frenzy: XRP’s $30B Inflow Explained The XRP Realised Cap by Age chart shows that in February, the Realised Cap sharply jumped from $30.1 billion to $64.2 billion. This indicates that nearly $30 billion flowed into the XRP market in a short period. Source : glassnode In February, the XRP market showed a sideways trend. At the start of the month, the price of XRP was $3.0320. By the end of that month, it dropped to 2.144, marking a decline of 29.3%. Retail Investors Led the Charge – But Where Are They Now? According to the XRP Realised Cap by Age chart, at least $30 billion flowed into the market in February. This kind of sudden inflow usually shows strong excitement or hype around the asset. It is clear that short-term investors played a crucial role in XRP’s February momentum. Currently, the XRP market is showing bearish signals. This month alone, the market has dropped over 13.3%. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple vs SEC Update: Legal Contradictions Raise New Questions About XRP Lawsuit’s Status , Signs of Colling: What Slower Inflows Mean for XRP Data suggests that after February, the inflows into XRP slowed down. This means that the momentum has cooled and those investors are not buying as actively now. The XRP market experienced a change of +46% in January, -29.3% in February and -2.52% in March. At the beginning of this month, the price of XRP was at $2.0943. Since then, the market has slipped by over 13.3%. Between April 6 and 8 alone, the market decreased by no fewer than 16.21%. In conclusion, the dramatic inflow of $30 billion into Ripple in February highlights how quickly retail excitement can flood into crypto markets. However, the recent slowdown in inflows and sustained price declines suggest that much of this momentum was short-lived. XRP’s near-term direction now hinges on whether fresh buying interest returns – or of the market will continue to bleed out as enthusiasm fades. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Not At This Price,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4773964-is-janover-next-strategy-not-at-this-price?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"Summary Janover's stock surged from $4 to $48 following a shift to a crypto-focused business model, but has since pulled back to ~$27. The company plans to transition from a small software provider to a digital asset treasury company, focusing on Solana instead of Bitcoin. Janover raised $42 million through convertible notes to acquire Solana, but the stock's current valuation is overly optimistic given the inherent risks. I rate it a Strong Sell as the stock's valuation implies excessive optimism, requiring Solana to generate significant additional value to justify current prices. Earlier this week, micro-cap software company Janover ( JNVR ) made waves by announcing a majority stake by a crypto-focused management team that intends to completely shift the company’s business model. The stock closed at $4 the day before the announcement, and then hit a high of $48 before pulling back. Shares are trading at ~$27 as of this writing, so it’s a long way off its highs. This kind of volatility is difficult to trade given the rapid movements, but if we step back and look at the plan, it is my view we’ll see prices a lot lower than $27 in the weeks and months to come. Let’s dig in. What is Janover? Janover today is an AI-powered online platform that connects commercial real estate participants to valuable data through a SaaS model. Janover claims to have over 1 million web users annually, which include multifamily and commercial property owners and developers. In addition, it says more than 10% of the financial institutions in America use its platform. Investor presentation Here’s a basic look at how the company achieves this. It is a data platform for commercial real estate, essentially, touting its use of AI as a way to enhance the value it’s providing to users. That all sounds nice, but in practice, this business is tiny . Seeking Alpha Revenue has been around $2 million annually for a few years, so we’re talking about what would qualify as a small business in the US by any measure. Janover is building its annual recurring revenue through a subscription model, rather than transactional, and that is working. Investor presentation The company’s losses are narrowing, but again, we’re talking about a fledgling software business with a tiny revenue base that hasn’t grown for years. Enter the announcement from earlier this week, and the stock chart looks like this. StockCharts The move earlier this week has already been retraced by almost half, so it appears the market is coming to its senses at least a bit. Even after the stock moved ~8X time into Tuesday’s close, it’s still only a $47 million market cap. This thing is extremely small and investors should understand the risks inherent in trading a stock this small. Big gains are certainly possible, but so are big losses. It simply doesn’t take much money moving in or out to move this stock in a big way, so if you’re interested, just keep that in mind. What happened? In short, Janover is changing its business model from one of a tiny software provider to that of a digital asset treasury company. If this sounds familiar, it’s because it is; Strategy ( MSTR ) was the first mover in this space. It also went from a struggling software business to a digital asset treasury company (Bitcoin, of course), and has seen its share price explode higher in the years since. We could argue the merits of such a move, but the returns are undeniable for Strategy shareholders. It would appear Janover is attempting to do exactly the same thing, except it is focusing on Solana (SOL-USD) rather than Bitcoin. Management states it can earn yield from staking its Solana, but also that Solana is much more volatile than Bitcoin. Management believes this volatility is a source of potential valuation premium for the stock, which I find slightly curious. Generally, investors pay a premium for quality, not volatility. Solana is indeed extremely volatile, which could lead to amplified returns, but also amplified losses. More on that in a bit. Janover is going to continue to operate its software business, but like Strategy, if the company issues a bunch and/or equity to buy Solana, the core business will be meaningless and nobody will care. That’s what happened with Strategy as the Bitcoin holding business is orders of magnitude larger than the software business. That appears to be the playbook here. Investor presentation This playbook is almost exactly what Strategy has been doing for years, and Janover is attempting to capture the premium the market has assigned to Strategy over and above its actual Bitcoin holdings, which is significant. The difference is that Janover is using Solana rather than Bitcoin. Now, as part of the takeover, Janover is going to rename itself to DeFi Development Corporation, and change its ticker at some point in the future. These moves also highlight the idea that the software business Janover currently operates is about to become completely irrelevant, and that the stock is likely to trade with Solana rather than any fundamentals. I wouldn't bother with analyzing the software business any longer. The company has raised $42 million in an offering of convertible notes to angel investors and private equity. The notes accrue interest at 2.5% per year, paid quarterly, and mature in April 2030. They can be redeemed early so long as the company’s market cap is at least $100 million on the day prior to the conversion date, which is a ~2.5X move from this morning’s price. The proceeds are being used to acquire digital assets, starting with Solana. What now? That’s the question, as investors are attempting to revalue this company based upon a complete 180 in terms of its business model. At this point, we can ignore the software business, in my view, as a money-losing business with $2 million of annual revenue simply doesn’t matter in the context of the company holding tens of millions of dollars of cryptocurrency. So let’s instead focus on Solana as a longer-term holding. StockCharts Solana has indeed produced some truly eye-popping returns. The bull run that began in late-2023 produced a move from the low-$20s to almost $300. However, that move has also mostly been given up at this point, with Solana at just over $100 at the time of writing. That’s still up huge from the 2023 lows, but enormously painful if you held at $294 and never sold. That is the obvious risk here with Janover/DevFi; there is no guarantee Solana has to go higher over time. This company is leveraging itself enormously to start, and I’m assuming if it follows the Strategy playbook, even more down the road. If it works, we could see enormous returns for shareholders. If it doesn’t, it has a very good chance of going even lower than the $4 it traded for last Friday. The bottom line The strategy that Janover is employing here has worked wonders for Strategy, so I get the logic. Without it, Janover is just a tiny, unprofitable also-ran in the fintech sector. With Solana staking, it could turn into something more. The problem is that even at $27 (or even worse, Tuesday’s close of $33), way too much is being priced in already. If the company manages to acquire $42 million (give or take) of Solana with basically pure leverage, as it has no appreciable cash on hand to fund anything, the volatility of this stock is going to be epic. Management appears to want that , but it’s something to keep in mind. Now, the only way this can work is for Solana to go up a bunch after the purchases are made, because otherwise, you just have a business with $42 million of an asset (Solana), and an offsetting $42 million liability (convertible notes). It’s not quite that simple, but that’s essentially how it works. The only way to create value is to see the value of the asset exceed the value of the liability, over and above the cost of the liability. In this case, the cost is 2.5% a year, plus the potential dilution of when they mature. At $27 per share (or $33), there is simply too much optimism priced in. Prior to the announcement, the stock was worth ~$5.7 million. Today, it’s $47 million. That implies something like $41 million of value created before anything has actually happened. Thus, in order to even justify the current valuation – forgetting about any potential upside – Janover would need its Solana stake to generate ~$41 million of additional value, or roughly double what the company is trying to acquire. No, thanks; I’m at a Strong Sell on this one.",JNVR|SOL-USD,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|SOL|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-04-09 13:28:49

But beneath the chaos, a curious shift is taking shape: Wall Street and crypto circles alike are beginning to ask—could Bitcoin outlast the dollar? Jeff Parks, head of alpha strategies at Bitwise Asset Management, sparked conversation with an unusually candid reflection on April 9, writing on X, “Higher chance Bitcoin survives over the dollar in our lifetime after today.” What once felt like speculation, Parks admitted, now feels like a truth too pressing to ignore. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley echoed the sentiment, pointing out the growing vacuum of trust in traditional currencies. “Gold has its own problems,” he noted , citing the costs and logistics of shipping and storing physical metal. With the U.S. dollar’s global credibility on shaky ground and no stronger fiat alternative in sight, Horsley concluded with a bold prediction: “You wind up buying Bitcoin.” Tariff Shockwaves Shake Markets The policy that sparked this wave of doubt? A sweeping 10% baseline tariff Trump slapped on all imports effective April 5, followed by even tougher reciprocal tariffs beginning April 9 for countries with major trade imbalances with the U.S. The move has been met with criticism across financial circles, not least because it has failed to strengthen the U.S. dollar as many analysts had predicted. Instead, the U.S. Dollar Index has slipped to 102.19, down nearly 6% since the start of the year. Meanwhile, Bitcoin—despite its reputation as a hedge—hasn’t been immune , currently down 18.37% year-to-date and trading around $76,300, per CoinMarketCap data. Calls Grow Louder for Bitcoin Renowned Bitcoin advocate and economist Saifedean Ammous weighed in with a hard-hitting critique, blaming America’s economic imbalance not on trade policy, but on its dependence on printing money. “The real issue is the global addiction to fiat,” Ammous posted. His solution? A return to “hard money”—be it Bitcoin or gold. In a world increasingly skeptical of government-controlled currencies, the idea that Bitcoin might not just survive but thrive is moving from fringe theory to serious debate.

The popular meme coin has experienced massive selling pressure over the last few days, driven by heightened global tensions and ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. On Monday, DOGE set a fresh local low around $0.129, further confirming the downtrend that has been building over the past few weeks. Related Reading: Oversold Altcoins Like Solana Flash Bullish Divergences — Are Relief Bounces Coming? The market sentiment around Dogecoin has quickly shifted from cautious optimism to defensive positioning, as investors react to a risk-off environment affecting both traditional and crypto markets. Adding fuel to the bearish fire, data from Santiment reveals that Dogecoin whales have sold more than 1.32 billion DOGE in the past 48 hours alone — a move that raises questions about broader market confidence. Is this massive selloff part of a strategic rebalancing from large holders, or is it a sign of panic selling amid deepening volatility? What’s certain is that DOGE is entering a critical phase. If buyers fail to step in soon, the path of least resistance could be lower. As whales exit and prices falter, the coming days could define whether Dogecoin stabilizes — or spirals further. Dogecoin Slides Further As Whale Selloff Signals Deepening Bear Trend Dogecoin has now lost more than 70% of its value since December, with no clear signs of a recovery in sight. The meme coin, once a symbol of bullish enthusiasm and retail speculation, is now leading the decline in the altcoin space as market conditions worsen. Growing macroeconomic uncertainty continues to weigh heavily on risk assets, and meme coins like Dogecoin have been the most affected. The pressure isn’t just coming from within the crypto market. Broader financial instability — particularly triggered by escalating global tensions — is accelerating the selloff. U.S. President Donald Trump’s latest round of aggressive tariffs and China’s retaliatory stance have stoked fears of a full-blown trade war. As global markets reel from this uncertainty, investors are pulling back from speculative assets, sending DOGE deeper into bearish territory. Adding to the bleak outlook, top analyst Ali Martinez shared data from Santiment revealing that whales have sold over 1.32 billion Dogecoin in just the past 48 hours. This significant outflow is a clear reflection of the risk-off sentiment dominating the market. According to Martinez, this behavior is likely driven by panic and growing expectations that a prolonged bear market is developing. Until sentiment shifts and macro conditions stabilize, Dogecoin’s path remains precarious. The combination of whale dumping, market-wide fear, and global economic strain may keep DOGE under pressure in the near term. Bulls will need to reclaim key levels quickly to avoid a deeper collapse — but for now, the trend remains firmly bearish. Related Reading: XRP Breaks Out Of Head-And-Shoulders Pattern — Eyes Move Toward $1.30 Bulls Struggle At Key Level As Selling Pressure Persists Dogecoin is trading at $0.14, nearly 75% below its 200-day moving average around $0.25 — a striking indicator of how far the meme coin has fallen. The downtrend accelerated when DOGE lost support at the $0.25 level, and since then, bulls have failed to mount any meaningful recovery. Continued macroeconomic stress and weak investor sentiment have only added to the selling pressure, dragging prices lower with each passing week. For Dogecoin to begin a potential recovery phase, holding above the $0.15 level is critical. This zone could act as a short-term support base, giving bulls a chance to regroup. However, merely stabilizing isn’t enough. A push toward the $0.20 mark is needed to reestablish momentum and break the current bearish structure. Reclaiming that level would also bring DOGE closer to its 200-day MA, a key technical milestone for trend reversal.

If support fails to hold, a quick move toward the $0.10 level is possible — potentially signaling a return to bear market lows. For now, DOGE remains under heavy pressure, with bulls on the defensive and time running out to avoid another breakdown.

As the crypto market continues its downtrend, the affected cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and others, are struggling. As a result, it is building fear among investors. Interestingly, a few experts believe this is nothing new to the BTC’s price journey. More importantly, it is set to reach the $200k mark. How? Let’s discuss this. Crypto Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Price to Hit 200k in 2025 Despite the lingering fearful sentiments among investors, a renowned pseudonymous crypto analyst, Dave the Wave, predicts that the biggest crypto is going to hit $200k within this year. In an X post, he analysed the Bitcoin chart and claimed it would see $200k at the end of the year. A BTC repeat would see 200K at the end of the year. His analysis is based on the BTC price chart that formed the ascending parallel channel and several other indicators. The analyst believes that the token has been in a bullish pattern since 2022, with a top of $200k as the upper boundaries align with that. More importantly, The Bitcoin price chart is mirroring a historical pattern, which resulted in the 172% rally in the previous year. If the action continues, the token’s price could jump from the current value of $77.4k to $201k by November 2025. Additionally, Dave’s chart mentions technical factors such as Fibonacci’s retracement level bouncing from the historically proven key resistance level of $0.382. A move past this often resulted in a strong Bitcoin bull market. However, the odds of a crash remain as Trump’s tariff implementation hints at the crypto market’s further unpredictability. Investors’ Macroeconomic Concerns Impact Bitcoin Price The BTC analysts’ price prediction brought optimism among readers. However, at the same time, few questioned the credibility of the forecast as Trump’s trade war , US recession odds, and various other macroeconomic events are impacting the digital assets. In a blog post, Dave claimed that Bitcoin has been struggling due to investors’ high hopes since it breached $100k. He acknowledged the BTC panic but claimed that he would be bullish as long the token continued to trade above the crucial support of $74k. “That level is $74,000. Wouldn’t want to see the price below that.” Currently, it is at $77.4k, but various Bitcoin price predictions show recovery amid the Fed’s emergency rate cuts and other factors.

The discussions are expected to focus on a package of economic support legislation to improve domestic consumption and stabilize volatile capital markets. The anonymous sources claimed the meeting would bring together senior officials from the State Council, the People’s Bank of China, and other regulatory bodies. On Wednesday, the US took the duties on Chinese imports to 104% , almost double the rate initially set for the Asian country. Tariff hikes are offensive to the Chinese government According to Reuters, the gathering will be the first publicly known high-level response from Chinese policymakers since President Trump announced the US tariff hikes on April 2. Sources say representatives from the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Finance, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), and the National Financial Regulatory Administration (NFRA) are expected to attend the closed-door session. The State Council Information Office and the involved agencies have not responded to media requests for comment. Still, insiders asserted that the focus would be on measures that could be implemented in the short term to support domestic economic activity, with several options on the table, including improved export tax rebates and increased consumer subsidies. Analysts believe China’s leadership is pressured to answer investors and the public’s queries about having the necessities to manage the fallout from Washington’s “war-like” trade policies. Trade war hits China during fragile economic times While fighting US tariffs, China is already grappling with a prolonged property sector downturn and ballooning local government debt, which has sapped business confidence and weakened household spending. Economists warn that the trade conflict could knock as much as two percentage points off China’s GDP growth this year. Sluggish demand for goods, industrial overcapacity, and growing deflationary pressure puts the world’s second-largest economy on unstable footing. Even with the 34% counter-tariffs measured towards the US, as revealed last Friday, Beijing is arguably on the defensive. Trump’s trade strategy is to try isolating China from the global trading system, pushing taxes on Chinese exports, together with countries and firms involved in the assembly or resale of Chinese goods. Premier Li Qiang on Tuesday insisted China is “fully capable of hedging against adverse external influences.” Still, market watchers believe the scale of the challenge will limit what monetary and fiscal policy alone can achieve. Although China ran a trillion-dollar trade surplus last year, this cushion may not be enough to offset collapsing global demand when the tariff dispute pulls down economic tailwinds by the hour. “There is no sector of the economy that could even remotely survive 104% tariffs on China, btw,” propounded one stock market trader on X. At a press conference earlier today, China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Lin Jian, said Chinese people’s “legitimate right to development must not be deprived” through punitive tariffs on Chinese goods. Lin accused the United States of engaging in “bullying practices” and asked the Trump administration to exercise “equality, mutual respect, and reciprocity” in resolving the trade mishap through dialogue. “ If the US insists on provoking a trade war. China will be compelled to fight to the end, ” Lin concluded. Stocks are still in a bloodbath, everywhere Over to financial markets, Chinese blue-chip stocks have erased all gains for the year, with the CSI300 Index plunging over 5% since April 2, the day Trump announced an additional 34% tariff on Chinese goods. The Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong has fared even worse, tumbling 12.5% over the same period. However, hours before Wednesday’s US market opened, Chinese stocks had recovered some ground, following the government’s retaliatory 84% tariff on US goods. The offshore yuan also strengthened to approximately 7.38 against the US dollar, snapping a three-day losing streak supported by a weaker greenback. Talks of officials’ interest in domestic tech companies and state pledges to backstop the markets gave a modest boost to investor sentiment. Chinese state media are expected to report portions of the upcoming meeting’s agenda to reassure markets of policymakers’ unity. According to local news outlets, some measures discussed could be rolled out in the coming weeks, but no definitive timetable has been disclosed. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

As of today, Cardano (ADA) finds itself trading above $0.5, but this price point is hanging on by a thread. The broader market sentiment, driven by the ongoing volatility in major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Dogecoin (DOGE), has left Cardano (ADA) vulnerable to further declines. Meanwhile, a new player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, Coldware (COLD) , has emerged as a promising alternative, showing significant promise in the DePin (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network) ecosystem. With Cardano (ADA) facing difficulties maintaining its price above $0.5, Coldware (COLD) could be poised to take advantage of this uncertainty. Coldware (COLD): A Viable Alternative to Cardano (ADA) Coldware (COLD) is making waves in the DePin ecosystem, offering decentralized physical infrastructure solutions that can transform the way we approach blockchain technology. Unlike Cardano (ADA), which primarily focuses on scalability and smart contract functionalities, Coldware (COLD) aims to solve real-world problems, providing users with an infrastructure that combines blockchain technology with the physical world. With Coldware (COLD) entering the DePin ecosystem, the blockchain project has set itself apart from Cardano (ADA) and other traditional cryptocurrencies by addressing pressing issues in infrastructure and security. Coldware (COLD) offers faster transaction speeds, lower fees, and better scalability compared to Cardano (ADA), which has struggled with high fees and slow transactions. Cardano's (ADA) Struggle to Maintain Price Stability Cardano (ADA), once heralded as an Ethereum challenger, has struggled to maintain its price in recent months. Cardano (ADA)’s price recently dropped by more than 14% over the past week, and its trading volume has also decreased significantly. Currently priced at $0.5677, Cardano (ADA) is fighting to hold onto its support at $0.52. If this level fails to hold, Cardano (ADA) could potentially fall below the $0.50 mark, a psychological barrier that could further erode investor confidence. In addition to the price struggles, Cardano (ADA) is facing mixed technical signals. While there is some bullish interest, the overall trend remains down, and Cardano (ADA) risks continuing its downward trajectory unless the $0.52 support level holds strong. The combination of these factors has caused many investors to start eyeing alternatives to Cardano (ADA), such as Coldware (COLD) , which offers solutions to some of the issues that Cardano (ADA) and other blockchains struggle with. The Future of Cardano (ADA) and Coldware (COLD) in the Market As Cardano (ADA) continues to face uncertainty and its price hangs by a thread, Coldware (COLD) has the potential to step in and offer a more efficient and scalable blockchain solution. While Cardano (ADA) remains entrenched in a battle to maintain its position in the market, Coldware (COLD) is poised to emerge as a serious contender within the DePin ecosystem. Investors looking for the next big thing in blockchain technology are increasingly turning to Coldware (COLD) , which promises real-world applications and utility far beyond what Cardano (ADA) has been able to offer. As Cardano (ADA) faces continued struggles in maintaining its price, Coldware (COLD) is positioning itself as the future leader in decentralized infrastructure. Conclusion: Coldware (COLD) and the DePin Revolution The ongoing struggles of Cardano (ADA) to maintain price stability are opening the door for new competitors like Coldware (COLD) . With its focus on real-world utility, scalability, and decentralized infrastructure, Coldware (COLD) offers a promising alternative to Cardano (ADA) and other established blockchain projects. As the market continues to evolve, Coldware (COLD) is likely to lead the next generation of blockchain technology, providing users and investors with a more secure, efficient, and scalable solution. Cardano (ADA) may still hold its place for now, but with Coldware (COLD) innovative approach, its position in the market could soon be at risk.

Core’s initial contributor, Rich Rines, told Cointelegraph that as of April 7, over 44 million Core tokens have been dual-staked with 3,140 Bitcoin ( BTC ). At the time of writing, the assets are worth about $260 million. Core’s dual-staking model lets Bitcoin holders earn higher yields with CORE tokens. While users can stake BTC at a lower rate, those who stake BTC with Core tokens get an enhanced yield. “Dual Staking can multiply base staking rewards over 15 times, depending on how many CORE tokens are staked,” Core said in a statement. Core’s new milestone highlights growing demand for Bitcoin staking The latest milestone was driven in part by institutional investors integrating Core’s staking model into their platforms. Core Foundation said that major custodians like BitGo, Copper and Hex Trust have enabled their clients to gain access to the protocol by integrating dual staking. Core added that it had partnered with Maple Finance for a structured asset that uses Core’s dual-staking to generate yield. Rines told Cointelegraph that institutions have been crucial catalysts to the early success of its dual staking model. He said the model unlocks new opportunities for institutions. “This shift has broader implications for the Bitcoin ecosystem. Historically, institutional BTC holdings required paying custody fees without generating yield,” Rines told Cointelegraph. He added that by integrating Core’s staking model, institutions can turn Bitcoin into a yield-bearing asset that offsets costs and unlocks new capital efficiencies. At the time of writing, Core holds the biggest total value locked (TVL) among Bitcoin sidechains. Footprint analytics puts Core’s TVL above $400 million, with a market share of 28%. Distribution of chain TVLs among Bitcoin sidechains. Source: Footprint Analytics Related: Bitcoin ETFs lose $326M amid ‘evolving’ dynamic with TradFi markets Bitcoin becoming “productive” The Core team said the increase in the number of dual-staked CORE tokens highlights how the product fulfills its design. Rines told Cointelegraph: “The 44 million+ CORE tokens dual-staked to date show real adoption of the model. It reflects that users, both retail and institutional, are actively looking to put their Bitcoin to work securely and sustainably.” Rines emphasized that Core’s dual-staking system offers a sustainable utility for long-term Bitcoin holders without requiring them to relinquish custody. “This is Bitcoin becoming productive, not by trusting third parties, but by participating in a system designed to reward real alignment and long-term engagement,” Rines said.

While many are under investigation before the SEC, a significant move for DOGE came from digital asset management firm 21Shares. 21Shares has announced the launch of its Dogecoin ETP (DOGE) backed by the DOGE foundation. 21 Shares' Dogecoin ETP will be listed on the Swiss exchange SIX, while its DOGE ETP will be the first and only Dogecoin ETP backed by the Dogecoin Foundation. 21 Shares’ ETP aims to offer regulated institutional access to Dogecoin, a memecoin that was born as a joke in 2013. Duncan Moir, Chairman of 21Shares, said: “With this exclusive partnership with the Dogecoin Foundation, we are providing investors with the most direct and accessible way to gain exposure to the Dogecoin ecosystem. Dogecoin has become more than just a cryptocurrency: it represents a cultural and financial movement that continues to drive mainstream adoption, and DOGE offers investors a regulated way to be a part of this exciting project.” Moir noted that the ETP is 100% physically backed, with each unit backed by actual DOGE assets, and will incur a 2.5% management fee. *This is not investment advice.

The company has remained bullish on the top crypto for several years, adding a large chunk to its balance sheet. However, recent headwinds significantly threaten the company’s crypto strategy. BTC Price Crash Limits Strategy’s Masterplan Strategy has reportedly filed an 8-K filing with plans to offload some of its digital assets. This will be done to offset current losses after the price of Bitcoin dropped below $80k. Debt repayment is at the fore of the disclosure, although it should be noted that it is a standard practice. A section of the community fears that a sustained bear market can see the institutional giant sell its assets and spark a prolonged downturn. In the past two years, Saylor has gained popularity in the crypto community for his bullish Bitcoin stance. Strategy has consistently acquired Bitcoin quarter-to-quarter becoming a major holder. The company has 528,185 BTC valued at approximately $40.3 billion purchased at an average price of $67,458 per coin. After Donald Trump’s election win, Strategy bought 275,965 BTC at an average price of $93,228. This means the company faces $4.6 billion in paper losses. President Trump’s win ignited investor appetite after most crypto enthusiasts backed his bid. Industry experts pointed to pro-Bitcoin regulations as well as an end to the Biden administration’s war on the market. In a recent filing, the company posted a $5.91 billion unrealized loss for its Bitcoin stash in Q1 2025. While its crypto portfolio fell in the previous quarter, its unrealized profit jumped 14% to approximately $5 billion. Institutional Morale Weakens Strategy remains a top driver of institutional sentiments, and with a pause in purchases, several firms will reconsider their position. The company paused BTC acquisitions in April following a major price crash below the $80k mark. The company’s stock has also faced significant pressure, falling 11% in the last 24 hours and 20% over the week. Amid the global meltdown due to President Trump’s tariffs, large investors are skeptical of moving funds to risky assets. Recession fears in the United States and Bitcoin’s persistent correlation with the stock market are major hurdles to slowing institutional demand.

This its the largest single-day outflow since February. Despite initial resilience, Bitcoin eventually followed traditional markets downward due to broader liquidity concerns. Meanwhile, ETF developments are not slowing down as Cboe BZX Exchange submitted a proposal to list a Sui (SUI) ETF. If approved, this will be the first ETF in the US to hold SUI. BlackRock also recently partnered with Anchorage Digital to boost its crypto custody infrastructure. US Tariff Turmoil Triggers Bitcoin ETF Exodus Bitcoin's relationship with traditional financial markets is once again being tested as global investors pull away from risk assets in response to escalating US trade tensions. On April 8, US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded their fourth straight day of outflows. Over $326 million was pulled out, according to Farside Investors . BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) experienced the largest outflow after shedding more than $252 million. This was its largest single-day loss since Feb. 26. Bitcoin ETF flow (Source: Farside Investors ) This wave of outflows was part of a dramatic reaction in traditional markets to US President Donald Trump’s announcement on April 2 of new reciprocal import tariffs. The policy shift sparked a historic $5 trillion sell-off in the S&P 500 over just two days. Despite this turmoil, Bitcoin initially showed some resilience by staying above the $82,000 level before tumbling below $75,000 on Sunday, April 6. According to Lennix Lai , global chief commercial officer at OKX, the lag between the equity market drop and Bitcoin’s decline proves that there is a developing nuance in the relationship between crypto and traditional assets. While the Nasdaq dropped 11% in the two days after the tariff news, Bitcoin fell only 6%. This could very likely suggest a possible decoupling trend. Lai also pointed out that Bitcoin’s 24/7 trading liquidity made it one of the very few major assets available for weekend risk-off strategies, which could explain the weekend drop. Nonetheless, Lai stated that Bitcoin’s price is still fundamentally tied to global liquidity conditions. Even as correlations with traditional equities seem to weaken, the cryptocurrency still responds to broader financial pressures, especially those impacting global capital flows. Lai explained that gold continues to serve as a traditional hedge against geopolitical instability, but Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a strategic reserve asset by investors who are looking to diversify in turbulent markets. Arthur Hayes, the co-founder of BitMEX and CIO of Maelstrom, pointed out that Bitcoin’s price movements are largely driven by market expectations around the future supply of fiat money. While short-term volatility persists, Bitcoin’s long-term conceptual role as a store of value is gaining more ground among investors navigating an increasingly uncertain global economy. Sui ETF Bid Hits SEC Desk The market turmoil certainty does not deter companies from issuing more ETFs. Cboe BZX Exchange recently submitted a request to US regulators for permission to list an ETF backed by Sui (SUI), the native token of the Sui Network. This is according to public filings dated April 8. The proposed ETF will be issued by Canary Capital, a firm known for its focus on crypto ETFs. If approved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), this will be the first ETF in the country to hold SUI. Sui is a blockchain platform built using Move, which is a smart contract language derived from Rust, and it is designed to offer users a Web3 experience that closely mirrors traditional applications. The network currently has a total value locked (TVL) of about $1.1 billion, while its native token has a market cap of approximately $6.5 billion, according to CoinMarketCap . SUI’s market cap since launch (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Canary Capital already filed its S-1 regulatory documentation for the SUI fund in March as part of a broader strategy by the asset manager to bring a range of crypto-backed ETFs to US markets. Other proposed ETFs from Canary include funds for Litecoin, XRP, Hedera, Axelar, and Pengu. The Cboe BZX Exchange has been just as active in the ETF space as it filed in March to list Solana ETFs issued by Franklin Templeton and Fidelity. The wave of altcoin ETF filings accelerated since Jan. 20, when Donald Trump assumed office. The SEC also acknowledged dozens of proposals tied to various altcoins, including major layer-1 tokens like Solana and SUI, as well as meme coins like Dogecoin and the Trump-themed Official Trump (TRUMP) token. Despite this uptick in filings, there are still many questions around investor appetite for altcoin ETFs. While Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have attracted strong institutional interest, some analysts are skeptical about demand for funds holding lesser-known tokens. Katalin Tischhauser , the head of research at crypto bank Sygnum, said that while there is considerable buzz surrounding altcoin ETFs, it is still unclear where meaningful investor demand will actually materialize. BlackRock Taps Anchorage for Crypto Custody Companies are also not letting the market trouble stop them from bettering their crypto offerings. BlackRock announced a new partnership with Anchorage Digital to enhance its crypto custody capabilities. This will help the company keep up with the growing interest in digital assets from both retail and institutional investors. The collaboration was revealed on April 8 and will see Anchorage, the only federally chartered crypto bank in the United States, provide BlackRock with custody, staking, and settlement services for digital assets. Anchorage already supports BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, which is a $2 billion tokenized offering backed by US Treasurys and focused on real-world assets. With $11.6 trillion in assets under management, BlackRock is the world’s largest investment firm and a very dominant player in the ETF product space. The company currently holds approximately $45.3 billion in Bitcoin and $1.7 billion in Ethereum through its various ETP offerings, according to data from Arkham. While Anchorage will play a big role in BlackRock’s broader crypto strategy, Coinbase is still the custodian for the Bitcoin held in the firm’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF. Since the launch of Bitcoin ETFs in January of 2024, these products have drawn a lot of investor interest, and accumulated close to $36 billion in net inflows . However, 2025 has been riddled with unexpected volatility with inflows frequently followed by steep outflows. However, some people believe this is just part of the turbulent nature of the crypto ETF landscape. Daily flows for Bitcoin ETFs (Source: Sosovalue ) Despite the fluctuations, Bitcoin funds are still among some of the most successful ETF launches in financial history. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust specifically has stepped up as a standout performer by amassing a net inflow of $39 billion. The firm also expanded its footprint by launching a crypto ETP in Europe.

The sale coincides with Solana whales dumping the asset amid a 17% weekly decline. The crypto red wave’s grip caught altcoin traders, leading to a 5% decline in the total market cap and sentiments. Solana Bulls Lose Steam On-chain data shows four wallets linked to Pumpfun sold 84,358 SOL worth over $8 million. This was the same amount the launchpad deposited into Kraken hours before the sale. As expected, the sale drove down sentiment as traders panicked. A few hours after the sale, SOL price dipped 4% to $103.5 amid the market turmoil. This week, Solana’s price plunged below the support as traders fell to heightened sell pressures. The asset is down 17% this week and 19% in the past 30 days. Solana whales are moving large amounts of assets to centralized exchanges, pointing to potential sales. The asset’s downtrend is fueling major exits from institutional and retail traders. According to Lookonchain, a whale sold 100,000 SOL worth $10.7 million. Another whale unstaked 159,028 SOL and transferred 60,000 tokens worth about $6.18 million. Massive outflows affected the Solana meme coin market as crypto prices tanked. These assets dropped 5% while meme coins like TRUMP and BONK fell over 20% in the last seven days. On the flipside, SOL bulls are locked in for a recovery, setting sights past the $130 resistance. Most traders signal the spot Solana ETF approval in the United States as a needed catalyst to move past $200. These funds will attract institutional momentum to the SOL growth trajectory. Expert trader Ali Martinez highlighted bull plot to fuel over 35% growth. “ TD Sequential flashes buy signal on the #Solana weekly chart! $SOL needs to stay above $95 and break $121 to set the stage for a rally toward $147,” he wrote on X. Wider Market Decline Edges On Digital asset prices went downhill as the aftereffects of President Trump’s sweeping tariffs kicked in. At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $76,779, falling 4% in the last 24 hours. The market leader’s decline triggered massive setbacks for altcoins. Ethereum traders lost the $1,500 support, with the asset down 7% in 24 hours. XRP posted a similar daily performance after its price dropped to $1.79. The ADA price fell 6.7%.

It would also boost the status of Ripple USD ($RLUSD) as a stablecoin. $RLUSD is expected to be used as collateral in Hidden Road’s brokerage services, lending the crypto more credibility.Hidden Road will also shift its post-trade operations to the XRP Ledger, strengthening its bid as a scalable and cost-efficient blockchain for use by large institutional players. Hidden Road gets the opportunity to explore new markets and grow globally. It also looks to become a more blockchain-native prime broker by leveraging Ripple’s experience with digital asset infrastructure. The New 2X Leveraged XRP ETF In related news, Teucrium Investment Advisors announced the launch of a 2X leveraged XRP ETF on NYSE Arca on April 8. As the name suggests, the fund will move up to 2x correlation with the $XRP token and is aimed at short-term and day traders. This comes at a time when a bunch of XRP ETF proposals are pending with the SEC. Ever since the first Bitcoin ETF was approved, there has been a swarm of applications for an ETF linked to cryptocurrencies, such as Dogecoin, Solana, Litecoin, and XRP. In light of Trump’s pro-crypto regulations and increasing fund flow in crypto assets amidst sluggish digital asset performance, this can be a perfect time to follow the classic ‘buy the dip’ strategy. Although the crypto markets have tanked during the past month, the low prices are ripe for the plucking, while the industry just keeps reaching new highs of innovation. If you’re looking to invest in value-driven crypto assets with great potential, here are a few tokens you just can’t afford to ignore. 1. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Token Building Debut Solana L2 Most Likely to Be the Next Crypto to Explode Solaxy ($SOLX) is among the best cryptos to buy now if you’re after utility-based meme coins that have both market hype and fundamentals in their corner. By building the first-ever Layer 2 protocol on the OG home of the meme coins, Solana, Solaxy aims to revitalize the entire crypto industry. That’s some goal for a startup token, but one for which it’s raised nearly $30M in presale already. The plan is to make a way to process a sizable portion of Solana’s total transactions on a side chain built on Ethereum. This will significantly reduce the burden on Solana’s mainnet, which has been overloaded because of the spike in activity on the network after the launch of hugely popular meme coins like $TRUMP and $MELANIA. Additionally, Solaxy will process transactions in batches. That way, in addition to making Solana quicker and more efficient, Solaxy will also make it more affordable. Given Solaxy’s potential to help Solana remain the home of the meme coins, it’s predicted to reach $0.2 by 2030 . That’s a nearly 12,000% gain over $SOLX’s current price of $0.001688. You can buy this extra cheap crypto by visiting the official Solaxy website . For more info, here’s a guide on how to buy $SOLX . 2. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Token Behind the Best Crypto Wallet on the Market Right Now Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the native token of the Best Wallet App , which is a secure and easy-to-use crypto wallet . As part of its promise to put the power back in the hands of crypto investors, Best Wallet is fully non-custodial. This means you have total control over the private keys of your wallet. In other words, no one can access your stored crypto, not even the people at Best Wallet. Next, it uses class-leading cryptographic techniques and provides reliable 2FA/MFA to ensure watertight privacy and security. What’s more, Best Wallet is also the only crypto wallet that lets you directly buy top meme coins on presale from within the app. The app aims to capture over 40% of the non-custodial crypto wallet market by 2026. Buy the $BEST token, and you can ride that growth all the way to the bank. $BEST holders enjoy other perks: lower transaction fees on Best Wallet and staking rewards (currently 134%), as well as early-bird access to the best crypto presales . The good news is $BEST is still in presale, where it’s raised over $11.6M so far. Here’s more on how to buy $BEST ; one token is going for a low $0.02465 at the time of publishing. 3. OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP) – Token of Crypto President Trump $TRUMP, Donald Trump’s very own meme coin, is clearly in troubled waters right now. But its low price right now isn’t the only reason we think it could be one of the best cryptos to invest in today . The biggest factor here is, of course, Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance. The fact that he delivered on his promise to make crypto-friendly regulatory and policy changes is nothing to sniff at. In fact, that was the sole reason $TRUMP shot up by more than 12,000% immediately after its launch. The token, which is a direct reflection of the president’s popularity among the crypto community, has indeed tanked on the back of his steadfastness regarding the reciprocal tariffs. However, with the tariffs expected to be put on hold (if not relaxed) sooner rather than later and Trump continuing his good work for crypto, $TRUMP should see green days ahead. When that happens, investors who get in now for just $7.48 per token will take home some pretty mind-boggling gains. Final Verdict While the short-term turbulence in the crypto market continues, the long-term view remains positive. This is reinforced by a slew of ETF launches and large crypto companies like Ripple aggressively expanding despite the market’s mood. While a long-term bullish outlook would see this as a perfect time to buy high-quality cryptos for less, the current volatility calls for caution. That means using only a small amount for your crypto investments, diversifying your portfolio, and, most importantly, doing your own research before investing.

Argentine lawmakers back Milei probe in Libra crypto scandal Lawmakers in Argentina’s Chamber of Deputies backed an investigation into President Javier Milei’s alleged i nvolvement in the Libra (LIBRA) cryptocurrency scandal . According to an April 8 report by local news outlet Buenos Aires Times, deputies in the lower house voted 128 to 93 in favor, with seven abstentions. The same proposal previously failed to move forward in the Senate. The news follows Milei promoting the LIBRA memecoin on social media . With the Argentine president leveraging his credibility as a government official and his 3.8 million followers, the token quickly reached $5, briefly touching a market cap of $4 billion. Milei has since faced accusations of wrongdoing, with critics claiming that LIBRA was a rug-pull scam and that he lured investors in. Lawyer Jonatan Baldiviezo, alongside Marcos Zelaya, engineer María Eva Koutsovitis and economist Claudio Lozano, a former head of Argentina’s central bank, filed a lawsuit against Milei, accusing him of fraud . According to Baldiviezo, Milei’s promotion was instrumental in an “illicit association” with the promoters of the cryptocurrency. The non-governmental organization Observatorio del Derecho a la Ciudad shared the concerns and filed a case that accused the president of promoting a scheme that reportedly resulted in over 40,000 investors losing more than $4 billion. Trump tariffs could lower crypto miner prices outside US: Hashlabs CEO US President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs could collapse US demand for Bitcoin mining rigs to the benefit of non-US miners as manufacturers will look outside the US to sell surplus stock for cheaper, says Hashlabs Mining CEO Jaran Mellerud. Mellerud said mining machine prices would likely rise in the US and fall in the rest of the world as rig makers will “need to lower prices to attract buyers in other regions.” That, he said, may allow non-US mining operations to scale up and take a larger slice of Bitcoin’s total hashrate. Trump unveiled “reciprocal tariffs” on nearly every country on April 2 and some of the largest crypto mining machine makers are based in countries such as Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia that will be hardest hit by the tariffs . Source: Jaran Mellerud Crypto mining rig makers Bitmain, MicroBT and Canaan originally moved to some of these countries to circumvent a 25% tariff that Trump imposed on China in 2018 during his last administration. Mellerud added even if Trump later drops the tariffs, “the damage is done — confidence in long-term planning has been shaken,” Mellerud said. Binance to purge 14 tokens following “vote to delist” process Binance is planning to delist 14 tokens from its platform on April 16 in a move designed to purge low-quality projects that do not adhere to the crypto exchange’s tighter listing requirements. The tokens are being delisted following a “comprehensive evaluation of multiple factors,” including the exchange’s first “vote to delist” results, where community members nominated projects with less than stellar metrics, Binance announced on April 8. Other factors included the team’s commitment to the project, development activity, trading volume and liquidity, network stability, responsiveness to Binance’s due diligence requests and new regulatory requirements. The tokens selected for delisting are Badger (BADGER), Balancer (BAL), Beta Finance (BETA), Cream Finance (CREAM), Cortex (CTXF), Aaelf (ELF), Firo (FIRO), Kava Lend (HARD), NULS (NULS), Prosper (PROS), Status (SNT), TROY (TROY), UniLend (UFT) and VIDT DAO (VIDT).

Bitcoin (BTC) mining may soon shift further offshore as U.S. miners face rising hardware costs. On Wednesday, April 9, a new report from Hashlabs Mining CEO Jaran Mellerud highlighted the economic impact of U.S. tariffs on the domestic crypto mining industry. According to the report , these tariffs could increase mining equipment costs in the U.S. by at least 22% compared to other countries. Specifically, U.S. crypto miners rely heavily on imported hardware from Asian countries such as China, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand — all of which are now subject to a minimum 24% tariff on all goods, including mining rigs. US tariffs on Bitcoin mining equipment by country of origin | Source: Hashlabs Even in the most favorable scenario — sourcing exclusively from Malaysia, which faces the lowest rate — equipment costs would still rise by 24%. However, this scenario is unrealistic, as U.S. imports come from a mix of suppliers across the region. Notably, the figures cited in the report do not yet account for the recent 50% tariff hike on Chinese goods, which raises the total tariff rate to 104%. Still, there is a mining equipment stockpile in the U.S., which will drive prices down. As these stocks are depleted, miners will likely have to pay a premium somewhere between 22% and 36% for the equipment, compared to other countries. These figures come from Ethan Vera, the CEO of Luxor crypto mining company, and are echoed in the Hashlabs Mining report. U.S. Miners scrambled to import rigs ahead of tariffs This report is in line with earlier fears by industry insiders. Gadi Glikberg, CEO of CodeStream, stated that while tariffs will slow down the growth of the US mining industry. Due to the cost of equipment impacting their return on investments, further expansion plans are unlikely. “The newly imposed tariffs are unlikely to trigger a mass exodus. However, they may slow down or redirect future expansion plans, as miners reassess the long-term cost-efficiency of scaling operations within the US,” Gadi Glikberg, CEO of CodeStream. Taras Kulyk, CEO of mining equipment brokerage Synteq Digital, revealed that his firm was working to rush deliveries before the tariff hike took effect.

Yet, there may be a twist awaiting in the second quarter. The report concluded that Q1 2025 recorded “a broad market pullback.” The reasons lie in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) underperformance, declining retail activity, macro uncertainty, a dropping exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) momentum, regulatory doubts, and decreasing investor interest resulting in thinning liquidity. Volume peaked early, the analysts found, but then decreased along market confidence. Overall, trading volume fell 40.65% in Q1, while market sentiment hit its lowest point since early 2023. Source: CMC At the same time, BTC ended the first quarter with a 10.52% drop, breaking a streak of increases in Q1 2023 (+71.77%) and Q1 2024 (+68.68%). While January started strong (+9.29%), February and March saw pullbacks. failed to recover momentum. This pullback signals growing caution in the market, driven by macro uncertainty, ETF saturation, and declining retail activity. ‍As for ETH, it fell 43.85% in Q1. This is the largest quarterly loss since 2018. “This massive underperformance versus BTC again echoes the sharp drop in the Altcoin Season Index, and showcases why market capital rotated into BTC for relative safety,” the report argues. Furthermore, 55 of the top 100 cryptocurrencies per market capitalization have recorded declines YTD. Some lost more than 25% of their value. Notably, meme coins “overwhelmingly populate the list of top losers, constituting 9 of the top 20 biggest losers.” You might also like Bitcoin, Ether Extend Losses as Investors Brace for Prolonged Tariff Impact Return to Fundamentals The report found that the crypto market shifted from “hype to fundamentals” in Q1. More precisely, it moved from meme coins and AI back to Layer 1s and DeFi. BNB Chain , Solana , and DeFi saw particular interest in late March. “This could indicate that after periods of excitement, investors return to proven ecosystems as they look for sustainable opportunities,” the report argues. BNB Chain Ecosystem is seeing a surge in retail interest, it says. It’s followed by various DeFi, infrastructure, and meme assets. Source: CMC At the same time, DeFi total value locked (TVL) did drop in Q1, from $118 billion in January to $92.9 billion by the end of March. Therefore, it fell to the November 2024 levels. This suggests decreased faith in on-chain financial applications, analysts say. Meanwhile, the stablecoin sector saw a strong quarter. Its market capitalization increased by 8.6% in 2025 so far. The total top 10 market cap stood $209.9 billion at the time of the report, briefly exceeding $210 billion at several points in time.

While Bitcoin stood above $78,000–$80,000, sentiment was “disproportionately negative.” Sentiment was likely weighed down by high volatility, thinning liquidity, and fading altcoin interest. Even by late March, as Bitcoin price and volume showed “some resilience,” sentiment was resisting recovery.

This suggests that traders lacked confidence and likely expected a reversal or correction, says the report. Meanwhile, sentiment is rising around modular chains, layer 1s , and community-led projects.

There is a “slight uptick” from the Altcoin Season Index March low, the analysts have found. This may suggest a capital rotation. “With many altcoins heavily oversold and BTC nearing psychological resistance above $85,000, any stall or consolidation in BTC could prompt traders to rotate into beaten-down alts,” the report argues. However, there are two key factors that must occur first before an altcoin season would really start, CMC says. There needs to be a stabilization in BTC price, as well as a macro or regulatory catalyst (e.g., Ethereum spot ETF approval or L2 scaling successes). Source: CMC It further added that “unless macro or regulatory catalysts reverse this psychological drag, capital rotation into risk assets like altcoins may remain limited heading into Q2.” Furthermore, historically, BTC typically sees moderate April returns, with weaker May and June. Still, a Q2 breakout is possible if macro conditions improve (e.g., interest rate cuts or stablecoin demand). ‍At the same time, following its Q1 capitulation, ETH “may be setting up for a relief rally,” while its underperformance could attract rotational inflows. That said, technicals and sentiment are weak, so an upside will need BTC stability as a base, the report concludes.

However, critics argue that much of it was performative like task forces, executive orders, and pressers without solid policy. Experts and practitioners are disappointed because there has been no real or solid regulatory changes like new rules or clear guidelines from Trump administration. Nevertheless, the Trump administration has no doubt laid a potential foundation for more meaningful regulatory changes through shifts in enforcement and rulemaking strategies. During Biden’s administration, ‘Operation Chokepoint 2.0’ was a major scandal which gained major attention. People claimed that the government was pressuring banks to cut off crypto companies. While some officials denied it, many crypto firms lost banking access, which sparked outrage and political debate. Trump’s Quick Steps Soon after taking office, Trump’s team took quick steps to fix crypto issues. Firstly, Trump quickly repealed a rule that made it hard for banks to hold digital assets. Then, on March 7, the OCC reversed a rule that forced banks to get special permission for crypto activities like custody and stablecoin reserves. Furthermore, a few weeks later, the FDIC scrapped a Biden-era rule that required banks to report their crypto plans and risks. Acting FDIC Chair Travis Hill clarified that banks should not be punished just over “Reputational Risk.” While it may take some time to see the effects of these changes, this marks a big shift which could make it much easier for crypto companies to work with banks going forward. Notably, the SEC has quietly dropped nearly all its ongoing cases against crypto firms. While this doesn’t set any legal precedent for the industry, but it signals that similar activities may not face enforcement at least for now. SEC Drops Major Cases The SEC has dropped or settled several big crypto cases, like those against Coinbase , Ripple , Cumberland DRW LLC, Consensys and Kraken , without finding them guilty. This suggests that the SEC may no longer see many crypto activities like token sales, staking, or mining as violating securities laws. While some crypto cases like those against Binance, Tron, and Gemini are still on hold. While some SEC investigations into crypto firms were active even reaching the stage of Wells notice, but many of these investigations were dropped after Trump took office. SEC’s recent actions speak volumes by dropping multiple lawsuits and investigations, particularly centered on exchanges, token issuances and staking. However, cases involving fraud and manipulation are still on hold, being more serious claims. But if the assets involved aren’t securities, the SEC may eventually back off there too. Besides, the SEC also publicly said that meme coins, proof-of-work mining (even when pooled), and stablecoins backed by U.S. dollars don’t fall under its control. This Could Just Be the Beginning While Trump’s rapid actions might seem scattered, but together it signals a major shift in US crypto policy. It’s becoming way easier and safer to build in crypto, and this could just be the start. In a recent move, the DOJ announced that it is officially shuting down its crypto crime unit as part of Trump’s push to make crypto regulations clearer and less strict. With Paul Atkins expected to be confirmed as the SEC Chair within days, this could mark a big shift in how the SEC could approach digital assets. What has the Trump administration done so far for crypto regulation? The Trump administration has taken steps to ease regulatory pressure on the crypto industry. It repealed SEC rules that restricted banks from holding crypto and reversed prior guidance requiring special permissions for crypto-related banking activities. What happened to Operation Chokepoint 2.0? This was a controversial policy under the Biden administration that allegedly pressured banks to cut off crypto firms. Trump’s team took action to reverse this by removing restrictions and guidance that had created those pressures.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MINING|REGULATION|BNB|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-09 13:56:03

The ETF is designed to deliver twice the daily returns of XRP through swap agreements. With no suitable US-listed spot XRP ETFs available, the swaps’ reference rates incorporate several European exchange-traded products. The change in U.S. government and its more pro-crypto stance helped bring the ETF to market. The filing for the ETF took place right after the prior Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) administration exited, and as soon as the standard 75-day review period passed, Teucrium seized the earliest launch window. “We filed as soon as we could after the old SEC regime left … we launched today,” CEO Sal Gilbertie said on Tuesday . “I think it’s almost at a couple hundred thousand shares.” The fund saw about four times the initial activity of Volatility Shares’ 2x Solana ETF (SOLT), propelling it into the top 5%, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. “It’s been a terrific, very successful launch — our most successful launch day to date for any fund we’ve ever done,” Gilbertie said. “There was overwhelming excitement… I think a lot because we were overlooked.” The ETF gains XRP exposure through swaps tied to European XRP ETPs but can also use other XRP-linked instruments, like futures, to enhance efficiency and cut costs. Gilbertie emphasized that the product isn’t for long-term investors. “This is absolutely a short-term trading tool — ideally for one day,” he said. “Because of the reset and the math … if that asset goes up very slowly or sideways or down, you will lose money.” Teucrium, managing roughly $320 million across 12 ETFs, is already planning an inverse XRP ETF, the Teucrium 2x Short Daily XRP ETF, a prospectus shows . This would let investors profit from XRP price drops, though Gilbertie said the firm will wait to assess demand before proceeding.",Markets|US|XRP|ETFs,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-09 13:59:15

Investors monitor crypto market conditions to determine if major coins will continue their downward trajectory through support levels since YETIO presents possible opportunities to navigate market fluctuations. Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH Struggles Below $1,500 As Sell Pressure Rises The Ethereum market value has decreased by more than 65% since reaching its highest point in 2024 to its current trading price of $1,476 . The current market value stands as the bottom point since March 2023. Technical signals such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) show weak momentum. The RSI entered oversold territory several times, suggesting possible short-term rallies but no sustained recovery. Source: X Analysts point to the $1,440–$1,500 range as crucial. Failure to stay above $1,440 could lead Ethereum price toward $1,400 or even lower. According to market analyst Ted Pillows, “A 5%–10% decline may be the final stretch before ETH attempts a rebound, depending on Federal Reserve policy shifts.” Bitcoin Price Forecast: BTC Nears Support After 30% Correction From Peak Bitcoin price fell to a yearly low of $74,508 after dropping over 5% in a single day. The decline followed sharp losses in the S&P 500 and increasing global trade tensions. Over 452,000 traders were liquidated, and over $1.3 billion was wiped from the crypto market in 24 hours. Bitcoin itself saw over $464 million in liquidations. Source: X The RSI is under 35, and the MACD shows bearish movement. Analysts expect Bitcoin price to test the $73,072 support level next. If the price rebounds, it could retest $85,000. Bitcoin’s correlation with the stock market remains but is expected to ease soon. Ripple (XRP) Price Analysis: XRP Breaks 200 EMA And Faces Selling Pressure Ripple’s XRP has fallen below the $2 mark and is trading at $1.77 . The 24-hour drop reached 14.3%, and XRP price is down more than 44% from its previous peak. XRP also broke below its 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), indicating a bearish outlook. Source: X The MACD formed a second death cross on April 7, while the RSI showed oversold conditions. Analysts are monitoring support at $1.61. A bullish golden cross appeared after 7:00 UTC, creating hope for recovery. XRP’s trading volume surged to nearly $10 billion, but most of the activity is from selling pressure. Yeti Ouro Gains Interest With Low Price And Strong Growth Potential As Ethereum, XRP, and Bitcoin face strong resistance and price drops, many investors are turning to new alternatives like Yeti Ouro (YETIO). Yeti Ouro has gained market attention for blending meme coin appeal with practical use. With over $3.23 million raised and more than 213 million tokens sold, the project is seeing fast-growing adoption as it enters the final stages of its presale. In Stage 3, the YETIO token is priced at $0.024, already making huge profits for the early investors that purchased tokens in Stage 1 at a price of $0.012, giving an ROI of 100%. Steeper price increases have been confirmed for the remaining two stages of the presale. The current stage completes in only 14 days. Yeti Go, the platform’s Play-to-Earn (P2E) racing game, is built on Unreal Engine 5 and developed by designers from hit games such as Spiderman, Call of Duty, The Witcher and Dead Space. The game delivers fast-paced action that grants real-time cryptocurrency rewards as its audio track emerged from professionals who have worked with Grammy Award nominees like Major Lazer, Vybz Kartel, and Kabaka Pyramid. The innovative convergence of blockchain technology and gaming elements has started to attract players from the gaming and blockchain industries. Below is the project and game’s central character and a showcase of its gaming world. Large buyers who purchase more than $500 worth of YETIO tokens can receive bonus tokens of 25% with 20% bonus tokens for all other purchases. The struggling prices of BTC, ETH, and XRP lead traders to consider YETIO as a promising alternative to their investment portfolios.

43124959,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/?p=42024,1744207200,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinmagazine.png,Bull Bitcoin: The Cypherpunk Bitcoin Exchange,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bull-bitcoin-the-cypherpunk-bitcoin-exchange,"Bitcoin Magazine Bull Bitcoin: The Cypherpunk Bitcoin Exchange Proving that custodial, centralized, altcoin casinos are not the only way to succeed in this industry, the privacy-focused bitcoin exchange Bull Bitcoin recently went multinational, bootstrapping a team in France and expanding its services to the whole eurozone . The move comes only a year after announcing their expansion into Costa Rica . “Bull Bitcoin is probably the longest-running Bitcoin-only, self-custodial exchange,” Theo Mogenet , Europe General Manager for Bull Bitcoin, told Bitcoin Magazine in an interview . ”When you buy Bitcoin from us, it goes straight to your wallet, we never hold client funds—and it reflects Francis’s vision of privacy and the cypherpunk ethos.” https://x.com/Bull Bitcoin_/status/1881371651251769619 Founded in Montreal, Canada, in 2013, Bull Bitcoin ’s primary claim to fame is its noncustodial exchange model. Rather than take your fiat and credit a bitcoin balance to your account on their books, Bull Bitcoin forces users to input a Bitcoin public address before purchase. This ensures that when fiat lands on their account, they can quickly pay out the bitcoin to the user’s wallet of choice. They’ve also been early and active supporters of the Lightning Network and Liquid Network , and have even integrated PayJoin into their platform, all of which offer significant privacy benefits to their users. Finally, they have developed a line of products focused not on trading and speculation but on using bitcoin as money. Bull Bitcoin enables users to pay their monthly bills with bitcoin such as rent, electricity, data plans, and as of late even buy real estate. They also have a Bitcoin wallet app that is still in its early stages, but is quickly gathering a strong list of features. One subtle but powerful difference between Bull Bitcoin and most other exchanges is their bitcoin-only stance, which rejects selling altcoins that are the bread and butter of most exchanges — monetizing the speculative fervor of the crypto markets. Bull Bitcoin ignores the whole crypto market, focusing only on bitcoin, which allows it to deploy cutting-edge technologies before many of its competitors. The team at Bull Bitcoin thereby doesn’t run the compliance risk or carry technical debt that comes naturally with supporting hundreds of different altcoins. The result is a profitable company with a lean and mean team that has now gone international. Privacy is Not a Crime The final piece to Bull Bitcoin’s success might be its founding story. Started by French-Canadian entrepreneur and Bitcoin Maximalist Francis Pouliot , the company has been entirely self-funded, receiving no VC money so far. While sticking to the early cypherpunk vision of bitcoin as sovereign money could not have been easy, it has enabled the company to make decisions and employ strategies that other exchanges often avoid. Now, they are entering the EU in an era where many other cryptocurrency businesses are exiting the union. Companies like Deribit left Europe years ago and even giants like Tether are being squeezed out from the European Union due to regulatory pressure . Bull Bitcoin has instead dove in, seeing an opportunity to reach an underserved market. On the compliance front, Bull Bitcoin has taken a very different approach than other market participants. Rather than over-comply out of an abundance of caution as seen with many crypto exchanges, they have stuck to the letter of the law, and looked for ways to defend their users from overzealous regulators or politicians. “We have a lot of experience dealing with the government. We come from Canada so we are used to government oversight. The compliance burden of the European Union, although much higher than Canada, doesn’t scare us,” Francis Pouliot told Bitcoin Magazine. Theo Mogenet added: “We have certain obligations in terms of fighting money laundering — that we cannot really circumvent. But as you mentioned, when, for example, a government, be it in Canada or here in Europe, will ask for a bulk of transactions without any judicial mandate, without any legal basis to do so, our policy is just to fight back and make sure that we can use every piece of legislation that is out there — to basically push back on the government’s demand.” Expansion into Costa Rica Bull Bitcoin’s expansion is not limited to Canada and Europe. In recent years, Bull Bitcoin started making inroads into Costa Rica, marking their entrance into Latin American markets, an ecosystem often driven by peer-to-peer payments and low-tech infrastructure. Becoming the first “Bitcoin exchange in the country,” it quickly integrated with the very popular mobile text payments service SINPE Móvil, allowing users to trade sats for fiat quickly and in a way the local population was familiar with. The result seems to have been a quick expansion of adoption among farmers markets and other produce retailers, which often feature videos from Francis and the team, enjoying the Central-American weather. The move to Costa Rica was famously driven by an escape from the Covid restrictions in Canada, which Francis protested and opposed. Bull Bitcoin soon partnered with the Bitcoin Jungle , an open source grassroots effort similar to the Bitcoin Beach community in El Salvador, which maps and educates Costa Rican locals on how to benefit from bitcoin and leverage it as a money and ecosystem. The Burdens of Self-Custody Bull Bitcoin’s commitment to cypherpunk values has not come without challenges. Self-custody in particular, while removing a great burden from the company in terms of compliance and security risk, demands a more educated user base and very responsive support team. Boasting a self-hosted “simple chat system” for customer support that even Francis himself will at times run, the approach allows users fast and reliable access to a savvy Bitcoiner who can give them a quick turnaround, without relying on third party platforms. “In our case, it’s a self-hosted permanent chat. So it’s running on our servers. Like no client data is shared with outside parties. And you will basically chat with a human, usually like, for example, in Europe, it would often be me or Jimmy or customer support officer. Sometimes it’s even Francis that is answering to clients,” said Theo Mogenet about their customer support process. They have processes designed to help prevent users from getting scammed as well, going as far as to calling their users when they are in a customer support track. “We can also have like a 10-, 15-minute conversation with them to make sure that they know what a Bitcoin wallet is, what the risks with self-custody are to be sure that they are not pressured or pushed by someone to do that,” Theo explained on the podcast. Phishing scams are a common issue for Bitcoin and crypto exchanges, and naive users get talked into buying crypto to send to scammers, in order to relieve pressure from various lies or pressure tactics. Besides their active support team, in 2022 Bull Bitcoin acquired Veriphi , a “white glove service provider for Bitcoin self custody”. The firm had deep roots in the Bitcoin Quebec scene and developed a lot of experience with advanced self-custody consulting. Today, this service is integrated into their product line with a dedicated website at bitcoinsupport.com , offering users a range of consulting and education packages to move them along the journey into bitcoin self-custody with proper guidance. Self-Hosted Infrastructure: The Fork War The focus on self-hosted infrastructure did not come from a place of ideology alone, but was a hard-earned lesson from the 2017 Bitcoin fork war—the internal conflict within the Bitcoin industry about what path Bitcoin scaling development should take and who got to decide this. In a 2017 speech, for example, Francis Pouliot explained the dilemmas the Bitcoin community faced at the time, the game theory of economic nodes, and the thesis of Bitcoin consensus that ultimately emerged victorious. Faced with a faction of the Bitcoin community called Bitcoin Unlimited that wished to scale Bitcoin by increasing the block size—a technical option rejected by Bitcoin Core developers at the time—Francis Pouliot and the Bull Bitcoin team led an effort to educate and rally Canadian Bitcoin businesses against the proposed hard fork, as seen in this letter of intent from 2017 signed by 16 Canadian businesses. Bull Bitcoin also began building Cyphernode , a “modular Bitcoin full-node microservices API server architecture and utilities toolkit to build scalable, secure, and featureful apps and services without trusted third parties.” This software suite, launched as open-source software a year later, allowed Bull Bitcoin and associated companies to take a stand in that schism with software they had full control over, enabling them to choose which version of Bitcoin to signal support for and which version of Bitcoin to follow in the event of a contentious bifurcation of the network. That software independence would prove useful against another front in this culture war: a corporate alliance of mining pools, data service providers, and exchanges that would soon join the fray and pursue a different consensus change to the Bitcoin protocol, known as the NY Agreement, which supported a version of Bitcoin called SegWit2x. The mighty corporate alliance included giants such as Blockchain.com, Coinbase, and 50 others, including mining pools that on paper had more than 80% of hashing power behind them, yet also challenged developer and community consensus . Both Bitcoin Unlimited and the NY Agreement coalition would end up losing this fork war to community and developer consensus, who used tools similar to Cyphernode (UASF) and stood behind the backwards-compatible SegWit soft fork, a scaling solution for Bitcoin that maintained consensus with older versions of Bitcoin and would eventually prove victorious. Bull Bitcoin’s role in defending the decentralization of Bitcoin in 2017, alongside their alignment with cypherpunk values for over a decade, places them comfortably as legends in the annals of Bitcoin history.

Member of Parliament Rickard Nordin submitted a request to the Finance Minister, Elisabeth Svantesson, to reconsider the country’s foreign exchange reserve management. Sweden Considers Adding Bitcoin To Foreign Exchange Reserves Joining the growing list of countries exploring Bitcoin as a reserve asset, Sweden is set to diversify its foreign currency reserves. The request submitted by Rickard Nordin to the Finance Minister underscores the potential of a Bitcoin reserve, exemplifying it with other nations’ financial strategies. The MP’s statement read, “In light of this, I would like to ask Minister of Finance Elisabeth Svantesson whether she and the government are prepared to consider including Bitcoin in the foreign exchange reserve.” Rickard Nordin pointed to El Salvador as a notable example, highlighting its pioneering move to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. He also cited multiple central banks’ discussions on the potential of BTC and its influence on the global financial landscape. Sweden’s Cautious Stance on Crypto It’s noteworthy that the Swedish Parliament Member’s Bitcoin proposal comes amidst the country’s cautious stance on cryptocurrencies. Previously, in March 2024, Riksbank Governor Erik Thedéen expressed his skepticism toward BTC, citing its volatility and inherent risks. He posited that BTC has no place in Sweden. Citing its speculative nature, Thedéen stated that less exposure to Bitcoin is better for the country. However, no regulations or laws in the Swedish government currently restrict Bitcoin’s inclusion in the foreign exchange reserve. Thus, Nordin’s request has sparked discussions on potential policy shifts in the country’s financial economy. What Drives Global Quest for Bitcoin Reserve? Significantly, the global quest for a Bitcoin reserve is primarily driven by US President Donald Trump’s crypto-focused policies. During his 2024 election campaign, Trump endorsed BTC as the world’s superpower, promising to turn America into a crypto capital. Trump’s Executive Order In March 2025, Donald Trump signed an executive order to establish Bitcoin as the country’s strategic reserve. This has sparked widespread optimism, with BTC maximalists celebrating it as the community’s victory. Global Powers Embrace BTC Influenced by Trump’s policies, countries like Switzerland, Poland, Germany, Japan, and more are exploring the possibilities of adopting a Bitcoin reserve. North Korea’s increasing accumulation of BTC has also sparked speculations of the country’s approach to a crypto reserve.

Speaking to a crowd of House Republicans, Trump claimed that other countries “are calling us up, kissing my ass” for a trade deal. His remarks drew laughter from the audience. Imitating foreign leaders, he added, “Please, please, sir, make a deal. I’ll do anything.” The event took place just hours before a major hike in U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods came into effect. Starting Wednesday, April 9, the tariffs on Chinese imports jumped to 104%, as confirmed by a White House official speaking to CNBC. The increase followed Trump’s demand that China drop its 34% retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods by Tuesday. Trump had threatened to double U.S. tariffs if Beijing failed to meet a firm noon deadline. With no change from Beijing, the U.S. followed through with the hike. During the same address, Trump also mocked fellow Republicans who have called for Congress to take over international trade negotiations. “Let me tell you, you don’t negotiate like I negotiate,” he said. Trump will announce tariffs on pharmaceuticals soon In another major announcement, Trump revealed plans to impose what he called “major” tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals. He told the audience, “We’re going to be announcing very shortly a major tariff on pharmaceuticals. And when they hear that, they will leave China.” Trump also recently told reporters aboard Air Force One that these pharmaceutical tariffs will arrive “at a level that you haven’t really seen before.” He said they would be announced “in the near future.” If implemented, this move would mark a major shift in the global pharmaceutical trade. For decades, most countries—including the U.S.—have imposed few or no tariffs on finished medicines. This has been in line with a 1995 World Trade Organization agreement aimed at keeping drug prices low. The proposed tariffs come on the heels of Trump’s blanket 10% tariff on all imports announced last week. The administration has framed the new measures as “reciprocal,” arguing that they are meant to correct trade imbalances and bring manufacturing back to the United States. Markets reacted quickly. Indian pharmaceutical stocks dropped sharply following the news. India exports about one-third of its $13 billion annual pharmaceutical output to the United States. Currently, those drugs enter the U.S. market with little or no import tax. In contrast, India imposes nearly 11% duties on American medicines. Indian pharmaceutical companies warned that higher U.S. tariffs could force them to raise prices, which could lead to increased medical costs for American consumers. While firms like Cipla and Dr. Reddy’s have manufacturing facilities in the U.S., most of their generic drug production remains in India. Executives say shifting production to the U.S. is not economically viable due to the low margins on generic drugs. Tariffs can disrupt distribution from multinational companies like Pfizer and GSK European drugmakers are also raising concerns. On Tuesday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen met with leaders from top pharmaceutical firms to discuss the potential fallout. Following the meeting, the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) issued a warning. The EFPIA, whose members include Bayer, Novartis, and Novo Nordisk, said the proposed tariffs could shift pharmaceutical production away from Europe and into the U.S. They expressed concern that such a move would damage Europe’s status as a global pharmaceutical hub. Pharmaceuticals were the European Union’s top export to the U.S. in 2024, totaling $127 billion (€100 billion). The EFPIA urged European policymakers to respond quickly and consider changes that could prevent a “mass exodus” of pharmaceutical companies to the U.S. There are also concerns about possible retaliatory tariffs from the EU. Multinational drugmakers such as Pfizer and GSK operate in several countries. These include Germany and Ireland. Hence, changes in tariffs could disrupt production and distribution across multiple regions. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/ethereums-decentralized-exchange-volume-drops-to-12-month-low-here-are-the-details/,"Ethereum’s decentralized exchange volume has slowed, with daily traders dropping to a 12-month low of around 40,000 addresses, a sharp decline from the peak of 95,000 observed in late 2024. Ethereum's DEX Volume Has Halved Since December Peak This sharp decline in DEX participation coincides with a further cooling of the market in the crypto world and a decrease in speculative capital flows. Uniswap continues to be the dominant force in the Ethereum DEX ecosystem, eclipsing competitors like SushiSwap which currently only attracts around 2,000 daily active addresses. Trading volumes have shrunk along with user participation, with Ethereum DEX volume falling to $57 billion in March 2025, nearly half of the $112 billion recorded at the market peak in December 2024. This volume decline reflects both reduced user activity and potentially smaller average trade sizes as market participants take more cautious positions. Despite this contraction, decentralized exchanges continue to account for approximately 13% of total spot trading volume compared to centralized exchanges, continuing the gradual upward trend observed in recent years. The current landscape highlights the persistent advantages and disadvantages between centralized and decentralized trading platforms. Centralized exchanges continue to offer superior liquidity, lower transaction costs, and faster execution for most standard trading activities. However, innovations from DEX aggregators like Bebop and CoWSwap are increasingly narrowing these gaps by optimizing routing, reducing slippage, and improving the overall user experience. While Layer 2 solutions like Base are achieving significant transaction volume, Solana continues to establish itself as a significant alternative transaction venue. This redistribution suggests that while Ethereum’s native DEX activity has decreased, investors are still interested in exploring cost-effective venues rather than exiting decentralized trading entirely. *This is not investment advice.

According to a recent regulatory filing , Strategy revealed it may be forced to sell some of its Bitcoin holdings to meet financial obligations, potentially below cost basis. Strategy warns that a major drop in Bitcoin’s price could hurt its ability to meet financial obligations. In its filing, the company says it may need to sell $BTC—possibly at a loss—if it can’t raise money through other means. pic.twitter.com/yRTpuxwUP9 — Satoshi Club (@esatoshiclub) April 9, 2025 The company currently holds around 528,185 BTC, acquired at an average cost of $67,458, amounting to more than $35 billion in investments. Yet, with Bitcoin now trading low, close to that level, the firm’s unrealized losses are swelling, approaching $6 billion in Q1 alone. Strategy has acquired 22,048 BTC for ~$1.92 billion at ~$86,969 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 11.0% YTD 2025. As of 3/30/2025, we hodl 528,185 $BTC acquired for ~$35.63 billion at ~$67,458 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRK $STRF https://t.co/qbeAVthyQw — Strategy (@Strategy) March 31, 2025 Despite a $1.69 billion income tax benefit softening the blow, the financial strain is intensifying. Strategy’s debt burden stands at $8 billion, with $35 million in annual interest and $150 million in yearly dividends further tightening the noose. The firm’s software operations no longer generate enough revenue to sustain these obligations, and the long-touted promise of Bitcoin’s perpetual appreciation is being put to a brutal test. Strategy’s BTC Bet Turns Into a Liability Strategy’s Bitcoin playbook was initially praised for entering Bitcoin early, ahead of the 2021 bull run; the company expanded its holdings through a mix of convertible debt and equity offerings. At one point, this fueled massive investor confidence and helped Strategy gain a coveted spot on the Nasdaq 100. But what worked in a rising market now threatens the firm as the tide turns. As of March 2025, Strategy had acquired 275,965 BTC since November 2024 alone, at an average price of $93,228. With Bitcoin trading at around $77,000, that tranche alone accounts for nearly $4.6 billion in unrealized losses. Source: Cryptonews The filing submitted to the SEC clearly states the pressure. Without fresh funding, either through new equity or debt, the company could be forced to liquidate some of its Bitcoin holdings. “We may be required to make such sales at prices below our cost basis or that are otherwise unfavorable,” the filing warns. This reality stands in stark contrast to Michael Saylor’s previous assertions. The co-founder and executive chairman once claimed that even if Bitcoin dropped to $1,000, Strategy wouldn’t be forced to sell. Michael Saylor says, ""It’s not debt, it’s convertible debt. #Bitcoin could go from $100K to $1K, the debt is not going to get called, there is no recourse.” pic.twitter.com/Ljl8PEl8dm — ₿itcoinTeddy (@Bitcoin_Teddy) February 24, 2025 Wall Street Tensions and Recession Fears Could Fuel Further Bitcoin Price Pressure Growing concern about a looming U.S. recession, further complicating Strategy’s predicament, adds fuel to the fire. Goldman Sachs now predicts a 45% chance of a recession in the next year — that’s higher odds than any time during the post-pandemic inflation and interest rate hikes. pic.twitter.com/nPSZqece1m — Steven Rattner (@SteveRattner) April 7, 2025 Goldman Sachs recently increased the probability of a U.S. recession to 45%, citing escalating trade tensions and weakening global markets. This marked the second revision in just one week, reflecting increasing anxiety among institutional investors. Goldman revised its 2025 GDP forecast downward to 1.3%, while J.P. Morgan sees a potential contraction of 0.3%. BREAKING: As the DOW plunges again, JP Morgan's Jamie Dimon, just suggested that we are headed towards a recession that he thinks “we will see more credit problems than people have seen in a long time.” What a complete mess that was totally unavoidable. TRUMPCRASH! pic.twitter.com/o4NJ1ehk18 — Brian Krassenstein (@krassenstein) April 9, 2025 Morgan Stanley noted that although a recession is not their base case, it is now an increasingly likely bear scenario. These forecasts matter greatly to Bitcoin and, by extension, to Strategy. In times of economic uncertainty, risk assets like Bitcoin often come under selling pressure. Compounding this is the Federal Reserve’s ambiguous stance on interest rate cuts. While Goldman expects three cuts starting in June, traders now anticipate rate reductions in at least four of the five remaining Fed meetings. China knows that Trump wants lower interest rates. So instead of responding with tariffs, they are offloading an extra $50 billion in treasuries to push interest rates higher. China holds $700 billion in US treasuries btw. pic.twitter.com/Y8utulh16R — ADAM (@AdameMedia) April 8, 2025 Such macroeconomic instability could create further headwinds for Bitcoin, putting Strategy in an even tighter spot. If BTC slips below Strategy’s average cost basis of $67,000, market sentiment could sour quickly, potentially triggering a wave of panic selling. In many ways, Strategy now stands at a crossroads.

Some analyses suggest that the market could drop lower, led by Bitcoin, while others indicate that this might be the bottom, regardless of whether the trade war persists. What Next For Crypto Market As China, EU Announce Tariffs The crypto market is at risk of a further crash, with the Bitcoin price possibly dropping to new lows following China and the EU’s announcement of retaliatory tariffs on US goods. According to a CNN report , China announced 84% tariffs on US imports, which will become effective from April 10. Meanwhile, the EU has announced plans to impose 10% and 25% tariffs on US imports, effective April 15. As CoinGape reported, the crypto market witnessed another crash yesterday following news that the US would impose 104% tariffs on China, which took effect today. Crypto analysts such as Rekt Capital have suggested that the Bitcoin price risks dropping lower in the short term amid this tariff war. In an X post, Rekt Capital stated that BTC is experiencing downside continuation after upside wicking into the early March weekly lows. He added that having confirmed this red level as new resistance, the Bitcoin price is now dropping into the $71,000 to $83,000 volume gap to fill this market inefficiency. Meanwhile, crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto suggested that BTC could still drop lower to suck the liquidity at the higher timeframe demand between $69,000 and $74,000. Bullish Case For The Market Market expert Anthony Pompliano has again raised the possibility of the US Federal Reserve intervening in the tariff war by announcing an emergency cut rate. Pompliano noted that the increasing 10-year yield likely pushes the Fed closer to acting in emergency fashion. As CoinGape reported, Fed Chair Jerome Powell could announce an emergency rate cut as Trump’s tariffs persist. This would be bullish for the crypto market, as the US Central Bank’s easing monetary policies would inject more liquidity into crypto assets. US President Donald Trump also recently stated that it is a great time to buy, which could mark the bottom for the market. Crypto analyst MikyBull Crypto noted that the president has made the same statement on two occasions, which marked the bottom. The first was in October 2018, with the market bottoming two and a half months later, while the second was in March 2020, with the market bottoming one to two weeks later.

With Bitcoin ($BTC) still trading above its 21-day exponential moving average (EMA), EGRAG emphasizes there’s “no need to worry,” while laying out three potential scenarios that could define the rest of this market cycle. The analysis carries weight for both Bitcoin maximalists and altcoin investors alike, highlighting massive opportunity across the digital asset spectrum—provided investors understand how cycles and liquidity flows work. #BTC -We Are Still in a Bull Run-ONLY FEW As long as #BTC is trending above the 21 EMA, there’s no need to worry! Here are three scenarios for #BTC : Retracement: The peak was $109K, and #BTC may retrace to Fib 0.702 ($97K). During this phase. #Alts will outperform… pic.twitter.com/dtqPyk0UUB — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) April 9, 2025 Bitcoin’s Key Technical Support: The 21 EMA The 21 EMA is widely regarded as a dynamic support level in trending markets, especially during bull runs. EGRAG underscores this point, stating that as long as BTC remains above this moving average, there is no structural reason to fear a reversal. This technical reassurance anchors his broader argument: we are still firmly within an uptrend, and the bull run is far from over. Scenario One: A Healthy Retracement to Fibonacci 0.702 In EGRAG’s first scenario, Bitcoin peaks at $109,000 and retraces to the key Fibonacci 0.702 level, which sits around $97,000. Rather than seeing this as a bearish development, he frames it as a healthy correction—one that historically marks a rotation point for capital to flow into altcoins. During this phase, EGRAG suggests that altcoins could outperform Bitcoin, creating an optimal window for traders to extract significant profits. He also issues a timely reminder: take profits when they come, as this phase can be both lucrative and short-lived. Scenario Two: Bitcoin Hits a New All-Time High of $177K The second scenario reflects a continued bullish breakout with Bitcoin targeting the Fibonacci 1.618 extension, landing at approximately $177,000. This target isn’t merely a speculative moonshot; it’s rooted in widely accepted fib-based technical analysis and reflects a natural expansion beyond previous cycle highs. In this environment, altcoins aren’t just expected to rise—they could explode. EGRAG estimates that many could yield gains between 10X to 20X from current levels, reigniting the speculative fervor that defined previous alt seasons. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Scenario Three: ATH Expansion Mode and the Power of Liquidity In what EGRAG dubs the “wildest scenario,” Bitcoin enters ATH expansion mode—fueled by a confluence of macroeconomic factors including renewed liquidity injections, interest rate cuts, and possibly more fiscal stimulus. If this scenario plays out, it could redefine what’s possible in this market cycle. Small-cap altcoins could deliver 50X to 100X returns, while mid-caps might routinely post 30X gains. While such explosive growth may seem implausible to some, EGRAG reminds his audience that those who fail to understand liquidity cycles are often the loudest critics—and the least prepared when the market turns. Gold and the Liquidity Equation Interestingly, EGRAG also introduces a cross-market liquidity thesis by identifying gold as a potential source of fresh capital. As traditional investors cycle profits from soaring commodities like gold , that liquidity could flow into riskier assets like Bitcoin and altcoins, particularly as inflationary pressures ease and monetary conditions loosen. Understand the Cycle or Get Left Behind EGRAG Crypto’s message is clear: market cycles matter, and liquidity is king. While price volatility may shake out weak hands, long-term investors who understand the broader macro-technical picture have little to fear—and possibly much to gain. His blend of technical analysis, macro insights, and historical context makes a strong case for why we are still in a bull run and why the next leg could be more explosive than anything we’ve seen before. Whether Bitcoin retraces to $97K or soars to $177K and beyond, the critical takeaway is this: the cycle is still alive, and for those who pay attention, the opportunities could be generational.

Griffith, 41, was arrested in 2019 following a controversial trip to North Korea, where he gave a presentation at a cryptocurrency conference in Pyongyang. U.S. prosecutors alleged that his talk, titled “Blockchain for Peace,” explained how the country could use crypto to evade sanctions and launder money. Griffith pleaded guilty in 2021 to one count of conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and was sentenced to 63 months in prison and a $100,000 fine in 2022. VIRGIL GRIFFITH IS OUT OF PRISON!!! just released this morning! he'll be in a halfway house for a few weeks, and parole after that with work restrictions (so a pardon is still important), but HE IS OUT 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 pic.twitter.com/Q4jRZmryGk — brantly.eth (@BrantlyMillegan) April 9, 2025 On July 16, U.S. District Judge Kevin Castel reduced Griffith’s sentence to 56 months, effective August 2, citing his lack of prior criminal history and the hardships he endured while in custody. While acknowledging Griffith’s disciplinary infractions in prison, the judge noted that the threat he poses to the public has “somewhat dissipated.” You might also like: ZA Miner poised to surpass traditional methods, attracting XRP and DOGE investors Griffith’s ‘curiosity’ Griffith’s legal team has long argued that his presentation contained publicly available information and that he was driven more by academic curiosity than criminal intent. One lawyer described the trip as the “culmination of Virgil’s unfortunate obsession with North Korea.” A respected figure in Ethereum’s ( ETH ) early development and a key contributor to the Ethereum Name Service, Griffith’s case drew attention from both crypto advocates and national security circles. His release comes as North Korean-linked hacking groups like Lazarus continue to target crypto firms, stealing billions in digital assets over the past decade. Griffith is currently held in a federal prison in Michigan and is expected to be released shortly after the August 2 order takes effect.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) was not spared from the selloff, plummeting to $0.00001038 - its lowest level since February 2023 - as investors fled risk assets following President Trump's announcement of new tariff policies. The meme coin's dramatic decline came despite positive developments within its ecosystem, including Shibarium's achievement of processing over 1 billion transactions. The layer-2 scaling solution has now processed more than 10.3 million blocks since its launch, averaging approximately 4.4 million daily transactions, making it one of the fastest-growing networks on Ethereum. Some technical analysts note that SHIB has formed a potential double-bottom pattern around the $0.00001050 support level. Recent price action shows signs of recovery as the asset reclaims the $0.00001097 level with increasing volume. However, with SHIB's open interest declining by $454 million since January and funding rates turning negative, short-term bearish sentiment remains strong despite the potential for continuation toward the $0.00001150 resistance zone if current support holds, according to CoinDesk Research technical analysis model. Technical Analysis Highlights SHIB experienced a 16.2% decline from $0.00001239 to $0.00001038 on April 7th. During the sell-off, unusually high trading volumes exceeded 3.6 billion. A clear double bottom pattern formed around the $0.00001050 support level, followed by the establishment of an uptrend channel with resistance at $0.00001108. Recent price action shows bullish momentum with increasing volume as SHIB reclaimed the $0.00001097 level with consecutive higher lows. After reaching a low of $0.000010939, the asset established a higher low at $0.000010949, followed by a significant upward movement to $0.000010985, representing a 4.2% gain from the session low. An ascending channel formed with support at $0.000010965, while increased trading volume during upward movements (particularly the 29.8M volume spike at 09:08) confirms strengthening bullish momentum. Recent consolidation between $0.000010970 and $0.000010973 suggests accumulation before potential continuation toward the $0.000010990 resistance level.

The National Securities and Exchange Commission of Ukraine (NSSMC) has presented a comprehensive proposal for taxation of cryptocurrencies. Designed to be compatible with global practices, the proposal will provide much-needed clarity on how crypto-related activities such as mining, staking and airdrops will be taxed. The proposal, which has been shared publicly, proposes an 18% personal income tax and an additional 5% military tax on digital asset earnings. The proposal includes preferential tax rates of 5% and 9% for certain categories, as an alternative to the standard 18% tax. The proposal states that crypto-to-crypto transactions would be exempt from tax, while mining, staking, and airdrops would be taxed. The proposal is currently in parliament for review. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Ukraine Prepares for Tax on Bitcoin (BTC) and Cryptocurrencies!

On-chain data from Arkham shows that a wallet closely tied to World Liberty Financial sold 5,471 ETH for around $8 million on Wednesday after racking up a $125 million loss. The sale comes just two months after Eric Trump, the U.S. president's son, said it was a great time to buy ETH, which was trading at $2,880. The main World Liberty Financial wallet still holds $98 million worth of crypto, $11.7 million of which is in ether.

These 3 Altcoins Could Make You Millions in 100 Days,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/time-to-enter-the-market-these-3-altcoins-could-make-you-millions-in-100-days/,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Cardano are among the most popular altcoins in the markets right now and they are back to gaining the value they lost in the market crash of Monday. Black Monday, as it’s being called, saw crypto as well as other markets crash badly on rising concerns about geopolitical situations, the escalating tariff war, and fears of a recession. However, while these concerns are valid, crypto saw billions of dollars in the form of longs and shorts being liquidated. The values of Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Cardano dropped significantly, along with most other cryptos. Smart investors are moving in now to pick up their choice of altcoins for future growth at their current dips to book good bargains. Many investors are picking up IntelMarkets along with Cardano and Shiba Inu (SHIB) to build a strong growth portfolio for the next quarter. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Recovering As Bargain Buyers Boost Demand In the aftermath of Monday’s crash, the crypto market is getting substantial support from whales and bargain hunters as they help boost the Shiba Inu (SHIB) price. The Shiba Inu (SHIB) lost over 17% in value between April 6 and 7 as it dropped from $0.000012 to $0.000010. However, the recovery started on late Monday as the Shiba Inu (SHIB) regained about 9% value as it touched $0.000011. Current trading in the Shiba Inu (SHIB) charts is creating a rising trend as the price gained and then lost approximately 5% value. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently trading at $0.000011 as community sentiment remains bullish, and bulls remain in control of the narrative. Cardano Regains 10% Value As Markets Recover The Cardano price chart shows a recovery trend over the past 24 hours. Cardano dropped approximately 18%, from $0.61 to $0.51, before recovery set in, and the price peaked at $0.60. The current price of Cardano is $0.59, and the overall rise over the past 24 hours is around 10%. The community sentiment is bullish, and many investors are taking it as an opportunity to buy the dip and pick up Cardano at this low price. Eventually, once the markets establish some normalcy, Cardano’s price is expected to cross over the $0.75 range at the least. IntelMarkets: AI-Powered High Trading ROIs While established coins like Cardano and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are gaining momentum from investors looking to pick up bargains while the market is low, the IntelMarkets presale is gaining momentum from investors attracted by its 400% gain potential at launch. The official listing will probably be by early Q3 and the INTL token is expected to list at $0.42. This will mean that current investors who buy INTL tokens at $0.09 in stage 10 will book 400% gains. This is an attractive ROI for any investment category. Combine this with IntelMarkets’ (INTL) strong utility proposition, which will increase its usage and adoption, and INTL investors have a strong upside proposition. As a trading platform that uses AI technology to offer users an easy-to-use, high-performing trading platform with features that ensure that any trade booked will be profitable, IntelMarkets offers users AI-powered trading bots and market analysis tools that yield clear and specific trading signals to ensure high-performing trades. Key Takeaway While Cardano and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are due to deliver high returns in the next 100 days as they perform well in rising markets, IntelMarkets is also due to deliver over 400% gains once it lists. This makes it a great pick to invest in, along with the Cardano and Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens in their current market lows.

The false report claimed that Nvidia was exploring ways to integrate Hedera’s technology for real-time verification of artificial intelligence-generated data. Investors reacted swiftly, pumping HBAR’s market capitalization by about $2 billion and pushing the value to approximately $6.99 billion on April 8. However, when it emerged that the news was fake, Hedera’s market cap dropped back to $6.03 billion, a loss of $960 million, before settling at around $6.31 billion at press time. HBAR one-day market cap chart. Source: CoinMarketCap The false claim was initially circulated via a LinkedIn post, which quickly raised several red flags. For instance, the LinkedIn account behind the post had only two prior entries, lacked any legitimate connection to Nvidia, and the employee mentioned in the publication could not be found in public records as being associated with the artificial intelligence giant. Additionally, neither Nvidia nor Hedera issued any official statement confirming the collaboration. HBAR price analysis As expected, the selling pressure has taken a toll on HBAR’s price, which is already in the midst of a broader market sell-off. At the time of reporting, the asset was valued at $0.1503, a decline of over 6% in the last 24 hours. On the weekly timeframe, Hedera has dropped 11%. HBAR one-week price chart. Source: Finbold According to its technical setup, which remains weak, Hedera’s sentiment is bearish. The price is below the 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) of $0.207583 and the 200-day SMA of $0.18421, suggesting downward momentum in both the short and long term. Lastly, the Fear & Greed Index is at 26, signaling fear, which often correlates with further downside or potential accumulation zones.

One Metric Thinks So",https://cryptonews.com/news/is-1000-the-final-floor-for-ethereum-one-metric-thinks-so/,"Ethereum has tumbled by 8% today, with its slide to $1,450 coming as the crypto market drops by 4% in the past 24 hours. These declines have come after President Trump increased tariffs against China to 104% yesterday, deepening the ongoing trade war between the US and much of the rest of the world. And in this context, Ethereum is looking increasingly weak, with the second-biggest coin in the market falling by 20% in a week, 29% in a month and 59% in a year. Some analysts are even suggesting that it drop as low as $1,000, even if its long-term price prediction remains as strong as ever. Is $1,000 the Final Floor for Ethereum? One Metric Thinks So Posting on X, Bloomberg analyst Mike McGlone suggested that Ethereum could be “the canary in the coal mine” for the rest of the market, with a potential fall to $1,000 likely signalling further losses for other assets. Falling #Ethereum Could Be the Canary In the Coal Mine – Ether may be on the way to revisiting its next round-number support level at $1,000, with implications for risk assets. Full report on Bloomberg here: https://t.co/vsuw0mMLAA {BI COMD} #commodities #gold #bitcoin … pic.twitter.com/61fhprgKPn — Mike McGlone (@mikemcglone11) April 6, 2025 Given that Ethereum’s momentum has completely fallen away in the past month or so, additional declines towards $1,000 are certainly possible, especially when China looks ready to respond assertively to Trump’s latest retaliatory tariffs. Yet ETH’s chart and indicators paint a picture in which the altcoin is at a bottom and should recover very soon, seeing as how oversold it is. Its one day-chart, for example, has its RSI (purple) at around 25, which is firmly in oversold territory. Likewise, its 30-day average (orange) has now fallen so far below the 200-day (blue) that a strong rebound should be on its way. Source: TradingView It’s a similar story with ETH’s one-week chart, although this suggests that we may have to wait a little longer for a final bottom. That’s because its weekly RSI is only just about to fall below 30, while its 30-week moving average hasn’t yet fallen below the 200-week average. And this chimes with the wider market picture, which has been deflated ever since US President Donald Trump has started on the tariff-related warpath. There’s some hope that the US will begin negotiating more pro-trade deals with various trading partners , something which could help to list Ethereum and other coins in the coming weeks.

However, as and when the overall picture improves, the coin will return to $2,000 in a short space of time, perhaps by June. Presale Coins Can Outperform Bear Markets Because Ethereum looks like it will have a difficult time for the next few weeks, many traders may be already shifting to newer tokens, which can often rally despite wider market conditions. One promising area for them may be presale tokens, with the biggest sales often leading to big exchange listings in due course.. And one of the biggest presales in recent memory belongs to Solaxy (SOLX), a new Solana-based project that has raised a very impressive $29.5 million in its ICO. Tomorrow's Tech.

It will also enable instant bridging between itself and Solana, as well as adding compatibility with other chains post-launch.

As such, it could enjoy massive demand, especially if Solaxy really takes off. Traders can join the SOLX presale by going to the Solaxy website , where the coin currently costs $0.001688. This price will continue to rise for as long as the sale lasts, so investors should move quickly if they want to make the biggest possible gains. The post Is $1,000 the Final Floor for Ethereum?

A single wallet burned over 17M SHIB, fueling most of the 34M tokens removed. RSI and MACD suggest weak momentum, with signs of possible trend reversal forming. Shiba Inu’s token burn activity spiked dramatically this week, with the rate increasing by over 1,500% in the past 24 hours, according to burn tracking data. During this period, more than 34 million SHIB tokens were permanently removed from circulation in an effort to reduce overall supply. Despite this deflationary action, the price of the meme coin remained under pressure, increasing investor concerns about whether supply adjustments alone can drive recovery during the wider market weakness. Where Did the SHIB Burns Come From? The bulk of the token burn came from a single wallet address, “0x541f60e5576,” which eliminated 17.13 million SHIB in one transaction. This pushed the day’s total burn count to over 34.2 million tokens.

Crypto exchanges are no longer just places to buy and sell cryptocurrencies. As trading volume remains volatile — sometimes swinging within hours — platforms like Kraken and Coinbase are turning to subscription models in search of more stable revenue. Over the years, crypto traders have seen exchanges roll out a wide range of services — from decentralized platforms and staking products to NFT marketplaces , lending features, and peer-to-peer tools. But most of them still rely on users deciding to trade on impulse, making revenues hard to predict. Rather than relying solely on transaction fees, exchanges are now exploring ways to create steadier income and offer a more consistent experience. Pauline Shangett, chief marketing officer at ChangeNOW , said in an interview with crypto.news that exchanges and similar services “are less in need of new revenue streams and more in need of stable and predictable ones.” “When all revenue depends on market turnover, which can plummet or surge dramatically based on news and circumstances, it complicates financial and strategic planning. For instance, not all exchanges survived past ‘crypto winters’ because they had expanded their staff and marketing budgets too aggressively without creating a financial safety net.” Pauline Shangett Shangett noted that subscription models and services whose demand doesn’t directly depend on the market’s phase “allow businesses to plan better for the future, engage in long-term projects with less risk, and ultimately provide a higher level of service to their customers.” “ChangeNOW and NOW Wallet also offer subscription options that provide more favorable terms, special offers, and access to additional services. For example, our subscribers can perform AML checks for free to verify their own and their counterparties’ addresses for any suspicious funds. Overall, yes, this model is beneficial both for the exchanges and their clients.” Pauline Shangett ‘Designed to offer real value’ Kraken is the latest to join the trend, introducing Kraken+, a premium membership that offers zero-fee trading and boosted rewards for $4.99 per month. According to a press release , Kraken+ lets users trade up to $10,000 per month fee-free on instant purchases through its main app. Subscribers also earn up to 4% APR on USDG held with the exchange. In an interview with crypto.news, Mark Greenberg, global head of consumer at Kraken, said that the launch of Kraken+ came as a “direct response to what we’ve heard from our clients.” “People want more utility from the platforms they trust. More ways to engage, save, and grow their holdings, without needing to jump through hoops. We built Kraken+ to reward that trust. For a small monthly fee, clients get meaningful everyday benefits like no-fee trading and stablecoin yield — all in a single, streamlined experience. It’s designed to offer real value from day one, and to keep getting better over time.” Mark Greenberg Technically speaking, Kraken follows in the footsteps of Coinbase, which launched a similar product in 2023. Coinbase One offers fee-free trading, priority support, and other perks — albeit at a significantly higher price point of $29.99 per month. A premium version, Coinbase One Premium, adds unlimited zero-fee trading, 25% back on Coinbase Advanced spot fees, and enhanced rewards, all for $299.99 per month.

In its February shareholder letter , the company said its subscription and services revenue reached $2.3 billion in 2024, up 64% year-over-year and more than four times higher than during the 2021 bull run. “Coinbase One subscribers grew in each quarter of 2024 as we expanded both account benefits and geographic availability throughout the year, which accelerated with the market momentum in Q4. Retention remains high, as subscribers tend to deepen their engagement on our platform across our product suite.” Coinbase Coinbase said that by the end of 2024, the number of Coinbase One subscribers even surpassed 600,000, up 50% from Q1 2024, fueled in part by a late-year surge in crypto markets that pushed Bitcoin past $90,000. Greenberg told crypto.news that Kraken expects “strong adoption” of its latest product and plans to expand it further in the future “It’s not just about what’s included at launch, but how we continue evolving it based on client feedback. Our goal is to make Kraken+ the most rewarding way to engage with crypto over the long term.” Mark Greenberg As competition among exchanges heats up, subscription products could represent a more sustainable path forward. Whether these programs will deliver lasting value for users and platforms alike remains to be seen. Still, Greenberg frames subscriptions as a question of trust, saying Kraken aims to build a platform “that people want to stay with not just for a product, but for the long-term journey.” Read more: Digital shift in Swiss economy shows ‘substantial opportunity’ for Swiss stablecoin, Bitcoin Suisse says",Feature|Exclusive|Coinbase|Exchange|Kraken|NFT|Staking,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|SPONSORED|TRADING,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-04-09 15:48:08

When investors hold one or more of their assets at a loss, they can sell the depreciated asset(s), realize the loss and use those realized losses to offset realized gains or ordinary income. Simultaneously, investors re-invest the proceeds from selling the depreciated assets to purchase similar assets (e.g., selling Home Depot stock and re-purchasing Lowe’s stock), thus also generally maintaining their original portfolio exposure. The outcome? Investors pay less in taxes at the end of the year while still maintaining their exposure — deferring near-term tax obligations and getting to keep more invested today for greater long-term compounded growth. Why automated? Software and algorithms are better suited to systematically exploit tax-loss harvesting (TLH) opportunities vs. manual human involvement. To effectively harvest losses, investors need to track their cost basis and purchase dates and perform the requisite trading across all of their holdings — all tasks that are more effectively handled by a mechanical process, especially when scaling up this technique for multi-asset portfolios with dozens of digital assets. When does TLH work best? TLH is a systematic technique that allows investors to get more from their holdings. Large, diversified liquid portfolios lend themselves well to this technique since investors can easily trade the underlying assets and replace assets with similar ones (ex: selling Coca-Cola stock and replacing it with Pepsi stock). The same is true for crypto markets — portfolios with dozens of digital assets generally have greater TLH flexibility compared to single-asset holdings or portfolios with only a small number of digital assets. In fact, this tax-savvy investing technique may work particularly well for crypto assets, which exhibit relatively higher volatility compared to other asset classes like equities and fixed income. While crypto’s volatility may deter some investors, TLH provides a silver lining. When doesn’t TLH work? Since TLH requires re-establishing one’s cost basis by selling and replacing individual assets, there are several investment choices that may not be as well-suited to TLH: Exchange-traded funds (ETFs). An ETF represents a single holding. If an investor purchases an S&P 500 ETF, for example, that holding either represents a loss or it doesn’t, and there is no flexibility to trade the underlying stocks. If an investor instead individually purchased all 500 stocks in the S&P 500 index, they can now enact a TLH program where they can sell certain assets and re-invest in similar ones. This is a meaningful drawback to current crypto ETFs, which face the additional problem of usually only being composed of a single asset and suffer from a lack of diversification . Single-asset investments (e.g., BTC or ETH only) or a small number of holdings (e.g., only 2-3 assets). In traditional markets, TLH can’t be used with single-asset holdings since there would be no “replacement” asset. The wash rule prevents investors in TradFi markets from selling and re-purchasing the same asset solely to claim a loss and achieve a tax deduction. Currently, however, the wash rule doesn’t exist for crypto. This absence is something crypto investors can therefore still exploit and still achieve TLH benefits with only one or a few assets, but this situation may not persist forever. More specifically, its absence is primarily the result of a lack of regulatory oversight and is not necessarily intentional. How do investors get started? Investors can use direct-index crypto separately managed accounts (SMAs) from crypto SMA managers to access liquid, actively managed multi-asset portfolios that encompass dozens of assets, rebalance automatically and perform automated TLH .",CoinDesk Indices|Crypto Taxes|taxes|CoinDesk Indices|Crypto Long & Short,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-09 15:49:33

While regulatory clarity will loom large over developments in the digital assets landscape in 2025 — investors in the survey called it the #1 catalyst for growth — the survey illustrated underlying enthusiasm and an appetite for innovation that will drive the market forward. Both institutional and retail investors are seeking new crypto-powered products and services to generate yield, provide access to credit and lending services, conduct cross-border payments, instantly clear transactions and grow long-term wealth.You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. As the ecosystem matures and continues to take shape, we will see traditional finance (TradFi) firms leverage decades of experience and reputations to securely offer new investment vehicles and products to clients. A friendlier regulatory backdrop will enable digital natives to innovate more quickly, pushing decentralized finance use cases forward by catering to both progressive clients and a new generation of financial customers. Investors want more digital assets and more options Of investors surveyed, 87% plan to increase overall allocations to crypto in 2025, spanning a variety of options such as exchange-traded products (ETPs), investments in digital asset companies, stablecoins, futures and thematic mutual funds. While many said they prefer to get their exposure to crypto through registered vehicles such as ETPs, there’s also interest in expanding custody services to offer and hold spot crypto directly. Per the survey, 55% hold spot crypto through ETPs, with 69% of those who plan to own spot crypto planning to do so using registered vehicles. Earlier in 2024, some of the bitcoin ETPs became the fastest growing ETPs across a spectrum of altcoins, including solana (SOL) and ripple (XRP). New innovation with stablecoins and tokenization Institutional investors look to opportunities to power new payment platforms and enjoy rewards through staking and yield generation. Eighty-four percent of investors surveyed said they are using or plan to use stablecoins, with Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) being the top two preferred coins. Stablecoins promise to make clearing instantaneous, modernizing and reducing risk in foreign currency exchange, cash management and a host of other use cases. Tokenization further promises to democratize access to investment options for the retail investor and provide new sources of capital for institutions. More than half of investors surveyed plan on investing in tokenized assets. The ability to diversify investments with a greater level of precision with fractional ownership and lower minimums will bring greater opportunities and improve risk management. At the top of investors' wish list for tokenization are alternative assets such as real estate, private equity, private credit and even commodities such as gold and oil. These are investments typically reserved for institutions or ultra high net worth clients, which through tokenization can be available to new retail investors. Innovation has always driven Wall Street forward. There is an expectation from investors that digital assets will not only move into the sphere of mainstream customer experience, but also provide new opportunities to participate in a growing decentralized financial system. Anchored with the backdrop of a friendlier regulatory stance on crypto in the U.S., investors globally expect new products and services to accelerate a renaissance in digital assets.

Maxine Waters took a shot at Trump’s numerous crypto ventures, accusing him of doubling his wealth at the expense of investors. Trump’s crypto ventures raise major concerns over corruption, Rep. Maxine Waters stated in a recent House hearing . On April 9, the Democratic congresswoman and House Financial Services Committee member accused Donald Trump of using crypto to enrich himself at the expense of investors and the public. Waters referenced his memecoin, the Official Trump token (TRUMP) , which has plunged 89.93% from its all-time high of $75.35 in January. According to Waters, this “fraudulent memecoin” was one of several ventures that helped Trump double his wealth through crypto. “President Trump has doubled his wealth, from $2.3 billion to $5.6 billion. His fraudulent memecoin lost investors $2 billion, while he and his family pocketed at least $350 million,” Waters stated. During the same hearing, Waters highlighted other Trump-affiliated crypto projects, including World Liberty Financial. She raised concerns about these ventures being used by foreign or domestic actors to influence U.S. policy. She said: “I am deeply concerned that these ventures have created an avenue for interested parties, whether they are allies or adversaries, to anonymously transfer money to him and his inner circle.” You might also like: Justin Sun invests $30m in Trump project World Liberty Financial Trump’s WLFI opens avenues for corruption: Waters Waters also criticized the subcommittee on digital assets, financial technology, and artificial intelligence, which held the hearing. She argued the committee was helping advance Trump’s crypto ambitions, stating: “This committee is helping Trump. Last week, this committee voted to make Trump the “king of crypto,” by passing legislation that lets him corner the market on stablecoins, kick George Washington off the dollar, and make his own stablecoin legal tender.” Waters referenced the recently announced WLFI stablecoin, USD1 . The stablecoin would be redeemable for the U.S. dollar, and backed by short-term U.S. Treasuries. Waters warned that the stablecoin could benefit from regulatory favoritism. Rep. Maxine Waters, together with Senator Elizabeth Warren, has been a longstanding critic of both Donald Trump and the deregulation of crypto assets. Both Waters and Warren demanded that all crypto legislation should pass checks on Trump’s potential conflict of interest.

Several major financial institutions, including BlackRock and Franklin Templeton, have made their mark in the world of tokenization and inspired others to follow the latest trend. For example, tokenized money market funds grew roughly 350% in a year to a market capitalization of $5.2 billion, per rwa.xyz data . ""When assessing tokenized funds, investors have to weigh not only the benefits of accessibility and transparency, but also the risks tied to the underlying technology, security vulnerabilities, scalability limitations and evolving regulations,” said Cristiano Ventricelli, VP-senior analyst at Moody’s Ratings. At the forefront of these risks is the limited experience of many fund managers in the still-developing tokenization market, Moody’s noted. With small teams and short track records, operators could face key-man risk where too much depends on a few individuals: If a crucial executive leaves or governance structures are thin, the stability of the fund could be shaken, the report said. Moody’s urged fund teams to distribute responsibilities and shore up risk management practices. Blockchain disruptions, again resulting from the novelty of the technology, poses another risk. While smart contracts offer operational efficiencies like automating fund operations, they remain susceptible to coding flaws or malicious attacks, the report noted. Using public, permissionless blockchains increases accessibility but also raises exposure to potential exploits, it added. Moody’s recommended keeping off-chain backups and conducting rigorous smart contract audits to guard against disruptions. Redemption mechanisms, which let investors cash out their holdings, are another fragile link. The report encouraged tokenized funds to allow redemptions in both stablecoins and fiat currency. This dual approach helps cushion against events like stablecoin depegs or blockchain outages. Lastly, tokenized funds operate across jurisdictions with varying regulations, and this patchwork increases the risk that investor claims could face legal hurdles, the report said. While some funds use structures designed to give token holders direct claims on the underlying assets, enforceability still depends on local laws and the strength of fund documentation, the report added.",Markets|Tokenization|Tokenized Assets|Real World Assets|Moody's,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-09 15:54:53

This capitulation from the ETH whale suggests it might be a good time to offload the leading altcoin, with a further crash in the coming weeks a possibility. Ethereum Whale Dumps 10,000 ETH After 900 Days In an X post, on-chain analytics platform Lookonchain revealed that an Ethereum whale finally capitulated after holding for over 900 days, selling all their 10,000 ETH for $15.71 million. This whale had originally bought 10,000 ETH for $12.95 million at an average price of $1,295 on October 4 and November 14, 2022. Related Reading: Ethereum Pain Is Far From Over: Why A Massive Drop To $1,400 Could Rock The Underperformer The Ethereum whale didn’t sell any of their ETH holdings, even when the leading altcoin broke through $4,000 twice in 2024. However, the whale has now capitulated with the Ethereum price below $1,500, nearing their average entry price of $1,295. The investor sold the coins for a $2.75 million profit, while their unrealized profit was $27.6 million at its peak. This Ethereum whale isn’t the only one who is capitulating. As Bitcoinist reported, ETH whales have dumped over 500,000 coins in the space of 48 hours. This development is thanks to Ethereum’s massive crash, with the leading altcoin at risk of dropping lower. This decline is part of a broader crypto market crash, which has occurred due to Donald Trump’s tariffs. Trump’s tariffs have led to a major trade war with China, which has promised not to back down, further sparking concerns among investors. As such, the Ethereum price looks more likely to suffer a further crash in the meantime, which explains why these Ethereum whales are capitulating to cut their losses. Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial Also Capitulating? Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial (WLFI), an Ethereum whale, looks to be feeling the heat and might have already started capitulating. Citing Arkham Intelligence’s data, Lookonchain revealed that a wallet possibly linked to WLFI sold 5,471 ETH for $8.01 million at the price of $1,465, representing a loss for the whale in question. Related Reading: From Solana To Ethereum? Donald Trump’s World Liberty Spends $20 Million On ETH World Liberty Financial had previously bought 67,498 ETH for $210 million at an average price of $3,259. The crypto firm is now sitting on an unrealized loss of $125 million, seeing as the Ethereum price has declined by over 50% since their purchases. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez predicts that the Ethereum price will crash further in the short term, indicating that Ethereum whales like WLFI could witness more unrealized loss on their ETH holdings. Martinez stated that $1,200 could be where the leading altcoin finds its footing. At the time of writing, the Ethereum price is trading at around $1,400, down over 8% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

In 2028, Ethereum is anticipated to trade between $14,697 and $17,549, with an average expected price of $10,507. In 2031, ETH could trade between $44,746 and $54,034 with an average price of $46,373 The Ethereum network, launched in 2015, is a decentralized platform that enables developers to create smart contracts and dApps without intermediaries, enhancing security. The Ethereum blockchain is accessible to everyone and built to support scalability, programmability, security, and decentralization, allowing for the creation of secure digital technology. Its native digital currency, ether (ETH), and smart contracts have attracted investors’ recognition and interest, while developers appreciate its utility in developing blockchain and decentralized finance applications. It also helps trades to trade Ethereum more easily So, what can traders and investors expect in the coming months and years? “Is ETH likely to go up? What will ETH be worth in 5 years?” Let’s get into the details by exploring Ethereum’s price predictions from 2025 through 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ethereum Token ETH Price $1,467 Market Cap $231.8B Trading Volume (24h) $8.69B Circulating Supply 120.6M ETH All-time High $4,891.70 on Nov 16, 2021 All-time Low $0.4209 on Oct 21, 2015 24-hour High $1,585.30 24-hour Low $1,386.80 Ethereum price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 6.76% 50-day SMA $ 2,321.49 200-day SMA $ 3,010 Sentiment Bearish Fear and Greed Index 26 (Fear) Green days 13/30 (43%) Ethereum price analysis ETH/USD 1-day chart ETH/USD 1-day chart Based on the 1-day chart on April 09, Ethereum (ETH) is exhibiting a persistent downtrend, with the current price slipping below the lower Bollinger Band, signaling possible oversold conditions. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 24.29, significantly below the neutral 50 mark, indicating heavy bearish momentum and potential exhaustion of selling pressure. Price action remains beneath both the 20-day and 50-day moving averages, affirming the dominance of sellers. However, such extreme RSI readings historically precede short-term rebounds or consolidation phases. Traders should watch for a bounce toward the $1,600–$1,700 range, although sustained recovery requires broader market support and improved sentiment. ETH/USD 4-hour chart analysis ETH/USD 4-hour price chart Based on the 4-hour chart, Ethereum (ETH) has shown a slight intraday bounce but remains under notable bearish pressure. Price action is trading below the 20-period moving average on the Bollinger Bands, suggesting that downward momentum persists. The MACD histogram is still in negative territory with the MACD line below the signal line, indicating continued bearish crossover. However, the Balance of Power (BoP) shows a mild positive reading at 0.11, hinting at some buyer interest. Unless ETH breaks and holds above the $1,550 resistance, short-term outlook remains bearish. Traders should monitor volatility and macroeconomic cues closely for direction. Ethereum technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 $ 2,425.03 SELL SMA 5 $ 2,281.72 SELL SMA 10 $ 2,213.94 SELL SMA 21 $ 2,056.70 SELL SMA 50 $ 2,321.49 SELL SMA 100 $2,781.05 SELL SMA 200 $ 3,010.36 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 $ 2,120.97 SELL EMA 5 $ 2,291.52 SELL EMA 10 $ 2,606.26 SELL EMA 21 $ 2,945.45 SELL EMA 50 $ 3,192.07 SELL EMA 100 $ 3,171.87 SELL EMA 200 $ 3,077.57 SELL What can you expect from ETH price analysis next? Based on both the 4-hour and 1-day charts, Ethereum (ETH) is displaying clear bearish signals with limited signs of reversal in the near term. On the 1-day chart, ETH trades well below the 20-day simple moving average, with Bollinger Bands widening downward, indicating increased volatility and downside pressure. The RSI is deeply oversold around 24, signaling weakness but also the potential for a relief bounce. On the 4-hour chart, the MACD remains negative and the price struggles to reclaim short-term resistance levels around $1,545. Unless ETH breaks above this threshold with strong volume, continued consolidation or downside remains likely. Is ETH a good investment? Ethereum is the largest DeFi hub with a vibrant layer-two ecosystem in the crypto market. The blockchain constantly develops, making it a go-to choice for many Web3 developers. ETH, its native token, shows promise, and the possibility of an Ethereum ETF approval makes it favorable for day traders. Over the long term, explore our price predictions. However, the opinions expressed are not investment advice; traders should consider researching before investing. What is a realistic price for Ethereum in 2025? The realistic price for Ethereum in 2025 is around $5,961 at the maximum. What will 1 Ethereum be worth in 2030? One Ethereum is expected to be worth $37,365 maximum in 2030. How high can ETH realistically go? Ethereum’s price potential depends on multiple factors, including market trends, institutional adoption, network upgrades, and macroeconomic conditions. Realistically, ETH could reach $5,000 to $7,000 in the next bullish cycle if demand increases and Ethereum’s Layer 2 solutions and scalability improvements boost adoption. If institutional interest strengthens, ETH may push past $10,000 over the long term, especially if Ethereum remains the dominant smart contract platform. However, volatility remains a key risk, with price corrections likely along the way. Regulatory clarity and Ethereum’s shift to proof-of-stake (PoS) efficiency could also positively influence its long-term valuation. Will ETH reach $10,000? Ethereum is projected to exceed $10,000 as early as 2027, with its potential low starting at $12,264 Will ETH reach $25,000? Ethereum is predicted to surpass the $25,000 level by 2029 and reach a potential high of $25,446. This optimistic outlook is based on Ethereum’s ongoing development, network security, and increasing adoption. However, cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, so long-term projections should be cautiously approached. Will ETH reach $40,000? Based on our analysis, Ethereum will likely reach the $40,000 mark. The highest expected price is around $54,034 in 2031. Does Ethereum have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but ETH is trading above its average price of the last two years. However, a positive outbreak can be expected. The ETH/USD pair is expected to reach the $54,034d mark by 2031, so holding it longer can be beneficial.

The bloc will decide on a return for the 25% tariffs on European steel and aluminum Trump imposed last month. Sweden’s trade minister, Benjamin Dousa, said that Brussels will also decide whether to get rid of its first retaliatory shot against U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs. He also noted that a qualified majority of member states would block the retaliation, which would take effect in three tranches in April, May, and December. Dousa believes the EU favors free trade EU flips from retaliation threats to offering 'zero-for-zero' tariffs with the US. Trump’s tariff pressure seems to be paying off-talks are back on the table. pic.twitter.com/QODuJWq2c4 — 𝐃𝐔𝐓𝐂𝐇 (@pr0ud_americans) April 7, 2025 Dousa maintained that the European Union favored free trade, including the commission’s proposal to the U.S. to mutually eliminate all tariffs on industrial goods. He said, “The U.S. is one of our closest friends in the world. We want more trade.” The politician argued that humankind has made the biggest leaps forward when goods, services, talents, entrepreneurs, and ideas move freely over the Atlantic. He also believes that a collaboration between Europe and the U.S. will allow new pharmaceuticals, more powerful robots, and exciting software. Dousa also highlighted the bloc’s assessment that the U.S. was not yet willing to negotiate about dropping its 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum, and cars, plus 20% on everything else. The minister also mentioned, “If we are forced to go forward with countermeasures, member states will support it.” The Bloc’s commissioner, Maros Sefcovic, revealed he will send his plans to retaliate against Trump’s so-called “reciprocal” tariffs early next week. EU considers using the ACI for the first time against Trump’s levies EU Loads the Bazooka: Trump’s Tariff Tantrums Won’t Work This Time🇪🇺 The EU is building a legal and economic “anti-Trump shield”, and this time, they’re not fucking around. They’ve learned from 2018–2020, when Trump’s trade war hit Europe almost as hard as China. And now?… pic.twitter.com/T0o7k8CTkI — Mario 🇺🇸🇵🇱🇺🇦🇪🇺 (@PawlowskiMario) April 8, 2025 Douglas also believes that countermeasures will be a lot longer if current tariff trends continue. He also argued whether the European Union should use its so-called Anti-Coercion Instrument (ACI) for the first time. ACI would allow the European Union to hit U.S tech firms from winning public procurement contracts. “When considering using ACI, we should be cautious. It is a broad instrument, and it has never been used before, so we have to analyze it carefully. But in principle, all options are on the table.” -Benjamin Dousa, Sweden’s trade minister. He also warned that if the European Union does not think it through and goes too fast, it could hurt the bloc more than it hurts the U.S. economy. A response from all the bloc’s trade ministers at their meeting in Luxembourg on Monday revealed that the European Union was negotiating with the ACI in its hands but still can’t agree on whether to pull the trigger just yet. The EU’s president, Ursula von der Leyen, maintained that the block first wanted to negotiate. She also added that the EU was offering a “zero-for-zero” tariffs scheme on industrial goods, covering cars, drugs, chemicals, plastics, and machinery, among other things. The ACI is a nuclear option that has yet to be deployed and would empower Leyen to hit U.S. service industries such as tech and banking. Leyen noted that Trump’s tariffs, which would affect 380 billion euros worth of EU exports, are the economic scenarios the EU had in mind when designing the ACI. Douglas said that just because Trump’s’ reciprocal tariffs of 20% on all European Union goods doesn’t mean the Block was ready to activate the ACI. He argued that doing so would mean the 27-nation bloc was really in a trade war. Spain’s economy minister, Carlos Cuerpo, said that the Anti-Coersion Instrument was there for them to use in case they find it necessary. He added that “we need to explore the use of all the instruments that are at our disposal. That’s for sure. We should not rule out anything.” The commission is also considering slapping tariffs of up to 25% on a broad range of exports from the U.S. in response to Trump’s levies on steel and aluminum. The bloc will vote on the plan on Wednesday. The vote would see the commission impose a 25% duty on a wide range of U.S. exports. Eurostat data showed that the total amount of U.S. exports affected would be 22.1B euros based on the EU’s 2024 imports.

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Bitcoin’s value struggled throughout February, enduring significant downturns. On February 27, the cryptocurrency dropped steeply, falling below $78,000 for the first time in more than three months. Analysis of on-chain data suggests that the decrease was largely driven by sell-offs from “Bitcoin tourists”—newcomers to the trading scene. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Ticker BTC Price $77,072 Market cap $1,538,914,422,643 Trading volume $55,318,495,561 Circulating supply 19,849,062 All-time high $108,268, December 17, 2024 All-time low $0.04865, Jul 15, 2010 24-hour high $80,315 24-hour low $74,589 Bitcoin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $77,072 Price Prediction $ 116,112 (38.22%) Fear & Greed Index 26 (Fear) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 2.97% Green Days 15/30 (50%) 50-Day SMA $ 89,357 200-Day SMA $ 84,704 14-Day RSI 45.26 Bitcoin price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: BTC price analysis shows that BTC price is facing strong bearish trend below $80K Resistance for BTC is at $81,107 Support for BTC/USD is at $74,221 The BTC price analysis for 9 April confirms that BTC faces a surge in buying demand as it triggers a recovery rally toward $80K. However, it soon faced strong selling pressure and dropped toward the low at around $75K. BTC price analysis 1-day chart: Bitcoin price faces increased volatility below $80K Analyzing the daily Bitcoin price chart, we see that BTC faced a buying demand toward the high of $80K. However, it failed to meet buyers’ demand near higher levels and triggered a decline later toward $75K. The 24-hour volume has surged to $3.34 billion, showing a surge in trading interest today. BTC is trading at $77,072, declining by over 3% in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin shows volatility The RSI-14 trend line has dropped from its previous level and trades around the selling region at 36, hinting that bearish pressure is on the edge. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. BTC/USD 4-hour price chart: Bulls aim for an immediate correction The 4-hour Bitcoin price chart suggests that bears are strengthening their position to hold the price below the EMA trend lines. However, bulls maintain buying confidence as the BTC price corrects upwards. Bitcoin aims for immediate correction The BoP indicator trades in a bullish region at 0.87, showing that short-term buyers are taking a chance to accelerate an upward trend. However, the MACD trend line has formed red candles below the signal line, and the indicator aims for negative momentum, strengthening short-position holders’ confidence.

The hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin is attempting to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a recovery rally in the coming hours. If BTC’s price holds momentum above $81,107, it will fuel a bullish rally to $84,910. BTC Price Chart If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $74,221, beginning a bearish trend to $70,213. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin makes it a good investment option. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile prices. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Why is Bitcoin down today? Bears gained control after Bitcoin failed to move above $80K. This triggered a bearish decline toward $75K. Will Bitcoin Price Recover? If buyers successfully defend the $75K bearish level, they might aim for another surge toward $80K. We might see a strong recovery if Bitcoin maintains that level. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price recently broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, forming a new ATH. The price currently aims to maintain its buying demand above $100K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. are set to expand the Trump family’s cryptocurrency business portfolio by investing in Bitcoin mining-focused Hut 8. Hut 8, based in Miami, announced the launch of its majority-owned subsidiary, American Bitcoin, dedicated to Bitcoin mining and strategic reserve development. Bitcoin price prediction April 2025 Bitcoin’s Q1 2025 performance is notably weak, with a 12.5% loss, as per CoinGlass data, marking the worst first quarter since 2018. Will the BTC price recover in April 2025? Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $89,000 and be pushed further, at least $95,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $72,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction April 2025 $72,000 $89,000 $95,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Bitcoin spot ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF demand might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026. Bitcoin price prediction 2027 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491.

Cathie Wood of Ark Invest forecasts Bitcoin may hit $600,000 by 2030, with a potential rise to $1.5 million in her bull case scenario after Bitcoin ETF approval. Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $95,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. We expect Bitcoin price to reach a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history | Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October.

BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20.

As the tariff war continues and people wonder whether the FED will cut interest rates in May, Minneapolis FED President Neel Kashkari explained how tariffs affect the FED's decision and the inflation situation. Kashkari said the Fed is less likely to cut interest rates in the face of tariffs, given the inflationary effects of tariffs. Kashkari called President Donald Trump’s tariff decision “much higher and broader than expected.” The Fed official added that he predicted the tariffs would reduce investment and economic growth and increase inflation “at least in the near term.” The highlights of Kashkari's statement were as follows: “The obstacles to changing the policy rate have increased due to tariffs. Even as the economy and labor market weaken, the bar is higher and there is time to cut interest rates. Any upward or downward reaction of monetary policy should not be ignored. Ignoring inflationary effects of tariffs is “too risky.” The first priority should be to keep long-term inflation expectations stable. In the short term, inflation will rise, purchasing power will decline, investment will probably fall and GDP will shrink due to tariffs. The announced tariffs are much higher and more comprehensive than expected, leading to a greater economic impact and confidence shock. Monetary policy is tightening on its own, reducing the need for immediate rate hikes. If the uncertainty is quickly cleared, I can reconsider my perspective. Keeping long-term inflation expectations stable should be the first priority.” The FED keeping interest rates constant in May is priced at 58.5%, while a 25 basis point cut is priced at 41.5%. *This is not investment advice.

43132047,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=707398,1744219800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/43132047.jpeg,Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Price Prediction: A Detailed Examination Of Its Growth Potential,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/mutuum-finance-mutm-price-prediction-a-detailed-examination-of-its-growth-potential/,"Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly capturing the attention of investors, with its presale passing $6.5 million, and over 395 million tokens sold. Already 8,100 holders have signed up, reflecting healthy market confidence, and the project is currently in phase 4 out of a total 11 stages in its presale. The current price of the token is $0.025 but will increase by 20% in the next phase, reaching $0.03. This generated solid demand from the early buyers and it is estimated to be around 140% profit at the launch itself where the expected listing of MUTM is $0.06. The upside beyond that is even more alluring, with price targets post launch ranging upwards of $5, making this one of the best opportunity’s currently in DeFi. Presale Phase 4 Momentum Rising Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has now entered its 4th presale phase and offers tokens for $0.025 — a price that surely won’t last for too long. From the start of Phase 5, the price per token rises to $0.03, giving early purchasers a 20% instant paper profit. With each increasing phase being priced slightly higher, the presale mechanism ensures those who buy early are rewarded. For new participants, this means buying in at a bottom price (the lowest ever before exchange listings) — where actual demand will be thrusted through the roof. The project’s quick success in raising funds speaks to its appeal. The rapid $6.5 million fundraising in less than a month shows excellent market confidence, and with only seven more phases left to go, the time for users to buy MUTM at a discount is quickly running out. In this sense, the team employs the strategic pricing model that guarantees a consistent upward momentum, allowing for little to no volatility, while also maximizing the gains for earlier backers. Tokenomics Driving Surging ROI MUTM tokenomics are built for constant growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn’t like your average store of value or speculative asset. The $0.06 listing price is a 140% increase over the existing Phase 4 price, yet the genuine profitable opportunity exists after that. With post-launch projections estimating MUTM upwards of $3, Phase 4 investors could potentially experience crazy returns of 11,900%! Central to this growth is the project’s buy-and-distribute mechanic which allocates platform revenue to repurchasing MUTM tokens. This results in constant buying pressure and less selling to be distributed to the stakers. When paired with its lending and borrowing utilities, Mutuum Finance boasts long-term, sustainable demand which differentiates it from meme coins and other flash-in-the-pan DeFi fads. Security and Roadmap for the Future Mutuum Finance isn’t cutting corners on trust. Developer team is already working on Certik audit for its smart contracts, which will boost the investor’s confidence. After the audit is complete, the results will be announced publicly, cementing the project’s commitment to transparency. In the future, the platform will launch an overcolateralized stablecoin, leading to deeper DeFi integration. Combined with peer-to-peer lending and, soon, dynamic interest rates, this makes MUTM a multi-faceted financial instrument rather than just a speculative asset. Now Is the Key Entry Point As Phase 4 fills at a rapid velocity, a few moments of indecision could cost you the lowest price another trip over surge pricing. It’s a simple equation — buying in at $0.025 today will assure you a 20% profit once Phase 5 starts, then a 140% ROI at launch. After listing, the upside can be exponential with conservative estimates still predicting multi-dollar valuations. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not merely a vessel for market hype; it’s designed for real-world functionality and lasting demand. This makes the presale a rare opportunity for investors looking for a high-growth asset with real use cases.

The company that lets users bet on events ranging from election outcomes to Rotten Tomatoes film ratings has seen a strong uptake among crypto traders, Kalshi told Cointelegraph on April 9. For instance, event contracts for betting on Bitcoin’s hour-by-hour price changes have seen $143 million in trading volume to date, a spokesperson said. Kalshi is a derivatives exchange regulated by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). As of April 9, it listed some 50 crypto-related event contracts, including markets for betting on coins’ 2025 highs and lows, as well as on headlines such as US President Donald Trump’s proposed National Bitcoin Reserve. Kalshi has doubled down on crypto event contract markets. Source: Kalshi The platform started accepting crypto payments in October when it enabled stablecoin USD Coin ( USDC ) deposits. Kalshi relies on ZeroHash — a crypto payments infrastructure provider — for off-ramping BTC and USDC and converting the deposits to US dollars. The exchange accepts BTC deposits only from the Bitcoin network. Most Kalshi traders no longer expect core tokens to earn positive returns this year. Source: Kalshi Related: Kalshi traders place the odds of US recession in 2025 at over 61% More accurate than polls Launched in 2021, Kalshi rose to prominence ahead of the US’s November elections . It became a top venue for trading on 2024 political events after winning a lawsuit against the CFTC, which tried to block Kalshi from listing contracts tied to elections. The regulator argued that political prediction markets threaten the integrity of elections, but industry analysts say they often capture public sentiment more accurately than polls . For instance, prediction markets, including Kalshi, accurately predicted Trump’s presidential election win even as polls indicated a tossup. “Event contract markets are a valuable public good for which there is no evidence of significant manipulation or widespread use for any nefarious purposes that the Commission alleges,” Harry Crane, a statistics professor at Rutgers University, said in an August comment letter filed with the CFTC. As of April 9, Kalshi traders peg the odds of the US entering a recession at 68%, according to its website. In March, Kalshi partnered with Robinhood to bring prediction markets to the popular online brokerage platform. Robinhood’s stock rose some 8% on the news . Kalshi competes with Polymarket, a Web3-based prediction platform. Polymarket processed more than $3 billion in trading volumes tied to the US presidential election despite being off-limits for US traders.

President Javier Milei, known for his pro-crypto stance, is now under the microscope. The Argentine lower house of parliament has given the nod to an investigation probing his alleged connections to the controversial Libra (LIBRA) memecoin. Let’s dive into what this shocking development means for Argentina and the broader crypto landscape. Unpacking the Libra Crypto Scandal : What’s the Fuss About? For those just catching up, the core of the issue revolves around a memecoin named LIBRA. Yes, you read that right – not to be confused with Meta’s (formerly Facebook) Libra project of the past. This LIBRA is a completely different entity, a memecoin that gained traction, and subsequently, controversy. President Milei, a vocal advocate for digital currencies, publicly promoted this memecoin in a post on X (formerly Twitter) on February 14th. This promotion is now the epicenter of the Libra crypto scandal . Key Points to Understand: Presidential Promotion: Javier Milei, the President of Argentina, promoted the LIBRA memecoin on social media. Fraud Accusations: Following his promotion, accusations of fraud surfaced, alleging that Milei lured investors into a potentially risky or deceptive scheme. Parliamentary Probe: Argentina’s lower house has now voted to support an official investigation into these allegations. Senate Rejection: Interestingly, a similar proposal was previously rejected by the Argentine Senate, highlighting a division in the political response. Why is Javier Milei Under Investigation? The central question is: why is President Milei being investigated in connection with a memecoin? Critics argue that by publicly endorsing LIBRA, President Milei may have used his position to influence investment decisions, potentially misleading Argentinians. The investigation aims to determine the extent of his involvement and whether his actions constitute any wrongdoing. This situation raises serious questions about the ethical boundaries of political figures promoting financial assets, especially in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. Argentina Crypto Scene and the Political Fallout Argentina has a burgeoning cryptocurrency scene, fueled in part by economic instability and a desire for alternatives to traditional financial systems. Against this backdrop, the Argentina crypto community is closely watching the unfolding situation. This scandal could have significant ramifications for the perception of cryptocurrencies in Argentina and potentially influence future regulations. Potential Impacts on Argentina’s Crypto Landscape: Regulatory Scrutiny: The scandal may intensify calls for stricter regulation of the crypto market in Argentina. Investor Confidence: It could erode investor confidence, particularly if the investigation uncovers unethical practices. Political Polarization: The issue is already politically charged, evident from the differing votes in the lower house and Senate. This could further polarize the political landscape around crypto policy. Crypto Investigation : What Happens Next? With the lower house backing the proposal, the crypto investigation is set to move forward. While the specifics of the investigation are still emerging, it’s likely to involve: Gathering Evidence: Investigators will likely collect information related to President Milei’s promotion of LIBRA, including social media posts, communications, and any potential financial connections. Witness Testimony: Individuals involved in the LIBRA memecoin project, as well as those who invested based on Milei’s endorsement, may be called to testify. Legal Analysis: Legal experts will assess whether Milei’s actions violated any laws or ethical standards. Report and Recommendations: The investigation will likely culminate in a report outlining the findings and potentially recommending further actions. It’s crucial to remember that this is just the beginning of the investigation process. The outcome remains uncertain, and President Milei has not yet been found guilty of any wrongdoing. However, the fact that the lower house has approved this probe signals the seriousness with which Argentine lawmakers are treating these allegations. Memecoin Fraud and Investor Beware The LIBRA saga also serves as a stark reminder of the risks associated with memecoins and the potential for memecoin fraud . Memecoins, often characterized by their internet meme origins and lack of intrinsic value, can be highly volatile and susceptible to pump-and-dump schemes. Investors, especially newcomers to the crypto space, need to exercise extreme caution when dealing with memecoins. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors: Due Diligence is Key: Thoroughly research any cryptocurrency before investing, especially memecoins. Understand the project’s fundamentals (or lack thereof). Be Wary of Hype: Be skeptical of celebrity or influencer endorsements, particularly in the crypto world. Do your own independent research. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Memecoins are high-risk assets. Seek Reputable Sources: Rely on credible news sources and financial advisors for crypto information, not just social media hype. Conclusion: A Crypto Controversy Unfolds The investigation into President Milei’s alleged involvement in the Libra memecoin situation is a significant development in the crypto world and Argentine politics. It underscores the growing intersection of cryptocurrency and political influence, while also highlighting the inherent risks within the memecoin market.

A major showdown is brewing in the PancakeSwap ecosystem. Cakepie, a significant sub-DAO within PancakeSwap, has thrown down the gauntlet, vehemently opposing PancakeSwap’s latest Tokenomics Proposal 3.0. The heart of the contention? PancakeSwap’s plan to scrap veCAKE, a move Cakepie argues could send ripples of disruption across the entire platform and beyond. Is this a necessary evolution or a misstep that could fracture community trust? Let’s dive into the details of this developing DeFi drama. Why is veCAKE Removal Causing Such a Stir in the PancakeSwap Community? For those unfamiliar, veCAKE (voting-escrowed CAKE) is more than just a token; it’s the linchpin of PancakeSwap’s governance and incentive structure. By locking up their CAKE tokens, users receive veCAKE, granting them voting rights in governance decisions and boosted yields in various PancakeSwap farms and pools. This mechanism has been instrumental in fostering long-term commitment and active participation within the PancakeSwap ecosystem. Cakepie’s opposition isn’t just a knee-jerk reaction; it’s a calculated response rooted in concerns about the potential fallout from dismantling the veCAKE system. They argue that removing veCAKE could unravel the intricate web of incentives and governance that has made PancakeSwap a leading decentralized exchange (DEX). Let’s break down Cakepie’s core arguments: Erosion of Trust: Cakepie warns that abruptly discarding veCAKE could severely damage the trust projects and users have placed in PancakeSwap . Many projects have built their strategies and integrations around the existence of veCAKE, and suddenly changing the rules of the game could be perceived as a betrayal of confidence. Reduced Incentives: veCAKE serves as a powerful incentive for long-term CAKE holders. Its removal could diminish the appeal of holding CAKE, potentially leading to decreased staking and reduced liquidity within the PancakeSwap ecosystem. The boosted yields associated with veCAKE are a significant draw for many users. Governance Distortion: Without veCAKE, the governance structure of PancakeSwap could become vulnerable to manipulation or less representative of the community’s long-term interests. veCAKE ensures that those with a longer-term stake in the platform have a greater say in its direction. Cakepie’s Urgent Plea: Alternatives to Scrapping veCAKE Instead of simply criticizing the proposal, Cakepie has stepped up to offer constructive alternatives. Their approach is not to block progress but to steer PancakeSwap towards a solution that addresses the underlying concerns without sacrificing the benefits of veCAKE. What are these alternatives? Cakepie proposes exploring modifications and improvements to the existing veCAKE model rather than outright elimination. These could include: Refining veCAKE Mechanics: Instead of removal, PancakeSwap could consider tweaking the veCAKE tokenomics to address any perceived shortcomings. This might involve adjusting lock-up periods, voting power distribution, or reward mechanisms to better align with current platform goals. Introducing New Features: Cakepie suggests exploring ways to enhance veCAKE’s utility and integration within the PancakeSwap ecosystem. This could involve adding new functionalities or expanding its role in different aspects of the platform to make it even more valuable. Gradual Transition: If significant changes are deemed necessary, Cakepie advocates for a phased transition rather than an abrupt cut-off. This would provide projects and users with ample time to adapt and adjust their strategies, minimizing disruption and maintaining trust. The Stakes are High: What’s at Risk with the Tokenomics Proposal 3.0? The outcome of this debate surrounding Tokenomics Proposal 3.0 has significant implications for the future of PancakeSwap . It’s not just about veCAKE; it’s about the fundamental principles of DeFi governance, community trust, and sustainable growth. Potential Challenges of Removing veCAKE: Challenge Description Decreased User Engagement Without the incentives of veCAKE, active participation in governance and staking might decline. Project Exodus Projects relying on veCAKE might seek platforms with more stable and predictable tokenomics. Centralization Risks A shift away from veCAKE could inadvertently lead to more centralized governance if alternative mechanisms are not carefully designed. Market Perception Abrupt changes to core tokenomics can negatively impact market sentiment and investor confidence in PancakeSwap . Potential Benefits of Re-evaluating veCAKE (PancakeSwap’s Perspective – implied): Potential Benefit Description Streamlined Tokenomics PancakeSwap might believe that simplifying the tokenomics by removing veCAKE could make the system more efficient or easier to manage. New Incentive Mechanisms The proposal likely includes plans for alternative incentive structures that PancakeSwap believes will be more effective in the long run. Adaptability Removing veCAKE could be seen as a move to adapt to the evolving DeFi landscape and implement more modern or flexible governance models. DeFi Governance in Action: A Case Study in Community Alignment This situation with Cakepie and PancakeSwap highlights the crucial role of DeFi Governance in decentralized platforms. It’s a real-world example of how sub-DAOs and community stakeholders can actively participate in shaping the future of a protocol. Cakepie’s proactive response demonstrates the power of community voices in holding platforms accountable and advocating for solutions that prioritize long-term alignment. The ongoing discussion is a testament to the decentralized ethos of cryptocurrency, where decisions are not made in a vacuum but are subject to scrutiny and debate within the community. Whether PancakeSwap will heed Cakepie’s warnings and explore alternative paths remains to be seen. However, the dialogue itself is a positive sign, indicating a vibrant and engaged community that cares deeply about the platform’s trajectory. Actionable Insights: What Can We Learn from this DeFi Debate? For participants in the DeFi space, this situation offers several valuable takeaways: Stay Informed: Actively follow governance proposals and discussions within the platforms you use. Your voice matters, and participation is key to shaping the future of DeFi. Understand Tokenomics: Take the time to understand the tokenomics models of the protocols you interact with, especially governance tokens and incentive mechanisms like veCAKE. Engage Constructively: When you have concerns or suggestions, engage in constructive dialogue with the community and platform developers. Like Cakepie, offering well-reasoned alternatives is more impactful than simply criticizing. Community Power: Recognize the power of collective action within DeFi communities. Cakepie’s organized response shows how sub-DAOs and community groups can influence platform decisions. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for PancakeSwap and DeFi Evolution The standoff between Cakepie and PancakeSwap over the veCAKE removal is more than just a disagreement about tokenomics. It’s a pivotal moment that will test the resilience of PancakeSwap’s community and its commitment to decentralized governance. The outcome will not only shape the future of PancakeSwap but also provide valuable lessons for the broader DeFi space on how to navigate complex tokenomic decisions while preserving community trust and fostering sustainable growth. Keep a close watch on this developing story – it’s a crucial chapter in the ongoing evolution of decentralized finance.

Trump’s surprise move came after four days of market volatility triggered by uncertainty over U.S. trade policy. Earlier this week, stocks saw its worst multi-day performance since the Great Financial Crisis as investors weighed the possibility of global recession risks tied to escalating tariffs. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced he would take the lead in upcoming tariff negotiations. Wall Street sees Bessent’s involvement as a stabilizing factor, favoring his moderate approach over the more hawkish stances of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and trade advisor Peter Navarro.

The yield climbed to 4.36% , reportedly jumping significantly in just two days to reach its highest level in over a month. The spike suggests increased borrowing costs and growing investor unease regarding inflation and the large supply of government debt hitting the market. Why Are Yields Suddenly Rising? The yield surge also marks a shift in investor sentiment after weeks of relative calm in the bond market.

Tron historic price sentiment TRON price history Tron, founded by Justin Sun in 2017, raised $70 million through an ICO the same year; it launched its mainnet in May 2018 and migrated TRX from Ethereum to Tron in June, which temporarily boosted TRX’s price to $0.09. TRX reached an all-time high of $0.3004 in January 2018 before dropping below $0.05 a month later; it consistently traded under $0.05 until late 2020, when it began to rise again. In 2021, it reached a high of $0.16. Tron was also reorganized as a DAO as Justin stepped down as CEO of Tron Foundation. TRX was in a bear trend for the best part of 2022. In 2023, TRX maintained a consistent bull run, rising from a low of $0.05. In March 2023, the SEC sued Justin for allegedly selling unregistered securities and promoting Tron and Bittorent tokens. In February 2024, Circle’s announcement to cease USDC on Tron led TRX to correct from $0.1429. TRX held above $0.1234 until mid-May, then dropped to $0.1113. The price rebounded to $0.1398 in July but fell again to $0.1213 in early August. By late September, TRX recovered to $0.166, reaching $0.1691 in October and touching $0.2130 in late November. TRX ended 2024 with a price tag of $0.255. Tron was priced at $0.255 at the start of January 2025 and it was trading in a range of $0.204 to $0.257 in February. In March 2025, Tron (TRX) dipped to $0.212, but it recovered to the $0.23 range in April.",Crypto Price Predictions|TRON,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|ICO|LINK|MARKET|TRADING|TRX|USDT|BNB|USDD,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-04-09 17:48:11

The financial world is witnessing a seismic shift as the Chinese yuan has plummeted to its weakest level since 2007. This isn’t just another blip on the radar; it’s a major economic tremor with potentially huge aftershocks for global markets, and yes, even the crypto sphere. Are you prepared for the ripple effects of this yuan devaluation ? Unpacking the China Yuan Weakness: What’s Driving the Downturn? The headlines scream China yuan weakness , but what’s really happening? Imagine a tug-of-war between economic forces. On one side, you have China’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), seemingly allowing the yuan to weaken. On the other, global market pressures are intensifying, fueled by an escalating trade war. Let’s break down the key factors contributing to this dramatic currency slide: Escalating Trade Tensions: The ongoing trade friction, particularly with the United States, casts a long shadow over China’s economic outlook. Tariffs, export controls, and geopolitical uncertainties are all weighing heavily on investor sentiment. Economic Slowdown in China: Post-pandemic recovery in China hasn’t been as robust as many anticipated. Concerns are mounting about the property sector, local government debt, and overall economic momentum. This perceived slowdown weakens the yuan’s appeal. Interest Rate Divergence: The US Federal Reserve has been aggressively raising interest rates to combat inflation, making the dollar more attractive to investors. In contrast, China has maintained a relatively accommodative monetary policy, further widening the interest rate gap and putting downward pressure on the yuan. Capital Outflows: As the yuan weakens and economic uncertainties linger, there’s a risk of capital flowing out of China in search of safer or higher-yielding assets elsewhere. This outflow further exacerbates the yuan devaluation . The Domino Effect: Trade War Impact and Global Currency Markets The weakening yuan isn’t an isolated event; it’s a significant piece in the complex puzzle of global currency markets . When the world’s second-largest economy’s currency takes a hit, shockwaves are felt across the globe. Here’s how the trade war impact and currency dynamics are intertwined: Impact Area Description Competitive Devaluation Concerns Other countries, particularly in Asia, might feel pressure to devalue their currencies to remain competitive with Chinese exports. This could trigger a currency devaluation spiral. Emerging Market Volatility Emerging markets with strong trade ties to China could face increased financial instability as their currencies and economies are affected by China’s slowdown and currency fluctuations. Commodity Price Fluctuations A weaker yuan can make Chinese imports cheaper, potentially impacting global commodity prices. Conversely, it can make Chinese exports more competitive, affecting global trade balances. Dollar Strength As investors seek safe havens, the US dollar tends to strengthen during periods of global economic uncertainty. The yuan’s weakness reinforces this dollar strength. Crypto Market Reaction: A Safe Haven or Just Another Ripple? Now, let’s talk crypto. How does the crypto market reaction to all this currency turmoil? Historically, in times of economic uncertainty and currency devaluations, some investors have turned to cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, as a potential hedge. Is this time different? Here’s a balanced perspective: Potential Safe Haven Appeal: In theory, Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and limited supply could make it attractive as an alternative store of value when fiat currencies like the yuan face devaluation. Some investors might see it as a way to protect their wealth from currency risks. Correlation with Risk Assets: In recent times, crypto markets have shown a higher correlation with traditional risk assets like equities. If the yuan’s weakness triggers broader market downturns, crypto might also experience downward pressure, at least in the short term. Geopolitical Uncertainty and Crypto Adoption: Escalating trade wars and geopolitical tensions can sometimes accelerate the adoption of decentralized technologies like cryptocurrencies, as people seek alternatives to traditional financial systems. China’s Crypto Stance: It’s crucial to remember China’s regulatory stance on cryptocurrencies. While the yuan’s weakness might theoretically boost crypto appeal, China’s strict crypto regulations could limit any direct impact within China itself. Navigating the Yuan’s Weakness: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what should crypto investors do amidst this China yuan weakness and global economic uncertainty? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on developments in the yuan’s exchange rate, trade war news, and global economic indicators. Information is your best tool in volatile times. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification across different asset classes, including crypto, can help mitigate risks. Risk Management is Key: Understand your risk tolerance and manage your portfolio accordingly. Volatility is inherent in crypto markets, and economic uncertainty can amplify it. Long-Term Perspective: Avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term market fluctuations. Focus on the long-term fundamentals of your crypto investments. Explore Stablecoins (with Caution): In times of currency volatility, some investors might consider stablecoins pegged to stronger currencies like the US dollar. However, always research the stability and reserves of any stablecoin before investing. Conclusion: A World on Edge – The Yuan and the Crypto Crossroads The yuan devaluation to its weakest level in 16 years is a stark reminder of the interconnectedness of the global economy and the ever-present undercurrents of geopolitical tension. For the crypto world, it presents both potential opportunities and challenges. While the narrative of crypto as a safe haven might gain traction, the reality is more nuanced. The crypto market reaction will likely be influenced by a complex interplay of factors, including broader market sentiment, risk appetite, and regulatory developments. One thing is certain: these are turbulent times, and staying informed, adaptable, and prepared is paramount for navigating the choppy waters ahead.

Bitcoin is trading at $81,636 up 5.6% in 24 hours following the announcement. In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump declared that tariffs on Chinese imports would rise to 125% effective immediately, citing what he described as China’s lack of respect for global markets. “China has been taking advantage of the United States and other nations for too long,” Trump wrote. “The days of ripping off the U.S.A. are over.” 90-Day Pause on New Tariffs for Other Countries, Says Trump At the same time, Trump revealed a 90-day pause on new tariffs for other countries, stating that more than 75 nations have engaged with U.S. trade officials to negotiate on issues such as trade barriers, currency manipulation, and non-monetary tariffs. As a result, he has authorized a reduced reciprocal tariff of 10% for those countries during the pause period. Trump Triggers Market Rally Markets appeared to rally on the news, with the S&P 500 jumping over 5.5% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq soaring over 8%. Investors seemed encouraged by the temporary easing of global trade tensions, despite the dramatic hike in tariffs against China. It remains unclear whether any countries beyond China will face higher-than-10% tariffs once the 90-day pause expires. Trump’s message did not specify further details or potential next steps, though the implication is that trade partners who avoid retaliation and continue negotiations may avoid harsher measures. The move is seen as a high-stakes gamble by Trump to pressure Beijing while maintaining stability with other key trading partners. With markets reacting positively for now, attention will likely shift to how China responds and whether the 90-day window leads to any breakthroughs.

Earlier today, on-chain analyst Lookonchain revealed that the financial giant sold a massive 3,296 Bitcoin, worth about $254 million, on Coinbase. This move has raised many concerns in the market, as people are worried about what this could mean for Bitcoin’s price. While BlackRock’s move might seem like a bearish signal, the sell-off move has an underlying reason. Why People Are Worried About BlackRock’s Bitcoin Sale In the crypto industry, when large amounts of Bitcoin or other digital currencies are moved to exchanges like Coinbase, it is often seen as a sign that the holder plans to sell. This makes market participants nervous. Even though this latest move might not necessarily mean that BlackRock is abandoning Bitcoin, the action still raised alarms. This is especially because BlackRock is such a big player in the financial world. BlackRock Bitcoin ETF and the Sale The reason behind this Bitcoin sale is linked to BlackRock’s IBIT, the world’s largest Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). There have been massive outflows from IBIT recently , as investors are aggressively pulling capital out of the fund. Experts believe these massive withdrawals are likely causing the sale of Bitcoin, not because BlackRock is selling off its BTC holdings. Even though BlackRock still holds 572,074 BTC, worth about $44.89 billion, the outflows from IBIT might be driving the sale. Although IBIT does not directly hold Bitcoin, BlackRock’s actions still greatly influence the market. This shows how connected traditional finance is to the world of cryptocurrency. This sell-off can lead to crypto price changes and market uncertainty, especially in the United States, which is experiencing an economic crisis. Bitcoin Remains A Dominant Force Despite Volatility Bitcoin (BTC) began in 2025 at $94,443.52. As of today, it has fallen to $77,726.12, up by 0.11% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. Despite the dip, Bitcoin continues to lead the market with a valuation above $1.54 trillion, securing its spot as the top cryptocurrency. This recent decline is largely tied to market uncertainty, including new U.S. tariffs introduced earlier in the year, which rattled investor sentiment. Despite the pullback, Bitcoin maintains its reputation as a store of value. Institutional interest has not faded. Many experts view this as a natural correction rather than a cause for concern. Given Bitcoin’s track record of bouncing back from similar declines, long-term holders remain confident.

Knowing which cryptocurrencies are poised for a rebound can turn a dip into a profitable venture. This article explores top digital assets likely to surge after a downturn, providing insight into potential gains as the market recovers. Discover the best crypto picks ready to rise from the ashes. Bitcoin Price Swing: Short-Term Dip Amid Six-Month Strength Bitcoin experienced a one-month decline of about 5.2%, countered by a strong six-month gain of approximately 26.9%. This recent drop highlights temporary pullback forces while an overall upward trend has persisted for half a year. Despite the volatility, this minor setback has not significantly hindered the solid recovery seen in the mid-term. The current trading range is between roughly $73,940 and $93,783, with key support at about $65,370 and resistance near $105,055. Short-term movements are currently influenced by bearish pressures, as momentum indicators trend lower and the RSI is around 34.6. A sideways market trend indicates that traders should anticipate stabilization near support before making decisions on breaking through resistance levels. TRON Shows Resilience Amid Recent Market Pullback A 2.17% dip over the past month contrasts with a robust 42.95% increase over the last six months. Price action reflects a strong recovery over a longer horizon despite a minor recent pullback. The asset’s performance demonstrates resilience, as long-term gains outweigh short-term volatility, indicating that TRON has held its ground while adjusting to market corrections. Current trading occurs within a range of $0.22 and $0.26, with key levels set at $0.27 resistance and $0.19 support, while secondary levels are at $0.31 resistance and $0.15 support. Recent oscillator readings and a near-neutral RSI reveal a slight bearish pressure amid sideways movement. Traders might consider exploring positions between these levels, watching for a breakout above $0.27 to signal potential bullish momentum. XRP Price Rally Amid Pullbacks and Key Levels XRP dropped around 16% over the past week and month, following an impressive 237.80% surge over the last six months. The recent decline contrasts sharply with the coin’s strong longer-term gains, showing a shift to short-term sell-offs. Although long-term performance remains notable, the market has faced increasing pressure in recent weeks. XRP currently trades between $1.66 and $2.77, with nearby support at $1.23 and resistance at $3.45. Bears currently dominate as momentum and technical indicators suggest a lack of clear upward direction. Traders may look for buying opportunities if support holds or consider short positions if the price falls below key levels. A break towards $4.56 could signal renewed bullish interest. Conclusion BTC , TRX , and XRP offer strong potential during market downturns. Bitcoin (BTC) remains a leading choice due to its established reputation.

Expert Explains The Hidden Forces,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/why-isnt-xrp-skyrocketing-expert-explains-the-hidden-forces/,"XRP prices dipped below $2 for the first time since December 2024 on Monday, even after a number of positive developments for the cryptocurrency. The decline is surprising to many investors who had hoped recent good news would send its value higher. Market analyst Vincent Van Code attributes this underperformance to underlying economic issues and not with XRP itself. Related Reading: XRP Dump? Not So Fast—Software Engineer Says Panic Selling Makes No Sense Trump Tariffs Are Blamed For Crypto Market Decline Van Code attributes the recent decline in cryptocurrencies to the tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump on other nations. The tariff situation is just a power play to utilize economic pressure to get better negotiating terms, said Van Code. He expects these trade tensions to be short-term and perhaps pave the way for the market to rebound in the near future. Current #XRP prices are not aligned with recent @Ripple market announcenets, SEC case conclusion news, XRP US stockpile. Do you think this is becuase XRP is not performing well? I DONT! This is a global market downturn. Impacts across multiple markets, multiple countries, and… — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) April 9, 2025 XRP Fundamentals Strong Even after falling to $1.64 on April 7, XRP has shown a rebound by increasing to $1.82—a 10% increase. Van Code pointed out that Ripple and XRP’s fundamental strengths have not changed. They’re a hundred times better than a year ago when the SEC lawsuit was at its peak, he said. The SEC-Ripple case resolution, potential inclusion in US digital asset reserves, and Ripple’s Hidden Road acquisition were all considered positive developments for the cryptocurrency. Investment Strategy During Market Uncertainty Van Code described his approach to today’s market condition, showing he buys such assets like XRP when sentiment is low but fundamentals remain in place. He looks at weekly charts for larger decisions and uses hourly charts for intraday action. The market commentator termed XRP the “Fight Club” of cryptos because of its ability to withstand market action and stress. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Next Big Move? Open Interest Says ‘Get Ready’ Future Growth Drivers For XRP Going forward, Van Code identified three key drivers to XRP adoption: regulation, corporate usage, and solid partnerships. He warned investors to avoid being influenced by short-term price fluctuations due to outside influences such as the tariff scenario. The analyst said that he would only be jittery if XRP was the sole cryptocurrency that is dropping in value. He also stated that the current decline is part of a larger market trend and not particular to XRP. The cryptocurrency market still responds to economic policy as investors look for indications that the tariff issue is resolved. Most XRP supporters are optimistic that as soon as these external pressures are gone, the price will more accurately reflect the good news surrounding Ripple and its currency.

DJT” on Truth Social four hours ago. At the time, no one outside his team knew what was coming. Then, minutes ago, he dropped a second post announcing that the United States would immediately raise its tariff on China to 125%. The post also said there would be a 90-day pause for all other countries, during which tariffs would be lowered to 10%. Trump gave a long explanation in the post . Trump said China had shown “a lack of respect” to global markets. He said the new 125% tariff was now in effect. He added that more than 75 countries had contacted U.S. agencies like the Commerce Department, Treasury, and U.S. Trade Representative about issues tied to trade, barriers, tariffs, currency, and non-monetary practices. He said those countries hadn’t hit back at the U.S., so he gave them a temporary deal: a pause, with a 10% rate, also effective now. Markets gain trillions after Trump’s double post Within ten minutes of the second Trump post going live, U.S. stocks added $4 trillion in value. The S&P 500 gained 6%, the Dow Jones rose 2,159 points (a 5.7% jump), and the Nasdaq climbed 8%. This all happened hours after Trump told people to buy. Before this announcement, investors had been reacting to a tit-for-tat exchange between Trump and China. Tensions were climbing fast. The European Union had just confirmed new tariffs on U.S. goods that were set to begin on April 15. Traders were anxious. The markets were already on edge from a four-day losing streak. During those four trading sessions, the Dow had dropped over 4,500 points. The S&P 500 had fallen 12%, and the Nasdaq lost over 13%. That dip hit hard, especially in tech and consumer stocks that had been most exposed to the tariff battles. But everything turned once Trump’s pause was posted. Apple’s stock jumped 7%, Nvidia climbed 10%, and Walmart went up 9%. These were some of the companies hit hardest in the last round of drops, and now they were leading the rebound. After Trump made his posts, Scott Bessent, who now leads the U.S. Treasury, spoke to reporters. He said that the 90-day tariff pause applied to all countries except China. “Only China remains at 125%,” Bessent said. “Everyone else goes to 10% during this window for negotiation.” He also said the pause did not include sector-specific tariffs. So, targeted industries are still facing the old rates. Bessent also said he would personally take the lead in the trade negotiations. That was enough to give Wall Street more confidence, and traders reacted right away. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

On April 9, the House financial services committee’s subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology, and Artificial Intelligence held a hearing on crypto regulation. The goal of the hearing was to find ways to align U.S. securities laws with the realities of the digital age, especially with regard to crypto assets. In his remark to the committee, House Financial Services Committee Chairman French Hill commended the committee’s “bipartisan efforts to bring clarity and stability” to crypto assets. He also stated that he hoped that there would be meaningful legislation by the end of 2025. WATCH: Chairman @RepFrenchHill delivers opening remarks at today’s Subcommittee hearing: ""It is incumbent on us to build on that momentum and continue working toward a comprehensive regulatory framework that establishes clear rules of the road for digital asset markets."" 📺⬇️ pic.twitter.com/sEg0jHeshS — Financial Services GOP (@FinancialCmte) April 9, 2025 “It is incumbent on us to build on that momentum and continue working toward a comprehensive regulatory framework that establishes clear rules of the road for digital asset markets… I look forward to hearing from our whitnesses today, and working with coleagues to get this across the finishline this year,” Rep. French Hill The committee believes in the role of the SEC Despite offering criticism to the SEC, especially under Gary Gensler, committee members highlighted the SEC’s role in regulation. Subcommittee chairman Bryan Steil stated that the SEC would have a role in regulating token offerings. “At the same time, the Committee feels strongly that there is a role for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to play in the digital asset ecosystem. For example, the Committee believes that issuers raising capital through the sale of new digital assets should fall under the jurisdiction of the SEC,” Rep. Bryan Steil This would likely not include memecoins, as the SEC, already under Gensler, ruled that memecoins were not securities. The rationale was that memecoins had no utility and are more akin to collectibles. The committee did face opposition, especially when Rep. Maxine Waters took the floor. She accused the members of the committee of favoritism toward Donald Trump’s crypto ventures, enabling him to become “crypto king.” You might also like: Maxine Waters slams Trump’s crypto ventures in fiery House hearing The hearing is a part of the latest regulatory push to give clarity to crypto assets in the U.S. For instance, on May 22, the U.S. House passed the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act with bipartisan support.

VANCOUVER, BC , April 10, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — USA News Group News Commentary – As tariff talks continue from the White House, gold prices rebounded back above $3,010 , signalling that markets still favor gold as the safe bet for any stagflation or recession. Major banks continue to lean bullish in where gold prices are headed, including HSBC , Bank of America , Standard Chartered , and Citigroup . The recent gold rally has attracted investors back to mining stocks , with gold mining ETFs signaling healthy inflow. Among the miners making moves, recent developments have come from Lake Victoria Gold (TSXV: LVG) (OTCQB: LVGLF), New Gold Inc. (NYSE-American: NGD) (TSX: NGD), Thor Explorations Ltd. (TSXV: THX) (OTCPK: THXPF), WESTGOLD RESOURCES LIMITED (TSX: WGX) (OTCPK: WGXRF), and Dakota Gold Corp. (NYSE-American: DC) The article continued: Analysts are beginning to raise their fair value estimates on mining stocks, as tailwinds support higher gold prices to come. According to VanEck , gold miners substantially outperformed in March , as surging prices sparked M&A activity and drove the largest monthly inflows in over a year. Lake Victoria Gold Ltd. Provides Update on Tembo Project Following Mining License Conversion Lake Victoria Gold (TSXV: LVG) (OTCQB: LVGLF), an emerging East African gold developer, today announced an update on the Company’s Tembo Project, located in the Lake Victoria Goldfield of northern Tanzania , following the successful conversion of its Prospecting License into four Mining Licenses (MLs). The milestone marks a significant advancement in LVG’s strategy to unlock the potential of Tembo, which has already benefited from over US$28 million in exploration expenditures, including 50,000 meters of diamond and RC drilling. The conversion from a Prospecting License to four Mining Licenses grants LVG the legal right to develop and produce from the Tembo Project. Key provisions include that each Mining License (ML) is valid for 10 years, with the option of a further 10-year renewal. “The approval of our Mining Licenses is a pivotal step forward for the Tembo Project,” said Marc Cernovitch, President & CEO of Lake Victoria Gold . “We have always believed in the district-scale potential of this asset. With tenure now secured for the next 10 years, we can focus on evaluating the most efficient development options to unlock maximum shareholder value. This is a transformational moment for the Company and its stakeholders.” Armed with data obtained from the already mentioned +$28 million already invested into exploration at this site in Tanzania , Lake Victoria Gold (LVG) has zeroed in on three high-priority targets showing impressive gold grades and real growth potential. At Ngula 1 , drilling has revealed a 250-meter-wide zone made up of multiple gold-bearing structures that run at least 600 meters in length, and remain open for expansion both deeper and farther out. Some of the more exciting drill results here include hits like 3.13 grams per tonne (g/t) of gold over nearly 26 meters, and an especially rich interval of 22.18 g/t over 15 meters. These numbers point to both strong grade and size—two ingredients that matter when assessing the economic potential of a gold deposit. The Nyakagwe Village target is just as exciting. Here, multiple mineralized structures have produced gold grades as high as 78.1 g/t over one meter and 27.88 g/t over nearly four meters. These are high-grade zones that could feed either near-term mining efforts or future development plans. At Nyakagwe East, drilling has uncovered a 300-meter-wide zone with strong quartz veining and visible sulphide mineralization. Results include intercepts like 19.1 g/t over three meters and 10.25 g/t over 3.5 meters—once again reinforcing the project’s high-grade profile. With Mining Licenses now secured, LVG is evaluating multiple options for how to move Tembo forward . First, there’s real near-term production potential. Some of the shallow, high-grade areas could potentially be mined using open pits once a little more drilling is done, while nearby third-party facilities may allow the company to start producing gold without having to build its own plant right away. Longer term, LVG may still consider building a dedicated processing facility if production volumes justify it. On the exploration side, there’s still plenty of runway for growth . A new drill program is being designed to follow up on historical high-grade hits and convert them into formal resource estimates. A recent study also identified 38 new exploration targets on the property—suggesting that the current high-grade zones might just be the beginning. More fieldwork is underway to test these areas for additional gold discoveries. Finally, LVG is keeping the door open for potential partnerships or strategic deals . The Tembo Project sits right next to Barrick’s massive Bulyanhulu Mine, and the two companies already have a relationship. Back in 2021, LVG sold six non-core licenses to Barrick for $6 million in cash and up to $45 million more in potential contingent payments, which is essentially a bonus if Barrick finds gold on the ground it bought. That deal gave LVG funding to focus on Tembo, while still allowing it to benefit from discoveries made next door. Looking ahead, LVG now has fresh 10-year Mining Licenses at two promising assets. “We believe Tembo represents a rare opportunity to define a new gold camp in one of Tanzania’s most historically productive districts,” said Simon Benstead , Executive Chairman of Lake Victoria Gold . “With multiple exploration and development levers available to us, and a supportive regulatory environment, we’re committed to responsibly unlocking the full value of this high-potential asset.” CONTINUED… Read this and more news for Lake Victoria Gold at: https://usanewsgroup.com/2025/04/02/with-funding-commitments-in-place-a-gold-mine-is-being-built-and-this-stock-is-still-under-0-20/ In other industry developments and happenings in the market include: New Gold Inc. (NYSE-American: NGD) (TSX: NGD) has agreed to acquire the remaining 19.9% free cash flow interest in its New Afton copper-gold mine from the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan for $300 million . The deal will be funded through a mix of available cash, a credit facility, and a gold prepayment arrangement that covers about 8% of New Gold’s expected gold production over the next year. “This is an excellent transaction allowing New Gold to fully consolidate the free cash flow exposure to one of Canada’s highest quality gold/copper assets, which we already own and operate,” said New Gold president and CEO Patrick Godin . “This transaction allows us to grow in an exceptional location with no diligence or integration risk, and with no equity dilution to our shareholders.” This move gives New Gold full 100% free cash flow exposure to New Afton, one of Canada’s top-tier gold-copper assets. Godin also highlighted that with the ramp up of the C-Zone, New Afton is on the verge of exceptional production growth and cost improvement, which should lead to increased free cash flow generation. Thor Explorations Ltd. (TSXV: THX) (OTCPK: THXPF) recently reported strong full-year 2024 results , highlighted by 85,057 ounces of gold poured at its Segilola Gold Mine in Nigeria and the announcement of its maiden dividend. The company also advanced exploration across Nigeria , Senegal , and Côte d’Ivoire, with positive drill results at the Douta project and the discovery of a promising new zone at Baraka 3. “In 2025, the Group’s strategy will be focussed on increasing shareholder value by extending the Segilola mine life and advancing the Douta Project in Senegal ,” said Segun Lawson , President and CEO of Thor Explorations . “At the same time, we are encouraged by the early exploration results on our newly assembled portfolio in Côte d’Ivoire. We look forward to advancing these projects through 2025.” In Côte d’Ivoire, Thor expanded its presence with new acquisitions and began early-stage exploration on several permits. Looking ahead to 2025, Thor has guided for gold production between 85,000–95,000 ounces and plans to spend up to $17.5 million on exploration across West Africa . Backed by strong cash flow and a debt-free balance sheet, Thor is now positioned to self-fund its growth while returning capital to shareholders. WESTGOLD RESOURCES LIMITED (TSX: WGX) (OTCPK: WGXRF) has activated its ore purchase agreement with New Murchison Gold for the Crown Prince gold deposit in Western Australia . Under the deal, Westgold will acquire between 30,000 and 50,000 tonnes of ore per month from the deposit, located just 33km from its Bluebird processing facility in Meekatharra. Ore shipments must meet a minimum gold grade of 1.5 g/t and will be transported by road for processing as part of Westgold’s Murchison operations. This agreement strengthens Westgold’s regional ore supply as it continues to evaluate long-term growth options across its Western Australia asset base. Dakota Gold Corp. (NYSE-American: DC) has closed a $35 million financing , bringing its total cash position to over $47 million and fully funding the company through the completion of a Feasibility Study for its Richmond Hill Oxide Heap Leach Gold Project. Richmond Hill is one of the largest undeveloped gold resources in the U.S. being advanced by a junior, with the next key milestone being the release of an Initial Assessment with Cash Flow (IACF) in mid-2025. Drilling is set to resume in April, as the company progresses toward potential production by 2029 in a favorable U.S. permitting environment.

The token is currently trading near the lower Bollinger Band, with prices hovering well below the 20-day SMA, indicating continued bearish pressure. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 38.23, showing weak momentum and suggesting that Brett is not yet oversold, though approaching that threshold. While today’s 6.24% gain suggests some bullish interest, it may be short-lived unless buying volume increases and the price breaks above the $0.031 resistance zone. Otherwise, Brett risks continued sideways-to-lower consolidation within a weak market structure. BRETT/USD 4-hour chart BRETT/USD 4-hour price chart, Source: TradingView Based on the 4-hour chart, Brett (BRETT) continues to exhibit a stagnant consolidation phase near its recent lows, with price action constrained within a tight Bollinger Band structure. The token is hovering just above the lower band, indicating suppressed volatility and weak momentum. The MACD line is flat and close to the signal line, reflecting indecision among traders and a lack of clear trend direction. Additionally, the Balance of Power (BoP) remains marginally positive, hinting at slight buyer interest, though insufficient to suggest a breakout. Unless Brett breaches resistance at $0.028, further sideways trading or gradual declines may dominate near term.

Based on both the 4-hour and 1-day charts, Brett (BRETT) is currently exhibiting prolonged bearish pressure with limited signs of strong recovery. The 1-day chart shows the token trading near its lower Bollinger Band, suggesting sustained downward momentum and oversold conditions. RSI hovers below 40, indicating weak buying strength. Meanwhile, the 4-hour chart reflects sideways consolidation with low volatility and minimal bullish conviction, as shown by a flat MACD and a neutral Balance of Power reading. Without a decisive move above resistance levels near $0.031, Brett is likely to continue ranging or gradually declining in the short term unless volume surges. Is BRETT a good investment? BRETT cryptocurrency, a meme coin on the Base blockchain, has gained popularity due to its community-driven nature and fixed supply, which enhances scarcity. While it shows growth potential, especially with integrations in DeFi, its value is highly speculative and influenced by market trends. Investors are strongly advised to exercise caution and conduct their research. Will BRETT reach $1? Based on the analysis’s critical prediction, BRETT could reach $1 by 2030, with its potential high projected at $1.16. However, given earlier projections, it is unlikely to reach this milestone before 2030. Will BRETT reach $5? BRETT’s near-term goal of reaching $5 seems unlikely. Current predictions suggest it may peak at around $1 by 2030, influenced by crypto market trends and community support. Is Brett listed on Binance? Brett Coin (BRETT) is currently not listed on Binance for trading. Although it remains available on other exchanges like Bybit, Gate.io , and KuCoin Does BRETT have a good long-term future? BRETT is projected to reach between $0.70 by 2027 and $1 by 2030, depending on market conditions and the adoption of the Base network. Its growth is expected to be influenced by cryptocurrency market trends and regulatory developments.

Says PlanB, “Even with today’s low bitcoin prices my on-chain indicators still signal bull market.

In a recent video update, the analyst told his 209,000 YouTube subscribers that a combination of 200-week means suggests Bitcoin may soon enter an explosive uptrend based on historical precedent. The analyst says that the 200-week arithmetic and the 200-week geometric are currently running close together on the chart, signaling a possible Bitcoin breakout. “It might be that the bull market is still forming and that the [arithmetic mean] will separate again, will diverge again, from the geometric mean. One more thing on those two lines. Notice that you can’t have a bear market or a big crash when the 200-week [arithmetic mean] and the geometric mean are together. The big crashes here [in 2021 and 2022] are happening when there’s a diversion between the two lines. Also, here in 2018, there was a big gap between the two [means].

Tariff increase caused a drop in Bitcoin’s value, falling below $76,000, as markets reacted to fears of a prolonged trade conflict. Both traditional and crypto markets are experiencing heightened volatility, with investors concerned about the potential for an extended trade war. In a sudden escalation of trade tensions between the U.S. and China, the Chinese government announced on April 9 that it will impose a dramatic increase in tariffs on U.S. imports, raising them from 34% to 84%. Bitcoin experienced a sharp drop in value following the announcement, falling below the critical $76,000 mark. This latest retaliatory move from China comes in response to recent actions by the U.S., which imposed 104% tariffs on Chinese goods on April 9 after announcing the move April 8. China raised retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods to 84% after President Trump's latest levies kicked in https://t.co/l4A7HEvtim — The Wall Street Journal (@WSJ) April 9, 2025 While the U.S. government has argued that the tariffs are necessary to address unfair trade practices by China, the Chinese government’s decision to raise tariffs is aimed at leveling the playing field and protecting its domestic industries. Tariffs Send Shockwaves Through Global Markets The announcement of these new tariffs has sent shockwaves through global markets, triggering a sell-off in various asset classes. Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies had initially shown positive momentum, with early gains hinting at a potential rally. However, as news of China’s retaliatory tariffs spread, market sentiment soured, and fears of a prolonged trade conflict led to a reversal in the cryptocurrency market. Risky Cryptos Have Been Completely Pulverized, Says Analyst “The current Trade War has caused volatility across the board, and we can clearly see the remarkable difference between the likes of Bitcoin, which is down 30% from the peak, to some of the more risky cryptos that have been completely pulverized,” Quantum Economics founder and analyst Mati Greenspan told CryptoNews. “The Trump administration has been really amazing for crypto innovation in the United States so far, with the new SEC dropping cases, a stablecoin bill rushing through Congress and the recent disband of the Biden anti-crypto task force. We’ve gone from operation chokepoint 2.0 to open season for crypto builders overnight,” said Greenspan. Bitcoin’s decline is a reflection of broader market anxiety surrounding the economic uncertainty created by the trade tensions. Investors often turn to digital currencies like Bitcoin as a hedge against traditional market volatility. However, in times of heightened uncertainty, risk aversion can cause major sell-offs in even the most speculative assets, leading to price declines. The drop below $76,000 shows a considerable retreat from Bitcoin’s recent highs, highlighting the fragility of the market.. “For those who believe that Trump’s strategy of shaking the markets is one of short term pain for long term gain, this is an excellent time to invest on solid fundamentals,” said Greenspan. As the U.S.-China trade war continues to evolve, both traditional and digital markets will likely remain volatile. In the meantime, investors are having to navigate an increasingly unpredictable economic landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How are escalating U.S.-China tariffs impacting global supply chains? The tariff conflict between the U.S. and China is majorly disrupting established supply chains , as companies seek alternative manufacturing locations to sidestep rising costs. This will likely lead to production delays and higher operational expenses, especially for industries like electronics and textiles that are deeply tied to Chinese manufacturing. The broader economic fallout includes potential job losses in affected regions and huge shifts in global trade patterns. What are the consequences of the U.S.-China trade war on the American economy? Tariff measures act like additional taxes and could cost up to $1,500 per U.S. household as early as 2025 according to the Tax Foundation. Simultaneously, Chinese countermeasures on U.S. agricultural exports are eroding the competitive edge of American farmers in global markets. How is the trade war affecting the bond market and interest rates? Trade tensions are fueling instability in the U.S. bond market. As investors grow wary of the economic outlook, rapid sell-offs in U.S. Treasuries are pushing yields higher, signaling diminished confidence in government debt. Fears surrounding potential reductions in Chinese Treasury holdings and the unwinding of hedge fund positions further complicate the Federal Reserve’s efforts to manage interest rates in such a volatile climate. Could China leverage its position in rare earth exports as a response to U.S. tariffs? China dominates the global supply of rare earth elements, which are critical for electronics, weapons systems, and renewable energy tech. Although Canada could theoretically fill some of that rare earth elements demand , the trade wars are also impacting relations between that country. By restricting exports, China could disrupt American production in high tech industries.

While XRP has struggled recently, Standard Chartered foresees a major price jump in the following years, fueled by the potential approval of XRP ETFs under Trump’s administration. ‘XRP Network is Growing Stronger’ Ripple’s XRP has been on a severe downtrend lately, mirroring the overall slump of the cryptocurrency market. It currently trades at $1.83, a nearly 50% collapse from the local top observed in mid-January. Despite the plunge, some important indicators have been on the rise, which could indicate a potential bullish move in the future. The popular analyst Ali Martinez estimated that “the XRP network is growing stronger” as the number of addresses holding at least one token has reached an all-time high (ATH) of 6.26 million. The figure stood at less than 6.23 million at the end of March. The development signals increased adoption and growing interest in the cryptocurrency . The metric’s rise could also reflect confidence among investors and hint that more individuals or entities are accumulating XRP, possibly in anticipation of future price increases. Meanwhile, other Ripple indicators have also headed north in the past few days. These include the number of active accounts , the number of executed transactions, and more . Price Explosion in the Next Years? XRP’s downward spiral as of late hasn’t stopped people or companies from making optimistic predictions. Recently, the British multinational bank Standard Chartered predicted that the price of Ripple’s cross-border token could soar to $5.50 this year and a whopping $12.50 by the end of 2028 (shortly before the end of Donald Trump’s term). The entity suggested that the potential approval of XRP exchange-traded funds while the Republican remains in power will act as a key driving force. Earlier in April, asset manager Teucrium introduced the first XRP-based ETF in the US , but the launch of an investment vehicle that directly tracks the price of the underlying token has yet to see the light of day . Teucrium’s product saw some notable volume on its first day, as Eric Balchunas said. $XXRP (2x XRP ETF) saw $5mil in volume on Day One, very respectable, esp considering the mkt conditions. That puts it in approx top 5% of new ETF launches, and about 4x what the 2x Solana ETF $SOLT did (altho both 200x less than King IBIT). pic.twitter.com/u3QQq5yuHv — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) April 8, 2025 The post Important Ripple (XRP) Metric Just Hit an All-Time High: Details Here appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|XRPBTC|XRPUSD|Ripple (XRP) Price,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|TRADING|XRP|ZRX,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-04-09 18:10:15

Data from CryptoQuant indicated that the BTC-USDT futures leverage ratio with respect to open interest (OI) has halved since peaking in early 2025. Bitcoin estimated futures leveraged ratio. Source: CryptoQuant This significant de-leveraging has occurred because of massive liquidations over the past few weeks, which has effectively taken a majority of traders out of the market. Thus, the current market conditions indicate a healthier market reset, which is not overheated and could potentially pave the way for a steady price recovery. Bitcoin’s open interest dropped 28% from $71.8 billion on Dec. 18 to $51.8 billion on April 8. This underscores the magnitude of the current deleveraging event. Although this may induce short-term volatility, as few market players might control the price, it also positions BTC for stability in the long term, offering an advantage in the current uncertain trend.

Source: X.com The analyst explained that Bitcoin might have already completed 75-80% of its correction, declining from $109,000 to $74,500. Historically, prices have fallen by as much as 34% during the six-to-eight-week span of such trends. Currently, Bitcoin has dropped 31% from its all-time high, and a further decline to $72,000-$70,000 would bring it to approximately 34%. Sina added, “Absent a recession, $70K is my worst-case scenario. While the macro backdrop remains grim and further sell-off is possible, we think Bitcoin is deeply undervalued for a long-term investor.” However, the likelihood of an immediate recovery remains low, as Bitcoin researcher Axel Adler Jr. expects BTC to move sideways in the “volatility corridor.” Bitcoin support and resistance level. Source: X.com The volatility corridor identified a price range of $75,000 to $96,000, outlined with the help of short-term holders’ realized prices over different time periods. Adler Jr. said that it was possible that BTC would consolidate between these levels over the next few weeks but warned that the price must hold a position above the 365-day simple moving average. A break below the key indicator could potentially lead to a new yearly low below the $74,500 level, with the ideal price being $70,000, as noted earlier.

The move is Beijing's latest bid to prevent a sharp depreciation of its currency amid mounting economic pressures stemming from escalating trade tensions with the United States. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) issued the guidance this week through “window guidance,” an informal policy tool used to guide market behavior without official announcements. State banks were told to avoid buying U.S. dollars for their own private accounts, three people said. One source added that banks were asked to exercise stricter control when executing dollar orders for their clients, which he interpreted as a crackdown on speculative trading. Today, state-owned lenders were seen intervening in the onshore foreign exchange market, selling US dollars and buying yuan to slow the pace of depreciation. The onshore yuan has fallen about 1.3% this month to 7.35 per dollar, while the offshore yuan briefly hit a record low overnight. Related News: After Declines, Donald Trump's Project Also Couldn't Resist: They Started Selling Altcoin, Here's What They Did Despite pressure from U.S. tariffs and Beijing's retaliatory measures, the PBOC has resisted calls to devalue the yuan sharply. Three policy advisers and one banker familiar with the central bank's stance told Reuters any depreciation would be kept modest so as not to shake market confidence. “There will be no sharp depreciation as it could hurt market confidence, but a modest depreciation would help exports,” one of the advisers said. “We should also help key businesses through subsidies, tax rebates or market diversification.” The intervention signals the PBOC's continued prioritization of financial stability as an escalating U.S. trade war with sweeping tariffs, including a 104% tariff on some Chinese goods by President Donald Trump, threatens China's export-reliant economy. A weaker yuan could boost export competitiveness by lowering the price of Chinese goods abroad, but analysts warn that a steep devaluation could trigger capital outflows and jeopardize financial stability. *This is not investment advice.

From his Truth Social account, Trump said that over 75 countries “have called Representatives of the United States” to discuss trade negotiations after Trump’s onslaught of global tariffs last week. This prompted him to lower he reciprocal tariffs on those countries to 10%, effective immediately. “Thank you to your attention on this matter,” Trump stated. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said he sat with the President and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent as Trump crafted the post. “The world is ready to work with President Trump to fix global trade, and China has chosen the opposite direction,” he tweeted Wednesday. China’s tariffs remain in place, and have been increased to 125%, due to their “lack of respect” for global markets, Trump said.

33767162,[object Object],1744225241,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Dogecoin Price Is In The Anger Phase: Don’t Get Caught In This Trap, Analyst Warns",https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-is-in-the-anger-phase/,"Crypto analyst Selim has provided an in-depth analysis of the Dogecoin price action . He revealed that the foremost meme coin is about to enter the anger phase and warned investors not to get caught in the trap. Dogecoin Price About To Enter The Anger Phase In a TradingView post , Selim stated that based on recent Dogecoin price action and classic market psychology cycles, DOGE appears to be entering the Anger phase. He explained that this is a point where many retail traders give up and start blaming the market or external forces, while smart money starts preparing to accumulate. In line with this, the analyst warned investors not to get caught in the trap before the rally begins. Selim then went on to break down these market psychology cycles. Using the ‘ Stock Market Psychology Cycle ,’ he noted that the Dogecoin price has already moved through the Euphoria phase when it touched $0.43. DOGE also moved through the Complacency to Denial phase when it pulled back to between $0.28 and $0.20, while the Panic and Capitulation phase occurred when the meme coin dropped to $0.14. How It Could Play Out For The Meme Coin With the Dogecoin price now hovering between $0.12 and $0.13, the analyst noted that this matches the sentiment of anger, where people complain about manipulation and finally capitulate. Moving forward, Selim predicts that DOGE could record a short-term relief rally to $0.19, attracting late buyers and creating a bull trap . Once that happens, he predicts that the Dogecoin price will pull back to $0.11, which would represent a final shakeout, trigger stop losses, and lead to talks about DOGE being dead. The analyst believes a strong reversal will then happen after that, with the foremost meme coin targeting $0.23, fueled by tax season ending, meme coin rotation, and potential DOGE narrative catalyst. Selim revealed his strategy amid this Dogecoin price crash. He stated that he would watch closely for the rejection near $0.19 and plan to accumulate near $0.11 if volume confirms support. Meanwhile, the analyst is targeting $0.23 as the disbelief rally kicks in. DOGE Could Still Drop To As Low As $0.06 In an X post, crypto analyst Ali Martinez warned that the Dogecoin price could still drop to as low as $0.060. He stated that the foremost meme coin is breaking out of an ascending parallel channel, which signals a potential move toward this target. Ahead of this potential Dogecoin price crash, DOGE whales are heavily capitulating and offloading their holdings. Martinez revealed that these whales have sold over 1.32 billion DOGE in the last 48 hours. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.14, down over 4% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",Altcoins|Ali Martinez|capitulation|Coinmarketcap|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|Dogecoin whales|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Selim|Stock Market,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|RUNE|FET|SEI|JUP|BSV|AGX|ZK|WLD|CAKE|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-04-09 19:00:41

In a recent publication, the firm said the software project on the website, Office Package, contains an address-poisoning malware targeting crypto users. According to the report, the Office package software is a legitimate project containing Microsoft Office add-ins. However, a closer investigation reveals more about the package, as it contains download links that lead to a different URL. It said: “The project under investigation has been assigned the domain officepackage.sourceforge[.]io, but the page displayed when you go to that domain looks nothing like officepackage on sourceforge.net.” Interestingly, the malware download process is quite complex, with users going through three URLs before they can download the file. The complex process appears to be part of the scheme to lure users into believing they are downloading a genuine application. Kaspersky security experts noted the final installation file is installer.msi, a 700-megabyte file that bad actors inflated size to make it look like an authentic software installer. After stripping away the junk bytes, the real size is seven megabytes. Infection chain for the malware (Kaspersky) By running the installer, users unwittingly install two malicious applications into their devices, a miner and a ClipBanker. The ClipBanker allows address poisoning by replacing crypto addresses copied onto the clipboard with those of the attacker, leading users to send funds to the wrong addresses. The security experts wrote: “The key malicious actions in this campaign boil down to running two AutoIt scripts. Icon.dll restarts the AutoIt interpreter and injects a miner into it, while Kape.dll does the same but injects ClipBanker.” Meanwhile, they also noted that the attack focused mostly on Russian targets. Signs of this include the Russian interface for the officepackage.sourceforge[.]io site and the fact that 90% of the 4,604 users encountered the malware between January and late March are Russian. Address poisoning scams increasing The Kaspersky report corresponds with the recent rise in address poisoning attacks on crypto users, as reported by several blockchain security firms. According to data from Scam Sniffer, the third-biggest phishing incident in March was due to address poisoning. Cyvers also reported that address poisoning scams caused a loss of more than $1.2 million within the first three weeks of March, adding to the $1.8 million in February. The firm said its AI threat detection system identified an increase in address poisoning attacks. While most address poisoning attacks result from attackers manually sending small transactions to the victims with addresses similar to the ones they frequently use, the use of sophisticated malware that allows attackers to change addresses from the clipboard shows how bad actors continue to evolve. Security experts believe the number one solution to this problem is for users to avoid downloading software from untrusted sources. They noted that bad actors usually exploit unofficial software websites to distribute malicious applications, and people using such websites must be aware of that risk. However, they noted that this malware presents an even bigger problem as provides an inventive way for attackers to gain access to infected systems. Thus, there is a possibility that the creators can decide to use it for more than targeting crypto users and start selling it to more dangerous bad actors.

These tariff policies, central to President Donald Trump’s “America First” agenda, aim to protect domestic industries and reduce U.S. trade deficits. But beyond American borders, such policies have the power to reshape the global economy, disrupt supply chains, and shift geopolitical alliances. While tariffs are often framed as domestic economic tools, their global ripple effects are far-reaching. They influence how and where products are made, which countries align economically, and how trade relationships evolve. Below, we explore three key ways Trump’s tariffs could alter the international landscape. Global supply chain disruption One of the most immediate impacts of renewed tariffs would be on global supply chains. Many companies rely on cross-border production, particularly in sectors like electronics, automotive, and consumer goods. Tariffs increase the cost of importing components and finished products, which encourages companies to relocate production or source from tariff-free regions. For example, U.S. companies might shift operations from China to countries like Vietnam, India, or Mexico to bypass duties. This can drive short-term inflation and inefficiencies, but also open up new economic opportunities for emerging markets. Over time, these shifts can lead to a more fragmented global production network, increasing regionalization and decreasing dependency on any single nation, especially China. However, the transition is neither quick nor seamless. Realigning supply chains takes time, capital, and logistical overhaul, and during the process, both consumers and businesses bear the cost in the form of higher prices and production delays. Read more: BREAKING: Bitcoin reclaims $81k amid tariff pause, China still hit with 125% rate Increasing Volatility In the Cryptocurrency Market Trump’s tariffs are having notable effects on the cryptocurrency market. Trade tensions and global economic uncertainty often drive investors toward non-traditional assets like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which are viewed by some as hedges against fiat instability and geopolitical risk. As tariffs disrupt global trade and contribute to inflation or dollar volatility, crypto markets could experience increased speculative interest and capital inflows. For crypto traders, this environment could lead to heightened volatility, presenting both risk and opportunity. Additionally, if tariffs contribute to weakening trust in centralized financial systems, they may reinforce the narrative around decentralization and self-custody — core principles that underpin the crypto space. Weakening of trade institutions and multilateralism Trump’s tariff strategy, especially during his first term, often bypassed global trade frameworks in favor of bilateral deals and nationalistic policies. A return to this approach could further undermine the credibility and function of international trade institutions. This weakening of multilateralism may lead to more countries adopting unilateral trade measures, increasing friction in global commerce. The international trading system, once reliant on rules-based cooperation, could devolve into a network of isolated, self-interested blocs. This fragmentation poses a serious risk to global stability and predictability in trade relations. A shift in geopolitical and economic power Trade is no longer just an economic tool, it’s a weapon of diplomacy. Tariffs on strategic industries such as semiconductors, clean energy, and technology components can reshape global alliances. As the U.S. decouples further from China, nations may be forced to choose sides, deepening the divide between Western and Eastern economic spheres. This could result in competing technological ecosystems, shifts in energy resource control, and even new political alliances that circumvent the U.S. altogether. China, for instance, may strengthen its ties with BRICS nations or push forward its Belt and Road Initiative to counterbalance U.S. influence. The result is a more polarized global economy, with less collaboration and more competition. Trump’s tariff-driven trade agenda is not just about economic nationalism — it’s a strategic lever that could redefine global power dynamics. While the intent is to bolster domestic industry and reduce dependence on foreign goods, the long-term global consequences are profound. Understanding these broader implications is crucial — not just for policymakers, but for businesses, investors, and citizens navigating an increasingly complex global economy.",Markets|crypto|Donald Trump|stocks,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-04-09 19:02:53

Spokespeople for the project told Cointelegraph they are considering rewarding early sticker holders with future perks, though no specifics were shared. Flair told Cointelegraph that the project was launched to drive community engagement and added: ""Telegram is where people are really showing up these days. It is global, it is fast, and the way people communicate there just felt like the perfect fit for what we are doing. These stickers are about energy, personality, and culture, and Telegram is the place to bring that to life."" The wrestler's tokenized sticker launch follows mixed-martial arts champion and Irish political candidate Conor McGregor's memecoin launch on April 5, which failed and highlights the struggle of risk-on investments and digital assets amid the recent macroeconomic downturn. Flair, who retired from wrestling in 2022, has previously ventured into the crypto space. In 2024, he introduced the ""Wooooo!"" coin (WOOOOO), a memecoin inspired by his iconic catchphrase. The token has no trading activity as of April 9, 2025, with only one address controlling over 70% of the supply, according to CoinMarketCap. The legendary wrestler has a history of merchandising his brand through various collectibles, including physical stickers available on his official online store and Amazon.

The market for memecoins and other social tokens peaked in December 2024 amid a historic rally in the crypto markets. However, since then, memecoin prices have plummeted, with many top-tier memecoins such as Dogecoin ( DOGE ) and Pepe ( PEPE ) shedding approximately 70-80% of their value over the period. The macroeconomic uncertainty from the ongoing trade war has also damped the appetite for riskier assets as investors flee into more stable investments like cash, government bonds, and stablecoins.

Amid this, Pepe (PEPE), the popular meme coin, has formed a bullish price action and is poised for a massive upside rally. Pepe (PEPE) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to expert technical analysis, PEPE appears to be forming a bullish double-bottom price pattern on the daily time frame. In addition to this bullish pattern, the meme coin has also broken out of a descending trendline that it had been following since March 26, 2025. Source: Trading View Based on recent price momentum and historical patterns, if the PEPE price holds above the $0.00000678 level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 30% to reach the $0.0000090 level in the future. Source: Trading View Despite this bullish price action, PEPE is currently trading below the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily time frame, indicating strong bearish sentiment for the asset. Current Price Momentum At press time, PEPE is trading near $0.00000698 and has registered a price surge of over 15% in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, during the same period, its trading volume jumped by 75%, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day. Why Is PEPE’s Price Rising? The potential reason behind this sudden price surge is President Donald Trump’s recent post on X (formerly Twitter). In the post, Trump stated, “I have authorized a 90-day PAUSE, and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of 10%, also effective immediately.

XRP’s rally comes on the heels of additional positive news and the XXRP ETF being launched on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Arca. Despite the positive macroeconomic and TradFi crypto adoption news, XRP charts still caution that a sharp price downside could lie ahead. Descending triangle pattern hints at a 33% drop Since December 2024, XRP price has been forming a potential triangle pattern on its daily chart, characterized by a flat support level mixed with a downward-sloping resistance line. A descending triangle chart pattern that forms after a strong uptrend is seen as a bearish reversal indicator. As a rule, the setup resolves when the price breaks below the flat support level and falls by as much as the triangle’s maximum height. The price dropped below the triangle’s support line at $2 on April 6, confirming a potential breakdown move. In this case, the price may fall toward the downside target at around $1.20 by the end of April, down 33% from current price levels. XRP/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/ TradingView XRP’s descending triangle target echoes trader CasiTrade's prediction that the altcoin could drop as low as $1.55 due to a “textbook” Elliott Wave Theory analysis. “Right now, $1.81 is a critical level to break in this plan,” the trader said in an April 8 post on X, adding that if the price loses that level, it would confirm a deeper move. According to CasiTrades, the next level to watch would be $1.71, where the price would pause temporarily before the “projected final low” at $1.55. “Key zone: $1.55 is the golden retracement and the likely end to this entire corrective W2.” XRP/USD 15-minute chart.

Despite the launch of the XXRP ETF on NYSE Arca on April 8, 2025, XRP’s price remains precarious due to a mix of market dynamics and escalating trade wars . The 2x leveraged ETF, designed to amplify XRP’s daily returns, debuted amid heightened volatility, with XRP trading at around $1.71 after a 7.4% drop in 24 hours. The XXRP ETF attracted $5 million in first-day volume, in what Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas termed a commendable achievement considering the ongoing tumult in crypto and other global markets. Although this was 200x less than the volume posted by BlackRock's IBIT ETF on day one, this performance puts XXRP in the top 5% of new ETF launches.

In a translated letter introducing the potential new approach, Ruslan Magomedov, head of Ukraine’s National Securities and Stock Market Commission , said that effective tax policy is a necessary step in preventing financial abuse and facilitating the “legal and responsible use of digital assets.” “Establishing fair and understandable taxation rules is also a prerequisite for attracting investment and integrating the Ukrainian virtual asset market into the global financial market,” Magomedov added. Under the NSSMC’s suggested tax scheme, certain crypto transactions — essentially those in which non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies are cashed out for fiat currency or exchanged for goods or services, and during which there were no financial losses from the transaction — would be taxed at Ukraine’s standard personal income tax rate of 18%, plus the additional 5% wartime levy that went into effect last December . Crypto-to-crypto transactions would not be subject to taxation under the proposed tax matrix, which is in line with how several other European countries including Austria and France, as well as crypto-friendly jurisdictions like Singapore, handle crypto taxation. Because Ukraine’s tax code exempts any income generated from transactions with foreign exchange values from being taxed, the NSSMC suggested “it makes sense to consider a preferential rate or exemption from taxation” for foreign asset-backed stablecoins and certain asset-referenced tokens (ARTs). The suggested preferential tax rate under the matrix could be either 5% or 9%. The matrix also offered a variety of taxation options for other types of crypto transactions, including mining, which the NSSMC suggested could be considered a “business activity”; staking, which the regulator said could either be “considered as business captive income” or taxed only at the cash-out stage; as well as hard-forks and airdrops, which the regulator said could either be taxed as ordinary income or only at the cash-out stage. Ukraine had previously introduced a draft law similarly amending the country’s tax code to cover cryptocurrency in 2023. A 2024 analysis from Swiss blockchain analytics firm Global Ledger found that Ukraine could stand to collect over $200 million in annual taxes from crypto transactions. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky officially legalized the country’s cryptocurrency sector in 2022, determining the industry’s regulators and giving them the go-ahead to create specific regulations. The National Bank of Ukraine is currently working on a draft law based on the European Union’s (EU) Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation.

Brantly Millegan announced the news in a post on X. This marks significant headway following the effort of key players in the cryptocurrency industry to secure his release. Griffith’s Work With Ethereum Foundation According to Millegan’s post, Griffith was released in the early hours of April 9 but will remain in a “halfway house” for a few weeks. The former Ethereum Foundation developer will also face work restrictions besides his parole. Millegan’s X post included a picture of Griffith and his parents, allegedly taken this morning just outside the prison. Before going to prison, Griffith offered his services to the Ethereum Foundation and the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), which is funded by the former. Griffith became a part of the Ethereum Foundation around 2016. He is greatly recognized for his early work on the ENS and other protocol-level improvements. US Government Goes After Griffith Griffith has a Ph.D. in computation and neural systems from Caltech. Some of his products are WikiScanner, a tool to track Wikipedia edits, and Tor2web, which he created with lauded cryptographer Aaron Swartz. The duo created this tool to serve as an interface for accessing hidden Tor websites via regular web browsers. Millegan recalled when Griffith gave a presentation called Blockchains for Peace in North Korea. This presentation, which he gave, attracted the attention of the US government, although he was not charged with any crime at the time. Virgil Griffith Gets Reduced Jail Sentence Griffith was later sentenced to 5 years and 3 months in a US prison in 2022 for violating sanctions law. US prosecutors accused him of presenting “technical advice on using cryptocurrency and blockchain technology to evade sanctions.” These allegations highlighted the growing use of cryptocurrencies to evade sanctions , especially among high-profile individuals. It is worth noting that Griffith had pleaded guilty to sanctions violations a year before this time. By July 2024, U.S. District Judge Kevin Castel reduced his sentence to 56 months. As it stands, this sentence is yet to be fulfilled.

That spike came as investors dumped long-term US debt, reacting to Donald Trump’s trade tariffs and rising fears that US assets are no longer safe. The warning came directly from George Saravelos, global head of FX strategy at Deutsche. He said in a note that “if recent disruption in the US Treasury market continues, we see no other option for the Fed but to step in with emergency purchases of US Treasuries to stabilize the bond market.” George called it a “circuit breaker.” The last time something like this happened was in 2020, when the Fed slashed rates and started a massive bond-buying program to stop a COVID-era financial collapse. Fed holds back despite chaos in bond market The Fed hasn’t made any moves yet. No announcements, no liquidity support, no signal that it’s ready to jump in. Meanwhile, the selloff in Treasuries is picking up speed. The 5.02% yield number is now in play, and if that continues, Jerome Powell and his team will have no room left to wait it out. George said the real problem isn’t just yields—it’s policy. He said that “a reversal of the Trump administration’s policies would be necessary to stabilize medium-term shifts.” The chaos in the market isn’t just about interest rates or inflation. It’s about trust. And right now, that trust is breaking down. Deutsche called the dollar’s collapse a “crisis of confidence.” On Wednesday, the greenback fell against most major currencies. Instead of buying dollars like they normally would during times of stress, foreign investors are actively dumping US assets altogether. “The market has lost faith in US assets, so that instead of closing the asset-liability mismatch by hoarding dollar liquidity it is actively selling down the US assets themselves,” George said. Economists say Fed is stuck with inflation and bad timing Michael Gapen, chief US economist at Morgan Stanley, said the Fed isn’t going to cut interest rates anytime soon. Speaking Monday on Bloomberg TV, Michael said, “If we don’t get a recession, it’s going to be hard for the Fed to look through this inflation in the short run. The Fed’s going to be on hold for the foreseeable future.” The problem is, inflation is still hot. The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge hit 2.8% in the 12 months through February—way over their 2% target—and that number came before the new Trump tariffs even had time to jack up prices. On top of that, inflation expectations are rising. One of the long-term metrics the Fed watches has now ticked up for three straight months. The Fed has a long history of stepping in when markets fall apart. In March 2020, right after the US started pandemic lockdowns, the Fed made an emergency rate cut outside of a regular meeting. It was a panic move—but it worked. Even as stocks plunge and consumer sentiment slides, Powell isn’t blinking. He said Friday that the Fed has an “obligation” to keep expectations anchored and claimed the current rate levels are “well-positioned.” Powell said the economy is “still in a good place,” based on the latest data, and didn’t even bring up the stock market drop. Some analysts believe the longer the tariffs stay, the worse things will get. If yields stay high and foreign investors keep bailing, a full-scale financial slowdown is back on the table. The Fed might be hoping to wait it out, but if bond yields don’t back down, they may have no choice left but to step in and buy. Whether they like it or not.

According to blockchain analytics firm Glassnode, over 80% of their circulating supply is still held in profit despite double-digit declines across crypto and traditional assets. TRX and XRP Hold Firm The global financial markets have been hit by the weight of escalating tensions between the U.S. and many of its trading partners. As previously reported , digital assets have seen more than $500 billion wiped out in the past month, with nearly half of that lost in a single 24-hour period. The tariff-induced bloodbath marked one of the steepest corrections since March 2020, with Bitcoin (BTC) dropping to around $74,000 at one point and Ethereum (ETH) plunging well below key psychological levels. However, in the middle of the storm, TRX and XRP have emerged as unlikely pockets of resilience. Looking at data shared by Glassnode, 84.6% of TRON’s circulating supply remains in profit, having declined by just 5.6 percentage points year-to-date. XRP follows closely, with 81.6% of its supply still in the green, despite a much larger drop of 10.4 points since the start of the year. The performance of the two assets stands in stark contrast to Ethereum and Solana (SOL), where only 44.9% and 31.6% of their respective supplies are in profit, meaning that the majority of holders are now underwater. Reeling from a $200 million unlock and major whale sell-offs at the start of the month, SOL’s price collapsed to $101 from highs of nearly $290 earlier in the year. While analysts have warned of a possible drop to $60, the token has regained some of its vigor, adding about 3% to its value in the last 24 hours to trade at $109. On the other hand, Ethereum just experienced its worst start to a year, registering consecutive losses in the first three months of 2025. The altcoin is currently trading at about $1,557, nearly 17% below its price from a week ago. BTC, TON, and ONDO Sit in the Middle Glassnode’s data also highlighted a middle ground occupied by several big name crypto assets, including the largest by market cap, Bitcoin, as well as Toncoin (TON), and Ondo (ONDO). BTC, often seen as a bellwether for the rest of the market, still has 76.8% of its supply in profit, despite an 11.9 percentage point drop this year. TON maintains a marginally lower 76.7% of its supply above the water, while ONDO, a relative newcomer, shows 74.3% of its supply in the green, although that’s down over 22 percentage points.

To read full editions, subscribe . As equities posted a modest rebound, it was US Treasury markets that had Wall Street worried this morning. The 10-year yield climbed above 4.51% around midnight, just as President Trump’s 104% tariff against Chinese imports went into effect. The question on everyone’s mind now is why. I know I wrote yesterday that foreign bond holders could be selling, and this is still a possibility. But the overnight moves point to a perhaps more frightening reality: The basis trade is unwinding. Hedge funds frequently employ a Treasury basis trade strategy. It’s an arbitrage trade that looks to exploit the tiny price differences between Treasurys and futures. It’s low-risk and low-reward, but huge when leveraged — so funds typically borrow to fund these trades and multiply their bets. Mass selling causes Treasury yields to spike, like we saw last night. The lower the price falls (remember Treasury prices and yields are inversely correlated), the more margin calls we see, and the more selling we see to meet those calls. Plus, liquidity evaporates when the number of sellers is vastly greater than buyers. “If it’s not a case of selling winners to pay up margin elsewhere, then maybe it’s a market bracing for a deep recession that would start with a 7% deficit that will then only get worse,” Pepperstone research strategist Michael Brown said. “I’m honestly not sure which of those scenarios is worse.” So either way — bad. As Joseph Wang said : “This might become a legitimate market functioning issue.” We saw an unwinding in 2020. Yield on the 10-year went from a record low of 0.3% to 1.2% in a matter of days in March 2020. The Fed intervened with quantitative easing on March 23, 2020, and by the end of the month the 10-year yield had retreated back to around 0.7%. There is a little bit of good news, though: The Treasury’s 10-year auction today was strong. Indirect bidders, which represent an imperfect proxy for foreign buyers, made up about 88% of accepted bids (higher than the average). In yesterday’s three-year auction , 73% went to indirect bidders. Direct bidders however were down 45% from January. We don’t know exactly who is selling, which is why you’ve seen a lot of speculation around what’s fueling the selloff in Treasurys (including in this newsletter). The Treasury reports foreign holder data monthly, but there’s a six-week lag. We won’t get February’s holdings until next week. We also don’t know what the Fed will do. Odds of an interest rate cut in May actually decreased today, hovering around 38% after spiking to 45% yesterday, per CME Group data . You’ll be the first to hear, though, when we have some answers.

Analysts Explain",https://www.newsbtc.com/ethereum-news/ethereum-may-be-headed-to-1200-can-eth-make-a-comeback-analysts-explain/,"Ethereum (ETH) has plunged 30% over the past two weeks, reflecting broader weakness across the crypto market as the global economy reels from escalating tariff wars. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez warns that ETH could fall even further in the near term, potentially testing the $1,200 level. More Pain For Ethereum, But A Recovery Is Possible Ethereum continues to struggle amid global economic pressures. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has dropped another 8.3% in the past 24 hours and is currently trading in the mid-$1,000 range. Related Reading: Is Ethereum Breaking Free from the Bear Trap? Analysts Weigh In Commenting on the recent price action, seasoned analyst Martinez highlighted that ETH could find key support at the $1,200 mark. He shared the following daily chart of ETH, showing how the digital asset has broken through multiple support levels since December 2024, when it was trading near $4,000. Meanwhile, renowned analyst Carl Moon noted that ETH is currently trading below its realized price of $2,000. He pointed out that the last time this occurred – back in March 2020 at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic – ETH had dropped from $289 to $109. On a more optimistic note, Moon added that ETH recovered swiftly after that steep decline. Based on historical trends, the current price level could present a potential buying opportunity for long-term investors. For those unfamiliar, the realized price for accumulation addresses – as shown in the above CryptoRank chart – represents the average price at which long-term holders acquired ETH. This metric has historically acted as a strong support zone. Is ETH About To Surprise The Market? With market sentiment approaching historical lows, confidence in ETH appears to be dwindling. The Ethereum Fear & Greed Index currently sits at 20, indicating “extreme fear” among investors. Related Reading: Is Ethereum Repeating Its 2020 Trend Reversal? Analyst Predicts ETH To ‘Explode’ In Q2 2025 Despite the bearish mood, some on-chain metrics and historical patterns suggest ETH could be on the verge of a strong bullish reversal – potentially catching investors off guard. For example, crypto analyst Mister Crypto recently drew a comparison between ETH’s current price action and that from 2020, suggesting that Ethereum could embark on a price rally by Q2 2025. Similarly, Ethereum’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Z-score hints that ETH may be undervalued at current price. The last time it was this undervalued – in October 2023 – it witnessed a sharp rally of 160%. That said, not all indicators are bullish. Rising ETH exchange reserves continue to raise concerns about potential sell pressure from holders. At press time, ETH is trading at $1,457, down 8.3% over the past 24 hours.

Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin has continued to outperform the Nasdaq on every major timeframe over the past week, month, year-to-date, and decade, Sigel said. “While slower economic growth alone is not bullish for Bitcoin, the policy response could be,” Sigel explained. “If tariffs put pressure on GDP without triggering a new round of inflation, the Fed may have room to cut interest rates, creating the liquidity conditions that Bitcoin has historically excelled at.” Related News: JUST IN: FED Minutes Released - Here's All You Need to Know According to VanEck, China and Russia have started using Bitcoin and other digital assets for some cross-border energy transactions. Additionally, Bolivia announced plans to import electricity using cryptocurrency, and French utility giant EDF is reportedly exploring the feasibility of mining Bitcoin using surplus electricity currently exported to Germany. “These are early signs that Bitcoin is transforming from a speculative asset to a functional monetary instrument, particularly in economies looking to ditch the dollar and reduce exposure to U.S.-led financial systems,” Sigel said. Sigel advised investors to keep a close eye on US Federal Reserve policy, noting that dovish shifts in interest rate expectations and increased liquidity have historically supported Bitcoin’s performance. Sigel also pointed to the US Dollar Index (DXY) as a key indicator: “Continued weakness in the dollar could support the narrative that Bitcoin is being used as a hedge, especially in an environment of geopolitical fragmentation.” *This is not investment advice.

Now, the upper chamber is set to hold a final vote on Atkins as soon as this evening. This vote reduces discussion and speeds up the decision-making process. 🚨NEW: The Senate has voted (51-45) to proceed with a vote on Paul Atkins' nomination to the @SECGov . The upper chamber is now set to move forward with a final vote on Atkins potentially as soon as this evening. https://t.co/nBy51u1t7N — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) April 9, 2025 Mark Uyeda has been the acting head of the SEC up until now. During his time in charge, the commission has been friendlier to crypto. Some of the things that have brought excitement to the crypto community are the settlement of the well-known Ripple case. He also eased the agency’s usual tough enforcement style. However, since Atkins is confirmed, Uyeda’s time as acting chairman is almost up. To investors, it will be the start of a new era for SEC policy and direction. The crypto community’s expectations Atkins has a lot of experience with how regulations work because he was an SEC commissioner from 2002 to 2008. Investors see him as a pro-innovation and market-friendly person. Unlike his predecessor, Gary Gensler, who was strict on compliance, he is likely to be more flexible with digital assets. This is because he leads the consulting business Patomak Global Partners, which he started in 2009. According to its website, the firm’s clients include banks, crypto exchanges, and DeFi platforms. Atkins was a SEC commissioner, he pushed for policies that were good for the market and meant to boost economic growth. Atkins has a reputation as a proponent of deregulation in financial markets. Many industry experts expect his leadership to prioritize reducing bureaucratic hurdles for companies while fostering innovation in the financial sector. However, others are worried that deregulation could make the market less stable. Clearly, Trump is doing enough with new regulations that include tariffs and Musk’s DOGE, whichhave left the US unstable and close to a recession. Therefore, promising change for Americans is no longer exciting. His policy could show that the SEC is moving toward finding a balance between new technologies and protecting investors. It has been a tough line for the agency to walk in recent years. This means that the way financial oversight works will change a lot because of his selection, especially when it comes to crypto. Crypto users are very positive about what Atkins’ appointment could mean for upcoming crypto investment vehicles, such as the XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin ETFs. The new leadership could speed up the process of making rules clearer for these products. This could bring more institutional capital into the sector. Dems find fault on Paul Atkins Paul Atkins said that making rules for digital assets is a top priority during last week’s meeting to discuss the nominations. On the previous panel on Thursday morning, the votes were 13 to 11. This allowed the nomination to move forward. However, all eleven Democrats on the committee were against it. Top Democrat Sen. Elizabeth Warren pushed back against Atkins at that meeting because of his ties to the now collapsed crypto exchange FTX and President Trump’s possible conflicts of interest with the rise of his memecoin. Several news outlets, including The Wall Street Journa l, say that FTX was a client of Patomak Global Partners and that Patomak Global Partners became an assistant to FTX in early 2022. At the end of 2022, FTX filed for bankruptcy. In November 2023, Sam Bankman-Fried, the CEO of the exchange, was found guilty of seven criminal charges. Warren said, “He [Atkins] has spent his post-government career helping billionaire scammers like CEO Sam Bankman-Fried get even richer.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

This pushed the price of Bitcoin up to $82,350.37, according to CoinGecko. Earlier in the day, the price had dropped as low as $74,567.02 when the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield temporarily spiked above 4.51%. Source: TradingView The pause in tariffs triggered a full-blown rally across stocks and crypto. The Dow Jones Industrial Average logged its biggest one-day gain in five years. Tech stocks exploded. Tesla, one of the top gainers, climbed 20%, recovering losses it had racked up since the start of 2025 due to CEO Elon Musk’s public alignment with the Trump administration. Robinhood was up 23%. Crypto exchange Coinbase gained 20%, and MicroStrategy, which recently rebranded to Strategy, rocketed 25%. Trump wrote in his post that he had “authorized a 90 day PAUSE, and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of 10%, also effective immediately.” He added that after this temporary pause, the tariff on China would rise to 125%. That post lit up both traditional markets and the crypto sector. The NASDAQ rallied as traders poured into tech stocks that had been dumped in recent months. Tesla stood out. The company had taken a beating over the past few months as Musk inserted himself into global politics despite not being an elected official. With the tariff freeze in place, investors went risk-on again. Even with the sharp jump, Bitcoin is still down roughly 25% from its all-time high in January. Since last Thursday, the coin has been reacting closely to the equities market. As traders look for more signs of direction on trade policy, Bitcoin has dropped about 5% over the past week, matching the losses seen across major stock indexes. Goldman, Ackman react to tariff pause as volatility shifts Zach Pandl, head of research at Grayscale Investments, told CNBC that short-term moves in Bitcoin will likely stay linked to tech stocks, but long-term investors should think beyond that. He said portfolios should be positioned for “sustained dollar weakness and generally above-target inflation,” since past trade conflicts in the U.S. often ended that way. Not long after Trump made the announcement, hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman reacted with a post on X, saying, “Thank you on behalf of all Americans.” In a follow-up, he praised Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent with the message, “[Scott] rocks!” Ackman’s comments came just as crypto and equities were exploding across the board. Goldman Sachs also changed direction. The bank had sent out a note just 30 minutes before Trump’s post, forecasting a 65% chance of recession and a 1% drop in GDP for the year. But right after the White House announcement, the forecast flipped. Goldman dropped its recession odds to 45% and now expects 0.5% GDP growth instead. Jan Hatzius, Goldman’s chief economist, told clients the newly announced tariffs still line up with their previous prediction of a 15-point rise in the effective tariff rate. He said the firm expects more sector-specific tariffs in the future. “We think the White House is unlikely to quickly reverse most of the new tariffs,” Hatzius added. But he also pointed out that Goldman’s recession forecast would drop again if the administration rolls back additional measures. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Crypto exchange Bybit is recovering from the largest hack in crypto history, which resulted in a $1.6 billion loss. In a research report by Block Scholes, commissioned by Bybit, the analytics firm outlined the nature of the crash and the platform’s subsequent recovery. Following the hack, Bybit’s market share dropped from 10% in January 2025 to just 4%. However, according to the report, that figure rebounded to 7% within weeks. At the same time, both trading volumes and order book depth, the quantity of orders at different price levels, quickly stabilized. “While the hack triggered a sharp but brief disruption in volumes and order book depth — particularly in the BTC and ETH markets — bid-ask spreads across major tokens remained largely intact,” the report noted. The bid-ask spread, or the difference between the seller’s and buyer’s prices, stayed tight on Bybit despite the decline in volumes. This suggests that market makers remained active, contributing to an efficient market even in the wake of the incident. Bybit’s retail focus helps in recovery The report also attributes part of Bybit’s recovery to the launch of Retail Price Improvement (known as RPI) orders. These orders are available only to retail traders using the app and are not accessible to institutions or trading bots. This approach aims to level the playing field for individual investors. The feature proved popular. Bybit’s 3-stall liquidity, a measure of near-the-market liquidity, was significantly higher for RPI orders than for regular orders. This helped the exchange maintain tight spreads for retail and manual traders. BTCUSDT spot 3-stall liquidity by order type, RPI and non-RPI, from Feb 24–Apr 1, 2025 | Source: Bybit According to the report, RPI orders played a key role in stabilizing liquidity, marking the first step in Bybit’s efforts to reclaim its share of the spot crypto trading market.

While short-term price movement is positive, Dogecoin languishes at 80% below its all-time high but one analyst thinks a rebound is in the offing Dogecoin Price Can Set A New All-Time High Dogecoin price has surged by 10.30% over the last day after a shoddy showing over the previous seven days. The sudden resurgence in prices comes amid a slew of macroeconomic uncertainties nevertheless, the surge is stoking enthusiasm that DOGE can set a new all-time high. Cryptocurrency analyst Master Kenobi revealed on X that the bottom is in for DOGE and a rally is in the offing for the asset. He opines that Dogecoin price will surpass $0.73 in the coming months hinting at a push to $1. The predicted price movement will see DOGE surpass the previous ATH that it set in 2021. “It’s only upward from here,” said Master Kenobi. “A new ATH for DOGE by early June.” Despite trading at 80% less than its ATH, Dogecoin’s price has several positives going for it. For starters, a Dogecoin ETP by 21Shares and House of Doge is in the works and could send prices on a strong rally. Furthermore, Dogecoin has weathered reports of Elon Musk leaving DOGE to reach what analysts like Master Kenobi are calling the bottom. A Bounce Back Will Face A Series Of Bumps While there is consensus for a Dogecoin price rally, several factors are standing in the way of a bounce back. First, Dogecoin whales have dumped 1.3 billion DOGE sparking worries of concerted sell pressure from heavy hitters. Furthermore, the DOGE transaction count has taken a major hit, dropping by 94% over the last month. The transaction count decline is stoking fears of a steep plunge in Dogecoin price as demand for the memecoin reaches an all-time low. Bitcoin’s price crashes continue to have a negative impact on DOGE with top crypto dragging other altcoins underwater. The broader macroeconomic uncertainty is poised to affect cryptocurrency prices with China and the EU announcing retaliatory tariffs against the US.

However, certain cryptocurrencies show promise even in these tough times. This article delves into the short-term prospects of JasmyCoin and Ethena , revealing intriguing opportunities for potential gains. Discover the coins that might be poised for growth despite market challenges, promising to captivate even the most cautious investor. JasmyCoin Faces Decline with Key Support Zones for a Potential Reversal JasmyCoin experienced a marked decline, with a one-month drop of about 23% and a six-month loss nearing 44%. The price range settled between $0.007 and $0.0175. A weekly loss of roughly 7% underscores consistent downward pressure. Past performance reflects continuous bearish action without strong counter moves. Current price action shows immediate support near $0.0034 and resistance around $0.0244, with a secondary resistance at $0.0349. Bearish signals dominate as the RSI lingers below 40 and other momentum indicators remain weak. Traders may watch for a break above resistance to hint at a possible reversal, but caution is advised within these clear levels. Ethena Shows Sharp Drops Amid Hints of Long-Term Recovery Over the past month, Ethena dropped around 34.55% with a weekly decline close to 25.37%. The six-month trend indicates a modest increase of 1.27%. This price history shows significant short-term weakness, alongside a slight recovery over a longer period. Volatility plays a major role as the coin fluctuates between quick drops and slow rebounds. Currently, the price trades between approximately $0.29 and $0.44. Immediate resistance is identified at $0.53, while support is around $0.24. A secondary resistance level exists at $0.68, with lower support near $0.09. Bearish momentum is prevalent, indicated by negative moving averages and oscillator readings. Traders may consider buying near support and seeking profit as prices approach resistance, noting the absence of a clear trend. Conclusion JASMY offers short-term gains due to its strong community and recent technological updates. ENA shows promise with its unique approach in the crypto space. Both coins provide opportunities to earn even during a market downturn. They present potential for traders looking for quick returns.

Facing tough resistance over the past week, the price may break through if the buying volume increases. Pendle’s daily outlook remains bearish on the short-term scale, although it has been on the bulls’ radar since it bounced off $1.8 last month. Registering a notable gain so far, the bounce has brought a suspense in the bearish momentum but faced resistance amid the recent recovery. It lost buzz and fell, but later, closed strong last month after rebounding. Things later got uglier as it encountered resistance, and it closed at a loss in the first week of this month. Leading to Monday’s crash, which plummeted most altcoins to a new low, Pendle witnessed a slight drop but managed to stay well above the $2.4 level and traded back in a consolidation phase. Yesterday came with a major recovery as most altcoins painted greens. It unfortunately posted losses and remained weak as it formed a bearish bar. This came as a result of selling volume. Volatility increased today, and the token is now posting gains daily. A push above the previous resistance level should rally the price to a new monthly high. Such a rally should activate the double-bottom formation, a new bullish pattern on the 4-hour chart. Inversely, it may resume crack down if the bears retake last month’s low. Pendle’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview The $2.4 level is still holding as support. If it collapses, the lower level to consider for drops would be $2.1, followed by $1.8 – last month’s low. Moving higher, the bulls must surpass the $3.32 resistance level. If they succeed, the higher levels for an increase are located at $3.8, 44.4 and $5.26.

Crypto strategist Rekt Capital tells his 542,6000 followers on the social media platform X that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) – a technical indicator that signals when an asset’s momentum is due to reverse course – suggests Bitcoin may hold $70,000 as support. Says Rekt, “Whenever Bitcoin’s Daily RSI crashed into the sub-28 RSI levels that wouldn’t necessarily mark out the price bottom. In fact, historically, the actual price bottom would be -0.32% to -8.44% lower than the price when the RSI first bottomed. Bitcoin is currently forming its second low -2.79% below the first low. A repeat of -8.44% below the first low would see price bottom at ~$70,000.” Source: Rekt Capital/YouTube The analyst also says that the first signs of a possible bullish reversal for Bitcoin would be when the flagship crypto asset breaks and holds resistance at $78,550. “ Bitcoin has failed to retest the red $78,550 March lows and it’s possible these lows may figure as new resistance in the future. For price to adopt bullish bias, it would need to reclaim these lows as support to then challenge the downtrend (green).” Source: Rekt Capital/YouTube The analyst also notes that Bitcoin has entered a trading volume gap on the weekly chart around $70,000, further suggesting that BTC needs to retest that level. “Bitcoin is experiencing downside continuation after upside wicking into the early March weekly lows (red). Having confirmed this red level as new resistance, BTC is now dropping into the $71,000-$83,000 volume gap to fill this market inefficiency.” Source: Rekt Capital/YouTube Bitcoin is trading for $77,500 at time of writing, down 1% in the last 24 hours.

Downing argued that Gensler’s approach stifled U.S. fintech leadership and contributed to the rise of meme coins. The SEC, under new leadership during the Trump administration, has moved away from aggressive enforcement, dropping several high-profile crypto lawsuits as lawmakers now push for clear congressional regulation. Congressman Troy Downing (R-MT) lambasted former United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler for “a lack of guidance” and “hostility” toward digital assets in the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services hearing on Wednesday. Congressman Troy Downing Shares His Take In the April 9 hearing , Downing slammed the former SEC head for being “more focused on waging an ideological crusade against an industry he fundamentally distrusted” than bolstering an environment for innovation stateside.

Downing further shifted responsibility for the rise of meme coins in the U.S. to Gensler, effectively claiming that his decision to not work with the digital asset sector led to their rise. “Meme coins are a product of the Gensler SEC and its failure to the digital asset industry with clear guidelines on what makes a digital asset a security,” he said. SEC Shifts Course Under New Administration Led by Subcommittee Chairman Bryan Steil (WI-01), Wednesday’s hearing covered the implication of U.S. securities law in digital assets, current crypto regulations, and potential solutions via congressional legislation. The SEC has seen a paradigm shift in leadership under the Trump administration, with the federal regulator moving away from its regulation-by-enforcement approach to digital assets . In recent months, the government agency has dropped litigation against several key players in the crypto industry, including Kraken, OpenSea, and Coinbase. U.S. President Donald Trump largely campaigned on enacting crypto-friendly regulations, though his recent tariff policies have prompted turbulence across both traditional and digital markets.

Now, as trade tensions escalate and US Treasurys face sell-offs, some analysts believe China may be actively working to weaken the US dollar. This added pressure on the dollar heightens the likelihood that it could once again serve as a catalyst for another major Bitcoin rally. Is China working to weaken the US dollar? According to an April 9 Reuters report, China's central bank has instructed state-owned lenders to ""reduce dollar purchases"" as the yuan faces significant downward pressure. Large banks were reportedly ""told to step up checks when executing dollar purchase orders for their clients,"" signaling an effort to ""curb speculative trades."" Some analysts have speculated whether China might be attempting to weaken the dollar in response to recent US import tariff increases. However, Jim Bianco, president of Bianco Research, holds a different view. Source: X/Jim Bianco Bianco doubts that China is selling US Treasurys with the intent of harming the US economy. He points out that the DXY has remained steady around the 102 level. While China could sell bonds without converting the proceeds into other currencies—thereby impacting the bond market without destabilizing the dollar—this approach seems counterproductive. According to Bianco, it is unlikely that China is a significant seller of Treasurys, if it is selling them at all. US Dollar Index (DXY). Source: TradingView / Cointelegraph The DXY Index remains close to the 104 level seen on March 9 and has consistently stayed within the 100-110 range since November 2022. Therefore, claims that its current level reflects widespread distrust in the US dollar or signals an imminent collapse seem unfounded. In reality, stock market performance is not an accurate measure of investors’ risk perception regarding the economy. DXY below 100 is usually followed by Bitcoin bull runs The last time the DXY Index fell below 100 was in June 2020, a period that coincided with a Bitcoin bull run. During those nine months, Bitcoin surged from $9,450 to $57,490. Similarly, when DXY dropped below 100 in mid-April 2017, Bitcoin’s price skyrocketed from $1,200 to $17,610 within eight months. Whether coincidental or not, the 100 level has historically aligned with significant Bitcoin price gains. A weakening DXY indicates that the US dollar has lost value against a basket of major currencies such as the euro, Swiss franc, British pound, and Japanese yen. This decline impacts US-based companies by reducing the amount of dollars they earn from foreign revenues, which in turn lowers tax contributions to the US government. This issue is particularly critical given that the US is running an annual deficit exceeding $1.8 trillion. Similarly, US imports for individuals and businesses become more expensive in dollar terms when the currency weakens, even if prices remain unchanged in foreign currencies. Despite being the world’s largest economy, the US imports $160 billion in oil, $215 billion in passenger vehicles, and $255 billion in computers, smartphones, data servers, and similar products annually. Related: China’s tariff response may mean more capital flight to crypto: Hayes A weaker US dollar has a dual negative impact on the economy. It tends to slow consumption as imports become more expensive, and it simultaneously reduces tax revenues from the international earnings of US-based companies. For example, more than 49% of revenues for major corporations like Microsoft, Apple, Tesla, Visa, and Meta come from outside the US. Similarly, companies such as Google and Nvidia derive an estimated 35% or more of their revenues internationally. Bitcoin’s price could potentially reclaim the $82,000 level regardless of movements in the DXY Index. This could happen as investors grow concerned about potential liquidity injections from the US Federal Reserve to stave off an economic recession . However, if the DXY Index falls below 100, investors may find stronger incentives to turn to alternative hedge instruments like Bitcoin.

Pseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 317,700 followers on the social media platform X that he believes the Ethereum ( ETH ) challenger looks ripe for a significant bounce after losing about 64% of its value from its all-time high of $293, which it hit in January of this year. According to Bluntz, SOL is flashing a bullish divergence on the daily chart, a reversal signal suggesting that buying momentum is on the up and up even though an asset’s price continues to fall or move sideways. “Started bidding some names for bounces today, a lot of bull divs printed on names like SOL, HYPE + many more that have basically gone down -70%+ in a straight line even on large caps. Definitely do not subscribe to the idea that this is ‘THE BOTTOM’, but sizable bounces are highly likely in my opinion.” Source: Bluntz/X Bluntz also thinks that Solana will outperform Bitcoin ( BTC ) when the market catches a bid. According to the trader, the Solana versus Bitcoin (SOL/BTC) chart appears to have completed an ABC correction on the weekly chart, suggesting that the pair may have printed a local bottom. “SOL/BTC doesn’t look horrid anymore, in my opinion. Finally, at a buyable zone.” Source: Bluntz/X Bluntz uses the Elliott Wave theory in their analysis, which states that an asset tends to witness a five-wave rally after completing an ABC correction. At time of writing, SOL/BTC is valued at 0.00139 BTC, worth $105.

The release includes a corporate Bitcoin holdings dashboard and a BTC-to-USD real-time price quote API, now available for all companies and developers via Block’s public GitHub repository under the Block Open Source initiative. As Bitcoin adoption grows among institutional treasuries, businesses are seeking better tools to track and report their holdings. Block’s new dashboard directly addresses these needs, offering real-time visibility, simplicity, and adaptability. The dashboard aims to help companies monitor the dollar value of their Bitcoin holdings through a user-friendly interface designed for both finance teams and executives. It integrates real-time pricing data via an open source BTC/USD quote API, with future plans for quarter-end historical lookup features to support financial reporting. Block has invited feedback and feature requests from the open source community via GitHub Issues. Block further highlighted that companies are increasingly turning to Bitcoin for a variety of strategic reasons: Diversification: Adding Bitcoin alongside traditional treasury assets. Ecosystem support: Demonstrating alignment with Bitcoin innovation, particularly for crypto-forward businesses. Inflation hedge : Serving as a store of value in the face of fiat currency devaluation. Portfolio optimization: Aiming to enhance risk-adjusted returns. The first working prototype of the dashboard was created by non-engineers using Block’s internal open source AI agent, called codename goose . The AI agent enabled non-technical teams to prototype tools rapidly, with engineers from Block’s Bitcoin Platform team joining later to finalize development. Codename goose also contributed to front-end development via automated coding assistance. Block has long been a corporate leader in Bitcoin investment. Its Bitcoin Investment Memo from October 2020 and its Bitcoin Blueprint for Corporate Balance Sheets laid the foundation for businesses entering the crypto space. Block said it continues to purchase Bitcoin through a monthly dollar-cost averaging (DCA) program and updates its dashboard quarterly after earnings reports. Its live Bitcoin treasury dashboard can be viewed here . With this release, Block emphasized that it aims to empower other companies to manage Bitcoin on their balance sheets more confidently and transparently, further accelerating mainstream adoption of the world’s leading digital asset.

As the cryptocurrency market experiences high volatility due to Trump tariffs, Solana’s price has remained resilient despite recent selling pressure. Solana Whale Activity and Market Sentiment In the past few days, there has been a lot of whale movement affecting Solana’s price. On April 9, Whale Alert revealed the transfer of 1,030,000 SOL tokens equivalent to $110 million from Kraken exchange to an unidentified wallet. The market’s recent movement traces back to President Donald Trump halting tariffs , which revived Solana, Bitcoin, XRP, Ethereum, and Shiba Inu, registering more than a 10% rally. These large-scale transactions have impacted Solana’s price volatility. Due to whales selling of SOL tokens, the prices continue to drop significantly. Another tweet from LookOnChain highlighted that a large-scale whale nicknamed “4W1Ree” has unstaked 159,028 SOL, a move equivalent to $16.5 million. This, together with other large transfers, has been stressing the near-term stability of the coin. SOL Price Technical Indicators Point to Key Levels Solana’s price daily chart shows that the cryptocurrency is following an expanding falling-channel pattern, with the price recently dipping to $95.16 on April 7. This movement met with buying activity below the $100 mark, which has helped maintain Solana’s position above this psychological level. Several important levels have emerged that can be considered the main points of attraction for traders and analysts. According to Ali Charts, the current level of support is present at the $74 and $50 level while the first level of resistance is at the $115 level and another level of resistance at $121. If Solana can hold above the $95 level, a reversal to these areas of resistance may occur. Analysts are particularly watching for a break above $121, as this could signal a more significant price recovery. On the other hand, if the SOL price falls below $95 , further downside could be possible, with targets as low as $69.94. Outlook for Solana Price in April 2025 As Solana price navigates the challenges of whale sell-offs and market uncertainty, analysts remain cautiously optimistic about its potential . The cryptocurrency’s ability to maintain a foothold above $100 has garnered attention, with some believing that the coin could regain momentum if key resistance levels are broken. According to the prediction market, Polymarket, in April, the price of Solana will drop to $80 according to 20% of participants, while 30% predicted a surge to $150. This reflects the volatility normally associated with the short-term performance of the cryptocurrency. Nevertheless, there are bullish signs that the bulls are still intact and that the Solana price may be due for a surge if it can break past the current resistance.

43137203,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=147856,1744229435,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Crypto Crackdown: Thailand Approves Tougher Laws on Scams & Foreign Platforms,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/thailand-crypto-crackdown-laws/,"In a bold move to safeguard digital asset users and combat the rising tide of crypto-related cybercrime, Thailand has just given a significant thumbs-up to tougher crypto regulations . The Thai cabinet’s recent approval of amendments to existing emergency decrees signals a decisive shift towards enhanced consumer protection and a more secure digital asset landscape. Are you concerned about crypto scams? Thailand is taking action, and here’s what you need to know. Why the Urgent Need for Crypto Regulations in Thailand ? Thailand, like many nations globally, has witnessed a surge in cryptocurrency adoption. However, this growth has unfortunately been accompanied by a parallel rise in sophisticated crypto scams and illicit activities. Unsuspecting individuals have fallen victim to fraudulent schemes, losing significant amounts of money. The existing legal framework, while present, was deemed insufficient to effectively tackle these evolving threats. This urgent situation necessitated a robust overhaul of the regulations, leading to the recent amendments. The key drivers behind these urgent regulatory changes include: Escalating Crypto Scams: Thailand has seen a noticeable increase in various types of crypto scams, ranging from Ponzi schemes disguised as high-yield investments to sophisticated phishing attacks targeting digital wallets. Proliferation of Mule Accounts: Scammers often utilize mule accounts – accounts opened by individuals, sometimes unknowingly or under coercion, to launder illicit funds. These accounts obscure the trail of illegal activities, making it harder to trace and prosecute criminals. Rise of Foreign P2P Platforms: The increasing popularity of foreign crypto peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms operating within Thailand’s borders, often without proper oversight, has presented challenges in regulatory enforcement and consumer protection. Cybercrime Prevention: The broader context of cybercrime, which increasingly intersects with the digital asset space, demands stronger preventative measures and more stringent penalties. What are the Key Changes in Digital Asset Laws Thailand ? The approved amendments introduce several crucial changes designed to fortify the regulatory framework for digital assets in Thailand. Let’s break down the most significant updates: Feature Old Regulation (Simplified) New Regulation (Amendments) Impact Target General cybercrime and digital asset businesses Specifically crypto scams , mule accounts, and foreign P2P crypto platforms Sharper focus on emerging threats in the crypto space. Penalties Existing cybercrime penalties Up to $8,700 fine and/or 3 years imprisonment for violations related to mule accounts and unauthorized foreign P2P crypto platforms . Significantly increased penalties to deter illegal activities. Reporting Obligations General reporting requirements for digital asset businesses Mandatory reporting of suspicious transactions by crypto service providers. Enhanced surveillance and early detection of potentially fraudulent activities. Account Suspension Limited provisions for account suspension Authority for crypto service providers to suspend accounts linked to scams. Faster response to freeze and prevent further losses from scam-related accounts. Tougher Stance on Foreign P2P Crypto Platforms : What Does it Mean? A particularly noteworthy aspect of these new regulations is the stricter approach towards foreign P2P crypto platforms operating within Thailand. While the specifics are still unfolding, the intent is clear: to bring these platforms under closer scrutiny and ensure they comply with Thai laws. This could involve: Registration Requirements: Foreign platforms may be required to register with Thai regulatory bodies to operate legally in the country. Compliance with AML/KYC: Stricter enforcement of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations to prevent illicit fund flows through these platforms. Potential Restrictions: In cases of non-compliance, Thai authorities may impose restrictions on the operation of foreign P2P crypto platforms , potentially even blocking access for Thai users. For Thai crypto users, this could mean a shift in the landscape of available platforms. It’s crucial to stay informed about which platforms are operating legally and comply with the new regulations to avoid any disruptions or legal issues. Impact and Actionable Insights for Crypto Users in Thailand These new crypto regulations in Thailand are poised to have a multifaceted impact. Here’s a breakdown of the potential consequences and actionable steps for crypto users: Benefits: Enhanced Security: The primary benefit is increased security and reduced risk of falling victim to crypto scams . Greater Consumer Protection: Users will have more recourse and protection against fraudulent activities within the digital asset space. Cleaner Crypto Ecosystem: Crackdown on mule accounts and illicit platforms can contribute to a more transparent and legitimate crypto market in Thailand. Challenges: Platform Adjustments: Users may need to adjust to changes in the availability and operation of foreign P2P crypto platforms . Increased Compliance Burden: Crypto service providers will face a higher compliance burden, which could potentially translate to increased operational costs. Potential for Over-Regulation: There’s always a risk that stringent regulations could stifle innovation if not carefully balanced. Actionable Insights: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of the evolving regulatory landscape in Thailand. Follow official announcements from Thai regulatory bodies and reputable crypto news sources. Choose Compliant Platforms: Opt for crypto platforms that are registered and compliant with Thai regulations. Verify their legal status before using their services. Be Vigilant Against Scams: Exercise extreme caution and skepticism when encountering investment opportunities, especially those promising unrealistically high returns. Never share your private keys or sensitive information. Report Suspicious Activity: If you encounter or suspect any fraudulent activity, report it immediately to the relevant authorities and your crypto service provider. Conclusion: A Tougher , Safer Crypto Future for Thailand? Thailand’s proactive stance in enacting tougher crypto regulations is a significant step towards creating a more secure and trustworthy digital asset environment. While the full impact of these changes will unfold over time, the message is clear: Thailand is committed to combating crypto cybercrime Thailand and protecting its citizens from scams. By focusing on mule accounts, foreign P2P crypto platforms , and enhancing reporting mechanisms, these new laws aim to build a foundation for sustainable and responsible growth of the crypto industry in the nation. For crypto users in Thailand, staying informed, vigilant, and choosing compliant platforms will be key to navigating this evolving landscape and benefiting from a potentially safer digital asset future.
