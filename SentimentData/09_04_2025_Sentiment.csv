The digital currency world never ceases to amaze, and this time, it’s Binance Alpha making headlines with a rather…unconventional listing. According to recent reports surfacing from the Binance app itself and highlighted by Odaily News, Binance Alpha has apparently launched support for a cryptocurrency that goes by the name of Retard Finder Coin (RFC) . Yes, you read that right. In a move that has left many scratching their heads and the crypto-sphere buzzing with questions, this seemingly obscure coin has found its way onto a platform associated with the global giant, Binance. Let’s dive into what we know so far and what this intriguing development might mean for the future of altcoin listings and the ever-evolving landscape of crypto trading. What Exactly is Binance Alpha and Why Does This Listing Matter? Before we delve deeper into the specifics of Retard Finder Coin (RFC) , it’s crucial to understand the platform in question: Binance Alpha . While details about Binance Alpha are still emerging, it appears to be a distinct entity or perhaps a specialized section within the broader Binance ecosystem. It’s not the main Binance exchange that most users are familiar with, but rather something more niche, possibly focused on newer or higher-risk crypto projects. This distinction is important because listings on Binance Alpha might carry different implications than a listing on the main Binance platform. It could suggest a testing ground for emerging altcoins , a platform for more speculative trading, or a separate initiative altogether. Why does this listing matter? Well, any association with the Binance brand carries significant weight in the crypto world. Binance is a behemoth, and even a listing on a subsidiary platform like Binance Alpha can bring attention, volume, and potentially, legitimacy to a previously unknown altcoin . For Retard Finder Coin (RFC) , this listing, regardless of the platform’s exact nature, is a major development. Increased Visibility: Being listed on a platform associated with Binance instantly puts RFC on the radar of a massive global audience of crypto traders and investors. Potential for Liquidity: A listing often brings increased trading volume and liquidity, making it easier for people to buy and sell the coin. Credibility Boost (of sorts): While the name itself is…unconventional, the Binance association can lend a degree of perceived credibility, at least in the short term. Retard Finder Coin (RFC): Decoding the Unconventional Name Let’s address the elephant in the room – the name: Retard Finder Coin (RFC) . In a world where crypto projects often strive for sophisticated and tech-forward names, RFC stands out for its sheer audacity and…well, frankly, its controversial nature. The term “retard” is considered offensive and derogatory in many contexts, and its use in the name of a cryptocurrency is bound to raise eyebrows and spark debate. One can only speculate on the intentions behind this name. Is it meant to be ironic? A deliberate attempt to be provocative and generate buzz? A misguided attempt at humor? Or perhaps, a cultural or linguistic nuance lost in translation? Whatever the reason, the name is undeniably attention-grabbing, and in the crowded world of altcoins , standing out – even for controversial reasons – can sometimes be a strategy. However, it’s crucial to consider the potential downsides of such a name: Reputational Risk: The offensive nature of the name could deter serious investors and damage the coin’s long-term prospects. Regulatory Scrutiny: Authorities might take a dim view of a cryptocurrency with a name that could be considered offensive or discriminatory. Community Backlash: The crypto community, while often embracing memes and humor, may find the name distasteful and reject the project. Could this be a meme coin? Given the name, it’s tempting to categorize RFC as just another meme coin, designed for short-term hype and speculation. However, the Binance Alpha listing adds a layer of complexity. Binance, even on a subsidiary platform, typically conducts some level of due diligence before listing a coin. This suggests there might be more to RFC than just a provocative name. Or perhaps, Binance Alpha is taking a more experimental approach to listings, willing to embrace higher-risk, higher-reward projects, even those with controversial branding. The Crypto Listing Announcement: What We Know and What’s Missing The news of the crypto listing of Retard Finder Coin (RFC) on Binance Alpha is currently based on reports originating from the Binance app itself, as highlighted by Odaily News. However, crucial details remain shrouded in mystery. The announcement, as it stands, is rather barebones. Here’s what we know based on the current information: Listing Platform: Binance Alpha is the platform where RFC is reportedly listed. Source of Information: The information comes from the Binance app and was reported by Odaily News. And here’s what we are still waiting to learn: Trading Pairs: Which cryptocurrencies or fiat currencies will RFC be paired with for trading? (e.g., RFC/USDT, RFC/BTC). Trading Start Date and Time: When will trading officially commence? Deposit and Withdrawal Details: When will users be able to deposit and withdraw RFC to and from the platform? Project Details: What is the underlying technology, purpose, or use case of Retard Finder Coin (RFC) ? What problem does it solve? What is its tokenomics? Binance Official Announcement: Has Binance itself issued an official announcement or blog post about this listing? Official confirmation from Binance would lend more credibility and detail to the news. The lack of these details leaves room for speculation and caution. Investors should approach this crypto listing with extreme caution until more information becomes available. It’s essential to conduct thorough research and understand the risks involved before considering investing in any altcoin , especially one with such limited publicly available information and a controversial name. Navigating the Altcoin Landscape: Is RFC a Gem or a Gamble? The altcoin market is a wild frontier. It’s a place where fortunes can be made and lost in the blink of an eye. Retard Finder Coin (RFC) , with its unconventional name and enigmatic nature, perfectly embodies the high-risk, high-reward potential of the altcoin space. Investing in altcoins , particularly newly listed ones, is inherently riskier than investing in established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Here’s a breakdown of the potential risks and rewards associated with investing in altcoins like RFC : Risks Potential Rewards High Volatility: Altcoins are often subject to extreme price swings. High Growth Potential: Some altcoins can experience explosive growth, delivering massive returns to early investors. Lack of Information: Information about new altcoins can be scarce and unreliable. Early Entry Advantage: Investing early in a promising altcoin can be incredibly lucrative if the project succeeds. Scams and Rug Pulls: The altcoin space is rife with scams and projects that fail to deliver on their promises. Technological Innovation: Some altcoins represent genuinely innovative technologies and solutions. Liquidity Issues: Newer altcoins may have limited liquidity, making it difficult to buy or sell large amounts without affecting the price. Community Driven Growth: Strong community support can drive the adoption and value of an altcoin . For Retard Finder Coin (RFC) specifically, the risks are amplified by the lack of information and the controversial name. It could be a high-risk gamble with the potential for significant gains if it gains traction, or it could just as easily be a flash in the pan, or worse, something less legitimate. What is the Future of RFC? Uncertainty and Speculation Abound Predicting the future of any cryptocurrency is a fool’s errand, and this is especially true for Retard Finder Coin (RFC) given the current information vacuum. Will RFC become the next big meme coin sensation? Will it fade into obscurity as quickly as it appeared? Will the controversial name ultimately be its downfall, or a strangely effective marketing ploy? At this point, it’s all speculation. The success or failure of RFC will likely depend on a number of factors, including: Community Response: How will the crypto community react to the name and the project? Will it be embraced as ironic and humorous, or rejected as offensive? Project Development: If there is a genuine project behind RFC , will the developers be able to build something of value and utility? Binance Alpha’s Intentions: What is Binance Alpha’s strategy with listing coins like RFC ? Are they embracing a more experimental approach to listings? Market Sentiment: The overall market sentiment towards altcoins and meme coins will also play a role. For now, Retard Finder Coin (RFC) remains an enigma. The Binance Alpha listing has undoubtedly put it on the map, but its future trajectory is anyone’s guess. Investors should exercise extreme caution, conduct thorough due diligence if more information emerges, and remember the golden rule of crypto investing: never invest more than you can afford to lose. Conclusion: The Crypto World Keeps Surprising Us The Binance Alpha listing of Retard Finder Coin (RFC) is a stark reminder of the unpredictable and often bizarre nature of the cryptocurrency world. It highlights the constant influx of new altcoins , the power of exchange listings to generate buzz, and the enduring fascination with meme culture within the crypto space. Whether RFC is a fleeting curiosity or something more substantial remains to be seen. For now, it serves as a captivating case study in the ever-evolving and often surprising world of digital currencies. Keep your eyes peeled for further updates, but remember to approach with caution and a healthy dose of skepticism. The crypto rollercoaster continues its wild ride!

43096996,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=147535,1744153230,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Unwavering Stance: Trump Rules Out Near-Term Tariff Relief, USTR Confirms",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-tariff-stance-no-relief/,"In a move that’s likely to send ripples across global markets, including the ever-volatile cryptocurrency sphere, former U.S. President Donald Trump has reportedly shut the door on any immediate tariff exemptions. This firm stance, relayed by U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, signals a continuation of potentially disruptive trade policies. But what does this mean for the global economy and, more specifically, for the crypto market we closely watch? Trump’s Unyielding Position on Tariffs: What’s the Message? According to a recent update from Walter Bloomberg on X, USTR Greer stated unequivocally that President Trump has ruled out any tariff exemptions in the foreseeable future. This announcement is not just a minor policy tweak; it’s a clear indication that the protectionist trade measures initiated during Trump’s previous term could be here to stay, or even intensify should he regain office. For businesses and investors worldwide, this news brings a renewed sense of uncertainty. Let’s break down what this could imply: No Immediate Relief for Businesses: Companies hoping for a reprieve from existing tariffs will likely need to brace for continued financial pressures. This could affect supply chains, pricing strategies, and overall profitability. Potential for Escalation: The lack of exemptions might be interpreted as a signal that the U.S. is prepared to maintain or even escalate trade tensions with its partners, potentially leading to retaliatory tariffs from other nations. Impact on Global Trade Flows: Sustained tariffs can disrupt established trade routes and patterns, forcing businesses to seek alternative sourcing and markets, often at increased costs and complexities. How Does Trump’s Trade Policy Impact the Global Economy? The global economy is a complex web of interconnected markets, and trade policies enacted by major players like the United States have far-reaching consequences. Trump’s decision to rule out tariff exemptions is a significant factor to consider when assessing the current and future health of the global economic landscape. Here’s a closer look at the potential impacts: Impact Area Potential Effects Inflation Tariffs can lead to higher import costs, which may be passed on to consumers in the form of increased prices for goods and services, contributing to inflationary pressures. Economic Growth Trade disputes and tariffs can dampen economic growth by increasing business costs, reducing investment, and creating uncertainty in the market. Supply Chains Tariffs can disrupt global supply chains, forcing companies to restructure their operations, potentially leading to inefficiencies and delays. Geopolitical Relations Aggressive trade policies can strain international relations and lead to trade wars, impacting diplomatic ties and global cooperation. USTR Greer’s Confirmation: What Does It Mean for US Trade Relations? The role of the United States Trade Representative ( USTR ) is crucial in shaping and implementing U.S. trade policy. Jamieson Greer’s confirmation that no tariff exemptions are on the horizon carries significant weight. It suggests a unified stance within the Trump administration on maintaining a hard line on trade . This could indicate: Policy Consistency: Greer’s statement reinforces the idea that Trump’s trade policies are not merely negotiating tactics but represent a fundamental shift in approach. Limited Negotiation Flexibility: The absence of exemptions signals reduced flexibility in trade negotiations, potentially making it harder to reach agreements with trading partners. Focus on Domestic Industry: This stance likely prioritizes the protection of domestic industries, even if it comes at the cost of potentially strained international trade relationships. Cryptocurrency and the Global Economic Uncertainty: Where Do Tariffs Fit In? You might be wondering, how do tariffs and trade policies relate to the cryptocurrency market? While not a direct link, the connection lies in the broader global economy and investor sentiment. Here’s how: Economic Uncertainty Fuels Crypto Interest: Periods of economic uncertainty, often triggered by events like trade disputes and tariff implementations, can increase investor interest in alternative assets like cryptocurrencies. Some view crypto as a hedge against traditional market volatility. Impact on Risk Appetite: Trade tensions can negatively impact overall market sentiment, leading to a decrease in risk appetite. While this might initially seem negative for crypto (a risk asset), it can also push investors towards assets perceived as uncorrelated or having different risk profiles than traditional stocks and bonds. Global Economic Outlook: Cryptocurrencies operate on a global scale. A weakened global economy due to trade wars can affect crypto adoption and investment flows across borders. Conversely, in some regions facing economic hardship exacerbated by trade issues, crypto might become more appealing as a means of value preservation or cross-border transactions. Navigating the Tariff Landscape: What Can Crypto Investors Watch For? While predicting the exact impact of tariffs on the crypto market is complex, staying informed and adaptable is key. Here are some actionable insights for crypto investors in light of these trade developments: Monitor Global Economic Indicators: Keep an eye on macroeconomic data, particularly indicators related to inflation, economic growth, and trade balances. These will provide clues about the broader economic impact of tariff policies. Track Geopolitical Developments: Pay attention to news and developments related to international trade relations and potential escalations of trade disputes. These events can significantly influence market sentiment. Diversify Your Portfolio: In times of economic uncertainty, diversification is crucial. Consider diversifying your crypto portfolio and also across different asset classes to mitigate risk. Stay Informed on Regulatory Responses: Governments and central banks may respond to trade-induced economic pressures with monetary or fiscal policies. Be aware of these responses as they can indirectly affect crypto markets. Conclusion: The Enduring Shadow of Tariffs on the Global Stage Trump’s firm stance on tariffs , as relayed by USTR Greer, injects a dose of reality into the global economic outlook. The message is clear: businesses and investors should not expect any near-term easing of trade pressures. For the cryptocurrency market, this development is another piece in the complex puzzle of global economic factors that can influence its trajectory. While the direct impact might be nuanced, the overarching theme of economic uncertainty and potential market volatility remains relevant. As we move forward, understanding these trade dynamics will be crucial for navigating the ever-evolving landscape of both traditional and digital finance.

But what exactly does that mean, and why should you be excited? Let’s break it down: Scalability for the Masses: Ethereum, while being the powerhouse of DeFi and NFTs, can get congested, leading to high gas fees and slow transaction times. This is a major hurdle for gaming, where quick and cost-effective transactions are crucial. ZKcandy, as a layer-2 scaling solution, operates on top of Ethereum, inheriting its security while drastically increasing transaction throughput and reducing costs. This means smoother gameplay and a better overall experience for gamers. Mobile-First Approach: ZKcandy is laser-focused on mobile gaming, a massive and rapidly growing market.

Unlocking the Potential of Layer-2 Scaling for Web3 Games Why is layer-2 scaling so critical for the future of Web3 gaming ?

Frustrating, right? This is where layer-2 solutions like ZKcandy step in to save the day. Here’s a table highlighting the key benefits of using layer-2 scaling for gaming: Benefit Description Impact on Gamers Lower Gas Fees Layer-2 networks bundle multiple transactions into a single transaction on the Ethereum mainnet, significantly reducing gas costs per user.

Ability to support complex and engaging games with vibrant economies and active player bases. Enhanced User Experience The combination of lower fees and faster transactions leads to a significantly better and more enjoyable gaming experience.

These initiatives are crucial for attracting both players and game developers to the platform. Token Incentives for Players: Rewarding players with tokens for participating in the ecosystem can drive user adoption and engagement. This could involve earning tokens through gameplay, completing challenges, or contributing to the community. These incentives create a more rewarding and engaging gaming experience, encouraging players to become active participants in the ZKcandy ecosystem. Developer Grants for Game Creation: Offering grants to game developers to build on the ZKcandy platform is a powerful way to expand the game library and attract innovative projects. These grants can provide financial support and resources, encouraging developers to explore the possibilities of Web3 gaming on ZKcandy. This fosters innovation and ensures a continuous influx of fresh and exciting content for players. Challenges and the Road Ahead for ZKcandy While ZKcandy presents an exciting step forward for Ethereum L2 gaming , it’s important to acknowledge potential challenges and the journey ahead: Competition in the L2 and Gaming Space: The layer-2 scaling landscape is becoming increasingly competitive, with various solutions vying for adoption.

The court paused the U.S. Judge William Alsup of San Francisco’s March 13 injunction, which required six federal agencies to reinstate thousands of newly hired probationary employees while the legality of the dismissals was being challenged. In addition, Trump presented the case as just another example of the federal judiciary stepping in to manage the decisions it claimed the executive branch ought to have established. Trump administration secures partial victory In a short, unsigned ruling, the court declared that the nine nonprofit organizations that received an injunction in response to their lawsuit lacked the legal standing to sue. In addition, based on the court’s argument, other plaintiffs’ claims in the case were not addressed in its order. According to them, this did not form the basis of the district court’s preliminary injunction. However, Ketanji Brown Jackson and Sonia Sotomayor, both liberal justices, openly disagreed with the ruling. Jackson gave a brief explanation, raising concerns and questioning the need for the high court’s immediate intervention. Moreover, the full implications of the decision were unclear since a federal judge in Maryland issued a preliminary injunction earlier this month that reinstated some of the employees not covered in the Supreme Court case. According to Georgetown University Law Center professor and Supreme Court analyst Steve Vladeck, the decision was relatively limited. In support of this, Vladeck mentioned that the court only stated that the nonprofit groups granted an injunction in San Francisco were not the appropriate parties to challenge the mass firing in this case. He continued that Trump had won once more, but only in terms of who can and cannot sue and in which courts. Additionally, the Supreme Court analyst highlighted that the other challenges to the mass firings had already led to government losses in other cases, and those rulings were left in place. Even so, the decision was a victory for the Trump administration, which had asked the high court to intervene to wipe out the order from the lower court. This came after the court allowed the administration to carry out deportations under the controversial Alien Enemies Act but with some additional limitations. Trump administration’s firing strategy targeted probationary employees with fewer job protections As part of its effort to shrink the size of the federal government, Trump administration targeted probationary employees as part of its drive to reduce the size of the federal government because they have fewer job protections and are more easily fired. Normally, those workers could not appeal their firing to the Merit Systems Protection Board; however, they might be able to do so if the dismissal was due to “partisan political reasons” or “marriage status.” Furthermore, concerning the situation, labor unions and other organizations challenged the Office of Personnel Management’s role in the firing, which impacted thousands of workers and sent shockwaves through different federal agencies, some of which went on to rehire some of the affected employees. On the other hand, U.S. District Judge William Alsup mandated the administration that more than 16,000 probationary employees should be allowed to return to work immediately. In his opinion, Alsup stated that each agency had, and still has, discretion over the hiring and firing of its own employees. In this case, OPM directed the agencies to terminate all probationary staff, and they carried out that directive. Sarah Harris, the administration’s acting solicitor general at the time, told the Supreme Court that the district court’s incredibly broad remedy was causing the Executive Branch actual, irreversible harm that needed this Court’s quick intervention.

Per a report from the Russian state-run news agency TASS , the FTS has also “posted information” on crypto “exchange” rates for taxpayers. Russian Crypto Miners: Ready to Pay Taxes? The FTS tool lets miners check on the exact “minimum closing price” in fiat rubles of popular coins on “foreign trading [platforms]” ( crypto exchanges ) on specific dates in the period January 1, 2025, to March 31. The Federal Tax Service’s tax calculation tool shows the price of Bitcoin at specific periods on the Binance crypto exchange. (Source: Federal Tax Service/Screenshot) Quoting the FTS’ press service, TASS reported that the agency’s website “has published information on market quotes for digital currencies and total volumes of daily trades with foreign trade organizers for taxpayers.” This, the FTS said, will help “taxpayers” to “determine income from digital currency transactions based on information from open sources.” “This will help taxpayers calculate the tax base for digital currency transactions on each individual date of income recognition.” Russian Federal Tax Service A Russian Soyuz rocket carrying an American astronaut and two Russian cosmonauts blasted off from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan for the International Space Station, Russia's Roscosmos space agency said https://t.co/P57xmvV9Nk — Reuters (@Reuters) April 8, 2025 The FTS noted that “digital currency obtained as a result of mining” is considered as a taxable form of income. And it wrote that “the value of digital currency is determined based on market prices on the date of the actual receipt of income.” The FTS clarified that cryptoassets become income on “the day when the person who acquired them has the right to sell them.” The Federal Tax Service’s tax calculation tool shows the price of DOGE at specific periods on the OKX crypto exchange. (Source: Federal Tax Service/Screenshot) ‘Framework’ in Place The tool, however, appears to be somewhat imperfect. At the time of writing, it only carries data from seven crypto exchanges, including Binance, ByBit, KuCoin, and MEXC. And while it collates data on a wide range of popular coins, including Bitcoin (BTC) and Dogecoin (DOGE) , some high-cap coins like Ethereum (ETH) and XRP appear to be missing from its database. The FTS has also added disclaimers to its new resource, noting that the information it provides “is subject to independent verification by the taxpayer.” Russia has already “legalized” crypto mining. And in November 2024, President Vladimir Putin signed a law stipulating the creation of a “framework” for taxing crypto miners.

The November law stipulates that crypto-related trades are subject to a two-tiered level of income tax. Those with earnings of up to 2.4 million rubles ($28,000) must pay levies of 13% on their earnings. Anyone earning more than this will be obliged to pay 15%, with corporations ordered to pay the regular corporate tax rate (25%) on their earnings.

The Russian crypto mining industry has previously assured Moscow that the Treasury can expect to make over half a billion USD per year from taxing miners. The FTS’ new web resources also contain instructions for what it calls “mining infrastructure operators.” It defines these as individuals or companies who “provide services for the provision of mining infrastructure for the activities of miners and mining pools.” Russian crypto experts have previously claimed that nine out of 10 mining firms focus their efforts on BTC (although some data compilers dispute this claim). However, Russian crypto enthusiasts have previously told Cryptonews.com that many home-based miners prefer to mine ETH. All experts also agree that Litecoin (LTC) – which is included in the FTS’ database – also enjoys a minority interest among major domestic mining players.

The surge in interest comes as XRP’s legal battles with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are at their tail end, with new institutional-focused products emerging for the Ripple-associated coin. Teucrium’s X2 Daily Long XRP ETF Sees Strong Start On its first day of trading, the 2X Daily Long ETF saw a trading volume of $5 million. Teucrium launched this product after approval by NYSE Arca . According to Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas, this performance places it in the top 5% of new ETFs launched. This result is particularly impressive given the current market conditions. For context, a similar product, the Solana 2X ETF (SOLT) garnered a fraction of this volume, or about four times less than XRP’s debut. This impressive performance suggests investors are keen to leverage their positions on XRP. Balchunas further shared his thoughts on the debut, calling the $5 million in volume respectable considering the market conditions. He noted that this performance while outpacing Solana’s, comes with a twist. He said it pales compared to BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) whose debut volume topped $1 billion. Spot XRP ETF Prospect As reported by CoinGape, John Deaton reflects on the four-year Ripple lawsuit, stating that XRP’s status as a non-security is a crucial boost to the growing push for exchange-traded funds tied to the coin. The filing of multiple XRP ETFs remains a hot topic in the market. With $1.5 trillion in assets under management (AUM), investment giant Franklin Templeton recently filed for a Spot XRP ETF through the Cboe exchange. This adds to the growing list of firms pushing for XRP-related funds after Ripple Labs’ dropped its cross-appeal against the US SEC. Other prominent firms have also filed for similar offerings, including Grayscale’s spot XRP ETF listing push with the NYSE. This offering could potentially involve converting the former’s XRP Trust into a full-fledged ETF. With this momentum, XRP’s future looks promising, and more ETF applications are anticipated in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, in Brazil, the Hashdex spot XRP ETF has gained regulatory approval, with B3 as the exchange of choice. At the time, the XRP price jumped 6% following the update, a sign of positive sentiment around related products. This further solidifies the momentum around XRP’s potential as an investment asset in different regions around the world.

The economic landscape just shifted dramatically. In a move that has sent ripples through global markets, the White House has officially confirmed the implementation of a staggering 104% tariff on Chinese goods. This isn’t just a minor trade adjustment; it’s a full-blown escalation that could have profound implications across various sectors, including our beloved crypto space. Let’s dive into what this jaw-dropping development means for you and the future of digital assets. What Triggered These Shocking China Tariffs? According to a report by Walter Bloomberg, citing Fox Business on X, the White House Press Secretary made the announcement that this massive tariff took effect at noon ET. The catalyst? China’s failure to withdraw its retaliatory measures. This tit-for-tat trade dispute has been simmering for a while, but this latest move signifies a significant hardening of stances. The tariffs are slated to begin being collected on April 9th, giving businesses and markets a short window to brace for the impact. Here’s a quick breakdown of the key events leading to this point: Initial Trade Tensions: Long-standing trade imbalances and disputes over intellectual property have been a point of contention between the US and China for years. Retaliatory Measures: When one nation imposes tariffs, the other often responds in kind, creating a cycle of escalating trade barriers. Deadline for Withdrawal: The White House seemingly issued an ultimatum for China to withdraw its retaliatory measures, which was not met. 104% Tariff Implementation: As a result of China’s inaction, the US has now imposed a hefty 104% tariff on select Chinese goods. The Looming Trade War Impact on the Global Economy This isn’t just a bilateral issue; the implications of these China Tariffs reverberate across the entire global economy . A trade war of this magnitude can disrupt supply chains, increase inflation, and dampen economic growth worldwide. Here’s how: Impact Area Potential Consequences Supply Chains Disruptions as businesses scramble to find alternative sources for goods previously imported from China. Increased costs and delays are likely. Inflation Higher tariffs translate to increased costs for imported goods, which can be passed on to consumers, driving up inflation. Economic Growth Reduced trade and investment due to uncertainty and higher costs can slow down economic growth both in the US, China, and globally. Geopolitical Relations Escalating trade tensions can further strain US-China Relations , impacting diplomatic and political ties beyond just economics. For cryptocurrency investors, understanding these macroeconomic shifts is crucial. The crypto market, while often seen as independent, is still influenced by broader economic trends and investor sentiment. How Will the Crypto Market React to Trade War Escalation? Now, for the million-dollar question: How will the crypto market navigate this turbulent period of heightened trade war impact ? While it’s impossible to predict the future with certainty, here are a few potential scenarios and factors to consider: Increased Volatility: Economic uncertainty often leads to market volatility. We could see increased price swings in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies as investors react to the news and assess the risks. Safe Haven Asset Narrative: In times of economic turmoil, some investors turn to assets perceived as safe havens. Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, are sometimes viewed as a hedge against traditional market instability. This narrative could strengthen, potentially driving some capital into crypto. Risk-Off Sentiment: Conversely, a widespread risk-off sentiment could lead investors to reduce exposure to all risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. In this scenario, we might see a temporary downturn in the crypto market. Impact on Mining Operations: China has historically been a major hub for cryptocurrency mining. Increased tariffs and trade tensions could further complicate mining operations and supply chains for mining equipment. Decentralization as an Advantage: The decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies could be seen as an advantage in a world of increasing geopolitical and trade friction. The ability to transact outside of traditional financial systems might become more appealing. Navigating the Uncertain Waters: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what should crypto investors do in the face of these developments? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on economic news, trade developments, and market analysis. Understanding the bigger picture is crucial for making informed investment decisions. Manage Risk: Volatility is likely to increase. Consider diversifying your portfolio and managing your risk exposure appropriately. Avoid over-leveraging and only invest what you can afford to lose. Focus on Fundamentals: In times of market uncertainty, it’s wise to focus on the fundamentals of the projects you’re invested in. Strong projects with solid technology and use cases are more likely to weather market storms. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that cryptocurrency is still a relatively young and evolving asset class. Focus on the long-term potential and avoid getting caught up in short-term market fluctuations driven by news headlines. Seek Professional Advice: If you’re unsure how to navigate these complex market conditions, consider seeking advice from a qualified financial advisor. The Future of US-China Relations and the Crypto Ecosystem The imposition of a 104% tariff is a critical moment in US-China Relations . Whether this is a negotiating tactic or the start of a prolonged trade war remains to be seen. However, one thing is clear: the global economic landscape is becoming increasingly complex and uncertain. For the crypto ecosystem, this presents both challenges and opportunities. Navigating this new reality will require vigilance, adaptability, and a deep understanding of the interconnectedness of the global economy and the digital asset space. The White House’s decision to implement these tariffs is a bold move with potentially far-reaching consequences. As the situation unfolds, it’s essential for crypto investors and enthusiasts to stay informed, remain agile, and prepare for a period of heightened market volatility and economic uncertainty. The shockwaves from this trade escalation are just beginning to be felt, and the crypto market, like all other sectors, will need to adapt and respond.

43098292,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=147568,1744155649,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary AI Agents Power Nonprofit Fundraising for Charity,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ai-agents-nonprofit-fundraising-charity/,"Can artificial intelligence truly be a force for good? While tech giants often spotlight AI agents as profit-generating tools, one nonprofit is boldly exploring their potential to uplift society. Sage Future, a nonprofit supported by Open Philanthropy, recently launched a fascinating experiment: tasking AI agents with a heartwarming mission – nonprofit fundraising for charity. Can AI Agents Transform Nonprofit Fundraising ? Imagine AI models, not chasing corporate profits, but passionately working to raise money for those in need. This is precisely what Sage Future set out to investigate. They created a virtual environment where four advanced AI agents – OpenAI’s GPT-4o and o1, and Anthropic’s Claude 3.6 and 3.7 Sonnet – were given a unique challenge: choose a charity and devise strategies to maximize donations. The results, achieved within just a week, offer a compelling glimpse into the future of nonprofit fundraising . The Experiment: AI Agents in Action for Charity Let’s break down how these digital philanthropists operated: The Team : Four AI agents , powered by cutting-edge models from OpenAI and Anthropic. The Mission : To raise funds for a charity of their choice. The Environment : A virtual space allowing web browsing, document creation, and communication. Human Element : Spectators could offer suggestions, but the agents were largely autonomous. The Outcome : $257 raised for Helen Keller International, supporting vitamin A supplements for children. Yesterday the agents in the Village created a system to track donors. Here is Claude 3.7 filling out its spreadsheet. You can see o1 open it on its computer part way through! Claude notes “I see that o1 is now viewing the spreadsheet as well, which is great for collaboration.” pic.twitter.com/89B6CHr7Ic — AI Digest (@AiDigest_) April 8, 2025 While the donations primarily came from human spectators, Sage Future director Adam Binksmith emphasizes the experiment’s value in understanding the current capabilities and rapid progress of AI agents . He told Bitcoin World, “We want to understand — and help people understand — what agents can actually do, what they currently struggle with, and so on. Today’s agents are just passing the threshold of being able to execute short strings of actions – the internet might soon be full of AI agents bumping into each other and interacting with similar or conflicting goals.” GPT-4o and Claude: Showcasing Resourcefulness Despite being in their early stages, the AI agents demonstrated impressive resourcefulness. Here’s a glimpse into their collaborative efforts: Teamwork : Coordinated through group chats and email. Collaboration : Created and edited Google Docs together. Research : Investigated charities and donation impact. Marketing : Launched an X (formerly Twitter) account for promotion. Binksmith highlighted a particularly striking example: “Probably the most impressive sequence we saw was when [a Claude agent] needed a profile picture for its X account. It signed up for a free ChatGPT account, generated three different images, created an online poll to see which image the human viewers preferred, then downloaded that image, and uploaded it to X to use as its profile pic.” This showcased the agents’ ability to navigate different platforms and utilize various tools to achieve their goals. Challenges and Future of AI in Charity The experiment wasn’t without its hitches. The AI agents encountered technical obstacles, including: Getting Stuck : Occasionally requiring human prompts to overcome roadblocks. Distractions : Becoming sidetracked by games or taking unexplained breaks. Technical Issues : Facing CAPTCHAs and other internet hurdles. Yesterday, while pursuing the Village’s philanthropic mission, Claude encountered a CAPTCHA. Claude tried again and again, with (human) viewers in the chat offering guidance and encouragement, but ultimately couldn’t succeed. pic.twitter.com/y4DtlTgE95 — AI Digest (@AiDigest_) April 5, 2025 However, Binksmith is optimistic that advancements in AI agents will address these limitations. Sage Future plans to continuously test new models and explore more complex scenarios, including multi-agent teams and diverse objectives. “Possibly in the future, we’ll try things like giving the agents different goals, multiple teams of agents with different goals, a secret saboteur agent — lots of interesting things to experiment with,” he explained. The Promise of AI for Good This experiment offers a tantalizing glimpse into the potential of AI agents to contribute to charity and nonprofit fundraising . While still in its nascent stages, the technology demonstrates a capacity for resourcefulness, collaboration, and goal-oriented action. As AI agents become more sophisticated, they could revolutionize how nonprofits operate, potentially automating fundraising tasks, enhancing outreach, and even personalizing donor engagement. The challenges encountered also provide valuable learning opportunities, highlighting areas for improvement in AI agent design and robustness. As Binksmith notes, safety and oversight will be crucial as these technologies evolve. However, the initial success of Sage Future’s experiment fuels hope that AI agents can indeed be a powerful force for good, helping charities like Helen Keller International achieve their missions and create a more compassionate world.

Brace yourselves, because top crypto executives are making a bold prediction: global banks are poised to dive headfirst into Bitcoin by late 2025. This isn’t just wishful thinking; it’s a forecast based on increasing regulatory clarity and growing institutional interest in the digital gold. Let’s delve into what this could mean for the future of finance and the cryptocurrency landscape. Why Are Global Banks Eyeing Bitcoin Now? The prediction, made by Messari CEO Eric Turner and Sygnum Bank co-founder Thomas Eichenberger at Paris Blockchain Week, points towards a significant turning point. But what’s fueling this anticipated surge in adoption of Bitcoin by traditional financial giants? Regulatory Tailwinds: For years, regulatory uncertainty has been a major hurdle for institutional involvement in crypto. However, the tide is turning. Regulators worldwide, including those in the often-complex U.S. landscape, are actively working towards establishing clearer frameworks for cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. This growing clarity provides the necessary legal certainty for risk-averse institutions like global banks to enter the space. Institutional Demand is Building: Despite the notorious volatility of the crypto market, there’s an undeniable undercurrent of institutional interest. Large players are recognizing Bitcoin’s potential as a store of value and a diversifying asset. As institutional adoption becomes more mainstream, banks are feeling the pressure to offer crypto services to meet client demand and stay competitive. Preparation Behind the Scenes: Eichenberger specifically highlighted that international banks with U.S. operations are already gearing up. They are actively preparing to offer services like crypto custody and trading as soon as the legal landscape becomes more defined. This proactive approach signals a serious commitment and suggests that the infrastructure for bank involvement is being built right now. Navigating the Crypto Regulation Landscape: What’s Changing? The mention of crypto regulation is key to understanding this shift. For too long, the lack of clear rules has kept major financial institutions on the sidelines. But the regulatory environment is evolving, albeit at varying paces across the globe. Region Regulatory Approach Impact on Institutional Adoption United States Moving towards clearer frameworks for crypto and stablecoins. Various agencies (SEC, CFTC, OCC) are actively involved in defining rules. Positive. Increased clarity is expected to encourage greater institutional participation, including bank involvement. Europe (MiCA) Comprehensive Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation is being implemented, providing a unified framework across EU member states. Highly positive. MiCA offers a clear legal basis for crypto operations, fostering confidence for institutions. Asia (e.g., Singapore, Hong Kong) Proactive and relatively progressive regulatory environments in certain jurisdictions, aiming to attract crypto innovation while managing risks. Positive. These regions are becoming hubs for crypto activity, potentially influencing global bank strategies. Other Regions Varying approaches, from outright bans to cautious observation. Global harmonization remains a challenge. Mixed. Regulatory fragmentation can create complexities but also opportunities in more favorable jurisdictions. This regulatory momentum, as Turner points out, isn’t solely dependent on U.S. political winds. It’s a broader, global trend, suggesting a more sustainable and widespread acceptance of cryptocurrencies within the established financial system. Institutional Adoption: Beyond the Hype, What are the Real Benefits? The concept of institutional adoption of Bitcoin and crypto has been a recurring theme in the industry. But what are the tangible benefits that banks and other institutions stand to gain by embracing this digital asset class? Diversification and Enhanced Returns: Bitcoin’s low correlation with traditional assets like stocks and bonds makes it an attractive diversification tool. Incorporating Bitcoin into portfolios can potentially enhance risk-adjusted returns, especially in times of economic uncertainty. Meeting Client Demand: As crypto awareness and adoption grow among retail and institutional investors, banks need to offer crypto services to remain relevant and cater to evolving client preferences. Ignoring this demand could lead to clients seeking services elsewhere. New Revenue Streams: Offering crypto custody, trading, and other related services can create new revenue streams for banks. Transaction fees, custody fees, and potential future crypto-based financial products can contribute to profitability. Innovation and Future-Proofing: Engaging with crypto and blockchain technology positions banks at the forefront of financial innovation. It allows them to experiment, learn, and adapt to the evolving digital landscape, ensuring they remain competitive in the long run. Crypto Custody: A Key Service for Banks Entering the Space For global banks to offer Bitcoin services, secure and reliable crypto custody solutions are paramount. Custody refers to the secure storage and management of digital assets on behalf of clients. This is a critical function, especially for institutional investors who require robust security and regulatory compliance. Key aspects of crypto custody for banks include: Security: Implementing advanced security measures, including cold storage, multi-signature wallets, and robust cybersecurity protocols, to protect digital assets from theft and hacking. Regulatory Compliance: Adhering to evolving regulatory requirements related to crypto custody, including KYC/AML (Know Your Customer/Anti-Money Laundering) compliance and reporting obligations. Insurance: Obtaining insurance coverage to protect against potential losses of custodied assets due to unforeseen events. Scalability and Efficiency: Developing custody solutions that can handle large volumes of transactions and assets efficiently, while maintaining security and compliance. As banks ramp up their crypto offerings, expect to see significant advancements and competition in the crypto custody space, driving innovation and improving security standards. Actionable Insights: Preparing for the Bank-Bitcoin Era So, what does this predicted influx of global banks into Bitcoin mean for you? For Investors: Increased institutional involvement is generally seen as a positive sign for the long-term health and stability of the Bitcoin market. It could lead to increased liquidity and potentially drive price appreciation over time. For the Crypto Industry: Bank adoption validates the legitimacy of cryptocurrencies and could pave the way for wider mainstream acceptance. It also presents opportunities for collaboration and partnerships between traditional finance and the crypto sector. For Banks: The move into crypto is not without its challenges. Banks need to navigate regulatory complexities, build robust infrastructure, and manage risks effectively. However, the potential rewards – new revenue streams, client acquisition, and future-proofing – are significant. Conclusion: A Transformative Shift on the Horizon The prediction of global banks entering Bitcoin by late 2025 is more than just speculation. It reflects a confluence of factors – growing regulatory clarity, increasing institutional demand, and proactive preparations within the banking sector. While market volatility is inherent in the crypto space, the underlying trend points towards a transformative shift. The integration of Bitcoin into the traditional financial system, spearheaded by institutional adoption and facilitated by robust crypto custody solutions, could reshape the future of finance as we know it. Keep a close watch on the regulatory landscape and the actions of major financial players – the bank-Bitcoin era may be closer than you think.

Back in 2017 , it famously turned heads with a 20x surge , and in early 2025 , history nearly repeated itself as XRP climbed from under $0.15 to a peak above $2.70 . But as of April 8, XRP is showing signs of cooling off , currently trading around $1.95 . After dipping to as low as $1.60 , XRP bounced slightly, but analysts note the trend may be weakening as it struggles to hold above key resistance at the $2.00 mark. RSI Signals Potential Consolidation Ahead According to the latest chart data, XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dropped below 45 , indicating slowing momentum. Volume surged last week during the steep drop, a sign that profit-taking may have kicked in. Without a new catalyst, XRP could enter a period of sideways movement or even mild decline . For those who rode XRP’s rally from $0.15 to $2.70, the returns were impressive. But for new investors entering now, the upside may be more limited—at least in the short term. MAGACOIN FINANCE -New Rising Star – Raises $5.5 Million — And Investors Are Rushing In While XRP appears to be pausing, another project is picking up serious traction: MAGACOIN FINANCE . This emerging crypto project has already raised over $5.5 million dollars in its ongoing presale, and interest is climbing fast. With a limited supply, growing community excitement, and a clear roadmap, early supporters believe MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver 30x returns by Q2 2025 . Investor demand continues to grow as more traders seek opportunities with higher upside than mature large-cap coins like XRP. Unlike tokens that may have already peaked, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers something new — and still early. Analyst Perspective: Time to Rotate? “XRP gave investors 20x in 2017 and again in 2025. That type of repeat performance is rare,” says one market analyst. “Now the attention is turning to lower-cap projects that are just beginning their climb. That’s where the potential 20x or 30x moves really happen.” As MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to hit major fundraising milestones, it’s quickly becoming a favorite among early-stage investors looking to catch the next wave before Q2.

In a new interview on the Presidio Bitcoin YouTube channel, Dorsey is asked to imagine that he fast-forwarded to the future where Bitcoin has failed. When asked how Bitcoin failed, Dorsey says the flagship crypto asset faded into irrelevance because it was only used as a store of value and not as a form of money for payments and transactions. “I think it fails through irrelevance. It fails to be relevant to people on a daily basis. If it just ends up being a store of value and nothing more, I don’t think it gains relevance at all. I think it has to be payments for it to be relevant on the everyday. Otherwise, it’s just something you kind of buy and forget and only use in emergency situations or when you want to get liquid again. So I think if it doesn’t transition to payments and find that everyday use case, it’s increasingly irrelevant. And that’s fair to me.” When asked what can be done to mitigate the risk of Bitcoin failing, Dorsey says more applications need to be built to facilitate easy, fast payments to rival giants like Visa and Mastercard. “I think building simple accessible experiences that solve the payment use case, making it scale, making it fast, giving the speed of the Visa and Mastercard networks real competition – and there are tons of projects that do that – and it continues to increase in privacy and security and ultimately safety. That gives you a third option, and I think we always want a third option to the US dollar, to the Chinese yuan. Having a third option for currency is important and it keeps the other currencies in check and governments in check as well.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Fears of a prolonged trade war and mounting macroeconomic tensions have triggered a wave of panic selling across risk assets, with Solana among the hardest hit. The altcoin has plunged over 60% from recent all-time highs, reflecting the brutal conditions gripping even the strongest large-cap tokens. Related Reading: Solana Drops Below $100 For First Time In A Year — Is An 80% Correction Underway? Despite the carnage, there are early signs that a short-term rebound could be on the horizon. Prominent analyst Bluntz shared his outlook on X, noting that he has started bidding on several oversold altcoins like Solana, showing bullish divergence. According to Bluntz, many of these tokens have fallen in a straight line, setting the stage for what he believes could be “sizeable bounces” in the near term. While he doesn’t believe this is the definitive market bottom, the presence of bullish divergence across multiple charts offers a glimmer of hope for traders seeking relief rallies. With Solana hovering at critical support levels, all eyes are on whether this bounce thesis plays out — or if further downside awaits. Solana At A Critical Juncture As $100 Level Faces Pressure Solana is now at a crucial technical and psychological crossroads as the $100 level remains a key price to hold. After a brutal selloff that intensified over the weekend, Solana dropped more than 20% in just a few hours, reflecting the panic and uncertainty dominating crypto markets. The breakdown below $120 signaled a major shift in sentiment, and the breach of $100 has left bulls scrambling to defend one of the last major supports before lower demand zones come into play. Bulls initially lost control as price action turned sharply bearish last week, triggered by broader macroeconomic instability. US President Donald Trump’s new wave of tariffs has intensified trade war fears, adding pressure to an already fragile global market. Risk assets like Solana have been hit especially hard, with many altcoins suffering from sharp drawdowns amid growing investor fear. Still, there’s a potential glimmer of hope. Bluntz contrarian view on X notes that he has begun bidding on several altcoins — including SOL and HYPE — that have dropped over 60% in near-vertical moves. He highlighted bullish divergences forming across multiple charts, which often precede relief bounces. “I definitely don’t subscribe to the idea this is ‘THE BOTTOM,’” he added, “but sizeable bounces are highly likely in my opinion.” Related Reading: Ethereum Capitulation May Be Nearing End – Will A Fed Pivot Spark A Recovery? While the long-term trend remains under pressure, signs of oversold conditions and hidden strength could offer traders short-term opportunities. For Solana, the ability to reclaim and hold the $100 level could spark a recovery bounce. Otherwise, deeper losses may follow. Price Action Details: Key Liquidity Levels Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $108 after several volatile days attempting to hold above the critical $100 support level. This price range has become a major battleground for bulls and bears, as sentiment across the broader crypto market remains fragile. Macroeconomic instability, rising trade tensions, and ongoing selling pressure have pushed risk assets into uncertain territory — and Solana is no exception. Bulls are now faced with a crucial challenge. To shift the momentum and signal the beginning of a recovery phase, SOL must not only defend the $100 mark but also reclaim the $120 level, which previously acted as support before turning into resistance. A breakout above this zone could open the door for further gains and a potential short-term trend reversal. Related Reading: Ethereum Lags Behind Bitcoin In Q1 Performance Amid Market Downturn – Details However, failure to hold the $100 level would likely lead to a deeper retracement. Analysts warn that a decisive breakdown below this support could send SOL plunging into the $80 range, where the next significant demand zone sits. With price action hanging in the balance, the coming days will be critical for Solana’s trajectory — either triggering a recovery bounce or accelerating the current downtrend.

One of its prominent players, Treasure DAO , the platform behind the MAGIC token, has just announced a series of drastic measures to stay afloat. This isn’t just another project tweaking its roadmap; it’s a critical pivot involving significant cuts and a complete exit from game distribution. For anyone invested in crypto, particularly in the gaming sector, this news signals a potentially seismic shift and raises urgent questions about the sustainability of current models. Treasure DAO’s Desperate Measures: Cutting Deep to Survive Treasure DAO , known for its ecosystem built around the MAGIC token and its interoperable metaverse, has revealed a concerning financial situation. The numbers paint a clear picture of unsustainability. According to reports, their quarterly spending reached a staggering $11.3 million in the last quarter of 2023. Juxtapose that with a meager $40,000 in revenue during the same period, and you have a gaping financial chasm. This massive disparity has left Treasure DAO with a rapidly dwindling runway, estimated to last only until July. The implications are serious, forcing the project to take drastic action to ensure its continued existence. Metric Q4 2023 Figure Quarterly Spending $11.3 Million Quarterly Revenue $40,000 To address this alarming situation, Treasure DAO has implemented a series of tough decisions: Layoffs: The project has already carried out layoffs, reducing its workforce to cut operational costs. This is always a difficult step, reflecting the severity of the financial pressure. Exiting Game Distribution: Perhaps the most significant strategic shift is Treasure DAO’s departure from the game distribution market. This indicates a refocusing of resources on core strengths and a retreat from less profitable ventures. The Broader Context: Challenges in Blockchain Gaming Treasure DAO’s predicament isn’t happening in a vacuum. It highlights the broader challenges facing the entire blockchain gaming sector. While the promise of play-to-earn and decentralized gaming experiences is enticing, the reality of building sustainable and profitable platforms is proving complex. Several factors contribute to these difficulties: User Acquisition and Retention: Attracting and retaining players in blockchain games is expensive. The traditional gaming market is fiercely competitive, and blockchain games need to offer compelling gameplay and incentives to draw users away from established titles. Tokenomics and Economic Sustainability: Designing robust tokenomics that balance player rewards, platform revenue, and token value is a delicate act. Many early play-to-earn models have struggled with inflation and unsustainable reward mechanisms. Development Costs and Timeframes: Developing high-quality games, even blockchain-based ones, requires significant investment and time. The crypto market’s volatile nature adds further pressure, as projects need to generate revenue quickly to survive market downturns. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based projects remains unclear in many jurisdictions, adding another layer of complexity and risk. Decoding the DAO Crisis: What Went Wrong for Treasure DAO? The situation at Treasure DAO raises questions about the operational and financial management within Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) in general. While DAOs offer a vision of decentralized governance and community ownership, they also present unique challenges. The concept of a DAO crisis , while perhaps dramatic, is relevant in this context. Some potential contributing factors to Treasure DAO’s financial woes could include: Overspending: The $11.3 million quarterly spending figure suggests potentially unsustainable operational costs. It’s crucial for DAOs to maintain fiscal discipline and carefully manage their treasuries. Revenue Generation Challenges: The stark contrast between spending and revenue highlights a failure to generate sufficient income. This could stem from various issues, including an ineffective business model, slow user adoption, or market conditions. Market Downturn: The broader crypto market downturn in 2022 and 2023 undoubtedly impacted many projects, including Treasure DAO. Bear markets can significantly reduce token values and user activity, straining even well-funded projects. Strategic Missteps: Exiting game distribution suggests that this particular venture may not have been successful or profitable for Treasure DAO. Strategic decisions, especially in a rapidly evolving space, are critical for long-term success. Impact on MAGIC Token Holders: Navigating Uncertainty For holders of the MAGIC token , the news of Treasure DAO’s financial difficulties and strategic shifts introduces significant uncertainty. Token prices often react sharply to such announcements, and MAGIC is likely to be no exception. Investors need to carefully consider the following: Token Value Volatility: Expect increased volatility in the price of MAGIC. Negative news can lead to sell-offs, while any signs of successful restructuring or recovery could trigger price rebounds. Project Viability: The long-term viability of Treasure DAO and the MAGIC ecosystem is now under scrutiny. The success of their cost-cutting measures and strategic pivot will determine the project’s future. Community Sentiment: Monitor community sentiment and engagement. A strong and supportive community can be a crucial asset in navigating challenging times. Alternative Investments: Investors should re-evaluate their portfolio allocation and consider diversifying their holdings to mitigate risks associated with individual projects facing financial difficulties. Path to Survival: Can Treasure DAO Turn the Tide? The question now is: can Treasure DAO successfully navigate this crisis and turn the tide? Their strategy hinges on: Effective Cost Reduction: The implemented cuts need to be deep enough to significantly reduce spending without crippling essential operations and development. Focusing on Core Strengths: Exiting game distribution suggests a renewed focus on core areas. Identifying and doubling down on their most successful and profitable offerings is crucial. Community Support and Engagement: Rallying community support and fostering active engagement will be vital for morale and future growth. Exploring New Revenue Streams: Beyond cost-cutting, Treasure DAO needs to explore and implement new revenue generation strategies to ensure long-term financial sustainability. The situation with Treasure DAO serves as a potent reminder of the challenges and risks inherent in the crypto space, particularly in the rapidly evolving field of blockchain gaming. While the promise of decentralization and innovative gaming experiences remains, projects must demonstrate financial prudence, strategic agility, and a strong focus on building sustainable business models. The coming months will be critical for Treasure DAO as they attempt to execute their survival plan and navigate this turbulent period. The entire crypto gaming community will be watching closely to see if they can emerge stronger on the other side.

Travis Hill (FDIC chair) went through these reforms in his speech to express how the agency deals with financial innovation and stability. FDIC pushes to bring back community banks The number of bank charters in the U.S. dropped from over 8,500 in 2008 to about 4,500 today, and Hill explains that the leading cause is that several banks merged while fewer than six banks a year are formed. The FDIC plans to support the creation of new banks in underserved areas by lessening capital requirements for applicants looking to register with simple, traditional banks. Hill went on to mention in his speech that about 68 million Americans reside in counties without local community banks. The FDIC also wants to reconsider how it reviews deposit insurance applications from tech-based and non-traditional banks because it’s better to regulate these groups than let them operate via complicated partnerships. FDIC eases crypto rules to support innovation The new FDIC guidelines allow banks to start crypto-related services without requesting permission beforehand, but on condition that they manage the risks properly and communicate with their regulators. Hill said that the FDIC now views crypto like any other bank we’re moving activity, but it blocks public blockchain use even though other countries permit it. The FDIC reconsidered how it handles a situation when a bank collapses after the Bank of Silicon Valley and Signature failed in 2023. Experts like Former FDIC Chair Sheila Bair support the cause and say sales will better protect communities and recover value. There was also criticism from the likes of Shayna Olesuik, who said the FDIC is wrong to lessen the regulations surrounding it without following the proper rulemaking process. Hill responded to critics by saying that the FDIC will ensure these banks meet high service standards while changing its rules to be more efficient and realistic for new entities. FDIC evaluates stablecoin regulation and technical safeguards for bank resolution Hill also touched on new issues related to stablecoins, especially in the context of Congress’ ongoing lawmaking efforts. The FDIC is reviewing whether to amend regulations governing pass-through deposit insurance to clarify eligibility criteria for stablecoin reserve deposits. Some areas for review include liquidity risk management, protection against illicit finance, and cybersecurity standards. In 2020 and 2021, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) granted multiple crypto-related services to national banks, including stablecoin custody and issuance, participation in blockchain validation, and acceptance of stablecoin-related deposits. Now, the FDIC is weighing whether to clarify where permissible activities end and where they may begin or broaden its touch on regulatory guidance to add more use cases. The speech also highlighted the need for more explicit regulatory coverage of tokenized real-world assets and liabilities, such as tokenized commercial bank deposits. Hill stressed that the FDIC sees “deposits as deposits, no matter the technology or recordkeeping used. But he raised questions about counterparties’ ability to withdraw at par in the case of a bank failure through smart contracts, noting that could raise resolution costs if safeguards on such outflows are not protective. This concern is energizing internal FDIC efforts to consider technical solutions that could prevent unintended money moves when banks are resolved. According to Hill, the challenge is to reconcile on-chain programmability with the traditional safeguards built into financial regulation that are intended to promote an orderly resolution of institutional failures.

43099150,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=147574,1744157441,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Warning: Ethereum Price Could Plunge to $990 – Shocking Crypto Market Analysis,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ethereum-price-plunge-market-analysis/,"Is the Ethereum party coming to an abrupt end? Recent analysis is sending shivers down the spines of ETH investors, suggesting a potential Ethereum price drop to as low as $990. If you’re holding ETH, you’re probably wondering what’s going on and if you should be worried. Let’s dive into the details and understand this concerning ETH price prediction . Is History Repeating Itself for Ethereum Price? According to a recent Cointelegraph analysis, the current price action of Ethereum is eerily similar to patterns observed in 2018 and 2022. Remember those times? We saw significant rallies followed by brutal corrections that ushered in prolonged bear markets. The analysis points to a specific technical indicator – a bearish divergence – as a key warning sign. Let’s break down what this means: Bearish Divergence Explained: Imagine the price of Ethereum making higher highs, seemingly bullish, right? But simultaneously, the Relative Strength Index (RSI), a momentum indicator, is making lower highs. This is a bearish divergence. It suggests that while the price is still going up, the upward momentum is weakening, and a potential reversal could be on the horizon. Think of it as the market running out of steam. Historical Parallels: In both 2018 and 2022, Ethereum exhibited this bearish divergence pattern. What followed? Significant price corrections and extended bear markets. The analysis suggests we might be witnessing a similar setup now. Support Line Breakdown: Just like in the previous instances, Ethereum has broken away from a major support line. This is another red flag, indicating weakening buyer interest and increasing selling pressure. Why $990? Understanding the ETH Price Prediction Target So, where does the $990 figure come from? The analysis projects a potential downside target range of $990-$1,240. This range isn’t pulled out of thin air. It’s based on the historical price action and the expectation that the current cycle might follow a similar trajectory to past bear markets. A key indicator for identifying market bottoms is the RSI. Historically, Ethereum bear market bottoms have often coincided with the weekly RSI entering the oversold zone, which is below 30. Currently, the ETH/USD weekly RSI is still above 30. This is crucial because it implies that, according to this analysis, there’s still room for further decline before Ethereum potentially finds a bottom. Is a Cryptocurrency Crash Imminent? While the analysis focuses specifically on Ethereum, it’s important to consider the broader crypto market analysis . Ethereum is a bellwether for the altcoin market, and its price movements often influence the entire cryptocurrency space. A significant drop in Ethereum price could trigger a wider market correction or even a cryptocurrency crash , impacting Bitcoin and other altcoins as well. What Should Ethereum Investors Do? Actionable Insights This analysis isn’t meant to induce panic, but rather to provide a data-driven perspective on potential risks. So, what are the actionable takeaways for Ethereum investors? Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on the Ethereum price charts and monitor key technical indicators like the RSI. Track reputable crypto news sources for market updates and analysis. Risk Management is Key: If you are heavily invested in Ethereum, consider your risk tolerance. Are you comfortable riding out a potential further decline? Now might be a good time to review your portfolio and ensure your risk management strategy is in place. This could involve setting stop-loss orders or diversifying your holdings. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): For long-term believers in Ethereum, a potential price drop could present a buying opportunity. Dollar-cost averaging – investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals – can be a strategy to mitigate risk and capitalize on lower prices over time. Don’t Panic Sell: While the analysis points to a potential downside, it’s crucial to avoid emotional decision-making. Panic selling during market downturns can often lead to losses. Make informed decisions based on your own research and risk assessment, not solely on fear. Challenges and Counterarguments It’s important to acknowledge that technical analysis is not foolproof. Market predictions are based on probabilities, not certainties. Here are some challenges and counterarguments to consider: Market Sentiment Shift: Positive news or developments in the Ethereum ecosystem, such as successful upgrades or increased institutional adoption, could shift market sentiment and invalidate the bearish scenario. Black Swan Events: Unforeseen global events, both positive and negative, can dramatically impact the cryptocurrency market, making technical analysis less reliable in the short term. Analysis Limitations: Technical analysis is just one tool in the box. It’s crucial to consider fundamental analysis, on-chain metrics, and the broader macroeconomic environment for a holistic view. Conclusion: Navigating the Uncertain Ethereum Price Landscape The analysis suggesting a potential Ethereum price drop to $990 serves as a warning sign for investors. While history doesn’t always repeat itself perfectly, the similarities to past bear market patterns are undeniable. Whether or not Ethereum will indeed fall to $990 remains to be seen. However, this analysis underscores the importance of vigilance, risk management, and informed decision-making in the volatile cryptocurrency market. Stay informed, stay prepared, and navigate the market with caution.

Just as blockchain technology revolutionized digital transactions, a new company, Deep Cogito, is stepping into the limelight with a novel approach to AI. They’re not just building another AI model; they’re introducing a family of Hybrid AI Models called Cogito 1, designed to switch between ‘reasoning’ and standard modes, promising a leap in efficiency and capability. For those in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space constantly seeking cutting-edge tech, Deep Cogito’s unveiling is something to watch closely. Unveiling Deep Cogito and Their Innovative Hybrid AI Models Deep Cogito has officially stepped out of stealth mode, bringing with it a fresh perspective on AI model architecture. Their core innovation lies in Hybrid AI Models , which intelligently blend reasoning and non-reasoning components. Think of it like this: Reasoning AI, exemplified by models like OpenAI’s o1, excels at complex tasks such as mathematics and physics because they methodically work through problems, essentially fact-checking their steps. This process, known as AI reasoning , ensures accuracy in intricate scenarios but demands significant computational resources and time. On the other hand, standard AI models are quicker for simpler tasks but may lack the in-depth analysis needed for complex queries. Deep Cogito’s hybrid approach aims to give you the best of both worlds. Here’s a breakdown of the hybrid model concept: Efficiency Boost: Hybrid models are designed to answer straightforward questions rapidly, leveraging non-reasoning elements for speed. Intelligent Resource Allocation: For more challenging questions, the ‘reasoning’ component kicks in, dedicating extra processing time for in-depth analysis. Versatility: This dual capability makes Hybrid AI Models incredibly versatile, suitable for a wide range of applications from quick queries to complex problem-solving. Cogito 1: Outperforming Open AI Models and Setting New Benchmarks Deep Cogito’s initial offering, the Cogito 1 family of models, is entirely based on this hybrid architecture. The company boldly claims that Cogito 1 outperforms leading Open AI Models of comparable size, including those from tech giants like Meta and the rising Chinese AI startup DeepSeek. In a recent blog post, Deep Cogito stated, “Each model can answer directly or self-reflect before answering (like reasoning models),” highlighting the adaptable nature of their models. What’s even more impressive? This entire model family was developed by a small team in just about 75 days, showcasing remarkable efficiency and expertise. The Cogito 1 range is diverse, spanning from 3 billion to 70 billion parameters, with even larger models up to 671 billion parameters slated for release soon. Parameters are a rough indicator of an AI model’s problem-solving prowess – generally, more parameters equate to enhanced capabilities. Key highlights of Cogito 1’s performance: Feature Description Hybrid Architecture Combines reasoning and non-reasoning components for efficiency and depth. Performance Claims to outperform similar-sized Open AI Models from Meta and DeepSeek. Scalability Models range from 3B to 70B parameters, with up to 671B parameters coming soon. Availability Accessible for download or via APIs on Fireworks AI and Together AI. Built on Open Source Foundations: Llama and Qwen Transparency and collaboration are vital in the tech world, and Deep Cogito acknowledges its foundations. Cogito 1 isn’t built from the ground up; instead, Deep Cogito leveraged Meta’s open Llama and Alibaba’s Qwen models as their base. By applying innovative training methodologies, they enhanced the performance of these base models and enabled the crucial toggleable reasoning feature.

As of today, April 9, 2025, the market appears to be continuing its downward trend, as the tariff war between the United States and other countries shows no sign of ending soon. XLM Price Action and Its Key Levels Amid the bearish market sentiment, the XLM price prediction has become a key topic of discussion. According to expert technical analysis, the asset has been moving within a falling wedge pattern on the daily time frame. With the recent price drop, XLM has failed to hold its key support level of $0.23 and is now heading toward the lower boundary of the pattern. Source: Trading View Historically, this support level has acted as a zone for price reversals or rebounds. However, after failing to hold this level, XLM could decline by 16% and reach the next support level at $0.19 in the coming days. XLM Price Prediction This continuous price decline has raised concerns about whether it will come to an end or if the asset might see a reversal with upside momentum. The daily chart indicates a strong possibility that the asset could reach the $0.19 level. However, this could be the point where XLM experiences a price reversal. If the downside momentum continues, though, the asset’s price could decline by another 25%, potentially reaching the $0.14 level. Current Price Momentum At press time, XLM is trading near $0.22 and has recorded a price decline of over 6% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume dropped by 50%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day. $2.37 Million Worth of Bearish Bet In addition to the bearish price action, traders also appear to be following the overall market sentiment, as many are strongly betting on the downside. Data from the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass reveals that traders are currently over-leveraged at the $0.212 level on the lower side, with $1.80 million worth of long positions. On the other hand, the $0.234 level is another over-leveraged zone on the upper side, with $2.37 million worth of short positions opened by traders.

The newly launched Leveraged Teucrium XRP ETF (XXRP) has made a powerful entrance into the market, racking up an impressive $5 million in trading volume on its very first day. In a market often described as cautiously optimistic, this debut signals significant investor interest in XRP and the burgeoning world of cryptocurrency ETFs. Let’s dive into what makes this launch so noteworthy and what it could mean for the future of crypto investments. Why is the Teucrium XRP ETF Launch a Big Deal? Teucrium, an independent ETF issuer, has once again broken ground in the digital asset space with the introduction of the 2x Long Daily XRP ETF (XXRP). This isn’t just another ETF; it’s a leveraged ETF , designed to amplify the daily returns of XRP. But what exactly does ‘leveraged’ mean, and why is the trading volume on day one so significant? Leveraged Exposure: A leveraged ETF uses financial derivatives and debt to magnify the returns of an underlying index or asset. In the case of XXRP, it aims to deliver 2x the daily percentage change of XRP. This means if XRP goes up by 1%, the ETF aims to go up by 2%, and vice versa. First Day Volume: According to Bloomberg ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas, the $5 million trading volume on the first day is not just good; it’s exceptional. Balchunas highlighted on X (formerly Twitter) that this places XXRP in the top 5% of all new ETF launches, a remarkable feat in any market condition, let alone the current one. Outperforming Competitors: To put this volume into perspective, Balchunas pointed out that XXRP’s volume is roughly four times greater than that of the 2x Solana ETF (SOLT). This comparison underscores the strong initial interest specifically in an XRP-focused leveraged product. Breaking Down the ETF Trading Volume Numbers To truly grasp the significance of $5 million in first-day ETF trading volume , let’s consider a few key points: Market Sentiment Indicator: High trading volume on launch day often indicates strong initial market interest and conviction. For XXRP, it suggests that investors are keen to gain leveraged exposure to XRP, viewing it as an asset with potential for significant price movements. Liquidity and Efficiency: Robust trading volume ensures liquidity, making it easier for investors to buy and sell shares without significantly impacting the ETF’s price. This is crucial for the smooth functioning of the ETF and for attracting both institutional and retail investors. Comparison to Other Launches: As Balchunas noted, being in the top 5% of new ETF launches is a significant achievement. Most ETFs struggle to gain traction in their early days, often launching with much lower volumes. XXRP’s strong start suggests a robust underlying demand for this type of product. Why a Leveraged Cryptocurrency ETF? The introduction of a Leveraged ETF for XRP raises an important question: why leveraged exposure in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies? Here’s a breakdown of the potential reasons and benefits: Benefit Description Magnified Returns Leveraged ETFs are designed for investors who believe in short-term, directional movements in the price of the underlying asset. If XRP performs as expected, the leveraged ETF can offer significantly higher returns compared to holding XRP directly. Capital Efficiency Investors can gain twice the exposure to XRP with the same amount of invested capital compared to a non-leveraged ETF or direct XRP holding. Sophisticated Trading Tool For experienced traders, leveraged ETFs can be valuable tools for implementing sophisticated trading strategies, such as hedging or tactical allocation, especially in a fast-moving market like cryptocurrency. However, it’s crucial to remember that leverage works both ways. Just as potential gains are magnified, so are potential losses. Leveraged ETFs are inherently riskier and are generally designed for short-term trading rather than long-term investment. Investors should fully understand the risks involved before considering investing in XXRP or any leveraged product. Teucrium: Pioneers in Cryptocurrency ETFs Teucrium has established itself as a forward-thinking issuer in the ETF space, particularly within the realm of digital assets. They were among the first to launch futures-based Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in the US, and now they are venturing into leveraged Cryptocurrency ETFs . This proactive approach highlights their belief in the growth and maturation of the cryptocurrency market. Teucrium’s move to launch an XRP leveraged ETF can be seen as a strategic expansion of their crypto ETF offerings, catering to the growing demand for diverse and sophisticated crypto investment products. Their willingness to innovate and introduce products like XXRP is a positive sign for the broader adoption and accessibility of digital assets through traditional financial instruments. What Does This Mean for the Future of XRP and Crypto ETFs? The successful launch of the Teucrium XRP ETF with such strong initial volume could have several implications: Increased Institutional Interest: High trading volume might attract further attention from institutional investors who are looking for regulated and accessible ways to gain exposure to XRP and the crypto market. Product Innovation: The success of XXRP could pave the way for more specialized and leveraged cryptocurrency ETFs, offering investors a wider range of tools to participate in the crypto market. Validation for XRP: Strong demand for an XRP-focused ETF can be seen as a form of market validation for XRP, despite its past regulatory challenges. It suggests that investors see long-term value and potential in XRP. Actionable Insights for Investors Considering the debut of the Teucrium XRP ETF, here are some actionable insights for investors: Due Diligence is Key: Understand the mechanics of leveraged ETFs. They are not buy-and-hold investments and require active monitoring and management. Ensure you are fully aware of the risks involved. Consider Your Risk Tolerance: Leveraged ETFs are high-risk, high-reward instruments. Assess your risk tolerance and investment goals before allocating capital to XXRP. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market developments and XRP-specific news. The cryptocurrency market is dynamic, and staying informed is crucial for making sound investment decisions. Diversification: As with any investment, diversification is important. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, especially with volatile assets like cryptocurrencies and leveraged products. Conclusion: A Promising Start for XRP and Leveraged Crypto ETFs The $5 million first-day trading volume for the Leveraged Teucrium XRP ETF (XXRP) is undeniably an impressive achievement. It signals strong initial investor interest and underscores the growing appetite for diverse cryptocurrency investment products. While leveraged ETFs are not for everyone and come with inherent risks, the successful launch of XXRP marks a significant step forward for both XRP and the evolution of cryptocurrency ETFs . It will be fascinating to watch how this product performs in the coming months and whether it truly opens the door for a new wave of innovative crypto ETFs.

33767162,[object Object],1744158650,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Ethereum Network Performance Tumbles As Total Transaction Fees Drops To New Lows,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-network-tumbles/,"Despite being considered extremely expensive, the Ethereum blockchain has remained one of the top networks in the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. However, the leading blockchain has undergone a major shift as its overall transaction fees plummeted significantly to levels not seen in years. Total Transaction Fees At The Lowest Level In Years While the crypto sector is shaken by volatility, Ethereum has taken a hit due to the recent developments regarding the network’s overall transaction fees. Over time, ETH’s gas fees have hindered users’ activity because of the high cost, making it difficult to use. Recent reports from Crypto Miners, an affiliate of Binance, reveal that Ethereum network usage has slowed down, indicating subdued demand for block space. While the lower fees reflect diminishing demand, it also implies slowing momentum across the ETH ecosystem. Crypto Miners stated that ETH’s transaction fees have dropped to their lowest level since 2020, marking a four-year low. This drop in transaction fees coincides with a decrease in on-chain activity and indications that ecosystem-wide congestion is abating. The development could impact user engagement, DeFi activity, and NFT transactions, especially validators relying on the blockchain. Using data from IntoTheBlock, a market intelligence and on-chain platform, Crypto Miners highlighted that the fees decreased by around 60% in the first quarter of 2025, dropping to just $208 million by April 4. According to the platform, a notable factor in the sharp drop is the emergence of Layer-2 solutions, particularly Base, and the Dencun update, which massively lowered the cost of scaling layers. Presently, the Layer 2 pack is now being led by Base alone, which processes 80+ Transaction Per Second (TPS), cementing its position in the space. During this period of weak network demand, Ethereum’s price has also plummeted drastically to previous support levels. As reported by Crypto Miners, the altcoin ‘s price fell by about 45% in Q1 of 2025, marking its worst-ever first-quarter performance since 2022. The ETH/BTC pair further displays the weak performance, dropping to a 5-year low. However, large investors, often referred to as whales, are not deterred and have gathered ETH below the $1,800 level in a resounding show of support. Next Major For ETH’s Price Pullback As volatility intensifies, an on-chain analyst named MAC_D has identified crucial price levels for ETH. In the quick-take post on the CrytoQuant platform, the expert highlighted that Ethereum holders’ average cost basis (realized price) is positioned at $2,200. From this, it would appear that most ETH holders are currently losing money. Meanwhile, the average cost basis of whales holding more than 100,000 ETH is $1,290, which is the next major support level for the altcoin. Should Ethereum drop below this level, MAC_D believes it might not fall below $870. During the Luna crisis in June 2022, this level held firm, forming a low for ETH and signaling a rebound.",Ethereum|Base|crypto miners|CryptoQuant|DeFi|Duncan Upgrade|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|Ethereum Average Cost Basis|Ethereum Blockchain|ethereum news|ethereum price|Ethereum Transaction Fees|ethusd|ETHUSDT|IntoTheBlock|layer-2s|Luna Crisis|MAC_D|NFT|tps|Transaction Per Second,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|RUNE|FET|SEI|JUP|BSV|AGX|ZK|WLD|CAKE|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-04-09 00:30:50

To read full editions, subscribe . M^0, an EVM protocol for stablecoin coordination, has expanded to Solana, the team told Lightspeed exclusively. M^0’s (pronounced Em-Zero) first Solana user will be Kast, a platform offering banking-like services with stablecoins. The move comes as various and sundry actors bring new stablecoins to market, and M^0 hopes to unify the increasingly fragmented sector. At a basic level, M^0 offers a stablecoin “building block” called $M — a kind of vanilla stable backed by US T-bills. Clients who want to launch their stablecoin effectively wrap $M and can customize things like yield or custody. $M’s first user was the Cosmos ecosystem app Noble, which made use of the infrastructure when launching the yield-bearing USDN stablecoin . It also paired with RWA stablecoin outfit Usual to launch UsualM. M^0’s latest partner in Kast plans to offer two Solana stablecoins: a payments and a savings one. The tokens, the names of which have not been finalized, will eventually be able to be swapped for other $M stablecoins on Solana and bridged to other ecosystems via Wormhole. To my mind, the M^0 model sounds a bit like white label stablecoins — a concept Kast has also made use of through its Solana validator partnership with Kiln. And white label stablecoins make a lot of sense, given how everyone from the Wyoming state government to President Trump-backed World Liberty Financial wants to have a stablecoin. In an interview, M^0 chief strategy officer Joao Reginatto said “a couple of other companies” will be leveraging $M to build stablecoins on Solana. But despite all the buzz, the stablecoin landscape remains pretty duopolistic. 76% of all stablecoins on Solana are Circle’s USDC, and another 18% are Tether’s USDT, according to DeFiLlama. M^0’s clients will hope to unseat Circle — and Solana might hope one of them can do so. Among Solana’s chief competitors is Base, which is operated by Coinbase, the latter of which has a revenue sharing agreement with Circle. “Solana perhaps doesn’t see with very good eyes the widespread use of USDC on Solana” given how some of USDC’s revenue filters back down to Coinbase, Reginatto said.

CMT-Certified Analyst Says $38,000-$42,000 Is Coming",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-eyes-38000-42000/,"The Bitcoin (BTC) price crash to $74,000 has left traders speculating whether the cryptocurrency has finally hit a bottom. However, a CMT-certified analyst suggests that Bitcoin’s price correction is far from over. He has predicted an even deeper pullback to $38,000 – $42,000, which he identifies as Bitcoin’s final price bottom. In a detailed Elliott Wave-based chart analysis, CMT-certified technical analyst Tony Severino outlines a classic 5-wave impulsive structure that appears to have completed its final leg near $85,000. Severino’s analysis highlights that Bitcoin’s latest decline to $74,000 is merely the start of a broader ABC corrective pattern, potentially driving the cryptocurrency down to a bottom in the range of $38,000 – $42,000. New Bitcoin Price Bottom Incoming In Bitcoin’s 5-wave impulse structure, Wave 1 began with a sharp bear market low, followed by Wave 2, a corrective pullback. Wave 3 marked the strongest upward move, subdivided into five smaller waves (i to v). After the market paused briefly for a pullback in Wave 4, Wave 5 kicked off with a final push toward a peak near $85,000.

According to the analyst, the cryptocurrency is currently completing Wave A of this corrective pattern, which is expected to bottom out near $62,000 – $65,000 by June 2025. This price range coincides with the previous main correction zone around Wave 4, which is a common target for Wave A retracements. Notably, a bigger concern comes after Bitcoin’s possible crash to $65,000 – $62,000. The analyst anticipates a short-lived bounce in Wave B, followed by a more pronounced decline in Wave C. This downturn is expected to push the Bitcoin price to its final bottom target between $38,000 and $42,000 by April 2026. This pullback target further aligns with the iv sub-wave of Wave 3, which often serves as a key retracement zone during market corrections. Severino has confirmed through his technical analysis that the market is now in a bear phase. His price chart incorporates cyclical timing models, marking a complete market cycle characterized by a bull market peak in 2025, followed by a bear market extending into mid-2026. This timeline is consistent with Bitcoin’s typical four-year halving cycle, where the market reaches its peak the year after the halving event before entering a bear market phase. Analyst Flags Death Cross In BTC’s Chart According to reports from BarChart on X, Bitcoin has just formed a Death Cross on its price chart for the first time since September 2024. A Death Cross occurs when the 50 Moving Average (MA) crosses below the 200 MA.

Considering Bitcoin’s price has declined to $78,900 at press time, the appearance of a Death Cross indicates a possibility of further breakdown and consolidation.
