South Korea’s Financial Post reported that the Democratic Party, the National Assembly’s biggest party, is currently “considering” issuing a manifesto promise to ditch existing fiat on/off banking rules. Crypto Exchange Deregulation Now Inevitable, Sources Claim The current banking rules require domestic fiat-trading crypto exchanges to partner with a bank that must provide platforms with customer banking services via dedicated crypto wallet -linked bank accounts. Upbit trading volumes over the past 12 months. (Source: CoinGecko) In late April, the ruling People Power Party (PPP) unveiled a host of crypto promises, including a pledge to do away with the rule . If the DP does indeed follow suit, this could mean the end of the era of exclusive banking deals. Instead, exchanges would be free to strike deals with multiple banks. And that could potentially spell trouble for K Bank, whose partnership with the market-leading exchange Upbit has led to exponential growth for both parties. However, the media outlet wrote that the banking sector is now set to “undergo surgery” as “voices urging deregulation grow louder ahead of the presidential election.” Frontrunner Mulls Manifesto Pledge The media outlet claimed that the campaign team of the DP candidate and presidential frontrunner Lee Jae-myung is “strongly considering” making a near-identical pledge. That would all result in K Bank “taking a direct hit,” the outlet continued. Critics have previously claimed that K Bank’s “dependence” on its Upbit-related business could derail its long-running bid to go public. K Bank has been Upbit’s exclusive banking partner since mid-2020. Trades on Upbit account for almost 68% of the current total of the domestic South Korean market.

Regulators are also hinting that they could be prepared to soften their hardline stance on the crypto sector. The same media outlet wrote that the Financial Services Commission (FSC) is now “looking into conditional deregulation measures.” The FSC Chairman Kim Byung-hwan told reporters at a recent press conference: “Since the existing banking rules were introduced to reduce the risk of money laundering, we will need to check to see if banks and exchanges have the systems in place that let them manage all related risks. We will conduct a comprehensive review. And after that, we will decide whether or not we need to improve the current system.” An unnamed financial industry executive told the media outlet: “Since there are so many voices calling for deregulation, we will have no choice but to go in that direction. But we need to gradually ease regulations, while ensuring we make up for any shortcomings.” The post South Korean Crypto Exchange Deregulation Plans Set to Rock Banking Sector appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|Crypto Exchange|South Korea,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-05-13 23:30:00

Insider trading cases, like with $MELANIA, expose the high-risk, high-reward nature of meme-driven markets. Meme coins, once dismissed as fleeting internet jokes, are now outperforming traditional tech-focused cryptocurrencies in 2025. According to crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa, meme coins like Pepe, Bonk, Dogwifhat (WIF), Fartcoin, and Floki are demonstrating greater resilience and investor interest compared to many ‘tech’ altcoins. Sherpa suggests that the enduring appeal of these culturally resonant tokens may give them a longevity that tech-centric coins lack. He said : “There are 10,000 coins and none of them can sustain attention forever. It’s actually why I suspect the bigger, Lindy memes will have better staying power than in the past.

A significant move from within the ranks of a global banking giant signals the continued, perhaps accelerating, shift of top-tier talent towards the crypto space. Andrew Peel, who previously led digital asset markets at Morgan Stanley, has made the leap to establish his own venture in Switzerland, specifically focusing on building bridges between the old and new financial worlds. This departure from Morgan Stanley crypto operations highlights a growing trend: experienced professionals from established financial institutions are increasingly seeing opportunities to innovate and build within the decentralized ecosystem. Andrew Peel’s Bold Leap: From Morgan Stanley Crypto to a Swiss Crypto Investment Firm Andrew Peel’s decision to leave his prominent role at Morgan Stanley is more than just a career change; it’s a statement about where he sees the future of finance heading. His new company, based in the crypto-friendly hub of Zug, Switzerland, is reportedly focused on key areas poised for significant growth: tokenized funds and trading tools designed to connect traditional finance infrastructure with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. This focus on a crypto investment firm structure suggests an intent to not just observe but actively participate in and shape the institutional adoption of digital assets. Peel’s background at a major institution like Morgan Stanley gives him unique insights into the needs, challenges, and opportunities for bringing large-scale capital and complex financial products into the digital asset space. His move underscores the increasing viability and attractiveness of the crypto sector as a place for seasoned finance professionals to build innovative businesses. Building the Essential TradFi DeFi Bridge One of the most exciting, and perhaps necessary, developments for widespread institutional adoption of digital assets is the creation of robust and secure connections between TradFi and DeFi. Peel’s new firm aims squarely at this challenge, focusing on tools that facilitate a seamless TradFi DeFi bridge . What does this bridge entail? Interoperability: Allowing assets and data to flow securely and efficiently between traditional financial systems (like banks, brokers, exchanges) and decentralized networks (like Ethereum, Solana, etc.). Compliance Layers: Integrating necessary regulatory and compliance frameworks (KYC/AML) into decentralized applications and processes to meet institutional requirements. Product Innovation: Creating new financial products, such as tokenized versions of traditional assets or regulated access points to DeFi yield strategies. Infrastructure Development: Building the underlying technology and protocols that support these interactions, ensuring security, scalability, and reliability. This bridging work is crucial because while DeFi offers innovation, efficiency, and transparency, TradFi provides scale, regulatory clarity (in its own domain), and established investor trust. A successful TradFi DeFi bridge can unlock immense liquidity and bring new levels of efficiency to global markets. The Promise and Potential of Tokenized Assets A core focus for Peel’s new venture is tokenized assets . This concept involves representing ownership or rights to real-world assets (like real estate, stocks, bonds, commodities, art, or even intellectual property) as digital tokens on a blockchain. Why is this significant? Increased Liquidity: Traditionally illiquid assets can be fractionalized and traded more easily on digital markets. Improved Efficiency: Transactions can be faster and cheaper by removing intermediaries and automating processes via smart contracts. Greater Accessibility: Fractional ownership allows smaller investors to access high-value assets previously out of reach. Enhanced Transparency: Ownership history and transactions are recorded on a public or permissioned ledger, increasing trust and auditability. Automated Management: Corporate actions, dividend distribution, or royalty payments can potentially be automated using smart contracts. Imagine owning a token representing a share in a piece of prime real estate, or trading tokens backed by a portfolio of corporate bonds. Tokenized assets have the potential to revolutionize capital markets, making them more democratic, efficient, and global. Peel’s focus suggests a belief that institutions will increasingly leverage this technology for asset management and trading. Zug, Switzerland: A Premier Hub for Institutional Crypto Firms The choice of Zug, Switzerland, as the base for Peel’s new company is no accident. Known globally as “Crypto Valley,” Zug has cultivated a reputation as a leading jurisdiction for blockchain and crypto companies. Its attractiveness stems from several factors: Progressive Regulation: Switzerland has taken a proactive and clear approach to regulating blockchain and digital assets, providing legal certainty for businesses operating in the space. Supportive Ecosystem: The region boasts a concentration of blockchain startups, service providers, academic institutions, and government support, fostering innovation and collaboration. Talent Pool: A growing number of skilled professionals with expertise in both finance and technology are based in or attracted to the area. Global Connectivity: Switzerland’s position in Europe and its reputation as a financial center make it an ideal location for a globally focused crypto investment firm . Establishing a firm in Zug positions it within a respected and well-regulated environment, which is crucial for attracting institutional clients and partners looking for compliance and stability in the volatile crypto market. The Accelerating Trend of Institutional Crypto Adoption Andrew Peel’s move is part of a larger, undeniable trend: the increasing involvement of large financial institutions in the crypto space. While initial institutional interest was cautious, focusing primarily on Bitcoin custody or futures, it has rapidly expanded. Today, we see institutions exploring: Direct investments in cryptocurrencies and digital asset funds. Offering crypto trading and brokerage services to clients. Developing blockchain infrastructure for internal processes. Exploring tokenization for various asset classes. Engaging with DeFi protocols for yield generation or lending (albeit often through regulated intermediaries). This growing institutional crypto adoption is driven by several factors, including client demand, the potential for new revenue streams, diversification benefits, and the recognition of blockchain technology’s long-term potential to reshape financial markets. The movement of senior executives like Peel from firms like Morgan Stanley to build native crypto businesses is a strong indicator of the industry’s maturation and future direction. What Does This Institutional Shift Mean for the Market? The influx of institutional players brings both opportunities and challenges. On the one hand, it can lead to increased liquidity, greater market efficiency, enhanced credibility for the asset class, and significant capital inflow. On the other hand, it may also bring increased regulatory scrutiny and potentially centralize aspects of a historically decentralized market. Challenges and Opportunities in Bridging TradFi and DeFi While the potential of a TradFi DeFi bridge is vast, significant hurdles remain. Regulatory clarity is still evolving across different jurisdictions, creating uncertainty. Interoperability between disparate blockchain networks and legacy TradFi systems is technically complex. Security risks associated with smart contracts and digital asset custody require sophisticated solutions. Despite these challenges, the opportunities for innovation in creating new financial products, improving market infrastructure, and expanding access to capital are immense. Firms like the one Peel is launching are at the forefront of tackling these issues. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Evolving Landscape For investors, builders, and participants in both TradFi and DeFi, Andrew Peel’s move and the broader trend of institutional crypto adoption offer key takeaways: Stay Informed: The convergence of TradFi and DeFi is a complex and fast-moving area. Understanding the technical, regulatory, and market developments is crucial. Evaluate New Products: Keep an eye on regulated offerings related to tokenized assets and institutional access to DeFi yield, but exercise due diligence. Understand the Infrastructure: Pay attention to the development of the TradFi DeFi bridge technology, as this infrastructure will underpin future market growth. Recognize Talent Flow: The migration of top TradFi talent into crypto is a bullish signal for the industry’s potential and increasing sophistication. Consider Regulatory Trends: Regulatory developments, particularly in jurisdictions like Switzerland, will significantly impact how institutions engage with digital assets. This period represents a critical phase in the evolution of global finance, where the strengths of traditional systems are being integrated with the innovation of decentralized technology. Conclusion: A New Era for Institutional Digital Assets Andrew Peel’s departure from Morgan Stanley to launch a crypto investment firm in Switzerland focused on tokenized assets and the TradFi DeFi bridge is a powerful symbol of the ongoing institutional embrace of digital assets. It signifies not just interest, but a commitment from experienced finance professionals to build the necessary infrastructure and products for a future where traditional and decentralized finance are seamlessly connected. As more talent flows from Wall Street to “Crypto Valley” and other digital asset hubs, the foundations for widespread institutional crypto adoption are being laid, promising a transformed financial landscape.

A significant event just unfolded on one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, Coinbase, sending ripples through the Crypto Market . We’re talking about a massive withdrawal of Bitcoin , the kind that often signals big moves from big players. What Does a Massive BTC Outflow From Coinbase Mean? According to insights shared by André Dragosch, head of research at Bitwise, on the social platform X, Coinbase Exchange recently witnessed its largest BTC Outflow of 2025. A staggering 9,739 BTC was withdrawn from the platform. But why is an outflow significant? Unlike inflows (deposits), outflows suggest that users are moving their Bitcoin off the exchange, typically into private wallets or cold storage. This action is often interpreted as a sign that the holders intend to keep their Bitcoin for the long term, rather than selling it in the immediate future. Think of an exchange like a marketplace. When goods are taken off the shelves and stored away, it usually means the owner isn’t planning to sell them right away. In the context of Bitcoin , a large outflow reduces the immediate selling pressure on the exchange. Is Growing Institutional Demand Behind This Move? The prevailing sentiment, echoed by Dragosch and many market analysts, is that this particular outflow is a strong indicator of accelerating Institutional Demand . Institutions, such as asset managers, hedge funds, and corporations, typically handle vast amounts of capital. When they acquire Bitcoin , they often prefer to take custody of it themselves or use dedicated institutional-grade custodians rather than leaving large sums on exchange hot wallets, which can be perceived as higher risk. Here are a few reasons why institutions might move large amounts of Bitcoin off exchanges: Security: Holding keys in cold storage or with a trusted custodian is generally considered more secure against exchange hacks or failures. Long-Term Strategy: Institutions buying for long-term investment or HODLing strategies have no immediate need to keep assets on an exchange for trading. Regulatory Compliance: Some institutional mandates or regulatory requirements might necessitate specific custody solutions. Fund Operations: Entities like spot Bitcoin ETFs require custodians to hold the underlying BTC that backs the fund shares. The sheer size of the 9,739 BTC withdrawal from Coinbase in 2025 suggests it wasn’t a single retail investor making the move. This scale points towards a large entity or multiple large entities accumulating Bitcoin and securing their holdings. How Does Increased Institutional Demand Impact the Crypto Market? The growing presence and Institutional Demand for Bitcoin have several potential impacts on the broader Crypto Market : Benefits: Increased Capital Inflow: Institutions bring significant capital, potentially driving up demand and price. Market Maturation: Institutional participation can lead to more sophisticated market infrastructure, regulation, and legitimacy. Reduced Volatility (Potentially): Long-term institutional holders are less likely to engage in frequent trading, potentially reducing short-term price swings compared to speculative retail trading. Validation: Institutional adoption serves as a strong validation of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class, attracting further interest. Challenges: Centralization Concerns: Large holdings by a few entities could raise concerns about market manipulation, although Bitcoin ‘s decentralized nature mitigates this significantly. Market Influence: Large institutional trades can still cause significant short-term price movements. Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased institutional involvement often brings greater regulatory attention, which can be a double-edged sword. This specific BTC Outflow from Coinbase is a tangible example of the trends analysts have been discussing – that institutional players are increasingly active in accumulating Bitcoin . Coinbase’s Role in Institutional Bitcoin Adoption Coinbase has positioned itself as a key gateway for institutions entering the crypto space. Its Coinbase Prime service offers tailored solutions for institutional clients, including trading, custody, and prime brokerage services. This makes Coinbase a natural venue for large institutional purchases and subsequent withdrawals for self-custody or transfer to institutional custodians. The fact that the largest BTC Outflow of 2025 occurred on Coinbase underscores its importance as a platform for institutional activity in the Crypto Market . Actionable Insights for Investors What does this surge in Institutional Demand and large BTC Outflow mean for the average investor? Confirmation of Trend: This event reinforces the narrative that Bitcoin is gaining traction as a legitimate asset class among sophisticated investors. Potential Price Impact: Sustained institutional buying pressure, coupled with reduced supply on exchanges due to outflows, could be bullish for Bitcoin ‘s price in the long term. Consider Long-Term View: Seeing institutions accumulate for the long haul might encourage retail investors to also consider a long-term investment strategy rather than short-term trading. Importance of Self-Custody: The institutional preference for moving BTC off-exchange highlights the importance of self-custody for larger holdings, a practice retail investors can also adopt using hardware wallets. While one large outflow event doesn’t guarantee future price movements, it provides concrete evidence of the increasing sophistication and scale of participation in the Bitcoin market. Event Amount Exchange Significance Largest BTC Outflow (2025 YTD) 9,739 BTC Coinbase Signals strong Institutional Demand In Conclusion: A Bullish Signal? The massive 9,739 Bitcoin outflow from Coinbase, the largest recorded in 2025 so far, is more than just a statistic; it’s a powerful signal. It points towards accelerating Institutional Demand for Bitcoin , with large players actively accumulating and securing their holdings off-exchange. This trend is a significant factor shaping the Crypto Market , potentially driving future growth and validating Bitcoin ‘s role as a store of value and a strategic asset. As institutions continue to enter the space, events like this BTC Outflow from major platforms like Coinbase will likely become more frequent, underscoring the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency investment.

In the latest State of Crypto report, the firm noted that Solana outperformed Coinbase and Ethereum in transaction volume in the first two months of 2025. According to the report , Solana processed $364.34 billion in transaction volume in January and February 2025, enough to put it ahead of Coinbase and Ethereum. Only Nasdaq, with $647.36 billion, was ahead of the network. Solana had $364.34 million in transaction volume for the first two months of 2025 (Source: 21 Shares) This has led to a comparison between the two, with experts saying Solana could become Nasdaq onchain. The report stated: “Solana is now the most-used network in the world, boasting over 100M monthly active users. At its peak in January and February 2025, Solana processed $364B in volume-more than half of Nasdaq’s exchange volume.” 21 Shares analysts added that this performance aligns with the network growth trajectory since emerging from the ashes of FTX collapse. Since then, the network has seen a surge in almost all metrics, with capital deployed soaring more than 2,000% to almost $7 billion, while its native token SOL peaked at $263 earlier this year. Interestingly, stablecoin activity on the network has also increased substantially, growing 600% in the last 12 months from $2.16 billion to over $12 billion. What is driving Solana’s growth Meanwhile, the report focused extensively on the factors driving Solana’s growth over the past two years, noting that its infrastructure, transaction speed, and low fees are among the reasons. In comparison with other networks, Solana’s average block time of 0.44 seconds is only bested by Sui, with 0.21 seconds among the major smart contract networks. The blockchain can also handle up to 65,000 transactions per second and has an average transaction fee of only $0.03 However, the reason for the network’s growth extends beyond its infrastructural capacity, given that emerging networks such as Sui can rival it in this area. Its success is also a testament to its user experience and focus on partnerships. The report stated that Solana’s strategic partnerships with enterprises are also crucial to its performance. These partnerships with PayPal, First Digital, Visa, Stripe, and Shopify mean millions of users rely on the network settlement capacities. It said: “Solana’s technical supremacy and enterprise partnerships cement its role as the backbone of next-gen payment systems and retail-focused blockchain adoption.” Additionally, the report noted that more developers are building on Solana, pointing to the 83% growth in its developer base last year. This marks the first time another network will beat Ethereum in new developer growth. With developers building on Solana, the network has seen an influx of new products in all categories, such as decentralized finance (DeFi), decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN), AI, and memecoins. The report particularly highlighted memecoins as a growth catalyst and ultimate stress test for the network. What is next for the SOL price? Meanwhile, 21 Shares analysts believe that SOL might be undervalued, with its fair value between $520 and $1,800, depending on the growth rate. This estimate is based on a discounted cash flow model. It said: “Though based on TradFi valuation principles, which may not fully translate to crypto, this approach underscores Solana’s intrinsic value through real revenue generation.” With these estimates, the firm believes that SOL value could grow significantly, especially as it attracts more activity and increases on-chain activity. However, Solana is not expected to flip Ethereum in the market cap anytime soon, even if its growth trajectory impacts Ethereum’s dominance. At the time of the report in late April, SOL was trading at $152.72, and its market cap was around 34% of Ethereum’s. Since then, both assets have seen substantial growth in value, with SOL now worth $182.51 while ETH has increased by 50% in the past seven days to $2,692.

44587610,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=160053,1747180241,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,BitGo Partnership Seals Upexi’s Bold Crypto Custody & Solana Strategy,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitgo-upexi-crypto-custody/,"In a significant move highlighting the increasing convergence of traditional business and the digital asset world, cryptocurrency custody firm BitGo has inked a strategic deal with e-commerce company Upexi . This partnership is set to provide essential crypto custody and over-the-counter (OTC) trading services, supporting Upexi’s recently announced focus on cryptocurrency asset management. What Does This Partnership Mean for Upexi and BitGo? The core of this collaboration centers on BitGo providing its institutional-grade digital asset services to Upexi . For Upexi , an e-commerce company known for acquiring and scaling Amazon and Shopify brands, this marks a clear strategic pivot into the cryptocurrency space. By leveraging BitGo’s robust infrastructure, Upexi aims to securely manage its growing digital asset portfolio. Key aspects of the partnership include: Secure Custody: BitGo will provide secure storage solutions for Upexi’s digital assets, mitigating risks associated with holding large amounts of cryptocurrency. OTC Trading Access: Upexi gains access to BitGo’s OTC trading services, allowing for large-volume trades to be executed efficiently and with minimal market impact, crucial for managing significant positions. Foundation for Growth: The partnership provides Upexi with the necessary institutional-grade tools to confidently expand its digital asset holdings and management strategies. For BitGo , this deal further solidifies its position as a leading provider of crypto custody and financial services for institutional and corporate clients venturing into the digital asset market. Why is Upexi Betting Big on Solana (SOL)? A notable element of Upexi’s new digital asset strategy is its significant focus on Solana (SOL) . The company recently disclosed a substantial increase in its Solana holdings, accumulating 595,000,000 SOL, valued at approximately $100 million at the time of the announcement. This positions Upexi as a major holder of the high-performance blockchain’s native token. Upexi’s decision to concentrate on Solana is reportedly tied to a Solana -based financial strategy. While specific details of this strategy are yet to be fully unveiled, it suggests Upexi may be exploring opportunities within the Solana ecosystem, such as DeFi applications, NFTs, or other potential use cases that align with its business model or investment goals. The choice of Solana indicates a belief in the network’s scalability, speed, and growing ecosystem. The Importance of Institutional Crypto Custody As more corporations and institutions explore integrating digital assets into their balance sheets or business operations, the need for secure and compliant crypto custody solutions becomes paramount. Holding millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency requires specialized security infrastructure, insurance, and regulatory compliance that differs significantly from traditional asset management. This is where firms like BitGo play a critical role. They provide the necessary technological and operational frameworks to protect digital assets from theft, loss, or unauthorized access. For a company like Upexi , transitioning from e-commerce to managing significant crypto holdings, partnering with a trusted custodian like BitGo is a fundamental step to ensure asset safety and build confidence for stakeholders. Navigating Large Trades with OTC Trading Executing large buy or sell orders directly on public cryptocurrency exchanges can lead to significant price slippage and market disruption. This is why OTC trading desks are essential for institutional players. OTC trading allows parties to trade directly with each other, typically facilitated by a broker or a firm like BitGo , outside of the open exchange order books. For Upexi , which plans to potentially increase its Solana holdings further, using BitGo’s OTC trading services enables them to acquire or divest large amounts of SOL discreetly and at negotiated prices, minimizing the impact on the broader market price of Solana . This is a standard practice for large investors and a key service offered by institutional crypto platforms. Looking Ahead: Upexi’s Digital Asset Future With the BitGo partnership in place, Upexi is well-equipped to pursue its ambition of expanding its digital asset portfolio. The company has stated its intention to manage its existing holdings and potentially acquire more Solana . This strategic shift by a non-crypto native company highlights a broader trend of diversification and exploration of value within the digital asset landscape. The success of Upexi’s Solana -based strategy and its digital asset management through BitGo will be closely watched. It could serve as an interesting case study for other e-commerce or traditional businesses considering a similar move into the crypto market. The partnership underscores the growing demand for institutional-grade infrastructure to support this evolution. Conclusion: A Strategic Alignment for Growth The partnership between BitGo and Upexi represents a strategic alignment that provides Upexi with the secure foundation needed to execute its ambitious Solana -focused digital asset strategy. By leveraging BitGo ‘s expertise in crypto custody and OTC trading , Upexi is positioning itself to navigate the complexities of the cryptocurrency market confidently. This collaboration not only benefits both companies but also signals the continued maturation and institutional adoption of the digital asset ecosystem, particularly highlighting the increasing interest in platforms like Solana among corporate entities.

Bitcoin Investors With 10 to 10,000 BTC Have Expanded Holdings Recently In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has talked about the latest trend in the supply held by Bitcoin’s key investors: those holding between between 10 and 10,000 BTC. Related Reading: Bitcoin Near ATH, But Still No Extreme Greed: Green Sign For Bull Run? At the current exchange rate, this range converts to $1 million at the lower end and $1 billion at the upper end. Thus, the only investors who would be able to qualify for it would be the ones with substantial holdings. Generally, the influence of any entity in the market goes up the more supply that they control, so the holders belonging to this range would hold an important place in the ecosystem. Collectively, these investors are popularly known as the sharks and whales. Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm, which shows the trend in the Supply Distribution for the sharks and whales, an indicator that tracks the combined supply held by members of these cohorts: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin sharks and whales have seen their Supply Distribution go up recently, which suggests these large investors have been expanding their holdings. More specifically, the investors falling in the 10 to 10,000 BTC range have added around 83,100 tokens to their wallets over the past month. This accumulation hasn’t come in a constant manner, however, as these investors in fact reduced their supply for a period earlier in the month. This selling from the cohorts followed BTC’s recovery beyond $97,000, so it’s likely that the motive behind it was profit-taking. From the chart, it’s also visible that this selloff resulted in a pullback for the cryptocurrency. During the latest renewal of bullish momentum, the sharks and whales have again resumed their Bitcoin accumulation and have notably surpassed their holdings from the earlier peak. So far, the groups have shown no signs of profit-taking, which can naturally be a bullish sign for the rally’s sustainability. Related Reading: XRP Target Could Be $15 If This Pattern Is In Play, Analyst Says In the same chart, Santiment has also attached the data for the Supply Distribution of the investors carrying less than 0.1 BTC. Interestingly, these investors have been selling while the sharks and whales have gone through accumulation. This could be an indication that the shrimps believe the top could be in soon. Given the accumulation from the large investors, though, the analytics firm notes, “it may be a matter of time until Bitcoin’s coveted $110K all-time high level is breached, particularly after the U.S. & China tariff pause.” BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $103,800, up 11% in the last seven days.

Trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 785,900 followers on the social media platform X that he’s extremely bullish on the crypto market as mainstream institutional players begin to embrace the asset class. According to Van de Poppe, conditions in the crypto market are reminiscent of the Dot-com era, when tech and web-based firms saw their valuation skyrocket as investors piled in and became overexuberant on the emerging sector. “All I know: This is the cycle where everything is going to go ballistic. Higher than ever. The Dot-com bubble type of cycle for crypto, where there’s a lot of liquidity flowing into this asset class and a lot of adoption. It’s basically the only asset class to be significantly outperforming everything.” The Dot-com bubble exploded in 2000, destroying $5 trillion in wealth and driving thousands of companies into bankruptcy. One altcoin on the trader’s radar for a potential repeat of the Dot-com bubble is payments altcoin XRP . Van de Poppe predicts that the coin will come close to its all-time high (ATH) of $3.40. “When things go absolutely vertical, that’s the moment where you want to zoom out and get higher time frame entry points. The same applied for XRP. Marked the level around $1.75 as an important one for entries and it’s up 50% since. I assume we’ll attack the ATHs soon.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, XRP is worth $2.52. The trader is also bullish on the Solana ( SOL ) rival Sei ( SEI ). Van de Poppe predicts that SEI will rally by as much as 169% from current levels. “Indeed, break and flip and the next target is $0.30. I think that SEI will be trending up significantly more. First stop is $0.30, after that a slight correction for people to jump into the asset and then we’ll continue towards the $0.50-0.70 range. ” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, SEI is worth $0.26.

44588308,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=160054,1747180838,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Pioneering: Gibraltar Launches World’s First Crypto Derivatives Clearing Framework,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/gibraltar-crypto-clearing-framework/,"Get ready for a significant leap forward in the world of digital assets! Gibraltar, a jurisdiction known for its forward-thinking approach to crypto regulation, has just announced a groundbreaking initiative. They are set to introduce the world’s first regulatory framework specifically designed for the clearing and settlement of crypto derivatives. This isn’t just another piece of regulation; it’s a move poised to bring a new level of stability and trust to a rapidly evolving market, particularly concerning Gibraltar crypto derivatives trading. Understanding the Need for a Crypto Clearing Framework Before diving into the specifics of Gibraltar’s announcement, let’s talk about why clearing is so crucial, especially in the context of volatile markets like cryptocurrency. In traditional finance, clearing houses sit between buyers and sellers of derivatives contracts (like futures and options). Their primary role is to guarantee the transaction, even if one party defaults. This process, known as central clearing, significantly reduces ‘counterparty risk’ – the risk that the other side of your trade won’t fulfill their obligations. In the burgeoning crypto derivatives market, counterparty risk has been a persistent concern. While many platforms offer derivatives trading, the lack of a standardized, regulated clearing mechanism leaves participants exposed. If a large trading firm or even an exchange itself faces financial distress, it can have cascading effects, potentially leaving other market participants with unrealized losses. Gibraltar’s proposed crypto clearing framework aims to address this head-on. By establishing clear rules and requirements for entities acting as clearing houses for virtual asset derivatives, they are essentially building a safety net. This framework is being developed through a collaboration between the Government of Gibraltar, the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission (GFSC), and Bullish, a crypto exchange with a focus on institutional-grade infrastructure. This partnership brings together regulatory expertise and practical market experience. How Will the Virtual Asset Clearing Framework Work? The core idea behind Gibraltar’s initiative is to adapt well-established principles from traditional financial market clearing to the unique characteristics of virtual assets. While the full details of the framework are yet to be unveiled, we can anticipate key elements based on standard clearing house operations and the information available: Central Counterparty Role: Recognized clearing houses will act as central counterparties (CCPs), becoming the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer. This mutualizes and manages risk. Risk Management: The framework will likely mandate robust risk management procedures for clearing houses, including margin requirements, default management protocols, and stress testing. Segregation of Assets: Rules will likely require the segregation of customer assets from the clearing house’s own funds, providing an extra layer of protection in case of insolvency. Transparency: The framework is expected to enhance market transparency by providing a clearer picture of outstanding positions and risk exposures to regulators and market participants. Eligibility Criteria: There will be stringent requirements for entities seeking recognition as virtual asset clearing houses under the framework. According to reports, the framework specifically targets the clearing and settlement of virtual asset derivative contracts. This means contracts like futures, options, and perpetual swaps whose value is derived from underlying cryptocurrencies or other virtual assets. By focusing on this segment, Gibraltar is addressing one of the riskiest, yet increasingly popular, areas of the crypto market. Benefits of Regulated Digital Asset Clearing Introducing a regulated framework for clearing virtual asset derivatives offers a multitude of benefits for the market and participants: Reduced Counterparty Risk: This is the most significant benefit. By having a regulated clearing house guarantee trades, participants are protected from the default of their individual trading partner. Increased Market Integrity: Central clearing brings standardization and oversight, making the market more robust and less susceptible to manipulation or systemic failure. Enhanced Transparency: Clearing houses provide a central point for monitoring exposures, which can give regulators and market participants better insights into market health and potential risks. Greater Investor Protection: With clear rules and risk management procedures, investors and traders have greater confidence that their trades will be honored. Potential for Institutional Adoption: Traditional financial institutions are often hesitant to engage in unregulated markets due to compliance and risk constraints. A regulated clearing framework can significantly lower this barrier, potentially unlocking substantial institutional capital for Gibraltar crypto derivatives and the wider virtual asset market. Improved Liquidity: As confidence and participation grow, the market becomes more liquid, leading to tighter spreads and better execution prices for traders. Attracting Business to Gibraltar: By being the first to offer such a framework, Gibraltar positions itself as a leader in regulated crypto finance, potentially attracting businesses and talent to the jurisdiction. This move is a clear signal that Gibraltar is serious about fostering a mature, responsible, and sustainable digital asset ecosystem. It builds upon their existing Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) regulatory framework, which has been in place since 2018. Potential Challenges and Considerations While the prospect of regulated digital asset clearing is exciting, implementing such a framework is not without its challenges: Complexity of Virtual Assets: Crypto markets operate 24/7, are highly volatile, and involve various types of assets and networks. Adapting traditional clearing systems, designed for markets with defined trading hours and established assets, requires significant technical and operational innovation. Cross-Border Issues: Crypto markets are global. How will Gibraltar’s framework interact with regulations (or lack thereof) in other jurisdictions? This could create complexities for international firms. Attracting Clearing Houses: Will there be sufficient interest from entities willing and able to meet the stringent requirements to become recognized clearing houses for virtual assets? Technology Integration: Clearing houses will need sophisticated technology to manage the unique aspects of crypto derivatives, including potentially handling settlement in various cryptocurrencies or stablecoins. Regulatory Arbitrage: While Gibraltar leads, the absence of similar frameworks elsewhere could potentially push some activity to less regulated venues, at least in the short term. These are challenges that the GFSC and its partners will need to carefully navigate as they finalize and implement the framework. The collaboration with Bullish suggests a practical approach, leveraging market participant insights to build a workable system. Gibraltar’s Strategic Move in Crypto Derivatives Regulation Gibraltar has consistently aimed to be a reputable hub for digital finance. Its existing DLT framework was one of the first of its kind globally, providing a clear regulatory path for businesses using blockchain technology. Launching the first crypto derivatives regulation specifically for clearing is a logical next step and reinforces this ambition. By focusing on clearing, Gibraltar is targeting a critical piece of financial infrastructure. This is not just about allowing trading; it’s about making trading safer and more reliable. This focus on infrastructure-level regulation is arguably more impactful than simply licensing trading platforms. This framework could serve as a blueprint for other jurisdictions considering how to regulate the complex world of crypto derivatives. As institutional interest in crypto grows, the demand for regulated, secure trading and clearing solutions will only increase. Gibraltar is positioning itself to meet that demand. What This Means for the Market For traders and investors, this framework could mean access to more reliable and less risky ways to trade crypto derivatives. While the initial impact might be on larger, institutionally focused platforms operating under the framework, the increased market maturity and reduced systemic risk could benefit the entire ecosystem in the long run. For crypto businesses, particularly those involved in derivatives, Gibraltar offers a potentially attractive jurisdiction to operate within a clear, regulated environment. This could encourage more sophisticated products and services to be developed and offered under robust oversight. For other regulators, Gibraltar’s approach provides a real-world example of how traditional financial regulation principles can be adapted to the unique challenges of virtual assets. It highlights the importance of focusing on core financial infrastructure like clearing to build a safer market. The development of this framework is a significant step towards bridging the gap between traditional finance and the digital asset space. It acknowledges the growing importance of crypto derivatives while putting essential safeguards in place. Conclusion: A New Era for Crypto Derivatives? Gibraltar’s announcement of the world’s first regulatory framework for clearing and settlement of crypto derivatives is a landmark moment. It signals a maturation of the digital asset market and a proactive approach from regulators to build essential financial infrastructure. By focusing on reducing counterparty risk and enhancing market integrity through regulated clearing houses, Gibraltar is setting a precedent that could influence how other jurisdictions approach crypto derivatives regulation .

The current Mantra (OM) price analysis shows a coin stuck in a holding pattern, trying to break above key levels. Meanwhile, the Ethereum (ETH) price update has caught investor attention, with ETH jumping 7% thanks to the Pectra upgrade. Both tokens have setups worth watching, though each comes with its level of risk. Meanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) is gaining traction due to its Buyer Battles and the current price $0.0262 in batch 28. Traders climb the leaderboard to score massive daily rewards, including unclaimed coins. BlockDAG’s thoughtful design and growing community give it a solid reputation as the best crypto platform. OM Price Stuck Near Resistance With Mixed Signals The latest Mantra (OM) price analysis reveals a coin in limbo. Trading at $0.3636, Mantra recently saw its volume spike nearly 69% in one day before sliding back, suggesting traders are paying attention. According to recent Mantra price analysis, the coin bounced off support but continues to stall under the $0.42 resistance zone. If OM can break through that barrier, analysts say a run to $0.45 or even $0.48 could follow. But there are caution signs too. The OM price still struggles with a high fully diluted valuation compared to its total value locked. Profit-taking and macro headwinds might cap any near-term rally. Until OM clears that $0.42 line, the upside comes with hesitation. ETH Price Update: Pectra Upgrade Sparks Investor Confidence The newest Ethereum (ETH) price update comes as the Pectra upgrade lands, bringing serious improvements to how users interact with the network. ETH is now trading at $1,958, up nearly 7% in 24 hours. This bump follows the merger of Prague and Electra into a new upgrade suite called Pectra, which includes easier wallet features and gas payments in multiple tokens. One key change, the validator cap moving from 32 ETH to 2,048, caters to larger holders like ETF issuers. As this Ethereum (ETH) price update notes, investor interest is growing, with over 3.5 million ETH accumulated in under two months. Short-term targets now hover around $2,200 and $4,000. BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles Turn Trading Into a Race BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles are making crypto buying feel like a high-stakes contest. Every day, 25 million BDAG coins hit the presale market. Buyers rush in, and anything left behind? It goes straight to the biggest spender of the day, no paperwork, no fine print, just pure reward. That’s helped push total presale funds past $241 million, with more than 20.1 billion BDAG coins already sold. Those who joined early? They’re sitting on a 2,520% ROI. And with the current batch price $0.0262 to the launch price $0.05, today’s buyers can lock in over 90% ROI. This competitive format is creating real winners. If just 20% of that day’s allocation goes unclaimed, the top buyer could walk away with nearly $131K worth of BDAG at the batch price of $0.0262, or as much as $250K if the coin launches at $0.05. Veteran buyers are circling back to protect their spots, while new players are jumping in to grab BDAG on the cheap. Social media buzzes every night as wallets battle it out before the midnight UTC deadline. For anyone looking for the best crypto platform that combines utility and excitement, BlockDAG is making its case in real time. What Should Traders Watch Now? Traders are eyeing two key markers this week: OM trying to clear $0.42, and ETH aiming for $2,200. The Mantra (OM) price analysis remains cautiously optimistic, while the Ethereum (ETH) price update shows solid growth potential thanks to Pectra. But the real energy is flowing toward BlockDAG. With Buyer Battles driving daily action, the current batch 28th price $0.0262, and a chance to claim unclaimed coins, BDAG offers a different momentum. With early buyers already up 2,520%, those on the sidelines might want to act before May 13 closes the window.

Investors felt safe keeping most of their wealth in U.S.-based assets for years because of the country’s strong economy, stable currency, and deep financial markets. Still, recent trade disputes, new tariffs, and concerns about the long-term strength of the dollar are crushing their confidence. UBS clients reduce U.S.-dollar exposure as volatility rises The co-head of wealth management for Asia at USB, Amy Lo, said that the company’s wealthy clients are pulling away from U.S.-dollar investments as they feel uneasy about putting too much of their money in assets tied to the U.S. dollar amid global economic uncertainty and the ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China . Amy Lo also noted that most of their clients are turning to gold because it isn’t tied to any single government or currency, while others are putting their cash in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are becoming more widely accepted as alternative assets that balance traditional portfolios. Pro-crypto lawyer and strong advocate for XRP holders, John Deaton, even commented in a post on X saying, “We have officially reached the point where it is far more riskier to have zero exposure to Crypto than it is to allocate a small percentage of your net worth to it.” Clients are also looking for opportunities that offer growth without relying on the U.S. economy alone, which makes them more focused on managing risks and not just chasing high returns. UBS and other wealth management firms stated that these investors are adopting structured asset allocation models that spread risk more evenly. Morgan Stanley, for example, recommends a 40-40-15 split whereby 40% of your assets are in fixed-income bonds, another 40% in equities or stocks, and 15% in alternative investments like private equity or hedge funds, with the remaining 5% held in cash or cash-like assets in case of market downturns. Investors regain confidence in China and shift allocations Many wealthy investors who avoided the Chinese market for the past few years because of poor performance, strict regulations, and ongoing tensions with the United States are now slowly shifting their money back into Chinese assets due to strong stock performance, a more positive trade environment , and innovations from Chinese companies. Hong Kong’s stock market, the Hang Send Index (HSI) , is one of the best-performing stock indexes in the world in 2025, and Amy Lo explains that clients are now asking her directly about investment opportunities in the country after years of avoiding anything to do with China. This shift shows how quickly investor sentiment can change when signs of progress and stability appear. The recent tariff truce between the U.S. and China helped cool down some trade war tensions that affected global markets. The United States lowered its tariffs on most Chinese imports from 145% to 30% for 90 days, while China cut down its duties from 125% to 10% and agreed to remove some of their countermeasures set in 2018, which gave investors hope that trade will continue to improve and make China a more attractive opportunity. A private wealth management expert at Morgan Stanley believes that the recent trade agreement between China and the U.S. has created new growth opportunities in both countries and that repositioning investor interest back to China is simultaneous with a recovery in U.S. growth stocks. Morgan Stanley expects its high-net-worth clients will earn 7% to 8% in total annual returns over the next seven to ten years, but Christina warns that achieving these returns is now more difficult because of volatile markets. For this reason, clients are now rethinking how much risk they are taking, how their portfolios are balanced, and what role each type of investment plays in helping them meet their financial goals.

This milestone marks a decentralized network overtaking one of China's largest technology companies in market value. Concurrently, Ethereum's market cap has also exceeded that of Coca-Cola. The surge in Ethereum's valuation has been accompanied by substantial buying activity from Abraxas Capital, a London-based asset management firm. Over the past six days, Abraxas Capital has acquired nearly $500 million worth of Ethereum, purchasing over 211,000 ETH. The firm reportedly borrowed $240 million in USDT from the decentralized lending platform Aave and transferred it to Binance, suggesting continued accumulation of Ethereum assets. This buying spree coincides with Ethereum's price rally past $2,600. There is speculation about the identity and motives of Abraxas Capital, with some noting previous transactions linking it to Alameda Research before the latter's collapse.

For those tracking technological advancements, particularly in areas like Generative AI , the impact is becoming increasingly visible across various sectors. This trend is now significantly influencing how we consume literature, with Audible, Amazon’s prominent audiobook service, making a major move to leverage AI. What is Audible Doing with AI Narration? Audible recently announced a strategic initiative to partner with publishers to convert print and e-books into audiobooks using AI narration . This approach is designed to rapidly expand Audible’s content library. In a competitive market against platforms like Apple and Spotify, a larger, diverse catalog is a key differentiator. By utilizing artificial intelligence, Audible can streamline the production process, making it faster and potentially more cost-effective for publishers to turn written works into audio experiences. This expansion leverages sophisticated AI capabilities developed by Amazon. Publishers collaborating with Audible have access to a variety of AI-generated voices. Currently, over 100 different AI voices are available, supporting English, French, Spanish, and Italian languages, with options for various accents and dialects. Audible has indicated plans to increase the selection of voices and languages over time, enhancing the versatility of its Audible AI platform. How Does Amazon AI Power This? The core technology enabling this initiative comes from Amazon’s extensive AI research and development. Amazon AI provides the underlying infrastructure and models required for high-quality text-to-speech conversion. This isn’t Audible’s first foray into using synthetic voices. In 2023, Amazon launched an invite-only beta program featuring a ‘virtual voice’ tool aimed at self-published authors in the U.S. This tool allowed independent creators to transform their e-books into audiobooks using synthetic speech technology, significantly lowering the barrier to entry for audiobook production. The adoption of this ‘virtual voice’ technology by self-published authors highlights its practical benefits. A search on Audible reveals tens of thousands of titles explicitly labeled as narrated by ‘Virtual Voice’. This demonstrates that the technology is popular, especially among authors who might lack the financial resources or time typically required for traditional audiobook narration, which involves hiring professional voice actors and studio time. AI audiobooks produced this way offer a scalable solution for content creators. Are There Concerns About AI Audiobooks? Despite the clear advantages in speed and scale, the widespread introduction of AI-generated narrations has sparked considerable discussion and debate within the publishing industry and among listeners. Critics frequently voice concerns regarding the potential impact of these AI recordings on the overall quality and artistic integrity of audiobooks. Professional narrators, in particular, have raised questions about the nuances, emotional depth, and performance aspects that human narrators bring to a text, which AI might struggle to replicate convincingly. It’s worth noting that Audible has also explored partnerships with human narrators in the context of AI. Last year, Audible reportedly invited a group of audiobook narrators to participate in training AI models on their voices, suggesting an interest in developing more sophisticated or personalized AI narration capabilities, potentially blurring the lines between fully synthetic and AI-assisted narration. What About AI Translation? Looking ahead, Audible is also planning to introduce Generative AI capabilities for translation later in the year. A beta version of AI translation services is expected to roll out, offering both text-to-text and speech-to-speech translation. Initially, this will support translations from English into Spanish, French, Italian, and German. This feature could open up vast libraries of content to new language markets without the need for manual translation and re-narration. Recognizing the critical need for accuracy in translation, especially for published works, Audible plans to offer publishers the option to engage professional linguists to review and refine these AI-generated translations. This hybrid approach aims to combine the speed and efficiency of AI with human expertise to ensure quality and fidelity to the original text. How Does Audible Compare to Competitors? The move towards AI narration is not unique to Audible. Spotify, which has emerged as the second-largest provider of audiobooks after Audible, has also recently invested efforts into expanding its audiobook catalog using AI tools. In February, Spotify announced a partnership with ElevenLabs, a prominent AI audio technology provider. This indicates that the use of artificial intelligence for content creation, specifically in the audiobook space, is becoming a key area of competition among major platforms. The competition between Audible and Spotify, fueled by advancements in Amazon AI and other AI technologies, is likely to accelerate the production and availability of audiobooks globally. While the debate over AI narration quality continues, the accessibility and speed offered by this technology are undeniable drivers of market expansion. Conclusion: The Future of AI Audiobooks Audible’s aggressive expansion of its AI audiobooks library marks a significant moment in the evolution of digital content. By leveraging Generative AI and Amazon AI , Audible is not only aiming to boost its catalog size but also potentially reshape the economics and accessibility of audiobook production for publishers and authors alike. While concerns about quality and the role of human narrators persist, the efficiency and scale offered by AI narration are poised to make audiobooks more widely available than ever before. As the technology improves and translation capabilities are added, we can expect AI to play an even larger role in how stories are told and heard across the globe.

44588469,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=160056,1747182033,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,AI Export Rules: Trump Administration Abruptly Halts Biden Policy,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-halts-ai-rules/,"In a move that has significant implications for the technology sector, particularly concerning advanced AI development and the global supply chain for critical components, the Trump administration AI team has officially reversed a key policy introduced by the previous administration. After a period of speculation, the U.S. Department of Commerce formally rescinded the Biden Administration’s Artificial Intelligence Diffusion Rule. This rule, part of the broader Biden AI policy , was poised to introduce new export limitations on U.S.-made AI chips to various countries and strengthen existing controls, marking a pivotal shift in how the U.S. managed its technological exports. Understanding the Previous Biden AI Policy The Artificial Intelligence Diffusion Rule, championed under the Biden AI policy and scheduled to take effect soon after its announcement in January, represented a structured approach to controlling the proliferation of advanced AI technology. It was designed to limit the ability of certain nations to access cutting-edge AI chips , which are essential for training sophisticated AI models. The core of the rule involved a tiered system categorizing countries based on perceived risk levels regarding technology diffusion: Tier 1 Countries: Nations considered close allies, such as Japan and South Korea, would have faced minimal to no new restrictions on receiving U.S. AI chips . Tier 2 Countries: This group included countries like Mexico and Portugal. For the first time, these regions would have encountered specific limits on the export of certain AI technologies and components. Tier 3 Countries: Countries deemed adversaries or high-risk, including China and Russia, would have seen existing controls tightened significantly, making it even harder for them to acquire advanced U.S. AI chips . This tiered approach aimed to balance national security concerns with international cooperation, but it also generated debate about its potential impact on global technology markets and research collaborations. Why the Trump Administration AI Team Reversed Course On Tuesday, the US Commerce Department , now operating under the directive of the Trump administration, announced that it had instructed its staff not to implement or enforce the Biden-era regulation. This decision effectively puts the brakes on the structured tiered system just days before its planned implementation. U.S. Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Security Jeffery Kessler provided insight into the rationale behind this abrupt change. He stated that the Trump administration AI strategy would pursue a different path, focusing on a “bold, inclusive strategy to American AI technology with trusted foreign countries around the world.” This contrasts with the blanket restrictions proposed under the previous Biden AI policy . Kessler explicitly rejected the Biden administration’s approach, labeling it “ill-conceived and counterproductive AI policies.” The administration appears to favor direct, country-by-country negotiations and targeted agreements rather than broad, predefined restrictions. This suggests a potential shift towards a more flexible, perhaps more politically driven, approach to managing technology exports and international AI collaboration. What’s Next for AI Chips and Export Controls? With the rescission of the Biden-era rule, the immediate future of U.S. AI export rules is somewhat uncertain, though the US Commerce Department has indicated its intentions. While the specific regulation is gone, the underlying concerns about technology transfer remain. The DOC plans to develop and issue a replacement rule in the future. In the interim, the US Commerce Department released guidance to the industry, emphasizing existing regulations and potential risks. Key points highlighted include: A reminder that using Huawei’s Ascend AI chips anywhere globally constitutes a violation of current U.S. export regulations. A warning about the significant potential consequences for U.S. companies if their AI chips are discovered being used to train AI models in China, underscoring the ongoing sensitivity around advanced AI development in that region. Recommendations for companies to enhance measures protecting their chip supply chains from diversion tactics, ensuring technology does not end up in unauthorized hands or locations. This guidance suggests that while the *method* of control is changing, the *goal* of preventing adversaries from accessing advanced U.S. AI chips remains a priority for the Trump administration AI strategy. The Implications of Changing AI Export Rules The sudden change in AI export rules has several potential implications: Industry Uncertainty: Companies involved in semiconductor manufacturing, AI hardware, and related software face uncertainty as they await the new framework. Planning global sales and partnerships becomes more complex without clear, long-term regulations. Geopolitical Dynamics: The shift from a tiered system to direct negotiations could alter diplomatic relations and technology partnerships. It might offer more flexibility but could also lead to inconsistent policies across different countries. Pace of Innovation: Some argue that blanket restrictions can slow down global AI development. A move towards more targeted controls, if implemented effectively, might potentially facilitate certain international collaborations, though national security remains a tight constraint. Competitive Landscape: The policy changes could impact the competitive positioning of U.S. companies versus international rivals in the AI chips market. The stated aim of the Trump administration AI approach is to be “inclusive” with trusted partners while keeping technology from adversaries. The success of this approach will depend heavily on the specifics of the forthcoming replacement rule and the effectiveness of direct negotiations. Conclusion: A New Era for AI Technology Policy The formal rescission of the Biden Administration’s Artificial Intelligence Diffusion Rule by the US Commerce Department marks a significant pivot in U.S. technology export policy. The structured, tiered approach of the Biden AI policy is being replaced by what the Trump administration AI team suggests will be a more flexible strategy centered on direct engagement and targeted controls.

Tether snapped up 4,812.2 Bitcoin ( BTC ) at $95,319 each and transferred it to an escrow wallet on May 9, Cantor Equity Partners disclosed in a May 13 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. It brings Twenty One’s total Bitcoin holdings to 36,312 BTC, as Cantor Equity Partners holds 31,500 BTC on behalf of the firm, which will trade under the ticker XXI once the SPAC merger is complete. Twenty One’s CEO, Jack Mallers, said on May 13 that they’re already in the approval process of the merger, but didn’t give an exact estimate on when the transaction would be complete. Twenty One is already the third largest corporate Bitcoin holder, trailing only Strategy and Bitcoin mining firm MARA Holdings at 568,840 Bitcoin and 48,237 Bitcoin, respectively, BitcoinTreasuries.net data shows. Tether is a majority stakeholder in Twenty One alongside crypto exchange Bitfinex. The Wall Street heavyweight Cantor Fitzgerald is sponsoring the merger, providing financial advisory services and securing $585 million in funding to support Twenty One’s Bitcoin investments. Japanese investment holding firm SoftBank also invested $900 million into Twenty One, which is led by Strike CEO Jack Mallers. Strategy may have a legitimate competitor Twenty One said in an April presentation to the SEC that is looking to supplant Michael Saylor’s Strategy , formerly MicroStrategy, to become the “superior vehicle” for investors seeking “capital-efficient Bitcoin exposure.” The company is among many Bitcoin buying firms , but promises to be a “pure play” for investors seeking Bitcoin exposure with Bitcoin-native operations and more flexibility for strategic capital raises.

The latest wave of innovation is hitting how we consume media, and one exciting development comes from the realm of music streaming. Spotify is rolling out a significant update to its Spotify AI DJ feature, introducing interactive voice commands. This isn’t just about listening; it’s about telling your AI what you want to hear, marking a leap forward in personalized audio experiences. How Spotify AI DJ Voice Commands Work The Spotify AI DJ , first launched in early 2023, initially served as a curated stream with commentary. Now, it’s evolving into a truly interactive assistant. The core functionality revolves around using your voice to influence the music being played. Here’s a breakdown: Initiating the DJ: You can find the AI DJ by typing “DJ” in the Spotify search bar. Making Voice Requests: Once the DJ is active, you can hold down the dedicated DJ button (typically located on the bottom right) to speak your commands. What You Can Request: Users can ask the AI DJ to play specific songs, request tracks from particular artists, change the current genre, or even alter the overall mood of the playlist it’s generating. Quick Mood Change: If you don’t have a specific voice request but want to quickly shift the vibe, a quick press of the DJ button can prompt the AI to transition to a different style or mood. This feature is currently rolling out in over 60 markets, initially supporting English voice commands. This expansion makes the interactive AI DJ accessible to a much wider global audience, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with streaming technology . The Benefits of Enhanced Music Personalization Why is adding voice commands to the Spotify AI DJ such a big deal? It significantly enhances the user experience through deeper music personalization . Here are some key benefits: Effortless Control: Change the music without needing to navigate menus or type searches. Ideal for when you’re driving, cooking, or otherwise occupied. Dynamic Discovery: Instead of passively listening, you can actively guide the AI to explore different genres, artists, or moods on the fly, leading to more tailored music discovery. More Engaging Experience: The ability to talk to your AI DJ makes the interaction feel more like having a personal curator who responds to your immediate preferences. Instant Adaptation: Your mood can change rapidly. Voice commands allow the AI DJ to adapt almost instantly, ensuring the music always fits the moment. This level of control moves beyond traditional algorithmic playlists, offering a more fluid and responsive way to interact with Spotify’s vast library and the potential of AI music curation. The Technology Powering AI Music Interaction While the user experience is simple, the technology behind the Spotify AI DJ and its new voice capabilities is complex. It involves a combination of advanced AI models: Speech Recognition: Converting spoken voice commands into text or actionable instructions. Natural Language Processing (NLP): Understanding the intent and context of user requests, even if phrased casually or ambiguously. Recommendation Engines: Leveraging Spotify’s extensive data on user listening habits, musical attributes, and trends to select appropriate songs based on the voice commands. Generative AI (for commentary): While not directly tied to voice commands, the original DJ feature used generative AI to create the spoken commentary between songs, adding to the personalized feel. Integrating these components allows the AI DJ to not just understand what you say but also make intelligent decisions about the music it plays next, creating a seamless blend of user input and algorithmic curation. This sophisticated use of AI music technology is a testament to the potential of AI in enhancing digital services. Comparing Spotify’s AI DJ to Other AI Features Spotify isn’t new to leveraging AI. Besides the Spotify AI DJ , the company also introduced a feature allowing users to create playlists using text prompts. How does the interactive AI DJ with voice commands stack up? Text Prompt Playlists: This feature is great for creating a playlist based on a specific theme, activity, or mood described in text. It’s useful for building a static collection. Interactive AI DJ: The AI DJ is designed for dynamic, real-time listening. Voice commands allow for instant adjustments and continuous discovery within a live stream, rather than building a fixed list. Complementary Tools: These features serve different purposes. The text prompt tool is for curation and collection building, while the AI DJ with voice is for live, adaptive playback and exploration. Both features demonstrate Spotify’s commitment to using AI to improve music personalization , offering users different ways to interact with and discover music based on their needs and preferences at any given moment. They represent different facets of how streaming technology is evolving. Future Outlook and Potential Challenges The introduction of voice commands for the Spotify AI DJ opens up exciting possibilities for the future of music streaming. Imagine a truly conversational AI DJ that can discuss music, provide trivia, or even help you discover artists based on subtle nuances in your requests. However, there are potential challenges: Accuracy of Voice Recognition: Ensuring the AI accurately understands commands across different accents, languages, and background noise is crucial for user satisfaction. Natural Language Understanding: The AI needs to handle complex or ambiguous requests gracefully. Scalability: Rolling out sophisticated AI features like this globally, especially with multilingual support, requires significant infrastructure and ongoing development. User Adoption: Will users readily adopt talking to their music app? The feature needs to provide clear value and ease of use. Despite these challenges, the trajectory suggests a future where our interactions with streaming technology become increasingly intuitive and personalized, with AI music curators playing a central role. Actionable Insights for Users Ready to try out the new interactive Spotify AI DJ ? Here’s how you can make the most of the new voice commands : Experiment with Requests: Don’t just ask for specific songs. Try asking the DJ to “play something upbeat,” “switch to jazz,” or “play more songs like this one.” Refine Your Language: Pay attention to how the AI responds to different phrasing and adjust your commands for better results. Use the Quick Press: When you’re unsure what you want but need a change, a quick press of the DJ button is an easy way to refresh the music. Provide Feedback: While not a direct voice command feature, using Spotify’s feedback mechanisms can help improve the AI over time. Embracing these interactive features allows you to take greater control of your listening experience and unlock deeper levels of music personalization provided by this evolving AI music feature. Conclusion: A New Era of Music Interaction Spotify’s integration of voice commands into its Spotify AI DJ is a significant step forward in the evolution of music streaming. It transforms a passive listening experience into an interactive one, offering users unprecedented control over their real-time music personalization . This move highlights the growing impact of AI on how we interact with digital content and services.

Enter Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a low-priced token rapidly gaining attention from those who saw DOGE transform $5,000 into $300,000 in just six months. With its innovative approach to decentralized finance and the backing of a passionate community, MUTM is emerging as the next big opportunity. The project is already at Phase 4 of its presale and has already raised more than $8 million and more than 9,700 investors. With over 70% sold out during this stage, the price will go up by 20% to $0.03 in Phase 5 and with an expected launch price of $0.06. As crypto enthusiasts and Dogecoin investors look for the next big breakout, MUTM is shaping up to be a serious coin, potentially delivering gains that could rival DOGE’s past meteoric rise. Mutuum Finance: A New Era in DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance is not another DeFi wave-rider project it provides a twin lending mechanism incorporating Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) capabilities. The hybrid system offers stability as well as control to users. P2C Lending enables investors to receive yield by providing stablecoins such as USDT to lending pools that are governed by smart contracts, providing a safe and automated means of earning passive income. In contrast, P2P Lending allows direct borrowing and lending relations between users with no middlemen. This aspect enhances privacy and allows for more personalized lending, giving users more control over the transaction. Through this novel setup Mutuum Finance is now a viable and scalable product within the DeFi ecosystem. It is also currently undergoing a third-party audit by Certik to further enhance transparency and investor trust. Presale Growth and Launch Price Expectations Currently, at $0.025, the MUTM token is highly sought after. Those who invest now at this stage in Phase 4 are set to appreciate by 20% once Phase 5 begins. The market launch price is at $0.06, but some crypto analysts are already predicting it is going to be up within no time after its release, an exponential rise compared to today’s prices in the presale. These are the explanations why MUTM is one of the most debated low-price DeFi coins. Fueling Growth Through Community and Rewards The platform is also developing a thriving community with reward-based mechanics. There is an active leaderboard that shows the top 50 token holders and rewarding them with additional MUTM tokens. In addition, there is a token giveaway with a $100,000 prize ongoing, in which ten winners will receive $10,000 each in MUTM. A referral program also incentivizes user growth by rewarding participants who refer new users to the platform. Why Investors Are Taking Notice Mutuum Finance is becoming one of the most sensational early-stage decentralized finance opportunities. As the token draws near its next price milestone and launch, early investors would be much better off enjoying token appreciation along with platform rewards. Just as Dogecoin turned early believers into crypto legends, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now drawing in a new wave of investors chasing outsized gains, with some eyeing the potential to flip $5K into $300K within months. Already raising $8M+ from over 9,700 backers, and with Phase 4 over 70% sold out, MUTM is proving it’s not just hype, it’s momentum backed by innovation. With the next phase bringing a 20% price increase, and a launch target of $0.06, today’s entry point at $0.025 could be the last chance for investors to get in at the ground floor. Don’t wait until MUTM is trending, move now or risk missing the next DOGE-sized breakout.

Currently priced at $2.52 , XRP has dropped 3.05% in the last 24 hours , with a $147.33 billion market cap . While Ripple’s regulatory clarity has boosted investor confidence, its massive market cap limits its growth potential. Enter Ruvi . This presale crypto is going to outperform Ripple and deliver crazy returns. It’s early stage innovation + bonus packed presale = can’t miss opportunity for forward thinking investors. Ripple’s Past Success vs Ruvi’s Future Ripple’s blockchain has revolutionized cross border payments with its speed and scalability. Recent SEC clarity has solidified its position as a regulated crypto, attracting institutional interest. But here’s the thing: Ripple’s massive market cap means there’s limited room for the exponential gains we saw in its early days. Ruvi is in its early stage . By getting in on Ruvi’s presale you’re basically buying into the beginning of what could be the next XRP like success story. With its AI driven features and blockchain efficiencies Ruvi is going to disrupt the industry in ways Ripple can no longer. Where Ruvi Stands Out: Presale Bonuses A key difference?

44589606,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=160069,1747184406,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Thailand Digital Bond: Unlocking $150M G-Token Opportunity,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/thailand-digital-bond-g-token/,"Are you interested in how traditional finance is converging with the world of digital assets? A significant development is unfolding in Southeast Asia, as Thailand takes a bold step into the realm of tokenized government bond issuances. The news centers around the planned issuance of a substantial Thailand digital bond , specifically a digital investment token dubbed the G-Token, by the nation’s Finance Ministry. What is the Planned G-Token Thailand Issuance? According to reports from Bloomberg, Thailand’s Finance Ministry is preparing to issue 5 billion baht, which translates to approximately $150 million USD, through a digital investment token known as the G-Token. This initiative was highlighted by Thailand’s Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister, Pichai Chunhavajira. He indicated that the G-Token issuance is expected to occur within the next two months, forming a part of the government’s broader budget borrowing strategy. The core idea behind this G-Token issuance is to leverage digital technology to streamline and potentially enhance the traditional bond market. While specific technical details about the underlying platform (likely a form of distributed ledger technology or blockchain) are still emerging, the focus is clearly on creating a digital representation of a sovereign debt instrument. Why Issue a Tokenized Government Bond? Exploring the Benefits The move towards a tokenized government bond offers several potential advantages, both for the issuer (the Thai government) and for investors. The Finance Minister pointed to a couple of key benefits directly: Accessibility for Small Investors: One significant aspect mentioned is that investors will be able to participate in the G-Token bond issuance with relatively small amounts of cash. Traditional government bonds often require high minimum investment thresholds, limiting access for individual retail investors. Tokenization, by allowing for fractional ownership, can democratize access to these financial instruments. Boosting Secondary Market Trading: The digital token format is anticipated to potentially boost secondary market bond trading. Tokenization can facilitate faster settlement times and potentially increase liquidity compared to traditional bond markets, which can sometimes be less efficient, especially for smaller trades. Beyond these specific points, the general benefits often associated with tokenizing assets, including bonds, can include: Increased Transparency: Transactions recorded on a distributed ledger can offer greater transparency (depending on the specific setup). Improved Efficiency: Automated processes via smart contracts can reduce manual effort and costs. 24/7 Trading Potential: Digital markets can theoretically operate around the clock, unlike traditional markets with set hours. Sovereign Digital Bond: Part of a Global Trend? Thailand’s plan to issue a sovereign digital bond is not happening in a vacuum. Governments and international financial institutions globally have been exploring or implementing similar initiatives. Examples include the European Investment Bank (EIB) which has issued digital bonds on a blockchain platform, and the World Bank which has also experimented with bond tokenization. These moves signal a growing interest among sovereign and quasi-sovereign entities in exploring how digital ledger technology can be applied to traditional capital markets. While each implementation varies in design and purpose, the overarching theme is the exploration of technology to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and potentially broaden investor bases for government debt. Implications for Thailand Blockchain Finance This G-Token issuance represents a significant step for the landscape of Thailand blockchain finance . It signals the government’s willingness to embrace digital asset technology beyond just cryptocurrencies, applying it to core financial infrastructure like debt markets. This could have several ripple effects: Validation: A government-backed digital asset issuance lends credibility to the broader blockchain and digital asset ecosystem within Thailand. Infrastructure Development: It may necessitate or accelerate the development of necessary digital infrastructure, regulatory frameworks, and technical expertise within the country. Innovation Catalyst: It could encourage further innovation and adoption of blockchain technology by private sector financial institutions in Thailand. This move aligns with Thailand’s broader digital transformation goals and its efforts to position itself as a technologically advanced nation in the region. Potential Challenges and Considerations While the benefits are promising, the path to successful implementation of a Thailand digital bond is not without potential challenges. These could include: Regulatory Clarity: Ensuring the appropriate legal and regulatory framework is in place for digital bonds. Investor Education: Educating both institutional and retail investors about this new format of investment. Technology Risk: Ensuring the underlying technology is secure, reliable, and scalable. Market Adoption and Liquidity: Building sufficient interest and infrastructure to ensure a liquid secondary market develops as hoped. Careful planning and execution will be crucial to navigate these potential hurdles. A Compelling Step Forward Thailand’s plan to issue a $150 million G-Token digital bond is a noteworthy development in the convergence of traditional finance and digital assets. By potentially lowering the barrier to entry for investors and aiming to enhance secondary market trading, this initiative could serve as a significant case study for how governments can leverage tokenization for sovereign debt. It underscores the growing relevance of blockchain and digital asset technology in mainstream financial markets and marks a positive stride for Thailand blockchain finance on the global stage.

The analyst still expects XRP to rally to four digits and has in the past explained why he believes such an ambitious price target is possible. XRP Price To Still Rally To $1,000 In an X post, BarriC stated that a potential XRP price rally to between $10 and $20 is just the beginning. He added that the long game for the altcoin is $1,000. The analyst urged market participants to be prepared for life-changing and generational wealth. In his other X posts, BarriC provided a roadmap for how it can reach four digits. Related Reading: Analyst Says These Factors Will Drive XRP Price To $1,000, But What Does Market Cap Say? In one post, he stated that once the XRP price reclaims $3, it will move rapidly to $5. The analyst predicts that the altcoin will then skyrocket into double digits, sitting comfortably at between $10 and $20 as a new all-time high. However, BarriC believes that is just the start for XRP as it will still reach $100 and then $1,000. He asserted that these price targets for XRP will happen much sooner than people think. In another post, the analyst alluded to banks using XRP as one factor that could spark this XRP price surge. BarriC stated that the fact that investors can still accumulate the altcoin at around $2 means that banks aren’t utilizing it yet. The analyst said that once banks and financial institutions worldwide adopt and utilize XRP in the way they conduct finance, the altcoin will skyrocket to $1,000. He referenced the 2017 bull cycle when the token’s price went from $0.006 to $3.80, which is why he is confident that such a parabolic surge is possible. The Altcoin Approaching Key Resistance Levels In an X post, crypto analyst CasiTrades stated that the XRP price is approaching key resistance levels following its latest surge. She highlighted $2.69 as the major resistance, as this price level is also the .236 Fib retracement from the all-time high (ATH) and a key level to watch for a correction. Related Reading: XRP Price To $1,000: Analyst Reveals Target For When Banks Start Using XRP Commenting on the current price action, she noted that what stands out is the continued price increase despite low momentum and a completed 5-wave count. The analyst remarked that this slow, controlled push higher often signals strong underlying demand, strong trend, and heavy accumulation. CasiTrades stated that if the XRP price breaks and holds above $2.69, it would open the door for an explosive move toward $3. However, if the altcoin doesn’t hold this level, she claimed it could record a short-term dip toward $2.30 for a reset. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.50, up almost 5% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.
