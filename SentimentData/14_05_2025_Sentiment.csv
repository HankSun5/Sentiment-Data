South Korea’s Financial Post reported that the Democratic Party, the National Assembly’s biggest party, is currently “considering” issuing a manifesto promise to ditch existing fiat on/off banking rules. Crypto Exchange Deregulation Now Inevitable, Sources Claim The current banking rules require domestic fiat-trading crypto exchanges to partner with a bank that must provide platforms with customer banking services via dedicated crypto wallet -linked bank accounts. Upbit trading volumes over the past 12 months. (Source: CoinGecko) In late April, the ruling People Power Party (PPP) unveiled a host of crypto promises, including a pledge to do away with the rule . If the DP does indeed follow suit, this could mean the end of the era of exclusive banking deals. Instead, exchanges would be free to strike deals with multiple banks. And that could potentially spell trouble for K Bank, whose partnership with the market-leading exchange Upbit has led to exponential growth for both parties. However, the media outlet wrote that the banking sector is now set to “undergo surgery” as “voices urging deregulation grow louder ahead of the presidential election.” Frontrunner Mulls Manifesto Pledge The media outlet claimed that the campaign team of the DP candidate and presidential frontrunner Lee Jae-myung is “strongly considering” making a near-identical pledge. That would all result in K Bank “taking a direct hit,” the outlet continued. Critics have previously claimed that K Bank’s “dependence” on its Upbit-related business could derail its long-running bid to go public. K Bank has been Upbit’s exclusive banking partner since mid-2020. Trades on Upbit account for almost 68% of the current total of the domestic South Korean market.

Regulators are also hinting that they could be prepared to soften their hardline stance on the crypto sector. The same media outlet wrote that the Financial Services Commission (FSC) is now “looking into conditional deregulation measures.” The FSC Chairman Kim Byung-hwan told reporters at a recent press conference: “Since the existing banking rules were introduced to reduce the risk of money laundering, we will need to check to see if banks and exchanges have the systems in place that let them manage all related risks. We will conduct a comprehensive review. And after that, we will decide whether or not we need to improve the current system.” An unnamed financial industry executive told the media outlet: “Since there are so many voices calling for deregulation, we will have no choice but to go in that direction. But we need to gradually ease regulations, while ensuring we make up for any shortcomings.” The post South Korean Crypto Exchange Deregulation Plans Set to Rock Banking Sector appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|Crypto Exchange|South Korea,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-05-13 23:30:00

Insider trading cases, like with $MELANIA, expose the high-risk, high-reward nature of meme-driven markets. Meme coins, once dismissed as fleeting internet jokes, are now outperforming traditional tech-focused cryptocurrencies in 2025. According to crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa, meme coins like Pepe, Bonk, Dogwifhat (WIF), Fartcoin, and Floki are demonstrating greater resilience and investor interest compared to many ‘tech’ altcoins. Sherpa suggests that the enduring appeal of these culturally resonant tokens may give them a longevity that tech-centric coins lack. He said : “There are 10,000 coins and none of them can sustain attention forever. It’s actually why I suspect the bigger, Lindy memes will have better staying power than in the past.

A significant move from within the ranks of a global banking giant signals the continued, perhaps accelerating, shift of top-tier talent towards the crypto space. Andrew Peel, who previously led digital asset markets at Morgan Stanley, has made the leap to establish his own venture in Switzerland, specifically focusing on building bridges between the old and new financial worlds. This departure from Morgan Stanley crypto operations highlights a growing trend: experienced professionals from established financial institutions are increasingly seeing opportunities to innovate and build within the decentralized ecosystem. Andrew Peel’s Bold Leap: From Morgan Stanley Crypto to a Swiss Crypto Investment Firm Andrew Peel’s decision to leave his prominent role at Morgan Stanley is more than just a career change; it’s a statement about where he sees the future of finance heading. His new company, based in the crypto-friendly hub of Zug, Switzerland, is reportedly focused on key areas poised for significant growth: tokenized funds and trading tools designed to connect traditional finance infrastructure with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. This focus on a crypto investment firm structure suggests an intent to not just observe but actively participate in and shape the institutional adoption of digital assets. Peel’s background at a major institution like Morgan Stanley gives him unique insights into the needs, challenges, and opportunities for bringing large-scale capital and complex financial products into the digital asset space. His move underscores the increasing viability and attractiveness of the crypto sector as a place for seasoned finance professionals to build innovative businesses. Building the Essential TradFi DeFi Bridge One of the most exciting, and perhaps necessary, developments for widespread institutional adoption of digital assets is the creation of robust and secure connections between TradFi and DeFi. Peel’s new firm aims squarely at this challenge, focusing on tools that facilitate a seamless TradFi DeFi bridge . What does this bridge entail? Interoperability: Allowing assets and data to flow securely and efficiently between traditional financial systems (like banks, brokers, exchanges) and decentralized networks (like Ethereum, Solana, etc.). Compliance Layers: Integrating necessary regulatory and compliance frameworks (KYC/AML) into decentralized applications and processes to meet institutional requirements. Product Innovation: Creating new financial products, such as tokenized versions of traditional assets or regulated access points to DeFi yield strategies. Infrastructure Development: Building the underlying technology and protocols that support these interactions, ensuring security, scalability, and reliability. This bridging work is crucial because while DeFi offers innovation, efficiency, and transparency, TradFi provides scale, regulatory clarity (in its own domain), and established investor trust. A successful TradFi DeFi bridge can unlock immense liquidity and bring new levels of efficiency to global markets. The Promise and Potential of Tokenized Assets A core focus for Peel’s new venture is tokenized assets . This concept involves representing ownership or rights to real-world assets (like real estate, stocks, bonds, commodities, art, or even intellectual property) as digital tokens on a blockchain. Why is this significant? Increased Liquidity: Traditionally illiquid assets can be fractionalized and traded more easily on digital markets. Improved Efficiency: Transactions can be faster and cheaper by removing intermediaries and automating processes via smart contracts. Greater Accessibility: Fractional ownership allows smaller investors to access high-value assets previously out of reach. Enhanced Transparency: Ownership history and transactions are recorded on a public or permissioned ledger, increasing trust and auditability. Automated Management: Corporate actions, dividend distribution, or royalty payments can potentially be automated using smart contracts. Imagine owning a token representing a share in a piece of prime real estate, or trading tokens backed by a portfolio of corporate bonds. Tokenized assets have the potential to revolutionize capital markets, making them more democratic, efficient, and global. Peel’s focus suggests a belief that institutions will increasingly leverage this technology for asset management and trading. Zug, Switzerland: A Premier Hub for Institutional Crypto Firms The choice of Zug, Switzerland, as the base for Peel’s new company is no accident. Known globally as “Crypto Valley,” Zug has cultivated a reputation as a leading jurisdiction for blockchain and crypto companies. Its attractiveness stems from several factors: Progressive Regulation: Switzerland has taken a proactive and clear approach to regulating blockchain and digital assets, providing legal certainty for businesses operating in the space. Supportive Ecosystem: The region boasts a concentration of blockchain startups, service providers, academic institutions, and government support, fostering innovation and collaboration. Talent Pool: A growing number of skilled professionals with expertise in both finance and technology are based in or attracted to the area. Global Connectivity: Switzerland’s position in Europe and its reputation as a financial center make it an ideal location for a globally focused crypto investment firm . Establishing a firm in Zug positions it within a respected and well-regulated environment, which is crucial for attracting institutional clients and partners looking for compliance and stability in the volatile crypto market. The Accelerating Trend of Institutional Crypto Adoption Andrew Peel’s move is part of a larger, undeniable trend: the increasing involvement of large financial institutions in the crypto space. While initial institutional interest was cautious, focusing primarily on Bitcoin custody or futures, it has rapidly expanded. Today, we see institutions exploring: Direct investments in cryptocurrencies and digital asset funds. Offering crypto trading and brokerage services to clients. Developing blockchain infrastructure for internal processes. Exploring tokenization for various asset classes. Engaging with DeFi protocols for yield generation or lending (albeit often through regulated intermediaries). This growing institutional crypto adoption is driven by several factors, including client demand, the potential for new revenue streams, diversification benefits, and the recognition of blockchain technology’s long-term potential to reshape financial markets. The movement of senior executives like Peel from firms like Morgan Stanley to build native crypto businesses is a strong indicator of the industry’s maturation and future direction. What Does This Institutional Shift Mean for the Market? The influx of institutional players brings both opportunities and challenges. On the one hand, it can lead to increased liquidity, greater market efficiency, enhanced credibility for the asset class, and significant capital inflow. On the other hand, it may also bring increased regulatory scrutiny and potentially centralize aspects of a historically decentralized market. Challenges and Opportunities in Bridging TradFi and DeFi While the potential of a TradFi DeFi bridge is vast, significant hurdles remain. Regulatory clarity is still evolving across different jurisdictions, creating uncertainty. Interoperability between disparate blockchain networks and legacy TradFi systems is technically complex. Security risks associated with smart contracts and digital asset custody require sophisticated solutions. Despite these challenges, the opportunities for innovation in creating new financial products, improving market infrastructure, and expanding access to capital are immense. Firms like the one Peel is launching are at the forefront of tackling these issues. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Evolving Landscape For investors, builders, and participants in both TradFi and DeFi, Andrew Peel’s move and the broader trend of institutional crypto adoption offer key takeaways: Stay Informed: The convergence of TradFi and DeFi is a complex and fast-moving area. Understanding the technical, regulatory, and market developments is crucial. Evaluate New Products: Keep an eye on regulated offerings related to tokenized assets and institutional access to DeFi yield, but exercise due diligence. Understand the Infrastructure: Pay attention to the development of the TradFi DeFi bridge technology, as this infrastructure will underpin future market growth. Recognize Talent Flow: The migration of top TradFi talent into crypto is a bullish signal for the industry’s potential and increasing sophistication. Consider Regulatory Trends: Regulatory developments, particularly in jurisdictions like Switzerland, will significantly impact how institutions engage with digital assets. This period represents a critical phase in the evolution of global finance, where the strengths of traditional systems are being integrated with the innovation of decentralized technology. Conclusion: A New Era for Institutional Digital Assets Andrew Peel’s departure from Morgan Stanley to launch a crypto investment firm in Switzerland focused on tokenized assets and the TradFi DeFi bridge is a powerful symbol of the ongoing institutional embrace of digital assets. It signifies not just interest, but a commitment from experienced finance professionals to build the necessary infrastructure and products for a future where traditional and decentralized finance are seamlessly connected. As more talent flows from Wall Street to “Crypto Valley” and other digital asset hubs, the foundations for widespread institutional crypto adoption are being laid, promising a transformed financial landscape.

A significant event just unfolded on one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, Coinbase, sending ripples through the Crypto Market . We’re talking about a massive withdrawal of Bitcoin , the kind that often signals big moves from big players. What Does a Massive BTC Outflow From Coinbase Mean? According to insights shared by André Dragosch, head of research at Bitwise, on the social platform X, Coinbase Exchange recently witnessed its largest BTC Outflow of 2025. A staggering 9,739 BTC was withdrawn from the platform. But why is an outflow significant? Unlike inflows (deposits), outflows suggest that users are moving their Bitcoin off the exchange, typically into private wallets or cold storage. This action is often interpreted as a sign that the holders intend to keep their Bitcoin for the long term, rather than selling it in the immediate future. Think of an exchange like a marketplace. When goods are taken off the shelves and stored away, it usually means the owner isn’t planning to sell them right away. In the context of Bitcoin , a large outflow reduces the immediate selling pressure on the exchange. Is Growing Institutional Demand Behind This Move? The prevailing sentiment, echoed by Dragosch and many market analysts, is that this particular outflow is a strong indicator of accelerating Institutional Demand . Institutions, such as asset managers, hedge funds, and corporations, typically handle vast amounts of capital. When they acquire Bitcoin , they often prefer to take custody of it themselves or use dedicated institutional-grade custodians rather than leaving large sums on exchange hot wallets, which can be perceived as higher risk. Here are a few reasons why institutions might move large amounts of Bitcoin off exchanges: Security: Holding keys in cold storage or with a trusted custodian is generally considered more secure against exchange hacks or failures. Long-Term Strategy: Institutions buying for long-term investment or HODLing strategies have no immediate need to keep assets on an exchange for trading. Regulatory Compliance: Some institutional mandates or regulatory requirements might necessitate specific custody solutions. Fund Operations: Entities like spot Bitcoin ETFs require custodians to hold the underlying BTC that backs the fund shares. The sheer size of the 9,739 BTC withdrawal from Coinbase in 2025 suggests it wasn’t a single retail investor making the move. This scale points towards a large entity or multiple large entities accumulating Bitcoin and securing their holdings. How Does Increased Institutional Demand Impact the Crypto Market? The growing presence and Institutional Demand for Bitcoin have several potential impacts on the broader Crypto Market : Benefits: Increased Capital Inflow: Institutions bring significant capital, potentially driving up demand and price. Market Maturation: Institutional participation can lead to more sophisticated market infrastructure, regulation, and legitimacy. Reduced Volatility (Potentially): Long-term institutional holders are less likely to engage in frequent trading, potentially reducing short-term price swings compared to speculative retail trading. Validation: Institutional adoption serves as a strong validation of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class, attracting further interest. Challenges: Centralization Concerns: Large holdings by a few entities could raise concerns about market manipulation, although Bitcoin ‘s decentralized nature mitigates this significantly. Market Influence: Large institutional trades can still cause significant short-term price movements. Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased institutional involvement often brings greater regulatory attention, which can be a double-edged sword. This specific BTC Outflow from Coinbase is a tangible example of the trends analysts have been discussing – that institutional players are increasingly active in accumulating Bitcoin . Coinbase’s Role in Institutional Bitcoin Adoption Coinbase has positioned itself as a key gateway for institutions entering the crypto space. Its Coinbase Prime service offers tailored solutions for institutional clients, including trading, custody, and prime brokerage services. This makes Coinbase a natural venue for large institutional purchases and subsequent withdrawals for self-custody or transfer to institutional custodians. The fact that the largest BTC Outflow of 2025 occurred on Coinbase underscores its importance as a platform for institutional activity in the Crypto Market . Actionable Insights for Investors What does this surge in Institutional Demand and large BTC Outflow mean for the average investor? Confirmation of Trend: This event reinforces the narrative that Bitcoin is gaining traction as a legitimate asset class among sophisticated investors. Potential Price Impact: Sustained institutional buying pressure, coupled with reduced supply on exchanges due to outflows, could be bullish for Bitcoin ‘s price in the long term. Consider Long-Term View: Seeing institutions accumulate for the long haul might encourage retail investors to also consider a long-term investment strategy rather than short-term trading. Importance of Self-Custody: The institutional preference for moving BTC off-exchange highlights the importance of self-custody for larger holdings, a practice retail investors can also adopt using hardware wallets. While one large outflow event doesn’t guarantee future price movements, it provides concrete evidence of the increasing sophistication and scale of participation in the Bitcoin market. Event Amount Exchange Significance Largest BTC Outflow (2025 YTD) 9,739 BTC Coinbase Signals strong Institutional Demand In Conclusion: A Bullish Signal? The massive 9,739 Bitcoin outflow from Coinbase, the largest recorded in 2025 so far, is more than just a statistic; it’s a powerful signal. It points towards accelerating Institutional Demand for Bitcoin , with large players actively accumulating and securing their holdings off-exchange. This trend is a significant factor shaping the Crypto Market , potentially driving future growth and validating Bitcoin ‘s role as a store of value and a strategic asset. As institutions continue to enter the space, events like this BTC Outflow from major platforms like Coinbase will likely become more frequent, underscoring the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency investment.

In the latest State of Crypto report, the firm noted that Solana outperformed Coinbase and Ethereum in transaction volume in the first two months of 2025. According to the report , Solana processed $364.34 billion in transaction volume in January and February 2025, enough to put it ahead of Coinbase and Ethereum. Only Nasdaq, with $647.36 billion, was ahead of the network. Solana had $364.34 million in transaction volume for the first two months of 2025 (Source: 21 Shares) This has led to a comparison between the two, with experts saying Solana could become Nasdaq onchain. The report stated: “Solana is now the most-used network in the world, boasting over 100M monthly active users. At its peak in January and February 2025, Solana processed $364B in volume-more than half of Nasdaq’s exchange volume.” 21 Shares analysts added that this performance aligns with the network growth trajectory since emerging from the ashes of FTX collapse. Since then, the network has seen a surge in almost all metrics, with capital deployed soaring more than 2,000% to almost $7 billion, while its native token SOL peaked at $263 earlier this year. Interestingly, stablecoin activity on the network has also increased substantially, growing 600% in the last 12 months from $2.16 billion to over $12 billion. What is driving Solana’s growth Meanwhile, the report focused extensively on the factors driving Solana’s growth over the past two years, noting that its infrastructure, transaction speed, and low fees are among the reasons. In comparison with other networks, Solana’s average block time of 0.44 seconds is only bested by Sui, with 0.21 seconds among the major smart contract networks. The blockchain can also handle up to 65,000 transactions per second and has an average transaction fee of only $0.03 However, the reason for the network’s growth extends beyond its infrastructural capacity, given that emerging networks such as Sui can rival it in this area. Its success is also a testament to its user experience and focus on partnerships. The report stated that Solana’s strategic partnerships with enterprises are also crucial to its performance. These partnerships with PayPal, First Digital, Visa, Stripe, and Shopify mean millions of users rely on the network settlement capacities. It said: “Solana’s technical supremacy and enterprise partnerships cement its role as the backbone of next-gen payment systems and retail-focused blockchain adoption.” Additionally, the report noted that more developers are building on Solana, pointing to the 83% growth in its developer base last year. This marks the first time another network will beat Ethereum in new developer growth. With developers building on Solana, the network has seen an influx of new products in all categories, such as decentralized finance (DeFi), decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN), AI, and memecoins. The report particularly highlighted memecoins as a growth catalyst and ultimate stress test for the network. What is next for the SOL price? Meanwhile, 21 Shares analysts believe that SOL might be undervalued, with its fair value between $520 and $1,800, depending on the growth rate. This estimate is based on a discounted cash flow model. It said: “Though based on TradFi valuation principles, which may not fully translate to crypto, this approach underscores Solana’s intrinsic value through real revenue generation.” With these estimates, the firm believes that SOL value could grow significantly, especially as it attracts more activity and increases on-chain activity. However, Solana is not expected to flip Ethereum in the market cap anytime soon, even if its growth trajectory impacts Ethereum’s dominance. At the time of the report in late April, SOL was trading at $152.72, and its market cap was around 34% of Ethereum’s. Since then, both assets have seen substantial growth in value, with SOL now worth $182.51 while ETH has increased by 50% in the past seven days to $2,692.

44587610,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=160053,1747180241,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,BitGo Partnership Seals Upexi’s Bold Crypto Custody & Solana Strategy,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitgo-upexi-crypto-custody/,"In a significant move highlighting the increasing convergence of traditional business and the digital asset world, cryptocurrency custody firm BitGo has inked a strategic deal with e-commerce company Upexi . This partnership is set to provide essential crypto custody and over-the-counter (OTC) trading services, supporting Upexi’s recently announced focus on cryptocurrency asset management. What Does This Partnership Mean for Upexi and BitGo? The core of this collaboration centers on BitGo providing its institutional-grade digital asset services to Upexi . For Upexi , an e-commerce company known for acquiring and scaling Amazon and Shopify brands, this marks a clear strategic pivot into the cryptocurrency space. By leveraging BitGo’s robust infrastructure, Upexi aims to securely manage its growing digital asset portfolio. Key aspects of the partnership include: Secure Custody: BitGo will provide secure storage solutions for Upexi’s digital assets, mitigating risks associated with holding large amounts of cryptocurrency. OTC Trading Access: Upexi gains access to BitGo’s OTC trading services, allowing for large-volume trades to be executed efficiently and with minimal market impact, crucial for managing significant positions. Foundation for Growth: The partnership provides Upexi with the necessary institutional-grade tools to confidently expand its digital asset holdings and management strategies. For BitGo , this deal further solidifies its position as a leading provider of crypto custody and financial services for institutional and corporate clients venturing into the digital asset market. Why is Upexi Betting Big on Solana (SOL)? A notable element of Upexi’s new digital asset strategy is its significant focus on Solana (SOL) . The company recently disclosed a substantial increase in its Solana holdings, accumulating 595,000,000 SOL, valued at approximately $100 million at the time of the announcement. This positions Upexi as a major holder of the high-performance blockchain’s native token. Upexi’s decision to concentrate on Solana is reportedly tied to a Solana -based financial strategy. While specific details of this strategy are yet to be fully unveiled, it suggests Upexi may be exploring opportunities within the Solana ecosystem, such as DeFi applications, NFTs, or other potential use cases that align with its business model or investment goals. The choice of Solana indicates a belief in the network’s scalability, speed, and growing ecosystem. The Importance of Institutional Crypto Custody As more corporations and institutions explore integrating digital assets into their balance sheets or business operations, the need for secure and compliant crypto custody solutions becomes paramount. Holding millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency requires specialized security infrastructure, insurance, and regulatory compliance that differs significantly from traditional asset management. This is where firms like BitGo play a critical role. They provide the necessary technological and operational frameworks to protect digital assets from theft, loss, or unauthorized access. For a company like Upexi , transitioning from e-commerce to managing significant crypto holdings, partnering with a trusted custodian like BitGo is a fundamental step to ensure asset safety and build confidence for stakeholders. Navigating Large Trades with OTC Trading Executing large buy or sell orders directly on public cryptocurrency exchanges can lead to significant price slippage and market disruption. This is why OTC trading desks are essential for institutional players. OTC trading allows parties to trade directly with each other, typically facilitated by a broker or a firm like BitGo , outside of the open exchange order books. For Upexi , which plans to potentially increase its Solana holdings further, using BitGo’s OTC trading services enables them to acquire or divest large amounts of SOL discreetly and at negotiated prices, minimizing the impact on the broader market price of Solana . This is a standard practice for large investors and a key service offered by institutional crypto platforms. Looking Ahead: Upexi’s Digital Asset Future With the BitGo partnership in place, Upexi is well-equipped to pursue its ambition of expanding its digital asset portfolio. The company has stated its intention to manage its existing holdings and potentially acquire more Solana . This strategic shift by a non-crypto native company highlights a broader trend of diversification and exploration of value within the digital asset landscape. The success of Upexi’s Solana -based strategy and its digital asset management through BitGo will be closely watched. It could serve as an interesting case study for other e-commerce or traditional businesses considering a similar move into the crypto market. The partnership underscores the growing demand for institutional-grade infrastructure to support this evolution. Conclusion: A Strategic Alignment for Growth The partnership between BitGo and Upexi represents a strategic alignment that provides Upexi with the secure foundation needed to execute its ambitious Solana -focused digital asset strategy. By leveraging BitGo ‘s expertise in crypto custody and OTC trading , Upexi is positioning itself to navigate the complexities of the cryptocurrency market confidently. This collaboration not only benefits both companies but also signals the continued maturation and institutional adoption of the digital asset ecosystem, particularly highlighting the increasing interest in platforms like Solana among corporate entities.

Bitcoin Investors With 10 to 10,000 BTC Have Expanded Holdings Recently In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has talked about the latest trend in the supply held by Bitcoin’s key investors: those holding between between 10 and 10,000 BTC. Related Reading: Bitcoin Near ATH, But Still No Extreme Greed: Green Sign For Bull Run? At the current exchange rate, this range converts to $1 million at the lower end and $1 billion at the upper end. Thus, the only investors who would be able to qualify for it would be the ones with substantial holdings. Generally, the influence of any entity in the market goes up the more supply that they control, so the holders belonging to this range would hold an important place in the ecosystem. Collectively, these investors are popularly known as the sharks and whales. Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm, which shows the trend in the Supply Distribution for the sharks and whales, an indicator that tracks the combined supply held by members of these cohorts: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin sharks and whales have seen their Supply Distribution go up recently, which suggests these large investors have been expanding their holdings. More specifically, the investors falling in the 10 to 10,000 BTC range have added around 83,100 tokens to their wallets over the past month. This accumulation hasn’t come in a constant manner, however, as these investors in fact reduced their supply for a period earlier in the month. This selling from the cohorts followed BTC’s recovery beyond $97,000, so it’s likely that the motive behind it was profit-taking. From the chart, it’s also visible that this selloff resulted in a pullback for the cryptocurrency. During the latest renewal of bullish momentum, the sharks and whales have again resumed their Bitcoin accumulation and have notably surpassed their holdings from the earlier peak. So far, the groups have shown no signs of profit-taking, which can naturally be a bullish sign for the rally’s sustainability. Related Reading: XRP Target Could Be $15 If This Pattern Is In Play, Analyst Says In the same chart, Santiment has also attached the data for the Supply Distribution of the investors carrying less than 0.1 BTC. Interestingly, these investors have been selling while the sharks and whales have gone through accumulation. This could be an indication that the shrimps believe the top could be in soon. Given the accumulation from the large investors, though, the analytics firm notes, “it may be a matter of time until Bitcoin’s coveted $110K all-time high level is breached, particularly after the U.S. & China tariff pause.” BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $103,800, up 11% in the last seven days.

Trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 785,900 followers on the social media platform X that he’s extremely bullish on the crypto market as mainstream institutional players begin to embrace the asset class. According to Van de Poppe, conditions in the crypto market are reminiscent of the Dot-com era, when tech and web-based firms saw their valuation skyrocket as investors piled in and became overexuberant on the emerging sector. “All I know: This is the cycle where everything is going to go ballistic. Higher than ever. The Dot-com bubble type of cycle for crypto, where there’s a lot of liquidity flowing into this asset class and a lot of adoption. It’s basically the only asset class to be significantly outperforming everything.” The Dot-com bubble exploded in 2000, destroying $5 trillion in wealth and driving thousands of companies into bankruptcy. One altcoin on the trader’s radar for a potential repeat of the Dot-com bubble is payments altcoin XRP . Van de Poppe predicts that the coin will come close to its all-time high (ATH) of $3.40. “When things go absolutely vertical, that’s the moment where you want to zoom out and get higher time frame entry points. The same applied for XRP. Marked the level around $1.75 as an important one for entries and it’s up 50% since. I assume we’ll attack the ATHs soon.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, XRP is worth $2.52. The trader is also bullish on the Solana ( SOL ) rival Sei ( SEI ). Van de Poppe predicts that SEI will rally by as much as 169% from current levels. “Indeed, break and flip and the next target is $0.30. I think that SEI will be trending up significantly more. First stop is $0.30, after that a slight correction for people to jump into the asset and then we’ll continue towards the $0.50-0.70 range. ” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, SEI is worth $0.26.

44588308,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=160054,1747180838,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Pioneering: Gibraltar Launches World’s First Crypto Derivatives Clearing Framework,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/gibraltar-crypto-clearing-framework/,"Get ready for a significant leap forward in the world of digital assets! Gibraltar, a jurisdiction known for its forward-thinking approach to crypto regulation, has just announced a groundbreaking initiative. They are set to introduce the world’s first regulatory framework specifically designed for the clearing and settlement of crypto derivatives. This isn’t just another piece of regulation; it’s a move poised to bring a new level of stability and trust to a rapidly evolving market, particularly concerning Gibraltar crypto derivatives trading. Understanding the Need for a Crypto Clearing Framework Before diving into the specifics of Gibraltar’s announcement, let’s talk about why clearing is so crucial, especially in the context of volatile markets like cryptocurrency. In traditional finance, clearing houses sit between buyers and sellers of derivatives contracts (like futures and options). Their primary role is to guarantee the transaction, even if one party defaults. This process, known as central clearing, significantly reduces ‘counterparty risk’ – the risk that the other side of your trade won’t fulfill their obligations. In the burgeoning crypto derivatives market, counterparty risk has been a persistent concern. While many platforms offer derivatives trading, the lack of a standardized, regulated clearing mechanism leaves participants exposed. If a large trading firm or even an exchange itself faces financial distress, it can have cascading effects, potentially leaving other market participants with unrealized losses. Gibraltar’s proposed crypto clearing framework aims to address this head-on. By establishing clear rules and requirements for entities acting as clearing houses for virtual asset derivatives, they are essentially building a safety net. This framework is being developed through a collaboration between the Government of Gibraltar, the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission (GFSC), and Bullish, a crypto exchange with a focus on institutional-grade infrastructure. This partnership brings together regulatory expertise and practical market experience. How Will the Virtual Asset Clearing Framework Work? The core idea behind Gibraltar’s initiative is to adapt well-established principles from traditional financial market clearing to the unique characteristics of virtual assets. While the full details of the framework are yet to be unveiled, we can anticipate key elements based on standard clearing house operations and the information available: Central Counterparty Role: Recognized clearing houses will act as central counterparties (CCPs), becoming the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer. This mutualizes and manages risk. Risk Management: The framework will likely mandate robust risk management procedures for clearing houses, including margin requirements, default management protocols, and stress testing. Segregation of Assets: Rules will likely require the segregation of customer assets from the clearing house’s own funds, providing an extra layer of protection in case of insolvency. Transparency: The framework is expected to enhance market transparency by providing a clearer picture of outstanding positions and risk exposures to regulators and market participants. Eligibility Criteria: There will be stringent requirements for entities seeking recognition as virtual asset clearing houses under the framework. According to reports, the framework specifically targets the clearing and settlement of virtual asset derivative contracts. This means contracts like futures, options, and perpetual swaps whose value is derived from underlying cryptocurrencies or other virtual assets. By focusing on this segment, Gibraltar is addressing one of the riskiest, yet increasingly popular, areas of the crypto market. Benefits of Regulated Digital Asset Clearing Introducing a regulated framework for clearing virtual asset derivatives offers a multitude of benefits for the market and participants: Reduced Counterparty Risk: This is the most significant benefit. By having a regulated clearing house guarantee trades, participants are protected from the default of their individual trading partner. Increased Market Integrity: Central clearing brings standardization and oversight, making the market more robust and less susceptible to manipulation or systemic failure. Enhanced Transparency: Clearing houses provide a central point for monitoring exposures, which can give regulators and market participants better insights into market health and potential risks. Greater Investor Protection: With clear rules and risk management procedures, investors and traders have greater confidence that their trades will be honored. Potential for Institutional Adoption: Traditional financial institutions are often hesitant to engage in unregulated markets due to compliance and risk constraints. A regulated clearing framework can significantly lower this barrier, potentially unlocking substantial institutional capital for Gibraltar crypto derivatives and the wider virtual asset market. Improved Liquidity: As confidence and participation grow, the market becomes more liquid, leading to tighter spreads and better execution prices for traders. Attracting Business to Gibraltar: By being the first to offer such a framework, Gibraltar positions itself as a leader in regulated crypto finance, potentially attracting businesses and talent to the jurisdiction. This move is a clear signal that Gibraltar is serious about fostering a mature, responsible, and sustainable digital asset ecosystem. It builds upon their existing Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) regulatory framework, which has been in place since 2018. Potential Challenges and Considerations While the prospect of regulated digital asset clearing is exciting, implementing such a framework is not without its challenges: Complexity of Virtual Assets: Crypto markets operate 24/7, are highly volatile, and involve various types of assets and networks. Adapting traditional clearing systems, designed for markets with defined trading hours and established assets, requires significant technical and operational innovation. Cross-Border Issues: Crypto markets are global. How will Gibraltar’s framework interact with regulations (or lack thereof) in other jurisdictions? This could create complexities for international firms. Attracting Clearing Houses: Will there be sufficient interest from entities willing and able to meet the stringent requirements to become recognized clearing houses for virtual assets? Technology Integration: Clearing houses will need sophisticated technology to manage the unique aspects of crypto derivatives, including potentially handling settlement in various cryptocurrencies or stablecoins. Regulatory Arbitrage: While Gibraltar leads, the absence of similar frameworks elsewhere could potentially push some activity to less regulated venues, at least in the short term. These are challenges that the GFSC and its partners will need to carefully navigate as they finalize and implement the framework. The collaboration with Bullish suggests a practical approach, leveraging market participant insights to build a workable system. Gibraltar’s Strategic Move in Crypto Derivatives Regulation Gibraltar has consistently aimed to be a reputable hub for digital finance. Its existing DLT framework was one of the first of its kind globally, providing a clear regulatory path for businesses using blockchain technology. Launching the first crypto derivatives regulation specifically for clearing is a logical next step and reinforces this ambition. By focusing on clearing, Gibraltar is targeting a critical piece of financial infrastructure. This is not just about allowing trading; it’s about making trading safer and more reliable. This focus on infrastructure-level regulation is arguably more impactful than simply licensing trading platforms. This framework could serve as a blueprint for other jurisdictions considering how to regulate the complex world of crypto derivatives. As institutional interest in crypto grows, the demand for regulated, secure trading and clearing solutions will only increase. Gibraltar is positioning itself to meet that demand. What This Means for the Market For traders and investors, this framework could mean access to more reliable and less risky ways to trade crypto derivatives. While the initial impact might be on larger, institutionally focused platforms operating under the framework, the increased market maturity and reduced systemic risk could benefit the entire ecosystem in the long run. For crypto businesses, particularly those involved in derivatives, Gibraltar offers a potentially attractive jurisdiction to operate within a clear, regulated environment. This could encourage more sophisticated products and services to be developed and offered under robust oversight. For other regulators, Gibraltar’s approach provides a real-world example of how traditional financial regulation principles can be adapted to the unique challenges of virtual assets. It highlights the importance of focusing on core financial infrastructure like clearing to build a safer market. The development of this framework is a significant step towards bridging the gap between traditional finance and the digital asset space. It acknowledges the growing importance of crypto derivatives while putting essential safeguards in place. Conclusion: A New Era for Crypto Derivatives? Gibraltar’s announcement of the world’s first regulatory framework for clearing and settlement of crypto derivatives is a landmark moment. It signals a maturation of the digital asset market and a proactive approach from regulators to build essential financial infrastructure. By focusing on reducing counterparty risk and enhancing market integrity through regulated clearing houses, Gibraltar is setting a precedent that could influence how other jurisdictions approach crypto derivatives regulation .

The current Mantra (OM) price analysis shows a coin stuck in a holding pattern, trying to break above key levels. Meanwhile, the Ethereum (ETH) price update has caught investor attention, with ETH jumping 7% thanks to the Pectra upgrade. Both tokens have setups worth watching, though each comes with its level of risk. Meanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) is gaining traction due to its Buyer Battles and the current price $0.0262 in batch 28. Traders climb the leaderboard to score massive daily rewards, including unclaimed coins. BlockDAG’s thoughtful design and growing community give it a solid reputation as the best crypto platform. OM Price Stuck Near Resistance With Mixed Signals The latest Mantra (OM) price analysis reveals a coin in limbo. Trading at $0.3636, Mantra recently saw its volume spike nearly 69% in one day before sliding back, suggesting traders are paying attention. According to recent Mantra price analysis, the coin bounced off support but continues to stall under the $0.42 resistance zone. If OM can break through that barrier, analysts say a run to $0.45 or even $0.48 could follow. But there are caution signs too. The OM price still struggles with a high fully diluted valuation compared to its total value locked. Profit-taking and macro headwinds might cap any near-term rally. Until OM clears that $0.42 line, the upside comes with hesitation. ETH Price Update: Pectra Upgrade Sparks Investor Confidence The newest Ethereum (ETH) price update comes as the Pectra upgrade lands, bringing serious improvements to how users interact with the network. ETH is now trading at $1,958, up nearly 7% in 24 hours. This bump follows the merger of Prague and Electra into a new upgrade suite called Pectra, which includes easier wallet features and gas payments in multiple tokens. One key change, the validator cap moving from 32 ETH to 2,048, caters to larger holders like ETF issuers. As this Ethereum (ETH) price update notes, investor interest is growing, with over 3.5 million ETH accumulated in under two months. Short-term targets now hover around $2,200 and $4,000. BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles Turn Trading Into a Race BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles are making crypto buying feel like a high-stakes contest. Every day, 25 million BDAG coins hit the presale market. Buyers rush in, and anything left behind? It goes straight to the biggest spender of the day, no paperwork, no fine print, just pure reward. That’s helped push total presale funds past $241 million, with more than 20.1 billion BDAG coins already sold. Those who joined early? They’re sitting on a 2,520% ROI. And with the current batch price $0.0262 to the launch price $0.05, today’s buyers can lock in over 90% ROI. This competitive format is creating real winners. If just 20% of that day’s allocation goes unclaimed, the top buyer could walk away with nearly $131K worth of BDAG at the batch price of $0.0262, or as much as $250K if the coin launches at $0.05. Veteran buyers are circling back to protect their spots, while new players are jumping in to grab BDAG on the cheap. Social media buzzes every night as wallets battle it out before the midnight UTC deadline. For anyone looking for the best crypto platform that combines utility and excitement, BlockDAG is making its case in real time. What Should Traders Watch Now? Traders are eyeing two key markers this week: OM trying to clear $0.42, and ETH aiming for $2,200. The Mantra (OM) price analysis remains cautiously optimistic, while the Ethereum (ETH) price update shows solid growth potential thanks to Pectra. But the real energy is flowing toward BlockDAG. With Buyer Battles driving daily action, the current batch 28th price $0.0262, and a chance to claim unclaimed coins, BDAG offers a different momentum. With early buyers already up 2,520%, those on the sidelines might want to act before May 13 closes the window.

Investors felt safe keeping most of their wealth in U.S.-based assets for years because of the country’s strong economy, stable currency, and deep financial markets. Still, recent trade disputes, new tariffs, and concerns about the long-term strength of the dollar are crushing their confidence. UBS clients reduce U.S.-dollar exposure as volatility rises The co-head of wealth management for Asia at USB, Amy Lo, said that the company’s wealthy clients are pulling away from U.S.-dollar investments as they feel uneasy about putting too much of their money in assets tied to the U.S. dollar amid global economic uncertainty and the ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China . Amy Lo also noted that most of their clients are turning to gold because it isn’t tied to any single government or currency, while others are putting their cash in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are becoming more widely accepted as alternative assets that balance traditional portfolios. Pro-crypto lawyer and strong advocate for XRP holders, John Deaton, even commented in a post on X saying, “We have officially reached the point where it is far more riskier to have zero exposure to Crypto than it is to allocate a small percentage of your net worth to it.” Clients are also looking for opportunities that offer growth without relying on the U.S. economy alone, which makes them more focused on managing risks and not just chasing high returns. UBS and other wealth management firms stated that these investors are adopting structured asset allocation models that spread risk more evenly. Morgan Stanley, for example, recommends a 40-40-15 split whereby 40% of your assets are in fixed-income bonds, another 40% in equities or stocks, and 15% in alternative investments like private equity or hedge funds, with the remaining 5% held in cash or cash-like assets in case of market downturns. Investors regain confidence in China and shift allocations Many wealthy investors who avoided the Chinese market for the past few years because of poor performance, strict regulations, and ongoing tensions with the United States are now slowly shifting their money back into Chinese assets due to strong stock performance, a more positive trade environment , and innovations from Chinese companies. Hong Kong’s stock market, the Hang Send Index (HSI) , is one of the best-performing stock indexes in the world in 2025, and Amy Lo explains that clients are now asking her directly about investment opportunities in the country after years of avoiding anything to do with China. This shift shows how quickly investor sentiment can change when signs of progress and stability appear. The recent tariff truce between the U.S. and China helped cool down some trade war tensions that affected global markets. The United States lowered its tariffs on most Chinese imports from 145% to 30% for 90 days, while China cut down its duties from 125% to 10% and agreed to remove some of their countermeasures set in 2018, which gave investors hope that trade will continue to improve and make China a more attractive opportunity. A private wealth management expert at Morgan Stanley believes that the recent trade agreement between China and the U.S. has created new growth opportunities in both countries and that repositioning investor interest back to China is simultaneous with a recovery in U.S. growth stocks. Morgan Stanley expects its high-net-worth clients will earn 7% to 8% in total annual returns over the next seven to ten years, but Christina warns that achieving these returns is now more difficult because of volatile markets. For this reason, clients are now rethinking how much risk they are taking, how their portfolios are balanced, and what role each type of investment plays in helping them meet their financial goals.

This milestone marks a decentralized network overtaking one of China's largest technology companies in market value. Concurrently, Ethereum's market cap has also exceeded that of Coca-Cola. The surge in Ethereum's valuation has been accompanied by substantial buying activity from Abraxas Capital, a London-based asset management firm. Over the past six days, Abraxas Capital has acquired nearly $500 million worth of Ethereum, purchasing over 211,000 ETH. The firm reportedly borrowed $240 million in USDT from the decentralized lending platform Aave and transferred it to Binance, suggesting continued accumulation of Ethereum assets. This buying spree coincides with Ethereum's price rally past $2,600. There is speculation about the identity and motives of Abraxas Capital, with some noting previous transactions linking it to Alameda Research before the latter's collapse.

For those tracking technological advancements, particularly in areas like Generative AI , the impact is becoming increasingly visible across various sectors. This trend is now significantly influencing how we consume literature, with Audible, Amazon’s prominent audiobook service, making a major move to leverage AI. What is Audible Doing with AI Narration? Audible recently announced a strategic initiative to partner with publishers to convert print and e-books into audiobooks using AI narration . This approach is designed to rapidly expand Audible’s content library. In a competitive market against platforms like Apple and Spotify, a larger, diverse catalog is a key differentiator. By utilizing artificial intelligence, Audible can streamline the production process, making it faster and potentially more cost-effective for publishers to turn written works into audio experiences. This expansion leverages sophisticated AI capabilities developed by Amazon. Publishers collaborating with Audible have access to a variety of AI-generated voices. Currently, over 100 different AI voices are available, supporting English, French, Spanish, and Italian languages, with options for various accents and dialects. Audible has indicated plans to increase the selection of voices and languages over time, enhancing the versatility of its Audible AI platform. How Does Amazon AI Power This? The core technology enabling this initiative comes from Amazon’s extensive AI research and development. Amazon AI provides the underlying infrastructure and models required for high-quality text-to-speech conversion. This isn’t Audible’s first foray into using synthetic voices. In 2023, Amazon launched an invite-only beta program featuring a ‘virtual voice’ tool aimed at self-published authors in the U.S. This tool allowed independent creators to transform their e-books into audiobooks using synthetic speech technology, significantly lowering the barrier to entry for audiobook production. The adoption of this ‘virtual voice’ technology by self-published authors highlights its practical benefits. A search on Audible reveals tens of thousands of titles explicitly labeled as narrated by ‘Virtual Voice’. This demonstrates that the technology is popular, especially among authors who might lack the financial resources or time typically required for traditional audiobook narration, which involves hiring professional voice actors and studio time. AI audiobooks produced this way offer a scalable solution for content creators. Are There Concerns About AI Audiobooks? Despite the clear advantages in speed and scale, the widespread introduction of AI-generated narrations has sparked considerable discussion and debate within the publishing industry and among listeners. Critics frequently voice concerns regarding the potential impact of these AI recordings on the overall quality and artistic integrity of audiobooks. Professional narrators, in particular, have raised questions about the nuances, emotional depth, and performance aspects that human narrators bring to a text, which AI might struggle to replicate convincingly. It’s worth noting that Audible has also explored partnerships with human narrators in the context of AI. Last year, Audible reportedly invited a group of audiobook narrators to participate in training AI models on their voices, suggesting an interest in developing more sophisticated or personalized AI narration capabilities, potentially blurring the lines between fully synthetic and AI-assisted narration. What About AI Translation? Looking ahead, Audible is also planning to introduce Generative AI capabilities for translation later in the year. A beta version of AI translation services is expected to roll out, offering both text-to-text and speech-to-speech translation. Initially, this will support translations from English into Spanish, French, Italian, and German. This feature could open up vast libraries of content to new language markets without the need for manual translation and re-narration. Recognizing the critical need for accuracy in translation, especially for published works, Audible plans to offer publishers the option to engage professional linguists to review and refine these AI-generated translations. This hybrid approach aims to combine the speed and efficiency of AI with human expertise to ensure quality and fidelity to the original text. How Does Audible Compare to Competitors? The move towards AI narration is not unique to Audible. Spotify, which has emerged as the second-largest provider of audiobooks after Audible, has also recently invested efforts into expanding its audiobook catalog using AI tools. In February, Spotify announced a partnership with ElevenLabs, a prominent AI audio technology provider. This indicates that the use of artificial intelligence for content creation, specifically in the audiobook space, is becoming a key area of competition among major platforms. The competition between Audible and Spotify, fueled by advancements in Amazon AI and other AI technologies, is likely to accelerate the production and availability of audiobooks globally. While the debate over AI narration quality continues, the accessibility and speed offered by this technology are undeniable drivers of market expansion. Conclusion: The Future of AI Audiobooks Audible’s aggressive expansion of its AI audiobooks library marks a significant moment in the evolution of digital content. By leveraging Generative AI and Amazon AI , Audible is not only aiming to boost its catalog size but also potentially reshape the economics and accessibility of audiobook production for publishers and authors alike. While concerns about quality and the role of human narrators persist, the efficiency and scale offered by AI narration are poised to make audiobooks more widely available than ever before. As the technology improves and translation capabilities are added, we can expect AI to play an even larger role in how stories are told and heard across the globe.

44588469,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=160056,1747182033,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,AI Export Rules: Trump Administration Abruptly Halts Biden Policy,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-halts-ai-rules/,"In a move that has significant implications for the technology sector, particularly concerning advanced AI development and the global supply chain for critical components, the Trump administration AI team has officially reversed a key policy introduced by the previous administration. After a period of speculation, the U.S. Department of Commerce formally rescinded the Biden Administration’s Artificial Intelligence Diffusion Rule. This rule, part of the broader Biden AI policy , was poised to introduce new export limitations on U.S.-made AI chips to various countries and strengthen existing controls, marking a pivotal shift in how the U.S. managed its technological exports. Understanding the Previous Biden AI Policy The Artificial Intelligence Diffusion Rule, championed under the Biden AI policy and scheduled to take effect soon after its announcement in January, represented a structured approach to controlling the proliferation of advanced AI technology. It was designed to limit the ability of certain nations to access cutting-edge AI chips , which are essential for training sophisticated AI models. The core of the rule involved a tiered system categorizing countries based on perceived risk levels regarding technology diffusion: Tier 1 Countries: Nations considered close allies, such as Japan and South Korea, would have faced minimal to no new restrictions on receiving U.S. AI chips . Tier 2 Countries: This group included countries like Mexico and Portugal. For the first time, these regions would have encountered specific limits on the export of certain AI technologies and components. Tier 3 Countries: Countries deemed adversaries or high-risk, including China and Russia, would have seen existing controls tightened significantly, making it even harder for them to acquire advanced U.S. AI chips . This tiered approach aimed to balance national security concerns with international cooperation, but it also generated debate about its potential impact on global technology markets and research collaborations. Why the Trump Administration AI Team Reversed Course On Tuesday, the US Commerce Department , now operating under the directive of the Trump administration, announced that it had instructed its staff not to implement or enforce the Biden-era regulation. This decision effectively puts the brakes on the structured tiered system just days before its planned implementation. U.S. Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Security Jeffery Kessler provided insight into the rationale behind this abrupt change. He stated that the Trump administration AI strategy would pursue a different path, focusing on a “bold, inclusive strategy to American AI technology with trusted foreign countries around the world.” This contrasts with the blanket restrictions proposed under the previous Biden AI policy . Kessler explicitly rejected the Biden administration’s approach, labeling it “ill-conceived and counterproductive AI policies.” The administration appears to favor direct, country-by-country negotiations and targeted agreements rather than broad, predefined restrictions. This suggests a potential shift towards a more flexible, perhaps more politically driven, approach to managing technology exports and international AI collaboration. What’s Next for AI Chips and Export Controls? With the rescission of the Biden-era rule, the immediate future of U.S. AI export rules is somewhat uncertain, though the US Commerce Department has indicated its intentions. While the specific regulation is gone, the underlying concerns about technology transfer remain. The DOC plans to develop and issue a replacement rule in the future. In the interim, the US Commerce Department released guidance to the industry, emphasizing existing regulations and potential risks. Key points highlighted include: A reminder that using Huawei’s Ascend AI chips anywhere globally constitutes a violation of current U.S. export regulations. A warning about the significant potential consequences for U.S. companies if their AI chips are discovered being used to train AI models in China, underscoring the ongoing sensitivity around advanced AI development in that region. Recommendations for companies to enhance measures protecting their chip supply chains from diversion tactics, ensuring technology does not end up in unauthorized hands or locations. This guidance suggests that while the *method* of control is changing, the *goal* of preventing adversaries from accessing advanced U.S. AI chips remains a priority for the Trump administration AI strategy. The Implications of Changing AI Export Rules The sudden change in AI export rules has several potential implications: Industry Uncertainty: Companies involved in semiconductor manufacturing, AI hardware, and related software face uncertainty as they await the new framework. Planning global sales and partnerships becomes more complex without clear, long-term regulations. Geopolitical Dynamics: The shift from a tiered system to direct negotiations could alter diplomatic relations and technology partnerships. It might offer more flexibility but could also lead to inconsistent policies across different countries. Pace of Innovation: Some argue that blanket restrictions can slow down global AI development. A move towards more targeted controls, if implemented effectively, might potentially facilitate certain international collaborations, though national security remains a tight constraint. Competitive Landscape: The policy changes could impact the competitive positioning of U.S. companies versus international rivals in the AI chips market. The stated aim of the Trump administration AI approach is to be “inclusive” with trusted partners while keeping technology from adversaries. The success of this approach will depend heavily on the specifics of the forthcoming replacement rule and the effectiveness of direct negotiations. Conclusion: A New Era for AI Technology Policy The formal rescission of the Biden Administration’s Artificial Intelligence Diffusion Rule by the US Commerce Department marks a significant pivot in U.S. technology export policy. The structured, tiered approach of the Biden AI policy is being replaced by what the Trump administration AI team suggests will be a more flexible strategy centered on direct engagement and targeted controls. While the industry awaits the details of the new framework, the immediate guidance from the DOC underscores the continued focus on preventing sensitive AI chips and technology from reaching potential adversaries. This policy shift highlights the ongoing tension between fostering international technological advancement and safeguarding national security interests in the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence, particularly concerning critical components like AI chips .

Tether snapped up 4,812.2 Bitcoin ( BTC ) at $95,319 each and transferred it to an escrow wallet on May 9, Cantor Equity Partners disclosed in a May 13 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. It brings Twenty One’s total Bitcoin holdings to 36,312 BTC, as Cantor Equity Partners holds 31,500 BTC on behalf of the firm, which will trade under the ticker XXI once the SPAC merger is complete. Twenty One’s CEO, Jack Mallers, said on May 13 that they’re already in the approval process of the merger, but didn’t give an exact estimate on when the transaction would be complete. Twenty One is already the third largest corporate Bitcoin holder, trailing only Strategy and Bitcoin mining firm MARA Holdings at 568,840 Bitcoin and 48,237 Bitcoin, respectively, BitcoinTreasuries.net data shows. Tether is a majority stakeholder in Twenty One alongside crypto exchange Bitfinex. The Wall Street heavyweight Cantor Fitzgerald is sponsoring the merger, providing financial advisory services and securing $585 million in funding to support Twenty One’s Bitcoin investments. Japanese investment holding firm SoftBank also invested $900 million into Twenty One, which is led by Strike CEO Jack Mallers. Strategy may have a legitimate competitor Twenty One said in an April presentation to the SEC that is looking to supplant Michael Saylor’s Strategy , formerly MicroStrategy, to become the “superior vehicle” for investors seeking “capital-efficient Bitcoin exposure.” The company is among many Bitcoin buying firms , but promises to be a “pure play” for investors seeking Bitcoin exposure with Bitcoin-native operations and more flexibility for strategic capital raises.

Earlier filings showed that 23,950 Bitcoin is expected to come from Tether, 10,500 Bitcoin from Softbank and about 7,000 Bitcoin from Bitfinex, which will be converted into equity at $10 per share. Cantor Equity Partners’ (CEP) share price soared from $10.65 to $59.73 on May 2 but has since fallen back to $29.84, Google Finance data shows.

While the technology, which uses the quantum states of subatomic particles to perform calculations instead of transistors and binary code, is still in its infancy, companies including Google and Microsoft are pressing forward with research and development. The goal is a massive step-up in speed that makes tough calculations like cracking encryption, such as that used to protect blockchains, faster and simpler. And when quantum computing becomes available, any attacker is unlikely to announce their presence immediately. “The threat won’t start with Satoshi’s keys getting stolen,"" Dillion said in an interview. “The real quantum attack will look subtle, quiet, and gradual, like whales casually moving funds. By the time everyone realizes what’s happening, it’ll be too late."" Dillion's doomsday scenario involves a quantum-computing-powered double-spend attack. In theory, quantum computing could reduce the mining power required for a traditional 51% attack down to about 26%, Dillion said. ""So now you've compromised the 10,000 largest wallets. You rewind the chain, liquidate those 10,000 largest wallets, then double spend all the transactions, and now you've really got a nuclear bomb,” is how he imagines it. The industry, of course, is working to find a solution. Bitcoin developer Agustin Cruz, for instance, proposed QRAMP , a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) that mandates a hard-fork migration to quantum-secure addresses. Quantum startup BTQ has proposed replacing the proof-of-work consensus system that underpins the original blockchain entirely with quantum-native consensus. The problem is that the proposals must gain community approval. Blockchain governance, such as Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) and their Ethereum equivalents, Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), tends to be rife with politics, making it a long, inherently cautious process. For example, the Bitcoin community's recent resolution on the OP_RETURN function was years in the making, with months of developer debates about what's considered the ""proper"" use of the blockchain. Ethereum's upgrades, like the Merge, also faced lengthy debates and delays . Dillion argues that the governance process leaves crypto dangerously exposed because quantum computing threats will evolve much faster than the protocols can respond. “Everyone's trying to do this from the top down by starting with a BIP or an EIP and getting everyone's buy-in together. But we think that this is a very difficult, heavy lift,” he said. Quip Network’s quantum-proof vaults aim to circumvent the political inertia by allowing immediate user-level adoption without requiring protocol upgrades. The vaults leverage hybrid cryptography, blending classical cryptographic standards with quantum-resistant techniques to provide blockchain-agnostic security. Effectively, they allow the whales, holders of large amounts of a cryptocurrency, to secure their stashes while waiting for the machinations of blockchain governance to get it together. Crypto communities can't afford leisurely debates, he argues. “The BIP and EIP processes are great for governance, but terrible for rapid threat response,” said Dillion. ""When quantum hits, attackers won’t wait for community consensus.” Colton Dillon is speaking at the IEEE Canada Blockchain Forum, part of Consensus 2025 in Toronto. The IEEE is a Knowledge Partner of Consensus.

The latest wave of innovation is hitting how we consume media, and one exciting development comes from the realm of music streaming. Spotify is rolling out a significant update to its Spotify AI DJ feature, introducing interactive voice commands. This isn’t just about listening; it’s about telling your AI what you want to hear, marking a leap forward in personalized audio experiences. How Spotify AI DJ Voice Commands Work The Spotify AI DJ , first launched in early 2023, initially served as a curated stream with commentary. Now, it’s evolving into a truly interactive assistant. The core functionality revolves around using your voice to influence the music being played. Here’s a breakdown: Initiating the DJ: You can find the AI DJ by typing “DJ” in the Spotify search bar. Making Voice Requests: Once the DJ is active, you can hold down the dedicated DJ button (typically located on the bottom right) to speak your commands. What You Can Request: Users can ask the AI DJ to play specific songs, request tracks from particular artists, change the current genre, or even alter the overall mood of the playlist it’s generating. Quick Mood Change: If you don’t have a specific voice request but want to quickly shift the vibe, a quick press of the DJ button can prompt the AI to transition to a different style or mood. This feature is currently rolling out in over 60 markets, initially supporting English voice commands. This expansion makes the interactive AI DJ accessible to a much wider global audience, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with streaming technology . The Benefits of Enhanced Music Personalization Why is adding voice commands to the Spotify AI DJ such a big deal? It significantly enhances the user experience through deeper music personalization . Here are some key benefits: Effortless Control: Change the music without needing to navigate menus or type searches. Ideal for when you’re driving, cooking, or otherwise occupied. Dynamic Discovery: Instead of passively listening, you can actively guide the AI to explore different genres, artists, or moods on the fly, leading to more tailored music discovery. More Engaging Experience: The ability to talk to your AI DJ makes the interaction feel more like having a personal curator who responds to your immediate preferences. Instant Adaptation: Your mood can change rapidly. Voice commands allow the AI DJ to adapt almost instantly, ensuring the music always fits the moment. This level of control moves beyond traditional algorithmic playlists, offering a more fluid and responsive way to interact with Spotify’s vast library and the potential of AI music curation. The Technology Powering AI Music Interaction While the user experience is simple, the technology behind the Spotify AI DJ and its new voice capabilities is complex. It involves a combination of advanced AI models: Speech Recognition: Converting spoken voice commands into text or actionable instructions. Natural Language Processing (NLP): Understanding the intent and context of user requests, even if phrased casually or ambiguously. Recommendation Engines: Leveraging Spotify’s extensive data on user listening habits, musical attributes, and trends to select appropriate songs based on the voice commands. Generative AI (for commentary): While not directly tied to voice commands, the original DJ feature used generative AI to create the spoken commentary between songs, adding to the personalized feel. Integrating these components allows the AI DJ to not just understand what you say but also make intelligent decisions about the music it plays next, creating a seamless blend of user input and algorithmic curation. This sophisticated use of AI music technology is a testament to the potential of AI in enhancing digital services. Comparing Spotify’s AI DJ to Other AI Features Spotify isn’t new to leveraging AI. Besides the Spotify AI DJ , the company also introduced a feature allowing users to create playlists using text prompts. How does the interactive AI DJ with voice commands stack up? Text Prompt Playlists: This feature is great for creating a playlist based on a specific theme, activity, or mood described in text. It’s useful for building a static collection. Interactive AI DJ: The AI DJ is designed for dynamic, real-time listening. Voice commands allow for instant adjustments and continuous discovery within a live stream, rather than building a fixed list. Complementary Tools: These features serve different purposes. The text prompt tool is for curation and collection building, while the AI DJ with voice is for live, adaptive playback and exploration. Both features demonstrate Spotify’s commitment to using AI to improve music personalization , offering users different ways to interact with and discover music based on their needs and preferences at any given moment. They represent different facets of how streaming technology is evolving. Future Outlook and Potential Challenges The introduction of voice commands for the Spotify AI DJ opens up exciting possibilities for the future of music streaming. Imagine a truly conversational AI DJ that can discuss music, provide trivia, or even help you discover artists based on subtle nuances in your requests. However, there are potential challenges: Accuracy of Voice Recognition: Ensuring the AI accurately understands commands across different accents, languages, and background noise is crucial for user satisfaction. Natural Language Understanding: The AI needs to handle complex or ambiguous requests gracefully. Scalability: Rolling out sophisticated AI features like this globally, especially with multilingual support, requires significant infrastructure and ongoing development. User Adoption: Will users readily adopt talking to their music app? The feature needs to provide clear value and ease of use. Despite these challenges, the trajectory suggests a future where our interactions with streaming technology become increasingly intuitive and personalized, with AI music curators playing a central role. Actionable Insights for Users Ready to try out the new interactive Spotify AI DJ ? Here’s how you can make the most of the new voice commands : Experiment with Requests: Don’t just ask for specific songs. Try asking the DJ to “play something upbeat,” “switch to jazz,” or “play more songs like this one.” Refine Your Language: Pay attention to how the AI responds to different phrasing and adjust your commands for better results. Use the Quick Press: When you’re unsure what you want but need a change, a quick press of the DJ button is an easy way to refresh the music. Provide Feedback: While not a direct voice command feature, using Spotify’s feedback mechanisms can help improve the AI over time. Embracing these interactive features allows you to take greater control of your listening experience and unlock deeper levels of music personalization provided by this evolving AI music feature. Conclusion: A New Era of Music Interaction Spotify’s integration of voice commands into its Spotify AI DJ is a significant step forward in the evolution of music streaming. It transforms a passive listening experience into an interactive one, offering users unprecedented control over their real-time music personalization . This move highlights the growing impact of AI on how we interact with digital content and services.

Enter Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a low-priced token rapidly gaining attention from those who saw DOGE transform $5,000 into $300,000 in just six months. With its innovative approach to decentralized finance and the backing of a passionate community, MUTM is emerging as the next big opportunity. The project is already at Phase 4 of its presale and has already raised more than $8 million and more than 9,700 investors. With over 70% sold out during this stage, the price will go up by 20% to $0.03 in Phase 5 and with an expected launch price of $0.06. As crypto enthusiasts and Dogecoin investors look for the next big breakout, MUTM is shaping up to be a serious coin, potentially delivering gains that could rival DOGE’s past meteoric rise. Mutuum Finance: A New Era in DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance is not another DeFi wave-rider project it provides a twin lending mechanism incorporating Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) capabilities. The hybrid system offers stability as well as control to users. P2C Lending enables investors to receive yield by providing stablecoins such as USDT to lending pools that are governed by smart contracts, providing a safe and automated means of earning passive income. In contrast, P2P Lending allows direct borrowing and lending relations between users with no middlemen. This aspect enhances privacy and allows for more personalized lending, giving users more control over the transaction. Through this novel setup Mutuum Finance is now a viable and scalable product within the DeFi ecosystem. It is also currently undergoing a third-party audit by Certik to further enhance transparency and investor trust. Presale Growth and Launch Price Expectations Currently, at $0.025, the MUTM token is highly sought after. Those who invest now at this stage in Phase 4 are set to appreciate by 20% once Phase 5 begins. The market launch price is at $0.06, but some crypto analysts are already predicting it is going to be up within no time after its release, an exponential rise compared to today’s prices in the presale. These are the explanations why MUTM is one of the most debated low-price DeFi coins. Fueling Growth Through Community and Rewards The platform is also developing a thriving community with reward-based mechanics. There is an active leaderboard that shows the top 50 token holders and rewarding them with additional MUTM tokens. In addition, there is a token giveaway with a $100,000 prize ongoing, in which ten winners will receive $10,000 each in MUTM. A referral program also incentivizes user growth by rewarding participants who refer new users to the platform. Why Investors Are Taking Notice Mutuum Finance is becoming one of the most sensational early-stage decentralized finance opportunities. As the token draws near its next price milestone and launch, early investors would be much better off enjoying token appreciation along with platform rewards. Just as Dogecoin turned early believers into crypto legends, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now drawing in a new wave of investors chasing outsized gains, with some eyeing the potential to flip $5K into $300K within months. Already raising $8M+ from over 9,700 backers, and with Phase 4 over 70% sold out, MUTM is proving it’s not just hype, it’s momentum backed by innovation. With the next phase bringing a 20% price increase, and a launch target of $0.06, today’s entry point at $0.025 could be the last chance for investors to get in at the ground floor. Don’t wait until MUTM is trending, move now or risk missing the next DOGE-sized breakout.

Currently priced at $2.52 , XRP has dropped 3.05% in the last 24 hours , with a $147.33 billion market cap . While Ripple’s regulatory clarity has boosted investor confidence, its massive market cap limits its growth potential. Enter Ruvi . This presale crypto is going to outperform Ripple and deliver crazy returns. It’s early stage innovation + bonus packed presale = can’t miss opportunity for forward thinking investors. Ripple’s Past Success vs Ruvi’s Future Ripple’s blockchain has revolutionized cross border payments with its speed and scalability. Recent SEC clarity has solidified its position as a regulated crypto, attracting institutional interest. But here’s the thing: Ripple’s massive market cap means there’s limited room for the exponential gains we saw in its early days. Ruvi is in its early stage . By getting in on Ruvi’s presale you’re basically buying into the beginning of what could be the next XRP like success story. With its AI driven features and blockchain efficiencies Ruvi is going to disrupt the industry in ways Ripple can no longer. Where Ruvi Stands Out: Presale Bonuses A key difference? Ruvi’s presale bonus structure designed to reward early adopters big time. By getting in now you’ll increase your holdings before it hits the public market.

44589606,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=160069,1747184406,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Thailand Digital Bond: Unlocking $150M G-Token Opportunity,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/thailand-digital-bond-g-token/,"Are you interested in how traditional finance is converging with the world of digital assets? A significant development is unfolding in Southeast Asia, as Thailand takes a bold step into the realm of tokenized government bond issuances. The news centers around the planned issuance of a substantial Thailand digital bond , specifically a digital investment token dubbed the G-Token, by the nation’s Finance Ministry. What is the Planned G-Token Thailand Issuance? According to reports from Bloomberg, Thailand’s Finance Ministry is preparing to issue 5 billion baht, which translates to approximately $150 million USD, through a digital investment token known as the G-Token. This initiative was highlighted by Thailand’s Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister, Pichai Chunhavajira. He indicated that the G-Token issuance is expected to occur within the next two months, forming a part of the government’s broader budget borrowing strategy. The core idea behind this G-Token issuance is to leverage digital technology to streamline and potentially enhance the traditional bond market. While specific technical details about the underlying platform (likely a form of distributed ledger technology or blockchain) are still emerging, the focus is clearly on creating a digital representation of a sovereign debt instrument. Why Issue a Tokenized Government Bond? Exploring the Benefits The move towards a tokenized government bond offers several potential advantages, both for the issuer (the Thai government) and for investors. The Finance Minister pointed to a couple of key benefits directly: Accessibility for Small Investors: One significant aspect mentioned is that investors will be able to participate in the G-Token bond issuance with relatively small amounts of cash. Traditional government bonds often require high minimum investment thresholds, limiting access for individual retail investors. Tokenization, by allowing for fractional ownership, can democratize access to these financial instruments. Boosting Secondary Market Trading: The digital token format is anticipated to potentially boost secondary market bond trading. Tokenization can facilitate faster settlement times and potentially increase liquidity compared to traditional bond markets, which can sometimes be less efficient, especially for smaller trades. Beyond these specific points, the general benefits often associated with tokenizing assets, including bonds, can include: Increased Transparency: Transactions recorded on a distributed ledger can offer greater transparency (depending on the specific setup). Improved Efficiency: Automated processes via smart contracts can reduce manual effort and costs. 24/7 Trading Potential: Digital markets can theoretically operate around the clock, unlike traditional markets with set hours. Sovereign Digital Bond: Part of a Global Trend? Thailand’s plan to issue a sovereign digital bond is not happening in a vacuum. Governments and international financial institutions globally have been exploring or implementing similar initiatives. Examples include the European Investment Bank (EIB) which has issued digital bonds on a blockchain platform, and the World Bank which has also experimented with bond tokenization. These moves signal a growing interest among sovereign and quasi-sovereign entities in exploring how digital ledger technology can be applied to traditional capital markets. While each implementation varies in design and purpose, the overarching theme is the exploration of technology to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and potentially broaden investor bases for government debt. Implications for Thailand Blockchain Finance This G-Token issuance represents a significant step for the landscape of Thailand blockchain finance . It signals the government’s willingness to embrace digital asset technology beyond just cryptocurrencies, applying it to core financial infrastructure like debt markets. This could have several ripple effects: Validation: A government-backed digital asset issuance lends credibility to the broader blockchain and digital asset ecosystem within Thailand. Infrastructure Development: It may necessitate or accelerate the development of necessary digital infrastructure, regulatory frameworks, and technical expertise within the country. Innovation Catalyst: It could encourage further innovation and adoption of blockchain technology by private sector financial institutions in Thailand. This move aligns with Thailand’s broader digital transformation goals and its efforts to position itself as a technologically advanced nation in the region. Potential Challenges and Considerations While the benefits are promising, the path to successful implementation of a Thailand digital bond is not without potential challenges. These could include: Regulatory Clarity: Ensuring the appropriate legal and regulatory framework is in place for digital bonds. Investor Education: Educating both institutional and retail investors about this new format of investment. Technology Risk: Ensuring the underlying technology is secure, reliable, and scalable. Market Adoption and Liquidity: Building sufficient interest and infrastructure to ensure a liquid secondary market develops as hoped. Careful planning and execution will be crucial to navigate these potential hurdles. A Compelling Step Forward Thailand’s plan to issue a $150 million G-Token digital bond is a noteworthy development in the convergence of traditional finance and digital assets. By potentially lowering the barrier to entry for investors and aiming to enhance secondary market trading, this initiative could serve as a significant case study for how governments can leverage tokenization for sovereign debt. It underscores the growing relevance of blockchain and digital asset technology in mainstream financial markets and marks a positive stride for Thailand blockchain finance on the global stage.

TRON has set a new record for stablecoin supply at $71.9 billion in USDT, yet TRX struggles to break past $0.25. Solana, priced near $146, is holding steady while bulls and bears battle for control. Amid these uncertain moves, Unstaked has exploded onto the scene, raising over $1 million in just 24 hours and reaching more than $5 million in total presale funds. Currently in stage 10 at $0.008234, Unstaked offers a rare presale opportunity. With no insider allocations, every buyer gets the same chance at success in this viral project. TRON Battles $0.25 as Strong Fundamentals Fail to Lift Price TRON (TRX) has made big gains in the stablecoin sector with $71.9 billion in USDT, fueled by six billion-dollar USDT mints by Tether since April. The network has grown fast, with monthly DEX volume rising 40% from $3.4 billion in March to $4.9 billion in April. TRON now hosts over 302 million accounts and more than 10 billion transactions. Even with this strength, TRX trades at around $0.243 and struggles to break the $0.25 wall. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 48.7 reflects market uncertainty. If TRX loses the $0.240 support, analysts say $0.235 could be the next stop. TRON’s $5 billion total value locked and growing institutional interest show promise. However, the price remains stuck in a tight range and only a breakout above $0.25 can fuel a real rally. Solana Holds Steady as Bulls Watch for Breakout Solana continues to show solid network growth despite recent price stalling. Trading at around $146, Solana’s stablecoin supply has hit $13 billion, and its TVL has grown to $7.65 billion. It leads daily DEX activity with over 57.77 million daily transactions. The price moves in a range between $130 and $150, with key resistance at $156. Analysts see a possible rally to $220 if SOL breaks out of this bull flag pattern. Lower trading volumes show hesitation, leaving SOL hovering in a tight channel. Large investors like DeFi Development Corp and SOL Strategies are still accumulating, showing long-term belief in Solana. For now, short-term price action remains stuck as buyers and sellers wait for the next big move. Unstaked’s $0.00848 Presale Sparks Investor Excitement As TRON and Solana navigate through their market struggles, Unstaked has quickly gained attention from investors. In just one day, Unstaked raised over $1 million, taking its total presale to $5 million. The project has stood out by refusing insider or developer allocations. Instead, all tokens are sold directly to public participants, ensuring fairness and security for buyers. Currently in stage 10, Unstaked is priced at $0.008234, offering early supporters a rare chance to enter a project with strong potential. The launch price is set at $0.1819, which gives early buyers a significant upside. All activity is fully verifiable on-chain, reflecting the project’s commitment to transparency and safety. Unstaked AI introduces a platform where anyone can design, customise, and deploy their smart agents. These digital assistants are built to automate tasks, connect with audiences, and boost productivity. From social media handling to customer service and marketing automation, users can assign agents to meet their needs. The system is backed by blockchain, which guarantees that each agent is secure and owned by the user. Unlike traditional AI services run by large companies, Unstaked users have full control over their agents. The $UNSD token powers this platform and allows owners to enhance their agents’ features. Whether you are a creator wanting to grow your presence, a business aiming for efficiency, or a marketer seeking smarter automation, Unstaked delivers a flexible AI solution. This is not just another AI tool. It is your personal AI network built for you. Key Takeaway TRON’s network has expanded, with its stablecoin supply and user activity reaching records. Still, TRX struggles to hold above $0.25. Solana trades near $146, showing strong DeFi growth and attracting big investors, yet remains trapped in a limited price range. Meanwhile, Unstaked has caught early attention by raising over $1 million in just one day, with no insider allocations. The project’s focus on fairness and transparency has attracted buyers. At a crypto presale price of $0.008234 in stage 10, Unstaked gives a rare opening to those seeking high potential returns without the usual risks of speculative tokens.

The analyst still expects XRP to rally to four digits and has in the past explained why he believes such an ambitious price target is possible. XRP Price To Still Rally To $1,000 In an X post, BarriC stated that a potential XRP price rally to between $10 and $20 is just the beginning. He added that the long game for the altcoin is $1,000. The analyst urged market participants to be prepared for life-changing and generational wealth. In his other X posts, BarriC provided a roadmap for how it can reach four digits. Related Reading: Analyst Says These Factors Will Drive XRP Price To $1,000, But What Does Market Cap Say? In one post, he stated that once the XRP price reclaims $3, it will move rapidly to $5. The analyst predicts that the altcoin will then skyrocket into double digits, sitting comfortably at between $10 and $20 as a new all-time high. However, BarriC believes that is just the start for XRP as it will still reach $100 and then $1,000. He asserted that these price targets for XRP will happen much sooner than people think. In another post, the analyst alluded to banks using XRP as one factor that could spark this XRP price surge. BarriC stated that the fact that investors can still accumulate the altcoin at around $2 means that banks aren’t utilizing it yet. The analyst said that once banks and financial institutions worldwide adopt and utilize XRP in the way they conduct finance, the altcoin will skyrocket to $1,000. He referenced the 2017 bull cycle when the token’s price went from $0.006 to $3.80, which is why he is confident that such a parabolic surge is possible. The Altcoin Approaching Key Resistance Levels In an X post, crypto analyst CasiTrades stated that the XRP price is approaching key resistance levels following its latest surge. She highlighted $2.69 as the major resistance, as this price level is also the .236 Fib retracement from the all-time high (ATH) and a key level to watch for a correction. Related Reading: XRP Price To $1,000: Analyst Reveals Target For When Banks Start Using XRP Commenting on the current price action, she noted that what stands out is the continued price increase despite low momentum and a completed 5-wave count. The analyst remarked that this slow, controlled push higher often signals strong underlying demand, strong trend, and heavy accumulation. CasiTrades stated that if the XRP price breaks and holds above $2.69, it would open the door for an explosive move toward $3. However, if the altcoin doesn’t hold this level, she claimed it could record a short-term dip toward $2.30 for a reset. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.50, up almost 5% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

But even Ethereum’s remarkable growth leaves room for other projects to offer exponential returns. Enter Ruvi, the blockchain and AI-powered token that’s disrupting the crypto scene with an upcoming presale boasting unparalleled potential for early investors. Could Ruvi become the next big thing in crypto, offering returns that outperform Ethereum? Here’s everything you need to know. Ethereum’s dominance faces new competition Ethereum’s strengths lie in its vast ecosystem, innovative upgrades like Pectra, and its move to a greener proof-of-stake model. It’s the backbone of decentralized applications (dApps), with a legacy that commands respect. However, with ETH’s price hovering around $2,486.66, the multiplication factor for investors is diminishing. On the other hand, Ruvi combines the power of artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain to solve pressing global issues, from streamlining logistics to refining data analytics, setting itself apart as more than just an alternative to existing cryptocurrencies. And with presale tokens priced at only $0.01, Ruvi is a ground-floor opportunity that promises massive upside. What makes Ruvi stand out? The Ruvi presale is designed for early adopters looking to maximize their gains, with bonus structures that increase returns exponentially based on investment size. Ethereum may have revolutionized the crypto world, but Ruvi’s aggressive approach to incentivize early adoption sets a new standard for ROI potential. Investment scenarios with Ruvi Here’s how Ruvi’s token presale turns modest investments into life-changing wealth. Using conservative future projections between $1 and $3 per token, here are three examples to demonstrate Ruvi’s potential. Entry-level investment ($800) With an $800 investment, you’ll receive 80,000 Ruvi tokens during the presale. Thanks to the 40% bonus, you’ll gain an extra 32,000 tokens, bringing your total to 112,000 tokens. Future Value at $1: $112,000 Future Value at $3: $336,000 Mid-level investment ($1,500) A $1,500 investment nets you 150,000 Ruvi tokens. At this level, the presale adds a 60% bonus, translating into an additional 90,000 tokens, for a grand total of 240,000 tokens. Future Value at $1: $240,000 Future Value at $3: $720,000 High-level investment ($7,000) For more ambitious investors, a $7,000 commitment secures 700,000 Ruvi tokens, doubled by a 100% bonus to reach 1.4 million tokens in total. Future Value at $1: $1,400,000 Future Value at $3: $4,200,000 These figures highlight why Ruvi has been dubbed the most exciting presale in crypto today. Compared to Ethereum’s slower price growth, Ruvi offers an unparalleled potential for both entry-level and high-level investors. Ruvi vs Ethereum: where should you invest? Ethereum may be the backbone of dApps and DeFi, but it’s not immune to competition. Its current price at $2,486.66 makes it less accessible for small-scale investors looking to maximize growth. Meanwhile, Ruvi offers a low-cost entry point with a groundbreaking mix of blockchain and AI utility, ensuring it isn’t just another speculative asset. Where Ethereum focuses on sophisticated infrastructure and institutional adoption, Ruvi provides direct solutions and unparalleled ROI for early adopters. If Ethereum’s evolution has taught us anything, it’s that early movers always win big. And with Ruvi positioned to make waves across multiple industries, now could be the perfect time to ride this rising star. Don’t miss out on Ruvi’s presale The cryptocurrency market rewards those who act fast. Just as Ethereum’s earliest investors saw their modest contributions grow astronomically, Ruvi offers a similar opportunity—but only for those who enter while prices are still low. With tokens at just $0.01 and massive bonuses on the table, Ruvi’s presale is your chance to secure life-changing gains before the price soars. Don’t be the one who looks back in regret; become the investor who seized the opportunity to shape the future of crypto.

44589853,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=160070,1747185003,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Google Gemini Transforms Android Auto Driving Experience,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/google-gemini-android-auto/,"In the rapidly evolving world of technology, where advancements in artificial intelligence are capturing global attention, Google is making a significant move by integrating its cutting-edge Google Gemini generative AI model into vehicles. For many in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, keeping an eye on major tech shifts like this is crucial, as AI infrastructure often intersects with distributed computing and decentralized networks. This integration promises to redefine the in-car experience, making driving more intuitive and connected than ever before. What is Google Gemini Bringing to Android Auto AI? Google recently announced its plans to bring Google Gemini to cars supporting Android Auto within the next few months. This move, revealed ahead of the company’s 2025 I/O developer conference, signifies a major transformation in how drivers interact with their vehicles’ infotainment systems. According to Google, adding Gemini functionality to Android Auto, and later to cars running Google’s built-in operating system, will make driving “more productive and fun.” Patrick Brady, VP of Android for Cars, described this as one of the most significant changes to the in-vehicle experience in a long time. The integration of Android Auto AI powered by Gemini will manifest in two primary ways: Enhanced Voice Assistant: Gemini will serve as a much more capable voice assistant. Users (drivers or passengers) can issue commands for tasks like sending texts, playing music, or getting directions, similar to the existing Google Assistant. However, Gemini’s natural language processing capabilities mean users won’t need rigid, specific commands. They can speak more conversationally. Contextual Understanding: Gemini can retain context and remember user preferences. For instance, it could remember a contact prefers texts in a certain language and handle the translation automatically. Advanced Information Retrieval: A common in-car tech request is finding points of interest along a route. Gemini will excel here, capable of mining Google listings and reviews to answer specific queries, such as finding “taco places with vegan options” nearby. Exploring the Potential of In-car AI with Gemini Live Beyond standard voice commands, Google Gemini will introduce “Gemini Live.” This feature allows the AI to be essentially always listening and ready to engage in more open-ended conversations. This aspect of In-car AI pushes the boundaries of what’s possible: Open Conversations: Users can discuss a wide range of topics, from brainstorming travel ideas for a trip to getting recipe suggestions or even discussing historical facts. Interactive Experience: This moves beyond simple command-response to a more interactive and engaging digital companion within the vehicle. While the idea of an always-listening AI might raise questions about distraction, Google claims Gemini’s natural language abilities will actually reduce cognitive load by making interactions smoother and requiring less mental effort to formulate commands. This is a notable claim in an industry where some users are requesting a return to physical controls over complex touchscreens. Addressing Challenges and Future Possibilities for Generative AI in Vehicles Implementing advanced Generative AI like Gemini in a dynamic environment like a car presents challenges. Initially, Gemini will rely on Google’s cloud processing for both Android Auto and cars with Google Built-In. However, Google is collaborating with automakers to integrate more compute power into vehicles, enabling Gemini to run at the edge. Running AI models locally can improve performance and reliability, crucial factors in a moving vehicle that might experience inconsistent network connectivity. Modern cars also generate vast amounts of data from sensors, cameras, and other systems. The potential for AI in cars to leverage this multimodal data is significant. While Google hasn’t made specific announcements yet, the company acknowledges the potential use cases, particularly with the increasing number of cameras in vehicles. This could lead to future features that are currently only theoretical. Who Gets Google Gemini and When? The rollout of Google Gemini on Android Auto and Google Built-In will extend to all countries where Google’s generative AI model is currently available. The service will support more than 40 languages, ensuring broad accessibility for users worldwide. This integration marks a significant step in bringing sophisticated AI capabilities directly into the daily lives of drivers. As AI technology continues to advance, its presence in commonplace devices like car infotainment systems highlights the broader trend of AI becoming increasingly embedded in our physical world, a trend that has interesting parallels and implications for the development of decentralized technologies and the infrastructure that supports both AI and blockchain. In conclusion, Google’s introduction of Gemini to Android Auto is set to dramatically change the in-car user experience. By providing a more natural, intelligent, and conversational interface, this Android Auto AI aims to make driving more efficient and enjoyable. While challenges related to processing power and data utilization are still being addressed, the potential for future enhancements using vehicle data is substantial. This move underscores the growing importance of Generative AI and In-car AI , pushing the boundaries of what we expect from connected vehicles.

According to analyst Josh, XRP is showing strong signs of a bullish trend right now. A bearish signal that had been hanging over the market for months has finally been invalidated. Since the start of the year, analysts were watching a bearish divergence play out — but now, XRP’s RSI on the 3-day chart has made a higher high. That’s a clear sign the bearish phase is over, and the market can start expecting more positive momentum ahead. XRP Price Analysis: On the daily chart, things look even better. XRP has officially broken out above a key resistance level at around $2.46. This daily candle close above resistance confirms the breakout and signals the start of a new bullish trend. In other words — XRP is no longer stuck in a downtrend and is starting to move upward again. The next important price levels to watch as possible resistance points are $2.60, $2.77, $2.95, $3.15, and $3.30. As for support, the old resistance line at $2.45–$2.46 is now expected to act as a new support zone. Overall, the XRP price chart is flashing bullish signals. The market has cleared out the earlier negative patterns, confirmed a breakout, and regained momentum. If Bitcoin and the broader crypto market also stay bullish, it could give XRP and other altcoins an extra boost in the coming days. Are Sellers Being Absorbed on Binance? XRP futures trading is showing signs of life again, with open interest rising after a sharp drop, hinting at growing trader interest and possible volatility ahead. The market is currently balanced, but short positions are quietly increasing while XRP’s price holds steady — a sign that sellers might be getting absorbed by bigger buyers.

A recent incident in Paris serves as a stark and unwelcome reminder that the risks associated with significant crypto holdings aren’t confined to the digital realm. Physical security is paramount, and a shocking event unfolded that highlights this critical need for enhanced Crypto entrepreneur security . The Alarming Incident: A Look at the Cryptocurrency Kidnapping Attempt Reports emerged detailing a terrifying incident in the heart of Paris, France. According to The Block, a targeted attack occurred aimed at the family of a cryptocurrency entrepreneur. The specific event involved an attempted Cryptocurrency kidnapping . Here’s what we know based on the initial reports: Location: The incident took place in the 11th arrondissement of Paris. Time: The attempt occurred in the morning, around 8:20 a.m. local time. Targets: The masked assailants reportedly attempted to abduct the entrepreneur’s daughter and grandchild. Perpetrators: Three masked men were involved in the attempted abduction. Current Status: Paris police are actively investigating and are said to be hunting for the suspects involved in this disturbing event. This wasn’t a random act; it was a targeted strike, seemingly motivated by the perceived wealth linked to the crypto entrepreneur. It underscores a growing concern within the community: as crypto assets become more valuable and individuals’ holdings grow, they can become targets for physical crime. Why Target Crypto Wealth? Understanding the Motivation Behind Paris Crime Crypto The world of cryptocurrency is often associated with anonymity or pseudonymity, leading some to believe that crypto wealth is untouchable by traditional criminals. However, this incident, and others like it, demonstrate a dangerous reality. Individuals known or believed to possess significant crypto assets can become high-value targets for physical crime, including kidnapping, extortion, and home invasions. Several factors make Crypto wealth security a unique challenge and contribute to incidents like the one seen in Paris: Perceived High Value: Crypto’s rapid price appreciation has created many new millionaires and billionaires, often publicly known or suspected. This visible or rumored wealth attracts criminal attention. Difficulty in Recovery: While blockchain transactions are transparent, tracing funds quickly and recovering them after a forced transfer can be incredibly difficult, making it an attractive target for criminals seeking irreversible gains. Information Leakage: Details about large holdings or successful crypto ventures can sometimes be gleaned from public profiles, social media, or even careless conversations, providing criminals with potential targets. Physical Vulnerability: Unlike digital hacks which require technical skill, physical attacks leverage basic criminal tactics – intimidation, force, and coercion – to gain access to digital assets held by a person. The convergence of significant, potentially hard-to-trace wealth and the physical presence of the asset holder creates a dangerous scenario, contributing to the rise of incidents categorized under Paris crime crypto and similar events globally. Beyond the Headlines: What This Means for Crypto Entrepreneur Security This attempted kidnapping in Paris serves as a grave warning. It’s a reminder that the security strategy for anyone with significant crypto holdings must extend far beyond digital wallets and private keys. Crypto entrepreneur security needs to encompass robust personal and physical security measures. The challenge lies in the fact that while digital security can be managed remotely, physical security requires constant vigilance and proactive measures in the real world. High-profile individuals in the crypto space, or even those simply known within their local community to have done well in crypto, face risks that require professional assessment and planning. Examples of past incidents, ranging from home invasions targeting hardware wallets to physical threats aimed at extorting crypto, highlight that this is not an isolated phenomenon but a growing concern that security experts are increasingly addressing. Actionable Insights: Enhancing Security for Crypto Holders While the Paris incident is unsettling, it provides an opportunity for the community to reassess and strengthen security practices. Enhancing Security for crypto holders involves a multi-layered approach: 1. Bolster Physical Security: Discretion: Be extremely cautious about discussing your crypto holdings or success publicly or even among casual acquaintances. Home Security: Invest in advanced home security systems, including alarms, cameras, reinforced entry points, and potentially safe rooms. Routine Variance: Avoid predictable daily routines that criminals could exploit. Professional Assessment: Consider hiring security consultants to assess your personal risk profile and recommend tailored physical security measures. Travel Safety: Be extra vigilant when traveling, especially to unfamiliar locations. 2. Strengthen Digital Security (Still Crucial): Cold Storage: Store significant amounts of crypto offline using hardware wallets or other cold storage methods. Strong Authentication: Use strong, unique passwords and enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) on all accounts. Beware of Phishing: Be highly skeptical of unsolicited messages or links asking for personal or wallet information. Limit Online Information: Minimize the amount of personal information linked to your crypto activities online. 3. Manage Information Exposure: Social Media: Be mindful of what you post online that could indicate wealth, location, or daily habits. Public Appearances: If you are a public figure in crypto, work with security professionals for events and appearances. Implementing these steps can significantly reduce the risk of becoming a target for physical attacks motivated by crypto wealth. It’s not about living in fear, but about taking sensible precautions in a landscape where digital success can unfortunately create real-world vulnerabilities. The ongoing police hunt in Paris is a critical development, and the community awaits further information regarding the suspects and their potential connection to the victim’s crypto activities. This event serves as a somber reminder that as the crypto world evolves, so too do the methods employed by criminals seeking to exploit it. The safety of individuals and their families must be a top priority. This incident in Paris underscores the urgent need for increased awareness and proactive measures regarding physical security within the crypto community.

44590455,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=160072,1747186251,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shockwave: Abraxas Capital’s Massive $478M Ethereum Purchase Signals Strong Institutional Confidence,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/abraxas-capital-buys-ethereum/,"The world of cryptocurrency often witnesses significant movements, but few grab attention quite like a major institutional player making a substantial investment. Recent reports indicate that asset manager Abraxas Capital has been on an aggressive accumulation spree, particularly focused on Ethereum (ETH). This move, involving hundreds of millions of dollars, is not just a headline; it’s a potential indicator of shifting sentiment and growing confidence among traditional finance giants regarding the digital asset space, specifically concerning Ethereum . What Exactly Did Abraxas Capital Acquire? According to data highlighted by blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain on the social media platform X, Abraxas Capital has significantly increased its holdings of Ethereum over a very short period. The core of the news reveals a staggering acquisition: Over the past six days, Abraxas Capital reportedly purchased a total of 211,030 ETH . At the time of the report, this substantial accumulation was valued at approximately $477.6 million . A notable portion of this came in the last 12 hours preceding the report, with an additional 33,482 ETH acquired, valued at around $84.7 million . This rapid pace of acquisition underscores a deliberate strategy by Abraxas Capital to build a significant position in Ethereum . Such large-scale purchases by institutional entities are often interpreted as bullish signals for the underlying asset and the broader crypto market . Why Are Institutions Like Abraxas Capital Looking at Ethereum? The interest from institutional players in Ethereum is multifaceted. While Bitcoin is often seen as ‘digital gold’ and the primary store of value in the crypto space, Ethereum offers a different value proposition that appeals to sophisticated investors: Foundation of Web3: Ethereum is the leading smart contract platform, serving as the backbone for decentralized finance (DeFi), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps). Investing in ETH is, in essence, investing in the infrastructure of the next generation of the internet. Yield Opportunities: With the transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), Ethereum offers staking rewards. Institutions can earn a yield on their ETH holdings, making it an attractive asset compared to traditional low-yield investments. Network Effect: Ethereum boasts the largest developer community and the most established ecosystem among smart contract platforms. This network effect creates a powerful moat, attracting more users and innovation. Evolving Economics: The implementation of EIP-1559 introduced a burning mechanism for transaction fees, making ETH potentially deflationary under certain network conditions. This scarcity model is appealing to investors. Diversification: For institutions primarily holding Bitcoin or traditional assets, adding Ethereum provides diversification within the digital asset class, capturing exposure to the smart contract and dApp ecosystem. Abraxas Capital ‘s decision to allocate nearly half a billion dollars towards Ethereum suggests a strong conviction in these underlying fundamentals and the long-term growth potential of the network. What Does This Massive Purchase Mean for the Crypto Market and ETH Price? Institutional inflows of this magnitude can have several significant impacts on the crypto market and specifically the ETH price : Potential Impact Area Explanation Increased Demand Large purchases directly increase demand for ETH, potentially pushing the price upwards, especially if supply on exchanges is limited. Market Confidence Significant buys by known entities like Abraxas Capital signal validation to other investors, potentially encouraging further institutional and retail participation. Liquidity Dynamics As institutions accumulate and potentially move assets off exchanges for long-term holding or staking, it can reduce available supply for trading, impacting market liquidity. Price Stability (Potentially) Institutional holders often have longer time horizons than retail traders, which could contribute to more stable price action in the long run, although volatility remains inherent in the crypto market . Narrative Building These events reinforce the narrative of institutional adoption, which is a key driver for broader market growth and regulatory clarity. While a single purchase, even a large one, doesn’t guarantee a sustained price increase, it adds significant buying pressure and contributes positively to the overall market sentiment surrounding Ethereum and the viability of the crypto market for large-scale investment. Are There Challenges or Risks Associated with Such Large Institutional Bets? Investing in cryptocurrency, even for experienced asset managers like Abraxas Capital , comes with inherent risks and challenges: Market Volatility: The crypto market is known for its extreme price swings. A nearly $500 million position is subject to significant fluctuations, potentially leading to substantial unrealized gains or losses in short periods. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Changes in regulations could impact the usability, legality, or tax treatment of Ethereum holdings. Security Risks: Holding large amounts of digital assets requires robust security measures to protect against hacks, theft, or loss of private keys. Institutions must employ sophisticated custody solutions. Execution Risk: Acquiring such a large amount of ETH without significantly moving the market requires careful execution, often utilizing over-the-counter (OTC) desks rather than public exchanges. Liquidity for Exit: While the market is liquid, exiting a position of this size without impacting the ETH price could also present challenges. Abraxas Capital , as a professional asset manager, is undoubtedly aware of these risks and likely has strategies in place to mitigate them. Their willingness to proceed with such a large investment suggests they believe the potential rewards outweigh these challenges. Looking Ahead: What Could This Mean for the Future of Ethereum? The move by Abraxas Capital is more than just a snapshot in time; it’s a data point contributing to a larger trend of increasing institutional interest in Ethereum . If more asset managers follow suit, the implications could be profound: Increased Stability: Greater institutional participation could potentially lead to a more mature and stable market over time, as large holders are less likely to engage in panic selling. Further Innovation: Institutional capital flowing into the ecosystem can help fund development and innovation within the Ethereum network and its associated dApps. Regulatory Clarity: As more established financial players enter the space, it increases the pressure on regulators to provide clear guidelines, which can benefit the entire crypto market . Mainstream Adoption: Institutional adoption paves the way for easier access and understanding for mainstream investors and corporations. The long-term ETH price trajectory will depend on a confluence of factors, including network development, regulatory environment, macroeconomic conditions, and continued adoption. However, significant institutional accumulation like that seen from Abraxas Capital is undoubtedly a positive sign for the asset’s future prospects. Conclusion: A Bullish Signal from a Big Player Abraxas Capital ‘s reported acquisition of 211,030 ETH, valued at nearly $478 million, over just six days is a powerful statement. It highlights growing institutional conviction in Ethereum as a core digital asset, separate from or alongside Bitcoin. This significant capital inflow provides a strong vote of confidence in the network’s technology, ecosystem, and future potential. While the crypto market remains volatile and subject to various influences, moves of this scale from established asset managers are key indicators of the ongoing maturation and increasing acceptance of digital assets within traditional finance. Investors and enthusiasts alike will be watching closely to see how this trend develops and its ultimate impact on the ETH price and the broader market.

44591099,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=160075,1747187445,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Tencent Secures Controversial Microsoft AI Team WizardLM,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/tencent-hires-microsoft-wizardlm/,"In a significant development within the artificial intelligence landscape, Chinese tech giant Tencent appears to have onboarded the WizardLM team, a group of AI researchers previously associated with Microsoft. This move is particularly noteworthy given WizardLM’s recent history and highlights the intense competition for top AI talent and technology. Tencent’s Strategic Move in AI Tencent, the powerhouse behind platforms like WeChat and popular games including PUBG Mobile, is making aggressive strides in artificial intelligence. The company’s AI development organization, Hunyuan, is reportedly the new home for the WizardLM researchers. This strategic acquisition underscores Tencent’s commitment to bolstering its AI capabilities and accelerating its model development efforts. Can Xu, a senior AI researcher who played a leading role in several WizardLM projects, announced the team’s departure from Microsoft to join Tencent’s Hunyuan group via a post on X. Understanding WizardLM’s Past at Microsoft AI The WizardLM team, which originated several years ago, has a somewhat unusual past, particularly during its time under the Microsoft AI umbrella. In April 2024, the team released the WizardLM-2 family of AI models, which they claimed were competitive with leading models like OpenAI’s GPT-4. However, these models were quickly pulled from public access by Microsoft after just one day. The reason cited was a missed step in the release process: toxicity testing. The team acknowledged this oversight on X, stating they were completing the testing and planned to re-release the models soon. The Fallout from WizardLM-2’s Removal Despite Microsoft’s swift action, users had already downloaded and reuploaded the original WizardLM-2 models, along with customized versions. The sudden removal also caused disruption within the open-source AI community. Hugging Face CEO Clément Delangue noted that the deletion of WizardLM models, which were downloaded hundreds of thousands of times monthly, harmed numerous open-source projects dependent on them. This incident highlighted the complexities and responsibilities involved in releasing powerful AI models, even for established tech giants like Microsoft. Tencent’s Growing Hunyuan AI Power With the integration of the WizardLM team, Tencent’s Hunyuan AI efforts are expected to gain further momentum. Hunyuan has recently launched various AI models, including generators for video and 3D objects. The collaboration has already yielded results, with the release of the Hunyuan-TurboS 0416 model. Qingfeng Sun, identifying as a “co-founder” of WizardLM, has claimed that Hunyuan-TurboS 0416 surpasses certain “open” AI models, specifically mentioning Google’s Gemma 3 series, in performance. This suggests that the WizardLM team is continuing its focus on developing high-performing AI models within its new environment. Tencent has significantly increased its investment in AI infrastructure and recently restructured the Hunyuan team into two new units. The company attributed an 8% year-over-year growth in Q1 2025 partly to its AI investments. Tencent plans substantial capital expenditures this year, approximately 90 billion yuan (around $12.49 billion), with a significant portion allocated to fuel its AI ambitions. The addition of the WizardLM team aligns with this aggressive investment strategy aimed at strengthening Tencent’s position in the global AI race. Implications for the Future of AI Models The acquisition of a skilled team like WizardLM by Tencent signifies the ongoing talent war in the AI sector. While the exact number of researchers moving to Tencent is unclear, the integration of their expertise into the Hunyuan platform is likely to accelerate the development of new AI models. The competition between major players like Tencent, Microsoft, Google, and others continues to drive innovation. The rapid release and comparison of models like Hunyuan-TurboS 0416 against competitors underscore the fast-paced nature of this field. The move also raises questions about the future direction of open-source contributions from teams previously associated with large corporations and the balance between rapid development and responsible deployment, as highlighted by the WizardLM-2 incident. In conclusion, Tencent’s reported hiring of the WizardLM team from Microsoft is a major development that strengthens its Hunyuan AI division. Despite WizardLM’s controversial history surrounding the release and subsequent withdrawal of its models at Microsoft, the team’s expertise is now set to contribute to Tencent’s ambitious AI goals. This move highlights the intense competition for AI talent and resources, promising further advancements and shifts in the landscape of AI model development.

He also announced that Coinbase is investing an undisclosed sum in it to increase access to tokenized Canadian dollars at the Blockchain Futurist Conference in Toronto. According to Matheson, they requested the federal government create a national digital assets strategy. Based on his argument, crypto is strategic; therefore, they hoped the new administration would recognize the strategic importance of cryptocurrency. This followed the April federal elections in Canada, which resulted in the election of Prime Minister Mark Carney, who had previously expressed disapproval of cryptocurrencies. Matheson highlights the necessity of a stablecoin for the Canadian market In an exclusive interview on May 13, Matheson acknowledged the existence of a stablecoin for Canadians as crucial. He further stated that stablecoins are particularly necessary because the nation has “no peer-to-peer [payment] rail” and “wire transfers cost $45 and take 45 minutes of paperwork.” Moreover, he claimed that stablecoins make it possible to make 24/7, instantaneous, borderless payments, which was already possible with current technology. According to Stablecorp’s website, the most recent report on QCAD’s fiat reserve backing was from July 2024, when there was only about $175,000 worth of QCAD in circulation. On the other hand, the US dollar-backed stablecoins Tether and USDC make up the majority of the stablecoins’ $245 billion market capitalization as of May 13, according to CoinGecko data. In light of these variations in the stablecoins, Matheson emphasized the need for a stablecoin created especially for the Canadian market to solve present problems with the payment infrastructure. In addition, Coinbase stated in a blog post on March 26 that Canada lacked a clear path for stablecoin adoption , partly because its government has not yet removed securities regulation barriers for fiat-backed stablecoins. The exchange further stated that it must start considering instruments instead of securities. Meanwhile, according to the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s April statement, if stablecoins were only promoted to make payments, they are not considered securities in the country. Canadian voters expressed their strong desire for a digital assets strategy during the April election According to WonderFi CEO and President Dean Skurka, Canadian voters demonstrated that they wanted the government to take action on cryptocurrency when they cast their ballots on April 28. Based on his argument, this could be achieved if policymakers followed the United States and Europe in fostering an environment more conducive to blockchain development. Additionally, that month, Canadians eagerly awaited the political leaders’ plans regarding digital assets as the country’s federal election approached. This resulted from millions of Canadians owning, using, or working in cryptocurrency, which was becoming an increasingly important area for innovation and economic growth. Most of this active base was under 50, making them a powerful political force. The election and the administration had an opportunity for policymakers to encourage voters’ desire for clarity regarding Canada’s digital future. In 2022, Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre gained popularity when he supported Bitcoin and decentralized finance, giving people more control over their finances and, therefore, less control over politicians and banks. He aimed to make Canada the world’s blockchain capital and for its people to embrace digital currencies such as Bitcoin to escape inflation. While he is a fan of digital innovation, Mark Carney, a former governor of the Bank of Canada affiliated with the Liberal Party, has yet to be persuaded that digital coins such as stablecoins will upend the monetary system. He has argued that digital currency would have a more solid and secure foundation because of central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs He said stablecoins were not a revolutionary alternative to the traditional monetary system but merely an extension. Carney stated that CBDCs would form the basis of a more stable, programmable financial future and lower the risks associated with digital currency.

The focus? The Federal Reserve and the possibility of an Interest Rate Cut . Understanding the Trump Fed Pressure Donald Trump has a history of expressing strong opinions regarding the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy, particularly its benchmark interest rate. His recent remarks on Truth Social continue this trend, directly urging the Fed to lower rates again. This isn’t just a casual suggestion; it’s a pointed commentary aimed at influencing the independent central bank’s decisions. Why is Trump pushing for this now? He points to what he sees as falling prices in the U.S., arguing that this indicates a lack of inflation. His logic is straightforward: if prices aren’t rising, or are even declining, then the primary reason the Fed might keep rates high (controlling inflation) isn’t valid. He contrasts the U.S. situation with that of Europe and China, which have pursued lower interest rate policies, suggesting the U.S. should follow suit to remain competitive or stimulate growth. Key Argument: Falling prices negate the need for high rates. Comparative Stance: U.S. should align with lower rates seen in Europe and China. Underlying Goal: Likely aims to stimulate economic activity. Why the Call for an Interest Rate Cut ? Examining the Logic An Interest Rate Cut by the Federal Reserve typically serves to make borrowing money cheaper for businesses and consumers. This can encourage spending and investment, potentially boosting economic growth. Trump’s argument hinges on the idea that the current economic climate, characterized by his perception of falling prices and lack of inflation, warrants such stimulus rather than restrictive monetary policy. However, the Fed’s perspective is often more nuanced. They look at a wide range of economic indicators, including employment data, wage growth, consumer spending, and crucially, various measures of Inflation Data . While some specific prices might fall, the overall inflation picture, according to official metrics like the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, is what the Fed primarily monitors to achieve its dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices. Comparing the U.S. to Europe and China is also complex. Each economy faces unique challenges and operates under different structures. While lower rates might be appropriate for their specific conditions, the Fed must set policy based on the health and outlook of the US Economy . The Current State of the US Economy and the Fed’s Stance The Federal Reserve operates independently of political pressure, though it is accountable to Congress. Its decisions on interest rates are made by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) based on extensive economic analysis. In recent times, the Fed aggressively raised rates to combat inflation that surged after the pandemic. More recently, they have paused rate hikes, signaling a data-dependent approach. The current state of the US Economy is subject to various interpretations. While the labor market has remained relatively strong, there are ongoing debates about the pace of inflation reduction, the impact of higher rates on different sectors, and the potential for a future slowdown. The Fed has repeatedly stated it wants to see clear evidence that inflation is sustainably moving towards its 2% target before considering rate cuts. Challenges the Fed faces include: Balancing inflation control with supporting economic growth. Navigating global economic uncertainties. Maintaining credibility and independence from political influence, like the Trump Fed Pressure . Interpreting conflicting economic signals (e.g., strong jobs vs. potential manufacturing slowdown). Potential Crypto Market Impact of Rate Decisions So, why should cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors pay attention to this debate over an Interest Rate Cut ? Because monetary policy decisions by the Fed can have a significant Crypto Market Impact . Here’s a simplified look at the connection: Lower Interest Rates: Make traditional, safer investments (like bonds or savings accounts) less attractive due to lower returns. Can lead investors to seek higher returns in riskier assets. Increase liquidity in the financial system, making capital more available. Can potentially benefit risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies, as investors might allocate more capital to them in search of yield or growth. Higher Interest Rates (or maintaining high rates): Make traditional assets more attractive, drawing capital away from riskier investments. Reduce liquidity as borrowing becomes more expensive. Can put downward pressure on assets perceived as speculative, including cryptocurrencies. Therefore, the prospect of an Interest Rate Cut , especially if it signals a shift towards easier monetary policy, is often viewed positively by the crypto market. Conversely, the Fed maintaining higher rates, or even the threat of future hikes (though less likely now), can be seen as a headwind. What About Inflation Data and its Role? Trump’s argument heavily relies on his interpretation of falling prices and lack of Inflation Data . However, the Fed looks at a broader, more official set of statistics. While some goods might see price declines, the services sector and wages have shown more persistence in inflation. The Fed’s decisions are heavily weighted by whether they believe inflation is truly under control and moving towards their target. If the official Inflation Data remains sticky, the Fed will be hesitant to cut rates, regardless of political calls like the Trump Fed Pressure . A premature cut could risk reigniting inflationary pressures, forcing the Fed to potentially hike rates again later, which would likely be disruptive for the US Economy and financial markets, including potentially a negative Crypto Market Impact . Actionable Insights for Crypto Watchers Given the potential Crypto Market Impact , what should you watch? Fed Meetings: Pay close attention to FOMC meeting announcements and press conferences. Listen for clues about their outlook on inflation, employment, and future rate plans. Economic Data: Monitor key economic releases, especially official Inflation Data (CPI, PCE), jobs reports, and GDP growth. These are the metrics guiding the Fed. Political Commentary: While not directly controlling the Fed, political pressure like the Trump Fed Pressure can add noise and sometimes signal broader political priorities regarding the US Economy . Market Reactions: Observe how the crypto market reacts immediately following Fed announcements and major economic data releases. Conclusion: Navigating the Economic Winds Donald Trump’s renewed calls for an Interest Rate Cut highlight the ongoing debate about the direction of the US Economy and the appropriate stance for the Federal Reserve. While his arguments center on falling prices and comparison to other global economies, the Fed’s decision-making process is guided by a broader set of official Inflation Data and economic indicators, striving for price stability and maximum employment. For those interested in the potential Crypto Market Impact , understanding the dynamics between monetary policy, inflation, and economic growth is crucial. An Interest Rate Cut could potentially serve as a tailwind for risk assets like cryptocurrencies, but the timing and context of such a move are paramount. The ongoing Trump Fed Pressure adds a political layer to an already complex economic picture. Ultimately, the Fed will make its decision based on the data, but the public discussion, fueled by figures like Trump, keeps the spotlight firmly on the critical role of interest rates in the global financial landscape.

The IPO raised about $310 million, with the company and existing investors selling nearly six million shares . With that, eToro has been valued at around $4.2 billion in a successful debut on the public markets in a cautiously optimistic period for tech IPOs. EToro said in its prospectus that BlackRock had expressed interest in buying $100 million shares at the IPO price. The company planned to sell 5 million shares in the offering, with existing investors and executives selling another 5 million. Crypto boom drives eToro’s $50M profit surge eToro had the financial footing to ease its path to a successful IPO. In 2024, the company said, net income surged to $192.4 million from $15.3 million. This growth reflected the platform’s rising interest in cryptocurrency and the active participation of users worldwide. The company has been ramping up its crypto business, with revenue from crypto assets more than tripling to over $12 million in 2024. One-quarter of its net trading contribution last year came from crypto, up from 10% the prior year. eToro generates revenue from trading fees through spreads on buy and sell orders and from non-trading services, like currency conversions and withdrawal fees. It competes with other upstart retail trading platforms, including Robinhood and Webull, in offering traditional stock trading and access to crypto assets. By December 2024, the company had 3.5 million funded accounts from more than 75 countries, which showed a growing international momentum. eToro revives investor confidence with strong IPO The timing of eToro’s public offering could not be better. The IPO market stopped in recent years but has shown signs of life. The return of President Donald Trump to the White House in January 2025 and the stabilization of interest rates and decline in inflation have breathed new life into the public offerings market. Earlier in the year, GPU cloud infrastructure company CoreWeave went public with a successful debut, opening the door for companies like eToro, Klarna, and StubHub to dip their toes. Temporary fears over tariffs had delayed their plans, but eToro moved ahead after market confidence started to return. This is not eToro’s first try at going public. It had intended to merge with a special-purpose acquisition vehicle, or SPAC, in a deal that would have valued the business at more than $10 billion by 2022. But that plan was grounded by a larger market slide. Yoni Assia, the chief executive and a co-founder of the company, which was founded in 2007 with his brother Ronen Assia and David Ring, said earlier in 2024 that they were continuing to ready the company for a public debut, “assessing the right opportunity.” Now officially listed on the Nasdaq, eToro is set to drive a paradigm shift in how ordinary people trade, invest, and participate in financial markets. The success of eToro’s IPO is now increasingly being closely followed as a litmus test for the pipeline of tech and fintech IPOs, with companies like Hinge Health and Chime next in line to do so.

All three victims suffered injuries and were taken to a local hospital. Local outlet Le Parisien reported that the botched daylight kidnapping is being investigated by the Brigade for the Suppression of Banditry, a special police unit of the French Ministry of the Interior. Michael Englander, co-founder and CEO of Polish crypto exchange Plasbit , says this incident should serve as a wake-up call for the rest of the industry. “If you’re in crypto and still flaunting it online, you’re not just stupid, you’re putting your family in danger,” he said in a May 13 post to X. Offline crypto-linked attacks grow Crypto-focused lawyer Sasha Hodder said on X that “crypto theft is evolving. It’s not just social engineering or SIM swaps anymore.” In May, Las Vegas police said three teenagers had allegedly kidnapped a man at gunpoint who was returning from a local crypto event and robbed him of $4 million in crypto and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). On May 3, Paris police freed the father of a crypto entrepreneur who was held for several days in connection with a 7 million euro ($7.8 million) kidnapping plot. At the start of the year, David Balland, co-founder of crypto hardware wallet manufacturer Ledger, was abducted from his home in central France during the early hours of Jan. 21. He was held captive until a police operation on the night of Jan. 22 secured his release.

44591629,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=160084,1747188639,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,SEC Solana ETF Decision: Uncertainty Lingers After Delay,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-solana-etf-delay/,"The world of cryptocurrency ETFs is buzzing, but not always with good news. The latest development stirring the pot involves a potential new player: Solana. Specifically, Grayscale’s ambitious proposal for a Spot Solana ETF has hit a temporary roadblock. According to reports, the SEC Solana ETF decision timeline has been pushed back. This news, initially shared by Unfolded on X, indicates that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) needs more time to deliberate on Grayscale’s application. For many watching the space, this Solana ETF delay isn’t entirely surprising, given the SEC’s cautious approach to new crypto products, especially those beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Understanding the Grayscale Solana ETF Proposal Grayscale is a familiar name in the crypto investment landscape, known for its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which recently converted into a spot Bitcoin ETF. Building on that success and the growing interest in alternative cryptocurrencies, Grayscale proposed a spot ETF that would hold Solana (SOL) directly. A spot ETF allows investors to gain exposure to the price movements of an underlying asset without directly owning the asset itself. For a Grayscale Solana ETF , this would mean the fund holds actual SOL tokens, and investors buy shares in the fund. This structure is often preferred by traditional investors and institutions as it fits within existing regulatory frameworks and investment platforms. The potential benefits of such a product are significant: Increased Accessibility: Makes investing in Solana easier for traditional investors. Enhanced Liquidity: Could bring more capital into the Solana ecosystem. Regulatory Clarity: An approved ETF provides a level of legitimacy and regulatory comfort. Institutional Adoption: Opens the door for large institutions to invest in Solana. However, getting any crypto ETF approved, especially for an altcoin like Solana, is a complex process subject to stringent crypto ETF regulation . Why the SEC Decision Delay? The SEC’s primary mandate is investor protection. When considering a new financial product like a Spot Solana ETF, they scrutinize various factors. A SEC decision delay typically signals that the commission requires additional time to review the application thoroughly, gather more information, or address specific concerns. Potential reasons for this delay could include: Market Surveillance and Manipulation Concerns: The SEC needs to be confident that the underlying market for Solana is resistant to manipulation. While the Bitcoin market is large and has established surveillance sharing agreements (particularly with the CME futures market), the SEC might have different or additional questions regarding the Solana spot market structure, liquidity, and trading venues. Solana’s Unique Characteristics: Unlike Bitcoin, Solana utilizes a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism and has different network dynamics. The SEC may be evaluating the implications of these technical differences from a regulatory standpoint. Precedent Setting: Approving a Spot Solana ETF would set a significant precedent for other altcoin ETFs. The SEC might be cautious about opening the floodgates to a wide array of single-asset altcoin ETFs without a clear framework or criteria. Application Complexity: ETF applications are detailed documents. The SEC might have questions about the fund’s structure, custody arrangements for the SOL tokens, valuation methods, and risk disclosures. Workload and Priorities: The SEC handles numerous filings across various financial sectors. Delays can sometimes simply be a matter of managing a heavy workload and prioritizing reviews. What Does This Solana ETF Delay Mean for the Market? A Solana ETF delay introduces a period of uncertainty. While not an outright rejection, it pushes back the timeline for potential institutional investment and broader market access that an ETF could provide. Market reactions to such delays can vary, but often involve a temporary dip in asset price due to reduced immediate optimism, or simply sideways movement as participants await further clarity. For Solana specifically, the delay means the potential price catalyst of a spot ETF approval is now further out. Investors and traders who were anticipating a quick decision based on the pace of Bitcoin ETF approvals will need to adjust their expectations. The focus now shifts back to Solana’s fundamentals, network development, and the broader crypto market sentiment while the regulatory process unfolds. This situation also highlights the ongoing challenges in crypto ETF regulation . Each new asset class presents unique questions for regulators, and the path to mainstream financial products like ETFs is often slow and deliberate. The outcome of the SEC Solana ETF decision will be closely watched not just for Solana, but for its implications for other altcoins seeking similar investment vehicles. Challenges and Opportunities in Crypto ETF Regulation The regulatory path for crypto ETFs is fraught with challenges. The SEC has historically expressed concerns about market volatility, potential for manipulation, and investor protection in the crypto space. While the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs marked a significant turning point, it doesn’t automatically pave the way for all other cryptocurrencies. Challenges: Establishing robust surveillance mechanisms for diverse crypto markets. Determining which assets meet the SEC’s criteria for being suitable for a spot ETF. Addressing custody and security risks associated with holding various digital assets. Navigating the evolving legal and regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies globally. Opportunities: Increased clarity from regulatory bodies can foster innovation and investment. Approved ETFs can provide safer, more familiar investment avenues for a wider audience. The process pushes for greater maturity and transparency in crypto markets. Successful frameworks for one asset can potentially be adapted for others. The SEC decision delay on the Grayscale Solana ETF is a clear indicator that the regulatory journey for altcoin ETFs is far from over and will likely involve careful, step-by-step evaluations. Actionable Insights for Investors Given the uncertainty introduced by the Solana ETF delay , what should investors consider? Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on official announcements from the SEC and updates from Grayscale. The reasons for the delay and the new deadline will provide crucial context. Focus on Fundamentals: While regulatory news impacts price, the long-term value of Solana depends on its technology, adoption, developer activity, and ecosystem growth. Evaluate these factors independently of ETF speculation. Manage Expectations: Understand that the path to a Spot Solana ETF approval may be lengthy and involve further delays or even potential rejection. Don’t base investment decisions solely on the assumption of imminent ETF approval. Consider Diversification: Don’t place all your bets on a single asset or a single catalyst like an ETF approval. Diversify your crypto holdings based on your risk tolerance and research. Understand Regulatory Risk: Recognize that regulatory decisions, including those related to crypto ETF regulation , are a significant factor influencing the crypto market. The SEC decision delay is part of the standard regulatory process, but it underscores the ongoing scrutiny faced by the crypto industry as it seeks to integrate with traditional finance. Conclusion: A Waiting Game Continues The SEC’s decision to delay its ruling on the Grayscale Solana ETF application extends the period of anticipation for the Solana community and the broader crypto market. While not a definitive setback, it highlights the regulatory hurdles that remain for cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum seeking mainstream investment products like spot ETFs. The reasons behind the SEC decision delay likely revolve around a thorough examination of the Solana market’s structure, potential for manipulation, and the implications of setting a precedent for altcoin ETFs under existing crypto ETF regulation . The outcome of this review will be a critical moment for Solana and will provide further insight into the SEC’s approach to regulating the evolving digital asset landscape. For now, it’s a waiting game. The market will continue to operate based on existing factors, with the potential boost from a spot Solana ETF pushed further into the future. The focus remains on fundamental developments within the Solana ecosystem and the ongoing dialogue between innovators like Grayscale and regulators like the SEC.

This capital infusion marks one of the strongest waves of professional crypto adoption seen in recent quarters. The trend signals rising confidence among institutional buyers in the long-term value of digital assets, suggesting renewed momentum in both price performance and network fundamentals.While many established tokens have surged in value amid this backdrop, emerging platforms like Qubetics ($TICS) are gaining traction for a different reason. Unlike earlier projects that faced technical limitations, Qubetics is purpose-built for scalable, enterprise-grade utility. Its architecture addresses the operational challenges businesses and professionals face in cross-border communications, privacy, and finance. This is why Qubetics has rapidly become one of the best crypto to buy right now , alongside breakout performers like SUI and Cosmos (ATOM). Much of this fresh capital has flowed into projects with proven utility and high scalability potential. Participants are targeting ecosystems that can solve real-world problems, rather than speculative tokens with short-term hype. This changing capital behavior mirrors the maturation of the asset class—where interoperability, infrastructure, and enterprise adoption are now top considerations. Qubetics ($TICS): A Decentralized VPN and Scalable Infrastructure for Professionals Qubetics is transforming how digital privacy, global business operations, and decentralized communication are handled at scale. At the heart of its offering lies a Decentralized VPN designed to serve individuals, startups, and enterprise clients alike. This secure networking solution eliminates centralized choke points and intermediaries—allowing users to exchange information and assets in real time, across borders, with full sovereignty over their data. For businesses and professionals navigating a fragmented digital landscape, the Qubetics VPN provides low-latency performance, jurisdiction-agnostic access, and unmatched reliability. Whether it’s remote legal teams transferring contracts, cross-border payment processing, or data-sensitive collaboration between institutions, Qubetics addresses the trust gap that still hinders digital transformation globally. Beyond secure connectivity, Qubetics enables seamless integration of tokenized assets and digital services through its advanced interoperability layer. The platform’s architecture supports high throughput, low transaction costs, and customizable governance—key traits for builders and backers seeking future-ready blockchain infrastructure. Qubetics Presale Highlights and ROI Opportunity The Qubetics crypto presale is now in its 34th stage, having already sold more than 512 million tokens to a community of 26,300+ holders. Over $16.9 million has been raised so far, and $TICS tokens are priced at $0.2532 in the current round. For those who act now, entry remains viable with significant upside still in play. Early adopters from Stage 1—who secured $TICS at just $0.01—are now seeing a 2,432% return. Yet participants entering today can still secure an impressive 294% ROI if $TICS hits $1 after the presale. At $5, returns jump to 1,874%, while $6 yields 2,269%. If the token reaches $10 post-mainnet, community members could realize 3,848% gains. Should it soar to $15, the potential ROI hits an exceptional 5,822%. The presale is ongoing, and access remains open. For those seeking the best crypto to buy right now with actual enterprise application, Qubetics is a front-runner with a practical edge. SUI: Breaking Into the Top 11 with High-Volume Momentum SUI has made headlines by climbing to $4.15, marking its highest valuation since January and representing a staggering 1,040% gain from its 2024 low. This ascent has propelled SUI into the top 11 cryptocurrencies, ahead of well-known names like Chainlink, Avalanche, Stellar, and Hedera. From a technical standpoint, SUI is in the final phase of an Elliott Wave impulse pattern, indicating that the current rally could either top out soon or extend further—especially if market euphoria intensifies. The next resistance level to monitor is the all-time high at $5.33. A confirmed move above this threshold could attract widespread attention, especially from retail participants and trading platforms. SUI’s bullish case is supported by strong fundamentals, rapid transaction speeds, and increased developer interest. It is becoming an infrastructure-layer candidate for gaming, tokenization, and consumer Web3 use cases. SUI’s position as one of the best crypto to buy right now is supported by both price strength and its strategic positioning in digital scalability. With momentum intact and bullish chart formations in play, SUI offers breakout potential in the current cycle. Cosmos (ATOM): Interoperability Champion Regains Market Relevance Cosmos is one of the most technically advanced interoperability platforms on the market. As of mid-May 2025, ATOM is trading at $5.09, supported by a $1.99 billion market cap. With a circulating supply of 390.9 million tokens, Cosmos continues to serve as the foundation for interchain communication and modular blockchain design. Its key innovation, the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, allows independent blockchains to exchange data and value in a trustless manner. Cosmos also offers a developer-friendly toolkit for building sovereign, application-specific blockchains that plug into a broader ecosystem. This makes it ideal for scaling decentralized finance, gaming, and cross-chain governance solutions. ATOM has gained 19.42% in the past 30 days, signaling renewed attention from both retail buyers and institutional participants. As Web3 ecosystems demand better composability and scalability, Cosmos stands out as a core infrastructure player with staying power. Cosmos delivers real-world interoperability at scale, backed by consistent network growth. Its modular architecture makes it one of the best crypto to buy right now for those prioritizing multichain futures and blockchain composability. Final Thoughts The injection of $882 million in institutional capital has changed the tempo of the market. Rather than chasing speculative trends, professional buyers are locking into platforms that show scalability, usability, and long-term real-world alignment. Qubetics leads this new wave by merging decentralized infrastructure with practical tools like VPN access, cross-border transactions, and enterprise integrations. SUI has entered the high-cap league with parabolic growth backed by structured patterns and fundamental support. Cosmos reinforces its value through cross-chain communication and network modularity. Each project offers a unique entry point based on its current market positioning and adoption curve. But access is not infinite. With the Qubetics presale still live and rapidly advancing, now is a strategic time to engage with platforms that are building blockchain’s future—not just chasing its past.

For many, that regret is all too real. From DOGE to SHIB, early backers turned a few hundred bucks into life-changing wealth. But here’s the kicker: the next tidal wave is already swelling. Meme coins are resurging—faster, funnier, and fiercer than ever. In the middle of this storm stands BTFD Coin (BTFD) , a blazing-hot new project with a presale that’s igniting serious whale interest. With less than 15 days left until the presale ends on May 26, and analysts throwing around a bold $0.006 moon prediction, investors are scrambling to grab their stake before the window slams shut. This article explores the best meme coins to invest in now, featuring BTFD front and center alongside viral meme contenders that still have fuel in the tank. Let’s dive in while there’s still time to act. 1. BTFD Coin (BTFD) — The Final Dip Before 8900% Liftoff?

Sitting in Stage 15 of its presale at just $0.0002, BTFD is handing out presale deals that are hard to ignore. Over $6.81 million has already been raised. More than 73 billion tokens have been sold to 12,100+ holders. And there’s only one stage left before the explosive May 27 launch. Investors dropping $4500 at this stage grab 22.5 million $BTFD tokens. Apply the LAUNCH200 code , and those tokens triple to 67.5 million. If BTFD hits its projected listing price of $0.0006, that $4500 becomes $40,500. If it moons to $0.006 as predicted? You’re staring at over $400K. But here’s where it gets juicier: staking rewards are live with a 90% APY, and the Bulls Squad P2E game is fully playable—letting users earn as they play. And the hype isn’t just retail-driven. Big buys are starting to flood in. With meme coin whales joining the herd, the BTFD presale is shifting into high gear. This meme coin presale isn’t just another gamble—it’s the best-priced ticket into a bullish ecosystem that rewards early adopters with real utility, community, and monster returns. Why is BTFD among the best meme coins to invest in now? Because it’s one of the only coins giving investors triple tokens, staking rewards, and an 8900% ROI target—and it’s almost over. 2. Floki Inu (FLOKI) — The Viking of Hype Floki Inu continues to ride high on branding, community loyalty, and major marketing pushes. The team has invested heavily in partnerships and ecosystem development, from DeFi to metaverse integrations. It’s seen renewed interest thanks to increased token burns and bullish sentiment on DEXs.

Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) — Divine Degens Unite GOAT is the cult-favorite that mixes divine meme lore with on-chain chaos. Their recent campaign, “Sacrifice for Gains,” brought massive user traction. A quirky staking dashboard and comic-style roadmap give it that degen charm investors can’t ignore. Why did GOAT earn a spot? Because it’s weird, wild, and weirdly winning in all the right communities. 5. Brett (BRETT) — Still Got It Based on the Chad meme, BRETT offers a blend of alpha-male memetics and solid tokenomics. It made headlines after a recent DeFi bridge launch, increasing its on-chain usability. Despite volatility, the Brett Army remains loyal—and loud. Why is Brett here? Because in this market, recognizable memes with loyal fans stay relevant longer. 6. WHY (WHY) — Existential Goldmine WHY takes a nihilistic spin on meme investing. Its whitepaper is just “WHY NOT?” and that’s the joke—but the project has smart contract security and quirky NFT missions that keep its audience hooked. It’s proof that humor and hype still drive volume. Why did WHY make this list of the best meme coins to invest in now? Because sometimes nonsense makes more sense in meme coin season.

At the time of writing, BTC trades at $104,271, narrowing the gap to its all-time high of $109,000. This recent price surge is not occurring in isolation. Instead, it appears closely tied to broader macroeconomic developments, most notably, the recent easing of trade tensions between the US and China, with both countries reducing tariffs on certain imports and exports. Market participants have responded positively to these policy shifts, signaling renewed risk appetite across traditional and digital asset markets. Bitcoin’s rally over the weekend reflects this optimism, with analysts identifying key technical indicators pointing toward rising buyer strength. One such indicator, the Taker Buy Sell Ratio, is gaining attention for marking previous turning points in Bitcoin’s price history. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears All-Time High as $312M BTC Exit Binance Following US-China Trade Deal Bitcoin Taker Buy-Sell Ratio Signals Renewed Bullish Control CryptoQuant contributor G a a h highlighted that the Taker Buy Sell Ratio, a metric measuring the ratio of market buy orders to sell orders, has climbed to a significant threshold of 1.02. Historically, similar levels have coincided with crucial inflection points in Bitcoin’s price movement. For instance, this metric reached comparable highs during the late 2022 lows between $15,000 and $20,000, and again in October 2023 as Bitcoin broke through the $30,000 resistance level. According to G a a h, this recent breakout above the 1.00 line reflects an increase in aggressive buying activity, with market takers once again asserting short-term control. This suggests upward momentum may persist in the near term. However, the analyst also cautioned that these same conditions have previously been followed by volatility spikes, marking both the start and reversal of market trends. The analyst wrote: It’s worth noting that in previous periods, this same level has coincided with reversal zones or strong volatility, marking both the start and end of trends. We are therefore facing a scenario where buyer appetite could continue to drive BTC towards new highs. Realized Price Trends Confirm Ongoing Market Strength In a separate analysis, CryptoQuant analyst Crypto Dan examined Bitcoin’s realized price, a metric that reflects the average purchase price of all circulating BTC, as a tool to gauge market sentiment and directional strength. According to the report, the realized price is still on the rise, indicating that investors are increasingly accumulating BTC at higher prices. This trend differs significantly from previous cycles, where a reversal in the realized price preceded steep corrections. Crypto Dan attributes the current rise to institutional inflows, particularly through spot Bitcoin ETFs and corporate balance sheet purchases. These channels have brought in sustained capital, elevating the average acquisition price and reinforcing market structure. Related Reading: Why The US-China 90-Day Tariff Slash Can Push Bitcoin Price Above $110,000 As institutional players continue to allocate capital into Bitcoin, the realized price trend suggests that the ongoing rally may have more room to extend.

Analyst EGRAG CRYPTO says BTC closing above $109K is crucial for next bullish impulsive wave. Institutional interest in Bitcoin grows while retail is lukewarm; BTC dominance key to watch. Bitcoin (BTC) has once again surged past the six-figure mark, decisively crossing the $100,000 threshold with strong market momentum. As of press time, Bitcoin trades at $103,655 , reflecting nearly a 10% gain over the past week. A key aspect of this Bitcoin price $100k sustainable rally is that it comes without the usual signs of frothiness in the derivatives market. This, according to K33 Research, could signal a more sustainable rally this time around. Bitcoin has reclaimed six digits following continued strong momentum.

44593473,https://thecoinrise.com/is-web3bay-the-shopping-focused-crypto-platform-set-to-make-waves/,1747191616,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecoinrise.png,Is Web3Bay the Shopping-Focused Crypto Platform Set to Make Waves?,https://thecoinrise.com/is-web3bay-the-shopping-focused-crypto-platform-set-to-make-waves/,"In a market where price hype often wins attention, Web3Bay is quietly building a strong case by focusing on everyday shopping. While many crypto projects chase quick gains, Web3Bay is using its 3BAY coin to reward real activity, offering lasting value that few early-stage projects deliver. The idea is simple. Buyers who shop using 3BAY get an instant 5 percent discount. But the rewards do not end there. Buyers also earn daily bonuses, access special product drops, and help guide the platform’s future through governance rights. In short, every transaction becomes a chance to earn and participate, not just buy. The numbers back up this interest. Web3Bay has raised over 2 million dollars in its presale with more than 400 million coins sold at the current Stage 5 price of $0.005247. The final presale stage is set at $0.1959, offering those who join early the chance for a return of up to 6,400%. Unlike projects that only talk about future utility, Web3Bay is already live with a working marketplace. Real Benefits, Daily Earnings, True Platform Access Cashback rewards are common in traditional banking and shopping platforms, often offering 1 to 2 percent in points or restricted bonuses. Web3Bay offers something different. It gives users real, usable digital rewards for each purchase. Here’s the process. Buyers using 3BAY instantly get a 5 percent discount. In addition, Web3Bay provides ongoing daily rewards, building a cycle that encourages regular use. These rewards can be used within the platform, traded, or saved. What makes this model stand out is the added layer of community participation. Those holding 3BAY also gain the ability to vote on platform updates and new features. It gives every buyer the chance to help shape how the marketplace grows. This mix of savings, daily rewards, and shared control turns 3BAY into more than just a purchase method. It becomes a key part of the platform’s structure. That is what gives it lasting value in the fast-moving world of crypto. Why Web3Bay Is Gaining Attention Fast Web3Bay is solving a simple but overlooked fact: people shop in every market condition, whether prices are rising or falling. E-commerce remains one of the most stable industries, and connecting it to blockchain creates a huge new opportunity. Web3Bay does not try to change how people shop. Instead, it makes shopping more rewarding and allows users to take part in building a growing marketplace. What separates Web3Bay from other presale projects is that its platform is already live. It is not just a plan for the future but a real marketplace in action. Built on blockchain, it uses smart contract-based escrow and decentralized file storage through IPFS. It also works smoothly with crypto wallets and regular payment methods like PayPal, Google Pay, and Apple Pay. Web3Bay blends the ease of Web2 with the ownership model of Web3. This design helps attract both crypto users and everyday shoppers. Newcomers can start easily, and experienced users stay in control of their transactions. The system is built to grow, and it rewards those who take part early rather than only big companies or outside backers. Why Web3Bay Could Lead in Utility-Driven Crypto More people in crypto are shifting from trading for quick profits to using platforms that offer real benefits. Web3Bay aims to be a leader in this move toward useful crypto commerce. Projects like Ethereum and Solana grew because people built valuable products on them. Web3Bay follows the same path by tying 3BAY’s use to real shopping, active participation, and community decision-making. Those joining the presale now are not only hoping for future value. They are already joining a working system where 3BAY has a clear purpose today. The total supply is limited to 5 billion coins, and only 40 percent is set aside for crypto presale participants. The fixed supply and growing activity are starting to create demand. Web3Bay is not chasing trends or trying to be another meme coin. It aims to change online retail. It gives users a way to spend less, earn rewards, and have a say in how the platform grows. As presale stages move forward and prices rise, early participants in 3BAY may see themselves holding more than just a coin. They could be holding a role in shaping the future of online commerce.

Bitcoin holds steady, Ethereum keeps expanding, and focus is now shifting toward the next wave of standout players. Among the coins attracting attention are Solana, XRP, and Cardano, each showing renewed price action, solid patterns, and interest from institutions. But it’s BlockDAG that’s emerging as a serious contender. With its presale figures and scalable design, BDAG is drawing attention for its future potential. In a market looking for the next big mover, BlockDAG has become a name worth watching. Whether you’re a market veteran or just starting out, 2025 could be shaped by new leaders, and these four coins are top contenders. Let’s explore what makes each of these projects one of the top cryptos to watch this year. BlockDAG: 2520% Gain Potential BlockDAG has captured major attention in 2025. The project has now raised over $240.5 million and sold more than 20.1 billion BDAG coins, making it one of the most successful presales this year. Batch 28 is priced at $0.0262 with the launch price set at $0.05, that’s a projected gain of 2,520%. But BlockDAG ’s appeal goes beyond price. It supports EVM-compatible smart contracts and delivers fast transaction speeds. The project is developer-friendly and has already completed its CertiK audit. There are also signs of upcoming listings and strong interest from key players. Adoption is growing fast. The X1 Miner App has crossed one million downloads, and over 17,440 miner devices have been sold, pushing total miner sales beyond $7 million. These figures show that BlockDAG has traction beyond just early buzz. If you’re scanning the market for top cryptos to watch, BDAG offers one of the few opportunities with both a strong foundation and major growth upside, if you act now. Solana: Ecosystem Expansion Keeps SOL in the Lead Solana continues to perform well in 2025, now trading around $175.15 after a 0.40% daily increase. Over the past month, it’s up 36%, boosted by high trading activity and renewed institutional attention. The $150 mark has become a reliable support level. Analysts say if the upward trend holds, Solana could move toward $164 – $200 in the coming weeks. The chain’s strong throughput, low fees, and growing user base make it one of the top cryptos to watch this year. From DeFi projects to NFT activity, the network is staying active. Solana’s steady development and expanding utility ensure it keeps its place as a key player in the market’s next phase. For those watching the space, SOL remains a project to track closely. XRP: Legal Progress and Whale Interest Drive Sentiment XRP is making headlines again, priced at $2.46 and up 3.67% in 24 hours. Its daily volume has jumped above $4.35 billion. A rise in whale wallet activity and progress in Ripple’s legal situation are pushing the narrative. Analysts see $6.30 as a possible target if a favorable legal outcome is confirmed. That would clear a path for wider adoption. XRP recently broke past key resistance, a positive sign amid broader uncertainty. As a project focused on cross-border payments, XRP has a real use case. The combination of legal clarity and growing interest makes it one of the top cryptos to watch. The next few months may define its long-term place in the market. Cardano: Closing in on Key Resistance Levels Cardano (ADA) is showing upward momentum, with a current price of $0.8314 after a 4.02% gain in a day. It’s nearing an important resistance zone between $0.70 and $0.80. A breakout here could point to a run toward $1, a strong technical and psychological level. A descending triangle breakout and increased whale wallet activity suggest growing interest. Market sentiment also supports ADA’s path upward. Cardano’s strong focus on academic research and sustainability makes it stand out in the race for scalable blockchain networks. It has earned its spot among the top cryptos to watch for 2025, especially as it hits new milestones. Final Thoughts: The 2025 Crypto Picture Is Taking Shape The next wave of crypto leaders is starting to emerge. Solana has momentum, XRP is benefiting from legal shifts, and Cardano continues to deliver consistent updates. Each holds promise in its own way. But BlockDAG may offer the most striking opportunity. With its current price of $0.0262 available in batch 28, and strong traction across miners and users, it’s a project with real breakout potential. As the market gears up for its next move, these names will likely dominate the conversation around top cryptos to watch in 2025. The post Missed Bitcoin?

Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are back in focus, with rising whale activity, technical patterns, and community chatter. While both tokens attract fresh interest, another name is quietly picking up pace. Dragoin ($DDGN) has entered Stage 4 of its presale and is offering more than just hype. It brings live gameplay, immediate rewards, and a 6,700 percent return that is already set within its price tiers. Below is a closer look at the latest Shiba Inu and Dogecoin movements and why Dragoin might offer something different in 2025. Shiba Inu Gains Attention After Fake Token Alert The Shiba Inu team has issued a warning about fake SHIB tokens being shared on various platforms. They clarified that these tokens are not connected to any official project within the ecosystem. Even though the warning was defensive, it brought more visibility to SHIB. The token name started trending online again, and the community responded by highlighting the legitimacy of the original project. Developer activity has also remained steady, with Shibarium continuing to expand as part of the long-term Layer 2 plans. However, SHIB’s price has not moved much. It remains in a sideways trend, with long-term supporters staying hopeful but short-term action still limited. Dogecoin Whale Moves Hint at Possible Upside Dogecoin has shown new bullish signals backed by data. Whale accumulation has been noted by analysts at TronWeekly, a pattern that has in the past led to major price moves. The Dogecoin Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently in a neutral zone, which could support further price increases without risk of being overbought. Resistance levels at $0.16661 and $0.18028 are now being watched closely. If DOGE can pass these marks, some analysts expect the rally to gain speed. DOGE is picking up momentum. Buying interest is rising. But for new buyers coming in now, any gains will depend on whether the broader market pushes it back to old highs. That’s where Dragoin offers a different angle. It has value baked in through its price model, and its tools are already live. Dragoin ($DDGN) Combines Playable Utility With Meme Appeal Dragoin is not following the usual meme coin formula seen with DOGE or SHIB. It is setting up a different approach, offering one of the most original models in the meme coin category. This project starts with a working game. Right now, users can enter a live Telegram-based play-to-earn game where they manage dragons, complete tasks, and earn leaderboard rewards. There is no extra app to install. Players simply log in and start earning by staying active. The presale model is designed to be easy to follow and capable of handling scale. Running through 25 price stages, Dragoin is currently in Stage 4, with tokens priced at $0.0000444. The launch price is already confirmed at $0.002. This gives a simple, upfront return calculation. Early participants are buying at a level that offers 6,700% potential returns at the time of launch. Community activity is also central to this project. From the beginning, Dragoin has made open access and involvement a priority. Events, bonuses, and airdrops are not just for attention. They are part of how the project creates value. The idea is simple: users join, earn, and help guide the direction. This is not a project asking people to wait. It encourages them to take part. The numbers behind Dragoin’s possible upside are clear. At Stage 4, $1,000 gives around 29.85 million tokens. At launch, if listed at $0.002, that holding could be worth $67,000. That is a 6,700% increase built into the early sale. This does not include possible gains from gameplay, bonus rewards, or price action after the token lists. Clear Supply Design and Decentralized Control Dragoin’s total token supply is fixed at 200 billion. Half of that supply is allocated to the presale, letting more buyers enter early at a lower cost. Another 30% will go toward growing the ecosystem through in-game rewards, future development, and staking support. The next 15% is for liquidity, helping trading stay stable after launch. The last 5% is reserved for the team but locked for two years, showing long-term interest and preventing early exits. A key decision in Dragoin’s design is that all unsold tokens from the crypto presale will be permanently burned. This instantly reduces the supply and may increase the value of what remains. In addition, the smart contract will be renounced at launch, taking all control away from the developers and making the project fully decentralized. These steps are not just features. They are built into the structure and show Dragoin’s focus on transparency and stability. A Closer Look at Three Meme Coins Comparing SHIB, DOGE, and Dragoin shows three very different types of projects. Shiba Inu is facing false token issues and building its ecosystem slowly. Dogecoin has some positive signs, but most interest depends on large holders and community reactions. Dragoin, on the other hand, already has a working game, real-time rewards, and a defined return path with a decentralized setup in motion. People who are holding SHIB or DOGE may feel they are making a stable choice. But higher returns rarely come with complete safety. If you are someone who missed early chances in DOGE or SHIB, Dragoin is now offering an entry that matches those earlier prices, but with added features and a working product. With Stage 4 still active, the lower prices are available now. Later stages may not give the same starting point.

In this article, we’ll break down the recent price action, what could happen next, and a long-term prediction for Cardano’s future. Cardano Breaks a New High After Months For the first time since December, Cardano’s price broke out of its downward trend. Recently, it reached as high as $0.86 before pulling back slightly. This move was important because it could mean a possible shift from a bearish (downward) market to a bullish (upward) trend. At the moment, Cardano has strong support levels around $0.77 to $0.72. There’s a chance the price could revisit these levels before starting another push higher. Can ADA Reach $2 or More This Bull Market? According to Investing Broz, by the end of summer, Cardano could aim for new highs between $1.70 and $2.40. But what about the top of this entire bull market? To figure that out, it’s important to consider a few important factors: how much ADA will be in circulation, how much of the total crypto market Cardano will control, and what the overall crypto market cap might be. When Will the Bull Market Peak? Predicting the exact timing of a bull market top is tough. Some believe it could follow the classic four-year cycle and peak around September or October 2025. However, recent trends suggest this cycle might not hold up anymore. The crypto market has changed, with big institutions playing a larger role now. Unlike retail investors, institutions often use market manipulation tactics, causing unexpected price movements. Because of this, the top of the bull market could come earlier or later than expected. A safe guess would be around mid-2026, when more institutional money might flow into the market. How Much ADA Will Be in Circulation? Right now, there are about 35.3 billion ADA tokens in circulation. By the summer of 2026, this number is expected to rise to around 36.5 billion. This gradual increase will slightly affect the price as more tokens become available. How Much of the Crypto Market Will Cardano Control? At the moment, Cardano holds about 0.88% of the total crypto market. In previous bull markets, its dominance was higher. However, with more competition in the market today, it’s unlikely to reclaim those old levels. A reasonable expectation for Cardano’s dominance would be between 2% and 4% by the peak of the bull market. While some believe it could go higher, the growing number of altcoins makes this range a realistic target. Cardano’s Possible Market Cap and Price If the total crypto market reaches $11 trillion and Cardano holds between 2% and 4% dominance, its market cap could range from $220 billion to $440 billion. Based on these market cap numbers and the expected 36.5 billion ADA tokens in circulation, Cardano’s price could land between $6 and $12 during the peak of the bull market. In a very bullish scenario, where the total market reaches $22 trillion, Cardano’s market cap could climb as high as $880 billion.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-14 03:03:24

Here’s Why Lightchain AI Could Be Your Next Big Win,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/is-the-bear-market-crushing-portfolios-heres-why-lightchain-ai-could-be-your-next-big-win/,"In a market that has been dominated by the bears, Lightchain AI is offering investors a path of escape. Its presale has hit $20.2 million, with tokens selling at $0.007, making the project one of the best ways for investors to turn their fortunes around in this market cycle. While many coins have been battling the bears, Lightchain AI continues its impressive rise, thanks to its great vision and practical value. As the wider market continues to drop, those looking for hedges are turning to projects that have a real staying power, making Lightchain AI one of the most promising in that aspect. Why Is Bear Market Devastating Crypto Portfolios? The ongoing crypto winter has been hurting portfolios, with the effect worsened by macroeconomic and sector factors. Rising interest rates and other monetary policies have also removed liquidity in the system, leading to investors leaving riskier classes of assets like cryptocurrencies. In addition, projects like FTX have also reduced investor confidence, leading to sharp selloffs. Moreover, there has been increased regulatory attention and enforcement, leading to an increase in the uncertainty in the market, causing investors to be cautious. Also, fast money movements, which is down to the quick inflows and outflows of money (primarily institutional investors via ETFs) have caused volatility in the market. These factors combined and caused the market to witness a downturn, showing the importance of risk management practices and diversification of assets in the crypto industry. Nevertheless, there is always a ray of hope that shines in these times. As short-term traders attempt to make their way during these volatile periods, it has provided an opportunity for long-term investors to increase their portfolios. One of the projects that can be used to achieve this is Lightchain AI, a project that is worth being invested in. Why Lightchain AI is Poised for Significant Growth Unlike speculative meme coins or projects that depend on hype, Lightchain AI stands out in the crypto industry, addressing the major challenges in the blockchain and AI industry and providing real value. One of its most impressive features is its cryptographic verification system, which ensures that only legitimate updates are added to the blockchain. This ensures that users can feel secure and trust the network, showing that the project is focused on real change rather than empty promises. Lightchain AI is a project that promises real application and has a strong growth potential. Another highlight is its Memecoin Launchpad, which was designed to help creators and developers. It has different AI-powered tools that help creators bring their ideas to life, ensuring that they earn well. It is all about improving creativity and aiding the development of the new generation of blockchain ecosystems. Why Lightchain AI is Turning Heads, Even in Bear Market The crypto industry might be facing its challenges, Lightchain AI is still drawing attention, and it’s for the right reasons. The AI industry is on the rise, and the project is leading that charge in combining AI and blockchain technology. Even in tough market conditions, the project still raised $20.2 million in its presale. That kind of confidence from investors is not just luck, it is a sign that Lightchain AI is ready for something big as the market prepares to bounce back. What really sets Lightchain AI apart? It provides investors with the perfect time to het into the project. With tokens still selling for $0.007, this is the perfect opportunity for investors to enter, positioning themselves for profits when the token starts to rise after the launch. As crypto begins to recover, Lightchain AI stands out as a project that wants to change things. It has a bold vision and a rising demand that make it more than just the next project, making it an investment that has real promise. Opportunities like this are hard to find, so it might be the best opportunity to take a look at the project. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf Tweets by LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",Press Release,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-14 03:11:52

As furore about U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs rages on, one age-old reality remains constant for the Japanese: gold is valuable. Regional media in Japan reports that gold is being adopted more and more as a safe haven against looming economic threats.Kyodo News recently detailed that Japanese investors are turning to the shiny yellow metal via the government’s controversial new NISA (Nippon Individual Savings Account), as well as through solid, direct investment. Japan residents take shelter in gold via NISA, direct investment NISA’s tax-exemption schemes for private investors afford individuals the ability to invest in products linked to gold’s price movements, but direct investments are also reportedly on the rise.Tanaka Precious Metal Technologies, Co. notes of the inter-dealer price (translated): “[The] price was also boosted by reports that US President Trump was considering firing Fed Chairman Powell, reaching a monthly high of 15,561 yen on the 22nd. After that, US President Trump denied the idea of ​​firing the Fed Chairman, and selling prevailed due to expectations of an easing of US-China trade friction, and the month ended at 15,198 yen.” JPY-denominated Tanaka Precious Metals retail bullion price. Source: Tanaka . Notably, gold tapped an all-time JPY price high per gram on April 22, and again on May 8, according to the asset bullion retail rate set by Tanaka. The tax-excluded, inter-dealer reference price (mentioned above) similarly tapped a high on the 22nd, but has since cooled off.The Kyodo News report notes that concerns about global economic downturn and Donald Trump’s trade war have Tokyoites and residents of Japan not only buying up bullion and coins, but also “investing in pure gold at fixed monthly values” via Tanaka Precious Metals, which investments reportedly grew 26% as compared to the January-April period from a year ago.Further, Komehyo Co., a major secondhand luxury brand retailer, says gold product sales (including accessories) climbed 30% year-on-year as of March 2025.Investments such as the Mitsubishi UFJ fine gold fund (tied to gold’s price), have also seen growth, with inflows of “19.2 billion yen in March, up by about 2.6-fold from last December,” according to Kyodo. Japan’s political and economic strife a major factor Even before fear of Trump’s stifling of international exchange, Japan has been struggling with multiple issues, most of which have been the direct result of dysfunctional government policy. These issues include lack of adequate pensions for the elderly, skyrocketing inflation, rice prices at all-time highs , destructive inbound tourism, a new self-described “defense geek” prime minister with a strikingly low approval rating.Given the turmoil, people seem to be turning to gold in an ages old strategy designed to protect themselves from such problems. To many residents of the archipelago, Japan’s PM seems more interested in pouring JPY into the U.S. state , than helping fix the problems at hand.

The memo says revenue in the fiscal year that starts in July will fall 4% from the state’s earlier forecast. Staff members link the slide to a stock sell‑off that hit Wall Street after Trump set out a wide tariff push on April 2. The officials broke down the projected loss this way: about $10 billion less from capital‑gains taxes, $2.5 billion less from corporate taxes, and roughly $3.5 billion less from personal‑income taxes tied to wages and business profits. “Trump’s tariff policies weakened the national and state outlook and caused equity losses,” the memo says. Officials add that these factors began to drag on California receipts in 2025 and erased the strong cash flow the state had seen earlier in the year. Even so, revenue for the fiscal year that ends in June still stands $6.8 billion above Newsom’s last estimate. On the same day the memo came out, a rally led by technology firms pushed U.S. stocks into positive territory for the year. Washington and Beijing said on Monday they will temporarily lower duties on each other’s goods, another sign that could boost investor mood. Newsom calls the gap “Trump Slump” Politico first reported on the memo, which lands one day before the governor is due to unveil his new budget proposal for the coming fiscal year. California’s budget is dependent on the richest households. The top 1% of earners pay nearly half of all personal‑income tax, and much of that money hinges on capital‑gains income that follows the stock market. The new hit to the treasury comes on top of $27.3 billion in financial remedies. It includes $16.1 billion in cuts and a $7.1 billion removal from the state’s rainy‑day fund. California’s constitution requires a balanced budget each year, which means that any shortfall must be closed. Hence, this will be the third year in a row that Newsom and lawmakers trim spending after earlier budgets allocated more money than the state can spend on various programs. Trump’s April tariff order placed duties on all imported goods, raised taxes on items from Mexico, Canada and China, and set extra levies on products such as cars and aluminum. While the president has since eased some of those tariffs, Newsom argues that the policy and the uncertainty around it will raise unemployment and inflation, lower gross domestic product and shrink capital‑gains revenue for California. Last month California sued Trump, saying that he lacks the authority to impose tariffs all on his own. On Tuesday, state attorneys said they will ask a federal judge for a preliminary injunction that would freeze the tariffs while the case moves forward.

This surge comes as tariff tensions between China and the United States ease off, and macroeconomic conditions become positive again. According to a report from the crypto exchange Bitfinex, favorable macroeconomic conditions and significant institutional demand can keep BTC on a positive trajectory in the meantime. Analysts said that with macro catalysts returning to the forefront, BTC will continue to display relative strength compared with equities and other risk assets. Bitcoin Reclaims $100K One development driving the confidence that has returned to the market is the Federal Reserve’s positive comments on the rate trajectory around the U.S. tariff situation. The comments’ positivity has created a backdrop that has strengthened bitcoin’s recovery and set the stage for a renewed push to new ATHs. Per Bitfinex analysts, China has paused retaliatory tariffs against the U.S., following “backchannel progress” between both countries. The market now faces reduced geopolitical tail risk and ongoing fiscal support, and with rate cuts still on the table, risk assets, led by BTC, could perform well. Bitcoin’s resurgence has triggered a fresh wave of capital inflows, reviving market liquidity and participation. Some investors are re-entering the market, while others are de-risking and taking profits. Bitfinex said the renewed capital inflow is evident in the realized cap. This metric measures the aggregate cost basis of all coins in circulation and tells how much capital enters the market over time. Bitcoin’s realized cap has hit an ATH of $889 billion, rising by 2.1% in the past 30 days. This indicates a sharp uptick in net inflows, reinforcing analysts’ belief that bitcoin’s recent gains are driven by fresh liquidity and not speculative rotation. While BTC hovered below the $75,000 range, more than 5 million coins were at an unrealized loss; however, the price recovery has reduced that number to 0.7 million. Institutional Demand Becomes Steady In addition to bitcoin’s realized cap hitting a new ATH, U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have recorded massive inflows in the last two weeks. Inflow patterns observed by analysts suggest that ETF flows are becoming de-correlated from short-term pullbacks. The demand signals steady allocation from market participants, not opportunistic buying, driven by portfolio mandates, not retail speculation.

33767162,[object Object],1747195237,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Crypto Gets A New Watchdog Map: SEC Chief Atkins Lays Down The Law,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-gets-a-new-watchdog-map-sec-chief-atkins-lays-down-the-law/,"A top US regulator laid out a clear push for change yesterday, saying that moving stocks and bonds onto crypto and blockchains could open the door to new ways of buying, selling and owning shares. The official – new US Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Paul Atkins – spoke at a Washington roundtable on tokenization, drawing a simple parallel to how music shifted from vinyl to digital files. He warned that sticking with old rules could push innovation offshore and vowed to work with his fellow commissioners to set fresh guidelines. Issuance Guidelines Under Scrutiny According to Atkins, only four crypto issuers have used the SEC’s full registration or “Regulation A” since these tokens first appeared. That small number, he said, shows that current forms—like the long Form S-1—can feel like “a square peg in a round hole.” He suggested carving out clear paths , including new exemptions or safe harbors, so token offerings can meet basic disclosure needs without pages of irrelevant details. Rethinking Custody Rules Based on reports, the SEC has already scrapped Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121, which had tangled up firms wanting to hold digital assets. The speaker called that move just the first step. He urged a fresh look at who can act as a “qualified custodian,” noting that some funds and advisers now use self-custody tools that may offer strong safeguards. Only two “special purpose broker-dealers” exist today, and he hinted that their narrow rules might be replaced with a more sensible model. Trading Platforms Get New Focus Atkins said it’s time to let brokers build “super apps” where customers can trade stocks, crypto and other products in a single place. He pointed out that nothing in current law bars broker-dealers from listing non-security tokens alongside shares. To make that happen, he’s asking staff to update the rules for alternative trading systems, and to weigh whether national exchanges might host token listings in the future. Task Force Drives Coordination Atkins also highlighted a newly formed Crypto Task Force led by two fellow commissioners. He said this group fixes years of agency silos by pooling policy, legal and technical teams. Coordination, he added, will speed up clear signals for investors and businesses. That effort, he noted, follows a call from US President Donald Trump to make the US “ crypto capital of the planet.” The regulator underlined three main areas—issuance, custody and trading—and said each needs tailored rules. He argued that fresh standards will protect investors by spelling out what counts as a security, how tokens must be held, and where they can trade. He also promised to keep enforcement focused on fraud and manipulation, rather than using enforcement actions to shape policy.

However, various analysts forecast potential volatility for the King of Altcoins, as it faces some resistance at the current levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces Key Resistance After 10% Weekly Rally – Confirmation Or Rejection Next? Ethereum To Trade Sideways Before Next Jump After surging nearly 45% in the past week, Ethereum has reclaimed its $2,200-$3,900 macro range lost in March. During the late-April market pump, the cryptocurrency recovered from its 18-month low of $1,380, jumping toward the $1,800 resistance before breaking out last Thursday. ETH has smashed past the $2,000 resistance and regained the crucial $2,100 and $2,300 levels before retesting the $2,600 resistance over the weekend. Since then, the King of Altcoins has hovered between the $2,400-$2,600 price range, hitting a two-month high of $2,624 on Monday. Market watcher Castillo Trading highlighted that Ethereum is “doing exactly what it should be. Taking some time to build a base at important levels before the next move.” The analyst stated that the $2,400-$2,700 zone will likely be ETH’s trading range for the upcoming days after its retest of the range lows as support, with “some shakeouts in both directions before continuing its next leg up.” Similarly, Daan Crypto Trades noted that the cryptocurrency’s current level is important, as it could determine its short-term direction. According to the trader, Ethereum could drop to $2,300 or below the $2,100 support level if it loses the key area. “In that case, you can simply wait for a consolidation to be formed at those levels,” he explained. On the contrary, if ETH breaks past the $2,600 resistance, and price keeps surging, the current level may “become a nice retest of the horizontal.” Notably, the next crucial horizontal level sits around the $2,850-$2,900 range, a significant support and resistance area amid the Q3 2024 pullback and the Q4 2024 breakout. Is A Dip Or A 15% Shakeout Coming? Analyst Rekt Capital pointed out that Ethereum secured a key Weekly Close after closing the week at $2,514 and officially reclaiming its Macro Range. According to the analyst, history suggests that ETH will “likely lift across the Range” over time, while “any dips, if needed at all, would only solidify $2200 as Range Low support.” He stressed that the recent Weekly Close occurred at the top of a crucial cluster, enabling a scenario where “just a small dip would suffice, if the green circled retest repeats here at ~$2468 (black).” However, if that level is lost, ETH could see a 10%-15% pullback toward the $2,200-$2,100 mark. Rekt Capital also remarked that the second-largest crypto by market capitalization has managed to fill the $2,530-$2,630 Daily CME Gap, created in March. Related Reading: Why The US-China 90-Day Tariff Slash Can Push Bitcoin Price Above $110,000 Amid its breakout, ETH also formed two small CME Gaps at the $2,300-$2,400 and $2,100-$2,200 levels, which could be closed soon. The former is the “more important dipping area, as it is also a Weekly CME Gap.” Additionally, he affirmed that Ethereum intends to fill its Macro CME Gap, between $2,900 and $3,350, signaling that a surge toward those levels could be ahead. As of this writing, Ethereum trades at $2,597, a 5% increase in the daily timeframe.

This 20% one-week rise places it ahead of the broader cryptocurrency market, which has seen a 13% uptick over the same period. The surge in price has been matched by a sharp increase in derivatives activity. In just one week, futures open interest for XRP ( XRP ) has increased from $2.42 billion to $3.42 billion, according to a May 13 post on X from Glassnode.

Other important indicators, like the moving average convergence divergence, point to continued upward movement. Alongside chart strength, institutional demand appears to be growing. The XXRP ETF, which provides institutional investors with exposure to XRP, has seen inflows for five weeks in a row. The fund brought in $14 million last week, up from $10 million the previous week, according to data from etf.com. The fund’s total assets under management now amount to over $99 million. This is notable considering that its 1.89% annual management fee is almost twice as high as some of the more well-known Bitcoin ( BTC ) ETFs. Despite this, investor interest is still high, suggesting that there is a greater demand for products linked to XRP. This rise in demand coincides with mounting speculation that spot XRP ETFs will soon be approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Platforms like Polymarket now show that the odds of approval are 80%. According to JPMorgan analysts, XRP ETF inflows could reach $8 billion in the first year, surpassing Ethereum ( ETH ) ETF inflows since their approval in September 2024. Because of its strong technical structure, growing institutional interest, and rising open interest, XRP looks ready for a significant breakout if the current trends continue.
