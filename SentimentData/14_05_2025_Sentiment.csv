South Korea’s Financial Post reported that the Democratic Party, the National Assembly’s biggest party, is currently “considering” issuing a manifesto promise to ditch existing fiat on/off banking rules. Crypto Exchange Deregulation Now Inevitable, Sources Claim The current banking rules require domestic fiat-trading crypto exchanges to partner with a bank that must provide platforms with customer banking services via dedicated crypto wallet -linked bank accounts. Upbit trading volumes over the past 12 months. (Source: CoinGecko) In late April, the ruling People Power Party (PPP) unveiled a host of crypto promises, including a pledge to do away with the rule . If the DP does indeed follow suit, this could mean the end of the era of exclusive banking deals. Instead, exchanges would be free to strike deals with multiple banks. And that could potentially spell trouble for K Bank, whose partnership with the market-leading exchange Upbit has led to exponential growth for both parties. However, the media outlet wrote that the banking sector is now set to “undergo surgery” as “voices urging deregulation grow louder ahead of the presidential election.” Frontrunner Mulls Manifesto Pledge The media outlet claimed that the campaign team of the DP candidate and presidential frontrunner Lee Jae-myung is “strongly considering” making a near-identical pledge. That would all result in K Bank “taking a direct hit,” the outlet continued. Critics have previously claimed that K Bank’s “dependence” on its Upbit-related business could derail its long-running bid to go public. K Bank has been Upbit’s exclusive banking partner since mid-2020. Trades on Upbit account for almost 68% of the current total of the domestic South Korean market.

Regulators are also hinting that they could be prepared to soften their hardline stance on the crypto sector. The same media outlet wrote that the Financial Services Commission (FSC) is now “looking into conditional deregulation measures.” The FSC Chairman Kim Byung-hwan told reporters at a recent press conference: “Since the existing banking rules were introduced to reduce the risk of money laundering, we will need to check to see if banks and exchanges have the systems in place that let them manage all related risks. We will conduct a comprehensive review. And after that, we will decide whether or not we need to improve the current system.” An unnamed financial industry executive told the media outlet: “Since there are so many voices calling for deregulation, we will have no choice but to go in that direction. But we need to gradually ease regulations, while ensuring we make up for any shortcomings.” The post South Korean Crypto Exchange Deregulation Plans Set to Rock Banking Sector appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|Crypto Exchange|South Korea,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-05-13 23:30:00

Insider trading cases, like with $MELANIA, expose the high-risk, high-reward nature of meme-driven markets. Meme coins, once dismissed as fleeting internet jokes, are now outperforming traditional tech-focused cryptocurrencies in 2025. According to crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa, meme coins like Pepe, Bonk, Dogwifhat (WIF), Fartcoin, and Floki are demonstrating greater resilience and investor interest compared to many ‘tech’ altcoins. Sherpa suggests that the enduring appeal of these culturally resonant tokens may give them a longevity that tech-centric coins lack. He said : “There are 10,000 coins and none of them can sustain attention forever. It’s actually why I suspect the bigger, Lindy memes will have better staying power than in the past.

A significant move from within the ranks of a global banking giant signals the continued, perhaps accelerating, shift of top-tier talent towards the crypto space. Andrew Peel, who previously led digital asset markets at Morgan Stanley, has made the leap to establish his own venture in Switzerland, specifically focusing on building bridges between the old and new financial worlds. This departure from Morgan Stanley crypto operations highlights a growing trend: experienced professionals from established financial institutions are increasingly seeing opportunities to innovate and build within the decentralized ecosystem. Andrew Peel’s Bold Leap: From Morgan Stanley Crypto to a Swiss Crypto Investment Firm Andrew Peel’s decision to leave his prominent role at Morgan Stanley is more than just a career change; it’s a statement about where he sees the future of finance heading. His new company, based in the crypto-friendly hub of Zug, Switzerland, is reportedly focused on key areas poised for significant growth: tokenized funds and trading tools designed to connect traditional finance infrastructure with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. This focus on a crypto investment firm structure suggests an intent to not just observe but actively participate in and shape the institutional adoption of digital assets. Peel’s background at a major institution like Morgan Stanley gives him unique insights into the needs, challenges, and opportunities for bringing large-scale capital and complex financial products into the digital asset space. His move underscores the increasing viability and attractiveness of the crypto sector as a place for seasoned finance professionals to build innovative businesses. Building the Essential TradFi DeFi Bridge One of the most exciting, and perhaps necessary, developments for widespread institutional adoption of digital assets is the creation of robust and secure connections between TradFi and DeFi. Peel’s new firm aims squarely at this challenge, focusing on tools that facilitate a seamless TradFi DeFi bridge . What does this bridge entail? Interoperability: Allowing assets and data to flow securely and efficiently between traditional financial systems (like banks, brokers, exchanges) and decentralized networks (like Ethereum, Solana, etc.). Compliance Layers: Integrating necessary regulatory and compliance frameworks (KYC/AML) into decentralized applications and processes to meet institutional requirements. Product Innovation: Creating new financial products, such as tokenized versions of traditional assets or regulated access points to DeFi yield strategies. Infrastructure Development: Building the underlying technology and protocols that support these interactions, ensuring security, scalability, and reliability. This bridging work is crucial because while DeFi offers innovation, efficiency, and transparency, TradFi provides scale, regulatory clarity (in its own domain), and established investor trust. A successful TradFi DeFi bridge can unlock immense liquidity and bring new levels of efficiency to global markets. The Promise and Potential of Tokenized Assets A core focus for Peel’s new venture is tokenized assets . This concept involves representing ownership or rights to real-world assets (like real estate, stocks, bonds, commodities, art, or even intellectual property) as digital tokens on a blockchain. Why is this significant? Increased Liquidity: Traditionally illiquid assets can be fractionalized and traded more easily on digital markets. Improved Efficiency: Transactions can be faster and cheaper by removing intermediaries and automating processes via smart contracts. Greater Accessibility: Fractional ownership allows smaller investors to access high-value assets previously out of reach. Enhanced Transparency: Ownership history and transactions are recorded on a public or permissioned ledger, increasing trust and auditability. Automated Management: Corporate actions, dividend distribution, or royalty payments can potentially be automated using smart contracts. Imagine owning a token representing a share in a piece of prime real estate, or trading tokens backed by a portfolio of corporate bonds. Tokenized assets have the potential to revolutionize capital markets, making them more democratic, efficient, and global. Peel’s focus suggests a belief that institutions will increasingly leverage this technology for asset management and trading. Zug, Switzerland: A Premier Hub for Institutional Crypto Firms The choice of Zug, Switzerland, as the base for Peel’s new company is no accident. Known globally as “Crypto Valley,” Zug has cultivated a reputation as a leading jurisdiction for blockchain and crypto companies. Its attractiveness stems from several factors: Progressive Regulation: Switzerland has taken a proactive and clear approach to regulating blockchain and digital assets, providing legal certainty for businesses operating in the space. Supportive Ecosystem: The region boasts a concentration of blockchain startups, service providers, academic institutions, and government support, fostering innovation and collaboration. Talent Pool: A growing number of skilled professionals with expertise in both finance and technology are based in or attracted to the area. Global Connectivity: Switzerland’s position in Europe and its reputation as a financial center make it an ideal location for a globally focused crypto investment firm . Establishing a firm in Zug positions it within a respected and well-regulated environment, which is crucial for attracting institutional clients and partners looking for compliance and stability in the volatile crypto market. The Accelerating Trend of Institutional Crypto Adoption Andrew Peel’s move is part of a larger, undeniable trend: the increasing involvement of large financial institutions in the crypto space. While initial institutional interest was cautious, focusing primarily on Bitcoin custody or futures, it has rapidly expanded. Today, we see institutions exploring: Direct investments in cryptocurrencies and digital asset funds. Offering crypto trading and brokerage services to clients. Developing blockchain infrastructure for internal processes. Exploring tokenization for various asset classes. Engaging with DeFi protocols for yield generation or lending (albeit often through regulated intermediaries). This growing institutional crypto adoption is driven by several factors, including client demand, the potential for new revenue streams, diversification benefits, and the recognition of blockchain technology’s long-term potential to reshape financial markets. The movement of senior executives like Peel from firms like Morgan Stanley to build native crypto businesses is a strong indicator of the industry’s maturation and future direction. What Does This Institutional Shift Mean for the Market? The influx of institutional players brings both opportunities and challenges. On the one hand, it can lead to increased liquidity, greater market efficiency, enhanced credibility for the asset class, and significant capital inflow. On the other hand, it may also bring increased regulatory scrutiny and potentially centralize aspects of a historically decentralized market. Challenges and Opportunities in Bridging TradFi and DeFi While the potential of a TradFi DeFi bridge is vast, significant hurdles remain. Regulatory clarity is still evolving across different jurisdictions, creating uncertainty. Interoperability between disparate blockchain networks and legacy TradFi systems is technically complex. Security risks associated with smart contracts and digital asset custody require sophisticated solutions. Despite these challenges, the opportunities for innovation in creating new financial products, improving market infrastructure, and expanding access to capital are immense. Firms like the one Peel is launching are at the forefront of tackling these issues. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Evolving Landscape For investors, builders, and participants in both TradFi and DeFi, Andrew Peel’s move and the broader trend of institutional crypto adoption offer key takeaways: Stay Informed: The convergence of TradFi and DeFi is a complex and fast-moving area. Understanding the technical, regulatory, and market developments is crucial. Evaluate New Products: Keep an eye on regulated offerings related to tokenized assets and institutional access to DeFi yield, but exercise due diligence. Understand the Infrastructure: Pay attention to the development of the TradFi DeFi bridge technology, as this infrastructure will underpin future market growth. Recognize Talent Flow: The migration of top TradFi talent into crypto is a bullish signal for the industry’s potential and increasing sophistication. Consider Regulatory Trends: Regulatory developments, particularly in jurisdictions like Switzerland, will significantly impact how institutions engage with digital assets. This period represents a critical phase in the evolution of global finance, where the strengths of traditional systems are being integrated with the innovation of decentralized technology. Conclusion: A New Era for Institutional Digital Assets Andrew Peel’s departure from Morgan Stanley to launch a crypto investment firm in Switzerland focused on tokenized assets and the TradFi DeFi bridge is a powerful symbol of the ongoing institutional embrace of digital assets. It signifies not just interest, but a commitment from experienced finance professionals to build the necessary infrastructure and products for a future where traditional and decentralized finance are seamlessly connected. As more talent flows from Wall Street to “Crypto Valley” and other digital asset hubs, the foundations for widespread institutional crypto adoption are being laid, promising a transformed financial landscape.

A significant event just unfolded on one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, Coinbase, sending ripples through the Crypto Market . We’re talking about a massive withdrawal of Bitcoin , the kind that often signals big moves from big players. What Does a Massive BTC Outflow From Coinbase Mean? According to insights shared by André Dragosch, head of research at Bitwise, on the social platform X, Coinbase Exchange recently witnessed its largest BTC Outflow of 2025. A staggering 9,739 BTC was withdrawn from the platform. But why is an outflow significant? Unlike inflows (deposits), outflows suggest that users are moving their Bitcoin off the exchange, typically into private wallets or cold storage. This action is often interpreted as a sign that the holders intend to keep their Bitcoin for the long term, rather than selling it in the immediate future. Think of an exchange like a marketplace. When goods are taken off the shelves and stored away, it usually means the owner isn’t planning to sell them right away. In the context of Bitcoin , a large outflow reduces the immediate selling pressure on the exchange. Is Growing Institutional Demand Behind This Move? The prevailing sentiment, echoed by Dragosch and many market analysts, is that this particular outflow is a strong indicator of accelerating Institutional Demand . Institutions, such as asset managers, hedge funds, and corporations, typically handle vast amounts of capital. When they acquire Bitcoin , they often prefer to take custody of it themselves or use dedicated institutional-grade custodians rather than leaving large sums on exchange hot wallets, which can be perceived as higher risk. Here are a few reasons why institutions might move large amounts of Bitcoin off exchanges: Security: Holding keys in cold storage or with a trusted custodian is generally considered more secure against exchange hacks or failures. Long-Term Strategy: Institutions buying for long-term investment or HODLing strategies have no immediate need to keep assets on an exchange for trading. Regulatory Compliance: Some institutional mandates or regulatory requirements might necessitate specific custody solutions. Fund Operations: Entities like spot Bitcoin ETFs require custodians to hold the underlying BTC that backs the fund shares. The sheer size of the 9,739 BTC withdrawal from Coinbase in 2025 suggests it wasn’t a single retail investor making the move. This scale points towards a large entity or multiple large entities accumulating Bitcoin and securing their holdings. How Does Increased Institutional Demand Impact the Crypto Market? The growing presence and Institutional Demand for Bitcoin have several potential impacts on the broader Crypto Market : Benefits: Increased Capital Inflow: Institutions bring significant capital, potentially driving up demand and price. Market Maturation: Institutional participation can lead to more sophisticated market infrastructure, regulation, and legitimacy. Reduced Volatility (Potentially): Long-term institutional holders are less likely to engage in frequent trading, potentially reducing short-term price swings compared to speculative retail trading. Validation: Institutional adoption serves as a strong validation of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class, attracting further interest. Challenges: Centralization Concerns: Large holdings by a few entities could raise concerns about market manipulation, although Bitcoin ‘s decentralized nature mitigates this significantly. Market Influence: Large institutional trades can still cause significant short-term price movements. Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased institutional involvement often brings greater regulatory attention, which can be a double-edged sword. This specific BTC Outflow from Coinbase is a tangible example of the trends analysts have been discussing – that institutional players are increasingly active in accumulating Bitcoin . Coinbase’s Role in Institutional Bitcoin Adoption Coinbase has positioned itself as a key gateway for institutions entering the crypto space. Its Coinbase Prime service offers tailored solutions for institutional clients, including trading, custody, and prime brokerage services. This makes Coinbase a natural venue for large institutional purchases and subsequent withdrawals for self-custody or transfer to institutional custodians. The fact that the largest BTC Outflow of 2025 occurred on Coinbase underscores its importance as a platform for institutional activity in the Crypto Market . Actionable Insights for Investors What does this surge in Institutional Demand and large BTC Outflow mean for the average investor? Confirmation of Trend: This event reinforces the narrative that Bitcoin is gaining traction as a legitimate asset class among sophisticated investors. Potential Price Impact: Sustained institutional buying pressure, coupled with reduced supply on exchanges due to outflows, could be bullish for Bitcoin ‘s price in the long term. Consider Long-Term View: Seeing institutions accumulate for the long haul might encourage retail investors to also consider a long-term investment strategy rather than short-term trading. Importance of Self-Custody: The institutional preference for moving BTC off-exchange highlights the importance of self-custody for larger holdings, a practice retail investors can also adopt using hardware wallets. While one large outflow event doesn’t guarantee future price movements, it provides concrete evidence of the increasing sophistication and scale of participation in the Bitcoin market. Event Amount Exchange Significance Largest BTC Outflow (2025 YTD) 9,739 BTC Coinbase Signals strong Institutional Demand In Conclusion: A Bullish Signal? The massive 9,739 Bitcoin outflow from Coinbase, the largest recorded in 2025 so far, is more than just a statistic; it’s a powerful signal. It points towards accelerating Institutional Demand for Bitcoin , with large players actively accumulating and securing their holdings off-exchange. This trend is a significant factor shaping the Crypto Market , potentially driving future growth and validating Bitcoin ‘s role as a store of value and a strategic asset. As institutions continue to enter the space, events like this BTC Outflow from major platforms like Coinbase will likely become more frequent, underscoring the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency investment.

In the latest State of Crypto report, the firm noted that Solana outperformed Coinbase and Ethereum in transaction volume in the first two months of 2025. According to the report , Solana processed $364.34 billion in transaction volume in January and February 2025, enough to put it ahead of Coinbase and Ethereum. Only Nasdaq, with $647.36 billion, was ahead of the network. Solana had $364.34 million in transaction volume for the first two months of 2025 (Source: 21 Shares) This has led to a comparison between the two, with experts saying Solana could become Nasdaq onchain. The report stated: “Solana is now the most-used network in the world, boasting over 100M monthly active users. At its peak in January and February 2025, Solana processed $364B in volume-more than half of Nasdaq’s exchange volume.” 21 Shares analysts added that this performance aligns with the network growth trajectory since emerging from the ashes of FTX collapse. Since then, the network has seen a surge in almost all metrics, with capital deployed soaring more than 2,000% to almost $7 billion, while its native token SOL peaked at $263 earlier this year. Interestingly, stablecoin activity on the network has also increased substantially, growing 600% in the last 12 months from $2.16 billion to over $12 billion. What is driving Solana’s growth Meanwhile, the report focused extensively on the factors driving Solana’s growth over the past two years, noting that its infrastructure, transaction speed, and low fees are among the reasons. In comparison with other networks, Solana’s average block time of 0.44 seconds is only bested by Sui, with 0.21 seconds among the major smart contract networks. The blockchain can also handle up to 65,000 transactions per second and has an average transaction fee of only $0.03 However, the reason for the network’s growth extends beyond its infrastructural capacity, given that emerging networks such as Sui can rival it in this area. Its success is also a testament to its user experience and focus on partnerships. The report stated that Solana’s strategic partnerships with enterprises are also crucial to its performance. These partnerships with PayPal, First Digital, Visa, Stripe, and Shopify mean millions of users rely on the network settlement capacities. It said: “Solana’s technical supremacy and enterprise partnerships cement its role as the backbone of next-gen payment systems and retail-focused blockchain adoption.” Additionally, the report noted that more developers are building on Solana, pointing to the 83% growth in its developer base last year. This marks the first time another network will beat Ethereum in new developer growth. With developers building on Solana, the network has seen an influx of new products in all categories, such as decentralized finance (DeFi), decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN), AI, and memecoins. The report particularly highlighted memecoins as a growth catalyst and ultimate stress test for the network. What is next for the SOL price? Meanwhile, 21 Shares analysts believe that SOL might be undervalued, with its fair value between $520 and $1,800, depending on the growth rate. This estimate is based on a discounted cash flow model. It said: “Though based on TradFi valuation principles, which may not fully translate to crypto, this approach underscores Solana’s intrinsic value through real revenue generation.” With these estimates, the firm believes that SOL value could grow significantly, especially as it attracts more activity and increases on-chain activity. However, Solana is not expected to flip Ethereum in the market cap anytime soon, even if its growth trajectory impacts Ethereum’s dominance. At the time of the report in late April, SOL was trading at $152.72, and its market cap was around 34% of Ethereum’s. Since then, both assets have seen substantial growth in value, with SOL now worth $182.51 while ETH has increased by 50% in the past seven days to $2,692.

44587610,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=160053,1747180241,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,BitGo Partnership Seals Upexi’s Bold Crypto Custody & Solana Strategy,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitgo-upexi-crypto-custody/,"In a significant move highlighting the increasing convergence of traditional business and the digital asset world, cryptocurrency custody firm BitGo has inked a strategic deal with e-commerce company Upexi . This partnership is set to provide essential crypto custody and over-the-counter (OTC) trading services, supporting Upexi’s recently announced focus on cryptocurrency asset management. What Does This Partnership Mean for Upexi and BitGo? The core of this collaboration centers on BitGo providing its institutional-grade digital asset services to Upexi . For Upexi , an e-commerce company known for acquiring and scaling Amazon and Shopify brands, this marks a clear strategic pivot into the cryptocurrency space. By leveraging BitGo’s robust infrastructure, Upexi aims to securely manage its growing digital asset portfolio. Key aspects of the partnership include: Secure Custody: BitGo will provide secure storage solutions for Upexi’s digital assets, mitigating risks associated with holding large amounts of cryptocurrency. OTC Trading Access: Upexi gains access to BitGo’s OTC trading services, allowing for large-volume trades to be executed efficiently and with minimal market impact, crucial for managing significant positions. Foundation for Growth: The partnership provides Upexi with the necessary institutional-grade tools to confidently expand its digital asset holdings and management strategies. For BitGo , this deal further solidifies its position as a leading provider of crypto custody and financial services for institutional and corporate clients venturing into the digital asset market. Why is Upexi Betting Big on Solana (SOL)? A notable element of Upexi’s new digital asset strategy is its significant focus on Solana (SOL) . The company recently disclosed a substantial increase in its Solana holdings, accumulating 595,000,000 SOL, valued at approximately $100 million at the time of the announcement. This positions Upexi as a major holder of the high-performance blockchain’s native token. Upexi’s decision to concentrate on Solana is reportedly tied to a Solana -based financial strategy. While specific details of this strategy are yet to be fully unveiled, it suggests Upexi may be exploring opportunities within the Solana ecosystem, such as DeFi applications, NFTs, or other potential use cases that align with its business model or investment goals. The choice of Solana indicates a belief in the network’s scalability, speed, and growing ecosystem. The Importance of Institutional Crypto Custody As more corporations and institutions explore integrating digital assets into their balance sheets or business operations, the need for secure and compliant crypto custody solutions becomes paramount. Holding millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency requires specialized security infrastructure, insurance, and regulatory compliance that differs significantly from traditional asset management. This is where firms like BitGo play a critical role. They provide the necessary technological and operational frameworks to protect digital assets from theft, loss, or unauthorized access. For a company like Upexi , transitioning from e-commerce to managing significant crypto holdings, partnering with a trusted custodian like BitGo is a fundamental step to ensure asset safety and build confidence for stakeholders. Navigating Large Trades with OTC Trading Executing large buy or sell orders directly on public cryptocurrency exchanges can lead to significant price slippage and market disruption. This is why OTC trading desks are essential for institutional players. OTC trading allows parties to trade directly with each other, typically facilitated by a broker or a firm like BitGo , outside of the open exchange order books. For Upexi , which plans to potentially increase its Solana holdings further, using BitGo’s OTC trading services enables them to acquire or divest large amounts of SOL discreetly and at negotiated prices, minimizing the impact on the broader market price of Solana . This is a standard practice for large investors and a key service offered by institutional crypto platforms. Looking Ahead: Upexi’s Digital Asset Future With the BitGo partnership in place, Upexi is well-equipped to pursue its ambition of expanding its digital asset portfolio. The company has stated its intention to manage its existing holdings and potentially acquire more Solana . This strategic shift by a non-crypto native company highlights a broader trend of diversification and exploration of value within the digital asset landscape. The success of Upexi’s Solana -based strategy and its digital asset management through BitGo will be closely watched. It could serve as an interesting case study for other e-commerce or traditional businesses considering a similar move into the crypto market. The partnership underscores the growing demand for institutional-grade infrastructure to support this evolution. Conclusion: A Strategic Alignment for Growth The partnership between BitGo and Upexi represents a strategic alignment that provides Upexi with the secure foundation needed to execute its ambitious Solana -focused digital asset strategy. By leveraging BitGo ‘s expertise in crypto custody and OTC trading , Upexi is positioning itself to navigate the complexities of the cryptocurrency market confidently. This collaboration not only benefits both companies but also signals the continued maturation and institutional adoption of the digital asset ecosystem, particularly highlighting the increasing interest in platforms like Solana among corporate entities.

Bitcoin Investors With 10 to 10,000 BTC Have Expanded Holdings Recently In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has talked about the latest trend in the supply held by Bitcoin’s key investors: those holding between between 10 and 10,000 BTC. Related Reading: Bitcoin Near ATH, But Still No Extreme Greed: Green Sign For Bull Run? At the current exchange rate, this range converts to $1 million at the lower end and $1 billion at the upper end. Thus, the only investors who would be able to qualify for it would be the ones with substantial holdings. Generally, the influence of any entity in the market goes up the more supply that they control, so the holders belonging to this range would hold an important place in the ecosystem. Collectively, these investors are popularly known as the sharks and whales. Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm, which shows the trend in the Supply Distribution for the sharks and whales, an indicator that tracks the combined supply held by members of these cohorts: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin sharks and whales have seen their Supply Distribution go up recently, which suggests these large investors have been expanding their holdings. More specifically, the investors falling in the 10 to 10,000 BTC range have added around 83,100 tokens to their wallets over the past month. This accumulation hasn’t come in a constant manner, however, as these investors in fact reduced their supply for a period earlier in the month. This selling from the cohorts followed BTC’s recovery beyond $97,000, so it’s likely that the motive behind it was profit-taking. From the chart, it’s also visible that this selloff resulted in a pullback for the cryptocurrency. During the latest renewal of bullish momentum, the sharks and whales have again resumed their Bitcoin accumulation and have notably surpassed their holdings from the earlier peak. So far, the groups have shown no signs of profit-taking, which can naturally be a bullish sign for the rally’s sustainability. Related Reading: XRP Target Could Be $15 If This Pattern Is In Play, Analyst Says In the same chart, Santiment has also attached the data for the Supply Distribution of the investors carrying less than 0.1 BTC. Interestingly, these investors have been selling while the sharks and whales have gone through accumulation. This could be an indication that the shrimps believe the top could be in soon. Given the accumulation from the large investors, though, the analytics firm notes, “it may be a matter of time until Bitcoin’s coveted $110K all-time high level is breached, particularly after the U.S. & China tariff pause.” BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $103,800, up 11% in the last seven days.

Trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 785,900 followers on the social media platform X that he’s extremely bullish on the crypto market as mainstream institutional players begin to embrace the asset class. According to Van de Poppe, conditions in the crypto market are reminiscent of the Dot-com era, when tech and web-based firms saw their valuation skyrocket as investors piled in and became overexuberant on the emerging sector. “All I know: This is the cycle where everything is going to go ballistic. Higher than ever. The Dot-com bubble type of cycle for crypto, where there’s a lot of liquidity flowing into this asset class and a lot of adoption. It’s basically the only asset class to be significantly outperforming everything.” The Dot-com bubble exploded in 2000, destroying $5 trillion in wealth and driving thousands of companies into bankruptcy. One altcoin on the trader’s radar for a potential repeat of the Dot-com bubble is payments altcoin XRP . Van de Poppe predicts that the coin will come close to its all-time high (ATH) of $3.40. “When things go absolutely vertical, that’s the moment where you want to zoom out and get higher time frame entry points. The same applied for XRP. Marked the level around $1.75 as an important one for entries and it’s up 50% since. I assume we’ll attack the ATHs soon.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, XRP is worth $2.52. The trader is also bullish on the Solana ( SOL ) rival Sei ( SEI ). Van de Poppe predicts that SEI will rally by as much as 169% from current levels. “Indeed, break and flip and the next target is $0.30. I think that SEI will be trending up significantly more. First stop is $0.30, after that a slight correction for people to jump into the asset and then we’ll continue towards the $0.50-0.70 range. ” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, SEI is worth $0.26.

44588308,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=160054,1747180838,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Pioneering: Gibraltar Launches World’s First Crypto Derivatives Clearing Framework,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/gibraltar-crypto-clearing-framework/,"Get ready for a significant leap forward in the world of digital assets! Gibraltar, a jurisdiction known for its forward-thinking approach to crypto regulation, has just announced a groundbreaking initiative. They are set to introduce the world’s first regulatory framework specifically designed for the clearing and settlement of crypto derivatives. This isn’t just another piece of regulation; it’s a move poised to bring a new level of stability and trust to a rapidly evolving market, particularly concerning Gibraltar crypto derivatives trading. Understanding the Need for a Crypto Clearing Framework Before diving into the specifics of Gibraltar’s announcement, let’s talk about why clearing is so crucial, especially in the context of volatile markets like cryptocurrency. In traditional finance, clearing houses sit between buyers and sellers of derivatives contracts (like futures and options). Their primary role is to guarantee the transaction, even if one party defaults. This process, known as central clearing, significantly reduces ‘counterparty risk’ – the risk that the other side of your trade won’t fulfill their obligations. In the burgeoning crypto derivatives market, counterparty risk has been a persistent concern. While many platforms offer derivatives trading, the lack of a standardized, regulated clearing mechanism leaves participants exposed. If a large trading firm or even an exchange itself faces financial distress, it can have cascading effects, potentially leaving other market participants with unrealized losses. Gibraltar’s proposed crypto clearing framework aims to address this head-on. By establishing clear rules and requirements for entities acting as clearing houses for virtual asset derivatives, they are essentially building a safety net. This framework is being developed through a collaboration between the Government of Gibraltar, the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission (GFSC), and Bullish, a crypto exchange with a focus on institutional-grade infrastructure. This partnership brings together regulatory expertise and practical market experience. How Will the Virtual Asset Clearing Framework Work? The core idea behind Gibraltar’s initiative is to adapt well-established principles from traditional financial market clearing to the unique characteristics of virtual assets. While the full details of the framework are yet to be unveiled, we can anticipate key elements based on standard clearing house operations and the information available: Central Counterparty Role: Recognized clearing houses will act as central counterparties (CCPs), becoming the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer. This mutualizes and manages risk. Risk Management: The framework will likely mandate robust risk management procedures for clearing houses, including margin requirements, default management protocols, and stress testing. Segregation of Assets: Rules will likely require the segregation of customer assets from the clearing house’s own funds, providing an extra layer of protection in case of insolvency. Transparency: The framework is expected to enhance market transparency by providing a clearer picture of outstanding positions and risk exposures to regulators and market participants. Eligibility Criteria: There will be stringent requirements for entities seeking recognition as virtual asset clearing houses under the framework. According to reports, the framework specifically targets the clearing and settlement of virtual asset derivative contracts. This means contracts like futures, options, and perpetual swaps whose value is derived from underlying cryptocurrencies or other virtual assets. By focusing on this segment, Gibraltar is addressing one of the riskiest, yet increasingly popular, areas of the crypto market. Benefits of Regulated Digital Asset Clearing Introducing a regulated framework for clearing virtual asset derivatives offers a multitude of benefits for the market and participants: Reduced Counterparty Risk: This is the most significant benefit. By having a regulated clearing house guarantee trades, participants are protected from the default of their individual trading partner. Increased Market Integrity: Central clearing brings standardization and oversight, making the market more robust and less susceptible to manipulation or systemic failure. Enhanced Transparency: Clearing houses provide a central point for monitoring exposures, which can give regulators and market participants better insights into market health and potential risks. Greater Investor Protection: With clear rules and risk management procedures, investors and traders have greater confidence that their trades will be honored. Potential for Institutional Adoption: Traditional financial institutions are often hesitant to engage in unregulated markets due to compliance and risk constraints. A regulated clearing framework can significantly lower this barrier, potentially unlocking substantial institutional capital for Gibraltar crypto derivatives and the wider virtual asset market. Improved Liquidity: As confidence and participation grow, the market becomes more liquid, leading to tighter spreads and better execution prices for traders. Attracting Business to Gibraltar: By being the first to offer such a framework, Gibraltar positions itself as a leader in regulated crypto finance, potentially attracting businesses and talent to the jurisdiction. This move is a clear signal that Gibraltar is serious about fostering a mature, responsible, and sustainable digital asset ecosystem. It builds upon their existing Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) regulatory framework, which has been in place since 2018. Potential Challenges and Considerations While the prospect of regulated digital asset clearing is exciting, implementing such a framework is not without its challenges: Complexity of Virtual Assets: Crypto markets operate 24/7, are highly volatile, and involve various types of assets and networks. Adapting traditional clearing systems, designed for markets with defined trading hours and established assets, requires significant technical and operational innovation. Cross-Border Issues: Crypto markets are global. How will Gibraltar’s framework interact with regulations (or lack thereof) in other jurisdictions? This could create complexities for international firms. Attracting Clearing Houses: Will there be sufficient interest from entities willing and able to meet the stringent requirements to become recognized clearing houses for virtual assets? Technology Integration: Clearing houses will need sophisticated technology to manage the unique aspects of crypto derivatives, including potentially handling settlement in various cryptocurrencies or stablecoins. Regulatory Arbitrage: While Gibraltar leads, the absence of similar frameworks elsewhere could potentially push some activity to less regulated venues, at least in the short term. These are challenges that the GFSC and its partners will need to carefully navigate as they finalize and implement the framework. The collaboration with Bullish suggests a practical approach, leveraging market participant insights to build a workable system. Gibraltar’s Strategic Move in Crypto Derivatives Regulation Gibraltar has consistently aimed to be a reputable hub for digital finance. Its existing DLT framework was one of the first of its kind globally, providing a clear regulatory path for businesses using blockchain technology. Launching the first crypto derivatives regulation specifically for clearing is a logical next step and reinforces this ambition. By focusing on clearing, Gibraltar is targeting a critical piece of financial infrastructure. This is not just about allowing trading; it’s about making trading safer and more reliable. This focus on infrastructure-level regulation is arguably more impactful than simply licensing trading platforms. This framework could serve as a blueprint for other jurisdictions considering how to regulate the complex world of crypto derivatives. As institutional interest in crypto grows, the demand for regulated, secure trading and clearing solutions will only increase. Gibraltar is positioning itself to meet that demand. What This Means for the Market For traders and investors, this framework could mean access to more reliable and less risky ways to trade crypto derivatives. While the initial impact might be on larger, institutionally focused platforms operating under the framework, the increased market maturity and reduced systemic risk could benefit the entire ecosystem in the long run. For crypto businesses, particularly those involved in derivatives, Gibraltar offers a potentially attractive jurisdiction to operate within a clear, regulated environment. This could encourage more sophisticated products and services to be developed and offered under robust oversight. For other regulators, Gibraltar’s approach provides a real-world example of how traditional financial regulation principles can be adapted to the unique challenges of virtual assets. It highlights the importance of focusing on core financial infrastructure like clearing to build a safer market. The development of this framework is a significant step towards bridging the gap between traditional finance and the digital asset space. It acknowledges the growing importance of crypto derivatives while putting essential safeguards in place. Conclusion: A New Era for Crypto Derivatives? Gibraltar’s announcement of the world’s first regulatory framework for clearing and settlement of crypto derivatives is a landmark moment. It signals a maturation of the digital asset market and a proactive approach from regulators to build essential financial infrastructure. By focusing on reducing counterparty risk and enhancing market integrity through regulated clearing houses, Gibraltar is setting a precedent that could influence how other jurisdictions approach crypto derivatives regulation .

The current Mantra (OM) price analysis shows a coin stuck in a holding pattern, trying to break above key levels. Meanwhile, the Ethereum (ETH) price update has caught investor attention, with ETH jumping 7% thanks to the Pectra upgrade. Both tokens have setups worth watching, though each comes with its level of risk. Meanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) is gaining traction due to its Buyer Battles and the current price $0.0262 in batch 28. Traders climb the leaderboard to score massive daily rewards, including unclaimed coins. BlockDAG’s thoughtful design and growing community give it a solid reputation as the best crypto platform. OM Price Stuck Near Resistance With Mixed Signals The latest Mantra (OM) price analysis reveals a coin in limbo. Trading at $0.3636, Mantra recently saw its volume spike nearly 69% in one day before sliding back, suggesting traders are paying attention. According to recent Mantra price analysis, the coin bounced off support but continues to stall under the $0.42 resistance zone. If OM can break through that barrier, analysts say a run to $0.45 or even $0.48 could follow. But there are caution signs too. The OM price still struggles with a high fully diluted valuation compared to its total value locked. Profit-taking and macro headwinds might cap any near-term rally. Until OM clears that $0.42 line, the upside comes with hesitation. ETH Price Update: Pectra Upgrade Sparks Investor Confidence The newest Ethereum (ETH) price update comes as the Pectra upgrade lands, bringing serious improvements to how users interact with the network. ETH is now trading at $1,958, up nearly 7% in 24 hours. This bump follows the merger of Prague and Electra into a new upgrade suite called Pectra, which includes easier wallet features and gas payments in multiple tokens. One key change, the validator cap moving from 32 ETH to 2,048, caters to larger holders like ETF issuers. As this Ethereum (ETH) price update notes, investor interest is growing, with over 3.5 million ETH accumulated in under two months. Short-term targets now hover around $2,200 and $4,000. BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles Turn Trading Into a Race BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles are making crypto buying feel like a high-stakes contest. Every day, 25 million BDAG coins hit the presale market. Buyers rush in, and anything left behind? It goes straight to the biggest spender of the day, no paperwork, no fine print, just pure reward. That’s helped push total presale funds past $241 million, with more than 20.1 billion BDAG coins already sold. Those who joined early? They’re sitting on a 2,520% ROI. And with the current batch price $0.0262 to the launch price $0.05, today’s buyers can lock in over 90% ROI. This competitive format is creating real winners. If just 20% of that day’s allocation goes unclaimed, the top buyer could walk away with nearly $131K worth of BDAG at the batch price of $0.0262, or as much as $250K if the coin launches at $0.05. Veteran buyers are circling back to protect their spots, while new players are jumping in to grab BDAG on the cheap. Social media buzzes every night as wallets battle it out before the midnight UTC deadline. For anyone looking for the best crypto platform that combines utility and excitement, BlockDAG is making its case in real time. What Should Traders Watch Now? Traders are eyeing two key markers this week: OM trying to clear $0.42, and ETH aiming for $2,200. The Mantra (OM) price analysis remains cautiously optimistic, while the Ethereum (ETH) price update shows solid growth potential thanks to Pectra. But the real energy is flowing toward BlockDAG. With Buyer Battles driving daily action, the current batch 28th price $0.0262, and a chance to claim unclaimed coins, BDAG offers a different momentum. With early buyers already up 2,520%, those on the sidelines might want to act before May 13 closes the window.

Investors felt safe keeping most of their wealth in U.S.-based assets for years because of the country’s strong economy, stable currency, and deep financial markets. Still, recent trade disputes, new tariffs, and concerns about the long-term strength of the dollar are crushing their confidence. UBS clients reduce U.S.-dollar exposure as volatility rises The co-head of wealth management for Asia at USB, Amy Lo, said that the company’s wealthy clients are pulling away from U.S.-dollar investments as they feel uneasy about putting too much of their money in assets tied to the U.S. dollar amid global economic uncertainty and the ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China . Amy Lo also noted that most of their clients are turning to gold because it isn’t tied to any single government or currency, while others are putting their cash in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are becoming more widely accepted as alternative assets that balance traditional portfolios. Pro-crypto lawyer and strong advocate for XRP holders, John Deaton, even commented in a post on X saying, “We have officially reached the point where it is far more riskier to have zero exposure to Crypto than it is to allocate a small percentage of your net worth to it.” Clients are also looking for opportunities that offer growth without relying on the U.S. economy alone, which makes them more focused on managing risks and not just chasing high returns. UBS and other wealth management firms stated that these investors are adopting structured asset allocation models that spread risk more evenly. Morgan Stanley, for example, recommends a 40-40-15 split whereby 40% of your assets are in fixed-income bonds, another 40% in equities or stocks, and 15% in alternative investments like private equity or hedge funds, with the remaining 5% held in cash or cash-like assets in case of market downturns. Investors regain confidence in China and shift allocations Many wealthy investors who avoided the Chinese market for the past few years because of poor performance, strict regulations, and ongoing tensions with the United States are now slowly shifting their money back into Chinese assets due to strong stock performance, a more positive trade environment , and innovations from Chinese companies. Hong Kong’s stock market, the Hang Send Index (HSI) , is one of the best-performing stock indexes in the world in 2025, and Amy Lo explains that clients are now asking her directly about investment opportunities in the country after years of avoiding anything to do with China. This shift shows how quickly investor sentiment can change when signs of progress and stability appear. The recent tariff truce between the U.S. and China helped cool down some trade war tensions that affected global markets. The United States lowered its tariffs on most Chinese imports from 145% to 30% for 90 days, while China cut down its duties from 125% to 10% and agreed to remove some of their countermeasures set in 2018, which gave investors hope that trade will continue to improve and make China a more attractive opportunity. A private wealth management expert at Morgan Stanley believes that the recent trade agreement between China and the U.S. has created new growth opportunities in both countries and that repositioning investor interest back to China is simultaneous with a recovery in U.S. growth stocks. Morgan Stanley expects its high-net-worth clients will earn 7% to 8% in total annual returns over the next seven to ten years, but Christina warns that achieving these returns is now more difficult because of volatile markets. For this reason, clients are now rethinking how much risk they are taking, how their portfolios are balanced, and what role each type of investment plays in helping them meet their financial goals.

This milestone marks a decentralized network overtaking one of China's largest technology companies in market value. Concurrently, Ethereum's market cap has also exceeded that of Coca-Cola. The surge in Ethereum's valuation has been accompanied by substantial buying activity from Abraxas Capital, a London-based asset management firm. Over the past six days, Abraxas Capital has acquired nearly $500 million worth of Ethereum, purchasing over 211,000 ETH. The firm reportedly borrowed $240 million in USDT from the decentralized lending platform Aave and transferred it to Binance, suggesting continued accumulation of Ethereum assets. This buying spree coincides with Ethereum's price rally past $2,600. There is speculation about the identity and motives of Abraxas Capital, with some noting previous transactions linking it to Alameda Research before the latter's collapse.

For those tracking technological advancements, particularly in areas like Generative AI , the impact is becoming increasingly visible across various sectors. This trend is now significantly influencing how we consume literature, with Audible, Amazon’s prominent audiobook service, making a major move to leverage AI. What is Audible Doing with AI Narration? Audible recently announced a strategic initiative to partner with publishers to convert print and e-books into audiobooks using AI narration . This approach is designed to rapidly expand Audible’s content library. In a competitive market against platforms like Apple and Spotify, a larger, diverse catalog is a key differentiator. By utilizing artificial intelligence, Audible can streamline the production process, making it faster and potentially more cost-effective for publishers to turn written works into audio experiences. This expansion leverages sophisticated AI capabilities developed by Amazon. Publishers collaborating with Audible have access to a variety of AI-generated voices. Currently, over 100 different AI voices are available, supporting English, French, Spanish, and Italian languages, with options for various accents and dialects. Audible has indicated plans to increase the selection of voices and languages over time, enhancing the versatility of its Audible AI platform. How Does Amazon AI Power This? The core technology enabling this initiative comes from Amazon’s extensive AI research and development. Amazon AI provides the underlying infrastructure and models required for high-quality text-to-speech conversion. This isn’t Audible’s first foray into using synthetic voices. In 2023, Amazon launched an invite-only beta program featuring a ‘virtual voice’ tool aimed at self-published authors in the U.S. This tool allowed independent creators to transform their e-books into audiobooks using synthetic speech technology, significantly lowering the barrier to entry for audiobook production. The adoption of this ‘virtual voice’ technology by self-published authors highlights its practical benefits. A search on Audible reveals tens of thousands of titles explicitly labeled as narrated by ‘Virtual Voice’. This demonstrates that the technology is popular, especially among authors who might lack the financial resources or time typically required for traditional audiobook narration, which involves hiring professional voice actors and studio time. AI audiobooks produced this way offer a scalable solution for content creators. Are There Concerns About AI Audiobooks? Despite the clear advantages in speed and scale, the widespread introduction of AI-generated narrations has sparked considerable discussion and debate within the publishing industry and among listeners. Critics frequently voice concerns regarding the potential impact of these AI recordings on the overall quality and artistic integrity of audiobooks. Professional narrators, in particular, have raised questions about the nuances, emotional depth, and performance aspects that human narrators bring to a text, which AI might struggle to replicate convincingly. It’s worth noting that Audible has also explored partnerships with human narrators in the context of AI. Last year, Audible reportedly invited a group of audiobook narrators to participate in training AI models on their voices, suggesting an interest in developing more sophisticated or personalized AI narration capabilities, potentially blurring the lines between fully synthetic and AI-assisted narration. What About AI Translation? Looking ahead, Audible is also planning to introduce Generative AI capabilities for translation later in the year. A beta version of AI translation services is expected to roll out, offering both text-to-text and speech-to-speech translation. Initially, this will support translations from English into Spanish, French, Italian, and German. This feature could open up vast libraries of content to new language markets without the need for manual translation and re-narration. Recognizing the critical need for accuracy in translation, especially for published works, Audible plans to offer publishers the option to engage professional linguists to review and refine these AI-generated translations. This hybrid approach aims to combine the speed and efficiency of AI with human expertise to ensure quality and fidelity to the original text. How Does Audible Compare to Competitors? The move towards AI narration is not unique to Audible. Spotify, which has emerged as the second-largest provider of audiobooks after Audible, has also recently invested efforts into expanding its audiobook catalog using AI tools. In February, Spotify announced a partnership with ElevenLabs, a prominent AI audio technology provider. This indicates that the use of artificial intelligence for content creation, specifically in the audiobook space, is becoming a key area of competition among major platforms. The competition between Audible and Spotify, fueled by advancements in Amazon AI and other AI technologies, is likely to accelerate the production and availability of audiobooks globally. While the debate over AI narration quality continues, the accessibility and speed offered by this technology are undeniable drivers of market expansion. Conclusion: The Future of AI Audiobooks Audible’s aggressive expansion of its AI audiobooks library marks a significant moment in the evolution of digital content. By leveraging Generative AI and Amazon AI , Audible is not only aiming to boost its catalog size but also potentially reshape the economics and accessibility of audiobook production for publishers and authors alike. While concerns about quality and the role of human narrators persist, the efficiency and scale offered by AI narration are poised to make audiobooks more widely available than ever before. As the technology improves and translation capabilities are added, we can expect AI to play an even larger role in how stories are told and heard across the globe.

44588469,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=160056,1747182033,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,AI Export Rules: Trump Administration Abruptly Halts Biden Policy,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-halts-ai-rules/,"In a move that has significant implications for the technology sector, particularly concerning advanced AI development and the global supply chain for critical components, the Trump administration AI team has officially reversed a key policy introduced by the previous administration. After a period of speculation, the U.S. Department of Commerce formally rescinded the Biden Administration’s Artificial Intelligence Diffusion Rule. This rule, part of the broader Biden AI policy , was poised to introduce new export limitations on U.S.-made AI chips to various countries and strengthen existing controls, marking a pivotal shift in how the U.S. managed its technological exports. Understanding the Previous Biden AI Policy The Artificial Intelligence Diffusion Rule, championed under the Biden AI policy and scheduled to take effect soon after its announcement in January, represented a structured approach to controlling the proliferation of advanced AI technology. It was designed to limit the ability of certain nations to access cutting-edge AI chips , which are essential for training sophisticated AI models. The core of the rule involved a tiered system categorizing countries based on perceived risk levels regarding technology diffusion: Tier 1 Countries: Nations considered close allies, such as Japan and South Korea, would have faced minimal to no new restrictions on receiving U.S. AI chips . Tier 2 Countries: This group included countries like Mexico and Portugal. For the first time, these regions would have encountered specific limits on the export of certain AI technologies and components. Tier 3 Countries: Countries deemed adversaries or high-risk, including China and Russia, would have seen existing controls tightened significantly, making it even harder for them to acquire advanced U.S. AI chips . This tiered approach aimed to balance national security concerns with international cooperation, but it also generated debate about its potential impact on global technology markets and research collaborations. Why the Trump Administration AI Team Reversed Course On Tuesday, the US Commerce Department , now operating under the directive of the Trump administration, announced that it had instructed its staff not to implement or enforce the Biden-era regulation. This decision effectively puts the brakes on the structured tiered system just days before its planned implementation. U.S. Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Security Jeffery Kessler provided insight into the rationale behind this abrupt change. He stated that the Trump administration AI strategy would pursue a different path, focusing on a “bold, inclusive strategy to American AI technology with trusted foreign countries around the world.” This contrasts with the blanket restrictions proposed under the previous Biden AI policy . Kessler explicitly rejected the Biden administration’s approach, labeling it “ill-conceived and counterproductive AI policies.” The administration appears to favor direct, country-by-country negotiations and targeted agreements rather than broad, predefined restrictions. This suggests a potential shift towards a more flexible, perhaps more politically driven, approach to managing technology exports and international AI collaboration. What’s Next for AI Chips and Export Controls? With the rescission of the Biden-era rule, the immediate future of U.S. AI export rules is somewhat uncertain, though the US Commerce Department has indicated its intentions. While the specific regulation is gone, the underlying concerns about technology transfer remain. The DOC plans to develop and issue a replacement rule in the future. In the interim, the US Commerce Department released guidance to the industry, emphasizing existing regulations and potential risks. Key points highlighted include: A reminder that using Huawei’s Ascend AI chips anywhere globally constitutes a violation of current U.S. export regulations. A warning about the significant potential consequences for U.S. companies if their AI chips are discovered being used to train AI models in China, underscoring the ongoing sensitivity around advanced AI development in that region. Recommendations for companies to enhance measures protecting their chip supply chains from diversion tactics, ensuring technology does not end up in unauthorized hands or locations. This guidance suggests that while the *method* of control is changing, the *goal* of preventing adversaries from accessing advanced U.S. AI chips remains a priority for the Trump administration AI strategy. The Implications of Changing AI Export Rules The sudden change in AI export rules has several potential implications: Industry Uncertainty: Companies involved in semiconductor manufacturing, AI hardware, and related software face uncertainty as they await the new framework. Planning global sales and partnerships becomes more complex without clear, long-term regulations. Geopolitical Dynamics: The shift from a tiered system to direct negotiations could alter diplomatic relations and technology partnerships. It might offer more flexibility but could also lead to inconsistent policies across different countries. Pace of Innovation: Some argue that blanket restrictions can slow down global AI development. A move towards more targeted controls, if implemented effectively, might potentially facilitate certain international collaborations, though national security remains a tight constraint. Competitive Landscape: The policy changes could impact the competitive positioning of U.S. companies versus international rivals in the AI chips market. The stated aim of the Trump administration AI approach is to be “inclusive” with trusted partners while keeping technology from adversaries. The success of this approach will depend heavily on the specifics of the forthcoming replacement rule and the effectiveness of direct negotiations. Conclusion: A New Era for AI Technology Policy The formal rescission of the Biden Administration’s Artificial Intelligence Diffusion Rule by the US Commerce Department marks a significant pivot in U.S. technology export policy. The structured, tiered approach of the Biden AI policy is being replaced by what the Trump administration AI team suggests will be a more flexible strategy centered on direct engagement and targeted controls. While the industry awaits the details of the new framework, the immediate guidance from the DOC underscores the continued focus on preventing sensitive AI chips and technology from reaching potential adversaries. This policy shift highlights the ongoing tension between fostering international technological advancement and safeguarding national security interests in the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence, particularly concerning critical components like AI chips .

Tether snapped up 4,812.2 Bitcoin ( BTC ) at $95,319 each and transferred it to an escrow wallet on May 9, Cantor Equity Partners disclosed in a May 13 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. It brings Twenty One’s total Bitcoin holdings to 36,312 BTC, as Cantor Equity Partners holds 31,500 BTC on behalf of the firm, which will trade under the ticker XXI once the SPAC merger is complete. Twenty One’s CEO, Jack Mallers, said on May 13 that they’re already in the approval process of the merger, but didn’t give an exact estimate on when the transaction would be complete. Twenty One is already the third largest corporate Bitcoin holder, trailing only Strategy and Bitcoin mining firm MARA Holdings at 568,840 Bitcoin and 48,237 Bitcoin, respectively, BitcoinTreasuries.net data shows. Tether is a majority stakeholder in Twenty One alongside crypto exchange Bitfinex. The Wall Street heavyweight Cantor Fitzgerald is sponsoring the merger, providing financial advisory services and securing $585 million in funding to support Twenty One’s Bitcoin investments. Japanese investment holding firm SoftBank also invested $900 million into Twenty One, which is led by Strike CEO Jack Mallers. Strategy may have a legitimate competitor Twenty One said in an April presentation to the SEC that is looking to supplant Michael Saylor’s Strategy , formerly MicroStrategy, to become the “superior vehicle” for investors seeking “capital-efficient Bitcoin exposure.” The company is among many Bitcoin buying firms , but promises to be a “pure play” for investors seeking Bitcoin exposure with Bitcoin-native operations and more flexibility for strategic capital raises.

Earlier filings showed that 23,950 Bitcoin is expected to come from Tether, 10,500 Bitcoin from Softbank and about 7,000 Bitcoin from Bitfinex, which will be converted into equity at $10 per share. Cantor Equity Partners’ (CEP) share price soared from $10.65 to $59.73 on May 2 but has since fallen back to $29.84, Google Finance data shows.

While the technology, which uses the quantum states of subatomic particles to perform calculations instead of transistors and binary code, is still in its infancy, companies including Google and Microsoft are pressing forward with research and development. The goal is a massive step-up in speed that makes tough calculations like cracking encryption, such as that used to protect blockchains, faster and simpler. And when quantum computing becomes available, any attacker is unlikely to announce their presence immediately. “The threat won’t start with Satoshi’s keys getting stolen,"" Dillion said in an interview. “The real quantum attack will look subtle, quiet, and gradual, like whales casually moving funds. By the time everyone realizes what’s happening, it’ll be too late."" Dillion's doomsday scenario involves a quantum-computing-powered double-spend attack. In theory, quantum computing could reduce the mining power required for a traditional 51% attack down to about 26%, Dillion said. ""So now you've compromised the 10,000 largest wallets. You rewind the chain, liquidate those 10,000 largest wallets, then double spend all the transactions, and now you've really got a nuclear bomb,” is how he imagines it. The industry, of course, is working to find a solution. Bitcoin developer Agustin Cruz, for instance, proposed QRAMP , a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) that mandates a hard-fork migration to quantum-secure addresses. Quantum startup BTQ has proposed replacing the proof-of-work consensus system that underpins the original blockchain entirely with quantum-native consensus. The problem is that the proposals must gain community approval. Blockchain governance, such as Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) and their Ethereum equivalents, Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), tends to be rife with politics, making it a long, inherently cautious process. For example, the Bitcoin community's recent resolution on the OP_RETURN function was years in the making, with months of developer debates about what's considered the ""proper"" use of the blockchain. Ethereum's upgrades, like the Merge, also faced lengthy debates and delays . Dillion argues that the governance process leaves crypto dangerously exposed because quantum computing threats will evolve much faster than the protocols can respond. “Everyone's trying to do this from the top down by starting with a BIP or an EIP and getting everyone's buy-in together. But we think that this is a very difficult, heavy lift,” he said. Quip Network’s quantum-proof vaults aim to circumvent the political inertia by allowing immediate user-level adoption without requiring protocol upgrades. The vaults leverage hybrid cryptography, blending classical cryptographic standards with quantum-resistant techniques to provide blockchain-agnostic security. Effectively, they allow the whales, holders of large amounts of a cryptocurrency, to secure their stashes while waiting for the machinations of blockchain governance to get it together. Crypto communities can't afford leisurely debates, he argues. “The BIP and EIP processes are great for governance, but terrible for rapid threat response,” said Dillion. ""When quantum hits, attackers won’t wait for community consensus.” Colton Dillon is speaking at the IEEE Canada Blockchain Forum, part of Consensus 2025 in Toronto. The IEEE is a Knowledge Partner of Consensus.

The latest wave of innovation is hitting how we consume media, and one exciting development comes from the realm of music streaming. Spotify is rolling out a significant update to its Spotify AI DJ feature, introducing interactive voice commands. This isn’t just about listening; it’s about telling your AI what you want to hear, marking a leap forward in personalized audio experiences. How Spotify AI DJ Voice Commands Work The Spotify AI DJ , first launched in early 2023, initially served as a curated stream with commentary. Now, it’s evolving into a truly interactive assistant. The core functionality revolves around using your voice to influence the music being played. Here’s a breakdown: Initiating the DJ: You can find the AI DJ by typing “DJ” in the Spotify search bar. Making Voice Requests: Once the DJ is active, you can hold down the dedicated DJ button (typically located on the bottom right) to speak your commands. What You Can Request: Users can ask the AI DJ to play specific songs, request tracks from particular artists, change the current genre, or even alter the overall mood of the playlist it’s generating. Quick Mood Change: If you don’t have a specific voice request but want to quickly shift the vibe, a quick press of the DJ button can prompt the AI to transition to a different style or mood. This feature is currently rolling out in over 60 markets, initially supporting English voice commands. This expansion makes the interactive AI DJ accessible to a much wider global audience, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with streaming technology . The Benefits of Enhanced Music Personalization Why is adding voice commands to the Spotify AI DJ such a big deal? It significantly enhances the user experience through deeper music personalization . Here are some key benefits: Effortless Control: Change the music without needing to navigate menus or type searches. Ideal for when you’re driving, cooking, or otherwise occupied. Dynamic Discovery: Instead of passively listening, you can actively guide the AI to explore different genres, artists, or moods on the fly, leading to more tailored music discovery. More Engaging Experience: The ability to talk to your AI DJ makes the interaction feel more like having a personal curator who responds to your immediate preferences. Instant Adaptation: Your mood can change rapidly. Voice commands allow the AI DJ to adapt almost instantly, ensuring the music always fits the moment. This level of control moves beyond traditional algorithmic playlists, offering a more fluid and responsive way to interact with Spotify’s vast library and the potential of AI music curation. The Technology Powering AI Music Interaction While the user experience is simple, the technology behind the Spotify AI DJ and its new voice capabilities is complex. It involves a combination of advanced AI models: Speech Recognition: Converting spoken voice commands into text or actionable instructions. Natural Language Processing (NLP): Understanding the intent and context of user requests, even if phrased casually or ambiguously. Recommendation Engines: Leveraging Spotify’s extensive data on user listening habits, musical attributes, and trends to select appropriate songs based on the voice commands. Generative AI (for commentary): While not directly tied to voice commands, the original DJ feature used generative AI to create the spoken commentary between songs, adding to the personalized feel. Integrating these components allows the AI DJ to not just understand what you say but also make intelligent decisions about the music it plays next, creating a seamless blend of user input and algorithmic curation. This sophisticated use of AI music technology is a testament to the potential of AI in enhancing digital services. Comparing Spotify’s AI DJ to Other AI Features Spotify isn’t new to leveraging AI. Besides the Spotify AI DJ , the company also introduced a feature allowing users to create playlists using text prompts. How does the interactive AI DJ with voice commands stack up? Text Prompt Playlists: This feature is great for creating a playlist based on a specific theme, activity, or mood described in text. It’s useful for building a static collection. Interactive AI DJ: The AI DJ is designed for dynamic, real-time listening. Voice commands allow for instant adjustments and continuous discovery within a live stream, rather than building a fixed list. Complementary Tools: These features serve different purposes. The text prompt tool is for curation and collection building, while the AI DJ with voice is for live, adaptive playback and exploration. Both features demonstrate Spotify’s commitment to using AI to improve music personalization , offering users different ways to interact with and discover music based on their needs and preferences at any given moment. They represent different facets of how streaming technology is evolving. Future Outlook and Potential Challenges The introduction of voice commands for the Spotify AI DJ opens up exciting possibilities for the future of music streaming. Imagine a truly conversational AI DJ that can discuss music, provide trivia, or even help you discover artists based on subtle nuances in your requests. However, there are potential challenges: Accuracy of Voice Recognition: Ensuring the AI accurately understands commands across different accents, languages, and background noise is crucial for user satisfaction. Natural Language Understanding: The AI needs to handle complex or ambiguous requests gracefully. Scalability: Rolling out sophisticated AI features like this globally, especially with multilingual support, requires significant infrastructure and ongoing development. User Adoption: Will users readily adopt talking to their music app? The feature needs to provide clear value and ease of use. Despite these challenges, the trajectory suggests a future where our interactions with streaming technology become increasingly intuitive and personalized, with AI music curators playing a central role. Actionable Insights for Users Ready to try out the new interactive Spotify AI DJ ? Here’s how you can make the most of the new voice commands : Experiment with Requests: Don’t just ask for specific songs. Try asking the DJ to “play something upbeat,” “switch to jazz,” or “play more songs like this one.” Refine Your Language: Pay attention to how the AI responds to different phrasing and adjust your commands for better results. Use the Quick Press: When you’re unsure what you want but need a change, a quick press of the DJ button is an easy way to refresh the music. Provide Feedback: While not a direct voice command feature, using Spotify’s feedback mechanisms can help improve the AI over time. Embracing these interactive features allows you to take greater control of your listening experience and unlock deeper levels of music personalization provided by this evolving AI music feature. Conclusion: A New Era of Music Interaction Spotify’s integration of voice commands into its Spotify AI DJ is a significant step forward in the evolution of music streaming. It transforms a passive listening experience into an interactive one, offering users unprecedented control over their real-time music personalization . This move highlights the growing impact of AI on how we interact with digital content and services.

Enter Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a low-priced token rapidly gaining attention from those who saw DOGE transform $5,000 into $300,000 in just six months. With its innovative approach to decentralized finance and the backing of a passionate community, MUTM is emerging as the next big opportunity. The project is already at Phase 4 of its presale and has already raised more than $8 million and more than 9,700 investors. With over 70% sold out during this stage, the price will go up by 20% to $0.03 in Phase 5 and with an expected launch price of $0.06. As crypto enthusiasts and Dogecoin investors look for the next big breakout, MUTM is shaping up to be a serious coin, potentially delivering gains that could rival DOGE’s past meteoric rise. Mutuum Finance: A New Era in DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance is not another DeFi wave-rider project it provides a twin lending mechanism incorporating Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) capabilities. The hybrid system offers stability as well as control to users. P2C Lending enables investors to receive yield by providing stablecoins such as USDT to lending pools that are governed by smart contracts, providing a safe and automated means of earning passive income. In contrast, P2P Lending allows direct borrowing and lending relations between users with no middlemen. This aspect enhances privacy and allows for more personalized lending, giving users more control over the transaction. Through this novel setup Mutuum Finance is now a viable and scalable product within the DeFi ecosystem. It is also currently undergoing a third-party audit by Certik to further enhance transparency and investor trust. Presale Growth and Launch Price Expectations Currently, at $0.025, the MUTM token is highly sought after. Those who invest now at this stage in Phase 4 are set to appreciate by 20% once Phase 5 begins. The market launch price is at $0.06, but some crypto analysts are already predicting it is going to be up within no time after its release, an exponential rise compared to today’s prices in the presale. These are the explanations why MUTM is one of the most debated low-price DeFi coins. Fueling Growth Through Community and Rewards The platform is also developing a thriving community with reward-based mechanics. There is an active leaderboard that shows the top 50 token holders and rewarding them with additional MUTM tokens. In addition, there is a token giveaway with a $100,000 prize ongoing, in which ten winners will receive $10,000 each in MUTM. A referral program also incentivizes user growth by rewarding participants who refer new users to the platform. Why Investors Are Taking Notice Mutuum Finance is becoming one of the most sensational early-stage decentralized finance opportunities. As the token draws near its next price milestone and launch, early investors would be much better off enjoying token appreciation along with platform rewards. Just as Dogecoin turned early believers into crypto legends, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now drawing in a new wave of investors chasing outsized gains, with some eyeing the potential to flip $5K into $300K within months. Already raising $8M+ from over 9,700 backers, and with Phase 4 over 70% sold out, MUTM is proving it’s not just hype, it’s momentum backed by innovation. With the next phase bringing a 20% price increase, and a launch target of $0.06, today’s entry point at $0.025 could be the last chance for investors to get in at the ground floor. Don’t wait until MUTM is trending, move now or risk missing the next DOGE-sized breakout.

Currently priced at $2.52 , XRP has dropped 3.05% in the last 24 hours , with a $147.33 billion market cap . While Ripple’s regulatory clarity has boosted investor confidence, its massive market cap limits its growth potential. Enter Ruvi . This presale crypto is going to outperform Ripple and deliver crazy returns. It’s early stage innovation + bonus packed presale = can’t miss opportunity for forward thinking investors. Ripple’s Past Success vs Ruvi’s Future Ripple’s blockchain has revolutionized cross border payments with its speed and scalability. Recent SEC clarity has solidified its position as a regulated crypto, attracting institutional interest. But here’s the thing: Ripple’s massive market cap means there’s limited room for the exponential gains we saw in its early days. Ruvi is in its early stage . By getting in on Ruvi’s presale you’re basically buying into the beginning of what could be the next XRP like success story. With its AI driven features and blockchain efficiencies Ruvi is going to disrupt the industry in ways Ripple can no longer. Where Ruvi Stands Out: Presale Bonuses A key difference? Ruvi’s presale bonus structure designed to reward early adopters big time. By getting in now you’ll increase your holdings before it hits the public market.

44589606,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=160069,1747184406,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Thailand Digital Bond: Unlocking $150M G-Token Opportunity,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/thailand-digital-bond-g-token/,"Are you interested in how traditional finance is converging with the world of digital assets? A significant development is unfolding in Southeast Asia, as Thailand takes a bold step into the realm of tokenized government bond issuances. The news centers around the planned issuance of a substantial Thailand digital bond , specifically a digital investment token dubbed the G-Token, by the nation’s Finance Ministry. What is the Planned G-Token Thailand Issuance? According to reports from Bloomberg, Thailand’s Finance Ministry is preparing to issue 5 billion baht, which translates to approximately $150 million USD, through a digital investment token known as the G-Token. This initiative was highlighted by Thailand’s Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister, Pichai Chunhavajira. He indicated that the G-Token issuance is expected to occur within the next two months, forming a part of the government’s broader budget borrowing strategy. The core idea behind this G-Token issuance is to leverage digital technology to streamline and potentially enhance the traditional bond market. While specific technical details about the underlying platform (likely a form of distributed ledger technology or blockchain) are still emerging, the focus is clearly on creating a digital representation of a sovereign debt instrument. Why Issue a Tokenized Government Bond? Exploring the Benefits The move towards a tokenized government bond offers several potential advantages, both for the issuer (the Thai government) and for investors. The Finance Minister pointed to a couple of key benefits directly: Accessibility for Small Investors: One significant aspect mentioned is that investors will be able to participate in the G-Token bond issuance with relatively small amounts of cash. Traditional government bonds often require high minimum investment thresholds, limiting access for individual retail investors. Tokenization, by allowing for fractional ownership, can democratize access to these financial instruments. Boosting Secondary Market Trading: The digital token format is anticipated to potentially boost secondary market bond trading. Tokenization can facilitate faster settlement times and potentially increase liquidity compared to traditional bond markets, which can sometimes be less efficient, especially for smaller trades. Beyond these specific points, the general benefits often associated with tokenizing assets, including bonds, can include: Increased Transparency: Transactions recorded on a distributed ledger can offer greater transparency (depending on the specific setup). Improved Efficiency: Automated processes via smart contracts can reduce manual effort and costs. 24/7 Trading Potential: Digital markets can theoretically operate around the clock, unlike traditional markets with set hours. Sovereign Digital Bond: Part of a Global Trend? Thailand’s plan to issue a sovereign digital bond is not happening in a vacuum. Governments and international financial institutions globally have been exploring or implementing similar initiatives. Examples include the European Investment Bank (EIB) which has issued digital bonds on a blockchain platform, and the World Bank which has also experimented with bond tokenization. These moves signal a growing interest among sovereign and quasi-sovereign entities in exploring how digital ledger technology can be applied to traditional capital markets. While each implementation varies in design and purpose, the overarching theme is the exploration of technology to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and potentially broaden investor bases for government debt. Implications for Thailand Blockchain Finance This G-Token issuance represents a significant step for the landscape of Thailand blockchain finance . It signals the government’s willingness to embrace digital asset technology beyond just cryptocurrencies, applying it to core financial infrastructure like debt markets. This could have several ripple effects: Validation: A government-backed digital asset issuance lends credibility to the broader blockchain and digital asset ecosystem within Thailand. Infrastructure Development: It may necessitate or accelerate the development of necessary digital infrastructure, regulatory frameworks, and technical expertise within the country. Innovation Catalyst: It could encourage further innovation and adoption of blockchain technology by private sector financial institutions in Thailand. This move aligns with Thailand’s broader digital transformation goals and its efforts to position itself as a technologically advanced nation in the region. Potential Challenges and Considerations While the benefits are promising, the path to successful implementation of a Thailand digital bond is not without potential challenges. These could include: Regulatory Clarity: Ensuring the appropriate legal and regulatory framework is in place for digital bonds. Investor Education: Educating both institutional and retail investors about this new format of investment. Technology Risk: Ensuring the underlying technology is secure, reliable, and scalable. Market Adoption and Liquidity: Building sufficient interest and infrastructure to ensure a liquid secondary market develops as hoped. Careful planning and execution will be crucial to navigate these potential hurdles. A Compelling Step Forward Thailand’s plan to issue a $150 million G-Token digital bond is a noteworthy development in the convergence of traditional finance and digital assets. By potentially lowering the barrier to entry for investors and aiming to enhance secondary market trading, this initiative could serve as a significant case study for how governments can leverage tokenization for sovereign debt. It underscores the growing relevance of blockchain and digital asset technology in mainstream financial markets and marks a positive stride for Thailand blockchain finance on the global stage.

TRON has set a new record for stablecoin supply at $71.9 billion in USDT, yet TRX struggles to break past $0.25. Solana, priced near $146, is holding steady while bulls and bears battle for control. Amid these uncertain moves, Unstaked has exploded onto the scene, raising over $1 million in just 24 hours and reaching more than $5 million in total presale funds. Currently in stage 10 at $0.008234, Unstaked offers a rare presale opportunity. With no insider allocations, every buyer gets the same chance at success in this viral project. TRON Battles $0.25 as Strong Fundamentals Fail to Lift Price TRON (TRX) has made big gains in the stablecoin sector with $71.9 billion in USDT, fueled by six billion-dollar USDT mints by Tether since April. The network has grown fast, with monthly DEX volume rising 40% from $3.4 billion in March to $4.9 billion in April. TRON now hosts over 302 million accounts and more than 10 billion transactions. Even with this strength, TRX trades at around $0.243 and struggles to break the $0.25 wall. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 48.7 reflects market uncertainty. If TRX loses the $0.240 support, analysts say $0.235 could be the next stop. TRON’s $5 billion total value locked and growing institutional interest show promise. However, the price remains stuck in a tight range and only a breakout above $0.25 can fuel a real rally. Solana Holds Steady as Bulls Watch for Breakout Solana continues to show solid network growth despite recent price stalling. Trading at around $146, Solana’s stablecoin supply has hit $13 billion, and its TVL has grown to $7.65 billion. It leads daily DEX activity with over 57.77 million daily transactions. The price moves in a range between $130 and $150, with key resistance at $156. Analysts see a possible rally to $220 if SOL breaks out of this bull flag pattern. Lower trading volumes show hesitation, leaving SOL hovering in a tight channel. Large investors like DeFi Development Corp and SOL Strategies are still accumulating, showing long-term belief in Solana. For now, short-term price action remains stuck as buyers and sellers wait for the next big move. Unstaked’s $0.00848 Presale Sparks Investor Excitement As TRON and Solana navigate through their market struggles, Unstaked has quickly gained attention from investors. In just one day, Unstaked raised over $1 million, taking its total presale to $5 million. The project has stood out by refusing insider or developer allocations. Instead, all tokens are sold directly to public participants, ensuring fairness and security for buyers. Currently in stage 10, Unstaked is priced at $0.008234, offering early supporters a rare chance to enter a project with strong potential. The launch price is set at $0.1819, which gives early buyers a significant upside. All activity is fully verifiable on-chain, reflecting the project’s commitment to transparency and safety. Unstaked AI introduces a platform where anyone can design, customise, and deploy their smart agents. These digital assistants are built to automate tasks, connect with audiences, and boost productivity. From social media handling to customer service and marketing automation, users can assign agents to meet their needs. The system is backed by blockchain, which guarantees that each agent is secure and owned by the user. Unlike traditional AI services run by large companies, Unstaked users have full control over their agents. The $UNSD token powers this platform and allows owners to enhance their agents’ features. Whether you are a creator wanting to grow your presence, a business aiming for efficiency, or a marketer seeking smarter automation, Unstaked delivers a flexible AI solution. This is not just another AI tool. It is your personal AI network built for you. Key Takeaway TRON’s network has expanded, with its stablecoin supply and user activity reaching records. Still, TRX struggles to hold above $0.25. Solana trades near $146, showing strong DeFi growth and attracting big investors, yet remains trapped in a limited price range. Meanwhile, Unstaked has caught early attention by raising over $1 million in just one day, with no insider allocations. The project’s focus on fairness and transparency has attracted buyers. At a crypto presale price of $0.008234 in stage 10, Unstaked gives a rare opening to those seeking high potential returns without the usual risks of speculative tokens.

The analyst still expects XRP to rally to four digits and has in the past explained why he believes such an ambitious price target is possible. XRP Price To Still Rally To $1,000 In an X post, BarriC stated that a potential XRP price rally to between $10 and $20 is just the beginning. He added that the long game for the altcoin is $1,000. The analyst urged market participants to be prepared for life-changing and generational wealth. In his other X posts, BarriC provided a roadmap for how it can reach four digits. Related Reading: Analyst Says These Factors Will Drive XRP Price To $1,000, But What Does Market Cap Say? In one post, he stated that once the XRP price reclaims $3, it will move rapidly to $5. The analyst predicts that the altcoin will then skyrocket into double digits, sitting comfortably at between $10 and $20 as a new all-time high. However, BarriC believes that is just the start for XRP as it will still reach $100 and then $1,000. He asserted that these price targets for XRP will happen much sooner than people think. In another post, the analyst alluded to banks using XRP as one factor that could spark this XRP price surge. BarriC stated that the fact that investors can still accumulate the altcoin at around $2 means that banks aren’t utilizing it yet. The analyst said that once banks and financial institutions worldwide adopt and utilize XRP in the way they conduct finance, the altcoin will skyrocket to $1,000. He referenced the 2017 bull cycle when the token’s price went from $0.006 to $3.80, which is why he is confident that such a parabolic surge is possible. The Altcoin Approaching Key Resistance Levels In an X post, crypto analyst CasiTrades stated that the XRP price is approaching key resistance levels following its latest surge. She highlighted $2.69 as the major resistance, as this price level is also the .236 Fib retracement from the all-time high (ATH) and a key level to watch for a correction. Related Reading: XRP Price To $1,000: Analyst Reveals Target For When Banks Start Using XRP Commenting on the current price action, she noted that what stands out is the continued price increase despite low momentum and a completed 5-wave count. The analyst remarked that this slow, controlled push higher often signals strong underlying demand, strong trend, and heavy accumulation. CasiTrades stated that if the XRP price breaks and holds above $2.69, it would open the door for an explosive move toward $3. However, if the altcoin doesn’t hold this level, she claimed it could record a short-term dip toward $2.30 for a reset. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.50, up almost 5% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

But even Ethereum’s remarkable growth leaves room for other projects to offer exponential returns. Enter Ruvi, the blockchain and AI-powered token that’s disrupting the crypto scene with an upcoming presale boasting unparalleled potential for early investors. Could Ruvi become the next big thing in crypto, offering returns that outperform Ethereum? Here’s everything you need to know. Ethereum’s dominance faces new competition Ethereum’s strengths lie in its vast ecosystem, innovative upgrades like Pectra, and its move to a greener proof-of-stake model. It’s the backbone of decentralized applications (dApps), with a legacy that commands respect. However, with ETH’s price hovering around $2,486.66, the multiplication factor for investors is diminishing. On the other hand, Ruvi combines the power of artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain to solve pressing global issues, from streamlining logistics to refining data analytics, setting itself apart as more than just an alternative to existing cryptocurrencies. And with presale tokens priced at only $0.01, Ruvi is a ground-floor opportunity that promises massive upside. What makes Ruvi stand out? The Ruvi presale is designed for early adopters looking to maximize their gains, with bonus structures that increase returns exponentially based on investment size. Ethereum may have revolutionized the crypto world, but Ruvi’s aggressive approach to incentivize early adoption sets a new standard for ROI potential. Investment scenarios with Ruvi Here’s how Ruvi’s token presale turns modest investments into life-changing wealth. Using conservative future projections between $1 and $3 per token, here are three examples to demonstrate Ruvi’s potential. Entry-level investment ($800) With an $800 investment, you’ll receive 80,000 Ruvi tokens during the presale. Thanks to the 40% bonus, you’ll gain an extra 32,000 tokens, bringing your total to 112,000 tokens. Future Value at $1: $112,000 Future Value at $3: $336,000 Mid-level investment ($1,500) A $1,500 investment nets you 150,000 Ruvi tokens. At this level, the presale adds a 60% bonus, translating into an additional 90,000 tokens, for a grand total of 240,000 tokens. Future Value at $1: $240,000 Future Value at $3: $720,000 High-level investment ($7,000) For more ambitious investors, a $7,000 commitment secures 700,000 Ruvi tokens, doubled by a 100% bonus to reach 1.4 million tokens in total. Future Value at $1: $1,400,000 Future Value at $3: $4,200,000 These figures highlight why Ruvi has been dubbed the most exciting presale in crypto today. Compared to Ethereum’s slower price growth, Ruvi offers an unparalleled potential for both entry-level and high-level investors. Ruvi vs Ethereum: where should you invest? Ethereum may be the backbone of dApps and DeFi, but it’s not immune to competition. Its current price at $2,486.66 makes it less accessible for small-scale investors looking to maximize growth. Meanwhile, Ruvi offers a low-cost entry point with a groundbreaking mix of blockchain and AI utility, ensuring it isn’t just another speculative asset. Where Ethereum focuses on sophisticated infrastructure and institutional adoption, Ruvi provides direct solutions and unparalleled ROI for early adopters. If Ethereum’s evolution has taught us anything, it’s that early movers always win big. And with Ruvi positioned to make waves across multiple industries, now could be the perfect time to ride this rising star. Don’t miss out on Ruvi’s presale The cryptocurrency market rewards those who act fast. Just as Ethereum’s earliest investors saw their modest contributions grow astronomically, Ruvi offers a similar opportunity—but only for those who enter while prices are still low. With tokens at just $0.01 and massive bonuses on the table, Ruvi’s presale is your chance to secure life-changing gains before the price soars. Don’t be the one who looks back in regret; become the investor who seized the opportunity to shape the future of crypto.

44589853,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=160070,1747185003,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Google Gemini Transforms Android Auto Driving Experience,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/google-gemini-android-auto/,"In the rapidly evolving world of technology, where advancements in artificial intelligence are capturing global attention, Google is making a significant move by integrating its cutting-edge Google Gemini generative AI model into vehicles. For many in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, keeping an eye on major tech shifts like this is crucial, as AI infrastructure often intersects with distributed computing and decentralized networks. This integration promises to redefine the in-car experience, making driving more intuitive and connected than ever before. What is Google Gemini Bringing to Android Auto AI? Google recently announced its plans to bring Google Gemini to cars supporting Android Auto within the next few months. This move, revealed ahead of the company’s 2025 I/O developer conference, signifies a major transformation in how drivers interact with their vehicles’ infotainment systems. According to Google, adding Gemini functionality to Android Auto, and later to cars running Google’s built-in operating system, will make driving “more productive and fun.” Patrick Brady, VP of Android for Cars, described this as one of the most significant changes to the in-vehicle experience in a long time. The integration of Android Auto AI powered by Gemini will manifest in two primary ways: Enhanced Voice Assistant: Gemini will serve as a much more capable voice assistant. Users (drivers or passengers) can issue commands for tasks like sending texts, playing music, or getting directions, similar to the existing Google Assistant. However, Gemini’s natural language processing capabilities mean users won’t need rigid, specific commands. They can speak more conversationally. Contextual Understanding: Gemini can retain context and remember user preferences. For instance, it could remember a contact prefers texts in a certain language and handle the translation automatically. Advanced Information Retrieval: A common in-car tech request is finding points of interest along a route. Gemini will excel here, capable of mining Google listings and reviews to answer specific queries, such as finding “taco places with vegan options” nearby. Exploring the Potential of In-car AI with Gemini Live Beyond standard voice commands, Google Gemini will introduce “Gemini Live.” This feature allows the AI to be essentially always listening and ready to engage in more open-ended conversations. This aspect of In-car AI pushes the boundaries of what’s possible: Open Conversations: Users can discuss a wide range of topics, from brainstorming travel ideas for a trip to getting recipe suggestions or even discussing historical facts. Interactive Experience: This moves beyond simple command-response to a more interactive and engaging digital companion within the vehicle. While the idea of an always-listening AI might raise questions about distraction, Google claims Gemini’s natural language abilities will actually reduce cognitive load by making interactions smoother and requiring less mental effort to formulate commands. This is a notable claim in an industry where some users are requesting a return to physical controls over complex touchscreens. Addressing Challenges and Future Possibilities for Generative AI in Vehicles Implementing advanced Generative AI like Gemini in a dynamic environment like a car presents challenges. Initially, Gemini will rely on Google’s cloud processing for both Android Auto and cars with Google Built-In. However, Google is collaborating with automakers to integrate more compute power into vehicles, enabling Gemini to run at the edge. Running AI models locally can improve performance and reliability, crucial factors in a moving vehicle that might experience inconsistent network connectivity. Modern cars also generate vast amounts of data from sensors, cameras, and other systems. The potential for AI in cars to leverage this multimodal data is significant. While Google hasn’t made specific announcements yet, the company acknowledges the potential use cases, particularly with the increasing number of cameras in vehicles. This could lead to future features that are currently only theoretical. Who Gets Google Gemini and When? The rollout of Google Gemini on Android Auto and Google Built-In will extend to all countries where Google’s generative AI model is currently available. The service will support more than 40 languages, ensuring broad accessibility for users worldwide. This integration marks a significant step in bringing sophisticated AI capabilities directly into the daily lives of drivers. As AI technology continues to advance, its presence in commonplace devices like car infotainment systems highlights the broader trend of AI becoming increasingly embedded in our physical world, a trend that has interesting parallels and implications for the development of decentralized technologies and the infrastructure that supports both AI and blockchain. In conclusion, Google’s introduction of Gemini to Android Auto is set to dramatically change the in-car user experience. By providing a more natural, intelligent, and conversational interface, this Android Auto AI aims to make driving more efficient and enjoyable. While challenges related to processing power and data utilization are still being addressed, the potential for future enhancements using vehicle data is substantial. This move underscores the growing importance of Generative AI and In-car AI , pushing the boundaries of what we expect from connected vehicles.

According to analyst Josh, XRP is showing strong signs of a bullish trend right now. A bearish signal that had been hanging over the market for months has finally been invalidated. Since the start of the year, analysts were watching a bearish divergence play out — but now, XRP’s RSI on the 3-day chart has made a higher high. That’s a clear sign the bearish phase is over, and the market can start expecting more positive momentum ahead. XRP Price Analysis: On the daily chart, things look even better. XRP has officially broken out above a key resistance level at around $2.46. This daily candle close above resistance confirms the breakout and signals the start of a new bullish trend. In other words — XRP is no longer stuck in a downtrend and is starting to move upward again. The next important price levels to watch as possible resistance points are $2.60, $2.77, $2.95, $3.15, and $3.30. As for support, the old resistance line at $2.45–$2.46 is now expected to act as a new support zone. Overall, the XRP price chart is flashing bullish signals. The market has cleared out the earlier negative patterns, confirmed a breakout, and regained momentum. If Bitcoin and the broader crypto market also stay bullish, it could give XRP and other altcoins an extra boost in the coming days. Are Sellers Being Absorbed on Binance? XRP futures trading is showing signs of life again, with open interest rising after a sharp drop, hinting at growing trader interest and possible volatility ahead. The market is currently balanced, but short positions are quietly increasing while XRP’s price holds steady — a sign that sellers might be getting absorbed by bigger buyers.

A recent incident in Paris serves as a stark and unwelcome reminder that the risks associated with significant crypto holdings aren’t confined to the digital realm. Physical security is paramount, and a shocking event unfolded that highlights this critical need for enhanced Crypto entrepreneur security . The Alarming Incident: A Look at the Cryptocurrency Kidnapping Attempt Reports emerged detailing a terrifying incident in the heart of Paris, France. According to The Block, a targeted attack occurred aimed at the family of a cryptocurrency entrepreneur. The specific event involved an attempted Cryptocurrency kidnapping . Here’s what we know based on the initial reports: Location: The incident took place in the 11th arrondissement of Paris. Time: The attempt occurred in the morning, around 8:20 a.m. local time. Targets: The masked assailants reportedly attempted to abduct the entrepreneur’s daughter and grandchild. Perpetrators: Three masked men were involved in the attempted abduction. Current Status: Paris police are actively investigating and are said to be hunting for the suspects involved in this disturbing event. This wasn’t a random act; it was a targeted strike, seemingly motivated by the perceived wealth linked to the crypto entrepreneur. It underscores a growing concern within the community: as crypto assets become more valuable and individuals’ holdings grow, they can become targets for physical crime. Why Target Crypto Wealth? Understanding the Motivation Behind Paris Crime Crypto The world of cryptocurrency is often associated with anonymity or pseudonymity, leading some to believe that crypto wealth is untouchable by traditional criminals. However, this incident, and others like it, demonstrate a dangerous reality. Individuals known or believed to possess significant crypto assets can become high-value targets for physical crime, including kidnapping, extortion, and home invasions. Several factors make Crypto wealth security a unique challenge and contribute to incidents like the one seen in Paris: Perceived High Value: Crypto’s rapid price appreciation has created many new millionaires and billionaires, often publicly known or suspected. This visible or rumored wealth attracts criminal attention. Difficulty in Recovery: While blockchain transactions are transparent, tracing funds quickly and recovering them after a forced transfer can be incredibly difficult, making it an attractive target for criminals seeking irreversible gains. Information Leakage: Details about large holdings or successful crypto ventures can sometimes be gleaned from public profiles, social media, or even careless conversations, providing criminals with potential targets. Physical Vulnerability: Unlike digital hacks which require technical skill, physical attacks leverage basic criminal tactics – intimidation, force, and coercion – to gain access to digital assets held by a person. The convergence of significant, potentially hard-to-trace wealth and the physical presence of the asset holder creates a dangerous scenario, contributing to the rise of incidents categorized under Paris crime crypto and similar events globally. Beyond the Headlines: What This Means for Crypto Entrepreneur Security This attempted kidnapping in Paris serves as a grave warning. It’s a reminder that the security strategy for anyone with significant crypto holdings must extend far beyond digital wallets and private keys. Crypto entrepreneur security needs to encompass robust personal and physical security measures. The challenge lies in the fact that while digital security can be managed remotely, physical security requires constant vigilance and proactive measures in the real world. High-profile individuals in the crypto space, or even those simply known within their local community to have done well in crypto, face risks that require professional assessment and planning. Examples of past incidents, ranging from home invasions targeting hardware wallets to physical threats aimed at extorting crypto, highlight that this is not an isolated phenomenon but a growing concern that security experts are increasingly addressing. Actionable Insights: Enhancing Security for Crypto Holders While the Paris incident is unsettling, it provides an opportunity for the community to reassess and strengthen security practices. Enhancing Security for crypto holders involves a multi-layered approach: 1. Bolster Physical Security: Discretion: Be extremely cautious about discussing your crypto holdings or success publicly or even among casual acquaintances. Home Security: Invest in advanced home security systems, including alarms, cameras, reinforced entry points, and potentially safe rooms. Routine Variance: Avoid predictable daily routines that criminals could exploit. Professional Assessment: Consider hiring security consultants to assess your personal risk profile and recommend tailored physical security measures. Travel Safety: Be extra vigilant when traveling, especially to unfamiliar locations. 2. Strengthen Digital Security (Still Crucial): Cold Storage: Store significant amounts of crypto offline using hardware wallets or other cold storage methods. Strong Authentication: Use strong, unique passwords and enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) on all accounts. Beware of Phishing: Be highly skeptical of unsolicited messages or links asking for personal or wallet information. Limit Online Information: Minimize the amount of personal information linked to your crypto activities online. 3. Manage Information Exposure: Social Media: Be mindful of what you post online that could indicate wealth, location, or daily habits. Public Appearances: If you are a public figure in crypto, work with security professionals for events and appearances. Implementing these steps can significantly reduce the risk of becoming a target for physical attacks motivated by crypto wealth. It’s not about living in fear, but about taking sensible precautions in a landscape where digital success can unfortunately create real-world vulnerabilities. The ongoing police hunt in Paris is a critical development, and the community awaits further information regarding the suspects and their potential connection to the victim’s crypto activities. This event serves as a somber reminder that as the crypto world evolves, so too do the methods employed by criminals seeking to exploit it. The safety of individuals and their families must be a top priority. This incident in Paris underscores the urgent need for increased awareness and proactive measures regarding physical security within the crypto community.

44590455,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=160072,1747186251,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shockwave: Abraxas Capital’s Massive $478M Ethereum Purchase Signals Strong Institutional Confidence,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/abraxas-capital-buys-ethereum/,"The world of cryptocurrency often witnesses significant movements, but few grab attention quite like a major institutional player making a substantial investment. Recent reports indicate that asset manager Abraxas Capital has been on an aggressive accumulation spree, particularly focused on Ethereum (ETH). This move, involving hundreds of millions of dollars, is not just a headline; it’s a potential indicator of shifting sentiment and growing confidence among traditional finance giants regarding the digital asset space, specifically concerning Ethereum . What Exactly Did Abraxas Capital Acquire? According to data highlighted by blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain on the social media platform X, Abraxas Capital has significantly increased its holdings of Ethereum over a very short period. The core of the news reveals a staggering acquisition: Over the past six days, Abraxas Capital reportedly purchased a total of 211,030 ETH . At the time of the report, this substantial accumulation was valued at approximately $477.6 million . A notable portion of this came in the last 12 hours preceding the report, with an additional 33,482 ETH acquired, valued at around $84.7 million . This rapid pace of acquisition underscores a deliberate strategy by Abraxas Capital to build a significant position in Ethereum . Such large-scale purchases by institutional entities are often interpreted as bullish signals for the underlying asset and the broader crypto market . Why Are Institutions Like Abraxas Capital Looking at Ethereum? The interest from institutional players in Ethereum is multifaceted. While Bitcoin is often seen as ‘digital gold’ and the primary store of value in the crypto space, Ethereum offers a different value proposition that appeals to sophisticated investors: Foundation of Web3: Ethereum is the leading smart contract platform, serving as the backbone for decentralized finance (DeFi), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps). Investing in ETH is, in essence, investing in the infrastructure of the next generation of the internet. Yield Opportunities: With the transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), Ethereum offers staking rewards. Institutions can earn a yield on their ETH holdings, making it an attractive asset compared to traditional low-yield investments. Network Effect: Ethereum boasts the largest developer community and the most established ecosystem among smart contract platforms. This network effect creates a powerful moat, attracting more users and innovation. Evolving Economics: The implementation of EIP-1559 introduced a burning mechanism for transaction fees, making ETH potentially deflationary under certain network conditions. This scarcity model is appealing to investors. Diversification: For institutions primarily holding Bitcoin or traditional assets, adding Ethereum provides diversification within the digital asset class, capturing exposure to the smart contract and dApp ecosystem. Abraxas Capital ‘s decision to allocate nearly half a billion dollars towards Ethereum suggests a strong conviction in these underlying fundamentals and the long-term growth potential of the network. What Does This Massive Purchase Mean for the Crypto Market and ETH Price? Institutional inflows of this magnitude can have several significant impacts on the crypto market and specifically the ETH price : Potential Impact Area Explanation Increased Demand Large purchases directly increase demand for ETH, potentially pushing the price upwards, especially if supply on exchanges is limited. Market Confidence Significant buys by known entities like Abraxas Capital signal validation to other investors, potentially encouraging further institutional and retail participation. Liquidity Dynamics As institutions accumulate and potentially move assets off exchanges for long-term holding or staking, it can reduce available supply for trading, impacting market liquidity. Price Stability (Potentially) Institutional holders often have longer time horizons than retail traders, which could contribute to more stable price action in the long run, although volatility remains inherent in the crypto market . Narrative Building These events reinforce the narrative of institutional adoption, which is a key driver for broader market growth and regulatory clarity. While a single purchase, even a large one, doesn’t guarantee a sustained price increase, it adds significant buying pressure and contributes positively to the overall market sentiment surrounding Ethereum and the viability of the crypto market for large-scale investment. Are There Challenges or Risks Associated with Such Large Institutional Bets? Investing in cryptocurrency, even for experienced asset managers like Abraxas Capital , comes with inherent risks and challenges: Market Volatility: The crypto market is known for its extreme price swings. A nearly $500 million position is subject to significant fluctuations, potentially leading to substantial unrealized gains or losses in short periods. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Changes in regulations could impact the usability, legality, or tax treatment of Ethereum holdings. Security Risks: Holding large amounts of digital assets requires robust security measures to protect against hacks, theft, or loss of private keys. Institutions must employ sophisticated custody solutions. Execution Risk: Acquiring such a large amount of ETH without significantly moving the market requires careful execution, often utilizing over-the-counter (OTC) desks rather than public exchanges. Liquidity for Exit: While the market is liquid, exiting a position of this size without impacting the ETH price could also present challenges. Abraxas Capital , as a professional asset manager, is undoubtedly aware of these risks and likely has strategies in place to mitigate them. Their willingness to proceed with such a large investment suggests they believe the potential rewards outweigh these challenges. Looking Ahead: What Could This Mean for the Future of Ethereum? The move by Abraxas Capital is more than just a snapshot in time; it’s a data point contributing to a larger trend of increasing institutional interest in Ethereum . If more asset managers follow suit, the implications could be profound: Increased Stability: Greater institutional participation could potentially lead to a more mature and stable market over time, as large holders are less likely to engage in panic selling. Further Innovation: Institutional capital flowing into the ecosystem can help fund development and innovation within the Ethereum network and its associated dApps. Regulatory Clarity: As more established financial players enter the space, it increases the pressure on regulators to provide clear guidelines, which can benefit the entire crypto market . Mainstream Adoption: Institutional adoption paves the way for easier access and understanding for mainstream investors and corporations. The long-term ETH price trajectory will depend on a confluence of factors, including network development, regulatory environment, macroeconomic conditions, and continued adoption. However, significant institutional accumulation like that seen from Abraxas Capital is undoubtedly a positive sign for the asset’s future prospects. Conclusion: A Bullish Signal from a Big Player Abraxas Capital ‘s reported acquisition of 211,030 ETH, valued at nearly $478 million, over just six days is a powerful statement. It highlights growing institutional conviction in Ethereum as a core digital asset, separate from or alongside Bitcoin. This significant capital inflow provides a strong vote of confidence in the network’s technology, ecosystem, and future potential. While the crypto market remains volatile and subject to various influences, moves of this scale from established asset managers are key indicators of the ongoing maturation and increasing acceptance of digital assets within traditional finance. Investors and enthusiasts alike will be watching closely to see how this trend develops and its ultimate impact on the ETH price and the broader market.

44591099,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=160075,1747187445,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Tencent Secures Controversial Microsoft AI Team WizardLM,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/tencent-hires-microsoft-wizardlm/,"In a significant development within the artificial intelligence landscape, Chinese tech giant Tencent appears to have onboarded the WizardLM team, a group of AI researchers previously associated with Microsoft. This move is particularly noteworthy given WizardLM’s recent history and highlights the intense competition for top AI talent and technology. Tencent’s Strategic Move in AI Tencent, the powerhouse behind platforms like WeChat and popular games including PUBG Mobile, is making aggressive strides in artificial intelligence. The company’s AI development organization, Hunyuan, is reportedly the new home for the WizardLM researchers. This strategic acquisition underscores Tencent’s commitment to bolstering its AI capabilities and accelerating its model development efforts. Can Xu, a senior AI researcher who played a leading role in several WizardLM projects, announced the team’s departure from Microsoft to join Tencent’s Hunyuan group via a post on X. Understanding WizardLM’s Past at Microsoft AI The WizardLM team, which originated several years ago, has a somewhat unusual past, particularly during its time under the Microsoft AI umbrella. In April 2024, the team released the WizardLM-2 family of AI models, which they claimed were competitive with leading models like OpenAI’s GPT-4. However, these models were quickly pulled from public access by Microsoft after just one day. The reason cited was a missed step in the release process: toxicity testing. The team acknowledged this oversight on X, stating they were completing the testing and planned to re-release the models soon. The Fallout from WizardLM-2’s Removal Despite Microsoft’s swift action, users had already downloaded and reuploaded the original WizardLM-2 models, along with customized versions. The sudden removal also caused disruption within the open-source AI community. Hugging Face CEO Clément Delangue noted that the deletion of WizardLM models, which were downloaded hundreds of thousands of times monthly, harmed numerous open-source projects dependent on them. This incident highlighted the complexities and responsibilities involved in releasing powerful AI models, even for established tech giants like Microsoft. Tencent’s Growing Hunyuan AI Power With the integration of the WizardLM team, Tencent’s Hunyuan AI efforts are expected to gain further momentum. Hunyuan has recently launched various AI models, including generators for video and 3D objects. The collaboration has already yielded results, with the release of the Hunyuan-TurboS 0416 model. Qingfeng Sun, identifying as a “co-founder” of WizardLM, has claimed that Hunyuan-TurboS 0416 surpasses certain “open” AI models, specifically mentioning Google’s Gemma 3 series, in performance. This suggests that the WizardLM team is continuing its focus on developing high-performing AI models within its new environment. Tencent has significantly increased its investment in AI infrastructure and recently restructured the Hunyuan team into two new units. The company attributed an 8% year-over-year growth in Q1 2025 partly to its AI investments. Tencent plans substantial capital expenditures this year, approximately 90 billion yuan (around $12.49 billion), with a significant portion allocated to fuel its AI ambitions. The addition of the WizardLM team aligns with this aggressive investment strategy aimed at strengthening Tencent’s position in the global AI race. Implications for the Future of AI Models The acquisition of a skilled team like WizardLM by Tencent signifies the ongoing talent war in the AI sector. While the exact number of researchers moving to Tencent is unclear, the integration of their expertise into the Hunyuan platform is likely to accelerate the development of new AI models. The competition between major players like Tencent, Microsoft, Google, and others continues to drive innovation. The rapid release and comparison of models like Hunyuan-TurboS 0416 against competitors underscore the fast-paced nature of this field. The move also raises questions about the future direction of open-source contributions from teams previously associated with large corporations and the balance between rapid development and responsible deployment, as highlighted by the WizardLM-2 incident. In conclusion, Tencent’s reported hiring of the WizardLM team from Microsoft is a major development that strengthens its Hunyuan AI division. Despite WizardLM’s controversial history surrounding the release and subsequent withdrawal of its models at Microsoft, the team’s expertise is now set to contribute to Tencent’s ambitious AI goals. This move highlights the intense competition for AI talent and resources, promising further advancements and shifts in the landscape of AI model development.

He also announced that Coinbase is investing an undisclosed sum in it to increase access to tokenized Canadian dollars at the Blockchain Futurist Conference in Toronto. According to Matheson, they requested the federal government create a national digital assets strategy. Based on his argument, crypto is strategic; therefore, they hoped the new administration would recognize the strategic importance of cryptocurrency. This followed the April federal elections in Canada, which resulted in the election of Prime Minister Mark Carney, who had previously expressed disapproval of cryptocurrencies. Matheson highlights the necessity of a stablecoin for the Canadian market In an exclusive interview on May 13, Matheson acknowledged the existence of a stablecoin for Canadians as crucial. He further stated that stablecoins are particularly necessary because the nation has “no peer-to-peer [payment] rail” and “wire transfers cost $45 and take 45 minutes of paperwork.” Moreover, he claimed that stablecoins make it possible to make 24/7, instantaneous, borderless payments, which was already possible with current technology. According to Stablecorp’s website, the most recent report on QCAD’s fiat reserve backing was from July 2024, when there was only about $175,000 worth of QCAD in circulation. On the other hand, the US dollar-backed stablecoins Tether and USDC make up the majority of the stablecoins’ $245 billion market capitalization as of May 13, according to CoinGecko data. In light of these variations in the stablecoins, Matheson emphasized the need for a stablecoin created especially for the Canadian market to solve present problems with the payment infrastructure. In addition, Coinbase stated in a blog post on March 26 that Canada lacked a clear path for stablecoin adoption , partly because its government has not yet removed securities regulation barriers for fiat-backed stablecoins. The exchange further stated that it must start considering instruments instead of securities. Meanwhile, according to the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s April statement, if stablecoins were only promoted to make payments, they are not considered securities in the country. Canadian voters expressed their strong desire for a digital assets strategy during the April election According to WonderFi CEO and President Dean Skurka, Canadian voters demonstrated that they wanted the government to take action on cryptocurrency when they cast their ballots on April 28. Based on his argument, this could be achieved if policymakers followed the United States and Europe in fostering an environment more conducive to blockchain development. Additionally, that month, Canadians eagerly awaited the political leaders’ plans regarding digital assets as the country’s federal election approached. This resulted from millions of Canadians owning, using, or working in cryptocurrency, which was becoming an increasingly important area for innovation and economic growth. Most of this active base was under 50, making them a powerful political force. The election and the administration had an opportunity for policymakers to encourage voters’ desire for clarity regarding Canada’s digital future. In 2022, Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre gained popularity when he supported Bitcoin and decentralized finance, giving people more control over their finances and, therefore, less control over politicians and banks. He aimed to make Canada the world’s blockchain capital and for its people to embrace digital currencies such as Bitcoin to escape inflation. While he is a fan of digital innovation, Mark Carney, a former governor of the Bank of Canada affiliated with the Liberal Party, has yet to be persuaded that digital coins such as stablecoins will upend the monetary system. He has argued that digital currency would have a more solid and secure foundation because of central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs He said stablecoins were not a revolutionary alternative to the traditional monetary system but merely an extension. Carney stated that CBDCs would form the basis of a more stable, programmable financial future and lower the risks associated with digital currency.

The focus? The Federal Reserve and the possibility of an Interest Rate Cut . Understanding the Trump Fed Pressure Donald Trump has a history of expressing strong opinions regarding the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy, particularly its benchmark interest rate. His recent remarks on Truth Social continue this trend, directly urging the Fed to lower rates again. This isn’t just a casual suggestion; it’s a pointed commentary aimed at influencing the independent central bank’s decisions. Why is Trump pushing for this now? He points to what he sees as falling prices in the U.S., arguing that this indicates a lack of inflation. His logic is straightforward: if prices aren’t rising, or are even declining, then the primary reason the Fed might keep rates high (controlling inflation) isn’t valid. He contrasts the U.S. situation with that of Europe and China, which have pursued lower interest rate policies, suggesting the U.S. should follow suit to remain competitive or stimulate growth. Key Argument: Falling prices negate the need for high rates. Comparative Stance: U.S. should align with lower rates seen in Europe and China. Underlying Goal: Likely aims to stimulate economic activity. Why the Call for an Interest Rate Cut ? Examining the Logic An Interest Rate Cut by the Federal Reserve typically serves to make borrowing money cheaper for businesses and consumers. This can encourage spending and investment, potentially boosting economic growth. Trump’s argument hinges on the idea that the current economic climate, characterized by his perception of falling prices and lack of inflation, warrants such stimulus rather than restrictive monetary policy. However, the Fed’s perspective is often more nuanced. They look at a wide range of economic indicators, including employment data, wage growth, consumer spending, and crucially, various measures of Inflation Data . While some specific prices might fall, the overall inflation picture, according to official metrics like the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, is what the Fed primarily monitors to achieve its dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices. Comparing the U.S. to Europe and China is also complex. Each economy faces unique challenges and operates under different structures. While lower rates might be appropriate for their specific conditions, the Fed must set policy based on the health and outlook of the US Economy . The Current State of the US Economy and the Fed’s Stance The Federal Reserve operates independently of political pressure, though it is accountable to Congress. Its decisions on interest rates are made by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) based on extensive economic analysis. In recent times, the Fed aggressively raised rates to combat inflation that surged after the pandemic. More recently, they have paused rate hikes, signaling a data-dependent approach. The current state of the US Economy is subject to various interpretations. While the labor market has remained relatively strong, there are ongoing debates about the pace of inflation reduction, the impact of higher rates on different sectors, and the potential for a future slowdown. The Fed has repeatedly stated it wants to see clear evidence that inflation is sustainably moving towards its 2% target before considering rate cuts. Challenges the Fed faces include: Balancing inflation control with supporting economic growth. Navigating global economic uncertainties. Maintaining credibility and independence from political influence, like the Trump Fed Pressure . Interpreting conflicting economic signals (e.g., strong jobs vs. potential manufacturing slowdown). Potential Crypto Market Impact of Rate Decisions So, why should cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors pay attention to this debate over an Interest Rate Cut ? Because monetary policy decisions by the Fed can have a significant Crypto Market Impact . Here’s a simplified look at the connection: Lower Interest Rates: Make traditional, safer investments (like bonds or savings accounts) less attractive due to lower returns. Can lead investors to seek higher returns in riskier assets. Increase liquidity in the financial system, making capital more available. Can potentially benefit risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies, as investors might allocate more capital to them in search of yield or growth. Higher Interest Rates (or maintaining high rates): Make traditional assets more attractive, drawing capital away from riskier investments. Reduce liquidity as borrowing becomes more expensive. Can put downward pressure on assets perceived as speculative, including cryptocurrencies. Therefore, the prospect of an Interest Rate Cut , especially if it signals a shift towards easier monetary policy, is often viewed positively by the crypto market. Conversely, the Fed maintaining higher rates, or even the threat of future hikes (though less likely now), can be seen as a headwind. What About Inflation Data and its Role? Trump’s argument heavily relies on his interpretation of falling prices and lack of Inflation Data . However, the Fed looks at a broader, more official set of statistics. While some goods might see price declines, the services sector and wages have shown more persistence in inflation. The Fed’s decisions are heavily weighted by whether they believe inflation is truly under control and moving towards their target. If the official Inflation Data remains sticky, the Fed will be hesitant to cut rates, regardless of political calls like the Trump Fed Pressure . A premature cut could risk reigniting inflationary pressures, forcing the Fed to potentially hike rates again later, which would likely be disruptive for the US Economy and financial markets, including potentially a negative Crypto Market Impact . Actionable Insights for Crypto Watchers Given the potential Crypto Market Impact , what should you watch? Fed Meetings: Pay close attention to FOMC meeting announcements and press conferences. Listen for clues about their outlook on inflation, employment, and future rate plans. Economic Data: Monitor key economic releases, especially official Inflation Data (CPI, PCE), jobs reports, and GDP growth. These are the metrics guiding the Fed. Political Commentary: While not directly controlling the Fed, political pressure like the Trump Fed Pressure can add noise and sometimes signal broader political priorities regarding the US Economy . Market Reactions: Observe how the crypto market reacts immediately following Fed announcements and major economic data releases. Conclusion: Navigating the Economic Winds Donald Trump’s renewed calls for an Interest Rate Cut highlight the ongoing debate about the direction of the US Economy and the appropriate stance for the Federal Reserve. While his arguments center on falling prices and comparison to other global economies, the Fed’s decision-making process is guided by a broader set of official Inflation Data and economic indicators, striving for price stability and maximum employment. For those interested in the potential Crypto Market Impact , understanding the dynamics between monetary policy, inflation, and economic growth is crucial. An Interest Rate Cut could potentially serve as a tailwind for risk assets like cryptocurrencies, but the timing and context of such a move are paramount. The ongoing Trump Fed Pressure adds a political layer to an already complex economic picture. Ultimately, the Fed will make its decision based on the data, but the public discussion, fueled by figures like Trump, keeps the spotlight firmly on the critical role of interest rates in the global financial landscape.

The IPO raised about $310 million, with the company and existing investors selling nearly six million shares . With that, eToro has been valued at around $4.2 billion in a successful debut on the public markets in a cautiously optimistic period for tech IPOs. EToro said in its prospectus that BlackRock had expressed interest in buying $100 million shares at the IPO price. The company planned to sell 5 million shares in the offering, with existing investors and executives selling another 5 million. Crypto boom drives eToro’s $50M profit surge eToro had the financial footing to ease its path to a successful IPO. In 2024, the company said, net income surged to $192.4 million from $15.3 million. This growth reflected the platform’s rising interest in cryptocurrency and the active participation of users worldwide. The company has been ramping up its crypto business, with revenue from crypto assets more than tripling to over $12 million in 2024. One-quarter of its net trading contribution last year came from crypto, up from 10% the prior year. eToro generates revenue from trading fees through spreads on buy and sell orders and from non-trading services, like currency conversions and withdrawal fees. It competes with other upstart retail trading platforms, including Robinhood and Webull, in offering traditional stock trading and access to crypto assets. By December 2024, the company had 3.5 million funded accounts from more than 75 countries, which showed a growing international momentum. eToro revives investor confidence with strong IPO The timing of eToro’s public offering could not be better. The IPO market stopped in recent years but has shown signs of life. The return of President Donald Trump to the White House in January 2025 and the stabilization of interest rates and decline in inflation have breathed new life into the public offerings market. Earlier in the year, GPU cloud infrastructure company CoreWeave went public with a successful debut, opening the door for companies like eToro, Klarna, and StubHub to dip their toes. Temporary fears over tariffs had delayed their plans, but eToro moved ahead after market confidence started to return. This is not eToro’s first try at going public. It had intended to merge with a special-purpose acquisition vehicle, or SPAC, in a deal that would have valued the business at more than $10 billion by 2022. But that plan was grounded by a larger market slide. Yoni Assia, the chief executive and a co-founder of the company, which was founded in 2007 with his brother Ronen Assia and David Ring, said earlier in 2024 that they were continuing to ready the company for a public debut, “assessing the right opportunity.” Now officially listed on the Nasdaq, eToro is set to drive a paradigm shift in how ordinary people trade, invest, and participate in financial markets. The success of eToro’s IPO is now increasingly being closely followed as a litmus test for the pipeline of tech and fintech IPOs, with companies like Hinge Health and Chime next in line to do so.

All three victims suffered injuries and were taken to a local hospital. Local outlet Le Parisien reported that the botched daylight kidnapping is being investigated by the Brigade for the Suppression of Banditry, a special police unit of the French Ministry of the Interior. Michael Englander, co-founder and CEO of Polish crypto exchange Plasbit , says this incident should serve as a wake-up call for the rest of the industry. “If you’re in crypto and still flaunting it online, you’re not just stupid, you’re putting your family in danger,” he said in a May 13 post to X. Offline crypto-linked attacks grow Crypto-focused lawyer Sasha Hodder said on X that “crypto theft is evolving. It’s not just social engineering or SIM swaps anymore.” In May, Las Vegas police said three teenagers had allegedly kidnapped a man at gunpoint who was returning from a local crypto event and robbed him of $4 million in crypto and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). On May 3, Paris police freed the father of a crypto entrepreneur who was held for several days in connection with a 7 million euro ($7.8 million) kidnapping plot. At the start of the year, David Balland, co-founder of crypto hardware wallet manufacturer Ledger, was abducted from his home in central France during the early hours of Jan. 21. He was held captive until a police operation on the night of Jan. 22 secured his release.

44591629,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=160084,1747188639,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,SEC Solana ETF Decision: Uncertainty Lingers After Delay,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-solana-etf-delay/,"The world of cryptocurrency ETFs is buzzing, but not always with good news. The latest development stirring the pot involves a potential new player: Solana. Specifically, Grayscale’s ambitious proposal for a Spot Solana ETF has hit a temporary roadblock. According to reports, the SEC Solana ETF decision timeline has been pushed back. This news, initially shared by Unfolded on X, indicates that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) needs more time to deliberate on Grayscale’s application. For many watching the space, this Solana ETF delay isn’t entirely surprising, given the SEC’s cautious approach to new crypto products, especially those beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Understanding the Grayscale Solana ETF Proposal Grayscale is a familiar name in the crypto investment landscape, known for its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which recently converted into a spot Bitcoin ETF. Building on that success and the growing interest in alternative cryptocurrencies, Grayscale proposed a spot ETF that would hold Solana (SOL) directly. A spot ETF allows investors to gain exposure to the price movements of an underlying asset without directly owning the asset itself. For a Grayscale Solana ETF , this would mean the fund holds actual SOL tokens, and investors buy shares in the fund. This structure is often preferred by traditional investors and institutions as it fits within existing regulatory frameworks and investment platforms. The potential benefits of such a product are significant: Increased Accessibility: Makes investing in Solana easier for traditional investors. Enhanced Liquidity: Could bring more capital into the Solana ecosystem. Regulatory Clarity: An approved ETF provides a level of legitimacy and regulatory comfort. Institutional Adoption: Opens the door for large institutions to invest in Solana. However, getting any crypto ETF approved, especially for an altcoin like Solana, is a complex process subject to stringent crypto ETF regulation . Why the SEC Decision Delay? The SEC’s primary mandate is investor protection. When considering a new financial product like a Spot Solana ETF, they scrutinize various factors. A SEC decision delay typically signals that the commission requires additional time to review the application thoroughly, gather more information, or address specific concerns. Potential reasons for this delay could include: Market Surveillance and Manipulation Concerns: The SEC needs to be confident that the underlying market for Solana is resistant to manipulation. While the Bitcoin market is large and has established surveillance sharing agreements (particularly with the CME futures market), the SEC might have different or additional questions regarding the Solana spot market structure, liquidity, and trading venues. Solana’s Unique Characteristics: Unlike Bitcoin, Solana utilizes a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism and has different network dynamics. The SEC may be evaluating the implications of these technical differences from a regulatory standpoint. Precedent Setting: Approving a Spot Solana ETF would set a significant precedent for other altcoin ETFs. The SEC might be cautious about opening the floodgates to a wide array of single-asset altcoin ETFs without a clear framework or criteria. Application Complexity: ETF applications are detailed documents. The SEC might have questions about the fund’s structure, custody arrangements for the SOL tokens, valuation methods, and risk disclosures. Workload and Priorities: The SEC handles numerous filings across various financial sectors. Delays can sometimes simply be a matter of managing a heavy workload and prioritizing reviews. What Does This Solana ETF Delay Mean for the Market? A Solana ETF delay introduces a period of uncertainty. While not an outright rejection, it pushes back the timeline for potential institutional investment and broader market access that an ETF could provide. Market reactions to such delays can vary, but often involve a temporary dip in asset price due to reduced immediate optimism, or simply sideways movement as participants await further clarity. For Solana specifically, the delay means the potential price catalyst of a spot ETF approval is now further out. Investors and traders who were anticipating a quick decision based on the pace of Bitcoin ETF approvals will need to adjust their expectations. The focus now shifts back to Solana’s fundamentals, network development, and the broader crypto market sentiment while the regulatory process unfolds. This situation also highlights the ongoing challenges in crypto ETF regulation . Each new asset class presents unique questions for regulators, and the path to mainstream financial products like ETFs is often slow and deliberate. The outcome of the SEC Solana ETF decision will be closely watched not just for Solana, but for its implications for other altcoins seeking similar investment vehicles. Challenges and Opportunities in Crypto ETF Regulation The regulatory path for crypto ETFs is fraught with challenges. The SEC has historically expressed concerns about market volatility, potential for manipulation, and investor protection in the crypto space. While the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs marked a significant turning point, it doesn’t automatically pave the way for all other cryptocurrencies. Challenges: Establishing robust surveillance mechanisms for diverse crypto markets. Determining which assets meet the SEC’s criteria for being suitable for a spot ETF. Addressing custody and security risks associated with holding various digital assets. Navigating the evolving legal and regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies globally. Opportunities: Increased clarity from regulatory bodies can foster innovation and investment. Approved ETFs can provide safer, more familiar investment avenues for a wider audience. The process pushes for greater maturity and transparency in crypto markets. Successful frameworks for one asset can potentially be adapted for others. The SEC decision delay on the Grayscale Solana ETF is a clear indicator that the regulatory journey for altcoin ETFs is far from over and will likely involve careful, step-by-step evaluations. Actionable Insights for Investors Given the uncertainty introduced by the Solana ETF delay , what should investors consider? Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on official announcements from the SEC and updates from Grayscale. The reasons for the delay and the new deadline will provide crucial context. Focus on Fundamentals: While regulatory news impacts price, the long-term value of Solana depends on its technology, adoption, developer activity, and ecosystem growth. Evaluate these factors independently of ETF speculation. Manage Expectations: Understand that the path to a Spot Solana ETF approval may be lengthy and involve further delays or even potential rejection. Don’t base investment decisions solely on the assumption of imminent ETF approval. Consider Diversification: Don’t place all your bets on a single asset or a single catalyst like an ETF approval. Diversify your crypto holdings based on your risk tolerance and research. Understand Regulatory Risk: Recognize that regulatory decisions, including those related to crypto ETF regulation , are a significant factor influencing the crypto market. The SEC decision delay is part of the standard regulatory process, but it underscores the ongoing scrutiny faced by the crypto industry as it seeks to integrate with traditional finance. Conclusion: A Waiting Game Continues The SEC’s decision to delay its ruling on the Grayscale Solana ETF application extends the period of anticipation for the Solana community and the broader crypto market. While not a definitive setback, it highlights the regulatory hurdles that remain for cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum seeking mainstream investment products like spot ETFs. The reasons behind the SEC decision delay likely revolve around a thorough examination of the Solana market’s structure, potential for manipulation, and the implications of setting a precedent for altcoin ETFs under existing crypto ETF regulation . The outcome of this review will be a critical moment for Solana and will provide further insight into the SEC’s approach to regulating the evolving digital asset landscape. For now, it’s a waiting game. The market will continue to operate based on existing factors, with the potential boost from a spot Solana ETF pushed further into the future. The focus remains on fundamental developments within the Solana ecosystem and the ongoing dialogue between innovators like Grayscale and regulators like the SEC.

This capital infusion marks one of the strongest waves of professional crypto adoption seen in recent quarters. The trend signals rising confidence among institutional buyers in the long-term value of digital assets, suggesting renewed momentum in both price performance and network fundamentals.While many established tokens have surged in value amid this backdrop, emerging platforms like Qubetics ($TICS) are gaining traction for a different reason. Unlike earlier projects that faced technical limitations, Qubetics is purpose-built for scalable, enterprise-grade utility. Its architecture addresses the operational challenges businesses and professionals face in cross-border communications, privacy, and finance. This is why Qubetics has rapidly become one of the best crypto to buy right now , alongside breakout performers like SUI and Cosmos (ATOM). Much of this fresh capital has flowed into projects with proven utility and high scalability potential. Participants are targeting ecosystems that can solve real-world problems, rather than speculative tokens with short-term hype. This changing capital behavior mirrors the maturation of the asset class—where interoperability, infrastructure, and enterprise adoption are now top considerations. Qubetics ($TICS): A Decentralized VPN and Scalable Infrastructure for Professionals Qubetics is transforming how digital privacy, global business operations, and decentralized communication are handled at scale. At the heart of its offering lies a Decentralized VPN designed to serve individuals, startups, and enterprise clients alike. This secure networking solution eliminates centralized choke points and intermediaries—allowing users to exchange information and assets in real time, across borders, with full sovereignty over their data. For businesses and professionals navigating a fragmented digital landscape, the Qubetics VPN provides low-latency performance, jurisdiction-agnostic access, and unmatched reliability. Whether it’s remote legal teams transferring contracts, cross-border payment processing, or data-sensitive collaboration between institutions, Qubetics addresses the trust gap that still hinders digital transformation globally. Beyond secure connectivity, Qubetics enables seamless integration of tokenized assets and digital services through its advanced interoperability layer. The platform’s architecture supports high throughput, low transaction costs, and customizable governance—key traits for builders and backers seeking future-ready blockchain infrastructure. Qubetics Presale Highlights and ROI Opportunity The Qubetics crypto presale is now in its 34th stage, having already sold more than 512 million tokens to a community of 26,300+ holders. Over $16.9 million has been raised so far, and $TICS tokens are priced at $0.2532 in the current round. For those who act now, entry remains viable with significant upside still in play. Early adopters from Stage 1—who secured $TICS at just $0.01—are now seeing a 2,432% return. Yet participants entering today can still secure an impressive 294% ROI if $TICS hits $1 after the presale. At $5, returns jump to 1,874%, while $6 yields 2,269%. If the token reaches $10 post-mainnet, community members could realize 3,848% gains. Should it soar to $15, the potential ROI hits an exceptional 5,822%. The presale is ongoing, and access remains open. For those seeking the best crypto to buy right now with actual enterprise application, Qubetics is a front-runner with a practical edge. SUI: Breaking Into the Top 11 with High-Volume Momentum SUI has made headlines by climbing to $4.15, marking its highest valuation since January and representing a staggering 1,040% gain from its 2024 low. This ascent has propelled SUI into the top 11 cryptocurrencies, ahead of well-known names like Chainlink, Avalanche, Stellar, and Hedera. From a technical standpoint, SUI is in the final phase of an Elliott Wave impulse pattern, indicating that the current rally could either top out soon or extend further—especially if market euphoria intensifies. The next resistance level to monitor is the all-time high at $5.33. A confirmed move above this threshold could attract widespread attention, especially from retail participants and trading platforms. SUI’s bullish case is supported by strong fundamentals, rapid transaction speeds, and increased developer interest. It is becoming an infrastructure-layer candidate for gaming, tokenization, and consumer Web3 use cases. SUI’s position as one of the best crypto to buy right now is supported by both price strength and its strategic positioning in digital scalability. With momentum intact and bullish chart formations in play, SUI offers breakout potential in the current cycle. Cosmos (ATOM): Interoperability Champion Regains Market Relevance Cosmos is one of the most technically advanced interoperability platforms on the market. As of mid-May 2025, ATOM is trading at $5.09, supported by a $1.99 billion market cap. With a circulating supply of 390.9 million tokens, Cosmos continues to serve as the foundation for interchain communication and modular blockchain design. Its key innovation, the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, allows independent blockchains to exchange data and value in a trustless manner. Cosmos also offers a developer-friendly toolkit for building sovereign, application-specific blockchains that plug into a broader ecosystem. This makes it ideal for scaling decentralized finance, gaming, and cross-chain governance solutions. ATOM has gained 19.42% in the past 30 days, signaling renewed attention from both retail buyers and institutional participants. As Web3 ecosystems demand better composability and scalability, Cosmos stands out as a core infrastructure player with staying power. Cosmos delivers real-world interoperability at scale, backed by consistent network growth. Its modular architecture makes it one of the best crypto to buy right now for those prioritizing multichain futures and blockchain composability. Final Thoughts The injection of $882 million in institutional capital has changed the tempo of the market. Rather than chasing speculative trends, professional buyers are locking into platforms that show scalability, usability, and long-term real-world alignment. Qubetics leads this new wave by merging decentralized infrastructure with practical tools like VPN access, cross-border transactions, and enterprise integrations. SUI has entered the high-cap league with parabolic growth backed by structured patterns and fundamental support. Cosmos reinforces its value through cross-chain communication and network modularity. Each project offers a unique entry point based on its current market positioning and adoption curve. But access is not infinite. With the Qubetics presale still live and rapidly advancing, now is a strategic time to engage with platforms that are building blockchain’s future—not just chasing its past.

For many, that regret is all too real. From DOGE to SHIB, early backers turned a few hundred bucks into life-changing wealth. But here’s the kicker: the next tidal wave is already swelling. Meme coins are resurging—faster, funnier, and fiercer than ever. In the middle of this storm stands BTFD Coin (BTFD) , a blazing-hot new project with a presale that’s igniting serious whale interest. With less than 15 days left until the presale ends on May 26, and analysts throwing around a bold $0.006 moon prediction, investors are scrambling to grab their stake before the window slams shut. This article explores the best meme coins to invest in now, featuring BTFD front and center alongside viral meme contenders that still have fuel in the tank. Let’s dive in while there’s still time to act. 1. BTFD Coin (BTFD) — The Final Dip Before 8900% Liftoff?

Sitting in Stage 15 of its presale at just $0.0002, BTFD is handing out presale deals that are hard to ignore. Over $6.81 million has already been raised. More than 73 billion tokens have been sold to 12,100+ holders. And there’s only one stage left before the explosive May 27 launch. Investors dropping $4500 at this stage grab 22.5 million $BTFD tokens. Apply the LAUNCH200 code , and those tokens triple to 67.5 million. If BTFD hits its projected listing price of $0.0006, that $4500 becomes $40,500. If it moons to $0.006 as predicted? You’re staring at over $400K. But here’s where it gets juicier: staking rewards are live with a 90% APY, and the Bulls Squad P2E game is fully playable—letting users earn as they play. And the hype isn’t just retail-driven. Big buys are starting to flood in. With meme coin whales joining the herd, the BTFD presale is shifting into high gear. This meme coin presale isn’t just another gamble—it’s the best-priced ticket into a bullish ecosystem that rewards early adopters with real utility, community, and monster returns. Why is BTFD among the best meme coins to invest in now? Because it’s one of the only coins giving investors triple tokens, staking rewards, and an 8900% ROI target—and it’s almost over. 2. Floki Inu (FLOKI) — The Viking of Hype Floki Inu continues to ride high on branding, community loyalty, and major marketing pushes. The team has invested heavily in partnerships and ecosystem development, from DeFi to metaverse integrations. It’s seen renewed interest thanks to increased token burns and bullish sentiment on DEXs.

Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) — Divine Degens Unite GOAT is the cult-favorite that mixes divine meme lore with on-chain chaos. Their recent campaign, “Sacrifice for Gains,” brought massive user traction. A quirky staking dashboard and comic-style roadmap give it that degen charm investors can’t ignore. Why did GOAT earn a spot? Because it’s weird, wild, and weirdly winning in all the right communities. 5. Brett (BRETT) — Still Got It Based on the Chad meme, BRETT offers a blend of alpha-male memetics and solid tokenomics. It made headlines after a recent DeFi bridge launch, increasing its on-chain usability. Despite volatility, the Brett Army remains loyal—and loud. Why is Brett here? Because in this market, recognizable memes with loyal fans stay relevant longer. 6. WHY (WHY) — Existential Goldmine WHY takes a nihilistic spin on meme investing. Its whitepaper is just “WHY NOT?” and that’s the joke—but the project has smart contract security and quirky NFT missions that keep its audience hooked. It’s proof that humor and hype still drive volume. Why did WHY make this list of the best meme coins to invest in now? Because sometimes nonsense makes more sense in meme coin season.

At the time of writing, BTC trades at $104,271, narrowing the gap to its all-time high of $109,000. This recent price surge is not occurring in isolation. Instead, it appears closely tied to broader macroeconomic developments, most notably, the recent easing of trade tensions between the US and China, with both countries reducing tariffs on certain imports and exports. Market participants have responded positively to these policy shifts, signaling renewed risk appetite across traditional and digital asset markets. Bitcoin’s rally over the weekend reflects this optimism, with analysts identifying key technical indicators pointing toward rising buyer strength. One such indicator, the Taker Buy Sell Ratio, is gaining attention for marking previous turning points in Bitcoin’s price history. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears All-Time High as $312M BTC Exit Binance Following US-China Trade Deal Bitcoin Taker Buy-Sell Ratio Signals Renewed Bullish Control CryptoQuant contributor G a a h highlighted that the Taker Buy Sell Ratio, a metric measuring the ratio of market buy orders to sell orders, has climbed to a significant threshold of 1.02. Historically, similar levels have coincided with crucial inflection points in Bitcoin’s price movement. For instance, this metric reached comparable highs during the late 2022 lows between $15,000 and $20,000, and again in October 2023 as Bitcoin broke through the $30,000 resistance level. According to G a a h, this recent breakout above the 1.00 line reflects an increase in aggressive buying activity, with market takers once again asserting short-term control. This suggests upward momentum may persist in the near term. However, the analyst also cautioned that these same conditions have previously been followed by volatility spikes, marking both the start and reversal of market trends. The analyst wrote: It’s worth noting that in previous periods, this same level has coincided with reversal zones or strong volatility, marking both the start and end of trends. We are therefore facing a scenario where buyer appetite could continue to drive BTC towards new highs. Realized Price Trends Confirm Ongoing Market Strength In a separate analysis, CryptoQuant analyst Crypto Dan examined Bitcoin’s realized price, a metric that reflects the average purchase price of all circulating BTC, as a tool to gauge market sentiment and directional strength. According to the report, the realized price is still on the rise, indicating that investors are increasingly accumulating BTC at higher prices. This trend differs significantly from previous cycles, where a reversal in the realized price preceded steep corrections. Crypto Dan attributes the current rise to institutional inflows, particularly through spot Bitcoin ETFs and corporate balance sheet purchases. These channels have brought in sustained capital, elevating the average acquisition price and reinforcing market structure. Related Reading: Why The US-China 90-Day Tariff Slash Can Push Bitcoin Price Above $110,000 As institutional players continue to allocate capital into Bitcoin, the realized price trend suggests that the ongoing rally may have more room to extend.

Analyst EGRAG CRYPTO says BTC closing above $109K is crucial for next bullish impulsive wave. Institutional interest in Bitcoin grows while retail is lukewarm; BTC dominance key to watch. Bitcoin (BTC) has once again surged past the six-figure mark, decisively crossing the $100,000 threshold with strong market momentum. As of press time, Bitcoin trades at $103,655 , reflecting nearly a 10% gain over the past week. A key aspect of this Bitcoin price $100k sustainable rally is that it comes without the usual signs of frothiness in the derivatives market. This, according to K33 Research, could signal a more sustainable rally this time around. Bitcoin has reclaimed six digits following continued strong momentum.

44593473,https://thecoinrise.com/is-web3bay-the-shopping-focused-crypto-platform-set-to-make-waves/,1747191616,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecoinrise.png,Is Web3Bay the Shopping-Focused Crypto Platform Set to Make Waves?,https://thecoinrise.com/is-web3bay-the-shopping-focused-crypto-platform-set-to-make-waves/,"In a market where price hype often wins attention, Web3Bay is quietly building a strong case by focusing on everyday shopping. While many crypto projects chase quick gains, Web3Bay is using its 3BAY coin to reward real activity, offering lasting value that few early-stage projects deliver. The idea is simple. Buyers who shop using 3BAY get an instant 5 percent discount. But the rewards do not end there. Buyers also earn daily bonuses, access special product drops, and help guide the platform’s future through governance rights. In short, every transaction becomes a chance to earn and participate, not just buy. The numbers back up this interest. Web3Bay has raised over 2 million dollars in its presale with more than 400 million coins sold at the current Stage 5 price of $0.005247. The final presale stage is set at $0.1959, offering those who join early the chance for a return of up to 6,400%. Unlike projects that only talk about future utility, Web3Bay is already live with a working marketplace. Real Benefits, Daily Earnings, True Platform Access Cashback rewards are common in traditional banking and shopping platforms, often offering 1 to 2 percent in points or restricted bonuses. Web3Bay offers something different. It gives users real, usable digital rewards for each purchase. Here’s the process. Buyers using 3BAY instantly get a 5 percent discount. In addition, Web3Bay provides ongoing daily rewards, building a cycle that encourages regular use. These rewards can be used within the platform, traded, or saved. What makes this model stand out is the added layer of community participation. Those holding 3BAY also gain the ability to vote on platform updates and new features. It gives every buyer the chance to help shape how the marketplace grows. This mix of savings, daily rewards, and shared control turns 3BAY into more than just a purchase method. It becomes a key part of the platform’s structure. That is what gives it lasting value in the fast-moving world of crypto. Why Web3Bay Is Gaining Attention Fast Web3Bay is solving a simple but overlooked fact: people shop in every market condition, whether prices are rising or falling. E-commerce remains one of the most stable industries, and connecting it to blockchain creates a huge new opportunity. Web3Bay does not try to change how people shop. Instead, it makes shopping more rewarding and allows users to take part in building a growing marketplace. What separates Web3Bay from other presale projects is that its platform is already live. It is not just a plan for the future but a real marketplace in action. Built on blockchain, it uses smart contract-based escrow and decentralized file storage through IPFS. It also works smoothly with crypto wallets and regular payment methods like PayPal, Google Pay, and Apple Pay. Web3Bay blends the ease of Web2 with the ownership model of Web3. This design helps attract both crypto users and everyday shoppers. Newcomers can start easily, and experienced users stay in control of their transactions. The system is built to grow, and it rewards those who take part early rather than only big companies or outside backers. Why Web3Bay Could Lead in Utility-Driven Crypto More people in crypto are shifting from trading for quick profits to using platforms that offer real benefits. Web3Bay aims to be a leader in this move toward useful crypto commerce. Projects like Ethereum and Solana grew because people built valuable products on them. Web3Bay follows the same path by tying 3BAY’s use to real shopping, active participation, and community decision-making. Those joining the presale now are not only hoping for future value. They are already joining a working system where 3BAY has a clear purpose today. The total supply is limited to 5 billion coins, and only 40 percent is set aside for crypto presale participants. The fixed supply and growing activity are starting to create demand. Web3Bay is not chasing trends or trying to be another meme coin. It aims to change online retail. It gives users a way to spend less, earn rewards, and have a say in how the platform grows. As presale stages move forward and prices rise, early participants in 3BAY may see themselves holding more than just a coin. They could be holding a role in shaping the future of online commerce.

Bitcoin holds steady, Ethereum keeps expanding, and focus is now shifting toward the next wave of standout players. Among the coins attracting attention are Solana, XRP, and Cardano, each showing renewed price action, solid patterns, and interest from institutions. But it’s BlockDAG that’s emerging as a serious contender. With its presale figures and scalable design, BDAG is drawing attention for its future potential. In a market looking for the next big mover, BlockDAG has become a name worth watching. Whether you’re a market veteran or just starting out, 2025 could be shaped by new leaders, and these four coins are top contenders. Let’s explore what makes each of these projects one of the top cryptos to watch this year. BlockDAG: 2520% Gain Potential BlockDAG has captured major attention in 2025. The project has now raised over $240.5 million and sold more than 20.1 billion BDAG coins, making it one of the most successful presales this year. Batch 28 is priced at $0.0262 with the launch price set at $0.05, that’s a projected gain of 2,520%. But BlockDAG ’s appeal goes beyond price. It supports EVM-compatible smart contracts and delivers fast transaction speeds. The project is developer-friendly and has already completed its CertiK audit. There are also signs of upcoming listings and strong interest from key players. Adoption is growing fast. The X1 Miner App has crossed one million downloads, and over 17,440 miner devices have been sold, pushing total miner sales beyond $7 million. These figures show that BlockDAG has traction beyond just early buzz. If you’re scanning the market for top cryptos to watch, BDAG offers one of the few opportunities with both a strong foundation and major growth upside, if you act now. Solana: Ecosystem Expansion Keeps SOL in the Lead Solana continues to perform well in 2025, now trading around $175.15 after a 0.40% daily increase. Over the past month, it’s up 36%, boosted by high trading activity and renewed institutional attention. The $150 mark has become a reliable support level. Analysts say if the upward trend holds, Solana could move toward $164 – $200 in the coming weeks. The chain’s strong throughput, low fees, and growing user base make it one of the top cryptos to watch this year. From DeFi projects to NFT activity, the network is staying active. Solana’s steady development and expanding utility ensure it keeps its place as a key player in the market’s next phase. For those watching the space, SOL remains a project to track closely. XRP: Legal Progress and Whale Interest Drive Sentiment XRP is making headlines again, priced at $2.46 and up 3.67% in 24 hours. Its daily volume has jumped above $4.35 billion. A rise in whale wallet activity and progress in Ripple’s legal situation are pushing the narrative. Analysts see $6.30 as a possible target if a favorable legal outcome is confirmed. That would clear a path for wider adoption. XRP recently broke past key resistance, a positive sign amid broader uncertainty. As a project focused on cross-border payments, XRP has a real use case. The combination of legal clarity and growing interest makes it one of the top cryptos to watch. The next few months may define its long-term place in the market. Cardano: Closing in on Key Resistance Levels Cardano (ADA) is showing upward momentum, with a current price of $0.8314 after a 4.02% gain in a day. It’s nearing an important resistance zone between $0.70 and $0.80. A breakout here could point to a run toward $1, a strong technical and psychological level. A descending triangle breakout and increased whale wallet activity suggest growing interest. Market sentiment also supports ADA’s path upward. Cardano’s strong focus on academic research and sustainability makes it stand out in the race for scalable blockchain networks. It has earned its spot among the top cryptos to watch for 2025, especially as it hits new milestones. Final Thoughts: The 2025 Crypto Picture Is Taking Shape The next wave of crypto leaders is starting to emerge. Solana has momentum, XRP is benefiting from legal shifts, and Cardano continues to deliver consistent updates. Each holds promise in its own way. But BlockDAG may offer the most striking opportunity. With its current price of $0.0262 available in batch 28, and strong traction across miners and users, it’s a project with real breakout potential. As the market gears up for its next move, these names will likely dominate the conversation around top cryptos to watch in 2025. The post Missed Bitcoin?

Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are back in focus, with rising whale activity, technical patterns, and community chatter. While both tokens attract fresh interest, another name is quietly picking up pace. Dragoin ($DDGN) has entered Stage 4 of its presale and is offering more than just hype. It brings live gameplay, immediate rewards, and a 6,700 percent return that is already set within its price tiers. Below is a closer look at the latest Shiba Inu and Dogecoin movements and why Dragoin might offer something different in 2025. Shiba Inu Gains Attention After Fake Token Alert The Shiba Inu team has issued a warning about fake SHIB tokens being shared on various platforms. They clarified that these tokens are not connected to any official project within the ecosystem. Even though the warning was defensive, it brought more visibility to SHIB. The token name started trending online again, and the community responded by highlighting the legitimacy of the original project. Developer activity has also remained steady, with Shibarium continuing to expand as part of the long-term Layer 2 plans. However, SHIB’s price has not moved much. It remains in a sideways trend, with long-term supporters staying hopeful but short-term action still limited. Dogecoin Whale Moves Hint at Possible Upside Dogecoin has shown new bullish signals backed by data. Whale accumulation has been noted by analysts at TronWeekly, a pattern that has in the past led to major price moves. The Dogecoin Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently in a neutral zone, which could support further price increases without risk of being overbought. Resistance levels at $0.16661 and $0.18028 are now being watched closely. If DOGE can pass these marks, some analysts expect the rally to gain speed. DOGE is picking up momentum. Buying interest is rising. But for new buyers coming in now, any gains will depend on whether the broader market pushes it back to old highs. That’s where Dragoin offers a different angle. It has value baked in through its price model, and its tools are already live. Dragoin ($DDGN) Combines Playable Utility With Meme Appeal Dragoin is not following the usual meme coin formula seen with DOGE or SHIB. It is setting up a different approach, offering one of the most original models in the meme coin category. This project starts with a working game. Right now, users can enter a live Telegram-based play-to-earn game where they manage dragons, complete tasks, and earn leaderboard rewards. There is no extra app to install. Players simply log in and start earning by staying active. The presale model is designed to be easy to follow and capable of handling scale. Running through 25 price stages, Dragoin is currently in Stage 4, with tokens priced at $0.0000444. The launch price is already confirmed at $0.002. This gives a simple, upfront return calculation. Early participants are buying at a level that offers 6,700% potential returns at the time of launch. Community activity is also central to this project. From the beginning, Dragoin has made open access and involvement a priority. Events, bonuses, and airdrops are not just for attention. They are part of how the project creates value. The idea is simple: users join, earn, and help guide the direction. This is not a project asking people to wait. It encourages them to take part. The numbers behind Dragoin’s possible upside are clear. At Stage 4, $1,000 gives around 29.85 million tokens. At launch, if listed at $0.002, that holding could be worth $67,000. That is a 6,700% increase built into the early sale. This does not include possible gains from gameplay, bonus rewards, or price action after the token lists. Clear Supply Design and Decentralized Control Dragoin’s total token supply is fixed at 200 billion. Half of that supply is allocated to the presale, letting more buyers enter early at a lower cost. Another 30% will go toward growing the ecosystem through in-game rewards, future development, and staking support. The next 15% is for liquidity, helping trading stay stable after launch. The last 5% is reserved for the team but locked for two years, showing long-term interest and preventing early exits. A key decision in Dragoin’s design is that all unsold tokens from the crypto presale will be permanently burned. This instantly reduces the supply and may increase the value of what remains. In addition, the smart contract will be renounced at launch, taking all control away from the developers and making the project fully decentralized. These steps are not just features. They are built into the structure and show Dragoin’s focus on transparency and stability. A Closer Look at Three Meme Coins Comparing SHIB, DOGE, and Dragoin shows three very different types of projects. Shiba Inu is facing false token issues and building its ecosystem slowly. Dogecoin has some positive signs, but most interest depends on large holders and community reactions. Dragoin, on the other hand, already has a working game, real-time rewards, and a defined return path with a decentralized setup in motion. People who are holding SHIB or DOGE may feel they are making a stable choice. But higher returns rarely come with complete safety. If you are someone who missed early chances in DOGE or SHIB, Dragoin is now offering an entry that matches those earlier prices, but with added features and a working product. With Stage 4 still active, the lower prices are available now. Later stages may not give the same starting point.

In this article, we’ll break down the recent price action, what could happen next, and a long-term prediction for Cardano’s future. Cardano Breaks a New High After Months For the first time since December, Cardano’s price broke out of its downward trend. Recently, it reached as high as $0.86 before pulling back slightly. This move was important because it could mean a possible shift from a bearish (downward) market to a bullish (upward) trend. At the moment, Cardano has strong support levels around $0.77 to $0.72. There’s a chance the price could revisit these levels before starting another push higher. Can ADA Reach $2 or More This Bull Market? According to Investing Broz, by the end of summer, Cardano could aim for new highs between $1.70 and $2.40. But what about the top of this entire bull market? To figure that out, it’s important to consider a few important factors: how much ADA will be in circulation, how much of the total crypto market Cardano will control, and what the overall crypto market cap might be. When Will the Bull Market Peak? Predicting the exact timing of a bull market top is tough. Some believe it could follow the classic four-year cycle and peak around September or October 2025. However, recent trends suggest this cycle might not hold up anymore. The crypto market has changed, with big institutions playing a larger role now. Unlike retail investors, institutions often use market manipulation tactics, causing unexpected price movements. Because of this, the top of the bull market could come earlier or later than expected. A safe guess would be around mid-2026, when more institutional money might flow into the market. How Much ADA Will Be in Circulation? Right now, there are about 35.3 billion ADA tokens in circulation. By the summer of 2026, this number is expected to rise to around 36.5 billion. This gradual increase will slightly affect the price as more tokens become available. How Much of the Crypto Market Will Cardano Control? At the moment, Cardano holds about 0.88% of the total crypto market. In previous bull markets, its dominance was higher. However, with more competition in the market today, it’s unlikely to reclaim those old levels. A reasonable expectation for Cardano’s dominance would be between 2% and 4% by the peak of the bull market. While some believe it could go higher, the growing number of altcoins makes this range a realistic target. Cardano’s Possible Market Cap and Price If the total crypto market reaches $11 trillion and Cardano holds between 2% and 4% dominance, its market cap could range from $220 billion to $440 billion. Based on these market cap numbers and the expected 36.5 billion ADA tokens in circulation, Cardano’s price could land between $6 and $12 during the peak of the bull market. In a very bullish scenario, where the total market reaches $22 trillion, Cardano’s market cap could climb as high as $880 billion.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-14 03:03:24

Here’s Why Lightchain AI Could Be Your Next Big Win,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/is-the-bear-market-crushing-portfolios-heres-why-lightchain-ai-could-be-your-next-big-win/,"In a market that has been dominated by the bears, Lightchain AI is offering investors a path of escape. Its presale has hit $20.2 million, with tokens selling at $0.007, making the project one of the best ways for investors to turn their fortunes around in this market cycle. While many coins have been battling the bears, Lightchain AI continues its impressive rise, thanks to its great vision and practical value. As the wider market continues to drop, those looking for hedges are turning to projects that have a real staying power, making Lightchain AI one of the most promising in that aspect. Why Is Bear Market Devastating Crypto Portfolios? The ongoing crypto winter has been hurting portfolios, with the effect worsened by macroeconomic and sector factors. Rising interest rates and other monetary policies have also removed liquidity in the system, leading to investors leaving riskier classes of assets like cryptocurrencies. In addition, projects like FTX have also reduced investor confidence, leading to sharp selloffs. Moreover, there has been increased regulatory attention and enforcement, leading to an increase in the uncertainty in the market, causing investors to be cautious. Also, fast money movements, which is down to the quick inflows and outflows of money (primarily institutional investors via ETFs) have caused volatility in the market. These factors combined and caused the market to witness a downturn, showing the importance of risk management practices and diversification of assets in the crypto industry. Nevertheless, there is always a ray of hope that shines in these times. As short-term traders attempt to make their way during these volatile periods, it has provided an opportunity for long-term investors to increase their portfolios. One of the projects that can be used to achieve this is Lightchain AI, a project that is worth being invested in. Why Lightchain AI is Poised for Significant Growth Unlike speculative meme coins or projects that depend on hype, Lightchain AI stands out in the crypto industry, addressing the major challenges in the blockchain and AI industry and providing real value. One of its most impressive features is its cryptographic verification system, which ensures that only legitimate updates are added to the blockchain. This ensures that users can feel secure and trust the network, showing that the project is focused on real change rather than empty promises. Lightchain AI is a project that promises real application and has a strong growth potential. Another highlight is its Memecoin Launchpad, which was designed to help creators and developers. It has different AI-powered tools that help creators bring their ideas to life, ensuring that they earn well. It is all about improving creativity and aiding the development of the new generation of blockchain ecosystems. Why Lightchain AI is Turning Heads, Even in Bear Market The crypto industry might be facing its challenges, Lightchain AI is still drawing attention, and it’s for the right reasons. The AI industry is on the rise, and the project is leading that charge in combining AI and blockchain technology. Even in tough market conditions, the project still raised $20.2 million in its presale. That kind of confidence from investors is not just luck, it is a sign that Lightchain AI is ready for something big as the market prepares to bounce back. What really sets Lightchain AI apart? It provides investors with the perfect time to het into the project. With tokens still selling for $0.007, this is the perfect opportunity for investors to enter, positioning themselves for profits when the token starts to rise after the launch. As crypto begins to recover, Lightchain AI stands out as a project that wants to change things. It has a bold vision and a rising demand that make it more than just the next project, making it an investment that has real promise. Opportunities like this are hard to find, so it might be the best opportunity to take a look at the project. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf Tweets by LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",Press Release,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-14 03:11:52

As furore about U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs rages on, one age-old reality remains constant for the Japanese: gold is valuable. Regional media in Japan reports that gold is being adopted more and more as a safe haven against looming economic threats.Kyodo News recently detailed that Japanese investors are turning to the shiny yellow metal via the government’s controversial new NISA (Nippon Individual Savings Account), as well as through solid, direct investment. Japan residents take shelter in gold via NISA, direct investment NISA’s tax-exemption schemes for private investors afford individuals the ability to invest in products linked to gold’s price movements, but direct investments are also reportedly on the rise.Tanaka Precious Metal Technologies, Co. notes of the inter-dealer price (translated): “[The] price was also boosted by reports that US President Trump was considering firing Fed Chairman Powell, reaching a monthly high of 15,561 yen on the 22nd. After that, US President Trump denied the idea of ​​firing the Fed Chairman, and selling prevailed due to expectations of an easing of US-China trade friction, and the month ended at 15,198 yen.” JPY-denominated Tanaka Precious Metals retail bullion price. Source: Tanaka . Notably, gold tapped an all-time JPY price high per gram on April 22, and again on May 8, according to the asset bullion retail rate set by Tanaka. The tax-excluded, inter-dealer reference price (mentioned above) similarly tapped a high on the 22nd, but has since cooled off.The Kyodo News report notes that concerns about global economic downturn and Donald Trump’s trade war have Tokyoites and residents of Japan not only buying up bullion and coins, but also “investing in pure gold at fixed monthly values” via Tanaka Precious Metals, which investments reportedly grew 26% as compared to the January-April period from a year ago.Further, Komehyo Co., a major secondhand luxury brand retailer, says gold product sales (including accessories) climbed 30% year-on-year as of March 2025.Investments such as the Mitsubishi UFJ fine gold fund (tied to gold’s price), have also seen growth, with inflows of “19.2 billion yen in March, up by about 2.6-fold from last December,” according to Kyodo. Japan’s political and economic strife a major factor Even before fear of Trump’s stifling of international exchange, Japan has been struggling with multiple issues, most of which have been the direct result of dysfunctional government policy. These issues include lack of adequate pensions for the elderly, skyrocketing inflation, rice prices at all-time highs , destructive inbound tourism, a new self-described “defense geek” prime minister with a strikingly low approval rating.Given the turmoil, people seem to be turning to gold in an ages old strategy designed to protect themselves from such problems. To many residents of the archipelago, Japan’s PM seems more interested in pouring JPY into the U.S. state , than helping fix the problems at hand.

The memo says revenue in the fiscal year that starts in July will fall 4% from the state’s earlier forecast. Staff members link the slide to a stock sell‑off that hit Wall Street after Trump set out a wide tariff push on April 2. The officials broke down the projected loss this way: about $10 billion less from capital‑gains taxes, $2.5 billion less from corporate taxes, and roughly $3.5 billion less from personal‑income taxes tied to wages and business profits. “Trump’s tariff policies weakened the national and state outlook and caused equity losses,” the memo says. Officials add that these factors began to drag on California receipts in 2025 and erased the strong cash flow the state had seen earlier in the year. Even so, revenue for the fiscal year that ends in June still stands $6.8 billion above Newsom’s last estimate. On the same day the memo came out, a rally led by technology firms pushed U.S. stocks into positive territory for the year. Washington and Beijing said on Monday they will temporarily lower duties on each other’s goods, another sign that could boost investor mood. Newsom calls the gap “Trump Slump” Politico first reported on the memo, which lands one day before the governor is due to unveil his new budget proposal for the coming fiscal year. California’s budget is dependent on the richest households. The top 1% of earners pay nearly half of all personal‑income tax, and much of that money hinges on capital‑gains income that follows the stock market. The new hit to the treasury comes on top of $27.3 billion in financial remedies. It includes $16.1 billion in cuts and a $7.1 billion removal from the state’s rainy‑day fund. California’s constitution requires a balanced budget each year, which means that any shortfall must be closed. Hence, this will be the third year in a row that Newsom and lawmakers trim spending after earlier budgets allocated more money than the state can spend on various programs. Trump’s April tariff order placed duties on all imported goods, raised taxes on items from Mexico, Canada and China, and set extra levies on products such as cars and aluminum. While the president has since eased some of those tariffs, Newsom argues that the policy and the uncertainty around it will raise unemployment and inflation, lower gross domestic product and shrink capital‑gains revenue for California. Last month California sued Trump, saying that he lacks the authority to impose tariffs all on his own. On Tuesday, state attorneys said they will ask a federal judge for a preliminary injunction that would freeze the tariffs while the case moves forward.

This surge comes as tariff tensions between China and the United States ease off, and macroeconomic conditions become positive again. According to a report from the crypto exchange Bitfinex, favorable macroeconomic conditions and significant institutional demand can keep BTC on a positive trajectory in the meantime. Analysts said that with macro catalysts returning to the forefront, BTC will continue to display relative strength compared with equities and other risk assets. Bitcoin Reclaims $100K One development driving the confidence that has returned to the market is the Federal Reserve’s positive comments on the rate trajectory around the U.S. tariff situation. The comments’ positivity has created a backdrop that has strengthened bitcoin’s recovery and set the stage for a renewed push to new ATHs. Per Bitfinex analysts, China has paused retaliatory tariffs against the U.S., following “backchannel progress” between both countries. The market now faces reduced geopolitical tail risk and ongoing fiscal support, and with rate cuts still on the table, risk assets, led by BTC, could perform well. Bitcoin’s resurgence has triggered a fresh wave of capital inflows, reviving market liquidity and participation. Some investors are re-entering the market, while others are de-risking and taking profits. Bitfinex said the renewed capital inflow is evident in the realized cap. This metric measures the aggregate cost basis of all coins in circulation and tells how much capital enters the market over time. Bitcoin’s realized cap has hit an ATH of $889 billion, rising by 2.1% in the past 30 days. This indicates a sharp uptick in net inflows, reinforcing analysts’ belief that bitcoin’s recent gains are driven by fresh liquidity and not speculative rotation. While BTC hovered below the $75,000 range, more than 5 million coins were at an unrealized loss; however, the price recovery has reduced that number to 0.7 million. Institutional Demand Becomes Steady In addition to bitcoin’s realized cap hitting a new ATH, U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have recorded massive inflows in the last two weeks. Inflow patterns observed by analysts suggest that ETF flows are becoming de-correlated from short-term pullbacks. The demand signals steady allocation from market participants, not opportunistic buying, driven by portfolio mandates, not retail speculation.

However, various analysts forecast potential volatility for the King of Altcoins, as it faces some resistance at the current levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces Key Resistance After 10% Weekly Rally – Confirmation Or Rejection Next? Ethereum To Trade Sideways Before Next Jump After surging nearly 45% in the past week, Ethereum has reclaimed its $2,200-$3,900 macro range lost in March. During the late-April market pump, the cryptocurrency recovered from its 18-month low of $1,380, jumping toward the $1,800 resistance before breaking out last Thursday. ETH has smashed past the $2,000 resistance and regained the crucial $2,100 and $2,300 levels before retesting the $2,600 resistance over the weekend. Since then, the King of Altcoins has hovered between the $2,400-$2,600 price range, hitting a two-month high of $2,624 on Monday. Market watcher Castillo Trading highlighted that Ethereum is “doing exactly what it should be. Taking some time to build a base at important levels before the next move.” The analyst stated that the $2,400-$2,700 zone will likely be ETH’s trading range for the upcoming days after its retest of the range lows as support, with “some shakeouts in both directions before continuing its next leg up.” Similarly, Daan Crypto Trades noted that the cryptocurrency’s current level is important, as it could determine its short-term direction. According to the trader, Ethereum could drop to $2,300 or below the $2,100 support level if it loses the key area. “In that case, you can simply wait for a consolidation to be formed at those levels,” he explained. On the contrary, if ETH breaks past the $2,600 resistance, and price keeps surging, the current level may “become a nice retest of the horizontal.” Notably, the next crucial horizontal level sits around the $2,850-$2,900 range, a significant support and resistance area amid the Q3 2024 pullback and the Q4 2024 breakout. Is A Dip Or A 15% Shakeout Coming? Analyst Rekt Capital pointed out that Ethereum secured a key Weekly Close after closing the week at $2,514 and officially reclaiming its Macro Range. According to the analyst, history suggests that ETH will “likely lift across the Range” over time, while “any dips, if needed at all, would only solidify $2200 as Range Low support.” He stressed that the recent Weekly Close occurred at the top of a crucial cluster, enabling a scenario where “just a small dip would suffice, if the green circled retest repeats here at ~$2468 (black).” However, if that level is lost, ETH could see a 10%-15% pullback toward the $2,200-$2,100 mark. Rekt Capital also remarked that the second-largest crypto by market capitalization has managed to fill the $2,530-$2,630 Daily CME Gap, created in March. Related Reading: Why The US-China 90-Day Tariff Slash Can Push Bitcoin Price Above $110,000 Amid its breakout, ETH also formed two small CME Gaps at the $2,300-$2,400 and $2,100-$2,200 levels, which could be closed soon. The former is the “more important dipping area, as it is also a Weekly CME Gap.” Additionally, he affirmed that Ethereum intends to fill its Macro CME Gap, between $2,900 and $3,350, signaling that a surge toward those levels could be ahead. As of this writing, Ethereum trades at $2,597, a 5% increase in the daily timeframe.

This 20% one-week rise places it ahead of the broader cryptocurrency market, which has seen a 13% uptick over the same period. The surge in price has been matched by a sharp increase in derivatives activity. In just one week, futures open interest for XRP ( XRP ) has increased from $2.42 billion to $3.42 billion, according to a May 13 post on X from Glassnode. This $1 billion spike, or a 41.6% rise, shows growing influx of capital and increased speculative activity, suggesting that traders are positioning for a major move. $XRP Futures Open Interest has surged by over $1B in the past week, rising from $2.42B to $3.42B (+41.6%). This sharp increase in leverage coincides with a price rally from $2.14 to $2.48, suggesting elevated speculative activity and growing directional conviction, pic.twitter.com/QbsaOM9oxE — glassnode (@glassnode) May 13, 2025 Open interest refers to the total number of active futures contracts that have not yet been settled. When open interest climbs alongside price, it typically reflects new money entering the market, rather than short-covering or position unwinding.

XRP price analysis. crypto.news At 68, the relative strength index is getting close to but not yet past the overbought zone, indicating that there is still potential for the current trend to continue. Other important indicators, like the moving average convergence divergence, point to continued upward movement. Alongside chart strength, institutional demand appears to be growing. The XXRP ETF, which provides institutional investors with exposure to XRP, has seen inflows for five weeks in a row. The fund brought in $14 million last week, up from $10 million the previous week, according to data from etf.com. The fund’s total assets under management now amount to over $99 million. This is notable considering that its 1.89% annual management fee is almost twice as high as some of the more well-known Bitcoin ( BTC ) ETFs. Despite this, investor interest is still high, suggesting that there is a greater demand for products linked to XRP. This rise in demand coincides with mounting speculation that spot XRP ETFs will soon be approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Platforms like Polymarket now show that the odds of approval are 80%. According to JPMorgan analysts, XRP ETF inflows could reach $8 billion in the first year, surpassing Ethereum ( ETH ) ETF inflows since their approval in September 2024. Because of its strong technical structure, growing institutional interest, and rising open interest, XRP looks ready for a significant breakout if the current trends continue.

It dipped below $1,800 just days ago and is now pushing toward the $2,700 mark. The retail investors who were once doubtful are now looking for the right moment to jump in. So what’s next for Ethereum? Santiment has recently shared some exciting insights on Ethereum’s comeback. Back in 2017, there was talk of Ethereum overtaking Bitcoin as the top crypto, thanks to its smart contracts and developer-friendly ecosystem. While that never happened, the debate over Ethereum’s potential to outshine Bitcoin’s first-mover advantage is still alive. Abraxas Capital bought another 33,482 $ETH ($84.7M) in the past 12 hours, bringing their total purchases over the last 6 days to 211,030 $ETH ($477.6M). https://t.co/qZZkGndZEd pic.twitter.com/mOIdthyWUG — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) May 13, 2025 The social sentiment has also flipped fast. Right before this pump, the bears were in control, with many doubting Ethereum’s growth potential as other altcoins grabbed the spotlight. But as Ether got back on track, the doubters were silenced, with targets now calling for $3,500 or even higher. Transaction Fees Drop Another factor to watch is transaction fees. They’ve dropped to around $0.84 per transfer, much lower than the $7 range six months ago. But if the fees start climbing back to $2 or above, the rally could be at risk. Lookonchain data shows that Abraxas Capital recently bought 33,482 ETH worth about $84.7 million on May 13. The firm has accumulated over 211K ETH, worth around $477 million, in the past 6 days, playing a big role in the recent price surge.

Relief’s tweet references an older claim about a high price projection for XRP, based on a valuation model co-developed by Mitchnick during his time with Ripple. In the tweet, Remi Relief wrote, “XRP $4000. For those that don’t know who Robert Mitchnick is… look him up. Short summary. He use to work for Ripple and now works for BlackRock. Idk if he ‘left’ Ripple or was ‘sent’ to BR. IMO he was sent there.” This was in response to a tweet from another X account, who said , “Robert Mitchnick, previously worked at Ripple and now working at Blackrock, thinks XRP price target is $4,000.” XRP $4000 For those that don’t know who Robert Mitchnick is…look him up. Short summary. He use to work for Ripple and now works for BlackRock. Idk if he “left” Ripple or was “sent” to BR. IMO he was sent there. https://t.co/OqXN5VQfxG — The Real Remi Relief (@RemiReliefX) May 11, 2025 Attached to the second post is a screenshot of an article published in 2024. The article reported a valuation model developed by Stanford professor Susan Athey and Robert Mitchnick, which proposed a potential fair market value of $4,813 for XRP. Based on assumptions in the 2018 Athey-Mitchnick model, that projection has since resurfaced through the recent attention on social media. Breakdown of the Athey-Mitchnick Model The model in question evaluates XRP’s future price based on two primary assumptions: the asset’s use in global cross-border transactions and its function as a store of value. According to the analysis, the price could reach thousands of dollars per unit if XRP were to facilitate 10% of global transactions by 2030 and simultaneously capture 10% of global store-of-value demand. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 At the time of the model’s publishing, XRP was approximately $0.5281. The paper argued that XRP’s market performance had been hindered by external factors such as regulatory actions and price suppression. It proposed that under conditions of unrestricted utility, XRP could achieve significant valuation increases. The model assumed a daily transaction volume of $700 billion and a total demand for storing XRP of $53 trillion by 2030. It also applied a 10% discount rate to account for the time value of money. The projected fair market value of $4,813 took into consideration that escrowed XRP would remain locked, further limiting circulating supply and boosting price estimates. Relevance of Mitchnick’s Position at BlackRock Remi Relief’s tweet questions whether Mitchnick’s move from Ripple to BlackRock was voluntary or strategic. While there is no public confirmation on the nature of his transition, some in the community interpret it as significant, especially in light of BlackRock’s increasing involvement in digital asset markets. Relief did not claim direct confirmation of Mitchnick endorsing the $4,000 target but noted the connection between his prior modeling work and his current position at a leading financial institution. Although the original model did not account for all possible developments, such as the emergence of central bank digital currencies or other unforeseen innovations, it remains one of the more widely cited theoretical assessments of XRP’s long-term price potential. It emphasized the asset’s built-in scarcity and scalability benefits in global financial infrastructure. The resurfacing of this topic through Remi Relief and others brings renewed attention to a historical but influential valuation model that continues to inform sections of the XRP community’s expectations.

The platform and its backers sold over 11.92 million shares for $52 each, which are slated to start trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on May 14 under the ticker symbol ETOR, eToro said in a May 13 press release. Initially, the firm aimed to raise $500 million by offering 10 million shares priced between $46 to $50 each. The share offering will remain open until at least May 15 and consists of more than 5.9 million shares sold by eToro and 5.9 million shares sold by specific existing shareholders. The Israel-based eToro will go public as a rival to Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD), which went public in July 2021 and whose shares are up over 67% year to date, according to Google Finance. Robinhood closed May 13 trading up over 67% at $62 per share, nearing its all-time high of $65, which it hit in February. Source: Google Finance Initially, eToro made confidential filings with the SEC in January for a public offering before publicly announcing the plans on March 24. Digital banking fintech firm Chime has also applied to list its stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol CHY. However, the number of shares and price range are still to be determined. Investment advisory firm Renaissance Capital speculated in a May 13 note to its clients that Chime’s IPO could raise up to $1 billion. Crypto IPOs in the works Other crypto companies are also mulling plans to go public. Crypto exchange Kraken is reportedly considering a public offering this year. Stablecoin issuer Circle filed with the SEC on April 1, then paused its plans after President Donald Trump’s April 2 tariff announcements tanked global markets and stopped many in-the-works public offerings. Crypto custody services firm BitGo launched a global over-the-counter trading desk for digital assets in February, after it was reported to be gearing up for an initial public offering slated for later this year.

Its ups and downs over the past week are the slowest they’ve been in 563 days. When coins go this still, sharp climbs or big drops can often come next. So, what can people expect from BTC and other big coins like ETH, XRP, and ADA? Bitcoin (BTC): Nearing a key test Right now, Bitcoin is close to $95,000. However, here’s the big thing — its swings in price have slowed to their lowest in more than 500 days. That calm often means a storm could be on the way. If BTC climbs past $95K, it may soon push toward $100K. It could aim for as high as $107K if it breaks that point. Yet, if it can’t break through, it might fall back to the $90K zone or even near $85K. Dogecoin (DOGE): Still in its range DOGE is stuck between $0.14 and $0.21. That’s a tight space, and it’s been there for some time. If DOGE breaks past $0.21, that could set off a good rise to $0.28. However, if it falls below $0.14, it might drop back to $0.10. Many traders holding meme coins like DOGE often look at trends and price shifts before making a move, or even enjoy crypto games like Mine Island to pass the time as they wait for clear market signals. Ethereum (ETH): Could jump soon ETH is doing well, holding strong above $1,800. If it exceeds the $1,858 mark, people could see a good push up to $2,111. If it goes above that, ETH may then climb to $2,550. That would be a big deal, as it might end its slow spell. However, if ETH drops below key lines like its 20-day or 50-day moving spots, it may get stuck between $1,368 and $2,111 for some time. Ripple (XRP): At a crossroads XRP is in a tricky spot. It’s now below its trend lines, which is not a good sign for people who want to see it rise. It could hit the key line at $2 if it keeps falling. If it breaks that, it might drop to $1.61. Yet, if Ripple bounces back and climbs over its past high, XRP might get back on track and rise to $3. Cardano (ADA): Holding steady ADA is still above its main support lines, which is a good sign, but bulls must act soon. If this coin drops below those lines, it might fall to $0.58; if it breaks through $0.75, it could increase to $0.83. Chainlink (LINK): Needs to bounce LINK got close to $16 but couldn’t stay there. It dropped back to its safe zones — the moving averages. If LINK gets a good bounce here, it might try to break out again and surpass its trend line. However, it could go as low as $11.68 if it falls further. Avalanche (AVAX): Double-bottom chance AVAX is now at its safe price lines, which might pull in buyers. If it climbs from here, AVAX could form a ‘double-bottom’, a shape that often means the coin is set to rise. If that happens, it could go to $31.73, but if it drops below $19.68, it may stay stuck in a wide range between $15.27 and $23.50. Big moves may be next Bitcoin’s long calm spell may soon end — and with it, people could see a big move not just in BTC but in other top altcoins too. Some coins show signs of hope, while others hold at key spots. Like the Mine Island game, the crypto market can shift instantly, with steep climbs or sharp falls that test your timing. For traders and fans alike, staying sharp and watching the charts could be key in the days ahead.",Crypto News|Press Release|ALTCOINS|BITCOIN,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|BTC|DOGE|ETH,"{'name': 'Bitcoin World', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinworld,2025-05-14 04:59:03
44596330,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=160120,1747198833,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Legal AI Startup Harvey Makes Strategic AI Models Shift,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/harvey-legal-ai-shift/,"In the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence, where foundation models are the bedrock for innovation, a significant development has caught the attention of the tech community, including those interested in cryptocurrency applications leveraging AI. Harvey, a prominent player in the Legal AI space and notably backed by the OpenAI Startup Fund, has announced it will begin incorporating leading AI models from both Anthropic and Google. Why This AI Models Shift Matters This move, detailed in a recent Harvey blog post, goes beyond Harvey’s previous reliance solely on OpenAI models. While Harvey states it is not abandoning OpenAI’s technology but rather adding diversity, the integration of models from key competitors like Anthropic and Google represents a notable win for these companies in the competitive AI landscape. Harvey is a high-profile success story from the OpenAI Startup Fund’s early portfolio, having grown to a reported $3 billion valuation. The significance is amplified by Harvey’s history: Harvey was among the first four startups the OpenAI Startup Fund backed in late 2022. The company has seen rapid growth and secured substantial funding rounds. Interestingly, Google’s venture arm, GV, led Harvey’s Series C round, yet Harvey didn’t immediately adopt Google’s Google AI models until now. What Drove Harvey to Adopt New AI Models? The decision wasn’t arbitrary. Harvey developed an internal benchmark called ‘BigLaw’ to evaluate how different foundation models perform on various legal tasks. The results were compelling: A variety of models are becoming increasingly capable in legal applications. Specific models demonstrate particular strengths in different legal tasks. Within a year, multiple non-OpenAI models outperformed Harvey’s original benchmarked system. Instead of focusing resources on training its own models from scratch, Harvey concluded it was more efficient to leverage high-performing, general reasoning models from other vendors and fine-tune them specifically for the legal market. This includes accessing models from Anthropic and Google, sometimes via cloud providers like Amazon. Benchmarking Reveals Task-Specific Strengths Harvey’s BigLaw benchmark provided crucial insights into which AI models excel at what. For example, their testing indicated: Google AI ‘s Gemini 2.5 Pro shows strength in legal drafting. However, Gemini 2.5 Pro reportedly struggles with certain pre-trial tasks, like writing oral arguments, due to challenges understanding complex evidentiary rules such as hearsay. OpenAI’s models perform well on such pre-trial tasks. Anthropic ‘s Claude 3.7 Sonnet also performs strongly in these areas, following closely behind OpenAI’s performance in some pre-trial tasks. These findings underscore the reality that no single model is universally superior for all tasks, prompting the need for a multi-model strategy in specialized fields like Legal AI . Future Implications: AI Agents and Transparency Using a diverse set of AI models will also be beneficial as Harvey develops AI agents for legal workflows. Furthermore, Harvey plans to contribute to the broader AI community by sharing its BigLaw benchmark findings publicly. They intend to launch a public leaderboard ranking major reasoning models on legal tasks. This leaderboard won’t just rely on single scores but will also incorporate qualitative insights from experienced lawyers, offering a more nuanced view of model performance. This move not only diversifies Harvey’s technological foundation but also puts pressure on its model providers, including its investor OpenAI and investor Google (via GV), to continue innovating and proving their models’ capabilities in real-world, high-stakes applications like law. Harvey’s Perspective and the Competitive Landscape Despite integrating competitor models, Harvey maintains a positive relationship with its initial backer. Harvey CEO Winston Weinberg stated, “We are incredibly fortunate to have OpenAI as an investor in Harvey and key collaborator in our product. And, we are energized to add to our options for customers as we continue to serve the needs of our customers globally.” This strategic shift by a leading Legal AI company like Harvey highlights the intense competition among foundation model providers. While OpenAI remains a dominant force, companies like Anthropic and Google are rapidly advancing their capabilities, making multi-model strategies increasingly attractive for developers building specialized AI applications. The focus is shifting towards leveraging the best available tool for each specific job, rather than being locked into a single provider, even when that provider is also an investor.

DOGE is now gaining pace and might rise toward the $0.2650 zone. DOGE price started a fresh increase above the $0.220 and $0.2320 levels. The price is trading above the $0.2350 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $0.2350 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could start a fresh increase if it clears the $0.2450 resistance zone. Dogecoin Price Aims Higher Dogecoin price started a fresh increase after it found support near $0.2170, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. DOGE climbed and recovered above the $0.2250 resistance zone. The bulls even pushed the price above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.2531 swing high to the $0.2173 low. Besides, there is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $0.2350 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. Dogecoin price is now trading above the $0.2350 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.240 level. The first major resistance for the bulls could be near the $0.2440 level and the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.2531 swing high to the $0.2173 low. The next major resistance is near the $0.2530 level. A close above the $0.2530 resistance might send the price toward the $0.2650 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.2720 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.2850. Another Decline In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.2440 level, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.2350 level. The next major support is near the $0.2250 level. The main support sits at $0.2150. If there is a downside break below the $0.2150 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might decline toward the $0.20 level or even $0.1880 in the near term.

It plans to list on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker ETOR on May 14. Founded in 2007 as a social stock-trading network, eToro added crypto trading in 2018 and has since grown into one of the largest retail crypto brokers. In September, it agreed to limit its US crypto offerings to Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Ether to settle SEC charges that it operated as an unregistered broker and clearing agency. eToro $ETOR looks like a strong IPO upcoming… pic.twitter.com/WvBzD7zPYo — Mike Zaccardi, CFA, CMT (@MikeZaccardi) May 13, 2025 BlackRock Eyes $100M Stake at IPO Price Regulatory filings show eToro seeks to sell 11.92m shares in the upsized deal. BlackRock signaled interest in purchasing up to $100m of shares at the IPO price. Goldman Sachs, Jefferies UBS and Citigroup served as lead underwriters. The Israel-based trading platform had earlier targeted a valuation of up to $4b in the offering. However, the upsized pricing now gives eToro a market cap of about $4.3b based on outstanding shares. Additionally, its fully diluted value approaches $5b once employee options are included. This marks a rebound from a failed 2022 SPAC merger that would have valued the company at more than $10b. At the time, wider market turmoil prompted eToro to pause its public listing plans. Crypto Firms Target US Listings in 2025 The renewed push comes as US IPO activity picks up under the current administration’s more permissive stance on markets and technology companies. Several other crypto firms are eying US IPOs in 2025 amid recovering markets and looser regulations.

44596707,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=160121,1747199439,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Coinbase Unleashes New Wrapped Tokens: cbADA, cbDOGE, cbLTC, cbXRP Incoming",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/coinbase-wrapped-tokens-launch/,"Big news is brewing in the crypto world, specifically from one of its major players. Coinbase recently dropped an announcement on X (formerly Twitter) that has caught the attention of many traders and investors. The platform is preparing to launch new assets bearing the ‘cb’ prefix: cbADA, cbDOGE, cbLTC, and cbXRP. While not yet live, this move signals an interesting strategic direction for the exchange giant and its growing ecosystem. What Exactly Are These Wrapped Tokens on Coinbase? The announcement specifically mentions ‘cbADA’, ‘cbDOGE’, ‘cbLTC’, and ‘cbXRP’. The ‘cb’ prefix strongly suggests these will be wrapped tokens native to Coinbase’s own Layer 2 network, Coinbase Base . Think of a wrapped token as a representation of another cryptocurrency on a different blockchain. It’s like taking a Bitcoin and wrapping it in a standard ERC-20 token on Ethereum (creating wBTC) so it can be used in Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem. In this case, Coinbase appears to be creating wrapped versions of Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE), Litecoin (LTC), and Ripple (XRP) that can live and operate on the Base network. Why do this? Native ADA lives on the Cardano blockchain, DOGE on its own chain, LTC on Litecoin’s chain, and XRP on the XRP Ledger. These blockchains don’t inherently talk to each other directly, especially not with the speed and low cost often desired for activities within a specific ecosystem like a Layer 2 network focused on dApps and DeFi. By creating wrapped versions on Base, Coinbase can potentially: Make these crypto assets easily usable within the Base ecosystem. Enable new trading pairs directly on Base or potentially within Coinbase’s own exchange interface leveraging Base. Allow users to potentially interact with DeFi protocols on Base using these popular assets. It’s important to reiterate that these assets are not yet live . Coinbase’s announcement clearly states that the official launch date will be revealed later. This gives the community time to understand what’s coming and prepare. Why is Coinbase Introducing Wrapped Versions of ADA, DOGE, LTC, and XRP? Coinbase’s strategy with Base is to build a robust, developer-friendly, and user-centric Layer 2 ecosystem. Bringing popular crypto assets like ADA, DOGE, LTC, and XRP onto Base through wrapping aligns perfectly with this goal. Here are some key reasons behind this move: Expanding Base’s Asset Portfolio: To attract users and developers, Base needs a diverse range of assets beyond just ETH and tokens native to Base. Including widely held assets like ADA, DOGE, LTC, and XRP instantly broadens Base’s appeal. Enhancing Utility: By wrapping these tokens, Coinbase potentially unlocks new utility for them within the Base ecosystem. Imagine using cbADA as collateral in a lending protocol on Base, or providing liquidity for a cbDOGE/cbETH pair on a Base-based decentralized exchange (DEX). Deepening Integration: This move further integrates these specific assets into the broader Coinbase product suite, potentially offering seamless transfers between the main exchange and Base, or even enabling specific features tied to the wrapped versions. Responding to Demand: ADA, DOGE, LTC, and XRP have large, active communities. Making it easier for holders of these assets to participate in the growing Base ecosystem could drive significant activity. Competing in the Wrapped Asset Space: Wrapped versions of major cryptocurrencies (like wBTC) are common on other chains. Coinbase creating its own standard for wrapping popular assets positions Base competitively. This isn’t just about listing new tokens; it’s about building bridges between established crypto assets and the emerging opportunities on a Layer 2 network designed for scale and lower costs. What Are the Potential Benefits for Users and Holders? For users of Coinbase and holders of ADA DOGE LTC XRP , the introduction of their wrapped counterparts on Base could offer several advantages: Access to Base Ecosystem: Users can potentially interact with decentralized applications (dApps) and DeFi protocols on Base using their existing holdings of these popular assets, without needing to bridge or swap for ETH or other Base-native tokens first. Lower Transaction Costs: Transactions on Layer 2 networks like Base are typically significantly cheaper and faster than transactions on the native chains of ADA, DOGE, LTC, or XRP, or even Ethereum Layer 1. Potential for New Yield Opportunities: Wrapped assets can often be used in DeFi protocols for lending, borrowing, staking (if supported), or providing liquidity to earn yield. The Base ecosystem is growing, and these wrapped assets could open up new avenues for passive income. Seamless Coinbase Integration: Given that these are ‘cb’ tokens from Coinbase, it’s likely that moving assets between the main Coinbase exchange/wallet and the Base network will be streamlined and user-friendly. Increased Liquidity (Potentially): As these wrapped assets become available and usable on Base, it could lead to increased trading volume and liquidity for these specific wrapped versions within the Base ecosystem. These potential benefits highlight how wrapping assets can unlock new functionalities and efficiencies for users within a specific network environment. Are There Any Challenges or Risks to Consider? While the potential benefits are exciting, it’s crucial to approach the launch of cbADA, cbDOGE, cbLTC, and cbXRP with a clear understanding of the associated risks. As with any wrapped tokens , certain considerations apply: Smart Contract Risk: The process of wrapping and unwrapping relies on smart contracts. If there is a vulnerability or bug in these contracts, it could potentially put the underlying native assets at risk. Counterparty Risk: Wrapped tokens work because a custodian (in this case, presumably Coinbase) holds the native assets in reserve, ideally in a 1:1 ratio with the wrapped tokens issued. Users are trusting Coinbase to securely hold the underlying ADA, DOGE, LTC, and XRP and to facilitate unwrapping when requested. Liquidity Risk: Initially, the liquidity for these wrapped tokens on Base might be low, making large swaps or transactions difficult or subject to significant price slippage. Distinguishing Native vs. Wrapped: Users must be careful to understand the difference between the native ADA, DOGE, LTC, or XRP and their wrapped ‘cb’ versions on Base. Sending a ‘cbDOGE’ token to a native Dogecoin address, for example, would likely result in a loss of funds. Regulatory Uncertainty (Especially XRP): While the wrapped tokens exist on Base, the underlying asset (XRP) has faced significant regulatory scrutiny in the US. How this might impact the wrapped version’s utility or availability on a US-centric platform like Coinbase remains a potential, albeit perhaps low, risk factor depending on evolving regulations. Dependency on Base Network: The utility of these wrapped tokens is tied directly to the health, performance, and adoption of the Coinbase Base network. Users should always perform their own due diligence and understand the specific mechanisms and risks involved before using any wrapped asset. Native vs. Wrapped: Understanding the Key Differences It’s vital not to confuse the original assets with their wrapped versions. Here’s a simple comparison: Feature Native ADA, DOGE, LTC, XRP cbADA, cbDOGE, cbLTC, cbXRP (Wrapped) Blockchain Cardano, Dogecoin, Litecoin, XRP Ledger (respectively) Coinbase Base (Layer 2) Primary Use Case Transactions on their native chains, network consensus, specific chain dApps Transactions on Base, participation in Base dApps/DeFi, potential Coinbase ecosystem integration Transaction Costs Vary depending on the native chain’s network activity Typically lower than native chain transactions due to Base’s Layer 2 nature Compatibility Only compatible with their respective native wallets and networks Compatible with wallets and protocols supporting tokens on the Base network Underlying Asset The original asset itself A token representing the original asset, held in reserve by a custodian (presumably Coinbase) This table highlights that while the value is intended to remain pegged 1:1 (minus minor market fluctuations or fees), the functional layer and associated risks are different. Actionable Insights: What Should You Do Next? Given that these assets are not yet live, now is the time to get informed. Here are some actionable steps: Stay Updated: Keep an eye on official announcements from Coinbase regarding the specific launch date and details for cbADA, cbDOGE, cbLTC, and cbXRP. Learn About Base: If you’re not familiar with the Coinbase Base network, take some time to understand how it works, its benefits, and how to use it. Understand Wrapped Tokens: Educate yourself thoroughly on the concept of wrapped tokens , the wrapping/unwrapping process, and the associated risks (smart contract, counterparty). Evaluate Potential Use Cases: Consider how you might use these wrapped assets once launched. Are you interested in exploring DeFi on Base? Do you want to trade these specific pairs with potentially lower fees? Assess Your Holdings: If you hold native ADA DOGE LTC XRP , think about whether you would want to wrap them to use on Base, or if you prefer to keep them on their native chains or on the main Coinbase exchange. Prioritize Security: When the assets launch, be extremely careful to use the correct network (Base) and understand which version of the token you are handling. Double-check addresses and network selections for all transactions. Being prepared is key to navigating new developments in the fast-paced crypto space. Conclusion: A Strategic Expansion for Coinbase and Base Coinbase’s plan to launch cbADA, cbDOGE, cbLTC, and cbXRP is a significant step in expanding the utility and reach of its Base Layer 2 network. By bringing these widely recognized crypto assets into the Base ecosystem as wrapped tokens , Coinbase is creating new possibilities for users, developers, and the assets themselves. While the potential benefits like lower fees, increased utility, and access to Base’s growing dApp landscape are compelling, users must also be aware of the inherent risks associated with wrapped assets, such as smart contract and counterparty risk. As the official launch date approaches, staying informed and understanding the nuances of these new tokens will be crucial for anyone looking to engage with them on the Coinbase Base platform. This move underscores Coinbase’s commitment to building out its own ecosystem and providing users with more ways to interact with their favorite ADA DOGE LTC XRP and other digital assets.

The Bangkok Post reported on May 13 that Finance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira announced the initiative at a briefing after the cabinet endorsed the plan. He added that the tokens will be launched within the next two months. The so-called “G-tokens” will be used to raise funds from the public under the current budget borrowing plan, said Patchara Anuntasilpa, director-general of the Public Debt Management Office. He added that these were not debt instruments. “One big selling point of the token is that it allows more retail investors to become part of the digital economy,” he said, adding that for as little as $3, “they can invest in government bonds.” Until recently, retail investors have been limited or excluded from large investment product offerings in Thailand, which are predominantly aimed at institutional and wealthy investors. Finance Minister Pichai said the initial token mint is designed to “test the market” and investors will earn higher returns than bank deposits, but did not specify yields. Commercial banks in Thailand offer very low interest rates to savers, currently just 1.25% for a 12-month fixed deposit, which is much lower than rates set by its central bank, which has kept rates elevated until recently despite increasing economic woes.

It would be tradable on licensed digital asset exchanges, which are not accessible to non-Thai citizens residing in the country. Government bonds are debt securities issued by the state to fund public spending. When investors buy them, they are essentially lending money to the government for a specified period in exchange for regular interest payments and the return of their principal at maturity. In February, Thailand’s securities regulator revealed plans to launch a tokenized securities trading system for institutional investors.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has taken a significant step regarding BlackRock’s popular IBIT ETF , signaling a potential shift in how these funds operate. This move is particularly focused on the mechanism by which investors redeem their shares, opening up a crucial discussion that could impact the efficiency and structure of these investment vehicles. SEC Seeks Feedback on In-Kind Redemption for BlackRock’s IBIT The core of the latest development revolves around the SEC’s decision to postpone its final ruling on whether to permit “in-kind” redemptions for BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF , IBIT. When the initial wave of spot Bitcoin ETFs, including IBIT, received approval in January 2024, the SEC mandated a “cash redemption” model. This meant that when an investor wanted to sell their ETF shares, the fund manager (like BlackRock) would sell the underlying Bitcoin and give the investor cash, rather than directly giving them Bitcoin. Now, the regulatory body is revisiting this decision and is actively seeking public comments on the proposal to allow in-kind redemptions. This request for feedback is a standard part of the SEC’s process when considering changes to previously approved structures, especially those with significant market implications. It indicates the SEC is carefully weighing the potential benefits and risks associated with this alternative redemption method. Understanding the Difference: Cash vs. In-Kind Redemption To fully grasp the importance of the SEC’s request, it’s essential to understand the two primary methods of ETF redemption: Cash Redemption: This is the model currently used by approved spot Bitcoin ETF s in the U.S. When an authorized participant (a large financial institution) wants to redeem ETF shares, they receive cash from the fund. The fund manager (e.g., BlackRock for IBIT ETF ) must sell the corresponding amount of Bitcoin on the open market to generate this cash. This process can potentially create taxable events within the fund itself, which may be passed on to ETF shareholders in the form of capital gains distributions, even if the shareholder hasn’t sold their shares. In-Kind Redemption: This is the model the SEC is considering allowing for IBIT and potentially other spot Bitcoin ETF s. When an authorized participant redeems shares, they receive the actual underlying asset – in this case, Bitcoin – directly from the fund, instead of cash. Conversely, for creation, authorized participants would give the fund Bitcoin in exchange for new ETF shares. This method is generally considered more tax-efficient for the fund and its shareholders because the transfer of the underlying asset (Bitcoin) during creation and redemption typically doesn’t trigger a taxable event for the fund itself. It is the standard model for many other commodity and equity ETFs. Why is In-Kind Redemption Preferred by Many? The preference for the in-kind model among many market participants, including asset managers like BlackRock, stems primarily from the potential for increased efficiency and tax advantages. Here’s why it matters: Tax Efficiency: As mentioned, the in-kind model minimizes taxable events within the fund. This can lead to better after-tax returns for investors holding the ETF shares long-term, as they are less likely to receive unexpected capital gains distributions. Reduced Trading Costs: The fund manager doesn’t constantly need to buy and sell Bitcoin on the market to facilitate cash redemptions, potentially reducing transaction costs. Lower Tracking Error: By directly exchanging Bitcoin for shares (and vice versa), the in-kind model can sometimes help the ETF’s price track the underlying asset’s price more closely, as it avoids the potential market impact and timing issues associated with cash transactions. Industry Standard: It aligns the structure of spot Bitcoin ETF s with that of many other established commodity and equity ETFs, which often operate on an in-kind basis. The SEC BlackRock Dialogue: What Are the Regulatory Concerns? While the in-kind model offers potential benefits, the SEC’s initial decision to mandate cash redemptions and its current request for feedback suggest lingering regulatory concerns. These concerns likely revolve around: Market Manipulation Risks: The SEC has historically been wary of the potential for manipulation in the underlying spot Bitcoin market. Allowing authorized participants to directly handle large volumes of Bitcoin during in-kind creations and redemptions might introduce new complexities or perceived risks related to market integrity, depending on the specific mechanisms and participants involved. Custody and Transfer of Bitcoin: Handling large transfers of Bitcoin between authorized participants and the fund requires robust custody solutions and secure transfer protocols. The SEC needs to be comfortable that these processes are secure and compliant. Investor Protection: Ensuring the process is transparent, fair, and doesn’t disadvantage retail investors is paramount for the SEC. Regulatory Framework: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Applying the in-kind model, standard for traditional assets, to a novel asset class like Bitcoin requires careful consideration within the existing regulatory framework. The current public comment period allows the SEC to gather insights from a wide range of stakeholders – investors, market makers, asset managers, compliance experts, and the general public – on how these concerns might be addressed or if they outweigh the benefits of the in-kind model for products like the IBIT ETF . The Public Comment Process: Your Voice Matters The SEC’s request for public comments is a critical part of its rulemaking and decision-making process. It provides an opportunity for anyone interested to submit their views, data, and analysis on the proposal. This feedback helps the commission understand the potential impacts, both positive and negative, from various perspectives. Individuals and organizations can typically submit comments through the SEC’s website, referencing the specific rule or proposal number. The SEC is obligated to review and consider all comments received before making a final determination. This is your chance to weigh in on the future structure of U.S. Bitcoin ETF s and the broader landscape of crypto regulation . What’s Next for IBIT ETF and the Future of Crypto Regulation ? The SEC’s decision on in-kind redemptions for IBIT could set a precedent for other spot Bitcoin ETF s currently operating under the cash-only model. If approved, it could lead to: Improved tax efficiency for long-term ETF holders. Potentially lower operational costs for fund managers. Increased alignment with traditional ETF structures. A signal regarding the SEC’s evolving comfort level with the operational aspects of handling Bitcoin within regulated financial products. Conversely, if the SEC decides against allowing in-kind redemptions, the cash model will remain the standard, potentially keeping tax implications and operational complexities higher than they otherwise might be. The outcome of this decision will be a key indicator of the direction of crypto regulation in the U.S. and its approach to integrating digital assets into mainstream finance. Benefits and Challenges at a Glance Here’s a quick summary of the potential impacts of allowing in-kind redemptions: Potential Benefits: Enhanced tax efficiency for investors Reduced internal fund trading costs Improved tracking accuracy Alignment with standard ETF practices Potential Challenges/Concerns (from a regulatory perspective): Potential market manipulation risks in the underlying asset Operational complexities of handling Bitcoin transfers Ensuring robust custody and security Navigating the evolving crypto regulation landscape Conclusion The SEC’s request for public feedback on allowing in-kind redemptions for BlackRock’s IBIT ETF is a pivotal moment for the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF market. While the current cash redemption model was a necessary compromise for initial approval, the potential shift to an in-kind model could bring significant benefits, particularly in terms of tax efficiency for investors. However, regulatory concerns surrounding the unique nature of Bitcoin and its market persist. The outcome of this review process, heavily influenced by the public comments received, will not only shape the future operations of funds like the IBIT ETF but also provide valuable insight into the SEC’s ongoing approach to integrating digital assets into the regulated financial system. It’s a development worth watching closely for anyone invested in or following the intersection of traditional finance and cryptocurrencies.

Thanks to a solid technical setup and growing interest in its DeFi ecosystem, the price has increased 6% over the last day and 22% over the last week. Solana’s ( SOL ) open interest has also risen by 11.08%, as per Coinglass data . This implies that there are more traders entering the market with new contracts, which usually indicates growing investor confidence. According to DeFiLlama data , Solana’s total value locked increased from $7.5 billion at the beginning of May to $9.6 billion at the time of writing. Leading the charge have been platforms like Marinade (up 56%), Jito (up 41%), and Raydium (up 78%). Additionally, weekly decentralized exchange volumes increased, rising from $18 billion the week before to $22 billion last week. Chain activity remains strong. Revenues and transaction fees on Solana have been steadily climbing for four weeks, nearing three-month highs. With 65% of SOL staked, a combination of the demand from DeFi usage and the limited supply could support price growth. But not every metric is positive. Solana’s overall stablecoin market capitalization dropped by 8% to $11.7 billion in the past seven days. At 8%, the funding rate indicates that traders are paying more to hold long positions, which is a sign of bullish sentiment but also one that frequently precedes short-term corrections.

However, overbought conditions are indicated by the relative strength index, which is at 71. Solana price analysis. Credit: crypto.news The Bollinger Bands are widening, and SOL is now trading close to the upper band. This typically comes before a period of correction or consolidation and indicates high volatility. Immediate resistance lies near $185, the top of the current band. A breakout above this could open the path to $200. On the downside, support is seen around $157 (20-day EMA) and $130, where the lower Bollinger band and previous consolidation zone align. Looking ahead, bullish momentum could continue if SOL breaks above $185 with volume. A rejection here, however, may trigger a pullback to support levels. While SOL remains 39% below its all-time high of $295, growing institutional interest, possible ETF approval, and upcoming upgrades like Firedancer suggest that the road to $200 seems more likely if market conditions hold.

Here’s The Truth,https://coinpedia.org/news/is-nvidia-buying-bitcoin-heres-the-truth/,"The post Is Nvidia Buying Bitcoin? Here’s The Truth appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A new wave of speculation has hit the crypto and tech communities. Will Nvidia, the AI and GPU giant, follow in the footsteps of MicroStrategy and Tesla by adding Bitcoin to its treasury? While there’s no official confirmation, the rumors have sparked a wider debate about whether Bitcoin could be a strategic play for Nvidia amid growing market pressures. What’s Fueling the Rumor? Is Nvidia Considering Adding Bitcoin to its Balance Sheet? h/t @Barchart pic.twitter.com/6jXoogXOGc — Lark Davis (@TheCryptoLark) May 6, 2025 Over recent weeks, social media chatter has hinted at Nvidia considering Bitcoin as a treasury asset. The company hasn’t commented, and there’s no evidence to confirm the reports. However, the idea isn’t far-fetched, especially given the economic turbulence Nvidia is currently facing. Following the news, the tech powerhouse, which has been a dominant player in AI and GPU technology, has seen its stock drop around 35% since January. Pressure from US tariffs , global inflation, and increasing competition, particularly from China’s Huawei, has added to the weight. Some believe that diversifying into Bitcoin could help Nvidia navigate this uncertain environment. Why Bitcoin Might Make Sense for Nvidia Industry experts say a Bitcoin allocation could position Nvidia as a visionary player aligned with the future of finance. Bitcoin’s fixed supply and independence from traditional markets make it an appealing hedge against inflation, something forward-looking companies are increasingly considering. Banxe CEO Alex Guts pointed out that over 630,000 BTC is now held by corporate treasuries, showing growing institutional adoption . Nvidia’s past ties to crypto mining, its GPUs were once the backbone of mining rigs, could further justify a move into Bitcoin. Moreover, adding Bitcoin could also boost Nvidia’s image with younger, tech-savvy investors and employees who already support crypto initiatives. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Semler Scientific Reports 21.9% BTC Yield in Q1: Company Now Holds 3,808 Bitcoin , But It’s Not All Rosy Despite the potential upsides, Bitcoin is notoriously volatile. That could bring new risks to Nvidia’s financials, especially since current accounting rules treat Bitcoin as an “intangible asset,” meaning losses would hit the books hard, even if not realized. CoinShares analyst Satish Patel noted that Nvidia already uses foreign exchange hedging to manage inflation risks. So while Bitcoin could diversify Nvidia’s assets, it may not be essential. Dean Chen of Bitunix warned that Bitcoin’s short-term swings could be damaging rather than helpful unless Nvidia takes a long-term approach. So, Will Nvidia Take the Leap? There’s no official word yet, and while Nvidia has the financial cushion to take on Bitcoin’s volatility, the move would need to align with a broader long-term vision, not just serve as a quick fix for falling stock prices. For now, the buzz remains just that, rumors. But even talk of such a move signals how far Bitcoin has come in gaining corporate attention. If Nvidia does decide to jump in, it could further reshape how the market views crypto as a legitimate corporate asset. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Separately, the Trump administration issued new guidance clarifying that the use of Huawei Technologies’ Ascend AI chips “anywhere in the world” violates US export controls. Officials also warned of potential consequences for allowing US-developed AI chips to be used in training Chinese AI models. Markets are now focused on President Trump’s upcoming visit to the Middle East, timed with peak fuel demand, with oil price stability likely a key objective.

Robinhood announced its $179 million acquisition of WonderFi, a company that owns two of Canada’s leading regulated crypto platforms, Bitbuy and Coinsquare. Meanwhile, Coinbase is investing in Canadian stablecoin issuer Stablecorp to promote the adoption of QCAD, a tokenized version of the Canadian dollar. Coinbase and Stablecorp Partner to Push Canadian Dollar Stablecoin Amid Regulatory Hurdles Coinbase has announced a strategic partnership with Stablecorp, the Canadian fintech firm behind the QCAD stablecoin. The collaboration, revealed during the Blockchain Futurist Conference in Toronto, includes an undisclosed investment by Coinbase and a joint marketing campaign to boost adoption of QCAD — a fiat-backed, tokenized version of the Canadian dollar. Stablecorp’s flagship product QCAD, (Source: Stablecorp ) Lucas Matheson, CEO of Coinbase Canada, said in a recent interview that stablecoins are “especially urgent” for Canadian users, citing the country’s outdated payment infrastructure. “It’s really important that we have a stablecoin for Canadians,” Matheson emphasized, highlighting how “wire transfers cost $45 and take 45 minutes of paperwork” in Canada. “Canada has no peer-to-peer payment rail,” he added. “With stablecoins, 24/7, instant, borderless payments become possible — this is already feasible with existing tech.” Addressing Canada’s Payment Bottlenecks The push for QCAD adoption is part of a larger trend in which financial institutions are embracing blockchain technology to enable faster, cheaper, and more accessible financial transactions. While global stablecoin leaders like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) dominate with a combined market cap exceeding $245 billion, homegrown options like QCAD remain niche due to a host of structural and regulatory challenges. Stablecorp's QCAD — one of the first fiat-backed stablecoins denominated in Canadian dollars — is backed 1:1 with Canadian fiat reserves. However, as of July 2024, the company reported that only around $175,000 worth of QCAD were in circulation, underscoring the slow pace of local adoption. “Canada lacks a clear path for stablecoin adoption,” Coinbase said in a March 26 blog post , attributing the issue to ongoing legal ambiguity. “Fiat-backed stablecoins need to be treated as payment instruments rather than securities,” the exchange urged, adding that the current framework hinders innovation and widespread use. The announcement comes at a pivotal time for the Canadian crypto industry. Just last month, Mark Carney — a former governor of the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England — was elected as the country’s new Prime Minister. Known for his skepticism toward cryptocurrencies, Carney’s leadership introduces new questions about the government’s approach to digital assets. Nevertheless, Matheson expressed optimism: “We’re asking the federal government to develop a national strategy for digital assets. Crypto is strategic, and we hope this new administration sees that.” The comments reflect a growing consensus among Canadian crypto executives that the federal government must catch up to jurisdictions like the United States, where regulators are starting to differentiate between payment-focused stablecoins and speculative digital assets. In April, the US Securities and Exchange Commission clarified that stablecoins marketed strictly as payment tools do not qualify as securities — a regulatory position that Coinbase believes Canada should emulate. The Future of QCAD and Canadian Crypto For Coinbase, the partnership with Stablecorp is not just about pushing a new stablecoin — it’s about laying the foundation for a more inclusive, cost-effective, and modern financial system in Canada. If successful, QCAD could provide Canadians with a stable and regulated on-chain alternative to traditional bank transfers and help close the payment efficiency gap that has left the country behind other G7 economies. Stablecorp has yet to release a new reserve report since July 2024, a fact that may raise transparency concerns for potential users. Still, the involvement of a global giant like Coinbase may lend the project the credibility and scale it needs to break through to mainstream use. Robinhood to Acquire WonderFi for $179 Million in Strategic Canadian Expansion In related news, Robinhood Markets Inc., the popular US-based fintech known for pioneering commission-free stock and crypto trading, has announced its latest international push with the acquisition of Canadian crypto firm WonderFi in a $250 million CAD ($179 million USD) all-cash deal. The acquisition, set to close in the second half of 2025, marks another step in Robinhood’s global expansion and deepening commitment to the crypto sector. According to Robinhood’s May 13 press release, the deal will bring WonderFi’s full suite of digital asset platforms under the company’s umbrella, including Bitbuy and Coinsquare — two of Canada’s oldest and most regulated crypto trading platforms. The acquisition will significantly bolster Robinhood’s presence in the Canadian market and grant access to more than 2.1 billion CAD in assets under custody across WonderFi’s platforms. “WonderFi has built a formidable family of brands serving beginner and advanced crypto users alike, making them an ideal partner to accelerate Robinhood’s mission in Canada,” said Johann Kerbrat, senior vice president and general manager of Robinhood Crypto. WonderFi, a publicly traded company on the Toronto Stock Exchange, has spent the past several years consolidating Canada’s fragmented crypto market. In 2024, the firm processed over 3.57 billion CAD in trading volume — a 28% increase year-over-year — while providing staking and custody services in addition to core crypto trading. Wonderfi share price surges after deal announcement (Source: Google Finance ) The acquisition offer of 0.36 CAD per share represents a 41% premium over WonderFi’s last closing price and a 71% premium over its 30-day volume-weighted average. Before the deal was announced, WonderFi’s market capitalization stood at 163.9 million CAD, with its stock having declined 13.6% year-to-date. Subject to shareholder, regulatory, and court approvals, the deal could mark a significant reshaping of the Canadian crypto industry, with Robinhood set to inherit a key foothold in a region that has yet to fully embrace retail digital asset adoption at scale. Riding the 2025 Crypto M&A Wave Robinhood’s move comes amid a broader surge in cryptocurrency mergers and acquisitions fueled by improved regulatory clarity under US President Donald Trump’s administration. Companies are seizing the opportunity to scale globally, attract new users, and expand into strategic markets. In just the first half of 2025, the crypto industry has seen several landmark acquisitions. Coinbase acquired crypto derivatives exchange Deribit for $2.9 billion, and Ripple bought prime brokerage platform Hidden Road for $1.25 billion. Earlier this month, Kraken completed its acquisition of NinjaTrader, enabling the platform to offer crypto derivatives in the US market. Robinhood itself has been particularly active in expanding its crypto footprint. Last year, it acquired Bitstamp for $200 million, giving the firm access to institutional-grade infrastructure and clients. More recently, reports surfaced that Robinhood is developing a blockchain network to help European retail investors trade US securities — a move that could position it as a global financial superapp. While Canada has developed a more structured regulatory environment for crypto firms than many jurisdictions, it remains a cautious market. WonderFi’s operations under Canadian regulators will offer Robinhood a streamlined entry point into the country’s crypto space with compliant infrastructure already in place. Still, the deal must pass several layers of approval — including from WonderFi shareholders, regulatory agencies, and the courts. Should it go through, the acquisition will likely accelerate Robinhood’s capacity to offer more crypto services to Canadians, possibly including access to its broader trading ecosystem, which merges traditional equities and digital assets under one platform.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-14 05:30:00
44597043,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=160124,1747200602,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Coinbase Investment: A Breakthrough for Canadian Stablecoins and Crypto Payments,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/coinbase-invests-canadian-stablecoin/,"In a move set to potentially reshape the landscape of digital finance in the Great White North, Coinbase , one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, has made a significant Coinbase investment in Canadian stablecoin issuer, Stablecorp. This strategic partnership aims to bolster the adoption and utility of Stablecorp QCAD , a Canadian dollar-backed stablecoin, paving the way for faster, more efficient crypto payments across Canada. Why is Coinbase Betting on Stablecorp QCAD? The core motivation behind Coinbase’s investment is clear: to address the existing inefficiencies within Canada’s payment systems. According to reports, Stablecorp CEO Lucas Matheson highlighted the pressing need for payment solutions that are not only faster but also significantly lower in cost compared to traditional methods. This aligns perfectly with the inherent advantages offered by stablecoins like QCAD. Stablecorp QCAD is designed to maintain a stable value pegged 1:1 with the Canadian dollar. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, QCAD offers the stability of fiat currency combined with the speed, transparency, and cost-effectiveness of blockchain technology. This makes it an ideal candidate for everyday transactions, remittances, and business payments where price stability is paramount. Coinbase’s backing provides Stablecorp with crucial capital and, perhaps more importantly, the endorsement and potential integration opportunities from a global crypto giant. This can accelerate QCAD’s reach and utility within the Canadian market and potentially beyond. The Push for Clear Stablecoin Regulation in Canada Beyond the direct investment, Coinbase is actively engaging with Canadian regulators. A key part of their strategy involves advocating for stablecoins to be classified and treated as payment instruments rather than securities. This distinction is critical for broader adoption. Treating stablecoins solely as securities could subject them to stringent regulatory requirements designed for investment products, potentially hindering their use as a medium of exchange for goods and services. By advocating for a payments-focused regulatory framework, Coinbase aims to create a clearer, more favorable environment for stablecoins like Stablecorp QCAD to thrive as a viable payment option for individuals and businesses. This advocacy is not unique to Canada; exchanges and stablecoin issuers globally are pushing for regulatory clarity that acknowledges the dual nature of stablecoins – potentially an investment vehicle in some contexts, but primarily a payment tool in others. Success in establishing a clear regulatory path in Canada could serve as a model for other jurisdictions. Understanding the Canadian Stablecoin Landscape While the global stablecoin market is dominated by tokens pegged to the US dollar (like USDT, USDC), the demand for stablecoins pegged to other fiat currencies, such as the Canadian dollar, is growing. A Canadian stablecoin like QCAD offers specific advantages for Canadian residents and businesses: Reduced Exchange Risk: No need to worry about CAD/USD exchange rate fluctuations when using QCAD for domestic transactions. Local Relevance: Directly aligns with the national currency, making it more intuitive for Canadian users. Support for the Canadian Economy: Potentially keeps value within the Canadian financial ecosystem. Prior to QCAD, the options for Canadian dollar-pegged stablecoins were limited. Stablecorp’s offering fills this gap, providing a much-needed digital asset that reflects the local economy. Coinbase’s investment signals confidence in the potential for significant growth in the Canadian stablecoin market. Benefits of Stablecoins for Crypto Payments Why are stablecoins considered transformative for payments? Their advantages over traditional methods and volatile cryptocurrencies are compelling: Speed: Transactions can settle in minutes, regardless of geographical location or banking hours. Cost-Effectiveness: Transaction fees are typically much lower than traditional wire transfers or international payments. Accessibility: Available 24/7 to anyone with internet access and a crypto wallet, potentially banking the unbanked. Programmability: Can be integrated into smart contracts for automated payments, escrow, and other complex financial operations. Stability: Value is pegged to a stable asset (like CAD), eliminating the price volatility risk associated with using assets like Bitcoin for payments. For businesses, adopting Stablecorp QCAD could mean faster settlement of invoices, reduced transaction costs, and new opportunities for integrating payments into digital platforms. For individuals, it could offer a cheaper way to send money domestically or internationally. Challenges and Opportunities for Stablecorp QCAD Adoption Despite the significant boost from the Coinbase investment, Stablecorp QCAD faces challenges on the path to widespread adoption: Regulatory Uncertainty: While advocacy is ongoing, the lack of definitive stablecoin regulation in Canada remains a hurdle. Businesses need clarity before fully committing. Awareness and Education: Many Canadians are still unfamiliar with stablecoins and how they differ from other cryptocurrencies. Significant effort is needed for public education. Integration with Existing Systems: Seamless integration with existing financial infrastructure, point-of-sale systems, and e-commerce platforms is crucial for convenience. Competition: While QCAD is a prominent Canadian stablecoin, it faces competition from other potential entrants and, indirectly, from established payment networks. Scaling Infrastructure: As adoption grows, the underlying blockchain infrastructure needs to scale efficiently and securely. However, these challenges also present opportunities. The early-mover advantage in the Canadian stablecoin space, coupled with Coinbase’s support, positions Stablecorp well. The increasing global trend towards digital payments and the exploration of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) also creates a favorable environment for stablecoin discussions and adoption. Actionable Insights for the Canadian Market What does this development mean for different stakeholders in Canada? For Businesses: Explore integrating QCAD as a payment option. Research potential cost savings and efficiency gains. Stay informed about regulatory developments. For Consumers: Learn about QCAD and stablecoins. Consider using wallets that support QCAD for sending/receiving payments. Understand the risks and benefits. For Developers: Look into building applications and services that leverage QCAD for payments or other financial functionalities. For Regulators: Engage with industry participants like Coinbase and Stablecorp to develop a clear, proportionate regulatory framework that fosters innovation while protecting consumers and financial stability. The investment serves as a strong signal that major players view the Canadian market as ripe for digital payment innovation, particularly through stablecoins. The Future of Crypto Payments in Canada Coinbase’s investment in Stablecorp is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a strategic move aimed at accelerating the adoption of stablecoins for real-world use cases in Canada. By backing Stablecorp QCAD and advocating for sensible stablecoin regulation , Coinbase is actively working to lower the barriers to entry for crypto payments and digital finance within the country. The success of QCAD and other stablecoins in Canada will likely depend on a combination of technological development, regulatory clarity, and public acceptance. This investment is a significant step forward, providing the resources and momentum needed to tackle these factors head-on. It highlights the growing global trend of integrating digital assets into mainstream financial activities, starting with fundamental functions like payments. Summary: A New Chapter for Canadian Digital Finance The Coinbase investment in Stablecorp marks a pivotal moment for the Canadian stablecoin market and the future of crypto payments in the country. By supporting Stablecorp QCAD and advocating for progressive stablecoin regulation , Coinbase is championing the cause of faster, cheaper, and more accessible digital transactions. While challenges remain, this partnership injects significant momentum into the effort to make stablecoins a common tool for everyday finance in Canada, potentially unlocking new economic opportunities and driving innovation in the digital economy.

The asset recorded a 20% rise on the weekly chart before retreating slightly. At the time of writing, XRP trades at $2.54, reflecting a 2% decline in the past 24 hours. Despite the minor dip, the asset remains well above recent local lows and is showing signs of growing trader interest. According to a new analysis shared by CryptoQuant contributor BorisVest, activity in XRP derivatives on Binance indicates potential accumulation amid increasing speculative interest. Related Reading: XRP Price To Rally To $6: Partially Completed Wave 5 Says There’s Still Room To Run The market, which previously saw a steep drop in open interest, is now witnessing a resurgence in leveraged trading positions. These on-chain dynamics may be hinting at a shift in sentiment as participants return following the earlier flush-out. XRP Open Interest Rebounds as Traders Re-Enter the Market Open interest, defined as the total number of active futures contracts not yet settled—serves as a gauge for market engagement. When open interest increases alongside price, it often suggests rising speculative participation. In XRP’s case, the data shows a sharp rebound from a previous $530 million low to a higher range, suggesting a recovery in market confidence after a significant drop from its $1.5 billion peak. BorisVest also analyzed Binance funding rates, which reflect the cost of maintaining long or short positions in perpetual futures. These rates become positive when long positions dominate and negative when short interest prevails. During XRP’s recent correction, the funding rate turned negative, indicating an influx of short positions and setting up conditions for a possible short squeeze. A short squeeze occurs when short sellers are forced to buy back their positions due to rising prices, often resulting in rapid upward price movements. Currently, the funding rate is neutral, suggesting equilibrium between bullish and bearish positions, though subtle signals point to increasing short exposure. Taker Sell Pressure Meets Steady Price: Signs of Absorption? Another metric underlined in the analysis is the Taker Buy/Sell Ratio. This indicator compares the volume of aggressive buy orders (market buys) against sell orders (market sells). A ratio below 1 implies that sellers are more aggressive. In this case, XRP’s Taker Buy/Sell Ratio stands at 0.91, meaning selling pressure dominates. However, the absence of significant price declines despite the pressure implies potential absorption by larger players, which can be a precursor to bullish price movements. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Must Clear This Level Or Risk Crash To $1.9 The combination of rising open interest, neutral funding rates, and sustained price levels despite sell pressure suggests that XRP may be experiencing silent accumulation. While the market remains indecisive, these patterns are often observed in the early stages of a trend reversal or breakout. As speculative activity picks up, it could be worth monitoring these signals closely for further confirmation. Whether this leads to a continuation of XRP’s rally or not, the current data points to a market that is actively recalibrating, and possibly preparing for the next phase in price action.

At the same time the agency invited public comments on BlackRock’s plan to shift its flagship Bitcoin ETF to an in-kind redemption model and on Nasdaq’s bid to list the 21Shares Dogecoin ETF. The moves underscore Washington’s cautious yet increasingly structured approach to bringing a wider range of crypto assets into the regulated fund universe. Solana Trust Under Microscope Staff will spend the coming weeks determining whether Grayscale’s Solana Trust satisfies investor-protection and market-integrity requirements set out in Section 6(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act. If approved the vehicle would hold SOL tokens in cold storage and trade on NYSE Arca, giving retail investors indirect exposure without setting up self-custody. The SEC has up to 240 days—and multiple chances to pause the clock—before issuing a final ruling, meaning the earliest green light could slip past September. Litecoin Also Waits Grayscale’s Litecoin Trust received a parallel delay as commissioners opened formal proceedings to gather additional evidence and rebuttals. Questions center on whether Litecoin markets are sufficiently surveilled to detect manipulation and whether existing futures oversight on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange offers a viable benchmark. Both altcoin filings remain on hold until staff completes the deeper dive mandated by Tuesday’s notice. BlackRock Reworks Bitcoin Redemption Model Separately, Nasdaq’s filing to amend the iShares Bitcoin Trust is now in a 21-day comment window that will test appetite for so-called in-kind redemptions. Under the proposal authorized participants could exchange ETF shares directly for Bitcoin rather than cash, a structure BlackRock says would reduce tracking error and capital-gains events. The SEC approved the fund in January with a cash-only mechanism but signaled openness to alternative workflows once operational safeguards were in place. Industry lawyers expect a decision on the amendment before the fourth quarter, provided no major objections arise during the rebuttal phase. Dogecoin ETF Opens to Feedback Nasdaq also submitted paperwork to list the 21Shares Dogecoin ETF under Rule 5711(d), the same framework used for commodity-based trust shares like gold. The passive fund intends to mirror Dogecoin’s price via a CF Benchmarks reference rate and store coins with regulated custodian Coinbase. Backers view the meme-coin product as a litmus test for how far the SEC is willing to extend spot-crypto approvals beyond the large-cap duo of Bitcoin and Ether. Why the SEC Is Pressing Pause New Chair Paul Atkins has vowed to replace the previous regime’s enforcement-first posture with clearer rulemaking but insists each novel ETF “meets the law as written.” Delays allow staff to solicit data on trading volumes, offshore liquidity, and correlation between spot and futures prices—metrics commissioners say are key to detecting wash trades. The agency also weighs whether surveillance-sharing agreements with major platforms will meaningfully curb insider manipulation before retail money can flow in. Altcoin ETF Pipeline Widens At least a dozen issuers, including 21Shares, Bitwise, and WisdomTree, have registered or signaled intent to launch funds tied to XRP, Avalanche, and even meme-tokens like Shiba Inu. Bloomberg Intelligence estimates that more than $15 billion could migrate into altcoin funds within two years if the SEC gives even a handful the green light. For now, however, only Bitcoin and Ether spot products have crossed the finish line, and both required multiyear legal tussles. Market Reaction and Outlook Prices for SOL and LTC drifted lower after the notice, though most analysts attributed the dip to broader risk-off sentiment rather than the procedural delay. Dogecoin held steady near $0.28 as traders judged the start of a comment period to be net positive, keeping hopes alive for a first-of-its-kind meme-coin ETF. Strategists at Galaxy Digital wrote in a note that the SEC’s staggered approach “signals momentum, not resistance,” provided applicants can supply robust market-surveillance data. Still, they cautioned that a single high-profile hack or manipulation incident could prompt regulators to reapply the brakes. Timeline From Here Commenters have until June 4 to weigh in on BlackRock’s amendment and until June 7 on the Dogecoin proposal, after which rebuttals may be filed for an additional 35 days. The Solana and Litecoin dockets now await a second SEC extension, a step that would push the ultimate decision into early autumn. Market participants will track those deadlines closely, viewing each incremental action as a barometer of how quickly U.S. regulators are prepared to mainstream the next wave of crypto assets.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|LTC|REGULATION|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-05-14 05:34:44

As the country heads toward its June 3 presidential election, the Democratic Party has placed digital assets at the heart of its campaign, forming a dedicated Digital Asset Committee to take control of regulation and reform. South Korea Crypto Law The committee held its first meeting on May 13 at the National Assembly in Seoul, bringing together lawmakers, government officials, and top figures from local exchanges like Upbit, Bithumb, Coinbit, and Gopax. Its goal is clear: centralize crypto policymaking under the president’s office. Lawmaker Min Byeong-deok, who chairs the group, said the structure is meant to drive real policy, not just discussions. The committee is already at work drafting key legislation, including the much-anticipated “Stage 2 Bill” that will shape South Korea’s digital asset framework. Committee Chairman Min Byeong-deok also criticized the country’s current “one exchange, one bank” system, calling it limiting for crypto businesses. The group plans to work with regulators to update this framework and explore whether stablecoins should require licensing or simple reporting. Two core divisions are leading the charge, one focused on tech innovation, the other on building regulatory systems. Four subgroups will cover user protection, legal reform, industry growth, and external cooperation. Stablecoins Take Center Stage One of the major discussion points is stablecoins , especially those pegged to the Korean won. Democratic Party candidate Lee Jae-myung is pushing for quick market entry, even proposing a won-linked stablecoin. But memories of the Terra-Luna collapse are still fresh, and critics are calling for caution. There’s still no clear answer on whether stablecoins should require a license or just registration. Even the question of who should oversee them, the Bank of Korea or the Financial Services Commission, remains unresolved. Min acknowledged that current banking partnerships with exchanges are limiting growth and need reform. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : NYC Mayor Eric Adams Wants New York City To Be The Crypto Capital , Central Bank Isn’t Backing Down The Bank of Korea has made its stance clear. Just before the committee’s debut, BOK officials insisted they must have the final say on KRW-based stablecoins. The central bank warned that excluding them from early-stage discussions could destabilize national monetary policy. Koh Kyung-chul from the BOK’s electronic finance division called for legal frameworks that protect financial stability before innovation. Crypto as a Campaign Battleground With over 16 million South Koreans in crypto, the upcoming election is turning into a digital finance showdown. Lee Jae-myung aims to boost innovation and prevent capital flight, while Kim Moon-soo backs public fund investment and regulatory reforms. Crypto is now a central issue shaping South Korea’s financial future. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Recently, CoinShares, a prominent player in this space, released its Q1 earnings report, revealing a significant dip in profitability that has caught the attention of investors and market watchers alike. The headline figure? A substantial 42.2% year-on-year decline in net profit for the first quarter. Understanding CoinShares and Its Q1 Earnings CoinShares is a well-established digital asset management group, known for its wide range of exchange-traded products (ETPs) and investment solutions focused on cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Their business model is heavily influenced by the performance and trading volume within the digital asset market. Therefore, their quarterly financial results serve as a key indicator not just of the company’s performance, but also of the prevailing crypto market trends. For the first quarter, CoinShares reported a net profit of $24 million. While still a considerable sum, this represents a sharp decrease compared to the same period in the previous year. This decline in Q1 earnings highlights the challenging operating environment encountered during the early months of the year. What Caused the Decline in Financial Results? According to the report, the primary culprit behind the reduced profitability was the impact of macroeconomic headwinds. But what exactly does that mean in the context of digital assets and CoinShares’ business? Macroeconomic headwinds refer to large-scale economic conditions that negatively affect business growth and profitability. In Q1, these factors included: Rising Inflation: Persistent high inflation prompted central banks globally to signal or begin interest rate hikes. Interest Rate Hikes: Tighter monetary policy generally reduces investor appetite for riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies. Geopolitical Tensions: Events like conflicts can increase market uncertainty and volatility, leading investors to move towards safer assets. Recession Fears: Growing concerns about a potential economic slowdown or recession can dampen overall investment activity. These factors collectively created a challenging backdrop for digital assets. Increased market volatility, coupled with a general risk-off sentiment among investors, led to reduced trading volumes and potentially lower assets under management (AUM) or slower AUM growth for firms like CoinShares. Since CoinShares’ revenue is often linked to AUM and trading fees, a downturn in market activity directly impacts their financial results. How Do Macroeconomic Headwinds Impact Digital Asset Management? The business of digital asset management thrives when the market is bullish, attracting new investors and increasing the value of existing holdings. Conversely, during periods of significant market stress or downturns driven by macroeconomic factors, several challenges emerge: Reduced Assets Under Management (AUM): As cryptocurrency prices fall, the value of the assets managed by firms like CoinShares decreases, directly impacting fee income which is often calculated as a percentage of AUM. Lower Trading Volume: In uncertain markets, investors may trade less frequently, reducing the revenue generated from transaction fees or trading-related services. Increased Redemptions: Some investors may choose to withdraw their investments during downturns, further decreasing AUM. Difficulty Launching New Products: A bearish sentiment can make it harder to attract investment into new digital asset products or funds. The 42% drop in CoinShares’ net profit is a clear illustration of how susceptible even leading digital asset management firms are to the broader economic climate and prevailing crypto market trends. What Does This Tell Us About Crypto Market Trends in Q1? CoinShares’ financial results corroborate the narrative that Q1 was a tough period for the cryptocurrency market. While there may have been intermittent rallies, the dominant trend was one of caution and price depreciation for many major digital assets, influenced heavily by the macroeconomic environment. This makes the Q1 earnings report from CoinShares not just company news, but also a valuable data point for understanding the overall market sentiment and performance during that time. Navigating the Challenges: What’s Next? Facing a decline in financial results due to external pressures is a challenge, but it also prompts strategic responses. Digital asset management firms in such environments often focus on cost management, product innovation (perhaps exploring less volatile strategies or new asset classes), and strengthening their balance sheets to weather the downturn. For investors and those following crypto market trends, CoinShares’ report serves as a reminder that the digital asset space is not immune to global economic forces. Understanding the interplay between macroeconomic factors and cryptocurrency performance is crucial for making informed decisions. While the Q1 earnings showed a significant drop, it’s important to consider this within the context of a challenging quarter for the entire industry. The ability of firms like CoinShares to navigate these periods will be key to their long-term success and the continued maturation of the digital asset management sector. Summary: A Sobering Look at Q1 Financial Results CoinShares’ report of a 42% year-on-year drop in Q1 net profit to $24 million underscores the significant impact of macroeconomic headwinds on the digital asset management industry. The challenging crypto market trends driven by factors like inflation and interest rate hikes directly affected the company’s financial results, leading to reduced profitability. This serves as a stark reminder that while the digital asset space offers unique opportunities, it remains connected to and influenced by the broader global economic landscape. The performance of key players like CoinShares provides valuable insights into the health and challenges facing the sector.

The predictions follow renewed momentum in the broader cryptocurrency market, driven by Bitcoin’s recent surge above $100,000. XRP has participated in this recovery, trading around $2.40 as of the latest data and attempting to consolidate within the higher end of the $2 range . Several analysts believe this consolidation could precede a major breakout, with historical precedents and chart patterns indicating further gains. Technical Patterns Supporting the $7 Target One of the more prominent voices supporting a bullish outlook for XRP is market analyst Mags. He previously forecasted XRP’s rally from below $0.50, a prediction that materialized as the asset gained nearly 600% between November 2024 and January 2025. That surge took XRP to a peak of $3.4 before a correction drove it into a consolidation phase near $2, where it has remained since February. $XRP is going to $7 Shared XRP below $0.5 before it went 6x. The current consolidation looks similar to what we saw back in 2017-18 before the blow off top. Expecting something similar. easy 2-3x from here.. https://t.co/GG8uHFwRvK pic.twitter.com/b9juSGSp5y — Mags (@thescalpingpro) May 10, 2025 Mags argues that XRP’s current pattern is similar to its price structure from 2017 to 2018. According to his analysis, the asset typically undergoes four phases during a market cycle: a first bounce, accumulation, a parabolic run, and a blow-off top. The analyst believes XRP is now transitioning into the final phase. Referring to historical price action from 2017, Mags noted that XRP had a parabolic phase from March to May, then consolidated for 6 months before the blow-off top.” Applying this framework to the present market, he projects a potential rise to $7.3 from the current range, representing a 202% increase. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Breakout from Multi-Year Pattern Signals $15 Possibility While Mags sees $7.3 as a realistic target, other analysts foresee an even larger rally. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has identified a breakout from a symmetrical triangle pattern formed over nearly seven years, from January 2018 through November 2024. This breakout after the 2024 U.S. elections propelled XRP above the $2 mark. Martinez maintains that the triangle breakout remains influential and expects XRP to extend its gains significantly. He noted XRP could rise to $15, representing a 522% increase from current levels. This projection is rooted in the typical behavior of assets following a breakout from such long-term formations. RSI Trends Reinforce the Bullish Outlook Additional confirmation of XRP’s potential upward trajectory comes from the analyst behind the Crypto Crew University platform. In a recent analysis, he emphasized that the asset replicates an RSI (Relative Strength Index) behavior seen during previous market cycles. He stated that XRP may be entering another RSI surge similar to those observed in 2017 and 2021, which preceded significant rallies. “In both 2017 & 2021, a second #RSI explosion above 65 triggered massive moves,” he said. He further pointed out that the current Stock RSI cross-up could be an early indicator that the next RSI-driven move is underway. XRP’s consolidation around the $2 mark attracts increased attention as analysts highlight historical similarities, long-term chart breakouts, and key momentum signals. While some analysts, like Mags, anticipate a move toward $7.3 based on past cycle patterns, others, such as Martinez, see room for a climb to $15 if technical structures play out. With multiple indicators aligning, the asset appears poised for a potential continuation of its bullish trend in the coming months.

44597689,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=160119,1747201827,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,US Stock Market: Nasdaq Soars as Dow Jones Stumbles – Decoding Mixed Market Trends,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-stock-market-mixed-close/,"In a trading session that offered a tale of two markets, major US stock market indices closed with divergent results, leaving investors pondering the underlying dynamics. While tech-heavy growth stocks powered the Nasdaq and S&P 500 higher, traditional industrial giants lagged, pulling the Dow Jones into negative territory. For those tracking the often-correlated world of cryptocurrency, understanding these nuanced movements in the broader financial landscape is crucial. Decoding the Latest US Stock Market Performance The closing bell revealed a split decision from Wall Street: S&P 500: Gained 0.72% Nasdaq Composite: Rose a significant 1.58% Dow Jones Industrial Average: Dipped 0.64% This mixed outcome highlights a period where different sectors of the economy and different types of companies are experiencing varied fortunes. The strong performance of the Nasdaq , heavily weighted towards technology and growth stocks, signals continued investor confidence in this sector, often seen as a bellwether for risk appetite that can sometimes spill over into assets like cryptocurrency. Why the Divergence? Understanding Market Trends What factors contribute to such a divergence among the major indices? Several elements could be at play: Sector Rotation: Investors may be rotating capital between different sectors. Strength in technology (benefiting Nasdaq) might coincide with weakness in areas more dominant in the Dow, such as industrials or financials, perhaps due to shifting economic outlooks or specific corporate news. Interest Rate Expectations: Changing expectations about future interest rate hikes or cuts from the Federal Reserve significantly impact growth stocks (Nasdaq) more than value or industrial stocks (Dow). Hopes for stable or lower rates tend to boost tech valuations. Economic Data: Recent economic reports on inflation, employment, or consumer spending can influence different sectors differently. Strong wage growth, for example, might pressure companies reliant on labor (more common in the Dow) while boosting consumer tech demand (benefiting the Nasdaq). Company-Specific News: Earnings reports or significant news from large constituent companies (like Apple or Microsoft in the Nasdaq/S&P 500, or Boeing or Goldman Sachs in the Dow) can heavily sway their respective indices. Analyzing these factors helps paint a clearer picture of the underlying market trends driving investor sentiment across different parts of the economy. The S&P 500 : A Broader Market View As the benchmark for the broader U.S. equity market, the positive movement in the S&P 500 is particularly noteworthy. Representing the performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States, its gain of 0.72% suggests that while the Dow faced headwinds, a significant portion of the market experienced positive momentum. This index includes a mix of sectors, providing a more diversified snapshot than the Nasdaq’s tech focus or the Dow’s industrial bent. Its upward movement indicates that overall market sentiment, while not uniformly positive, leaned towards optimism, likely fueled by strength in key sectors like technology and communication services. The Tech Story: What Propelled the Nasdaq ? The Nasdaq ‘s impressive 1.58% jump underscores the continued dominance of the technology sector. This index is home to many of the world’s largest and fastest-growing tech companies. Factors contributing to its rise could include: Enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) advancements. Strong performance or positive outlooks from major tech players. Investor preference for growth stocks in anticipation of potential shifts in monetary policy. Given the strong correlation often observed between tech stock performance and the more speculative end of the cryptocurrency market, the Nasdaq’s strength is often watched closely by crypto investors as a potential indicator of broader risk-on sentiment. The Lagging Indicator? Analyzing the Dow Jones Conversely, the 0.64% decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average reflects challenges faced by some of the older, more established industrial and financial companies it comprises. The Dow is a price-weighted index of just 30 large companies, making it susceptible to significant moves in just one or two constituent stocks. Its performance can sometimes reflect concerns about traditional economic sectors, manufacturing, or global trade issues. The divergence between the Dow and the Nasdaq/S&P 500 suggests that while growth and tech remain strong, parts of the traditional economy may be facing pressures or less favorable outlooks from investors. Implications of These Market Trends for Investors What can investors, including those in the crypto space, take away from these mixed signals? Key Insights: Sector Performance Matters: Not all parts of the stock market are moving in lockstep. Understanding which sectors are leading or lagging is vital. Tech Sentiment Remains Strong: The Nasdaq’s rise reinforces the ongoing investor focus on technology and growth. Traditional Economy Faces Headwinds: The Dow’s dip suggests caution in sectors tied more directly to traditional industrial or financial activity. Correlation with Crypto: While not always perfect, the Nasdaq’s performance often provides clues about the risk appetite that also influences cryptocurrency markets. Continued strength in tech could be a positive sign for crypto sentiment. Actionable Insights: Diversification: The mixed market highlights the importance of a diversified portfolio across different asset classes, potentially including stocks and cryptocurrencies, understanding their differing drivers. Watch Economic Data: Pay attention to economic indicators and central bank commentary, as these heavily influence the sectors performing differently. Analyze Specific Sectors: Look beyond the headline index numbers to understand which specific industries or companies are driving the moves. Conclusion: Navigating the Nuance The recent trading session underscores the complex nature of today’s financial markets. The US stock market , as reflected in the mixed closures of the S&P 500 , Nasdaq , and Dow Jones , is not a monolith. Different forces are shaping the performance of various sectors, creating divergent market trends . For investors, particularly those with exposure to dynamic markets like cryptocurrency, staying informed about these nuances is key to making informed decisions. The continued strength in tech signals potential underlying optimism, while the softness in traditional sectors warrants careful observation. As market dynamics evolve, understanding these shifts provides valuable context for navigating both equity and crypto landscapes.

The firm is supported by Tether, Bitfinex, SoftBank, and Cantor Fitzgerald, and it plans to surpass Michael Saylor’s Strategy in Bitcoin per share. Meanwhile, Nasdaq-listed GDC announced plans to raise $300 million to build a crypto treasury, including Bitcoin and the TRUMP token. Despite growing institutional interest, Bitcoin’s price remains range-bound near $104,000. Twenty One Capital Races to Overtake Strategy Tether, the issuer behind the world’s most widely used stablecoin USDT, recently acquired $458.7 million worth of Bitcoin on behalf of Twenty One Capital, which is a Bitcoin investment firm it backs. The purchase was disclosed in a May 13 filing by Cantor Equity Partners with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),and it involved the acquisition of 4,812.2 BTC at an average price of $95,319 per coin. The Bitcoin was transferred into an escrow wallet on May 9. This move brings Twenty One’s total Bitcoin holdings to 36,312 BTC, placing it as the third largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. It trails only behind Strategy, with 568,840 BTC, and Bitcoin mining company MARA Holdings with 48,237 BTC, according to data from BitcoinTreasuries.net . Cantor Equity Partners holds 31,500 BTC on behalf of Twenty One and is also facilitating a SPAC merger that will list the firm under the ticker “XXI” once completed. Top Bitcoin holders (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.net ) Jack Mallers , the CEO of Twenty One and also the head of Strike, confirmed that the company is currently undergoing the merger approval process but did not specify a timeline for its completion. Tether is a majority stakeholder in Twenty One alongside crypto exchange Bitfinex, while Cantor Fitzgerald, a major Wall Street player, is sponsoring the SPAC deal and secured $585 million in funding to support the firm’s Bitcoin acquisition strategy. Additionally, Japanese investment giant SoftBank contributed $900 million to Twenty One, to help boost the firm’s ambitions. In filings that were made in April, Twenty One described its goal to outpace Michael Saylor’s Strategy as the top vehicle for investors seeking capital-efficient Bitcoin exposure. Unlike traditional companies that focus on earnings per share, Twenty One’s key performance metric will be “Bitcoin per share.” Twenty One vs Strategy (Source: SEC ) The company plans to reach 42,000 BTC by launch, with contributions including 23,950 BTC from Tether, 10,500 BTC from SoftBank, and around 7,000 BTC from Bitfinex, which will be converted to equity at $10 per share. After the Bitcoin purchase, Cantor Equity Partners’ share price rose by 5.2% in after-hours trading, although it retreated from its May 2 peak of $59.73 to around $29.84. GDC Joins Bitcoin Treasury Trend GD Culture Group (GDC), a Nasdaq-listed micro-cap company, also recently announced plans to raise up to $300 million to establish a cryptocurrency treasury reserve. The company, alongside its subsidiary AI Catalysis, revealed on May 12 that it entered a common stock purchase agreement with a British Virgin Islands-based entity to sell up to $300 million in common stock. The funds raised will be used to buy Bitcoin and the Official Trump (TRUMP) token as part of its strategy to integrate crypto assets into its treasury operations. GDC stated that this initiative is intended to align the company with the broader decentralization movement and is part of the firm’s ambitions to embrace blockchain-based financial infrastructure. Chairman and CEO Xiaojian Wang said that the move builds on GDC’s strengths in digital innovation and livestreaming e-commerce, while also positioning the company for a blockchain-driven future. GD Culture Group stock price over the past year (Source: Nasdaq ) The announcement was made despite the regulatory challenges facing GDC. The company recently received a Nasdaq noncompliance warning after it reported stockholders’ equity of only $2,643, which was far below the required $2.5 million. GDC was given until May 4 to submit a compliance plan. If accepted, the firm will have up to 180 days from the notification date to regain compliance with Nasdaq’s listing standards. GDC’s announcement also coincides with a major event connected to the TRUMP token, one of the crypto assets the firm plans to acquire. On May 22, the top 25 holders of TRUMP tokens are scheduled to attend a private dinner at the White House. The meme coin project already halted additional purchase considerations for the dinner, and attendees have been asked to undergo background checks. This event attracted a lot of criticism from some US lawmakers and regulatory experts. Senator Cynthia Lummis voiced concerns over the exclusivity of the dinner for top token holders, and also suggested that it raises ethical questions. Legal experts also warned that the Trump family’s increasing involvement in crypto could invite heightened scrutiny from the SEC. Tug of War Continues for Bitcoin Direction Despite all of the interest in Bitcoin from multiple businesses, BTC faced renewed selling pressure as US markets opened on May 13. This also happened despite encouraging inflation data that sent traditional stocks higher. BTC’s price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinMarketCap ) BTC/USD once again dipped below the $104,000 level, with the move defying expectations that lower-than-forecast inflation would boost risk assets. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Consumer Price Index rose just 2.3% year-over-year in April, which was the smallest increase since February of 2021. While the S&P 500 and Nasdaq both responded positively by gaining 0.7% and 1.4% respectively, Bitcoin’s price stayed stagnant. Market analysts pointed out that Bitcoin hovered near key liquidity zones, suggesting a temporary pause in directional momentum. Data from CoinGlass revealed that both upward and downward liquidity clusters were cleared, which prompted trader Daan Crypto Trades to comment that the market was now in a range-bound state with no massive liquidity levels in play. The day before, he predicted a drop to around $102,000, which played out as expected. Crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe added that Bitcoin stalling at current levels is not alarming and explained that a pullback to $97,500–$98,000 will still maintain the broader uptrend toward new all-time highs. Meanwhile, QCP Capital suggested that Bitcoin remains caught between its role as digital gold and as a risk-on asset, which created a lack of clear direction in the short term. They believe the evolving macro environment, shifting from protectionist policies to global trade optimism, could keep BTC trading sideways for now. Despite the immediate price weakness, some voices in the space are still very bullish. Binance CEO Richard Teng pointed to Bitcoin’s strong performance relative to traditional assets, and said that it outpaced gold, the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq since April 2. He also called Bitcoin’s momentum “undeniable.”",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING|USDT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-14 06:00:00

Dogecoin Has Retraced Some Of Its Latest Recovery Following a breach of the $0.25 level to start the week, the trend appears to have flipped for Dogecoin again as its price has registered a plunge during the past day. Below is a chart that shows the recent price action for the memecoin. As is visible in the graph, Dogecoin went to as low as the $0.217 mark in this crash, but the coin has since seen a bit of a rebound as it’s now back at $0.227. Though, despite this bounce, DOGE remains almost 10% in the red over the last 24 hours. The past day has also been red for most of the other cryptocurrencies, but DOGE has still stood out as one of the worst performers among the top tokens by market cap . That said, the memecoin is still among the best when past week’s timeframe is considered instead, as its price has gone up over 34% in this window. Speaking of the market cap, DOGE is currently the eighth-largest cryptocurrency in the sector, ahead of Cardano (ADA). DOGE & Other Coins Have Just Seen Notable Long Liquidations A consequence of the bearish price action across the cryptocurrency sector has been that liquidations have piled up over on the derivatives exchanges. “Liquidation” here refers to the process of forceful closure that any open contract has to go through after it has accumulated losses of a specific percentage. Considering that Dogecoin has been more volatile than most in the past day and the fact that the memecoin generally attracts high speculative interest, it would be expected that the asset would be up there in terms of liquidations. And indeed, data from CoinGlass would confirm it. As displayed in the above heatmap, Dogecoin has seen contracts worth $22.5 million liquidated in the last 24 hours, the fourth most in the entire sector. Out of these, more than $19 million of the positions involved were long ones, a natural consequence of the largely negative price action during this period. While DOGE’s liquidations are significant on their own, they pale in comparison to the numbers Bitcoin ($154 million) and Ethereum ($136 million) have posted, showcasing the gap in speculative activity between the altcoins and these two cryptocurrency giants. As a whole, the digital asset sector has seen liquidations surpassing $610 million, with around $489 million of the flush coming from the long investors alone.",Dogecoin|Doge|dogecoin|Dogecoin Crash|Dogecoin Liquidations|Dogecoin Longs|dogeusdt,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-05-14 06:00:14

According to a May 13 press release , eToro, alongside existing shareholders, will sell 11.92 million shares at $52 apiece. This is well above the originally marketed range of $46 to $50 and up from the 10 million shares initially planned. The offering gives the company a valuation of about $4.3 billion, or nearly $5 billion on a fully diluted basis. Funds managed by BlackRock indicated interest in buying up to $100 million worth of shares. This marks a significant comeback for the Israel-based firm, which paused IPO plans in April amid market uncertainty following tariff-related policy shifts by President Donald Trump. eToro also previously attempted to go public via a $10.4 billion Special Purpose Acquisition Company deal, which fell through in 2022. Founded in 2007, eToro offers stock and crypto trading, as well as copy trading features. It posted $192 million in net income for 2024, up from $15.3 million the year before, according to its IPO filing . Net contribution rose to $787 million from $557 million over the same period.

Sanctions-related restrictions currently prevent shares from being distributed to Russia-affiliated SBT Venture Fund I, which holds over 6% of Class A shares. eToro shares are expected to begin trading today, May 14, on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker ETOR. eToro’s IPO success shows growing confidence in capital markets, particularly for fintech firms balancing traditional and digital asset exposure.

The purchase was on behalf of Jack Mallers’ recently launched Bitcoin treasury company, Twenty One Capital. Twenty One Capital, announced in April , is being formed through a collaboration between Tether, Bitfinex, Cantor Fitzgerald, and SoftBank Group, with plans to launch via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) merger with Cantor Equity Partners. Once completed, the company will trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker XXI. XXI https://t.co/tByVe73j5R — Paolo Ardoino (@paoloardoino) May 13, 2025 Tether’s Treasury Firm Twenty One Capital plans to launch with a substantial treasury of more than 42,000 BTC worth approximately $4.4 billion. Tether and Bitfinex will be the majority owners, with SoftBank holding a minority stake. Under incoming CEO Jack Mallers, who also runs Bitcoin payments firm Strike, the venture aims to raise nearly $600 million through convertible notes and private-equity investments. It intends to offer Bitcoin lending services alongside other financial products. The big Bitcoin buy also comes shortly after Tether reported more than $1 billion in revenue in the first quarter. Tether is among several large companies that have been aggressively scooping up BTC this month. Michael Saylor’s Strategy hoovered up a whopping 13,390 Bitcoin for $1.34 billion while Japanese investment firm Metaplanet added a further 1,241 BTC to its treasury, which surpassed that of El Salvador on May 12. Corporate Buying Outpaces Retail Bitcoin investment firm River reported that businesses were outpacing exchange-traded products, governments, and even individual investors for overall Bitcoin accumulation growth this year. It noted that overall corporate holdings growth so far in 2025 totalled 157,000 BTC, worth more than $16 billion at current prices. Last month, Bitwise reported that at least twelve public companies bought Bitcoin for the first time in Q1 2025, and the amount of BTC held by publicly traded companies rose by 16% for the period. Over the weekend, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju said Strategy had turned Bitcoin into a deflationary asset as it was buying at a faster rate than total miner output, giving the asset a -2.3% annual deflation rate.

Synthetix said the acquisition is part of a broader strategy that includes recent acquisitions of Kwenta and TLX, reflecting ecosystem consolidation. “Reuniting under one banner simplifies our architecture and governance and unlocks the next phase,” Synthetix founder Kain Warwick said. “This is the kids going out to build their own successful startups, and coming back to join the family business.” “This re-acquisition marks the next chapter of vertical reintegration with direct protocol ownership of perps, options, and app chains: all of which already have SNX in their DNA,” Synthetix added on X. Source: Synthetix The announcement names Hyperliquid, Binance, dYdX, and Deribit, which will be acquired by Coinbase , as competitors, underlining Synthetix’s ambitions to rival major crypto derivatives platforms. SNX token mint and lockup To facilitate the acquisition, Ethereum-based Synthetix will issue up to 29.3 million of its self-titled Synthetix ( SNX ) token with a three-month lock-up followed by a nine-month linear vesting. SNX has gained 11.5% on the day to reach $0.94 at the time of writing. Related: Upbit and Bithumb suspend Synthetix token deposits, citing sUSD risks However, like most altcoins, it is massively down from its peak and is down almost 97% from its all-time high of $28.53 in February 2021, according to CoinGecko. Synthetix has also suffered recently as its native stablecoin, sUSD, depegged and fell to a low of $0.68 on April 18. The dollar-pegged asset remains below its peg at $0.93 at the time of writing.

44598336,https://timestabloid.com/?p=67152,1747203173,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Another Special Date Emerges For XRP Holders,https://timestabloid.com/another-special-date-emerges-for-xrp-holders/,"XRP holders are being advised to pay close attention to May 19, a date that could mark a significant milestone for the digital asset. CME Group, the world’s largest derivatives exchange, announced via a post on X that it is preparing to launch futures contracts tied to XRP, adding a new dimension of institutional exposure to the digital asset. The anticipation stems from recent developments on CME’s website, where a beta page referencing XRP futures briefly appeared before being taken down. CME later claimed the page was part of a test environment and does not indicate a finalized product. However, earlier statements and actions from the firm suggest otherwise. Mark your calendars and get ready to expand your crypto portfolio with XRP futures starting May 19. Trade your market view with confidence with CFTC-regulated XRP futures, available in larger- and micro-sized contracts. https://t.co/QKapp7sxi6 pic.twitter.com/Xnys8py1Du — CME Group (@CMEGroup) May 13, 2025 Official Confirmation Follows Industry Leak In April, CME formally acknowledged its intention to add XRP futures , shortly after launching similar products for Solana. This signaled a broader expansion of its digital asset offerings beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. The planned debut of XRP futures follows the March rollout of the first regulated U.S.-based XRP futures contracts by Bitnomial , another Chicago-based derivatives platform. Institutional Adoption Accelerates The timing of CME’s initiative aligns with growing institutional interest in XRP. In July of last year, CME introduced pricing indices for XRP. At the time, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said launching the benchmark reference rate was the first step toward institutional crypto products. This statement is now being viewed as a precursor to the futures product in the final approval stage. The significance of CME’s XRP futures launch goes beyond just the derivatives market. It is increasingly seen as a foundational step in a larger trend toward spot-based XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) . Industry observers have pointed to a potential domino effect, where future products pave the way for more direct investment vehicles. Presently, there are over a dozen ETF applications awaiting approval. These are from major financial institutions such as Bitwise and Franklin Templeton. Price Movement and Market Sentiment The cryptocurrency market is now watching closely to see how XRP will react in the days before and after May 19. As of the latest data from CoinMarketCap, XRP is trading at $2.56. While the 2018 launch of CME’s Bitcoin futures led to a sharp market correction, analysts are divided on whether XRP will experience similar volatility. It’s worth noting that 2025 market dynamics are significantly different from those in 2018. Regulatory clarity has improved , institutional interest in digital assets has expanded, and XRP has gained traction globally, particularly through cross-border payment use cases and court victories. For XRP holders, this development is more than just a new trading instrument. It could represent a key step toward mainstream integration within the U.S. financial system.

Once the deal is complete, the combined company will operate under the American Bitcoin name and trade with the ticker “ABTC.” “ Our vision for American Bitcoin is to create the most investable Bitcoin accumulation platform in the market,” said Eric Trump, Co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer of American Bitcoin. Gryphon is a U.S.-based company focused on entering both bitcoin mining and AI. If all goes as planned, the transaction could be finalized by Q3 2025, with American Bitcoin’s current shareholders expected to own around 98% of the combined company. The leadership team from American Bitcoin will continue to lead the business after the merger. Trump Family Expands Crypto Ambitions The latest move shows how Trump’s family is increasingly leaning towards crypto. After trying with projects like World Liberty Financial and memecoins like TRUMP and MELANIA, they have now turned to large-scale Bitcoin mining and building strategic Bitcoin reserves. Hut 8 Corp., which launched American Bitcoin earlier this year in partnership with Eric Trump, will also benefit from the merger. Their goal is to build the “world’s largest, most efficient pure-play Bitcoin miner”, while also building a strong Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. CEO of Hut 8, Asher Genoot, believes that the move will unlock capital for further growth, while keeping the company’s finances strong, and will also give investors a chance to profit from Bitcoin’s long-term potential. Earlier this year, Dominari Holdings announced a new project called American Data Centers to create computing systems for the AI industry. Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. are also investors in the project, and Eric is also on the advisory board of Dominari Holdings. Although Trump has promised to make the U.S. the crypto capital of the planet, criticisms are increasing as Trump is getting more involved in crypto, which could lead to conflicts of interest, regulatory challenges, and ethical concerns.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|MINING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-14 06:16:55

Without Know Your Customer (KYC) checks, eXch wasn’t your typical crypto exchange. It acted more like an instant swapper, allowing bad actors and cybercriminals to fly under the radar for years. Among its clients was the Lazarus Group. The North Korean state-backed hacking unit thrust eXch into the spotlight back in February, when it used the platform to funnel some of the $1.4 billion it stole from Bybit. When Bybit traced its stolen funds to eXch, it requested assistance — but the platform refused. This led to a fierce discussion over privacy versus security, but ultimately, eXch announced it would close its doors on April 17 ; on April 30, German authorities made it official . But according to security firm TRM Labs, the platform may have continued operating in stealth mode after the takedown. Here’s the rise, fall and afterlife of alleged crypto laundromat eXch. eXch shuts front door, keeps back door unlocked Alongside its shutdown announcement, eXch posted a message claiming it would not facilitate criminal proceeds. The post was removed within hours, and operations quietly resumed — signs of an internal disagreement or perhaps even a calculated attempt to lower visibility, according to TRM. CSAM-related fund flows traced to eXch. Source: TRM Labs German authorities seized eXch’s servers and confiscated 34 million euros ($38 million) in crypto , along with more than eight terabytes of data, effectively dismantling its public-facing infrastructure. Related: North Korean spy slips up, reveals ties in fake job interview “Just like we saw with Garantex rebranding as Grinex , eXch didn’t fully die after the shutdown. It quietly kept servicing a handful of partners via API, which meant laundering activity continued even after the public takedown,” said Jeremiah O’Connor, co-founder and chief technology officer of security firm Trugard. O’Connor added that it’s not unlikely for such platforms to serve loyal customers even after seizures. EXch website visited on May 13. Source: eXch “The people behind eXch.ch took full advantage of operating across multiple countries. The domain was registered through a UK-based provider, listed Switzerland as an admin location, hosted infrastructure in France, and had servers seized in Germany,” O’Connor said. It’s still unclear if eXch will kill its API or come back under a new name. TRM said in the May 2 blog post that the platform’s remaining back-end access continued to provide anonymization infrastructure for threat actors. No KYC, pooled liquidity draws illicit funds to eXch EXch’s origins trace back to 2014, according to “Fantasy,” lead investigator at crypto insurance firm Fairside Network. In an October 2024 investigation , Fantasy identified the platform’s first public appearance as a BitcoinTalk forum account promoting automatic swaps between Bitcoin ( BTC ), Perfect Money and BTC-e vouchers — payment methods commonly associated with high-risk transactions. Fantasy also traced the original Bitcoin wallet tied to eXch and found it was likely funded via BTC-e, the now-defunct crypto exchange shuttered by US authorities in 2017 for its role in laundering criminal proceeds. Fantasy’s forensic research found that the modernized form of eXch emerged in 2022, when its Ethereum hot wallet was first funded. Not long after, it became a hub for prominent crypto drainers. Monkey Drainer — the first known large-scale drainer-as-a-service operator — used eXch before its retirement . Other draining service providers like Pink Drainer and Inferno Drainer also passed funds through the platform, along with several major exploiters. EXch’s modern wallets traced to accounts held at Binance and OKX. Source: Fantasy/MetaSleuth EXch required no identity verification, allowing users to move funds with anonymity. That made it an attractive tool for cybercriminals looking to clean stolen assets. “EXch managed to stay active for years — despite facilitating obvious illicit activity — because there’s still a big gap between what regulators ‘can’ do and how fast technology is moving,” Amit Levin, former investigator at Binance, told Cointelegraph. “In today’s world, anyone can launch a smart contract or run a crypto service from anywhere, often without revealing who they are. And if there’s no registration, no KYC and no one to hold accountable, enforcement becomes close to impossible.” The platform also drew confidence from threat actors by using a pooled liquidity system that blended user deposits and withdrawals, making it difficult for investigators and law enforcement to trace the flow of funds. When eXch knew and did nothing EXch denied laundering funds for North Korean crypto hackers , and in its shutdown notice, it framed the project as an attempt by privacy enthusiasts to “restore balance” in the industry. It criticized Anti-Money Laundering enforcement and condemned companies offering address risk scoring APIs as “parasites” profiting off government fear. “Service providers in the crypto space are, for the most part, not decentralized; that is, they retain control over or access to customers’ assets, as demonstrated in the case of eXch,” Gal Arad Cohen, partner at S. Horowitz & Co, told Cointelegraph. “A financial intermediary operating in the crypto sector faces risks similar to those of traditional financial service providers and should, therefore, be held to equivalent standards and regulatory requirements,” she said. The closure of eXch is a “huge win” for crypto, according to Alex Katz, CEO of security firm Kerberus. However, Katz warned that bad actors can migrate to alternative projects, like THORChain, which received a shoutout in eXch’s unapologetic farewell manifesto. In the Bybit hack, decentralized swap protocol THORChain was used as the main bridge to swap around 500,000 Ether ( ETH ) to Bitcoin. EXch operators also used THORChain to allegedly obfuscate trails. Source: Tanuki42 EXch stated that its partners would retain access to its API for a limited time, but future operations would depend on the “new management team.” The old team recommended setting up new liquidity pools to maintain seamless functionality and said it would provide consultations. It signed off with a defiant message: “Privacy is not a crime.” German authorities reported that $1.9 billion in crypto flowed into eXch since its inception. Its operators are suspected of commercial money laundering and running a criminal trading platform.

The venture research firm said in its May 14 Crypto VC Trends report for Q1 that 405 deals were made in the quarter, down 39.5% from the 670 deals made in Q1 2024, but slightly up from the 372 made in Q4 last year. However, the total value of deals in Q1 more than doubled from a year ago, jumping to $6 billion compared to $2.6 billion in the first quarter of 2024 and doubling from $3 billion in Q4 2024. PitchBook's senior crypto research analyst Robert Le said that despite macroeconomic turmoil over the quarter, “capital continued to seek crypto’s core utility rails.” VCs poured nearly $2.55 billion across 16 deals into businesses like crypto asset managers , exchanges, and financial services at a rate that far surpassed any other segment. Crypto infrastructure and development firms saw the next largest venture funding, fetching nearly $955 million across 30 deals. Web3-focused companies saw the third-most deals and funding, at 23 and $231.2 million, respectively. Source: PitchBook. Looking ahead, PitchBook’s Le said Circle’s pending initial public offering (IPO) “represents the most important price-discovery event for crypto equity since Coinbase listed in 2021.” If Circle is valued above the rumored $4 billion to $5 billion range, it could show venture investors that business models similar to Circle’s are profitable and sustainable while also providing a clearer benchmark for future exits. “A strong roadshow could therefore crowd in new late-stage capital and reset valuation expectations upward across the payments and infrastructure stack.” Circle has raised $1.18 billion in VC funding to date, according to PitchBook, which estimates a 64% chance that it will go public in the future. “Dollar-denominated settlement remains crypto’s killer application” Le noted that the market value of stablecoins grew 12% over the first quarter, from $202.3 billion to $227.1 billion, even as other cryptocurrencies saw their values fall or stagnate. “In our view, this divergence underscores a growing consensus: Dollar-denominated settlement remains crypto’s killer application, insulated—at least partially— from broader risk-off moves.” Le said PitchBook expected that near-term venture investments could increase, “especially in payment, remittance, and treasury-management startups that directly monetize stablecoin velocity.” Related: Bitcoin builders defend venture capital's role in layer-2 growth Le added that the $1.4 billion Bybit exploit in February — the largest in crypto history — may accelerate institutional demand for real-time proof-of-reserve tooling, improved custody solutions and middleware that simplifies key management. “Startups addressing those vectors should find a more receptive funding environment despite the broader valuation reset,” he added.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. In 2025, tokenized real-world assets are quietly moving from concept to cornerstone, as regulated platforms begin to transform global finance from the inside out. Table of Contents Tokenization meets real-world scale Blending TradeFi legitimacy and digital innovation Purpose-built networks for asset tokenization Who’s building the future of tokenized real assets? Measuring success: Beyond pilot programs Until recently, legal barriers and fragmented technology made tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) seem unattainable. In 2025, a silent revolution is underway. Tokenized real estate projects, commodity pools, and on-chain money markets are no longer just concepts; they’re becoming part of mainstream finance. Consider treating a luxury Dubai home or a US Treasury fund with the same digital convenience as crypto trading, replete with strict compliance and continuous liquidity. It is time to move beyond pilot projects and investigate the platforms that are integrating tokenization into the fabric of global banking. Tokenization meets real-world scale The shift comes when traditional finance reaches its boundaries. Real estate has always been illiquid and opaque, private equity demands large capital investments, and commodity markets rely on middlemen. In response, new blockchain systems are incorporating RWA tokenization straight into traditional banking procedures. These initiatives go from idea to practical reality by including compliance in the design phase and forming collaborations with legacy institutions. You might also like: Tokenization won’t take off without a reality check | Opinion Blending TradeFi legitimacy and digital innovation At the forefront is a platform that blends decades of institutional experience with blockchain’s programmability. MultiBank, supported by a derivatives behemoth operating under VARA in Dubai and licensed in seventeen jurisdictions, tokenizes ultra-luxury homes, allowing for fractional ownership, daily yield payments, and safe custody, all inside a regulated marketplace. Instead of disrupting current channels, it improves them, allowing investors to smoothly transition between traditional financial services and on-chain assets. In addition, one established digital-securities provider has used its status as a registered broker-dealer, transfer agent, and alternative trading system (ATS) to put private equity funds on-chain. This provider has made institutional-grade fund vehicles more accessible to a wider range of investors by decreasing minimum investment limits from millions to tens of thousands. The platform’s compliance-first strategy enables tokenized funds for top asset managers, demonstrating how regulatory integration may provide a competitive advantage. Purpose-built networks for asset tokenization Not all platforms rely on the current financial infrastructure. One team has created a high-throughput proof-of-work blockchain with money-market instruments backed by US Treasuries. Its unique consensus methodology is intended to accommodate tens of thousands of transactions per second, enabling a decentralized money-market fund with typical returns. Another network chose a bespoke Layer-1 architecture focused entirely on real-world banking. It hosts tokenized commodities, such as gold, as well as ESG-linked assets, thanks to strategic backing from leading digital asset investors. Asset passports offer legal enforceability, while multi-party computation methods enable institutional custody. This solution demonstrates how customized blockchains may handle the stringent requirements of regulated markets while maintaining DeFi’s composability. You might also like: Trailblazer in tokenization: MENA emerges as a highly promising player in the space | Opinion Who’s building the future of tokenized real assets? The rising credibility of real-world asset (RWA) tokenization in 2025 is largely due to the groundwork laid by various infrastructure-focused companies operating in multiple countries and sectors. Securitize is a digital securities business established in the United States that operates as a licensed broker-dealer, transfer agent, and alternative trading system (ATS). The firm focuses on allowing private market funds to be launched and exchanged on-chain while adhering to securities legislation. Securitize’s partnerships with companies such as BlackRock and Hamilton Lane have enabled institutional-grade assets to reach new investor groups. MultiBank Group , through its regulated subsidiary MEX Digital, adds traditional financial expertise to blockchain technology. Its cooperation with MAG, a luxury real estate developer, and Mavryk Labs, a web3 tech business, is one of the greatest efforts to tokenize premium real estate using a regulatory-first strategy. Plume Network presents itself as a Layer 1 network created specifically for RWA tokenization. Unlike general-purpose blockchains, Plume incorporates RWA tools at the protocol layer to handle tokenized commodities, carbon credits, and other physical assets. Its testnet traction and institutional alliances indicate a rising interest in vertically integrated ecosystems. Quai Network’s Proof-of-Entropy-Minima (PoEM) concept provides new improvements at the consensus layer, allowing for high throughput without losing decentralization. Its collaboration with Frictionless Markets brings regulated financial products into the digital asset arena, such as US Treasury-backed tokens and energy swaps, pointing to future-ready money markets. T-RIZE Group , established in Canada, uses tokenization for large-scale building and infrastructure projects. Working via registered broker-dealers, the business uses blockchain to simplify previously illiquid industries such as residential construction, while also investigating ESG-linked securities like tokenized carbon credits. Measuring success: Beyond pilot programs The true evidence of RWA tokenization is not in announcements but in measures like secondary-market trading volumes, audit transparency, and cross-chain interoperability. As platforms show consistent transaction volume, regulatory filings, and institutional engagement, the industry’s narrative moves from speculative promise to operational durability. These projects are not just tokenizing assets but also building the infrastructure for tomorrow’s global markets by incorporating compliance into platform architecture and collaborating with major financial institutions. In 2025, the silent acceptance of institutional-grade RWA tokenization indicates that blockchain is poised to serve as the foundation of real-world finance.

This expanded access and simplified token purchases directly from the wallet, enhancing user adoption and activity across the ecosystem. Axelar Bridge Launch (May 8): Axelar integrated Sui via its Interchain Token Service (ITS), enabling native assets to be bridged to and from other major blockchains. This boosted Sui’s DeFi composability, allowing protocols to tap into external liquidity while remaining native to the Sui chain. Upcoming Sui Odyssey Event (May 17): The fifth edition of “The Great Sui Odyssey” will take place in Vietnam, spotlighting new developments in AI, DeFi, and gaming — all of which could act as forward-looking catalysts for continued growth. On-Chain Data Confirms Explosive Growth in SUI Ecosystem TVL grew from ~$1.8B in early April to $2.183B by May 14. The stablecoin market cap stands near $919M with inflows up 39.5%. If it crosses $1B, price could trend toward $4.50 under current dynamics. Monthly DEX volume peaked at $782M on April 23 — the highest single-day volume in Sui’s history — within a broader monthly surge. As of May 14, the 7-day total sits above $3.98B, up nearly 40% week-over-week and nearly triple April 10’s $253M figure. Futures open interest surged from ~$600M in early April to $1.86B by May 14 — a yearly high — showing strong leveraged demand across Binance, Bybit, and others. Sui has consistently maintained over 1.5 million daily active addresses through April and May, peaking at 1.7 million on April 29. On average, 1.2M–1.5M wallets interact daily, with a healthy mix of new and returning users. SUI/USD Approaches Key Resistance After 140% Rally SUI price has gained over 140% from its April 13 low of $1.73, reaching $4.20 on May 10 — the first time it reclaimed $4 since January 17, 2025. The rally gained momentum after breaking out of the $2.80–$3.10 consolidation zone on April 23. Notably, this breakout coincided with SUI’s DEX volume all-time high of $782M — confirming the strength behind the price surge. Price currently trades above all major EMAs, with the 20 EMA (~$3.58) providing near-term dynamic support. The $3.53–$3.85 region is acting as a structural base. SUI is consolidating between $3.85 and $4.15 — a former January supply zone — with visible buying support on pullbacks. A daily close above $4.35 would confirm breakout continuation and likely target the $5.30 ATH ( Dec 20, 2024). RSI is holding near 68.2 — slightly below overbought — suggesting slowing bullish momentum but no breakdown yet. Key support zones include $3.53 (20 EMA) and $3.10–$3.20 (aligned with 50 EMA and April breakout base). Can SUI Break $5.30 This Quarter? Metrics Remains Bullish SUI’s bullish structure is reinforced not just by technical strength, but by fundamental catalysts like Phantom wallet integration, Axelar cross-chain support, and institutional inflows. SUI’s structure remains bullish, supported by rising volume, strong on-chain data, and active user growth. A close above $4.35 could trigger a breakout in the next 2–3 weeks. If DEX volume returns to April highs, SUI may revisit its $5.30 ATH before the quarter ends. Support at $3.50–$3.85 continues to provide a solid accumulation zone",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|SUI,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-14 07:11:03
44600176,https://cointelegraph.com/news/alarm-bells-us-openai-world-privacy-concerns,1747206704,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png,Alarm bells ring in US over OpenAI’s crypto project World,https://cointelegraph.com/news/alarm-bells-us-openai-world-privacy-concerns?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"World Network, the digital identity and crypto project of Sam Altman’s OpenAI, has alarmed privacy activists ahead of its United States launch, with observers concerned over its data collection and protection practices. World “is the opposite of privacy. It’s a trap,” said Nick Almond, CEO of FactoryDAO, on X. While the project claims to protect user privacy in the age of proliferating AI, it’s faced a slew of regulatory concerns across the globe. Formerly known as “Worldcoin,” the iris-scanning technology and its crypto token payout scheme are being probed by authorities in India, South Korea, Italy, Colombia, Argentina, Portugal, Kenya and Indonesia. In Spain, Hong Kong and Brazil, it’s outright banned. World’s latest foray into the US could prove to be CEO Sam Altman’s biggest challenge yet, where privacy concerns are heightened by a patchwork of enforcement that differs state by state. Varying privacy laws could leave World users open to discrimination On April 30, Altman announced that World would set up in “key innovation hubs” in five states in the US: Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville and San Francisco. Would-be verified humans can scan their irises at these hubs, giving World unique biomedical markers. These markers, per World, can be used to prove one’s humanness when interacting with others on digital platforms. But as World expands into the US, an uncertain regulatory landscape could put people off and make it difficult for the platform to build user trust. Andrew Rossow, a cyber and public affairs attorney at Rossow Law, told Cointelegraph, “There is no comprehensive federal law specifically regulating biometric data (such as iris scans) in the US.” Indeed, laws differ state by state. Two states in which World will operate, Texas and California, have some form of legal protections on the books for biometric data. Users in the remaining three states, Georgia, Tennessee and Florida, must rely on federal law, which requires that “companies must be transparent and fair, but there are no special state rules for iris scans.” But even the existence of state law is no guarantee of protection. In Texas, there is no private right of action for biometric data — only the state attorney general (AG) can enforce the state’s Capture or Use of Biometric Identifier law. Altman announced World’s foray into the US market at a company event two weeks ago. Source: World “The effectiveness of user data protections, as it pertains to World, hinges almost entirely on the Texas AG’s priorities, resources and willingness to act,” said Rossow. A more aggressive AG could mean more robust protections, while “a less aggressive administration could deprioritize enforcement, which leaves consumers open and vulnerable to exploitation.” The potential for exploitation is one of the key factors driving activist efforts against systems like World. Privacy International, a privacy protection group that supported legal action in Kenya against World, states that in “the absence of strong legal frameworks and strict safeguards, biometric technologies pose grave threats to privacy and personal security, as their application can be broadened to facilitate discrimination, profiling and mass surveillance.” Related: Over 70 crypto firms join forces to tackle Big Tech’s AI monopoly As far back as 2021, Amnesty International had raised concerns over discrimination and biometric systems’ applications of dubious methodologies. Such systems, they said, can “make inferences and predictions about things such as people’s gender, emotions, or other personal attributes, suffer from serious, fundamental flaws in their scientific underpinnings.” “This means that the inferences they make about us are often invalid, in some cases even operationalizing eugenicist theories of phrenology and physiognomy.” Not everyone is convinced of privacy watchdogs’ concerns. Tomasz Stańczak, co-executive director at the Ethereum Foundation, said that he has spent “over 100 hours” analyzing World, which is building on the Ethereum network. He added that it “looked very promising and much more robust and privacy-focused than my initial intuition.” Paul Dylan-Ennis, an Ethereum researcher and academic, said that he believes World’s tech “is likely strong in privacy terms” but admitted that the aesthetic could be putting people off: “Just some intangible Black Mirror-ness to it all.” Worldcoin faces mounting bans worldwide OpenAI may be doubling down on an American strategy, but other jurisdictions around the world are increasingly investigating, limiting or outright banning the firm’s activities. In 2023, regulators in India, South Korea, Kenya, Germany and Brazil began investigating the firm’s data collection practices. Spain became the first country to ban World data collection outright in March 2024. Related: North Korean spy slips up, reveals ties in fake job interview The Spanish Data Protection Agency previously told Cointelegraph that its course of action was based on reports from Spanish citizens. It claimed that Orb operators provided “insufficient information, collected data from minors and even failed to allow withdrawal of consent.” Following the ban, World published a blog post stating that it operates “lawfully in all of the locations in which it is available.” World has recently made its iris-scanning orbs more compact and transportable. Source: World Global regulators disagreed. Hong Kong followed Spain in May 2024 and ordered World to cease operations as it was allegedly violating the city-state’s Personal Data Privacy Ordinance. Further accusations of improper data collection practices followed, and a number of countries like Germany and, more recently, Kenya, have ordered World to delete the data of thousands of users, while Colombia and Argentina have issued hefty fines. In January 2025, Brazil’s National Data Protection Authority banned World outright , citing concern over the irreversible nature of data collection and the potential for World to influence economically disadvantaged people with the promise of crypto for their data. Opportunities in Japan and the US Despite protestations in various countries, the ID system is making inroads. In Japan, World is now a part of dating online. Spencer Rascoff, CEO of Match Group, which includes dating app Tinder in its portfolio, announced on May 1 that Tinder would be trialing World’s ID system on Tinder in Japan, “giving users a privacy-first way to prove they’re real humans.” Tinder users in Japan can swipe right with World ID-verified users. Source: World The integration in Japan is yet to take off, but as Tinder is the most popular dating app in Japan, it provides a major use case for the World identity platform. In 2024 alone, it had some 1.38 million downloads. If World could score a Tinder partnership in the US, it would acquire 7.8 million monthly active members overnight. If it expanded to similar services like Bumble or Hinge — the next two most popular dating apps in the country — World will have captured 67% of the US online dating market, comprising the personal, unique identities of tens of millions of users. But privacy rights in the US are far from settled. In Texas, one of the states where World plans to operate, Google recently settled to the tune of $1.4 billion. The company paid the eye-watering sum to the state of Texas after settling two lawsuits alleging the firm of tracking user search and location data, as well as collecting facial recognition information. Elsewhere, in Illinois and New York, biometrics firms face court proceedings, while lawmakers take measures to curtail the collection of biometric data.

44600340,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=727425,1747206989,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/44600340.jpeg,Federal Reserve won’t cut interest rates in June or July as it sees no need to bail the economy,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/the-fed-wont-cut-interest-rates-in-july/,"The Federal Reserve is staying put this summer. No cuts in June, no cuts in July. We believe that’s the central bank’s position after watching the joint statement issued on Monday by the United States and China, were both countries claimed they want to ease off trade tensions. As soon as that was announced, major Wall Street banks and traders dropped their expectations for a quick rate cut. They’re now saying the first one might not even come until September, and even then, only if things actually get worse. You see, Trump has revived employment and Wall Street, so the economy isn’t in trouble, and inflation hasn’t cooled enough for anyone at the Fed to start handing out cheaper credit. Traders step back as yields jump and risk appetite grows Traders who were betting on three rate cuts this year have backed off. Now the market is pricing in just two cuts for 2025, with swap contracts showing the Fed might only drop rates by 55 basis points, instead of the 75 they expected just last Friday. That adjustment alone rattled the bond market. The two-year Treasury yield, which always reacts to moves from the Fed, jumped 12 basis points on Monday, pushing back above 4%. That spike came after investors realized the central bank isn’t going to act just because Wall Street wants it to. The drop in rate-cut bets also made US Treasuries less attractive. Stocks, on the other hand, went up. So the money started chasing risk again. Since last week’s Fed meeting, where they decided to do nothing, yields have gone up fast. The two-year yield climbed more than 40 basis points, from 3.55% to over 4%. The five-year yield also moved, going from 3.85% to 4.11%. That’s a clear message from the bond market: no more easy money, at least for now. Jerome Powell, the Fed Chair, told reporters that the central bank is watching how new trade policies affect inflation and growth before doing anything. He made it clear there’s nothing in the data that shows the economy is falling apart. Powell ignores Trump’s pressure, stays focused on inflation Even with the market cooling off, president Donald Trump wants action. Just yesterday, the president posted on Truth Social, calling for lower rates. But as usual, he is living in his own unique set of data. Trump said : “No Inflation, and Prices of Gasoline, Energy, Groceries, and practically everything else, are DOWN!!! THE FED must lower the RATE, like Europe and China have done. What is wrong with Too Late Powell? Not fair to America, which is ready to blossom? Just let it all happen, it will be a beautiful thing!” Admittedly, there was a drop in prices for some things, like food and energy, which have been sliding due to higher oil production and weaker global growth. April prices in those areas fell compared to March. But overall inflation, even though it’s way down from its peak, is still higher than the Fed’s 2% target. That’s why they’re not rushing. Jake Dollarhide, CEO of Longbow Asset Management, said, “There’s been a fear that tariffs are going to push inflation higher, and they may still, but today’s data at least gives investors a sense of relief that inflation is still moving in the right direction.” But Raymond James economists aren’t convinced it’s time to cut. They wrote that ongoing uncertainty around tariff policies and how they’ll affect inflation is enough to keep the Fed from making any moves. The risk is simple: cut too early, and inflation might come back even stronger. Fed officials believe lowering rates before inflation is under control is a dangerous move. It could lead to even more price increases, and that would drag down real economic growth. Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY, said their team had to change their own forecast. “With little clarity on the final status quo for trade policy and Fed policymakers unlikely to preempt any growth or inflation developments, we now only anticipate two Fed rate cuts (instead of three), and believe the first rate cut will come in September (instead of July),” he said .",OP-ED|Federal Reserve|USD,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-14 07:16:29

According to a May 13 post on the Bitfinex Alpha blog, the realized market cap of Bitcoin ( BTC ) has reached $889 billion after rising 2.1% in the past 30 days. The realized cap values each coin at the price at which it was last moved, unlike the regular market cap, which multiplies the current price by the total supply. This approach better captures ongoing buying interest and more accurately represents the actual capital that has entered the market. Spot exchange-traded funds activity reflects that inflow. Net inflows into Bitcoin ETFs have exceeded $920 million over the last two weeks, indicating strong institutional interest. Meanwhile, on-chain data shows taht the number of coins held at a loss has drastically decreased, and over 3 million BTC have returned to profit territory. These changes suggest that market sentiment has improved and that sell-side pressure has decreased.

Bitfinex analysts credit the rally to a cooling of international trade tensions and the Federal Reserve’s more dovish stance . While broader risk markets have responded favorably to this macro backdrop, Bitcoin has outperformed equities, further confirming its status as a high-conviction asset for many investors. On the policy front, the U.S. continues to struggle with digital asset legislation. A key crypto bill, the Genius Act, failed in the Senate by a narrow vote, reflecting continued division on how to regulate the space. States like New Hampshire, on the other hand, are making progress with new legislation that permits investment in digital assets like Bitcoin. All things considered, Bitcoin’s increasing realized cap and growing institutional presence suggest that this rally has deeper roots than many others and may still have room to grow.

With a favorable market and potential positive developments in its ongoing ETF speculation, XRP is primed for a breakout. However, an emerging altcoin is quickly stealing the spotlight. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is generating buzz with its impressive projections, with experts forecasting a staggering 12,400% surge by Q4 2025. The project is in phase 4 of its presale, has already attracted over 9800 investors and raised more than $8.1 million. The clock is ticking, and early movers may never see a window like this again, since Over 70% of the phase has already been sold out. As investors diversify their portfolios, many are starting to question whether Mutuum Finance might offer even greater returns than established tokens like XRP in the coming years. The Mutuum Finance team has recently unveiled a new dashboard with a leaderboard that ranks the top 50 holders, who will be rewarded with bonus tokens for staying in the top 50 positions. Ripple (XRP) Set for Strong Rally: Will It Hit New Heights in 2025? It is at this time that Ripple (XRP) is currently experiencing a wave of optimism as it chases after a new High Mark, with the experts predicting this coin might cross the $4.50 mark in the next three weeks. The anticipation of this potential rally occurs as the digital currency witnesses greater utilization within the financial circles and a positive sentiment in the market as Bitcoin climbs. XRP’s appeal is its ability in terms of being a bridge currency for cross border payments for which it stands out from its peer XLM making it an ideal choice to hold by institutional players. As the market starts to recover, Ripple’s plan for 2025 indicates that they will be continuing to grow which makes them one of the biggest players in the altcoin race. However, while XRP’s prospects look bright, new tokens such as Mutuum Finance are also making waves owing to their huge upside potential. Mutuum Finance Presale Takes Off Mutuum Finance has taken the DeFi market by storm because of its innovative crypto lending approach which has gained fast momentum. More than 9800 investors have participated in the project’s unique presale through which they have poured $8.1 million of capital. Phase 4 features a $0.025 token price with a brief entry period that ends when prices rise 20% to phase 5. Investors participating in the current presale phase can get an enormous 140% ROI when the token reaches official listing at $0.06. The decentralized finance sector keeps expanding while Mutuum Finance emerges as the leading pioneer which brings innovative lending strategies and solid market leadership. Shaking Up Crypto Lending through a Dual-Model Approach Mutuum Finance is redefining crypto lending by interweaving two dominant models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). The P2C model allows users to contribute stablecoins to liquidity pools managed by smart contracts, earning passive income with instant borrowing availability for platform players. Even interest rates are adjusted automatically by the smart contracts to maximize lenders’ returns and lower borrowing costs. The P2P model takes decentralization to the level of eliminating third parties, allowing borrowers and lenders to directly interact. This provides users with the option to negotiate individualized loan agreements, facilitating higher transparency and an intuitive borrowing experience.

Undoubtedly, those engaged with the protocol will be keenly interested in the token. Another critical factor influencing predictions for Jito’s price in 2025 is the progress of the Jito protocol itself. While there’s no specific roadmap to anticipate upcoming enhancements, unveiling a future roadmap or declaration of forthcoming developments could significantly boost interest in the token.

In a recent post on X , he shares his altcoin portfolio, trading strategy, and macro insights, offering valuable perspectives for investors. Altcoins are waking up $ETH broke $2,500. $SOL hit $180. $PEPE doubled in a month. But it’s not time to ape into low caps just yet. Here are the 6 altcoins I’m trading this week, and what this early stage of the bull market tells us about what’s coming next — VirtualBacon (@VirtualBacon0x) May 13, 2025 Altcoin Market Analysis Typically, an altcoin rally follows a simple pattern: Bitcoin triggers the market , followed by Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), and finally, large-cap cryptos shift focus to small caps and meme coins. According to VirtualBacon, the market is currently in the large-cap breakout phase of the latest altcoin season. Since April 1, the altcoin market has grown by at least 27.23%. Ethereum surged by 47.04%, and Solana by 46.73%. Smaller altcoins like PEPE, TAO, and SUPER saw significant growth, with each reporting a rise of at least 40%. Key Factors Driving the Altcoin Trend A critical factor in the current altcoin rally is the temporary halt of the US-China tariff war for 90 days, reducing market volatility and boosting liquidity. VirtualBacon highlights that the Global Liquidity Index recently posted its first higher high since 2021, a key indicator for an altcoin season. Not Full Altcoin Season Yet Despite the positive momentum, VirtualBacon cautions that the market has not fully entered an altcoin season. He points out that until the US Federal Reserve pauses Quantitative Tightening (QT), the current altcoin rally remains a relief rally, not a full-fledged altseason. Top Altcoins to Watch Ethereum & Solana Ethereum and Solana are recommended for their strong fundamentals, with Ethereum surging by 64.5% and Solana by 37.7% in the past 30 days. L1 Exposure VirtualBacon suggests ALGO and IOTA as alternatives to XRP, with ALGO praised for its low price , liquidity, and tokenomics, while IOTA is highlighted for its new Move-based L1 and mainnet. Solana Ecosystem JUP stands out as a dominant player in the Solana ecosystem , with BORG (Mobile DEX) and SAROS (DLMM platform) emerging as promising projects. Gaming Sector SUPER is recommended for its consistency and long-term potential, especially with upcoming staker rewards for the community. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Trump-Backed American Bitcoin Set to Go Public in 2025 , AI Sector TAO is compared to Bitcoin in the AI crypto space, with the token showing a 2x rise from its low, following its recent subnet launch and token upgrades.

ETF flows reveal contrasting investor behavior: Bitcoin ETFs saw $867 million inflows compared to $1.5 million for Ethereum, yet Ethereum's price performance outpaced Bitcoin's. BlackRock has been a consistent net buyer of Bitcoin ETFs for 20 consecutive trading days, while Ethereum ETFs have experienced net outflows, except for some institutional interest from Hong Kong. Notably, 76,800 ETH were transferred to Binance Beacon, and 324,000 ETH were withdrawn from exchanges with over 180,000 ETH moved into staking, indicating a shift toward long-term holding. In the last 24 hours, Ethereum ETFs recorded inflows of $13.37 million, contrasted by Bitcoin ETF outflows of $96.14 million. Additionally, Abraxis borrowed $240 million USDT to stake 211,000 ETH, and a whale transaction exchanged 200 wrapped BTC for 7,900 ETH. The recent Ethereum price rally has been supported by real spot demand and developments such as the Pectra upgrade, contributing to increased ETH trading volume surpassing Bitcoin's.

But analysts are unfazed by the pullback. Historically, such corrections are natural after rallies, and Pi still remains up 59% over the last month. While Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana continue to dominate conversations, Pi Network is carving out a niche with its mobile mining app and decentralized Pi browser, aiming to bring real-world utility and mass adoption closer to reality. However, Pi’s year-to-date performance tells a different story. After institutional investors initially pumped massive amounts into Pi Network, its price sharply declined. But since bottoming out at around $0.40, Pi has climbed back to nearly $1.20, breaking through major resistance levels and moving averages. Where Is Pi Network Headed Next? Technical analysts have identified a parallel channel pattern forming on Pi’s chart. If the token breaks out of this formation, the price could surge another 234%, potentially reaching $5.27 per token. That would equate to a market cap of roughly $39 billion — putting it in the same league as other established projects. As of May 14, 2025, at 13:00, a total of 5.17 billion Pi tokens — valued at approximately $6.19 billion — are currently locked. Over the next 30 days, around 265.44 million Pi (worth about $317.92 million) are scheduled to be unlocked, which accounts for 5.13% of the total locked supply. On average, about 8.85 million Pi tokens (equivalent to $10.6 million) will be unlocked daily. The highest single-day unlock is expected on May 16, with approximately 14.75 million Pi tokens — valued at $17.67 million — set to be released. This upcoming unlock activity could lead to increased price volatility in the Pi market, as a surge in token availability often influences market dynamics and investor sentiment.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-14 07:46:25

According to an announcement shared with Cointelegraph, Mastercard partners can now rely on Kima’s settlement infrastructure to enable their prepaid cards to be topped up with stablecoins, including USDC ( USDC ) and Tether’s USDt ( USDT ), from self-custody wallets across more than 10 blockchains. Kima CEO Eitan Katz said the integration shows that stablecoins can be practical for everyday use, removing friction and intermediaries from crypto-to-fiat conversions while expanding crypto usability. “Our goal at Kima is to eliminate barriers between digital assets and traditional finance,” Katz said. Related: Mastercard tokenized 30% of its transactions in 2024 Infrastructure designed for interoperability Katz described Kima’s settlement system as asset-agnostic and designed to simplify cross-ecosystem payments, supporting public blockchains, private ledgers and traditional banking rails: “Kima’s asset-agnostic settlement layer is designed to abstract the complexity of transferring value across disparate ecosystems, whether that’s public blockchains, private ledgers, or even traditional banking systems.” According to the announcement, Kima’s infrastructure is aligned with Mastercard’s aim to bring stablecoins into mainstream financial usage. Katz rejects the Bitcoin and crypto hardliner vision of digital assets being contraposed to fiat currency, claiming that “crypto and fiat must coexist seamlessly to reach their full potential.” Katz explained that Kima’s solution allows easy crosschain interoperability and eliminates reliance on intermediaries, custodians or complex smart contracts. This, in turn, reportedly enhances security and efficiency for all parties involved.

The firms on the list have signed up to work with the ECB to explore digital euro payment functionalities and use cases. “The breadth and creativity of the proposals highlights the digital euro’s potential as a catalyst for financial innovation in Europe,” ECB executive board member Piero Cipollone said at the time. Source: Kima Despite Kima’s institutional partnerships, Katz told Cointelegraph that “compliance shouldn’t mean giving up control of your funds or your data.” He said that know-your-client and Anti-Money Laundering checks are handled by third-party banks and virtual asset service providers at onboarding, and Kima never has access to the data. Katz added that “once a user is cleared, every transaction carries immutable metadata tags that our protocol-level engine checks against local rules.” This, he said, covers compliance “from the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation to Singapore’s regulatory guidelines — before settlement.” Katz said that “keys are kept entirely under the users’ control,” while cryptographic proofs still allow for compliance. “Institutions get a plug-and-play control layer and users enjoy true self-custody,” Katz added.

Although the Bitcoin price is rising with some margin, the Ethereum price has been outperforming in terms of daily gains. Currently, the token has recorded more than a 12% jump compared 4% to 5% jump of Bitcoin. WIth this, the ETH price has reached one of the important resistance zones, breaking which, the token could become one of the top gainers for the month. Besides, the institutional interest in Ethereum is on the rise. The recent data shows the institutions sold nearly 889 BTC but bought 5,410 ETH during the last trading day. Along with this, the ETH inflows into accumulation addresses have spiked to insane levels. This hints that the big players may be aware of more things, which has raised their interest despite the sideways trend of the ETH price. As mentioned above, the ETH price has been in a slump for quite a long time, which dropped the interest among the retail traders. As a result, they sold off their holdings, which have now been accumulated by the institutions. Moreover, after the recent Pectra upgrade, the burn rates have been on the rise, which is a huge bullish signal for the crypto. What’s next? How high will the ETH price go in May 2025? The weekly chart of ETH price suggests the token is approaching the edge of the prolonged consolidation and hence a breakout from the accumulated zone is expected to kick-start a strong bull run. Two main indicators are set to undergo a bullish crossover shortly, which may confirm the start of a strong upswing: the Ichimoku Cloud and DMI. On the other hand, the token is consolidating between the 50- and 200-day MAs, which are acting as strong support and resistance levels. As the price in the weekly chart has never faced a death cross, the well-positioned price range between these MAs suggests the possibility of a rebound. The Ethereum price is working hard to surpass the pivotal resistance at $2,800, which could transform into a strong base preventing any major correction. With this, the price is believed to rise and reach the trand reversal zone around $3000 that may further push the token beyond $3,500.",Price Analysis|Ethereum,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-14 07:47:23

The Q-Day Prize is a challenge to make the Bitcoin network quantum resistant. On April 16, 2025, quantum computing-focused company Project 11 announced the “ Q-Day Prize ,” a competition to break a “toy version” of Bitcoin’s cryptography with a quantum computer. Contestants must complete the Q-Day Prize challenge by April 5, 2026. Their reward? 1 Bitcoin ( BTC ). The “Q” in Q-Day refers to quantum computing , the potential threat to many existing cryptographic security measures. But can quantum computers break Bitcoin? Let’s find out. Quantum computing and the threat to Bitcoin Bitcoin utilizes the SHA-256 hashing algorithm , a National Security Agency (NSA)-developed encryption algorithm. SHA-256 prevents brute force attacks against the Bitcoin network, as decrypting it with current hardware can take decades. However, the emerging threat to SHA-256 is quantum computing , a method of computing that harnesses quantum physics and is much faster than traditional computing. At a fundamental level, quantum computing utilizes quantum bits (qubits), which can exist in multiple states. This contradicts binary (traditional) computing, which uses binary bits (1s and 0s). In 1994, mathematician Peter Shor presented an algorithm for quantum computers to solve complex algorithms in seconds, rather than the decades it can take for conventional hardware. At the time, no hardware could effectively run it, but recent advances like Google Willow are nearing that capability. Quantum computing, when paired with Shor’s algorithm, can disrupt Bitcoin cryptographic systems as we know them. Shor’s algorithm allows quantum computers to solve complex math super fast, potentially threatening Bitcoin’s safety. Did you know? If quantum tech gets strong enough, Bitcoin’s current security could become obsolete, so developers are racing to create “quantum-proof” shields using new math that even Shor’s algorithm can’t break. Quantum threat to Bitcoin: How real is the danger? Bitcoin is vulnerable to quantum computing, but how serious is the risk? When you create a crypto wallet , it generates two important things: a private key and a public key . The private key is a secret code, like a password, that you must keep safe. The public key is created from your private key, and your wallet address (like a bank account number) is made from the public key. You share your wallet address with others so they can send you cryptocurrency, just like you share your email address for someone to contact you. However, you never share your private key. It’s like the password to your email — only you need it to access and spend the money in your wallet. Your private key is like a master password that controls your crypto wallet. From this private key, your wallet can create many public keys, and each public key generates a wallet address. For example, if you use a hardware wallet , it has one private key but can create unlimited public keys (wallet addresses). This means you can have different addresses for each cryptocurrency supported by the wallet or even multiple addresses for the same cryptocurrency, all managed by a single private key. While generating a public key from a private key is straightforward, figuring out a private key from a public key is extremely hard — almost impossible — which keeps your wallet secure. Every time you send cryptocurrency, your private key creates a special code called a signature. This signature proves you own the funds and want to send them. The system that uses your private key, public key and signature to secure transactions is called the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). It is believed that quantum computing could reverse the process and generate private keys out of public ones. It is feared that this could cause many Bitcoin holders (especially whales and Satoshi-era wallets ) to lose their funds. Bitcoin address types and quantum risks When you send Bitcoin, you use a specific address type to direct the payment. Each address type has unique features, affecting security, privacy and vulnerability to quantum computing attacks like Shor’s algorithm. P2PK address types When you pay someone with Bitcoin, the transaction is typically considered a “pay-to-public-key” (P2PK). This was the most common payment method in 2009, according to a report from consulting firm Deloitte. Much of the original Bitcoin released at the network’s launch is held in wallets with the P2PK address type, primarily due to the fact that they’ve sent transactions since Bitcoin’s 2009 launch. These addresses are long (up to 130 characters), making them less user-friendly. Wallets with the P2PK address type are most susceptible to Shor’s algorithm, as it can brute force the private key from a P2PK wallet address . P2PKH address types There’s a second address type that’s more resistant to Shor’s algorithm: the pay-to-public-key-hash (P2PKH). P2PKH addresses are shorter and are generated from the hash (a unique, hexadecimal value) of a public key created using SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160 algorithms instead of displaying the full key itself. These addresses are shorter (33-34 characters), start with “1,” and are encoded in Base58 format. Such addresses are widely used and include a checksum to prevent typos , making them more reliable. P2PKH addresses are more resistant to Shor’s algorithm than P2PK because the public key is hashed. The public key is only revealed when you spend from the address (not when receiving). If a P2PKH address never sends Bitcoin, its public key stays hidden, offering better protection against quantum attacks. However, reusing a P2PKH address (sending from it multiple times) exposes the public key, increasing vulnerability. Also, when you spend from a P2PKH address, the public key becomes visible on the blockchain, making transactions trackable. Taproot addresses Taproot is the newest address type , introduced in November 2021 via the Taproot soft fork. It uses Schnorr signatures instead of the ECDSA signatures used by P2PK and P2PKH. These addresses start with “bc1p,” use Bech32m encoding, and are 62 characters long. They offer better privacy. Multisignature (multisig) transactions look like single-signature ones, hiding complex spending conditions. However, Taproot addresses expose the public key (or a tweaked version), making them vulnerable to Shor’s algorithm, similar to P2PK. Did you know? Google’s “Willow” computer chip is capable of solving a complex problem in just five minutes. The same task would take a classical supercomputer 10 septillion (!) years. The race toward quantum-proofing Bitcoin Quantum resistance is a real challenge, but not an impossible one. Quantum computers, still in early development, could one day use Shor’s algorithm to break Bitcoin’s cryptography by deriving private keys from public keys. This would threaten Bitcoin and other systems using SHA-256 or ECDSA (the algorithms securing Bitcoin transactions). However, this threat is not imminent, and solutions are already in progress. While some believe that Project 11 presented the Q-Day Prize to take down Bitcoin, the company claims this initiative is aimed at “quantum-proofing” the network. In July 2022, the US Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) announced four quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms resulting from a six-year challenge to develop such solutions. Quantum computing won’t develop in isolation, and centralized systems like government and financial networks could be bigger targets than Bitcoin’s decentralized blockchain. These systems use outdated cryptography, like RSA, vulnerable to Shor’s algorithm, and store sensitive data (e.g., banking records). Their single points of failure make breaches easier than attacking Bitcoin’s distributed nodes. The International Monetary Fund warns quantum computers could disrupt mobile banking, while Dr. Michele Mosca from the Institute for Quantum Computing highlights “harvest-now, decrypt-later” risks for centralized data (where attackers store encrypted data today to decrypt with future quantum computers). In 2024, the G7 Cyber Expert Group urged financial institutions to assess quantum risks, noting that centralized systems’ data could be exposed if intercepted now and decrypted later. Did you know? Many blockchain networks are exploring quantum-resistant algorithms, such as Quantum Resistant Ledger or Algorand. These quantum computing blockchain security methods present a few different approaches. How to increase your security against quantum threats While the quantum computing cryptocurrency risk is less of a threat than one might think, it’s still best to stay prepared. Still, if you’re worried about Bitcoin quantum vulnerability , there are a few precautions you can take to secure your crypto finances. Avoid reusing public addresses: Most crypto wallets allow you to generate a new public address for every transaction. This practice will make it much harder to track your spending habits. Move funds to a private wallet: If you’ve been using the same public wallet address for some time, consider moving your funds to a new wallet with no history. This will help keep your spending habits private. Use a different blockchain network: Legacy networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum are considered less quantum resistant than newer networks with more modern security algorithms. Consider alternative networks with quantum resistance in mind. Stay informed: Pay attention to the results of the Q-Day Prize challenge, and stay up to date with quantum computing news so you can react accordingly. The best defense is an informed one. While quantum risk is not immediate, developers and cybersecurity experts are actively working on solutions to ensure long-term security. In the meantime, users should stay updated about Bitcoin protocol updates and best practices, such as avoiding address reuse, as the network gradually moves toward quantum resistance.",Q-Day Prize challenge,EN,0,0,ALGO|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MINING|FORKS,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-14 07:50:00

According to data from crypto.news, Chainlink ( LINK ) was up roughly 6% trading at $17.27 on May 14 afternoon Asian time, extending its rally, which began May 6, as macro conditions eased. It is now up nearly 70% from its lowest level this year, giving the token a market valuation of nearly $11.39 billion. Open interest in LINK has also climbed sharply, reaching $768.65 million, its highest level since March 11, when it stood at $400 million, according to CoinGlass. Rising open interest typically signals increasing trader participation and heightened speculative activity, often seen ahead of major price moves. Data also shows that the altcoin’s weighted funding rate has remained positive for the past 7 days. A positive funding rate basically means that traders going long are paying a small fee to shorts. It’s a sign that more people are leaning bullish and willing to pay up to hold their long positions.

LINK price, 50-day EMA and ADX chart — May 14 | Source: crypto.news The token has also formed an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, a classic setup that often signals a trend reversal. The head sits around $10, with the two shoulders near the $16 mark. Adding to the momentum, the Average Directional Index has climbed to 20, indicating that a strong trend is starting to take shape. LINK price 4-hour chart — May14 | Source: crypto.news Zooming into the 4-hour chart, LINK has been trading inside an ascending broadening pattern. If it manages to break above the upper boundary of that channel, it could trigger another leg higher. Based on this setup, the next likely price target for LINK is around $20.95, which would be a 21% gain from current levels. If bullish momentum continues, LINK could push toward its year-to-date high of $27.3 in the coming weeks, further extending gains to 58%. Ecosystem growth supports bullish narrative Momentum on the technical front is also being matched by a series of fundamental catalysts across Chainlink’s ecosystem. New partnerships and protocol-level integrations are positioning Chainlink to capture greater utility, which could amplify demand for LINK in the weeks ahead. Chainlink was recently picked as an official service provider for BNB Chain’s Kickstart Program. That means new projects on BNB Chain can now tap into Chainlink’s tools for data, cross-chain support, and computing, along with direct support from Chainlink Labs and co-marketing exposure. Dolomite, a decentralized margin trading platform, also integrated Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), allowing secure, seamless transfers across Arbitrum, Ethereum, and Berachain. Earlier last week, Chainlink also expanded its footprint with 12 new integrations of the Chainlink standard across six key services, including deployments on eight different blockchains: Gravity Alpha, Monad, NEX Protocol, Polygon, Ronin, Rootstock, Superseed, Taiko, and Zora. Meanwhile, LINK could also benefit from regulatory tailwinds. The U.S. administration is reportedly exploring updates to crypto rules to better accommodate on-chain securities and other digital assets. If clearer regulations come into play, that could unlock a wave of tokenized real-world assets moving on-chain, something Chainlink is well-positioned to support. More demand for tokenization could mean more projects integrating its services, which would naturally boost LINK’s utility and possibly its price. Chainlink is also a made-in-USA cryptocurrency , which could strengthen its appeal as the Trump administration pushes for homegrown blockchain projects.

It asserts RippleNet’s structural dependence on XRP and underscores XRP’s dominance as the principal currency used on its ledger. These claims are supported by data and text drawn from peer-reviewed sources, including a study published by Atlantis Press and a detailed flow analysis of transactions conducted between October 1, 2019, and April 30, 2020. One key excerpt emphasized by SMQKE states: “As one might expect, XRP is by far the most used currency on the ledger in terms of payment volume.” “Ripplenet DEPENDS on XRP.” + “As one might expect, XRP IS BY FAR THE MOST USED CURRENCY ON THE LEDGER IN TERMS OF PAYMENT VOLUME.” Ripple needs XRP. Documented. https://t.co/CPaTNL4ihL pic.twitter.com/2r5bqMDPpO — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) May 12, 2025 According to the referenced research, 125 billion XRP were transacted on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) for seven months, averaging approximately 586 million XRP daily. This quantitative assessment confirms XRP’s overwhelming role as the medium of exchange on its native ledger, far surpassing other IOU tokens or currencies issued by entities on the same network. Transaction Flows Centered Around XRP The graphical representation included in the same study further supports this conclusion. It illustrates the value flow of XRP across major platforms such as Binance, Coinbase, Bitstamp, and Huobi Global, alongside an array of transactions involving other currencies like USD, EUR, CNY, and crypto-assets such as ETH and BTC. The central axis of this flow chart is XRP itself, acting as the predominant currency bridging transactions between senders and receivers. The data reveals that XRP dominates by volume and structural centrality within the transaction architecture. RippleNet’s Systemic Dependence on XRP The second point in SMQKE’s tweet focuses on RippleNet’s operational model. A section from a 2021 analysis published in Advances in Economics, Business and Management Research affirms that “RippleNet depends much on XRP,” noting that XRP usage is intrinsic to RippleNet’s cross-border, real-time payment system. The paper elaborates that as long as Ripple’s global payment infrastructure remains active, XRP will retain a functional role as its medium of value transfer. It also mentions Ripple’s ambition to elevate XRP’s use beyond RippleNet, including a potential role in central bank digital currency systems , referencing a white paper by Ripple expressing this intent. Ongoing Strategic Efforts to Expand XRP’s Utility Further language from the document states that “XRP could become a ‘neutral bridge’ between different currencies,” and that Ripple continues to develop use cases and network configurations that place XRP at the core of its ecosystem. The study distinguishes XRP from other decentralized digital assets by noting that XRP “is totally controlled by Ripple Labs,” underscoring the company’s influence over the asset’s issuance and utility within its broader financial products. In summary, SMQKE’s tweet draws on substantive documentary evidence to reinforce the claim that RippleNet is not merely compatible with XRP but in fact structured around it. The data extracted from transaction records and Ripple’s intentions support the argument that XRP’s role is not peripheral but foundational. From a technological and operational standpoint, XRP continues to serve as the primary vehicle for value movement on the XRPL, with Ripple actively steering its integration into broader institutional frameworks.

According to data from Coincodex , Kaspa (KAS) price is predicted to rally by 229.24% and reach $0.35147 by June 9, 2025. Coincodex’s current technical indicators show that the current sentiment is bullish for Kaspa (KAS). This is likely due to the recent surge in Kaspa (KAS) network activity and the encouraging sentiments from its community. Following the launch of the Crescendo update, the number of Kaspa’s (KAS) daily transactions suddenly jumped to almost 700,000 in a single day. The update seems to be giving the Kaspa (KAS) network a fresh boost, further fueling its positive price trends toward the ambitious $2 mark. Pi Network (PI) Eyes $2 As Market Sentiment Turns Bullish Pi Network (PI) is witnessing a surge in market interest and bullish sentiment, fueling speculation toward a $2 price target. A prominent crypto analyst, Dr. Altcoin, recently reported that a whale wallet address acquired 70 million Pi Network (PI) coins from OKX, bringing its total holdings to 155 million. The analyst believes the current accumulation is likely due to a centralized exchange, such as Binance, preparing to list Pi Network (PI). Following this report, he made another post predicting that Pi Network (PI) will hit $1 today. John Lang, a node runner of the Pi Network (PI), also predicts its price will touch $1-$1.50 next, driven by anticipated updates on May 14 and forthcoming dApp launches. The Crypto Market’s Latest Money Maker The crypto market is full of chatter, but occasionally, a new project emerges with significant breakout potential. This is precisely why the analyst has a positive outlook on FloppyPepe (FPPE), as it embodies the characteristics of a rare gem. FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) projected 30,000% rally is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Invest $1,000 today and potentially pocket $300,000. A $10,000 investment could yield $3,000,000. Add an 80% presale bonus, and the upside potential becomes even more staggering. The presale is ending soon, so don’t let this chance slip away.

In a post on May 13, Armstrong said the offer was a “call to service” for those who want global financial reforms through crypto. “ This is an open call for any DOGE staff. If you are looking for your next mission after serving your country, consider helping create a more efficient financial system for the world at Coinbase. We’ve set up an accelerated interview/hiring process in recognition of your proof-of-work, ” the Coinbase CEO wrote, also sharing a link for them to follow. Coinbase invites DOGE staffer who dropped out of campus The message quoted a video shared by a conservative supporter’s account that featured a young former Harvard student, Ethan Shaotran, who said he dropped out of the university to join the DOGE initiative. He claimed that his decision left him ostracized by peers and receiving threatening emails. “ I dropped out of Harvard and came here to serve my country. It’s been unfortunate to see lost friendships. Most of the campus hates me now. ” Shaotran continued, “ if there’s one group of people who really have a shot of success, it’s the people here. They’re up until 2 am., Monday through Sunday .” DOGE: Harvard student who dropped out to join the DOGE team admits he’s lost friends and is a pariah on campus now. pic.twitter.com/zvn9RX73Kh — @amuse (@amuse) May 2, 2025 Explaining his choice to leave Harvard, the student said the need for systemic reform for America was more imperative than education. “ I think the value of this and the impact here is so much more vast than anything you could learn in a classroom doing computer science, ” he concluded. One critic on Armstrong’s post asked if the invitation was based on merit. “ Is it merit when a team did a horrible job and instantly gets offered their next job? Or is it nepotism on a political basis? Focus on merit, big man, ” they argued. Another user added, “ The next schism isn’t a political divide, it is a competency divide. Those who value merit, hard work and innovation, and those that do not. ” Coinbase joins S&P 500, replacing Discover Financial The hiring invitation came against the backdrop of some “good news” for Coinbase. The crypto exchange became the newest member of the S&P 500 index, replacing Discover Financial. The inclusion is set to take effect before US markets open on May 19. Coinbase is now the first and only crypto company to be added to the S&P 500, a move Oppenheimer analysts called a “watershed moment” for the industry and increased their price target on Coinbase shares to $293. The financial firm recently reported its first-quarter earnings, which revealed that profits plummeted 94% to $66 million, compared to $1.176 billion in Q1 of the previous year. Yet, revenue rose 23.4% to $1.96 billion from $1.588 billion, Armstrong also shared his optimistic sentiment on social media, predicting that “crypto will be in everyone’s 401k.” “My goal is that in 5–10 years, getting into COIN50 index will feel as good as this,” the CEO reckoned . New asset launch for cbADA, cbDOGE, cbLTC, cbXRP Coinbase also issued an advisory regarding several new token assets, cbADA, cbDOGE, cbLTC, and cbXRP, which are not yet available for trading. The company warned users to be cautious of fraudulent actors claiming the assets are live. “These assets are not yet live or available,” the company stated . “We will announce their launch at a later date.” To prevent scams, Coinbase published the official Base contract addresses for each upcoming token and told the crypto community that any claims of their availability are false, potentially linked to fraudulent schemes.

Announced on May 14 , the plan aims to bolster Synthetix’s reach in the crypto derivatives sector by reintegrating a former ecosystem spin-off. The proposed acquisition values Derive—formerly known as Lyra—at roughly $27 million, with a swap ratio of 1 SNX to 27 DRV tokens. Community Vote to Decide $27M Derive Acquisition Next Week The deal, formalized under Synthetix Improvement Proposal 415 (SIP-415), is pending approval from both the Synthetix and Derive communities, with voting set to take place next week. If greenlit, the merger will combine Derive’s real-world asset (RWA) and front-end trading expertise with Synthetix’s core derivatives infrastructure. The move follows Synthetix’s recent acquisitions of Kwenta and TLX , signaling a strategic push toward vertical reintegration within its ecosystem. “Reuniting under one banner simplifies our architecture and governance and unlocks the next phase,” said Synthetix founder Kain Warwick. He likened the re-acquisition to successful startups “coming back to join the family business.” The proposal positions Synthetix to directly control a suite of derivative products, including perpetuals, options, and app-specific chains—each already linked to SNX, the project’s native token. As part of our full-force drive towards Synthetix v4 on Ethereum mainnet, a new proposal has just dropped: Synthetix to acquire @derivexyz Perps & options Exchange https://t.co/wC7jRyCJqR … Let’s break it down (1/6) — Synthetix (@synthetix_io) May 14, 2025 On social media platform X, Synthetix emphasized the consolidation move as critical to competing with top derivatives players such as Hyperliquid, Binance, dYdX, and Deribit, which was recently acquired by Coinbase. To fund the acquisition, Synthetix will mint up to 29.3 million SNX tokens. These will be distributed with a three-month lockup period, followed by a nine-month linear vesting schedule. At the time of writing, SNX was trading at $0.94, up 11.5% on the day. Still, the token remains significantly down from its February 2021 peak of $28.53—a 97% decline, per CoinGecko. Synthetix Pushes New Staking Plan to Restore sUSD Peg Last month, Synthetix founder Kain Warwick urged SNX stakers to participate in the newly launched sUSD 420 Pool, a staking mechanism introduced to restore the sUSD stablecoin’s dollar peg. The pool offers a share of 5 million SNX tokens to users who lock up their sUSD for 12 months, aiming to reduce the token’s circulating supply and stabilize its value. Despite the incentive, Warwick admitted the process is still “very manual” and lacks a proper user interface, which is currently in development. He warned that if voluntary participation remains low even after the UI launches, more aggressive measures could follow. sUSD, a crypto-collateralized stablecoin backed by SNX, has struggled to maintain its peg, recently falling as low as $0.68 before recovering to $0.77. Warwick emphasized that the solution lies within the SNX community, whose combined wealth could resolve the issue. The initiative is part of SIP-420, which also shifts debt risk from stakers to the protocol itself.

In a May 13 appearance on the Crypto in America podcast, McHenry revealed that during private meetings with Gensler, the former regulator expressed a far more nuanced view of digital assets. “Did he come across, or was he as anti-crypto in private as he did in public?” McHenry was asked. His response: “No… Nope.” McHenry noted that Gensler “saw the value of digital assets” and acknowledged the potential of blockchain technology during his time at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Gerald Gallagher, general counsel at Sei Labs, also noted that Gensler played a role in developing the concept of the airdrop during his academic work, calling it a largely forgotten chapter in his background. However, once Gensler became SEC chair, McHenry said, his stance shifted dramatically. “I had this weird, mistaken, stupid belief that he wouldn’t be that bad as SEC chair,” McHenry admitted. “And I mean, just the level of dismay.” Source: Crypto in America Related: SEC chair suggests ‘huge benefits’ in agency’s third crypto roundtable Gensler’s crypto stance was “confusing” McHenry said discussions with Gensler on crypto regulation were often confusing. McHenry explained that conversations with Gensler about legal frameworks and content structures often started off as reasonable, but quickly became contradictory. He described how Gensler would initially agree with certain points, only to later reject the same facts he had acknowledged moments earlier. According to McHenry, Gensler’s public opposition may have been shaped more by “Senate politics and confirmation politics than anything else.” After departing the SEC on Jan. 20, Gensler returned to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to teach fintech and AI. Under Gensler’s tenure, which started in 2021, the SEC took an aggressive regulatory stance toward crypto, bringing upward of 100 regulatory actions against industry companies. The regulatory hostility has also caused Gensler and his team much scrutiny and backlash from industry leaders. In December 2024, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong announced that the crypto exchange would sever ties with law firms employing former SEC officials involved in what he said was an effort to “unlawfully kill” the crypto industry. Source: Brian Armstrong In January 2025, Gemini also said it won’t be hiring any graduates from MIT unless the university drops former Gensler from his teaching role.

ETH climbed past $2,600 , while Dogecoin shot up to around $0.24, pushing the overall market mood into a positive zone despite some macroeconomic headwinds. Crypto Market Today The total crypto market cap jumped by 1.7%, with Bitcoin holding steady around $103,700. But while the green candles keep flashing, traders are trading carefully. A stronger U.S. dollar and renewed trade tensions have stirred some nerves, raising the risk of short-term profit-taking, especially with Bitcoin hovering near its highs. Analysts are split on where BTC heads next. FxPro’s Alex Kuptsikevich pointed out that the dollar’s strength is putting natural pressure on crypto markets . Meanwhile, QCP Capital highlighted that Bitcoin seems caught between two narratives, one as a safe haven and the other as a risk asset, which is creating indecision in the market. Crypto Fear and Greed Index Despite these uncertainties, the mood among investors remains upbeat. The Fear & Greed Index has held above 70 for four days straight, indicating sustained bullish sentiment. Glassnode analysts are now watching Bitcoin closely near the $105,000 mark to see if it will break higher or stall. Meanwhile, institutional flow hasn’t slowed down. Data from CoinShares shows that crypto investment products attracted $882 million in inflows last week. Bitcoin led with a dominant $867 million, while Ethereum attracted modest flows. Interestingly, Solana saw $3.4 million in outflows, even though traders have been actively buying call options targeting a $200 price by late June . All in all, while global market factors may weigh on short-term action, the altcoin energy and strong capital inflows are keeping the overall crypto mood fairly upbeat.

Standard Chartered will provide a comprehensive suite of banking services to FalconX’s global institutional clients following a strategic partnership, the companies announced on May 14. As part of the collaboration, FalconX will initially integrate Standard Chartered’s banking infrastructure and access to a range of diverse currency pairs for its institutional clients. The partnership ultimately aims to include a broader range of offerings and mutual opportunities, the announcement noted. Crypto support beyond banking The partnership is expected to “expand beyond banking” into additional products and services designed to meet the evolving crypto demand from both FalconX and Standard Chartered’s institutional clients. The joint services will target a broad range of clients, including asset managers, hedge funds, token issuers and payment platforms, the companies said. Matt Long, FalconX’s general manager of APAC and Middle East, referred to Standard Chartered as “one of the most forward-thinking global banks in digital asset adoption.” “At FalconX, we support trading and financing for some of the world’s largest institutions in digital asset markets, and this relationship strengthens our ability to deliver robust banking and FX solutions to clients who rely on us to operate in crypto markets,” he stated. SC is proud to provide banking services to crypto firms Standard Chartered’s collaboration with FalconX underscores the bank’s dedication to improving the digital asset ecosystem, Luke Boland, the bank’s South Asia head of fintech, said. “As institutional demand for digital assets continues to grow, we’re proud to provide the banking infrastructure that enables firms like FalconX to deliver world-class trading and financing solutions to institutional clients,” Boland stated in the announcement. Standard Chartered’s latest crypto move comes as yet another effort by the bank to provide banking services to the crypto industry. Related: Bunq, Europe’s second-largest neobank, expands into crypto In April, Standard Chartered partnered with major crypto exchange OKX to pilot cryptocurrency and tokenized fund collaterals to institutional investors. The bank’s involvement in the cryptocurrency industry dates back to 2016, when Standard Chartered made a strategic investment in Ripple, a company behind the XRP ( XRP ) cryptocurrency. The growing banking commitment to crypto comes in line with expectations by executives of major industry firms, including Messari and Sygnum Bank, who forecasted a global banking push into Bitcoin ( BTC ) in the second half of 2025 amid favorable regulatory developments.

In its Q1 2025 earnings report released May 13, Semler Scientific, a publicly traded medical device firm that holds BTC on its balance sheet, reported a 22.2% Bitcoin ( BTC ) yield year-to-date, driven by realized and unrealized gains on its Bitcoin treasury strategy. In terms of dollar gains, Semler saw a $41.6 million BTC gain in Q1, which increased to $52 million by May 12. The company reported purchasing 894 BTC during Q1 at a total cost of $90.7 million, bringing its total Bitcoin holdings to 3,192 BTC as of March 31, with a fair value of $263.5 million. However, this value reflected a cumulative decrease of $16.9 million in fair value. Subsequently, through May 12, Semler acquired an additional 616 BTC for $59.6 million, increasing its total holdings to 3,808 BTC, which now holds a fair value of $387.9 million and a total cost basis of $340 million. Beyond Bitcoin, the company posted $8.8 million in Q1 revenue, down 44% year-over-year. Operating expenses surged to $39.9 million, including a $29.8 million contingent liability tied to a potential DOJ settlement. The result was a net loss of $64.7 million, or $6.74 per share, compared to net income of $6.1 million a year ago.

Strategy , the largest corporate holder with 553,555 BTC, reported a 13.7% BTC yield as of April 28, translating to a $5.8 billion gain year-to-date. That puts it at 58% of its revised full-year BTC dollar gain target of $15 billion. Despite the strong crypto performance, fair value accounting rules drove a GAAP net loss of over $4.2 billion in Q1. Riot Platforms, which held 19,223 BTC as of March 31, reported a year-to-date BTC yield of 7.7%. Despite producing 1,530 BTC in the first quarter, Riot’s profitability was pressured by a sharp increase in average Bitcoin mining cost to $43,808 per BTC, driven by the April 2024 halving and increased global hash rate competition. MARA , the second largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, has not disclosed an explicit Bitcoin yield percentage for the first quarter of this year, but its substantial increase in holdings—from 17,320 BTC in Q1 2024 to 47,531 BTC in Q1 2025, a 174% year-over-year jump—suggests aggressive accumulation and operational scale-up.

This is the prime broker’s first partnership with a major traditional bank. The move demonstrates the growing demand from large investors looking to access digital assets through regulated financial infrastructure. According to a May 14 press release , FalconX will integrate Standard Chartered’s banking and foreign exchange services as part of the partnership. This will enable it to give its clients access to a wide range of currency pairs and facilitate faster, more reliable cross-border settlement. The initial rollout will start in Singapore, with plans to spread throughout Asia, the Middle East, and the U.S. Matt Long, general manager for APAC and the Middle East at FalconX, said the partnership is a major step in bridging traditional finance and digital assets. “At FalconX, we support trading and financing for some of the world’s largest institutions in digital asset markets, and this relationship strengthens our ability to deliver robust banking and FX solutions to clients who rely on us to operate in crypto markets.” – Matt Long, general manager for APAC and the Middle East at FalconX You might also like: FalconX and StoneX execute first block trade of CME’s SOL futures FalconX, headquartered in California, serves some of the world’s largest hedge funds, sovereign wealth funds, and asset managers.

It expects the digital asset market to reach $10 trillion in value by 2026. Both companies see the partnership as a foundation for future growth. In the future, it may extend into additional services tailored to institutional clients as digital assets continue to move into the financial mainstream.

In a statement to crypto.news, a Curve Finance spokesperson said the new domain Curve.finance is “available and safe to use,” while clarifying that user funds remained “secured and safe at all times” throughout the incident. The protocol confirmed that its smart contracts and internal systems were never compromised, and that all services remain fully operational. Curve said it made the switch due to extended downtime and what it described as limited support from the .fi domain registrar, Iwantmyname. “The .fi will be down for too long / no point of moving back,” the team wrote in an X post. It added that registrars handling “.finance domains” offer better responsiveness and reliability compared to those managing .fi domains. The platform reiterated that the breach was strictly limited to the DNS layer and did not involve any unauthorised access to internal infrastructure. “None of our password protections or 2FA systems were bypassed,” the Curve Finance spokesperson said.

However, they confirmed that updates will be shared as soon as more information becomes available. In a separate post-incident update shared on May 13, the team said it took immediate steps to contain the threat, isolate the affected systems, and begin a full investigation. Curve also engaged security partners and its domain registrar to work on restoring normal operations, though the delay in registrar response was a key factor in the decision to abandon the old domain. In a subsequent update, it said that the registrar had successfully frozen the Curve.fi domain, effectively disabling the malicious drainer. Responding to a community member, the project also confirmed plans to introduce a .eth domain, which leverages the Ethereum Name Service, a decentralized alternative to traditional DNS infrastructure. That will come next. Needs slightly more work, but will happen — Curve Finance (@CurveFinance) May 13, 2025 As previously reported by crypto.news, the DNS hijack was first flagged by the Curve team on May 12. The attackers had rerouted traffic from Curve.fi to a spoofed website that mimicked the protocol’s interface and hosted a wallet drainer. The malicious page was live for several hours before access was restricted, prompting warnings from on-chain security firm Blockaid and other industry participants. The price of CRV, the native token of Curve DAO, initially fell nearly 7% to an intraday low of $0.71 following the news, but has since rebounded to $0.76 at press time, marking a 6% gain over the past 24 hours.

Lawmakers in both parties are trying to quickly bring back the GENIUS Act, a stablecoin bill backed by the crypto industry giants, after it stalled last week following backlash over U.S. President Donald Trump ‘s growing crypto ventures. Republican Senator Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, the bill’s lead sponsor, said in an interview with Bloomberg that staff from both parties are still working on it. He said he hopes Democrats will agree to pass the bill before the Memorial Day recess. “The window is now. We will see if reasonableness will prevail,” said Hagerty. The bill had bipartisan support in the Senate Banking Committee. Democratic Senator Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland, a key Democratic supporter of the bill, confirmed that senators have continued to work on it, though no details were disclosed.

As crypto.news reported earlier, the procedural cloture vote failed 48-49, falling short of the 60 votes needed to begin formal debate. Lawmakers cited concerns over insufficient safeguards against illicit finance and foreign stablecoin issuers, while several Democrats pointed to President Donald Trump’s crypto affiliations — including his memecoin and fundraising dinners — as complicating the process.
