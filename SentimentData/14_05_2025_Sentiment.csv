South Korea’s Financial Post reported that the Democratic Party, the National Assembly’s biggest party, is currently “considering” issuing a manifesto promise to ditch existing fiat on/off banking rules. Crypto Exchange Deregulation Now Inevitable, Sources Claim The current banking rules require domestic fiat-trading crypto exchanges to partner with a bank that must provide platforms with customer banking services via dedicated crypto wallet -linked bank accounts. Upbit trading volumes over the past 12 months. (Source: CoinGecko) In late April, the ruling People Power Party (PPP) unveiled a host of crypto promises, including a pledge to do away with the rule . If the DP does indeed follow suit, this could mean the end of the era of exclusive banking deals. Instead, exchanges would be free to strike deals with multiple banks. And that could potentially spell trouble for K Bank, whose partnership with the market-leading exchange Upbit has led to exponential growth for both parties. However, the media outlet wrote that the banking sector is now set to “undergo surgery” as “voices urging deregulation grow louder ahead of the presidential election.” Frontrunner Mulls Manifesto Pledge The media outlet claimed that the campaign team of the DP candidate and presidential frontrunner Lee Jae-myung is “strongly considering” making a near-identical pledge. That would all result in K Bank “taking a direct hit,” the outlet continued. Critics have previously claimed that K Bank’s “dependence” on its Upbit-related business could derail its long-running bid to go public. K Bank has been Upbit’s exclusive banking partner since mid-2020. Trades on Upbit account for almost 68% of the current total of the domestic South Korean market.

Regulators are also hinting that they could be prepared to soften their hardline stance on the crypto sector. The same media outlet wrote that the Financial Services Commission (FSC) is now “looking into conditional deregulation measures.” The FSC Chairman Kim Byung-hwan told reporters at a recent press conference: “Since the existing banking rules were introduced to reduce the risk of money laundering, we will need to check to see if banks and exchanges have the systems in place that let them manage all related risks. We will conduct a comprehensive review. And after that, we will decide whether or not we need to improve the current system.” An unnamed financial industry executive told the media outlet: “Since there are so many voices calling for deregulation, we will have no choice but to go in that direction. But we need to gradually ease regulations, while ensuring we make up for any shortcomings.” The post South Korean Crypto Exchange Deregulation Plans Set to Rock Banking Sector appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|Crypto Exchange|South Korea,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-05-13 23:30:00

Insider trading cases, like with $MELANIA, expose the high-risk, high-reward nature of meme-driven markets. Meme coins, once dismissed as fleeting internet jokes, are now outperforming traditional tech-focused cryptocurrencies in 2025. According to crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa, meme coins like Pepe, Bonk, Dogwifhat (WIF), Fartcoin, and Floki are demonstrating greater resilience and investor interest compared to many ‘tech’ altcoins. Sherpa suggests that the enduring appeal of these culturally resonant tokens may give them a longevity that tech-centric coins lack. He said : “There are 10,000 coins and none of them can sustain attention forever. It’s actually why I suspect the bigger, Lindy memes will have better staying power than in the past.

A significant move from within the ranks of a global banking giant signals the continued, perhaps accelerating, shift of top-tier talent towards the crypto space. Andrew Peel, who previously led digital asset markets at Morgan Stanley, has made the leap to establish his own venture in Switzerland, specifically focusing on building bridges between the old and new financial worlds. This departure from Morgan Stanley crypto operations highlights a growing trend: experienced professionals from established financial institutions are increasingly seeing opportunities to innovate and build within the decentralized ecosystem. Andrew Peel’s Bold Leap: From Morgan Stanley Crypto to a Swiss Crypto Investment Firm Andrew Peel’s decision to leave his prominent role at Morgan Stanley is more than just a career change; it’s a statement about where he sees the future of finance heading. His new company, based in the crypto-friendly hub of Zug, Switzerland, is reportedly focused on key areas poised for significant growth: tokenized funds and trading tools designed to connect traditional finance infrastructure with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. This focus on a crypto investment firm structure suggests an intent to not just observe but actively participate in and shape the institutional adoption of digital assets. Peel’s background at a major institution like Morgan Stanley gives him unique insights into the needs, challenges, and opportunities for bringing large-scale capital and complex financial products into the digital asset space. His move underscores the increasing viability and attractiveness of the crypto sector as a place for seasoned finance professionals to build innovative businesses. Building the Essential TradFi DeFi Bridge One of the most exciting, and perhaps necessary, developments for widespread institutional adoption of digital assets is the creation of robust and secure connections between TradFi and DeFi. Peel’s new firm aims squarely at this challenge, focusing on tools that facilitate a seamless TradFi DeFi bridge . What does this bridge entail? Interoperability: Allowing assets and data to flow securely and efficiently between traditional financial systems (like banks, brokers, exchanges) and decentralized networks (like Ethereum, Solana, etc.). Compliance Layers: Integrating necessary regulatory and compliance frameworks (KYC/AML) into decentralized applications and processes to meet institutional requirements. Product Innovation: Creating new financial products, such as tokenized versions of traditional assets or regulated access points to DeFi yield strategies. Infrastructure Development: Building the underlying technology and protocols that support these interactions, ensuring security, scalability, and reliability. This bridging work is crucial because while DeFi offers innovation, efficiency, and transparency, TradFi provides scale, regulatory clarity (in its own domain), and established investor trust. A successful TradFi DeFi bridge can unlock immense liquidity and bring new levels of efficiency to global markets. The Promise and Potential of Tokenized Assets A core focus for Peel’s new venture is tokenized assets . This concept involves representing ownership or rights to real-world assets (like real estate, stocks, bonds, commodities, art, or even intellectual property) as digital tokens on a blockchain. Why is this significant? Increased Liquidity: Traditionally illiquid assets can be fractionalized and traded more easily on digital markets. Improved Efficiency: Transactions can be faster and cheaper by removing intermediaries and automating processes via smart contracts. Greater Accessibility: Fractional ownership allows smaller investors to access high-value assets previously out of reach. Enhanced Transparency: Ownership history and transactions are recorded on a public or permissioned ledger, increasing trust and auditability. Automated Management: Corporate actions, dividend distribution, or royalty payments can potentially be automated using smart contracts. Imagine owning a token representing a share in a piece of prime real estate, or trading tokens backed by a portfolio of corporate bonds. Tokenized assets have the potential to revolutionize capital markets, making them more democratic, efficient, and global. Peel’s focus suggests a belief that institutions will increasingly leverage this technology for asset management and trading. Zug, Switzerland: A Premier Hub for Institutional Crypto Firms The choice of Zug, Switzerland, as the base for Peel’s new company is no accident. Known globally as “Crypto Valley,” Zug has cultivated a reputation as a leading jurisdiction for blockchain and crypto companies. Its attractiveness stems from several factors: Progressive Regulation: Switzerland has taken a proactive and clear approach to regulating blockchain and digital assets, providing legal certainty for businesses operating in the space. Supportive Ecosystem: The region boasts a concentration of blockchain startups, service providers, academic institutions, and government support, fostering innovation and collaboration. Talent Pool: A growing number of skilled professionals with expertise in both finance and technology are based in or attracted to the area. Global Connectivity: Switzerland’s position in Europe and its reputation as a financial center make it an ideal location for a globally focused crypto investment firm . Establishing a firm in Zug positions it within a respected and well-regulated environment, which is crucial for attracting institutional clients and partners looking for compliance and stability in the volatile crypto market. The Accelerating Trend of Institutional Crypto Adoption Andrew Peel’s move is part of a larger, undeniable trend: the increasing involvement of large financial institutions in the crypto space. While initial institutional interest was cautious, focusing primarily on Bitcoin custody or futures, it has rapidly expanded. Today, we see institutions exploring: Direct investments in cryptocurrencies and digital asset funds. Offering crypto trading and brokerage services to clients. Developing blockchain infrastructure for internal processes. Exploring tokenization for various asset classes. Engaging with DeFi protocols for yield generation or lending (albeit often through regulated intermediaries). This growing institutional crypto adoption is driven by several factors, including client demand, the potential for new revenue streams, diversification benefits, and the recognition of blockchain technology’s long-term potential to reshape financial markets. The movement of senior executives like Peel from firms like Morgan Stanley to build native crypto businesses is a strong indicator of the industry’s maturation and future direction. What Does This Institutional Shift Mean for the Market? The influx of institutional players brings both opportunities and challenges. On the one hand, it can lead to increased liquidity, greater market efficiency, enhanced credibility for the asset class, and significant capital inflow. On the other hand, it may also bring increased regulatory scrutiny and potentially centralize aspects of a historically decentralized market. Challenges and Opportunities in Bridging TradFi and DeFi While the potential of a TradFi DeFi bridge is vast, significant hurdles remain. Regulatory clarity is still evolving across different jurisdictions, creating uncertainty. Interoperability between disparate blockchain networks and legacy TradFi systems is technically complex. Security risks associated with smart contracts and digital asset custody require sophisticated solutions. Despite these challenges, the opportunities for innovation in creating new financial products, improving market infrastructure, and expanding access to capital are immense. Firms like the one Peel is launching are at the forefront of tackling these issues. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Evolving Landscape For investors, builders, and participants in both TradFi and DeFi, Andrew Peel’s move and the broader trend of institutional crypto adoption offer key takeaways: Stay Informed: The convergence of TradFi and DeFi is a complex and fast-moving area. Understanding the technical, regulatory, and market developments is crucial. Evaluate New Products: Keep an eye on regulated offerings related to tokenized assets and institutional access to DeFi yield, but exercise due diligence. Understand the Infrastructure: Pay attention to the development of the TradFi DeFi bridge technology, as this infrastructure will underpin future market growth. Recognize Talent Flow: The migration of top TradFi talent into crypto is a bullish signal for the industry’s potential and increasing sophistication. Consider Regulatory Trends: Regulatory developments, particularly in jurisdictions like Switzerland, will significantly impact how institutions engage with digital assets. This period represents a critical phase in the evolution of global finance, where the strengths of traditional systems are being integrated with the innovation of decentralized technology. Conclusion: A New Era for Institutional Digital Assets Andrew Peel’s departure from Morgan Stanley to launch a crypto investment firm in Switzerland focused on tokenized assets and the TradFi DeFi bridge is a powerful symbol of the ongoing institutional embrace of digital assets. It signifies not just interest, but a commitment from experienced finance professionals to build the necessary infrastructure and products for a future where traditional and decentralized finance are seamlessly connected. As more talent flows from Wall Street to “Crypto Valley” and other digital asset hubs, the foundations for widespread institutional crypto adoption are being laid, promising a transformed financial landscape.

A significant event just unfolded on one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, Coinbase, sending ripples through the Crypto Market . We’re talking about a massive withdrawal of Bitcoin , the kind that often signals big moves from big players. What Does a Massive BTC Outflow From Coinbase Mean? According to insights shared by André Dragosch, head of research at Bitwise, on the social platform X, Coinbase Exchange recently witnessed its largest BTC Outflow of 2025. A staggering 9,739 BTC was withdrawn from the platform. But why is an outflow significant? Unlike inflows (deposits), outflows suggest that users are moving their Bitcoin off the exchange, typically into private wallets or cold storage. This action is often interpreted as a sign that the holders intend to keep their Bitcoin for the long term, rather than selling it in the immediate future. Think of an exchange like a marketplace. When goods are taken off the shelves and stored away, it usually means the owner isn’t planning to sell them right away. In the context of Bitcoin , a large outflow reduces the immediate selling pressure on the exchange. Is Growing Institutional Demand Behind This Move? The prevailing sentiment, echoed by Dragosch and many market analysts, is that this particular outflow is a strong indicator of accelerating Institutional Demand . Institutions, such as asset managers, hedge funds, and corporations, typically handle vast amounts of capital. When they acquire Bitcoin , they often prefer to take custody of it themselves or use dedicated institutional-grade custodians rather than leaving large sums on exchange hot wallets, which can be perceived as higher risk. Here are a few reasons why institutions might move large amounts of Bitcoin off exchanges: Security: Holding keys in cold storage or with a trusted custodian is generally considered more secure against exchange hacks or failures. Long-Term Strategy: Institutions buying for long-term investment or HODLing strategies have no immediate need to keep assets on an exchange for trading. Regulatory Compliance: Some institutional mandates or regulatory requirements might necessitate specific custody solutions. Fund Operations: Entities like spot Bitcoin ETFs require custodians to hold the underlying BTC that backs the fund shares. The sheer size of the 9,739 BTC withdrawal from Coinbase in 2025 suggests it wasn’t a single retail investor making the move. This scale points towards a large entity or multiple large entities accumulating Bitcoin and securing their holdings. How Does Increased Institutional Demand Impact the Crypto Market? The growing presence and Institutional Demand for Bitcoin have several potential impacts on the broader Crypto Market : Benefits: Increased Capital Inflow: Institutions bring significant capital, potentially driving up demand and price. Market Maturation: Institutional participation can lead to more sophisticated market infrastructure, regulation, and legitimacy. Reduced Volatility (Potentially): Long-term institutional holders are less likely to engage in frequent trading, potentially reducing short-term price swings compared to speculative retail trading. Validation: Institutional adoption serves as a strong validation of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class, attracting further interest. Challenges: Centralization Concerns: Large holdings by a few entities could raise concerns about market manipulation, although Bitcoin ‘s decentralized nature mitigates this significantly. Market Influence: Large institutional trades can still cause significant short-term price movements. Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased institutional involvement often brings greater regulatory attention, which can be a double-edged sword. This specific BTC Outflow from Coinbase is a tangible example of the trends analysts have been discussing – that institutional players are increasingly active in accumulating Bitcoin . Coinbase’s Role in Institutional Bitcoin Adoption Coinbase has positioned itself as a key gateway for institutions entering the crypto space. Its Coinbase Prime service offers tailored solutions for institutional clients, including trading, custody, and prime brokerage services. This makes Coinbase a natural venue for large institutional purchases and subsequent withdrawals for self-custody or transfer to institutional custodians. The fact that the largest BTC Outflow of 2025 occurred on Coinbase underscores its importance as a platform for institutional activity in the Crypto Market . Actionable Insights for Investors What does this surge in Institutional Demand and large BTC Outflow mean for the average investor? Confirmation of Trend: This event reinforces the narrative that Bitcoin is gaining traction as a legitimate asset class among sophisticated investors. Potential Price Impact: Sustained institutional buying pressure, coupled with reduced supply on exchanges due to outflows, could be bullish for Bitcoin ‘s price in the long term. Consider Long-Term View: Seeing institutions accumulate for the long haul might encourage retail investors to also consider a long-term investment strategy rather than short-term trading. Importance of Self-Custody: The institutional preference for moving BTC off-exchange highlights the importance of self-custody for larger holdings, a practice retail investors can also adopt using hardware wallets. While one large outflow event doesn’t guarantee future price movements, it provides concrete evidence of the increasing sophistication and scale of participation in the Bitcoin market. Event Amount Exchange Significance Largest BTC Outflow (2025 YTD) 9,739 BTC Coinbase Signals strong Institutional Demand In Conclusion: A Bullish Signal? The massive 9,739 Bitcoin outflow from Coinbase, the largest recorded in 2025 so far, is more than just a statistic; it’s a powerful signal. It points towards accelerating Institutional Demand for Bitcoin , with large players actively accumulating and securing their holdings off-exchange. This trend is a significant factor shaping the Crypto Market , potentially driving future growth and validating Bitcoin ‘s role as a store of value and a strategic asset. As institutions continue to enter the space, events like this BTC Outflow from major platforms like Coinbase will likely become more frequent, underscoring the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency investment.

In the latest State of Crypto report, the firm noted that Solana outperformed Coinbase and Ethereum in transaction volume in the first two months of 2025. According to the report , Solana processed $364.34 billion in transaction volume in January and February 2025, enough to put it ahead of Coinbase and Ethereum. Only Nasdaq, with $647.36 billion, was ahead of the network. Solana had $364.34 million in transaction volume for the first two months of 2025 (Source: 21 Shares) This has led to a comparison between the two, with experts saying Solana could become Nasdaq onchain. The report stated: “Solana is now the most-used network in the world, boasting over 100M monthly active users. At its peak in January and February 2025, Solana processed $364B in volume-more than half of Nasdaq’s exchange volume.” 21 Shares analysts added that this performance aligns with the network growth trajectory since emerging from the ashes of FTX collapse. Since then, the network has seen a surge in almost all metrics, with capital deployed soaring more than 2,000% to almost $7 billion, while its native token SOL peaked at $263 earlier this year. Interestingly, stablecoin activity on the network has also increased substantially, growing 600% in the last 12 months from $2.16 billion to over $12 billion. What is driving Solana’s growth Meanwhile, the report focused extensively on the factors driving Solana’s growth over the past two years, noting that its infrastructure, transaction speed, and low fees are among the reasons. In comparison with other networks, Solana’s average block time of 0.44 seconds is only bested by Sui, with 0.21 seconds among the major smart contract networks. The blockchain can also handle up to 65,000 transactions per second and has an average transaction fee of only $0.03 However, the reason for the network’s growth extends beyond its infrastructural capacity, given that emerging networks such as Sui can rival it in this area. Its success is also a testament to its user experience and focus on partnerships. The report stated that Solana’s strategic partnerships with enterprises are also crucial to its performance. These partnerships with PayPal, First Digital, Visa, Stripe, and Shopify mean millions of users rely on the network settlement capacities. It said: “Solana’s technical supremacy and enterprise partnerships cement its role as the backbone of next-gen payment systems and retail-focused blockchain adoption.” Additionally, the report noted that more developers are building on Solana, pointing to the 83% growth in its developer base last year. This marks the first time another network will beat Ethereum in new developer growth. With developers building on Solana, the network has seen an influx of new products in all categories, such as decentralized finance (DeFi), decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN), AI, and memecoins. The report particularly highlighted memecoins as a growth catalyst and ultimate stress test for the network. What is next for the SOL price? Meanwhile, 21 Shares analysts believe that SOL might be undervalued, with its fair value between $520 and $1,800, depending on the growth rate. This estimate is based on a discounted cash flow model. It said: “Though based on TradFi valuation principles, which may not fully translate to crypto, this approach underscores Solana’s intrinsic value through real revenue generation.” With these estimates, the firm believes that SOL value could grow significantly, especially as it attracts more activity and increases on-chain activity. However, Solana is not expected to flip Ethereum in the market cap anytime soon, even if its growth trajectory impacts Ethereum’s dominance. At the time of the report in late April, SOL was trading at $152.72, and its market cap was around 34% of Ethereum’s. Since then, both assets have seen substantial growth in value, with SOL now worth $182.51 while ETH has increased by 50% in the past seven days to $2,692.

44587610,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=160053,1747180241,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,BitGo Partnership Seals Upexi’s Bold Crypto Custody & Solana Strategy,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitgo-upexi-crypto-custody/,"In a significant move highlighting the increasing convergence of traditional business and the digital asset world, cryptocurrency custody firm BitGo has inked a strategic deal with e-commerce company Upexi . This partnership is set to provide essential crypto custody and over-the-counter (OTC) trading services, supporting Upexi’s recently announced focus on cryptocurrency asset management. What Does This Partnership Mean for Upexi and BitGo? The core of this collaboration centers on BitGo providing its institutional-grade digital asset services to Upexi . For Upexi , an e-commerce company known for acquiring and scaling Amazon and Shopify brands, this marks a clear strategic pivot into the cryptocurrency space. By leveraging BitGo’s robust infrastructure, Upexi aims to securely manage its growing digital asset portfolio. Key aspects of the partnership include: Secure Custody: BitGo will provide secure storage solutions for Upexi’s digital assets, mitigating risks associated with holding large amounts of cryptocurrency. OTC Trading Access: Upexi gains access to BitGo’s OTC trading services, allowing for large-volume trades to be executed efficiently and with minimal market impact, crucial for managing significant positions. Foundation for Growth: The partnership provides Upexi with the necessary institutional-grade tools to confidently expand its digital asset holdings and management strategies. For BitGo , this deal further solidifies its position as a leading provider of crypto custody and financial services for institutional and corporate clients venturing into the digital asset market. Why is Upexi Betting Big on Solana (SOL)? A notable element of Upexi’s new digital asset strategy is its significant focus on Solana (SOL) . The company recently disclosed a substantial increase in its Solana holdings, accumulating 595,000,000 SOL, valued at approximately $100 million at the time of the announcement. This positions Upexi as a major holder of the high-performance blockchain’s native token. Upexi’s decision to concentrate on Solana is reportedly tied to a Solana -based financial strategy. While specific details of this strategy are yet to be fully unveiled, it suggests Upexi may be exploring opportunities within the Solana ecosystem, such as DeFi applications, NFTs, or other potential use cases that align with its business model or investment goals. The choice of Solana indicates a belief in the network’s scalability, speed, and growing ecosystem. The Importance of Institutional Crypto Custody As more corporations and institutions explore integrating digital assets into their balance sheets or business operations, the need for secure and compliant crypto custody solutions becomes paramount. Holding millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency requires specialized security infrastructure, insurance, and regulatory compliance that differs significantly from traditional asset management. This is where firms like BitGo play a critical role. They provide the necessary technological and operational frameworks to protect digital assets from theft, loss, or unauthorized access. For a company like Upexi , transitioning from e-commerce to managing significant crypto holdings, partnering with a trusted custodian like BitGo is a fundamental step to ensure asset safety and build confidence for stakeholders. Navigating Large Trades with OTC Trading Executing large buy or sell orders directly on public cryptocurrency exchanges can lead to significant price slippage and market disruption. This is why OTC trading desks are essential for institutional players. OTC trading allows parties to trade directly with each other, typically facilitated by a broker or a firm like BitGo , outside of the open exchange order books. For Upexi , which plans to potentially increase its Solana holdings further, using BitGo’s OTC trading services enables them to acquire or divest large amounts of SOL discreetly and at negotiated prices, minimizing the impact on the broader market price of Solana . This is a standard practice for large investors and a key service offered by institutional crypto platforms. Looking Ahead: Upexi’s Digital Asset Future With the BitGo partnership in place, Upexi is well-equipped to pursue its ambition of expanding its digital asset portfolio. The company has stated its intention to manage its existing holdings and potentially acquire more Solana . This strategic shift by a non-crypto native company highlights a broader trend of diversification and exploration of value within the digital asset landscape. The success of Upexi’s Solana -based strategy and its digital asset management through BitGo will be closely watched. It could serve as an interesting case study for other e-commerce or traditional businesses considering a similar move into the crypto market. The partnership underscores the growing demand for institutional-grade infrastructure to support this evolution. Conclusion: A Strategic Alignment for Growth The partnership between BitGo and Upexi represents a strategic alignment that provides Upexi with the secure foundation needed to execute its ambitious Solana -focused digital asset strategy. By leveraging BitGo ‘s expertise in crypto custody and OTC trading , Upexi is positioning itself to navigate the complexities of the cryptocurrency market confidently. This collaboration not only benefits both companies but also signals the continued maturation and institutional adoption of the digital asset ecosystem, particularly highlighting the increasing interest in platforms like Solana among corporate entities.

Bitcoin Investors With 10 to 10,000 BTC Have Expanded Holdings Recently In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has talked about the latest trend in the supply held by Bitcoin’s key investors: those holding between between 10 and 10,000 BTC. Related Reading: Bitcoin Near ATH, But Still No Extreme Greed: Green Sign For Bull Run? At the current exchange rate, this range converts to $1 million at the lower end and $1 billion at the upper end. Thus, the only investors who would be able to qualify for it would be the ones with substantial holdings. Generally, the influence of any entity in the market goes up the more supply that they control, so the holders belonging to this range would hold an important place in the ecosystem. Collectively, these investors are popularly known as the sharks and whales. Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm, which shows the trend in the Supply Distribution for the sharks and whales, an indicator that tracks the combined supply held by members of these cohorts: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin sharks and whales have seen their Supply Distribution go up recently, which suggests these large investors have been expanding their holdings. More specifically, the investors falling in the 10 to 10,000 BTC range have added around 83,100 tokens to their wallets over the past month. This accumulation hasn’t come in a constant manner, however, as these investors in fact reduced their supply for a period earlier in the month. This selling from the cohorts followed BTC’s recovery beyond $97,000, so it’s likely that the motive behind it was profit-taking. From the chart, it’s also visible that this selloff resulted in a pullback for the cryptocurrency. During the latest renewal of bullish momentum, the sharks and whales have again resumed their Bitcoin accumulation and have notably surpassed their holdings from the earlier peak. So far, the groups have shown no signs of profit-taking, which can naturally be a bullish sign for the rally’s sustainability. Related Reading: XRP Target Could Be $15 If This Pattern Is In Play, Analyst Says In the same chart, Santiment has also attached the data for the Supply Distribution of the investors carrying less than 0.1 BTC. Interestingly, these investors have been selling while the sharks and whales have gone through accumulation. This could be an indication that the shrimps believe the top could be in soon. Given the accumulation from the large investors, though, the analytics firm notes, “it may be a matter of time until Bitcoin’s coveted $110K all-time high level is breached, particularly after the U.S. & China tariff pause.” BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $103,800, up 11% in the last seven days.

Trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 785,900 followers on the social media platform X that he’s extremely bullish on the crypto market as mainstream institutional players begin to embrace the asset class. According to Van de Poppe, conditions in the crypto market are reminiscent of the Dot-com era, when tech and web-based firms saw their valuation skyrocket as investors piled in and became overexuberant on the emerging sector. “All I know: This is the cycle where everything is going to go ballistic. Higher than ever. The Dot-com bubble type of cycle for crypto, where there’s a lot of liquidity flowing into this asset class and a lot of adoption. It’s basically the only asset class to be significantly outperforming everything.” The Dot-com bubble exploded in 2000, destroying $5 trillion in wealth and driving thousands of companies into bankruptcy. One altcoin on the trader’s radar for a potential repeat of the Dot-com bubble is payments altcoin XRP . Van de Poppe predicts that the coin will come close to its all-time high (ATH) of $3.40. “When things go absolutely vertical, that’s the moment where you want to zoom out and get higher time frame entry points. The same applied for XRP. Marked the level around $1.75 as an important one for entries and it’s up 50% since. I assume we’ll attack the ATHs soon.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, XRP is worth $2.52. The trader is also bullish on the Solana ( SOL ) rival Sei ( SEI ). Van de Poppe predicts that SEI will rally by as much as 169% from current levels. “Indeed, break and flip and the next target is $0.30. I think that SEI will be trending up significantly more. First stop is $0.30, after that a slight correction for people to jump into the asset and then we’ll continue towards the $0.50-0.70 range. ” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, SEI is worth $0.26.

44588308,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=160054,1747180838,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Pioneering: Gibraltar Launches World’s First Crypto Derivatives Clearing Framework,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/gibraltar-crypto-clearing-framework/,"Get ready for a significant leap forward in the world of digital assets! Gibraltar, a jurisdiction known for its forward-thinking approach to crypto regulation, has just announced a groundbreaking initiative. They are set to introduce the world’s first regulatory framework specifically designed for the clearing and settlement of crypto derivatives. This isn’t just another piece of regulation; it’s a move poised to bring a new level of stability and trust to a rapidly evolving market, particularly concerning Gibraltar crypto derivatives trading. Understanding the Need for a Crypto Clearing Framework Before diving into the specifics of Gibraltar’s announcement, let’s talk about why clearing is so crucial, especially in the context of volatile markets like cryptocurrency. In traditional finance, clearing houses sit between buyers and sellers of derivatives contracts (like futures and options). Their primary role is to guarantee the transaction, even if one party defaults. This process, known as central clearing, significantly reduces ‘counterparty risk’ – the risk that the other side of your trade won’t fulfill their obligations. In the burgeoning crypto derivatives market, counterparty risk has been a persistent concern. While many platforms offer derivatives trading, the lack of a standardized, regulated clearing mechanism leaves participants exposed. If a large trading firm or even an exchange itself faces financial distress, it can have cascading effects, potentially leaving other market participants with unrealized losses. Gibraltar’s proposed crypto clearing framework aims to address this head-on. By establishing clear rules and requirements for entities acting as clearing houses for virtual asset derivatives, they are essentially building a safety net. This framework is being developed through a collaboration between the Government of Gibraltar, the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission (GFSC), and Bullish, a crypto exchange with a focus on institutional-grade infrastructure. This partnership brings together regulatory expertise and practical market experience. How Will the Virtual Asset Clearing Framework Work? The core idea behind Gibraltar’s initiative is to adapt well-established principles from traditional financial market clearing to the unique characteristics of virtual assets. While the full details of the framework are yet to be unveiled, we can anticipate key elements based on standard clearing house operations and the information available: Central Counterparty Role: Recognized clearing houses will act as central counterparties (CCPs), becoming the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer. This mutualizes and manages risk. Risk Management: The framework will likely mandate robust risk management procedures for clearing houses, including margin requirements, default management protocols, and stress testing. Segregation of Assets: Rules will likely require the segregation of customer assets from the clearing house’s own funds, providing an extra layer of protection in case of insolvency. Transparency: The framework is expected to enhance market transparency by providing a clearer picture of outstanding positions and risk exposures to regulators and market participants. Eligibility Criteria: There will be stringent requirements for entities seeking recognition as virtual asset clearing houses under the framework. According to reports, the framework specifically targets the clearing and settlement of virtual asset derivative contracts. This means contracts like futures, options, and perpetual swaps whose value is derived from underlying cryptocurrencies or other virtual assets. By focusing on this segment, Gibraltar is addressing one of the riskiest, yet increasingly popular, areas of the crypto market. Benefits of Regulated Digital Asset Clearing Introducing a regulated framework for clearing virtual asset derivatives offers a multitude of benefits for the market and participants: Reduced Counterparty Risk: This is the most significant benefit. By having a regulated clearing house guarantee trades, participants are protected from the default of their individual trading partner. Increased Market Integrity: Central clearing brings standardization and oversight, making the market more robust and less susceptible to manipulation or systemic failure. Enhanced Transparency: Clearing houses provide a central point for monitoring exposures, which can give regulators and market participants better insights into market health and potential risks. Greater Investor Protection: With clear rules and risk management procedures, investors and traders have greater confidence that their trades will be honored. Potential for Institutional Adoption: Traditional financial institutions are often hesitant to engage in unregulated markets due to compliance and risk constraints. A regulated clearing framework can significantly lower this barrier, potentially unlocking substantial institutional capital for Gibraltar crypto derivatives and the wider virtual asset market. Improved Liquidity: As confidence and participation grow, the market becomes more liquid, leading to tighter spreads and better execution prices for traders. Attracting Business to Gibraltar: By being the first to offer such a framework, Gibraltar positions itself as a leader in regulated crypto finance, potentially attracting businesses and talent to the jurisdiction. This move is a clear signal that Gibraltar is serious about fostering a mature, responsible, and sustainable digital asset ecosystem. It builds upon their existing Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) regulatory framework, which has been in place since 2018. Potential Challenges and Considerations While the prospect of regulated digital asset clearing is exciting, implementing such a framework is not without its challenges: Complexity of Virtual Assets: Crypto markets operate 24/7, are highly volatile, and involve various types of assets and networks. Adapting traditional clearing systems, designed for markets with defined trading hours and established assets, requires significant technical and operational innovation. Cross-Border Issues: Crypto markets are global. How will Gibraltar’s framework interact with regulations (or lack thereof) in other jurisdictions? This could create complexities for international firms. Attracting Clearing Houses: Will there be sufficient interest from entities willing and able to meet the stringent requirements to become recognized clearing houses for virtual assets? Technology Integration: Clearing houses will need sophisticated technology to manage the unique aspects of crypto derivatives, including potentially handling settlement in various cryptocurrencies or stablecoins. Regulatory Arbitrage: While Gibraltar leads, the absence of similar frameworks elsewhere could potentially push some activity to less regulated venues, at least in the short term. These are challenges that the GFSC and its partners will need to carefully navigate as they finalize and implement the framework. The collaboration with Bullish suggests a practical approach, leveraging market participant insights to build a workable system. Gibraltar’s Strategic Move in Crypto Derivatives Regulation Gibraltar has consistently aimed to be a reputable hub for digital finance. Its existing DLT framework was one of the first of its kind globally, providing a clear regulatory path for businesses using blockchain technology. Launching the first crypto derivatives regulation specifically for clearing is a logical next step and reinforces this ambition. By focusing on clearing, Gibraltar is targeting a critical piece of financial infrastructure. This is not just about allowing trading; it’s about making trading safer and more reliable. This focus on infrastructure-level regulation is arguably more impactful than simply licensing trading platforms. This framework could serve as a blueprint for other jurisdictions considering how to regulate the complex world of crypto derivatives. As institutional interest in crypto grows, the demand for regulated, secure trading and clearing solutions will only increase. Gibraltar is positioning itself to meet that demand. What This Means for the Market For traders and investors, this framework could mean access to more reliable and less risky ways to trade crypto derivatives. While the initial impact might be on larger, institutionally focused platforms operating under the framework, the increased market maturity and reduced systemic risk could benefit the entire ecosystem in the long run. For crypto businesses, particularly those involved in derivatives, Gibraltar offers a potentially attractive jurisdiction to operate within a clear, regulated environment. This could encourage more sophisticated products and services to be developed and offered under robust oversight. For other regulators, Gibraltar’s approach provides a real-world example of how traditional financial regulation principles can be adapted to the unique challenges of virtual assets. It highlights the importance of focusing on core financial infrastructure like clearing to build a safer market. The development of this framework is a significant step towards bridging the gap between traditional finance and the digital asset space. It acknowledges the growing importance of crypto derivatives while putting essential safeguards in place. Conclusion: A New Era for Crypto Derivatives? Gibraltar’s announcement of the world’s first regulatory framework for clearing and settlement of crypto derivatives is a landmark moment. It signals a maturation of the digital asset market and a proactive approach from regulators to build essential financial infrastructure. By focusing on reducing counterparty risk and enhancing market integrity through regulated clearing houses, Gibraltar is setting a precedent that could influence how other jurisdictions approach crypto derivatives regulation .

The current Mantra (OM) price analysis shows a coin stuck in a holding pattern, trying to break above key levels. Meanwhile, the Ethereum (ETH) price update has caught investor attention, with ETH jumping 7% thanks to the Pectra upgrade. Both tokens have setups worth watching, though each comes with its level of risk. Meanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) is gaining traction due to its Buyer Battles and the current price $0.0262 in batch 28. Traders climb the leaderboard to score massive daily rewards, including unclaimed coins. BlockDAG’s thoughtful design and growing community give it a solid reputation as the best crypto platform. OM Price Stuck Near Resistance With Mixed Signals The latest Mantra (OM) price analysis reveals a coin in limbo. Trading at $0.3636, Mantra recently saw its volume spike nearly 69% in one day before sliding back, suggesting traders are paying attention. According to recent Mantra price analysis, the coin bounced off support but continues to stall under the $0.42 resistance zone. If OM can break through that barrier, analysts say a run to $0.45 or even $0.48 could follow. But there are caution signs too. The OM price still struggles with a high fully diluted valuation compared to its total value locked. Profit-taking and macro headwinds might cap any near-term rally. Until OM clears that $0.42 line, the upside comes with hesitation. ETH Price Update: Pectra Upgrade Sparks Investor Confidence The newest Ethereum (ETH) price update comes as the Pectra upgrade lands, bringing serious improvements to how users interact with the network. ETH is now trading at $1,958, up nearly 7% in 24 hours. This bump follows the merger of Prague and Electra into a new upgrade suite called Pectra, which includes easier wallet features and gas payments in multiple tokens. One key change, the validator cap moving from 32 ETH to 2,048, caters to larger holders like ETF issuers. As this Ethereum (ETH) price update notes, investor interest is growing, with over 3.5 million ETH accumulated in under two months. Short-term targets now hover around $2,200 and $4,000. BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles Turn Trading Into a Race BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles are making crypto buying feel like a high-stakes contest. Every day, 25 million BDAG coins hit the presale market. Buyers rush in, and anything left behind? It goes straight to the biggest spender of the day, no paperwork, no fine print, just pure reward. That’s helped push total presale funds past $241 million, with more than 20.1 billion BDAG coins already sold. Those who joined early? They’re sitting on a 2,520% ROI. And with the current batch price $0.0262 to the launch price $0.05, today’s buyers can lock in over 90% ROI. This competitive format is creating real winners. If just 20% of that day’s allocation goes unclaimed, the top buyer could walk away with nearly $131K worth of BDAG at the batch price of $0.0262, or as much as $250K if the coin launches at $0.05. Veteran buyers are circling back to protect their spots, while new players are jumping in to grab BDAG on the cheap. Social media buzzes every night as wallets battle it out before the midnight UTC deadline. For anyone looking for the best crypto platform that combines utility and excitement, BlockDAG is making its case in real time. What Should Traders Watch Now? Traders are eyeing two key markers this week: OM trying to clear $0.42, and ETH aiming for $2,200. The Mantra (OM) price analysis remains cautiously optimistic, while the Ethereum (ETH) price update shows solid growth potential thanks to Pectra. But the real energy is flowing toward BlockDAG. With Buyer Battles driving daily action, the current batch 28th price $0.0262, and a chance to claim unclaimed coins, BDAG offers a different momentum. With early buyers already up 2,520%, those on the sidelines might want to act before May 13 closes the window.

Investors felt safe keeping most of their wealth in U.S.-based assets for years because of the country’s strong economy, stable currency, and deep financial markets. Still, recent trade disputes, new tariffs, and concerns about the long-term strength of the dollar are crushing their confidence. UBS clients reduce U.S.-dollar exposure as volatility rises The co-head of wealth management for Asia at USB, Amy Lo, said that the company’s wealthy clients are pulling away from U.S.-dollar investments as they feel uneasy about putting too much of their money in assets tied to the U.S. dollar amid global economic uncertainty and the ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China . Amy Lo also noted that most of their clients are turning to gold because it isn’t tied to any single government or currency, while others are putting their cash in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are becoming more widely accepted as alternative assets that balance traditional portfolios. Pro-crypto lawyer and strong advocate for XRP holders, John Deaton, even commented in a post on X saying, “We have officially reached the point where it is far more riskier to have zero exposure to Crypto than it is to allocate a small percentage of your net worth to it.” Clients are also looking for opportunities that offer growth without relying on the U.S. economy alone, which makes them more focused on managing risks and not just chasing high returns. UBS and other wealth management firms stated that these investors are adopting structured asset allocation models that spread risk more evenly. Morgan Stanley, for example, recommends a 40-40-15 split whereby 40% of your assets are in fixed-income bonds, another 40% in equities or stocks, and 15% in alternative investments like private equity or hedge funds, with the remaining 5% held in cash or cash-like assets in case of market downturns. Investors regain confidence in China and shift allocations Many wealthy investors who avoided the Chinese market for the past few years because of poor performance, strict regulations, and ongoing tensions with the United States are now slowly shifting their money back into Chinese assets due to strong stock performance, a more positive trade environment , and innovations from Chinese companies. Hong Kong’s stock market, the Hang Send Index (HSI) , is one of the best-performing stock indexes in the world in 2025, and Amy Lo explains that clients are now asking her directly about investment opportunities in the country after years of avoiding anything to do with China. This shift shows how quickly investor sentiment can change when signs of progress and stability appear. The recent tariff truce between the U.S. and China helped cool down some trade war tensions that affected global markets. The United States lowered its tariffs on most Chinese imports from 145% to 30% for 90 days, while China cut down its duties from 125% to 10% and agreed to remove some of their countermeasures set in 2018, which gave investors hope that trade will continue to improve and make China a more attractive opportunity. A private wealth management expert at Morgan Stanley believes that the recent trade agreement between China and the U.S. has created new growth opportunities in both countries and that repositioning investor interest back to China is simultaneous with a recovery in U.S. growth stocks. Morgan Stanley expects its high-net-worth clients will earn 7% to 8% in total annual returns over the next seven to ten years, but Christina warns that achieving these returns is now more difficult because of volatile markets. For this reason, clients are now rethinking how much risk they are taking, how their portfolios are balanced, and what role each type of investment plays in helping them meet their financial goals.

This milestone marks a decentralized network overtaking one of China's largest technology companies in market value. Concurrently, Ethereum's market cap has also exceeded that of Coca-Cola. The surge in Ethereum's valuation has been accompanied by substantial buying activity from Abraxas Capital, a London-based asset management firm. Over the past six days, Abraxas Capital has acquired nearly $500 million worth of Ethereum, purchasing over 211,000 ETH. The firm reportedly borrowed $240 million in USDT from the decentralized lending platform Aave and transferred it to Binance, suggesting continued accumulation of Ethereum assets. This buying spree coincides with Ethereum's price rally past $2,600. There is speculation about the identity and motives of Abraxas Capital, with some noting previous transactions linking it to Alameda Research before the latter's collapse.

For those tracking technological advancements, particularly in areas like Generative AI , the impact is becoming increasingly visible across various sectors. This trend is now significantly influencing how we consume literature, with Audible, Amazon’s prominent audiobook service, making a major move to leverage AI. What is Audible Doing with AI Narration? Audible recently announced a strategic initiative to partner with publishers to convert print and e-books into audiobooks using AI narration . This approach is designed to rapidly expand Audible’s content library. In a competitive market against platforms like Apple and Spotify, a larger, diverse catalog is a key differentiator. By utilizing artificial intelligence, Audible can streamline the production process, making it faster and potentially more cost-effective for publishers to turn written works into audio experiences. This expansion leverages sophisticated AI capabilities developed by Amazon. Publishers collaborating with Audible have access to a variety of AI-generated voices. Currently, over 100 different AI voices are available, supporting English, French, Spanish, and Italian languages, with options for various accents and dialects. Audible has indicated plans to increase the selection of voices and languages over time, enhancing the versatility of its Audible AI platform. How Does Amazon AI Power This? The core technology enabling this initiative comes from Amazon’s extensive AI research and development. Amazon AI provides the underlying infrastructure and models required for high-quality text-to-speech conversion. This isn’t Audible’s first foray into using synthetic voices. In 2023, Amazon launched an invite-only beta program featuring a ‘virtual voice’ tool aimed at self-published authors in the U.S. This tool allowed independent creators to transform their e-books into audiobooks using synthetic speech technology, significantly lowering the barrier to entry for audiobook production. The adoption of this ‘virtual voice’ technology by self-published authors highlights its practical benefits. A search on Audible reveals tens of thousands of titles explicitly labeled as narrated by ‘Virtual Voice’. This demonstrates that the technology is popular, especially among authors who might lack the financial resources or time typically required for traditional audiobook narration, which involves hiring professional voice actors and studio time. AI audiobooks produced this way offer a scalable solution for content creators. Are There Concerns About AI Audiobooks? Despite the clear advantages in speed and scale, the widespread introduction of AI-generated narrations has sparked considerable discussion and debate within the publishing industry and among listeners. Critics frequently voice concerns regarding the potential impact of these AI recordings on the overall quality and artistic integrity of audiobooks. Professional narrators, in particular, have raised questions about the nuances, emotional depth, and performance aspects that human narrators bring to a text, which AI might struggle to replicate convincingly. It’s worth noting that Audible has also explored partnerships with human narrators in the context of AI. Last year, Audible reportedly invited a group of audiobook narrators to participate in training AI models on their voices, suggesting an interest in developing more sophisticated or personalized AI narration capabilities, potentially blurring the lines between fully synthetic and AI-assisted narration. What About AI Translation? Looking ahead, Audible is also planning to introduce Generative AI capabilities for translation later in the year. A beta version of AI translation services is expected to roll out, offering both text-to-text and speech-to-speech translation. Initially, this will support translations from English into Spanish, French, Italian, and German. This feature could open up vast libraries of content to new language markets without the need for manual translation and re-narration. Recognizing the critical need for accuracy in translation, especially for published works, Audible plans to offer publishers the option to engage professional linguists to review and refine these AI-generated translations. This hybrid approach aims to combine the speed and efficiency of AI with human expertise to ensure quality and fidelity to the original text. How Does Audible Compare to Competitors? The move towards AI narration is not unique to Audible. Spotify, which has emerged as the second-largest provider of audiobooks after Audible, has also recently invested efforts into expanding its audiobook catalog using AI tools. In February, Spotify announced a partnership with ElevenLabs, a prominent AI audio technology provider. This indicates that the use of artificial intelligence for content creation, specifically in the audiobook space, is becoming a key area of competition among major platforms. The competition between Audible and Spotify, fueled by advancements in Amazon AI and other AI technologies, is likely to accelerate the production and availability of audiobooks globally. While the debate over AI narration quality continues, the accessibility and speed offered by this technology are undeniable drivers of market expansion. Conclusion: The Future of AI Audiobooks Audible’s aggressive expansion of its AI audiobooks library marks a significant moment in the evolution of digital content. By leveraging Generative AI and Amazon AI , Audible is not only aiming to boost its catalog size but also potentially reshape the economics and accessibility of audiobook production for publishers and authors alike. While concerns about quality and the role of human narrators persist, the efficiency and scale offered by AI narration are poised to make audiobooks more widely available than ever before. As the technology improves and translation capabilities are added, we can expect AI to play an even larger role in how stories are told and heard across the globe.

44588469,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=160056,1747182033,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,AI Export Rules: Trump Administration Abruptly Halts Biden Policy,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-halts-ai-rules/,"In a move that has significant implications for the technology sector, particularly concerning advanced AI development and the global supply chain for critical components, the Trump administration AI team has officially reversed a key policy introduced by the previous administration. After a period of speculation, the U.S. Department of Commerce formally rescinded the Biden Administration’s Artificial Intelligence Diffusion Rule. This rule, part of the broader Biden AI policy , was poised to introduce new export limitations on U.S.-made AI chips to various countries and strengthen existing controls, marking a pivotal shift in how the U.S. managed its technological exports. Understanding the Previous Biden AI Policy The Artificial Intelligence Diffusion Rule, championed under the Biden AI policy and scheduled to take effect soon after its announcement in January, represented a structured approach to controlling the proliferation of advanced AI technology. It was designed to limit the ability of certain nations to access cutting-edge AI chips , which are essential for training sophisticated AI models. The core of the rule involved a tiered system categorizing countries based on perceived risk levels regarding technology diffusion: Tier 1 Countries: Nations considered close allies, such as Japan and South Korea, would have faced minimal to no new restrictions on receiving U.S. AI chips . Tier 2 Countries: This group included countries like Mexico and Portugal. For the first time, these regions would have encountered specific limits on the export of certain AI technologies and components. Tier 3 Countries: Countries deemed adversaries or high-risk, including China and Russia, would have seen existing controls tightened significantly, making it even harder for them to acquire advanced U.S. AI chips . This tiered approach aimed to balance national security concerns with international cooperation, but it also generated debate about its potential impact on global technology markets and research collaborations. Why the Trump Administration AI Team Reversed Course On Tuesday, the US Commerce Department , now operating under the directive of the Trump administration, announced that it had instructed its staff not to implement or enforce the Biden-era regulation. This decision effectively puts the brakes on the structured tiered system just days before its planned implementation. U.S. Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Security Jeffery Kessler provided insight into the rationale behind this abrupt change. He stated that the Trump administration AI strategy would pursue a different path, focusing on a “bold, inclusive strategy to American AI technology with trusted foreign countries around the world.” This contrasts with the blanket restrictions proposed under the previous Biden AI policy . Kessler explicitly rejected the Biden administration’s approach, labeling it “ill-conceived and counterproductive AI policies.” The administration appears to favor direct, country-by-country negotiations and targeted agreements rather than broad, predefined restrictions. This suggests a potential shift towards a more flexible, perhaps more politically driven, approach to managing technology exports and international AI collaboration. What’s Next for AI Chips and Export Controls? With the rescission of the Biden-era rule, the immediate future of U.S. AI export rules is somewhat uncertain, though the US Commerce Department has indicated its intentions. While the specific regulation is gone, the underlying concerns about technology transfer remain. The DOC plans to develop and issue a replacement rule in the future. In the interim, the US Commerce Department released guidance to the industry, emphasizing existing regulations and potential risks. Key points highlighted include: A reminder that using Huawei’s Ascend AI chips anywhere globally constitutes a violation of current U.S. export regulations. A warning about the significant potential consequences for U.S. companies if their AI chips are discovered being used to train AI models in China, underscoring the ongoing sensitivity around advanced AI development in that region. Recommendations for companies to enhance measures protecting their chip supply chains from diversion tactics, ensuring technology does not end up in unauthorized hands or locations. This guidance suggests that while the *method* of control is changing, the *goal* of preventing adversaries from accessing advanced U.S. AI chips remains a priority for the Trump administration AI strategy. The Implications of Changing AI Export Rules The sudden change in AI export rules has several potential implications: Industry Uncertainty: Companies involved in semiconductor manufacturing, AI hardware, and related software face uncertainty as they await the new framework. Planning global sales and partnerships becomes more complex without clear, long-term regulations. Geopolitical Dynamics: The shift from a tiered system to direct negotiations could alter diplomatic relations and technology partnerships. It might offer more flexibility but could also lead to inconsistent policies across different countries. Pace of Innovation: Some argue that blanket restrictions can slow down global AI development. A move towards more targeted controls, if implemented effectively, might potentially facilitate certain international collaborations, though national security remains a tight constraint. Competitive Landscape: The policy changes could impact the competitive positioning of U.S. companies versus international rivals in the AI chips market. The stated aim of the Trump administration AI approach is to be “inclusive” with trusted partners while keeping technology from adversaries. The success of this approach will depend heavily on the specifics of the forthcoming replacement rule and the effectiveness of direct negotiations. Conclusion: A New Era for AI Technology Policy The formal rescission of the Biden Administration’s Artificial Intelligence Diffusion Rule by the US Commerce Department marks a significant pivot in U.S. technology export policy. The structured, tiered approach of the Biden AI policy is being replaced by what the Trump administration AI team suggests will be a more flexible strategy centered on direct engagement and targeted controls. While the industry awaits the details of the new framework, the immediate guidance from the DOC underscores the continued focus on preventing sensitive AI chips and technology from reaching potential adversaries. This policy shift highlights the ongoing tension between fostering international technological advancement and safeguarding national security interests in the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence, particularly concerning critical components like AI chips .

Tether snapped up 4,812.2 Bitcoin ( BTC ) at $95,319 each and transferred it to an escrow wallet on May 9, Cantor Equity Partners disclosed in a May 13 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. It brings Twenty One’s total Bitcoin holdings to 36,312 BTC, as Cantor Equity Partners holds 31,500 BTC on behalf of the firm, which will trade under the ticker XXI once the SPAC merger is complete. Twenty One’s CEO, Jack Mallers, said on May 13 that they’re already in the approval process of the merger, but didn’t give an exact estimate on when the transaction would be complete. Twenty One is already the third largest corporate Bitcoin holder, trailing only Strategy and Bitcoin mining firm MARA Holdings at 568,840 Bitcoin and 48,237 Bitcoin, respectively, BitcoinTreasuries.net data shows. Tether is a majority stakeholder in Twenty One alongside crypto exchange Bitfinex. The Wall Street heavyweight Cantor Fitzgerald is sponsoring the merger, providing financial advisory services and securing $585 million in funding to support Twenty One’s Bitcoin investments. Japanese investment holding firm SoftBank also invested $900 million into Twenty One, which is led by Strike CEO Jack Mallers. Strategy may have a legitimate competitor Twenty One said in an April presentation to the SEC that is looking to supplant Michael Saylor’s Strategy , formerly MicroStrategy, to become the “superior vehicle” for investors seeking “capital-efficient Bitcoin exposure.” The company is among many Bitcoin buying firms , but promises to be a “pure play” for investors seeking Bitcoin exposure with Bitcoin-native operations and more flexibility for strategic capital raises.

Earlier filings showed that 23,950 Bitcoin is expected to come from Tether, 10,500 Bitcoin from Softbank and about 7,000 Bitcoin from Bitfinex, which will be converted into equity at $10 per share. Cantor Equity Partners’ (CEP) share price soared from $10.65 to $59.73 on May 2 but has since fallen back to $29.84, Google Finance data shows.

While the technology, which uses the quantum states of subatomic particles to perform calculations instead of transistors and binary code, is still in its infancy, companies including Google and Microsoft are pressing forward with research and development. The goal is a massive step-up in speed that makes tough calculations like cracking encryption, such as that used to protect blockchains, faster and simpler. And when quantum computing becomes available, any attacker is unlikely to announce their presence immediately. “The threat won’t start with Satoshi’s keys getting stolen,"" Dillion said in an interview. “The real quantum attack will look subtle, quiet, and gradual, like whales casually moving funds. By the time everyone realizes what’s happening, it’ll be too late."" Dillion's doomsday scenario involves a quantum-computing-powered double-spend attack. In theory, quantum computing could reduce the mining power required for a traditional 51% attack down to about 26%, Dillion said. ""So now you've compromised the 10,000 largest wallets. You rewind the chain, liquidate those 10,000 largest wallets, then double spend all the transactions, and now you've really got a nuclear bomb,” is how he imagines it. The industry, of course, is working to find a solution. Bitcoin developer Agustin Cruz, for instance, proposed QRAMP , a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) that mandates a hard-fork migration to quantum-secure addresses. Quantum startup BTQ has proposed replacing the proof-of-work consensus system that underpins the original blockchain entirely with quantum-native consensus. The problem is that the proposals must gain community approval. Blockchain governance, such as Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) and their Ethereum equivalents, Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), tends to be rife with politics, making it a long, inherently cautious process. For example, the Bitcoin community's recent resolution on the OP_RETURN function was years in the making, with months of developer debates about what's considered the ""proper"" use of the blockchain. Ethereum's upgrades, like the Merge, also faced lengthy debates and delays . Dillion argues that the governance process leaves crypto dangerously exposed because quantum computing threats will evolve much faster than the protocols can respond. “Everyone's trying to do this from the top down by starting with a BIP or an EIP and getting everyone's buy-in together. But we think that this is a very difficult, heavy lift,” he said. Quip Network’s quantum-proof vaults aim to circumvent the political inertia by allowing immediate user-level adoption without requiring protocol upgrades. The vaults leverage hybrid cryptography, blending classical cryptographic standards with quantum-resistant techniques to provide blockchain-agnostic security. Effectively, they allow the whales, holders of large amounts of a cryptocurrency, to secure their stashes while waiting for the machinations of blockchain governance to get it together. Crypto communities can't afford leisurely debates, he argues. “The BIP and EIP processes are great for governance, but terrible for rapid threat response,” said Dillion. ""When quantum hits, attackers won’t wait for community consensus.” Colton Dillon is speaking at the IEEE Canada Blockchain Forum, part of Consensus 2025 in Toronto. The IEEE is a Knowledge Partner of Consensus.

The latest wave of innovation is hitting how we consume media, and one exciting development comes from the realm of music streaming. Spotify is rolling out a significant update to its Spotify AI DJ feature, introducing interactive voice commands. This isn’t just about listening; it’s about telling your AI what you want to hear, marking a leap forward in personalized audio experiences. How Spotify AI DJ Voice Commands Work The Spotify AI DJ , first launched in early 2023, initially served as a curated stream with commentary. Now, it’s evolving into a truly interactive assistant. The core functionality revolves around using your voice to influence the music being played. Here’s a breakdown: Initiating the DJ: You can find the AI DJ by typing “DJ” in the Spotify search bar. Making Voice Requests: Once the DJ is active, you can hold down the dedicated DJ button (typically located on the bottom right) to speak your commands. What You Can Request: Users can ask the AI DJ to play specific songs, request tracks from particular artists, change the current genre, or even alter the overall mood of the playlist it’s generating. Quick Mood Change: If you don’t have a specific voice request but want to quickly shift the vibe, a quick press of the DJ button can prompt the AI to transition to a different style or mood. This feature is currently rolling out in over 60 markets, initially supporting English voice commands. This expansion makes the interactive AI DJ accessible to a much wider global audience, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with streaming technology . The Benefits of Enhanced Music Personalization Why is adding voice commands to the Spotify AI DJ such a big deal? It significantly enhances the user experience through deeper music personalization . Here are some key benefits: Effortless Control: Change the music without needing to navigate menus or type searches. Ideal for when you’re driving, cooking, or otherwise occupied. Dynamic Discovery: Instead of passively listening, you can actively guide the AI to explore different genres, artists, or moods on the fly, leading to more tailored music discovery. More Engaging Experience: The ability to talk to your AI DJ makes the interaction feel more like having a personal curator who responds to your immediate preferences. Instant Adaptation: Your mood can change rapidly. Voice commands allow the AI DJ to adapt almost instantly, ensuring the music always fits the moment. This level of control moves beyond traditional algorithmic playlists, offering a more fluid and responsive way to interact with Spotify’s vast library and the potential of AI music curation. The Technology Powering AI Music Interaction While the user experience is simple, the technology behind the Spotify AI DJ and its new voice capabilities is complex. It involves a combination of advanced AI models: Speech Recognition: Converting spoken voice commands into text or actionable instructions. Natural Language Processing (NLP): Understanding the intent and context of user requests, even if phrased casually or ambiguously. Recommendation Engines: Leveraging Spotify’s extensive data on user listening habits, musical attributes, and trends to select appropriate songs based on the voice commands. Generative AI (for commentary): While not directly tied to voice commands, the original DJ feature used generative AI to create the spoken commentary between songs, adding to the personalized feel. Integrating these components allows the AI DJ to not just understand what you say but also make intelligent decisions about the music it plays next, creating a seamless blend of user input and algorithmic curation. This sophisticated use of AI music technology is a testament to the potential of AI in enhancing digital services. Comparing Spotify’s AI DJ to Other AI Features Spotify isn’t new to leveraging AI. Besides the Spotify AI DJ , the company also introduced a feature allowing users to create playlists using text prompts. How does the interactive AI DJ with voice commands stack up? Text Prompt Playlists: This feature is great for creating a playlist based on a specific theme, activity, or mood described in text. It’s useful for building a static collection. Interactive AI DJ: The AI DJ is designed for dynamic, real-time listening. Voice commands allow for instant adjustments and continuous discovery within a live stream, rather than building a fixed list. Complementary Tools: These features serve different purposes. The text prompt tool is for curation and collection building, while the AI DJ with voice is for live, adaptive playback and exploration. Both features demonstrate Spotify’s commitment to using AI to improve music personalization , offering users different ways to interact with and discover music based on their needs and preferences at any given moment. They represent different facets of how streaming technology is evolving. Future Outlook and Potential Challenges The introduction of voice commands for the Spotify AI DJ opens up exciting possibilities for the future of music streaming. Imagine a truly conversational AI DJ that can discuss music, provide trivia, or even help you discover artists based on subtle nuances in your requests. However, there are potential challenges: Accuracy of Voice Recognition: Ensuring the AI accurately understands commands across different accents, languages, and background noise is crucial for user satisfaction. Natural Language Understanding: The AI needs to handle complex or ambiguous requests gracefully. Scalability: Rolling out sophisticated AI features like this globally, especially with multilingual support, requires significant infrastructure and ongoing development. User Adoption: Will users readily adopt talking to their music app? The feature needs to provide clear value and ease of use. Despite these challenges, the trajectory suggests a future where our interactions with streaming technology become increasingly intuitive and personalized, with AI music curators playing a central role. Actionable Insights for Users Ready to try out the new interactive Spotify AI DJ ? Here’s how you can make the most of the new voice commands : Experiment with Requests: Don’t just ask for specific songs. Try asking the DJ to “play something upbeat,” “switch to jazz,” or “play more songs like this one.” Refine Your Language: Pay attention to how the AI responds to different phrasing and adjust your commands for better results. Use the Quick Press: When you’re unsure what you want but need a change, a quick press of the DJ button is an easy way to refresh the music. Provide Feedback: While not a direct voice command feature, using Spotify’s feedback mechanisms can help improve the AI over time. Embracing these interactive features allows you to take greater control of your listening experience and unlock deeper levels of music personalization provided by this evolving AI music feature. Conclusion: A New Era of Music Interaction Spotify’s integration of voice commands into its Spotify AI DJ is a significant step forward in the evolution of music streaming. It transforms a passive listening experience into an interactive one, offering users unprecedented control over their real-time music personalization . This move highlights the growing impact of AI on how we interact with digital content and services.

Enter Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a low-priced token rapidly gaining attention from those who saw DOGE transform $5,000 into $300,000 in just six months. With its innovative approach to decentralized finance and the backing of a passionate community, MUTM is emerging as the next big opportunity. The project is already at Phase 4 of its presale and has already raised more than $8 million and more than 9,700 investors. With over 70% sold out during this stage, the price will go up by 20% to $0.03 in Phase 5 and with an expected launch price of $0.06. As crypto enthusiasts and Dogecoin investors look for the next big breakout, MUTM is shaping up to be a serious coin, potentially delivering gains that could rival DOGE’s past meteoric rise. Mutuum Finance: A New Era in DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance is not another DeFi wave-rider project it provides a twin lending mechanism incorporating Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) capabilities. The hybrid system offers stability as well as control to users. P2C Lending enables investors to receive yield by providing stablecoins such as USDT to lending pools that are governed by smart contracts, providing a safe and automated means of earning passive income. In contrast, P2P Lending allows direct borrowing and lending relations between users with no middlemen. This aspect enhances privacy and allows for more personalized lending, giving users more control over the transaction. Through this novel setup Mutuum Finance is now a viable and scalable product within the DeFi ecosystem. It is also currently undergoing a third-party audit by Certik to further enhance transparency and investor trust. Presale Growth and Launch Price Expectations Currently, at $0.025, the MUTM token is highly sought after. Those who invest now at this stage in Phase 4 are set to appreciate by 20% once Phase 5 begins. The market launch price is at $0.06, but some crypto analysts are already predicting it is going to be up within no time after its release, an exponential rise compared to today’s prices in the presale. These are the explanations why MUTM is one of the most debated low-price DeFi coins. Fueling Growth Through Community and Rewards The platform is also developing a thriving community with reward-based mechanics. There is an active leaderboard that shows the top 50 token holders and rewarding them with additional MUTM tokens. In addition, there is a token giveaway with a $100,000 prize ongoing, in which ten winners will receive $10,000 each in MUTM. A referral program also incentivizes user growth by rewarding participants who refer new users to the platform. Why Investors Are Taking Notice Mutuum Finance is becoming one of the most sensational early-stage decentralized finance opportunities. As the token draws near its next price milestone and launch, early investors would be much better off enjoying token appreciation along with platform rewards. Just as Dogecoin turned early believers into crypto legends, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now drawing in a new wave of investors chasing outsized gains, with some eyeing the potential to flip $5K into $300K within months. Already raising $8M+ from over 9,700 backers, and with Phase 4 over 70% sold out, MUTM is proving it’s not just hype, it’s momentum backed by innovation. With the next phase bringing a 20% price increase, and a launch target of $0.06, today’s entry point at $0.025 could be the last chance for investors to get in at the ground floor. Don’t wait until MUTM is trending, move now or risk missing the next DOGE-sized breakout.

Currently priced at $2.52 , XRP has dropped 3.05% in the last 24 hours , with a $147.33 billion market cap . While Ripple’s regulatory clarity has boosted investor confidence, its massive market cap limits its growth potential. Enter Ruvi . This presale crypto is going to outperform Ripple and deliver crazy returns. It’s early stage innovation + bonus packed presale = can’t miss opportunity for forward thinking investors. Ripple’s Past Success vs Ruvi’s Future Ripple’s blockchain has revolutionized cross border payments with its speed and scalability. Recent SEC clarity has solidified its position as a regulated crypto, attracting institutional interest. But here’s the thing: Ripple’s massive market cap means there’s limited room for the exponential gains we saw in its early days. Ruvi is in its early stage . By getting in on Ruvi’s presale you’re basically buying into the beginning of what could be the next XRP like success story. With its AI driven features and blockchain efficiencies Ruvi is going to disrupt the industry in ways Ripple can no longer. Where Ruvi Stands Out: Presale Bonuses A key difference? Ruvi’s presale bonus structure designed to reward early adopters big time. By getting in now you’ll increase your holdings before it hits the public market.

44589606,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=160069,1747184406,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Thailand Digital Bond: Unlocking $150M G-Token Opportunity,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/thailand-digital-bond-g-token/,"Are you interested in how traditional finance is converging with the world of digital assets? A significant development is unfolding in Southeast Asia, as Thailand takes a bold step into the realm of tokenized government bond issuances. The news centers around the planned issuance of a substantial Thailand digital bond , specifically a digital investment token dubbed the G-Token, by the nation’s Finance Ministry. What is the Planned G-Token Thailand Issuance? According to reports from Bloomberg, Thailand’s Finance Ministry is preparing to issue 5 billion baht, which translates to approximately $150 million USD, through a digital investment token known as the G-Token. This initiative was highlighted by Thailand’s Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister, Pichai Chunhavajira. He indicated that the G-Token issuance is expected to occur within the next two months, forming a part of the government’s broader budget borrowing strategy. The core idea behind this G-Token issuance is to leverage digital technology to streamline and potentially enhance the traditional bond market. While specific technical details about the underlying platform (likely a form of distributed ledger technology or blockchain) are still emerging, the focus is clearly on creating a digital representation of a sovereign debt instrument. Why Issue a Tokenized Government Bond? Exploring the Benefits The move towards a tokenized government bond offers several potential advantages, both for the issuer (the Thai government) and for investors. The Finance Minister pointed to a couple of key benefits directly: Accessibility for Small Investors: One significant aspect mentioned is that investors will be able to participate in the G-Token bond issuance with relatively small amounts of cash. Traditional government bonds often require high minimum investment thresholds, limiting access for individual retail investors. Tokenization, by allowing for fractional ownership, can democratize access to these financial instruments. Boosting Secondary Market Trading: The digital token format is anticipated to potentially boost secondary market bond trading. Tokenization can facilitate faster settlement times and potentially increase liquidity compared to traditional bond markets, which can sometimes be less efficient, especially for smaller trades. Beyond these specific points, the general benefits often associated with tokenizing assets, including bonds, can include: Increased Transparency: Transactions recorded on a distributed ledger can offer greater transparency (depending on the specific setup). Improved Efficiency: Automated processes via smart contracts can reduce manual effort and costs. 24/7 Trading Potential: Digital markets can theoretically operate around the clock, unlike traditional markets with set hours. Sovereign Digital Bond: Part of a Global Trend? Thailand’s plan to issue a sovereign digital bond is not happening in a vacuum. Governments and international financial institutions globally have been exploring or implementing similar initiatives. Examples include the European Investment Bank (EIB) which has issued digital bonds on a blockchain platform, and the World Bank which has also experimented with bond tokenization. These moves signal a growing interest among sovereign and quasi-sovereign entities in exploring how digital ledger technology can be applied to traditional capital markets. While each implementation varies in design and purpose, the overarching theme is the exploration of technology to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and potentially broaden investor bases for government debt. Implications for Thailand Blockchain Finance This G-Token issuance represents a significant step for the landscape of Thailand blockchain finance . It signals the government’s willingness to embrace digital asset technology beyond just cryptocurrencies, applying it to core financial infrastructure like debt markets. This could have several ripple effects: Validation: A government-backed digital asset issuance lends credibility to the broader blockchain and digital asset ecosystem within Thailand. Infrastructure Development: It may necessitate or accelerate the development of necessary digital infrastructure, regulatory frameworks, and technical expertise within the country. Innovation Catalyst: It could encourage further innovation and adoption of blockchain technology by private sector financial institutions in Thailand. This move aligns with Thailand’s broader digital transformation goals and its efforts to position itself as a technologically advanced nation in the region. Potential Challenges and Considerations While the benefits are promising, the path to successful implementation of a Thailand digital bond is not without potential challenges. These could include: Regulatory Clarity: Ensuring the appropriate legal and regulatory framework is in place for digital bonds. Investor Education: Educating both institutional and retail investors about this new format of investment. Technology Risk: Ensuring the underlying technology is secure, reliable, and scalable. Market Adoption and Liquidity: Building sufficient interest and infrastructure to ensure a liquid secondary market develops as hoped. Careful planning and execution will be crucial to navigate these potential hurdles. A Compelling Step Forward Thailand’s plan to issue a $150 million G-Token digital bond is a noteworthy development in the convergence of traditional finance and digital assets. By potentially lowering the barrier to entry for investors and aiming to enhance secondary market trading, this initiative could serve as a significant case study for how governments can leverage tokenization for sovereign debt. It underscores the growing relevance of blockchain and digital asset technology in mainstream financial markets and marks a positive stride for Thailand blockchain finance on the global stage.

TRON has set a new record for stablecoin supply at $71.9 billion in USDT, yet TRX struggles to break past $0.25. Solana, priced near $146, is holding steady while bulls and bears battle for control. Amid these uncertain moves, Unstaked has exploded onto the scene, raising over $1 million in just 24 hours and reaching more than $5 million in total presale funds. Currently in stage 10 at $0.008234, Unstaked offers a rare presale opportunity. With no insider allocations, every buyer gets the same chance at success in this viral project. TRON Battles $0.25 as Strong Fundamentals Fail to Lift Price TRON (TRX) has made big gains in the stablecoin sector with $71.9 billion in USDT, fueled by six billion-dollar USDT mints by Tether since April. The network has grown fast, with monthly DEX volume rising 40% from $3.4 billion in March to $4.9 billion in April. TRON now hosts over 302 million accounts and more than 10 billion transactions. Even with this strength, TRX trades at around $0.243 and struggles to break the $0.25 wall. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 48.7 reflects market uncertainty. If TRX loses the $0.240 support, analysts say $0.235 could be the next stop. TRON’s $5 billion total value locked and growing institutional interest show promise. However, the price remains stuck in a tight range and only a breakout above $0.25 can fuel a real rally. Solana Holds Steady as Bulls Watch for Breakout Solana continues to show solid network growth despite recent price stalling. Trading at around $146, Solana’s stablecoin supply has hit $13 billion, and its TVL has grown to $7.65 billion. It leads daily DEX activity with over 57.77 million daily transactions. The price moves in a range between $130 and $150, with key resistance at $156. Analysts see a possible rally to $220 if SOL breaks out of this bull flag pattern. Lower trading volumes show hesitation, leaving SOL hovering in a tight channel. Large investors like DeFi Development Corp and SOL Strategies are still accumulating, showing long-term belief in Solana. For now, short-term price action remains stuck as buyers and sellers wait for the next big move. Unstaked’s $0.00848 Presale Sparks Investor Excitement As TRON and Solana navigate through their market struggles, Unstaked has quickly gained attention from investors. In just one day, Unstaked raised over $1 million, taking its total presale to $5 million. The project has stood out by refusing insider or developer allocations. Instead, all tokens are sold directly to public participants, ensuring fairness and security for buyers. Currently in stage 10, Unstaked is priced at $0.008234, offering early supporters a rare chance to enter a project with strong potential. The launch price is set at $0.1819, which gives early buyers a significant upside. All activity is fully verifiable on-chain, reflecting the project’s commitment to transparency and safety. Unstaked AI introduces a platform where anyone can design, customise, and deploy their smart agents. These digital assistants are built to automate tasks, connect with audiences, and boost productivity. From social media handling to customer service and marketing automation, users can assign agents to meet their needs. The system is backed by blockchain, which guarantees that each agent is secure and owned by the user. Unlike traditional AI services run by large companies, Unstaked users have full control over their agents. The $UNSD token powers this platform and allows owners to enhance their agents’ features. Whether you are a creator wanting to grow your presence, a business aiming for efficiency, or a marketer seeking smarter automation, Unstaked delivers a flexible AI solution. This is not just another AI tool. It is your personal AI network built for you. Key Takeaway TRON’s network has expanded, with its stablecoin supply and user activity reaching records. Still, TRX struggles to hold above $0.25. Solana trades near $146, showing strong DeFi growth and attracting big investors, yet remains trapped in a limited price range. Meanwhile, Unstaked has caught early attention by raising over $1 million in just one day, with no insider allocations. The project’s focus on fairness and transparency has attracted buyers. At a crypto presale price of $0.008234 in stage 10, Unstaked gives a rare opening to those seeking high potential returns without the usual risks of speculative tokens.

The analyst still expects XRP to rally to four digits and has in the past explained why he believes such an ambitious price target is possible. XRP Price To Still Rally To $1,000 In an X post, BarriC stated that a potential XRP price rally to between $10 and $20 is just the beginning. He added that the long game for the altcoin is $1,000. The analyst urged market participants to be prepared for life-changing and generational wealth. In his other X posts, BarriC provided a roadmap for how it can reach four digits. Related Reading: Analyst Says These Factors Will Drive XRP Price To $1,000, But What Does Market Cap Say? In one post, he stated that once the XRP price reclaims $3, it will move rapidly to $5. The analyst predicts that the altcoin will then skyrocket into double digits, sitting comfortably at between $10 and $20 as a new all-time high. However, BarriC believes that is just the start for XRP as it will still reach $100 and then $1,000. He asserted that these price targets for XRP will happen much sooner than people think. In another post, the analyst alluded to banks using XRP as one factor that could spark this XRP price surge. BarriC stated that the fact that investors can still accumulate the altcoin at around $2 means that banks aren’t utilizing it yet. The analyst said that once banks and financial institutions worldwide adopt and utilize XRP in the way they conduct finance, the altcoin will skyrocket to $1,000. He referenced the 2017 bull cycle when the token’s price went from $0.006 to $3.80, which is why he is confident that such a parabolic surge is possible. The Altcoin Approaching Key Resistance Levels In an X post, crypto analyst CasiTrades stated that the XRP price is approaching key resistance levels following its latest surge. She highlighted $2.69 as the major resistance, as this price level is also the .236 Fib retracement from the all-time high (ATH) and a key level to watch for a correction. Related Reading: XRP Price To $1,000: Analyst Reveals Target For When Banks Start Using XRP Commenting on the current price action, she noted that what stands out is the continued price increase despite low momentum and a completed 5-wave count. The analyst remarked that this slow, controlled push higher often signals strong underlying demand, strong trend, and heavy accumulation. CasiTrades stated that if the XRP price breaks and holds above $2.69, it would open the door for an explosive move toward $3. However, if the altcoin doesn’t hold this level, she claimed it could record a short-term dip toward $2.30 for a reset. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.50, up almost 5% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

But even Ethereum’s remarkable growth leaves room for other projects to offer exponential returns. Enter Ruvi, the blockchain and AI-powered token that’s disrupting the crypto scene with an upcoming presale boasting unparalleled potential for early investors. Could Ruvi become the next big thing in crypto, offering returns that outperform Ethereum? Here’s everything you need to know. Ethereum’s dominance faces new competition Ethereum’s strengths lie in its vast ecosystem, innovative upgrades like Pectra, and its move to a greener proof-of-stake model. It’s the backbone of decentralized applications (dApps), with a legacy that commands respect. However, with ETH’s price hovering around $2,486.66, the multiplication factor for investors is diminishing. On the other hand, Ruvi combines the power of artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain to solve pressing global issues, from streamlining logistics to refining data analytics, setting itself apart as more than just an alternative to existing cryptocurrencies. And with presale tokens priced at only $0.01, Ruvi is a ground-floor opportunity that promises massive upside. What makes Ruvi stand out? The Ruvi presale is designed for early adopters looking to maximize their gains, with bonus structures that increase returns exponentially based on investment size. Ethereum may have revolutionized the crypto world, but Ruvi’s aggressive approach to incentivize early adoption sets a new standard for ROI potential. Investment scenarios with Ruvi Here’s how Ruvi’s token presale turns modest investments into life-changing wealth. Using conservative future projections between $1 and $3 per token, here are three examples to demonstrate Ruvi’s potential. Entry-level investment ($800) With an $800 investment, you’ll receive 80,000 Ruvi tokens during the presale. Thanks to the 40% bonus, you’ll gain an extra 32,000 tokens, bringing your total to 112,000 tokens. Future Value at $1: $112,000 Future Value at $3: $336,000 Mid-level investment ($1,500) A $1,500 investment nets you 150,000 Ruvi tokens. At this level, the presale adds a 60% bonus, translating into an additional 90,000 tokens, for a grand total of 240,000 tokens. Future Value at $1: $240,000 Future Value at $3: $720,000 High-level investment ($7,000) For more ambitious investors, a $7,000 commitment secures 700,000 Ruvi tokens, doubled by a 100% bonus to reach 1.4 million tokens in total. Future Value at $1: $1,400,000 Future Value at $3: $4,200,000 These figures highlight why Ruvi has been dubbed the most exciting presale in crypto today. Compared to Ethereum’s slower price growth, Ruvi offers an unparalleled potential for both entry-level and high-level investors. Ruvi vs Ethereum: where should you invest? Ethereum may be the backbone of dApps and DeFi, but it’s not immune to competition. Its current price at $2,486.66 makes it less accessible for small-scale investors looking to maximize growth. Meanwhile, Ruvi offers a low-cost entry point with a groundbreaking mix of blockchain and AI utility, ensuring it isn’t just another speculative asset. Where Ethereum focuses on sophisticated infrastructure and institutional adoption, Ruvi provides direct solutions and unparalleled ROI for early adopters. If Ethereum’s evolution has taught us anything, it’s that early movers always win big. And with Ruvi positioned to make waves across multiple industries, now could be the perfect time to ride this rising star. Don’t miss out on Ruvi’s presale The cryptocurrency market rewards those who act fast. Just as Ethereum’s earliest investors saw their modest contributions grow astronomically, Ruvi offers a similar opportunity—but only for those who enter while prices are still low. With tokens at just $0.01 and massive bonuses on the table, Ruvi’s presale is your chance to secure life-changing gains before the price soars. Don’t be the one who looks back in regret; become the investor who seized the opportunity to shape the future of crypto.

44589853,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=160070,1747185003,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Google Gemini Transforms Android Auto Driving Experience,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/google-gemini-android-auto/,"In the rapidly evolving world of technology, where advancements in artificial intelligence are capturing global attention, Google is making a significant move by integrating its cutting-edge Google Gemini generative AI model into vehicles. For many in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, keeping an eye on major tech shifts like this is crucial, as AI infrastructure often intersects with distributed computing and decentralized networks. This integration promises to redefine the in-car experience, making driving more intuitive and connected than ever before. What is Google Gemini Bringing to Android Auto AI? Google recently announced its plans to bring Google Gemini to cars supporting Android Auto within the next few months. This move, revealed ahead of the company’s 2025 I/O developer conference, signifies a major transformation in how drivers interact with their vehicles’ infotainment systems. According to Google, adding Gemini functionality to Android Auto, and later to cars running Google’s built-in operating system, will make driving “more productive and fun.” Patrick Brady, VP of Android for Cars, described this as one of the most significant changes to the in-vehicle experience in a long time. The integration of Android Auto AI powered by Gemini will manifest in two primary ways: Enhanced Voice Assistant: Gemini will serve as a much more capable voice assistant. Users (drivers or passengers) can issue commands for tasks like sending texts, playing music, or getting directions, similar to the existing Google Assistant. However, Gemini’s natural language processing capabilities mean users won’t need rigid, specific commands. They can speak more conversationally. Contextual Understanding: Gemini can retain context and remember user preferences. For instance, it could remember a contact prefers texts in a certain language and handle the translation automatically. Advanced Information Retrieval: A common in-car tech request is finding points of interest along a route. Gemini will excel here, capable of mining Google listings and reviews to answer specific queries, such as finding “taco places with vegan options” nearby. Exploring the Potential of In-car AI with Gemini Live Beyond standard voice commands, Google Gemini will introduce “Gemini Live.” This feature allows the AI to be essentially always listening and ready to engage in more open-ended conversations. This aspect of In-car AI pushes the boundaries of what’s possible: Open Conversations: Users can discuss a wide range of topics, from brainstorming travel ideas for a trip to getting recipe suggestions or even discussing historical facts. Interactive Experience: This moves beyond simple command-response to a more interactive and engaging digital companion within the vehicle. While the idea of an always-listening AI might raise questions about distraction, Google claims Gemini’s natural language abilities will actually reduce cognitive load by making interactions smoother and requiring less mental effort to formulate commands. This is a notable claim in an industry where some users are requesting a return to physical controls over complex touchscreens. Addressing Challenges and Future Possibilities for Generative AI in Vehicles Implementing advanced Generative AI like Gemini in a dynamic environment like a car presents challenges. Initially, Gemini will rely on Google’s cloud processing for both Android Auto and cars with Google Built-In. However, Google is collaborating with automakers to integrate more compute power into vehicles, enabling Gemini to run at the edge. Running AI models locally can improve performance and reliability, crucial factors in a moving vehicle that might experience inconsistent network connectivity. Modern cars also generate vast amounts of data from sensors, cameras, and other systems. The potential for AI in cars to leverage this multimodal data is significant. While Google hasn’t made specific announcements yet, the company acknowledges the potential use cases, particularly with the increasing number of cameras in vehicles. This could lead to future features that are currently only theoretical. Who Gets Google Gemini and When? The rollout of Google Gemini on Android Auto and Google Built-In will extend to all countries where Google’s generative AI model is currently available. The service will support more than 40 languages, ensuring broad accessibility for users worldwide. This integration marks a significant step in bringing sophisticated AI capabilities directly into the daily lives of drivers. As AI technology continues to advance, its presence in commonplace devices like car infotainment systems highlights the broader trend of AI becoming increasingly embedded in our physical world, a trend that has interesting parallels and implications for the development of decentralized technologies and the infrastructure that supports both AI and blockchain. In conclusion, Google’s introduction of Gemini to Android Auto is set to dramatically change the in-car user experience. By providing a more natural, intelligent, and conversational interface, this Android Auto AI aims to make driving more efficient and enjoyable. While challenges related to processing power and data utilization are still being addressed, the potential for future enhancements using vehicle data is substantial. This move underscores the growing importance of Generative AI and In-car AI , pushing the boundaries of what we expect from connected vehicles.

According to analyst Josh, XRP is showing strong signs of a bullish trend right now. A bearish signal that had been hanging over the market for months has finally been invalidated. Since the start of the year, analysts were watching a bearish divergence play out — but now, XRP’s RSI on the 3-day chart has made a higher high. That’s a clear sign the bearish phase is over, and the market can start expecting more positive momentum ahead. XRP Price Analysis: On the daily chart, things look even better. XRP has officially broken out above a key resistance level at around $2.46. This daily candle close above resistance confirms the breakout and signals the start of a new bullish trend. In other words — XRP is no longer stuck in a downtrend and is starting to move upward again. The next important price levels to watch as possible resistance points are $2.60, $2.77, $2.95, $3.15, and $3.30. As for support, the old resistance line at $2.45–$2.46 is now expected to act as a new support zone. Overall, the XRP price chart is flashing bullish signals. The market has cleared out the earlier negative patterns, confirmed a breakout, and regained momentum. If Bitcoin and the broader crypto market also stay bullish, it could give XRP and other altcoins an extra boost in the coming days. Are Sellers Being Absorbed on Binance? XRP futures trading is showing signs of life again, with open interest rising after a sharp drop, hinting at growing trader interest and possible volatility ahead. The market is currently balanced, but short positions are quietly increasing while XRP’s price holds steady — a sign that sellers might be getting absorbed by bigger buyers.

A recent incident in Paris serves as a stark and unwelcome reminder that the risks associated with significant crypto holdings aren’t confined to the digital realm. Physical security is paramount, and a shocking event unfolded that highlights this critical need for enhanced Crypto entrepreneur security . The Alarming Incident: A Look at the Cryptocurrency Kidnapping Attempt Reports emerged detailing a terrifying incident in the heart of Paris, France. According to The Block, a targeted attack occurred aimed at the family of a cryptocurrency entrepreneur. The specific event involved an attempted Cryptocurrency kidnapping . Here’s what we know based on the initial reports: Location: The incident took place in the 11th arrondissement of Paris. Time: The attempt occurred in the morning, around 8:20 a.m. local time. Targets: The masked assailants reportedly attempted to abduct the entrepreneur’s daughter and grandchild. Perpetrators: Three masked men were involved in the attempted abduction. Current Status: Paris police are actively investigating and are said to be hunting for the suspects involved in this disturbing event. This wasn’t a random act; it was a targeted strike, seemingly motivated by the perceived wealth linked to the crypto entrepreneur. It underscores a growing concern within the community: as crypto assets become more valuable and individuals’ holdings grow, they can become targets for physical crime. Why Target Crypto Wealth? Understanding the Motivation Behind Paris Crime Crypto The world of cryptocurrency is often associated with anonymity or pseudonymity, leading some to believe that crypto wealth is untouchable by traditional criminals. However, this incident, and others like it, demonstrate a dangerous reality. Individuals known or believed to possess significant crypto assets can become high-value targets for physical crime, including kidnapping, extortion, and home invasions. Several factors make Crypto wealth security a unique challenge and contribute to incidents like the one seen in Paris: Perceived High Value: Crypto’s rapid price appreciation has created many new millionaires and billionaires, often publicly known or suspected. This visible or rumored wealth attracts criminal attention. Difficulty in Recovery: While blockchain transactions are transparent, tracing funds quickly and recovering them after a forced transfer can be incredibly difficult, making it an attractive target for criminals seeking irreversible gains. Information Leakage: Details about large holdings or successful crypto ventures can sometimes be gleaned from public profiles, social media, or even careless conversations, providing criminals with potential targets. Physical Vulnerability: Unlike digital hacks which require technical skill, physical attacks leverage basic criminal tactics – intimidation, force, and coercion – to gain access to digital assets held by a person. The convergence of significant, potentially hard-to-trace wealth and the physical presence of the asset holder creates a dangerous scenario, contributing to the rise of incidents categorized under Paris crime crypto and similar events globally. Beyond the Headlines: What This Means for Crypto Entrepreneur Security This attempted kidnapping in Paris serves as a grave warning. It’s a reminder that the security strategy for anyone with significant crypto holdings must extend far beyond digital wallets and private keys. Crypto entrepreneur security needs to encompass robust personal and physical security measures. The challenge lies in the fact that while digital security can be managed remotely, physical security requires constant vigilance and proactive measures in the real world. High-profile individuals in the crypto space, or even those simply known within their local community to have done well in crypto, face risks that require professional assessment and planning. Examples of past incidents, ranging from home invasions targeting hardware wallets to physical threats aimed at extorting crypto, highlight that this is not an isolated phenomenon but a growing concern that security experts are increasingly addressing. Actionable Insights: Enhancing Security for Crypto Holders While the Paris incident is unsettling, it provides an opportunity for the community to reassess and strengthen security practices. Enhancing Security for crypto holders involves a multi-layered approach: 1. Bolster Physical Security: Discretion: Be extremely cautious about discussing your crypto holdings or success publicly or even among casual acquaintances. Home Security: Invest in advanced home security systems, including alarms, cameras, reinforced entry points, and potentially safe rooms. Routine Variance: Avoid predictable daily routines that criminals could exploit. Professional Assessment: Consider hiring security consultants to assess your personal risk profile and recommend tailored physical security measures. Travel Safety: Be extra vigilant when traveling, especially to unfamiliar locations. 2. Strengthen Digital Security (Still Crucial): Cold Storage: Store significant amounts of crypto offline using hardware wallets or other cold storage methods. Strong Authentication: Use strong, unique passwords and enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) on all accounts. Beware of Phishing: Be highly skeptical of unsolicited messages or links asking for personal or wallet information. Limit Online Information: Minimize the amount of personal information linked to your crypto activities online. 3. Manage Information Exposure: Social Media: Be mindful of what you post online that could indicate wealth, location, or daily habits. Public Appearances: If you are a public figure in crypto, work with security professionals for events and appearances. Implementing these steps can significantly reduce the risk of becoming a target for physical attacks motivated by crypto wealth. It’s not about living in fear, but about taking sensible precautions in a landscape where digital success can unfortunately create real-world vulnerabilities. The ongoing police hunt in Paris is a critical development, and the community awaits further information regarding the suspects and their potential connection to the victim’s crypto activities. This event serves as a somber reminder that as the crypto world evolves, so too do the methods employed by criminals seeking to exploit it. The safety of individuals and their families must be a top priority. This incident in Paris underscores the urgent need for increased awareness and proactive measures regarding physical security within the crypto community.

44590455,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=160072,1747186251,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shockwave: Abraxas Capital’s Massive $478M Ethereum Purchase Signals Strong Institutional Confidence,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/abraxas-capital-buys-ethereum/,"The world of cryptocurrency often witnesses significant movements, but few grab attention quite like a major institutional player making a substantial investment. Recent reports indicate that asset manager Abraxas Capital has been on an aggressive accumulation spree, particularly focused on Ethereum (ETH). This move, involving hundreds of millions of dollars, is not just a headline; it’s a potential indicator of shifting sentiment and growing confidence among traditional finance giants regarding the digital asset space, specifically concerning Ethereum . What Exactly Did Abraxas Capital Acquire? According to data highlighted by blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain on the social media platform X, Abraxas Capital has significantly increased its holdings of Ethereum over a very short period. The core of the news reveals a staggering acquisition: Over the past six days, Abraxas Capital reportedly purchased a total of 211,030 ETH . At the time of the report, this substantial accumulation was valued at approximately $477.6 million . A notable portion of this came in the last 12 hours preceding the report, with an additional 33,482 ETH acquired, valued at around $84.7 million . This rapid pace of acquisition underscores a deliberate strategy by Abraxas Capital to build a significant position in Ethereum . Such large-scale purchases by institutional entities are often interpreted as bullish signals for the underlying asset and the broader crypto market . Why Are Institutions Like Abraxas Capital Looking at Ethereum? The interest from institutional players in Ethereum is multifaceted. While Bitcoin is often seen as ‘digital gold’ and the primary store of value in the crypto space, Ethereum offers a different value proposition that appeals to sophisticated investors: Foundation of Web3: Ethereum is the leading smart contract platform, serving as the backbone for decentralized finance (DeFi), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps). Investing in ETH is, in essence, investing in the infrastructure of the next generation of the internet. Yield Opportunities: With the transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), Ethereum offers staking rewards. Institutions can earn a yield on their ETH holdings, making it an attractive asset compared to traditional low-yield investments. Network Effect: Ethereum boasts the largest developer community and the most established ecosystem among smart contract platforms. This network effect creates a powerful moat, attracting more users and innovation. Evolving Economics: The implementation of EIP-1559 introduced a burning mechanism for transaction fees, making ETH potentially deflationary under certain network conditions. This scarcity model is appealing to investors. Diversification: For institutions primarily holding Bitcoin or traditional assets, adding Ethereum provides diversification within the digital asset class, capturing exposure to the smart contract and dApp ecosystem. Abraxas Capital ‘s decision to allocate nearly half a billion dollars towards Ethereum suggests a strong conviction in these underlying fundamentals and the long-term growth potential of the network. What Does This Massive Purchase Mean for the Crypto Market and ETH Price? Institutional inflows of this magnitude can have several significant impacts on the crypto market and specifically the ETH price : Potential Impact Area Explanation Increased Demand Large purchases directly increase demand for ETH, potentially pushing the price upwards, especially if supply on exchanges is limited. Market Confidence Significant buys by known entities like Abraxas Capital signal validation to other investors, potentially encouraging further institutional and retail participation. Liquidity Dynamics As institutions accumulate and potentially move assets off exchanges for long-term holding or staking, it can reduce available supply for trading, impacting market liquidity. Price Stability (Potentially) Institutional holders often have longer time horizons than retail traders, which could contribute to more stable price action in the long run, although volatility remains inherent in the crypto market . Narrative Building These events reinforce the narrative of institutional adoption, which is a key driver for broader market growth and regulatory clarity. While a single purchase, even a large one, doesn’t guarantee a sustained price increase, it adds significant buying pressure and contributes positively to the overall market sentiment surrounding Ethereum and the viability of the crypto market for large-scale investment. Are There Challenges or Risks Associated with Such Large Institutional Bets? Investing in cryptocurrency, even for experienced asset managers like Abraxas Capital , comes with inherent risks and challenges: Market Volatility: The crypto market is known for its extreme price swings. A nearly $500 million position is subject to significant fluctuations, potentially leading to substantial unrealized gains or losses in short periods. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Changes in regulations could impact the usability, legality, or tax treatment of Ethereum holdings. Security Risks: Holding large amounts of digital assets requires robust security measures to protect against hacks, theft, or loss of private keys. Institutions must employ sophisticated custody solutions. Execution Risk: Acquiring such a large amount of ETH without significantly moving the market requires careful execution, often utilizing over-the-counter (OTC) desks rather than public exchanges. Liquidity for Exit: While the market is liquid, exiting a position of this size without impacting the ETH price could also present challenges. Abraxas Capital , as a professional asset manager, is undoubtedly aware of these risks and likely has strategies in place to mitigate them. Their willingness to proceed with such a large investment suggests they believe the potential rewards outweigh these challenges. Looking Ahead: What Could This Mean for the Future of Ethereum? The move by Abraxas Capital is more than just a snapshot in time; it’s a data point contributing to a larger trend of increasing institutional interest in Ethereum . If more asset managers follow suit, the implications could be profound: Increased Stability: Greater institutional participation could potentially lead to a more mature and stable market over time, as large holders are less likely to engage in panic selling. Further Innovation: Institutional capital flowing into the ecosystem can help fund development and innovation within the Ethereum network and its associated dApps. Regulatory Clarity: As more established financial players enter the space, it increases the pressure on regulators to provide clear guidelines, which can benefit the entire crypto market . Mainstream Adoption: Institutional adoption paves the way for easier access and understanding for mainstream investors and corporations. The long-term ETH price trajectory will depend on a confluence of factors, including network development, regulatory environment, macroeconomic conditions, and continued adoption. However, significant institutional accumulation like that seen from Abraxas Capital is undoubtedly a positive sign for the asset’s future prospects. Conclusion: A Bullish Signal from a Big Player Abraxas Capital ‘s reported acquisition of 211,030 ETH, valued at nearly $478 million, over just six days is a powerful statement. It highlights growing institutional conviction in Ethereum as a core digital asset, separate from or alongside Bitcoin. This significant capital inflow provides a strong vote of confidence in the network’s technology, ecosystem, and future potential. While the crypto market remains volatile and subject to various influences, moves of this scale from established asset managers are key indicators of the ongoing maturation and increasing acceptance of digital assets within traditional finance. Investors and enthusiasts alike will be watching closely to see how this trend develops and its ultimate impact on the ETH price and the broader market.

44591099,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=160075,1747187445,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Tencent Secures Controversial Microsoft AI Team WizardLM,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/tencent-hires-microsoft-wizardlm/,"In a significant development within the artificial intelligence landscape, Chinese tech giant Tencent appears to have onboarded the WizardLM team, a group of AI researchers previously associated with Microsoft. This move is particularly noteworthy given WizardLM’s recent history and highlights the intense competition for top AI talent and technology. Tencent’s Strategic Move in AI Tencent, the powerhouse behind platforms like WeChat and popular games including PUBG Mobile, is making aggressive strides in artificial intelligence. The company’s AI development organization, Hunyuan, is reportedly the new home for the WizardLM researchers. This strategic acquisition underscores Tencent’s commitment to bolstering its AI capabilities and accelerating its model development efforts. Can Xu, a senior AI researcher who played a leading role in several WizardLM projects, announced the team’s departure from Microsoft to join Tencent’s Hunyuan group via a post on X. Understanding WizardLM’s Past at Microsoft AI The WizardLM team, which originated several years ago, has a somewhat unusual past, particularly during its time under the Microsoft AI umbrella. In April 2024, the team released the WizardLM-2 family of AI models, which they claimed were competitive with leading models like OpenAI’s GPT-4. However, these models were quickly pulled from public access by Microsoft after just one day. The reason cited was a missed step in the release process: toxicity testing. The team acknowledged this oversight on X, stating they were completing the testing and planned to re-release the models soon. The Fallout from WizardLM-2’s Removal Despite Microsoft’s swift action, users had already downloaded and reuploaded the original WizardLM-2 models, along with customized versions. The sudden removal also caused disruption within the open-source AI community. Hugging Face CEO Clément Delangue noted that the deletion of WizardLM models, which were downloaded hundreds of thousands of times monthly, harmed numerous open-source projects dependent on them. This incident highlighted the complexities and responsibilities involved in releasing powerful AI models, even for established tech giants like Microsoft. Tencent’s Growing Hunyuan AI Power With the integration of the WizardLM team, Tencent’s Hunyuan AI efforts are expected to gain further momentum. Hunyuan has recently launched various AI models, including generators for video and 3D objects. The collaboration has already yielded results, with the release of the Hunyuan-TurboS 0416 model. Qingfeng Sun, identifying as a “co-founder” of WizardLM, has claimed that Hunyuan-TurboS 0416 surpasses certain “open” AI models, specifically mentioning Google’s Gemma 3 series, in performance. This suggests that the WizardLM team is continuing its focus on developing high-performing AI models within its new environment. Tencent has significantly increased its investment in AI infrastructure and recently restructured the Hunyuan team into two new units. The company attributed an 8% year-over-year growth in Q1 2025 partly to its AI investments. Tencent plans substantial capital expenditures this year, approximately 90 billion yuan (around $12.49 billion), with a significant portion allocated to fuel its AI ambitions. The addition of the WizardLM team aligns with this aggressive investment strategy aimed at strengthening Tencent’s position in the global AI race. Implications for the Future of AI Models The acquisition of a skilled team like WizardLM by Tencent signifies the ongoing talent war in the AI sector. While the exact number of researchers moving to Tencent is unclear, the integration of their expertise into the Hunyuan platform is likely to accelerate the development of new AI models. The competition between major players like Tencent, Microsoft, Google, and others continues to drive innovation. The rapid release and comparison of models like Hunyuan-TurboS 0416 against competitors underscore the fast-paced nature of this field. The move also raises questions about the future direction of open-source contributions from teams previously associated with large corporations and the balance between rapid development and responsible deployment, as highlighted by the WizardLM-2 incident. In conclusion, Tencent’s reported hiring of the WizardLM team from Microsoft is a major development that strengthens its Hunyuan AI division. Despite WizardLM’s controversial history surrounding the release and subsequent withdrawal of its models at Microsoft, the team’s expertise is now set to contribute to Tencent’s ambitious AI goals. This move highlights the intense competition for AI talent and resources, promising further advancements and shifts in the landscape of AI model development.

He also announced that Coinbase is investing an undisclosed sum in it to increase access to tokenized Canadian dollars at the Blockchain Futurist Conference in Toronto. According to Matheson, they requested the federal government create a national digital assets strategy. Based on his argument, crypto is strategic; therefore, they hoped the new administration would recognize the strategic importance of cryptocurrency. This followed the April federal elections in Canada, which resulted in the election of Prime Minister Mark Carney, who had previously expressed disapproval of cryptocurrencies. Matheson highlights the necessity of a stablecoin for the Canadian market In an exclusive interview on May 13, Matheson acknowledged the existence of a stablecoin for Canadians as crucial. He further stated that stablecoins are particularly necessary because the nation has “no peer-to-peer [payment] rail” and “wire transfers cost $45 and take 45 minutes of paperwork.” Moreover, he claimed that stablecoins make it possible to make 24/7, instantaneous, borderless payments, which was already possible with current technology. According to Stablecorp’s website, the most recent report on QCAD’s fiat reserve backing was from July 2024, when there was only about $175,000 worth of QCAD in circulation. On the other hand, the US dollar-backed stablecoins Tether and USDC make up the majority of the stablecoins’ $245 billion market capitalization as of May 13, according to CoinGecko data. In light of these variations in the stablecoins, Matheson emphasized the need for a stablecoin created especially for the Canadian market to solve present problems with the payment infrastructure. In addition, Coinbase stated in a blog post on March 26 that Canada lacked a clear path for stablecoin adoption , partly because its government has not yet removed securities regulation barriers for fiat-backed stablecoins. The exchange further stated that it must start considering instruments instead of securities. Meanwhile, according to the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s April statement, if stablecoins were only promoted to make payments, they are not considered securities in the country. Canadian voters expressed their strong desire for a digital assets strategy during the April election According to WonderFi CEO and President Dean Skurka, Canadian voters demonstrated that they wanted the government to take action on cryptocurrency when they cast their ballots on April 28. Based on his argument, this could be achieved if policymakers followed the United States and Europe in fostering an environment more conducive to blockchain development. Additionally, that month, Canadians eagerly awaited the political leaders’ plans regarding digital assets as the country’s federal election approached. This resulted from millions of Canadians owning, using, or working in cryptocurrency, which was becoming an increasingly important area for innovation and economic growth. Most of this active base was under 50, making them a powerful political force. The election and the administration had an opportunity for policymakers to encourage voters’ desire for clarity regarding Canada’s digital future. In 2022, Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre gained popularity when he supported Bitcoin and decentralized finance, giving people more control over their finances and, therefore, less control over politicians and banks. He aimed to make Canada the world’s blockchain capital and for its people to embrace digital currencies such as Bitcoin to escape inflation. While he is a fan of digital innovation, Mark Carney, a former governor of the Bank of Canada affiliated with the Liberal Party, has yet to be persuaded that digital coins such as stablecoins will upend the monetary system. He has argued that digital currency would have a more solid and secure foundation because of central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs He said stablecoins were not a revolutionary alternative to the traditional monetary system but merely an extension. Carney stated that CBDCs would form the basis of a more stable, programmable financial future and lower the risks associated with digital currency.

The focus? The Federal Reserve and the possibility of an Interest Rate Cut . Understanding the Trump Fed Pressure Donald Trump has a history of expressing strong opinions regarding the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy, particularly its benchmark interest rate. His recent remarks on Truth Social continue this trend, directly urging the Fed to lower rates again. This isn’t just a casual suggestion; it’s a pointed commentary aimed at influencing the independent central bank’s decisions. Why is Trump pushing for this now? He points to what he sees as falling prices in the U.S., arguing that this indicates a lack of inflation. His logic is straightforward: if prices aren’t rising, or are even declining, then the primary reason the Fed might keep rates high (controlling inflation) isn’t valid. He contrasts the U.S. situation with that of Europe and China, which have pursued lower interest rate policies, suggesting the U.S. should follow suit to remain competitive or stimulate growth. Key Argument: Falling prices negate the need for high rates. Comparative Stance: U.S. should align with lower rates seen in Europe and China. Underlying Goal: Likely aims to stimulate economic activity. Why the Call for an Interest Rate Cut ? Examining the Logic An Interest Rate Cut by the Federal Reserve typically serves to make borrowing money cheaper for businesses and consumers. This can encourage spending and investment, potentially boosting economic growth. Trump’s argument hinges on the idea that the current economic climate, characterized by his perception of falling prices and lack of inflation, warrants such stimulus rather than restrictive monetary policy. However, the Fed’s perspective is often more nuanced. They look at a wide range of economic indicators, including employment data, wage growth, consumer spending, and crucially, various measures of Inflation Data . While some specific prices might fall, the overall inflation picture, according to official metrics like the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, is what the Fed primarily monitors to achieve its dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices. Comparing the U.S. to Europe and China is also complex. Each economy faces unique challenges and operates under different structures. While lower rates might be appropriate for their specific conditions, the Fed must set policy based on the health and outlook of the US Economy . The Current State of the US Economy and the Fed’s Stance The Federal Reserve operates independently of political pressure, though it is accountable to Congress. Its decisions on interest rates are made by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) based on extensive economic analysis. In recent times, the Fed aggressively raised rates to combat inflation that surged after the pandemic. More recently, they have paused rate hikes, signaling a data-dependent approach. The current state of the US Economy is subject to various interpretations. While the labor market has remained relatively strong, there are ongoing debates about the pace of inflation reduction, the impact of higher rates on different sectors, and the potential for a future slowdown. The Fed has repeatedly stated it wants to see clear evidence that inflation is sustainably moving towards its 2% target before considering rate cuts. Challenges the Fed faces include: Balancing inflation control with supporting economic growth. Navigating global economic uncertainties. Maintaining credibility and independence from political influence, like the Trump Fed Pressure . Interpreting conflicting economic signals (e.g., strong jobs vs. potential manufacturing slowdown). Potential Crypto Market Impact of Rate Decisions So, why should cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors pay attention to this debate over an Interest Rate Cut ? Because monetary policy decisions by the Fed can have a significant Crypto Market Impact . Here’s a simplified look at the connection: Lower Interest Rates: Make traditional, safer investments (like bonds or savings accounts) less attractive due to lower returns. Can lead investors to seek higher returns in riskier assets. Increase liquidity in the financial system, making capital more available. Can potentially benefit risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies, as investors might allocate more capital to them in search of yield or growth. Higher Interest Rates (or maintaining high rates): Make traditional assets more attractive, drawing capital away from riskier investments. Reduce liquidity as borrowing becomes more expensive. Can put downward pressure on assets perceived as speculative, including cryptocurrencies. Therefore, the prospect of an Interest Rate Cut , especially if it signals a shift towards easier monetary policy, is often viewed positively by the crypto market. Conversely, the Fed maintaining higher rates, or even the threat of future hikes (though less likely now), can be seen as a headwind. What About Inflation Data and its Role? Trump’s argument heavily relies on his interpretation of falling prices and lack of Inflation Data . However, the Fed looks at a broader, more official set of statistics. While some goods might see price declines, the services sector and wages have shown more persistence in inflation. The Fed’s decisions are heavily weighted by whether they believe inflation is truly under control and moving towards their target. If the official Inflation Data remains sticky, the Fed will be hesitant to cut rates, regardless of political calls like the Trump Fed Pressure . A premature cut could risk reigniting inflationary pressures, forcing the Fed to potentially hike rates again later, which would likely be disruptive for the US Economy and financial markets, including potentially a negative Crypto Market Impact . Actionable Insights for Crypto Watchers Given the potential Crypto Market Impact , what should you watch? Fed Meetings: Pay close attention to FOMC meeting announcements and press conferences. Listen for clues about their outlook on inflation, employment, and future rate plans. Economic Data: Monitor key economic releases, especially official Inflation Data (CPI, PCE), jobs reports, and GDP growth. These are the metrics guiding the Fed. Political Commentary: While not directly controlling the Fed, political pressure like the Trump Fed Pressure can add noise and sometimes signal broader political priorities regarding the US Economy . Market Reactions: Observe how the crypto market reacts immediately following Fed announcements and major economic data releases. Conclusion: Navigating the Economic Winds Donald Trump’s renewed calls for an Interest Rate Cut highlight the ongoing debate about the direction of the US Economy and the appropriate stance for the Federal Reserve. While his arguments center on falling prices and comparison to other global economies, the Fed’s decision-making process is guided by a broader set of official Inflation Data and economic indicators, striving for price stability and maximum employment. For those interested in the potential Crypto Market Impact , understanding the dynamics between monetary policy, inflation, and economic growth is crucial. An Interest Rate Cut could potentially serve as a tailwind for risk assets like cryptocurrencies, but the timing and context of such a move are paramount. The ongoing Trump Fed Pressure adds a political layer to an already complex economic picture. Ultimately, the Fed will make its decision based on the data, but the public discussion, fueled by figures like Trump, keeps the spotlight firmly on the critical role of interest rates in the global financial landscape.

The IPO raised about $310 million, with the company and existing investors selling nearly six million shares . With that, eToro has been valued at around $4.2 billion in a successful debut on the public markets in a cautiously optimistic period for tech IPOs. EToro said in its prospectus that BlackRock had expressed interest in buying $100 million shares at the IPO price. The company planned to sell 5 million shares in the offering, with existing investors and executives selling another 5 million. Crypto boom drives eToro’s $50M profit surge eToro had the financial footing to ease its path to a successful IPO. In 2024, the company said, net income surged to $192.4 million from $15.3 million. This growth reflected the platform’s rising interest in cryptocurrency and the active participation of users worldwide. The company has been ramping up its crypto business, with revenue from crypto assets more than tripling to over $12 million in 2024. One-quarter of its net trading contribution last year came from crypto, up from 10% the prior year. eToro generates revenue from trading fees through spreads on buy and sell orders and from non-trading services, like currency conversions and withdrawal fees. It competes with other upstart retail trading platforms, including Robinhood and Webull, in offering traditional stock trading and access to crypto assets. By December 2024, the company had 3.5 million funded accounts from more than 75 countries, which showed a growing international momentum. eToro revives investor confidence with strong IPO The timing of eToro’s public offering could not be better. The IPO market stopped in recent years but has shown signs of life. The return of President Donald Trump to the White House in January 2025 and the stabilization of interest rates and decline in inflation have breathed new life into the public offerings market. Earlier in the year, GPU cloud infrastructure company CoreWeave went public with a successful debut, opening the door for companies like eToro, Klarna, and StubHub to dip their toes. Temporary fears over tariffs had delayed their plans, but eToro moved ahead after market confidence started to return. This is not eToro’s first try at going public. It had intended to merge with a special-purpose acquisition vehicle, or SPAC, in a deal that would have valued the business at more than $10 billion by 2022. But that plan was grounded by a larger market slide. Yoni Assia, the chief executive and a co-founder of the company, which was founded in 2007 with his brother Ronen Assia and David Ring, said earlier in 2024 that they were continuing to ready the company for a public debut, “assessing the right opportunity.” Now officially listed on the Nasdaq, eToro is set to drive a paradigm shift in how ordinary people trade, invest, and participate in financial markets. The success of eToro’s IPO is now increasingly being closely followed as a litmus test for the pipeline of tech and fintech IPOs, with companies like Hinge Health and Chime next in line to do so.

All three victims suffered injuries and were taken to a local hospital. Local outlet Le Parisien reported that the botched daylight kidnapping is being investigated by the Brigade for the Suppression of Banditry, a special police unit of the French Ministry of the Interior. Michael Englander, co-founder and CEO of Polish crypto exchange Plasbit , says this incident should serve as a wake-up call for the rest of the industry. “If you’re in crypto and still flaunting it online, you’re not just stupid, you’re putting your family in danger,” he said in a May 13 post to X. Offline crypto-linked attacks grow Crypto-focused lawyer Sasha Hodder said on X that “crypto theft is evolving. It’s not just social engineering or SIM swaps anymore.” In May, Las Vegas police said three teenagers had allegedly kidnapped a man at gunpoint who was returning from a local crypto event and robbed him of $4 million in crypto and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). On May 3, Paris police freed the father of a crypto entrepreneur who was held for several days in connection with a 7 million euro ($7.8 million) kidnapping plot. At the start of the year, David Balland, co-founder of crypto hardware wallet manufacturer Ledger, was abducted from his home in central France during the early hours of Jan. 21. He was held captive until a police operation on the night of Jan. 22 secured his release.

44591629,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=160084,1747188639,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,SEC Solana ETF Decision: Uncertainty Lingers After Delay,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-solana-etf-delay/,"The world of cryptocurrency ETFs is buzzing, but not always with good news. The latest development stirring the pot involves a potential new player: Solana. Specifically, Grayscale’s ambitious proposal for a Spot Solana ETF has hit a temporary roadblock. According to reports, the SEC Solana ETF decision timeline has been pushed back. This news, initially shared by Unfolded on X, indicates that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) needs more time to deliberate on Grayscale’s application. For many watching the space, this Solana ETF delay isn’t entirely surprising, given the SEC’s cautious approach to new crypto products, especially those beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Understanding the Grayscale Solana ETF Proposal Grayscale is a familiar name in the crypto investment landscape, known for its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which recently converted into a spot Bitcoin ETF. Building on that success and the growing interest in alternative cryptocurrencies, Grayscale proposed a spot ETF that would hold Solana (SOL) directly. A spot ETF allows investors to gain exposure to the price movements of an underlying asset without directly owning the asset itself. For a Grayscale Solana ETF , this would mean the fund holds actual SOL tokens, and investors buy shares in the fund. This structure is often preferred by traditional investors and institutions as it fits within existing regulatory frameworks and investment platforms. The potential benefits of such a product are significant: Increased Accessibility: Makes investing in Solana easier for traditional investors. Enhanced Liquidity: Could bring more capital into the Solana ecosystem. Regulatory Clarity: An approved ETF provides a level of legitimacy and regulatory comfort. Institutional Adoption: Opens the door for large institutions to invest in Solana. However, getting any crypto ETF approved, especially for an altcoin like Solana, is a complex process subject to stringent crypto ETF regulation . Why the SEC Decision Delay? The SEC’s primary mandate is investor protection. When considering a new financial product like a Spot Solana ETF, they scrutinize various factors. A SEC decision delay typically signals that the commission requires additional time to review the application thoroughly, gather more information, or address specific concerns. Potential reasons for this delay could include: Market Surveillance and Manipulation Concerns: The SEC needs to be confident that the underlying market for Solana is resistant to manipulation. While the Bitcoin market is large and has established surveillance sharing agreements (particularly with the CME futures market), the SEC might have different or additional questions regarding the Solana spot market structure, liquidity, and trading venues. Solana’s Unique Characteristics: Unlike Bitcoin, Solana utilizes a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism and has different network dynamics. The SEC may be evaluating the implications of these technical differences from a regulatory standpoint. Precedent Setting: Approving a Spot Solana ETF would set a significant precedent for other altcoin ETFs. The SEC might be cautious about opening the floodgates to a wide array of single-asset altcoin ETFs without a clear framework or criteria. Application Complexity: ETF applications are detailed documents. The SEC might have questions about the fund’s structure, custody arrangements for the SOL tokens, valuation methods, and risk disclosures. Workload and Priorities: The SEC handles numerous filings across various financial sectors. Delays can sometimes simply be a matter of managing a heavy workload and prioritizing reviews. What Does This Solana ETF Delay Mean for the Market? A Solana ETF delay introduces a period of uncertainty. While not an outright rejection, it pushes back the timeline for potential institutional investment and broader market access that an ETF could provide. Market reactions to such delays can vary, but often involve a temporary dip in asset price due to reduced immediate optimism, or simply sideways movement as participants await further clarity. For Solana specifically, the delay means the potential price catalyst of a spot ETF approval is now further out. Investors and traders who were anticipating a quick decision based on the pace of Bitcoin ETF approvals will need to adjust their expectations. The focus now shifts back to Solana’s fundamentals, network development, and the broader crypto market sentiment while the regulatory process unfolds. This situation also highlights the ongoing challenges in crypto ETF regulation . Each new asset class presents unique questions for regulators, and the path to mainstream financial products like ETFs is often slow and deliberate. The outcome of the SEC Solana ETF decision will be closely watched not just for Solana, but for its implications for other altcoins seeking similar investment vehicles. Challenges and Opportunities in Crypto ETF Regulation The regulatory path for crypto ETFs is fraught with challenges. The SEC has historically expressed concerns about market volatility, potential for manipulation, and investor protection in the crypto space. While the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs marked a significant turning point, it doesn’t automatically pave the way for all other cryptocurrencies. Challenges: Establishing robust surveillance mechanisms for diverse crypto markets. Determining which assets meet the SEC’s criteria for being suitable for a spot ETF. Addressing custody and security risks associated with holding various digital assets. Navigating the evolving legal and regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies globally. Opportunities: Increased clarity from regulatory bodies can foster innovation and investment. Approved ETFs can provide safer, more familiar investment avenues for a wider audience. The process pushes for greater maturity and transparency in crypto markets. Successful frameworks for one asset can potentially be adapted for others. The SEC decision delay on the Grayscale Solana ETF is a clear indicator that the regulatory journey for altcoin ETFs is far from over and will likely involve careful, step-by-step evaluations. Actionable Insights for Investors Given the uncertainty introduced by the Solana ETF delay , what should investors consider? Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on official announcements from the SEC and updates from Grayscale. The reasons for the delay and the new deadline will provide crucial context. Focus on Fundamentals: While regulatory news impacts price, the long-term value of Solana depends on its technology, adoption, developer activity, and ecosystem growth. Evaluate these factors independently of ETF speculation. Manage Expectations: Understand that the path to a Spot Solana ETF approval may be lengthy and involve further delays or even potential rejection. Don’t base investment decisions solely on the assumption of imminent ETF approval. Consider Diversification: Don’t place all your bets on a single asset or a single catalyst like an ETF approval. Diversify your crypto holdings based on your risk tolerance and research. Understand Regulatory Risk: Recognize that regulatory decisions, including those related to crypto ETF regulation , are a significant factor influencing the crypto market. The SEC decision delay is part of the standard regulatory process, but it underscores the ongoing scrutiny faced by the crypto industry as it seeks to integrate with traditional finance. Conclusion: A Waiting Game Continues The SEC’s decision to delay its ruling on the Grayscale Solana ETF application extends the period of anticipation for the Solana community and the broader crypto market. While not a definitive setback, it highlights the regulatory hurdles that remain for cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum seeking mainstream investment products like spot ETFs. The reasons behind the SEC decision delay likely revolve around a thorough examination of the Solana market’s structure, potential for manipulation, and the implications of setting a precedent for altcoin ETFs under existing crypto ETF regulation . The outcome of this review will be a critical moment for Solana and will provide further insight into the SEC’s approach to regulating the evolving digital asset landscape. For now, it’s a waiting game. The market will continue to operate based on existing factors, with the potential boost from a spot Solana ETF pushed further into the future. The focus remains on fundamental developments within the Solana ecosystem and the ongoing dialogue between innovators like Grayscale and regulators like the SEC.

This capital infusion marks one of the strongest waves of professional crypto adoption seen in recent quarters. The trend signals rising confidence among institutional buyers in the long-term value of digital assets, suggesting renewed momentum in both price performance and network fundamentals.While many established tokens have surged in value amid this backdrop, emerging platforms like Qubetics ($TICS) are gaining traction for a different reason. Unlike earlier projects that faced technical limitations, Qubetics is purpose-built for scalable, enterprise-grade utility. Its architecture addresses the operational challenges businesses and professionals face in cross-border communications, privacy, and finance. This is why Qubetics has rapidly become one of the best crypto to buy right now , alongside breakout performers like SUI and Cosmos (ATOM). Much of this fresh capital has flowed into projects with proven utility and high scalability potential. Participants are targeting ecosystems that can solve real-world problems, rather than speculative tokens with short-term hype. This changing capital behavior mirrors the maturation of the asset class—where interoperability, infrastructure, and enterprise adoption are now top considerations. Qubetics ($TICS): A Decentralized VPN and Scalable Infrastructure for Professionals Qubetics is transforming how digital privacy, global business operations, and decentralized communication are handled at scale. At the heart of its offering lies a Decentralized VPN designed to serve individuals, startups, and enterprise clients alike. This secure networking solution eliminates centralized choke points and intermediaries—allowing users to exchange information and assets in real time, across borders, with full sovereignty over their data. For businesses and professionals navigating a fragmented digital landscape, the Qubetics VPN provides low-latency performance, jurisdiction-agnostic access, and unmatched reliability. Whether it’s remote legal teams transferring contracts, cross-border payment processing, or data-sensitive collaboration between institutions, Qubetics addresses the trust gap that still hinders digital transformation globally. Beyond secure connectivity, Qubetics enables seamless integration of tokenized assets and digital services through its advanced interoperability layer. The platform’s architecture supports high throughput, low transaction costs, and customizable governance—key traits for builders and backers seeking future-ready blockchain infrastructure. Qubetics Presale Highlights and ROI Opportunity The Qubetics crypto presale is now in its 34th stage, having already sold more than 512 million tokens to a community of 26,300+ holders. Over $16.9 million has been raised so far, and $TICS tokens are priced at $0.2532 in the current round. For those who act now, entry remains viable with significant upside still in play. Early adopters from Stage 1—who secured $TICS at just $0.01—are now seeing a 2,432% return. Yet participants entering today can still secure an impressive 294% ROI if $TICS hits $1 after the presale. At $5, returns jump to 1,874%, while $6 yields 2,269%. If the token reaches $10 post-mainnet, community members could realize 3,848% gains. Should it soar to $15, the potential ROI hits an exceptional 5,822%. The presale is ongoing, and access remains open. For those seeking the best crypto to buy right now with actual enterprise application, Qubetics is a front-runner with a practical edge. SUI: Breaking Into the Top 11 with High-Volume Momentum SUI has made headlines by climbing to $4.15, marking its highest valuation since January and representing a staggering 1,040% gain from its 2024 low. This ascent has propelled SUI into the top 11 cryptocurrencies, ahead of well-known names like Chainlink, Avalanche, Stellar, and Hedera. From a technical standpoint, SUI is in the final phase of an Elliott Wave impulse pattern, indicating that the current rally could either top out soon or extend further—especially if market euphoria intensifies. The next resistance level to monitor is the all-time high at $5.33. A confirmed move above this threshold could attract widespread attention, especially from retail participants and trading platforms. SUI’s bullish case is supported by strong fundamentals, rapid transaction speeds, and increased developer interest. It is becoming an infrastructure-layer candidate for gaming, tokenization, and consumer Web3 use cases. SUI’s position as one of the best crypto to buy right now is supported by both price strength and its strategic positioning in digital scalability. With momentum intact and bullish chart formations in play, SUI offers breakout potential in the current cycle. Cosmos (ATOM): Interoperability Champion Regains Market Relevance Cosmos is one of the most technically advanced interoperability platforms on the market. As of mid-May 2025, ATOM is trading at $5.09, supported by a $1.99 billion market cap. With a circulating supply of 390.9 million tokens, Cosmos continues to serve as the foundation for interchain communication and modular blockchain design. Its key innovation, the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, allows independent blockchains to exchange data and value in a trustless manner. Cosmos also offers a developer-friendly toolkit for building sovereign, application-specific blockchains that plug into a broader ecosystem. This makes it ideal for scaling decentralized finance, gaming, and cross-chain governance solutions. ATOM has gained 19.42% in the past 30 days, signaling renewed attention from both retail buyers and institutional participants. As Web3 ecosystems demand better composability and scalability, Cosmos stands out as a core infrastructure player with staying power. Cosmos delivers real-world interoperability at scale, backed by consistent network growth. Its modular architecture makes it one of the best crypto to buy right now for those prioritizing multichain futures and blockchain composability. Final Thoughts The injection of $882 million in institutional capital has changed the tempo of the market. Rather than chasing speculative trends, professional buyers are locking into platforms that show scalability, usability, and long-term real-world alignment. Qubetics leads this new wave by merging decentralized infrastructure with practical tools like VPN access, cross-border transactions, and enterprise integrations. SUI has entered the high-cap league with parabolic growth backed by structured patterns and fundamental support. Cosmos reinforces its value through cross-chain communication and network modularity. Each project offers a unique entry point based on its current market positioning and adoption curve. But access is not infinite. With the Qubetics presale still live and rapidly advancing, now is a strategic time to engage with platforms that are building blockchain’s future—not just chasing its past.

For many, that regret is all too real. From DOGE to SHIB, early backers turned a few hundred bucks into life-changing wealth. But here’s the kicker: the next tidal wave is already swelling. Meme coins are resurging—faster, funnier, and fiercer than ever. In the middle of this storm stands BTFD Coin (BTFD) , a blazing-hot new project with a presale that’s igniting serious whale interest. With less than 15 days left until the presale ends on May 26, and analysts throwing around a bold $0.006 moon prediction, investors are scrambling to grab their stake before the window slams shut. This article explores the best meme coins to invest in now, featuring BTFD front and center alongside viral meme contenders that still have fuel in the tank. Let’s dive in while there’s still time to act. 1. BTFD Coin (BTFD) — The Final Dip Before 8900% Liftoff?

Sitting in Stage 15 of its presale at just $0.0002, BTFD is handing out presale deals that are hard to ignore. Over $6.81 million has already been raised. More than 73 billion tokens have been sold to 12,100+ holders. And there’s only one stage left before the explosive May 27 launch. Investors dropping $4500 at this stage grab 22.5 million $BTFD tokens. Apply the LAUNCH200 code , and those tokens triple to 67.5 million. If BTFD hits its projected listing price of $0.0006, that $4500 becomes $40,500. If it moons to $0.006 as predicted? You’re staring at over $400K. But here’s where it gets juicier: staking rewards are live with a 90% APY, and the Bulls Squad P2E game is fully playable—letting users earn as they play. And the hype isn’t just retail-driven. Big buys are starting to flood in. With meme coin whales joining the herd, the BTFD presale is shifting into high gear. This meme coin presale isn’t just another gamble—it’s the best-priced ticket into a bullish ecosystem that rewards early adopters with real utility, community, and monster returns. Why is BTFD among the best meme coins to invest in now? Because it’s one of the only coins giving investors triple tokens, staking rewards, and an 8900% ROI target—and it’s almost over. 2. Floki Inu (FLOKI) — The Viking of Hype Floki Inu continues to ride high on branding, community loyalty, and major marketing pushes. The team has invested heavily in partnerships and ecosystem development, from DeFi to metaverse integrations. It’s seen renewed interest thanks to increased token burns and bullish sentiment on DEXs.

Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) — Divine Degens Unite GOAT is the cult-favorite that mixes divine meme lore with on-chain chaos. Their recent campaign, “Sacrifice for Gains,” brought massive user traction. A quirky staking dashboard and comic-style roadmap give it that degen charm investors can’t ignore. Why did GOAT earn a spot? Because it’s weird, wild, and weirdly winning in all the right communities. 5. Brett (BRETT) — Still Got It Based on the Chad meme, BRETT offers a blend of alpha-male memetics and solid tokenomics. It made headlines after a recent DeFi bridge launch, increasing its on-chain usability. Despite volatility, the Brett Army remains loyal—and loud. Why is Brett here? Because in this market, recognizable memes with loyal fans stay relevant longer. 6. WHY (WHY) — Existential Goldmine WHY takes a nihilistic spin on meme investing. Its whitepaper is just “WHY NOT?” and that’s the joke—but the project has smart contract security and quirky NFT missions that keep its audience hooked. It’s proof that humor and hype still drive volume. Why did WHY make this list of the best meme coins to invest in now? Because sometimes nonsense makes more sense in meme coin season.

At the time of writing, BTC trades at $104,271, narrowing the gap to its all-time high of $109,000. This recent price surge is not occurring in isolation. Instead, it appears closely tied to broader macroeconomic developments, most notably, the recent easing of trade tensions between the US and China, with both countries reducing tariffs on certain imports and exports. Market participants have responded positively to these policy shifts, signaling renewed risk appetite across traditional and digital asset markets. Bitcoin’s rally over the weekend reflects this optimism, with analysts identifying key technical indicators pointing toward rising buyer strength. One such indicator, the Taker Buy Sell Ratio, is gaining attention for marking previous turning points in Bitcoin’s price history. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears All-Time High as $312M BTC Exit Binance Following US-China Trade Deal Bitcoin Taker Buy-Sell Ratio Signals Renewed Bullish Control CryptoQuant contributor G a a h highlighted that the Taker Buy Sell Ratio, a metric measuring the ratio of market buy orders to sell orders, has climbed to a significant threshold of 1.02. Historically, similar levels have coincided with crucial inflection points in Bitcoin’s price movement. For instance, this metric reached comparable highs during the late 2022 lows between $15,000 and $20,000, and again in October 2023 as Bitcoin broke through the $30,000 resistance level. According to G a a h, this recent breakout above the 1.00 line reflects an increase in aggressive buying activity, with market takers once again asserting short-term control. This suggests upward momentum may persist in the near term. However, the analyst also cautioned that these same conditions have previously been followed by volatility spikes, marking both the start and reversal of market trends. The analyst wrote: It’s worth noting that in previous periods, this same level has coincided with reversal zones or strong volatility, marking both the start and end of trends. We are therefore facing a scenario where buyer appetite could continue to drive BTC towards new highs. Realized Price Trends Confirm Ongoing Market Strength In a separate analysis, CryptoQuant analyst Crypto Dan examined Bitcoin’s realized price, a metric that reflects the average purchase price of all circulating BTC, as a tool to gauge market sentiment and directional strength. According to the report, the realized price is still on the rise, indicating that investors are increasingly accumulating BTC at higher prices. This trend differs significantly from previous cycles, where a reversal in the realized price preceded steep corrections. Crypto Dan attributes the current rise to institutional inflows, particularly through spot Bitcoin ETFs and corporate balance sheet purchases. These channels have brought in sustained capital, elevating the average acquisition price and reinforcing market structure. Related Reading: Why The US-China 90-Day Tariff Slash Can Push Bitcoin Price Above $110,000 As institutional players continue to allocate capital into Bitcoin, the realized price trend suggests that the ongoing rally may have more room to extend.

Analyst EGRAG CRYPTO says BTC closing above $109K is crucial for next bullish impulsive wave. Institutional interest in Bitcoin grows while retail is lukewarm; BTC dominance key to watch. Bitcoin (BTC) has once again surged past the six-figure mark, decisively crossing the $100,000 threshold with strong market momentum. As of press time, Bitcoin trades at $103,655 , reflecting nearly a 10% gain over the past week. A key aspect of this Bitcoin price $100k sustainable rally is that it comes without the usual signs of frothiness in the derivatives market. This, according to K33 Research, could signal a more sustainable rally this time around. Bitcoin has reclaimed six digits following continued strong momentum.

44593473,https://thecoinrise.com/is-web3bay-the-shopping-focused-crypto-platform-set-to-make-waves/,1747191616,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecoinrise.png,Is Web3Bay the Shopping-Focused Crypto Platform Set to Make Waves?,https://thecoinrise.com/is-web3bay-the-shopping-focused-crypto-platform-set-to-make-waves/,"In a market where price hype often wins attention, Web3Bay is quietly building a strong case by focusing on everyday shopping. While many crypto projects chase quick gains, Web3Bay is using its 3BAY coin to reward real activity, offering lasting value that few early-stage projects deliver. The idea is simple. Buyers who shop using 3BAY get an instant 5 percent discount. But the rewards do not end there. Buyers also earn daily bonuses, access special product drops, and help guide the platform’s future through governance rights. In short, every transaction becomes a chance to earn and participate, not just buy. The numbers back up this interest. Web3Bay has raised over 2 million dollars in its presale with more than 400 million coins sold at the current Stage 5 price of $0.005247. The final presale stage is set at $0.1959, offering those who join early the chance for a return of up to 6,400%. Unlike projects that only talk about future utility, Web3Bay is already live with a working marketplace. Real Benefits, Daily Earnings, True Platform Access Cashback rewards are common in traditional banking and shopping platforms, often offering 1 to 2 percent in points or restricted bonuses. Web3Bay offers something different. It gives users real, usable digital rewards for each purchase. Here’s the process. Buyers using 3BAY instantly get a 5 percent discount. In addition, Web3Bay provides ongoing daily rewards, building a cycle that encourages regular use. These rewards can be used within the platform, traded, or saved. What makes this model stand out is the added layer of community participation. Those holding 3BAY also gain the ability to vote on platform updates and new features. It gives every buyer the chance to help shape how the marketplace grows. This mix of savings, daily rewards, and shared control turns 3BAY into more than just a purchase method. It becomes a key part of the platform’s structure. That is what gives it lasting value in the fast-moving world of crypto. Why Web3Bay Is Gaining Attention Fast Web3Bay is solving a simple but overlooked fact: people shop in every market condition, whether prices are rising or falling. E-commerce remains one of the most stable industries, and connecting it to blockchain creates a huge new opportunity. Web3Bay does not try to change how people shop. Instead, it makes shopping more rewarding and allows users to take part in building a growing marketplace. What separates Web3Bay from other presale projects is that its platform is already live. It is not just a plan for the future but a real marketplace in action. Built on blockchain, it uses smart contract-based escrow and decentralized file storage through IPFS. It also works smoothly with crypto wallets and regular payment methods like PayPal, Google Pay, and Apple Pay. Web3Bay blends the ease of Web2 with the ownership model of Web3. This design helps attract both crypto users and everyday shoppers. Newcomers can start easily, and experienced users stay in control of their transactions. The system is built to grow, and it rewards those who take part early rather than only big companies or outside backers. Why Web3Bay Could Lead in Utility-Driven Crypto More people in crypto are shifting from trading for quick profits to using platforms that offer real benefits. Web3Bay aims to be a leader in this move toward useful crypto commerce. Projects like Ethereum and Solana grew because people built valuable products on them. Web3Bay follows the same path by tying 3BAY’s use to real shopping, active participation, and community decision-making. Those joining the presale now are not only hoping for future value. They are already joining a working system where 3BAY has a clear purpose today. The total supply is limited to 5 billion coins, and only 40 percent is set aside for crypto presale participants. The fixed supply and growing activity are starting to create demand. Web3Bay is not chasing trends or trying to be another meme coin. It aims to change online retail. It gives users a way to spend less, earn rewards, and have a say in how the platform grows. As presale stages move forward and prices rise, early participants in 3BAY may see themselves holding more than just a coin. They could be holding a role in shaping the future of online commerce.

Bitcoin holds steady, Ethereum keeps expanding, and focus is now shifting toward the next wave of standout players. Among the coins attracting attention are Solana, XRP, and Cardano, each showing renewed price action, solid patterns, and interest from institutions. But it’s BlockDAG that’s emerging as a serious contender. With its presale figures and scalable design, BDAG is drawing attention for its future potential. In a market looking for the next big mover, BlockDAG has become a name worth watching. Whether you’re a market veteran or just starting out, 2025 could be shaped by new leaders, and these four coins are top contenders. Let’s explore what makes each of these projects one of the top cryptos to watch this year. BlockDAG: 2520% Gain Potential BlockDAG has captured major attention in 2025. The project has now raised over $240.5 million and sold more than 20.1 billion BDAG coins, making it one of the most successful presales this year. Batch 28 is priced at $0.0262 with the launch price set at $0.05, that’s a projected gain of 2,520%. But BlockDAG ’s appeal goes beyond price. It supports EVM-compatible smart contracts and delivers fast transaction speeds. The project is developer-friendly and has already completed its CertiK audit. There are also signs of upcoming listings and strong interest from key players. Adoption is growing fast. The X1 Miner App has crossed one million downloads, and over 17,440 miner devices have been sold, pushing total miner sales beyond $7 million. These figures show that BlockDAG has traction beyond just early buzz. If you’re scanning the market for top cryptos to watch, BDAG offers one of the few opportunities with both a strong foundation and major growth upside, if you act now. Solana: Ecosystem Expansion Keeps SOL in the Lead Solana continues to perform well in 2025, now trading around $175.15 after a 0.40% daily increase. Over the past month, it’s up 36%, boosted by high trading activity and renewed institutional attention. The $150 mark has become a reliable support level. Analysts say if the upward trend holds, Solana could move toward $164 – $200 in the coming weeks. The chain’s strong throughput, low fees, and growing user base make it one of the top cryptos to watch this year. From DeFi projects to NFT activity, the network is staying active. Solana’s steady development and expanding utility ensure it keeps its place as a key player in the market’s next phase. For those watching the space, SOL remains a project to track closely. XRP: Legal Progress and Whale Interest Drive Sentiment XRP is making headlines again, priced at $2.46 and up 3.67% in 24 hours. Its daily volume has jumped above $4.35 billion. A rise in whale wallet activity and progress in Ripple’s legal situation are pushing the narrative. Analysts see $6.30 as a possible target if a favorable legal outcome is confirmed. That would clear a path for wider adoption. XRP recently broke past key resistance, a positive sign amid broader uncertainty. As a project focused on cross-border payments, XRP has a real use case. The combination of legal clarity and growing interest makes it one of the top cryptos to watch. The next few months may define its long-term place in the market. Cardano: Closing in on Key Resistance Levels Cardano (ADA) is showing upward momentum, with a current price of $0.8314 after a 4.02% gain in a day. It’s nearing an important resistance zone between $0.70 and $0.80. A breakout here could point to a run toward $1, a strong technical and psychological level. A descending triangle breakout and increased whale wallet activity suggest growing interest. Market sentiment also supports ADA’s path upward. Cardano’s strong focus on academic research and sustainability makes it stand out in the race for scalable blockchain networks. It has earned its spot among the top cryptos to watch for 2025, especially as it hits new milestones. Final Thoughts: The 2025 Crypto Picture Is Taking Shape The next wave of crypto leaders is starting to emerge. Solana has momentum, XRP is benefiting from legal shifts, and Cardano continues to deliver consistent updates. Each holds promise in its own way. But BlockDAG may offer the most striking opportunity. With its current price of $0.0262 available in batch 28, and strong traction across miners and users, it’s a project with real breakout potential. As the market gears up for its next move, these names will likely dominate the conversation around top cryptos to watch in 2025. The post Missed Bitcoin?

Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are back in focus, with rising whale activity, technical patterns, and community chatter. While both tokens attract fresh interest, another name is quietly picking up pace. Dragoin ($DDGN) has entered Stage 4 of its presale and is offering more than just hype. It brings live gameplay, immediate rewards, and a 6,700 percent return that is already set within its price tiers. Below is a closer look at the latest Shiba Inu and Dogecoin movements and why Dragoin might offer something different in 2025. Shiba Inu Gains Attention After Fake Token Alert The Shiba Inu team has issued a warning about fake SHIB tokens being shared on various platforms. They clarified that these tokens are not connected to any official project within the ecosystem. Even though the warning was defensive, it brought more visibility to SHIB. The token name started trending online again, and the community responded by highlighting the legitimacy of the original project. Developer activity has also remained steady, with Shibarium continuing to expand as part of the long-term Layer 2 plans. However, SHIB’s price has not moved much. It remains in a sideways trend, with long-term supporters staying hopeful but short-term action still limited. Dogecoin Whale Moves Hint at Possible Upside Dogecoin has shown new bullish signals backed by data. Whale accumulation has been noted by analysts at TronWeekly, a pattern that has in the past led to major price moves. The Dogecoin Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently in a neutral zone, which could support further price increases without risk of being overbought. Resistance levels at $0.16661 and $0.18028 are now being watched closely. If DOGE can pass these marks, some analysts expect the rally to gain speed. DOGE is picking up momentum. Buying interest is rising. But for new buyers coming in now, any gains will depend on whether the broader market pushes it back to old highs. That’s where Dragoin offers a different angle. It has value baked in through its price model, and its tools are already live. Dragoin ($DDGN) Combines Playable Utility With Meme Appeal Dragoin is not following the usual meme coin formula seen with DOGE or SHIB. It is setting up a different approach, offering one of the most original models in the meme coin category. This project starts with a working game. Right now, users can enter a live Telegram-based play-to-earn game where they manage dragons, complete tasks, and earn leaderboard rewards. There is no extra app to install. Players simply log in and start earning by staying active. The presale model is designed to be easy to follow and capable of handling scale. Running through 25 price stages, Dragoin is currently in Stage 4, with tokens priced at $0.0000444. The launch price is already confirmed at $0.002. This gives a simple, upfront return calculation. Early participants are buying at a level that offers 6,700% potential returns at the time of launch. Community activity is also central to this project. From the beginning, Dragoin has made open access and involvement a priority. Events, bonuses, and airdrops are not just for attention. They are part of how the project creates value. The idea is simple: users join, earn, and help guide the direction. This is not a project asking people to wait. It encourages them to take part. The numbers behind Dragoin’s possible upside are clear. At Stage 4, $1,000 gives around 29.85 million tokens. At launch, if listed at $0.002, that holding could be worth $67,000. That is a 6,700% increase built into the early sale. This does not include possible gains from gameplay, bonus rewards, or price action after the token lists. Clear Supply Design and Decentralized Control Dragoin’s total token supply is fixed at 200 billion. Half of that supply is allocated to the presale, letting more buyers enter early at a lower cost. Another 30% will go toward growing the ecosystem through in-game rewards, future development, and staking support. The next 15% is for liquidity, helping trading stay stable after launch. The last 5% is reserved for the team but locked for two years, showing long-term interest and preventing early exits. A key decision in Dragoin’s design is that all unsold tokens from the crypto presale will be permanently burned. This instantly reduces the supply and may increase the value of what remains. In addition, the smart contract will be renounced at launch, taking all control away from the developers and making the project fully decentralized. These steps are not just features. They are built into the structure and show Dragoin’s focus on transparency and stability. A Closer Look at Three Meme Coins Comparing SHIB, DOGE, and Dragoin shows three very different types of projects. Shiba Inu is facing false token issues and building its ecosystem slowly. Dogecoin has some positive signs, but most interest depends on large holders and community reactions. Dragoin, on the other hand, already has a working game, real-time rewards, and a defined return path with a decentralized setup in motion. People who are holding SHIB or DOGE may feel they are making a stable choice. But higher returns rarely come with complete safety. If you are someone who missed early chances in DOGE or SHIB, Dragoin is now offering an entry that matches those earlier prices, but with added features and a working product. With Stage 4 still active, the lower prices are available now. Later stages may not give the same starting point.

In this article, we’ll break down the recent price action, what could happen next, and a long-term prediction for Cardano’s future. Cardano Breaks a New High After Months For the first time since December, Cardano’s price broke out of its downward trend. Recently, it reached as high as $0.86 before pulling back slightly. This move was important because it could mean a possible shift from a bearish (downward) market to a bullish (upward) trend. At the moment, Cardano has strong support levels around $0.77 to $0.72. There’s a chance the price could revisit these levels before starting another push higher. Can ADA Reach $2 or More This Bull Market? According to Investing Broz, by the end of summer, Cardano could aim for new highs between $1.70 and $2.40. But what about the top of this entire bull market? To figure that out, it’s important to consider a few important factors: how much ADA will be in circulation, how much of the total crypto market Cardano will control, and what the overall crypto market cap might be. When Will the Bull Market Peak? Predicting the exact timing of a bull market top is tough. Some believe it could follow the classic four-year cycle and peak around September or October 2025. However, recent trends suggest this cycle might not hold up anymore. The crypto market has changed, with big institutions playing a larger role now. Unlike retail investors, institutions often use market manipulation tactics, causing unexpected price movements. Because of this, the top of the bull market could come earlier or later than expected. A safe guess would be around mid-2026, when more institutional money might flow into the market. How Much ADA Will Be in Circulation? Right now, there are about 35.3 billion ADA tokens in circulation. By the summer of 2026, this number is expected to rise to around 36.5 billion. This gradual increase will slightly affect the price as more tokens become available. How Much of the Crypto Market Will Cardano Control? At the moment, Cardano holds about 0.88% of the total crypto market. In previous bull markets, its dominance was higher. However, with more competition in the market today, it’s unlikely to reclaim those old levels. A reasonable expectation for Cardano’s dominance would be between 2% and 4% by the peak of the bull market. While some believe it could go higher, the growing number of altcoins makes this range a realistic target. Cardano’s Possible Market Cap and Price If the total crypto market reaches $11 trillion and Cardano holds between 2% and 4% dominance, its market cap could range from $220 billion to $440 billion. Based on these market cap numbers and the expected 36.5 billion ADA tokens in circulation, Cardano’s price could land between $6 and $12 during the peak of the bull market. In a very bullish scenario, where the total market reaches $22 trillion, Cardano’s market cap could climb as high as $880 billion.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-14 03:03:24

Here’s Why Lightchain AI Could Be Your Next Big Win,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/is-the-bear-market-crushing-portfolios-heres-why-lightchain-ai-could-be-your-next-big-win/,"In a market that has been dominated by the bears, Lightchain AI is offering investors a path of escape. Its presale has hit $20.2 million, with tokens selling at $0.007, making the project one of the best ways for investors to turn their fortunes around in this market cycle. While many coins have been battling the bears, Lightchain AI continues its impressive rise, thanks to its great vision and practical value. As the wider market continues to drop, those looking for hedges are turning to projects that have a real staying power, making Lightchain AI one of the most promising in that aspect. Why Is Bear Market Devastating Crypto Portfolios? The ongoing crypto winter has been hurting portfolios, with the effect worsened by macroeconomic and sector factors. Rising interest rates and other monetary policies have also removed liquidity in the system, leading to investors leaving riskier classes of assets like cryptocurrencies. In addition, projects like FTX have also reduced investor confidence, leading to sharp selloffs. Moreover, there has been increased regulatory attention and enforcement, leading to an increase in the uncertainty in the market, causing investors to be cautious. Also, fast money movements, which is down to the quick inflows and outflows of money (primarily institutional investors via ETFs) have caused volatility in the market. These factors combined and caused the market to witness a downturn, showing the importance of risk management practices and diversification of assets in the crypto industry. Nevertheless, there is always a ray of hope that shines in these times. As short-term traders attempt to make their way during these volatile periods, it has provided an opportunity for long-term investors to increase their portfolios. One of the projects that can be used to achieve this is Lightchain AI, a project that is worth being invested in. Why Lightchain AI is Poised for Significant Growth Unlike speculative meme coins or projects that depend on hype, Lightchain AI stands out in the crypto industry, addressing the major challenges in the blockchain and AI industry and providing real value. One of its most impressive features is its cryptographic verification system, which ensures that only legitimate updates are added to the blockchain. This ensures that users can feel secure and trust the network, showing that the project is focused on real change rather than empty promises. Lightchain AI is a project that promises real application and has a strong growth potential. Another highlight is its Memecoin Launchpad, which was designed to help creators and developers. It has different AI-powered tools that help creators bring their ideas to life, ensuring that they earn well. It is all about improving creativity and aiding the development of the new generation of blockchain ecosystems. Why Lightchain AI is Turning Heads, Even in Bear Market The crypto industry might be facing its challenges, Lightchain AI is still drawing attention, and it’s for the right reasons. The AI industry is on the rise, and the project is leading that charge in combining AI and blockchain technology. Even in tough market conditions, the project still raised $20.2 million in its presale. That kind of confidence from investors is not just luck, it is a sign that Lightchain AI is ready for something big as the market prepares to bounce back. What really sets Lightchain AI apart? It provides investors with the perfect time to het into the project. With tokens still selling for $0.007, this is the perfect opportunity for investors to enter, positioning themselves for profits when the token starts to rise after the launch. As crypto begins to recover, Lightchain AI stands out as a project that wants to change things. It has a bold vision and a rising demand that make it more than just the next project, making it an investment that has real promise. Opportunities like this are hard to find, so it might be the best opportunity to take a look at the project. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf Tweets by LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",Press Release,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-14 03:11:52

As furore about U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs rages on, one age-old reality remains constant for the Japanese: gold is valuable. Regional media in Japan reports that gold is being adopted more and more as a safe haven against looming economic threats.Kyodo News recently detailed that Japanese investors are turning to the shiny yellow metal via the government’s controversial new NISA (Nippon Individual Savings Account), as well as through solid, direct investment. Japan residents take shelter in gold via NISA, direct investment NISA’s tax-exemption schemes for private investors afford individuals the ability to invest in products linked to gold’s price movements, but direct investments are also reportedly on the rise.Tanaka Precious Metal Technologies, Co. notes of the inter-dealer price (translated): “[The] price was also boosted by reports that US President Trump was considering firing Fed Chairman Powell, reaching a monthly high of 15,561 yen on the 22nd. After that, US President Trump denied the idea of ​​firing the Fed Chairman, and selling prevailed due to expectations of an easing of US-China trade friction, and the month ended at 15,198 yen.” JPY-denominated Tanaka Precious Metals retail bullion price. Source: Tanaka . Notably, gold tapped an all-time JPY price high per gram on April 22, and again on May 8, according to the asset bullion retail rate set by Tanaka. The tax-excluded, inter-dealer reference price (mentioned above) similarly tapped a high on the 22nd, but has since cooled off.The Kyodo News report notes that concerns about global economic downturn and Donald Trump’s trade war have Tokyoites and residents of Japan not only buying up bullion and coins, but also “investing in pure gold at fixed monthly values” via Tanaka Precious Metals, which investments reportedly grew 26% as compared to the January-April period from a year ago.Further, Komehyo Co., a major secondhand luxury brand retailer, says gold product sales (including accessories) climbed 30% year-on-year as of March 2025.Investments such as the Mitsubishi UFJ fine gold fund (tied to gold’s price), have also seen growth, with inflows of “19.2 billion yen in March, up by about 2.6-fold from last December,” according to Kyodo. Japan’s political and economic strife a major factor Even before fear of Trump’s stifling of international exchange, Japan has been struggling with multiple issues, most of which have been the direct result of dysfunctional government policy. These issues include lack of adequate pensions for the elderly, skyrocketing inflation, rice prices at all-time highs , destructive inbound tourism, a new self-described “defense geek” prime minister with a strikingly low approval rating.Given the turmoil, people seem to be turning to gold in an ages old strategy designed to protect themselves from such problems. To many residents of the archipelago, Japan’s PM seems more interested in pouring JPY into the U.S. state , than helping fix the problems at hand.

The memo says revenue in the fiscal year that starts in July will fall 4% from the state’s earlier forecast. Staff members link the slide to a stock sell‑off that hit Wall Street after Trump set out a wide tariff push on April 2. The officials broke down the projected loss this way: about $10 billion less from capital‑gains taxes, $2.5 billion less from corporate taxes, and roughly $3.5 billion less from personal‑income taxes tied to wages and business profits. “Trump’s tariff policies weakened the national and state outlook and caused equity losses,” the memo says. Officials add that these factors began to drag on California receipts in 2025 and erased the strong cash flow the state had seen earlier in the year. Even so, revenue for the fiscal year that ends in June still stands $6.8 billion above Newsom’s last estimate. On the same day the memo came out, a rally led by technology firms pushed U.S. stocks into positive territory for the year. Washington and Beijing said on Monday they will temporarily lower duties on each other’s goods, another sign that could boost investor mood. Newsom calls the gap “Trump Slump” Politico first reported on the memo, which lands one day before the governor is due to unveil his new budget proposal for the coming fiscal year. California’s budget is dependent on the richest households. The top 1% of earners pay nearly half of all personal‑income tax, and much of that money hinges on capital‑gains income that follows the stock market. The new hit to the treasury comes on top of $27.3 billion in financial remedies. It includes $16.1 billion in cuts and a $7.1 billion removal from the state’s rainy‑day fund. California’s constitution requires a balanced budget each year, which means that any shortfall must be closed. Hence, this will be the third year in a row that Newsom and lawmakers trim spending after earlier budgets allocated more money than the state can spend on various programs. Trump’s April tariff order placed duties on all imported goods, raised taxes on items from Mexico, Canada and China, and set extra levies on products such as cars and aluminum. While the president has since eased some of those tariffs, Newsom argues that the policy and the uncertainty around it will raise unemployment and inflation, lower gross domestic product and shrink capital‑gains revenue for California. Last month California sued Trump, saying that he lacks the authority to impose tariffs all on his own. On Tuesday, state attorneys said they will ask a federal judge for a preliminary injunction that would freeze the tariffs while the case moves forward.

This surge comes as tariff tensions between China and the United States ease off, and macroeconomic conditions become positive again. According to a report from the crypto exchange Bitfinex, favorable macroeconomic conditions and significant institutional demand can keep BTC on a positive trajectory in the meantime. Analysts said that with macro catalysts returning to the forefront, BTC will continue to display relative strength compared with equities and other risk assets. Bitcoin Reclaims $100K One development driving the confidence that has returned to the market is the Federal Reserve’s positive comments on the rate trajectory around the U.S. tariff situation. The comments’ positivity has created a backdrop that has strengthened bitcoin’s recovery and set the stage for a renewed push to new ATHs. Per Bitfinex analysts, China has paused retaliatory tariffs against the U.S., following “backchannel progress” between both countries. The market now faces reduced geopolitical tail risk and ongoing fiscal support, and with rate cuts still on the table, risk assets, led by BTC, could perform well. Bitcoin’s resurgence has triggered a fresh wave of capital inflows, reviving market liquidity and participation. Some investors are re-entering the market, while others are de-risking and taking profits. Bitfinex said the renewed capital inflow is evident in the realized cap. This metric measures the aggregate cost basis of all coins in circulation and tells how much capital enters the market over time. Bitcoin’s realized cap has hit an ATH of $889 billion, rising by 2.1% in the past 30 days. This indicates a sharp uptick in net inflows, reinforcing analysts’ belief that bitcoin’s recent gains are driven by fresh liquidity and not speculative rotation. While BTC hovered below the $75,000 range, more than 5 million coins were at an unrealized loss; however, the price recovery has reduced that number to 0.7 million. Institutional Demand Becomes Steady In addition to bitcoin’s realized cap hitting a new ATH, U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have recorded massive inflows in the last two weeks. Inflow patterns observed by analysts suggest that ETF flows are becoming de-correlated from short-term pullbacks. The demand signals steady allocation from market participants, not opportunistic buying, driven by portfolio mandates, not retail speculation.

However, various analysts forecast potential volatility for the King of Altcoins, as it faces some resistance at the current levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces Key Resistance After 10% Weekly Rally – Confirmation Or Rejection Next? Ethereum To Trade Sideways Before Next Jump After surging nearly 45% in the past week, Ethereum has reclaimed its $2,200-$3,900 macro range lost in March. During the late-April market pump, the cryptocurrency recovered from its 18-month low of $1,380, jumping toward the $1,800 resistance before breaking out last Thursday. ETH has smashed past the $2,000 resistance and regained the crucial $2,100 and $2,300 levels before retesting the $2,600 resistance over the weekend. Since then, the King of Altcoins has hovered between the $2,400-$2,600 price range, hitting a two-month high of $2,624 on Monday. Market watcher Castillo Trading highlighted that Ethereum is “doing exactly what it should be. Taking some time to build a base at important levels before the next move.” The analyst stated that the $2,400-$2,700 zone will likely be ETH’s trading range for the upcoming days after its retest of the range lows as support, with “some shakeouts in both directions before continuing its next leg up.” Similarly, Daan Crypto Trades noted that the cryptocurrency’s current level is important, as it could determine its short-term direction. According to the trader, Ethereum could drop to $2,300 or below the $2,100 support level if it loses the key area. “In that case, you can simply wait for a consolidation to be formed at those levels,” he explained. On the contrary, if ETH breaks past the $2,600 resistance, and price keeps surging, the current level may “become a nice retest of the horizontal.” Notably, the next crucial horizontal level sits around the $2,850-$2,900 range, a significant support and resistance area amid the Q3 2024 pullback and the Q4 2024 breakout. Is A Dip Or A 15% Shakeout Coming? Analyst Rekt Capital pointed out that Ethereum secured a key Weekly Close after closing the week at $2,514 and officially reclaiming its Macro Range. According to the analyst, history suggests that ETH will “likely lift across the Range” over time, while “any dips, if needed at all, would only solidify $2200 as Range Low support.” He stressed that the recent Weekly Close occurred at the top of a crucial cluster, enabling a scenario where “just a small dip would suffice, if the green circled retest repeats here at ~$2468 (black).” However, if that level is lost, ETH could see a 10%-15% pullback toward the $2,200-$2,100 mark. Rekt Capital also remarked that the second-largest crypto by market capitalization has managed to fill the $2,530-$2,630 Daily CME Gap, created in March. Related Reading: Why The US-China 90-Day Tariff Slash Can Push Bitcoin Price Above $110,000 Amid its breakout, ETH also formed two small CME Gaps at the $2,300-$2,400 and $2,100-$2,200 levels, which could be closed soon. The former is the “more important dipping area, as it is also a Weekly CME Gap.” Additionally, he affirmed that Ethereum intends to fill its Macro CME Gap, between $2,900 and $3,350, signaling that a surge toward those levels could be ahead. As of this writing, Ethereum trades at $2,597, a 5% increase in the daily timeframe.

This 20% one-week rise places it ahead of the broader cryptocurrency market, which has seen a 13% uptick over the same period. The surge in price has been matched by a sharp increase in derivatives activity. In just one week, futures open interest for XRP ( XRP ) has increased from $2.42 billion to $3.42 billion, according to a May 13 post on X from Glassnode. This $1 billion spike, or a 41.6% rise, shows growing influx of capital and increased speculative activity, suggesting that traders are positioning for a major move. $XRP Futures Open Interest has surged by over $1B in the past week, rising from $2.42B to $3.42B (+41.6%). This sharp increase in leverage coincides with a price rally from $2.14 to $2.48, suggesting elevated speculative activity and growing directional conviction, pic.twitter.com/QbsaOM9oxE — glassnode (@glassnode) May 13, 2025 Open interest refers to the total number of active futures contracts that have not yet been settled. When open interest climbs alongside price, it typically reflects new money entering the market, rather than short-covering or position unwinding.

XRP price analysis. crypto.news At 68, the relative strength index is getting close to but not yet past the overbought zone, indicating that there is still potential for the current trend to continue. Other important indicators, like the moving average convergence divergence, point to continued upward movement. Alongside chart strength, institutional demand appears to be growing. The XXRP ETF, which provides institutional investors with exposure to XRP, has seen inflows for five weeks in a row. The fund brought in $14 million last week, up from $10 million the previous week, according to data from etf.com. The fund’s total assets under management now amount to over $99 million. This is notable considering that its 1.89% annual management fee is almost twice as high as some of the more well-known Bitcoin ( BTC ) ETFs. Despite this, investor interest is still high, suggesting that there is a greater demand for products linked to XRP. This rise in demand coincides with mounting speculation that spot XRP ETFs will soon be approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Platforms like Polymarket now show that the odds of approval are 80%. According to JPMorgan analysts, XRP ETF inflows could reach $8 billion in the first year, surpassing Ethereum ( ETH ) ETF inflows since their approval in September 2024. Because of its strong technical structure, growing institutional interest, and rising open interest, XRP looks ready for a significant breakout if the current trends continue.

It dipped below $1,800 just days ago and is now pushing toward the $2,700 mark. The retail investors who were once doubtful are now looking for the right moment to jump in. So what’s next for Ethereum? Santiment has recently shared some exciting insights on Ethereum’s comeback. Back in 2017, there was talk of Ethereum overtaking Bitcoin as the top crypto, thanks to its smart contracts and developer-friendly ecosystem. While that never happened, the debate over Ethereum’s potential to outshine Bitcoin’s first-mover advantage is still alive. Abraxas Capital bought another 33,482 $ETH ($84.7M) in the past 12 hours, bringing their total purchases over the last 6 days to 211,030 $ETH ($477.6M). https://t.co/qZZkGndZEd pic.twitter.com/mOIdthyWUG — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) May 13, 2025 The social sentiment has also flipped fast. Right before this pump, the bears were in control, with many doubting Ethereum’s growth potential as other altcoins grabbed the spotlight. But as Ether got back on track, the doubters were silenced, with targets now calling for $3,500 or even higher. Transaction Fees Drop Another factor to watch is transaction fees. They’ve dropped to around $0.84 per transfer, much lower than the $7 range six months ago. But if the fees start climbing back to $2 or above, the rally could be at risk. Lookonchain data shows that Abraxas Capital recently bought 33,482 ETH worth about $84.7 million on May 13. The firm has accumulated over 211K ETH, worth around $477 million, in the past 6 days, playing a big role in the recent price surge.

Relief’s tweet references an older claim about a high price projection for XRP, based on a valuation model co-developed by Mitchnick during his time with Ripple. In the tweet, Remi Relief wrote, “XRP $4000. For those that don’t know who Robert Mitchnick is… look him up. Short summary. He use to work for Ripple and now works for BlackRock. Idk if he ‘left’ Ripple or was ‘sent’ to BR. IMO he was sent there.” This was in response to a tweet from another X account, who said , “Robert Mitchnick, previously worked at Ripple and now working at Blackrock, thinks XRP price target is $4,000.” XRP $4000 For those that don’t know who Robert Mitchnick is…look him up. Short summary. He use to work for Ripple and now works for BlackRock. Idk if he “left” Ripple or was “sent” to BR. IMO he was sent there. https://t.co/OqXN5VQfxG — The Real Remi Relief (@RemiReliefX) May 11, 2025 Attached to the second post is a screenshot of an article published in 2024. The article reported a valuation model developed by Stanford professor Susan Athey and Robert Mitchnick, which proposed a potential fair market value of $4,813 for XRP. Based on assumptions in the 2018 Athey-Mitchnick model, that projection has since resurfaced through the recent attention on social media. Breakdown of the Athey-Mitchnick Model The model in question evaluates XRP’s future price based on two primary assumptions: the asset’s use in global cross-border transactions and its function as a store of value. According to the analysis, the price could reach thousands of dollars per unit if XRP were to facilitate 10% of global transactions by 2030 and simultaneously capture 10% of global store-of-value demand. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 At the time of the model’s publishing, XRP was approximately $0.5281. The paper argued that XRP’s market performance had been hindered by external factors such as regulatory actions and price suppression. It proposed that under conditions of unrestricted utility, XRP could achieve significant valuation increases. The model assumed a daily transaction volume of $700 billion and a total demand for storing XRP of $53 trillion by 2030. It also applied a 10% discount rate to account for the time value of money. The projected fair market value of $4,813 took into consideration that escrowed XRP would remain locked, further limiting circulating supply and boosting price estimates. Relevance of Mitchnick’s Position at BlackRock Remi Relief’s tweet questions whether Mitchnick’s move from Ripple to BlackRock was voluntary or strategic. While there is no public confirmation on the nature of his transition, some in the community interpret it as significant, especially in light of BlackRock’s increasing involvement in digital asset markets. Relief did not claim direct confirmation of Mitchnick endorsing the $4,000 target but noted the connection between his prior modeling work and his current position at a leading financial institution. Although the original model did not account for all possible developments, such as the emergence of central bank digital currencies or other unforeseen innovations, it remains one of the more widely cited theoretical assessments of XRP’s long-term price potential. It emphasized the asset’s built-in scarcity and scalability benefits in global financial infrastructure. The resurfacing of this topic through Remi Relief and others brings renewed attention to a historical but influential valuation model that continues to inform sections of the XRP community’s expectations.

The platform and its backers sold over 11.92 million shares for $52 each, which are slated to start trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on May 14 under the ticker symbol ETOR, eToro said in a May 13 press release. Initially, the firm aimed to raise $500 million by offering 10 million shares priced between $46 to $50 each. The share offering will remain open until at least May 15 and consists of more than 5.9 million shares sold by eToro and 5.9 million shares sold by specific existing shareholders. The Israel-based eToro will go public as a rival to Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD), which went public in July 2021 and whose shares are up over 67% year to date, according to Google Finance. Robinhood closed May 13 trading up over 67% at $62 per share, nearing its all-time high of $65, which it hit in February. Source: Google Finance Initially, eToro made confidential filings with the SEC in January for a public offering before publicly announcing the plans on March 24. Digital banking fintech firm Chime has also applied to list its stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol CHY. However, the number of shares and price range are still to be determined. Investment advisory firm Renaissance Capital speculated in a May 13 note to its clients that Chime’s IPO could raise up to $1 billion. Crypto IPOs in the works Other crypto companies are also mulling plans to go public. Crypto exchange Kraken is reportedly considering a public offering this year. Stablecoin issuer Circle filed with the SEC on April 1, then paused its plans after President Donald Trump’s April 2 tariff announcements tanked global markets and stopped many in-the-works public offerings. Crypto custody services firm BitGo launched a global over-the-counter trading desk for digital assets in February, after it was reported to be gearing up for an initial public offering slated for later this year.

Its ups and downs over the past week are the slowest they’ve been in 563 days. When coins go this still, sharp climbs or big drops can often come next. So, what can people expect from BTC and other big coins like ETH, XRP, and ADA? Bitcoin (BTC): Nearing a key test Right now, Bitcoin is close to $95,000. However, here’s the big thing — its swings in price have slowed to their lowest in more than 500 days. That calm often means a storm could be on the way. If BTC climbs past $95K, it may soon push toward $100K. It could aim for as high as $107K if it breaks that point. Yet, if it can’t break through, it might fall back to the $90K zone or even near $85K. Dogecoin (DOGE): Still in its range DOGE is stuck between $0.14 and $0.21. That’s a tight space, and it’s been there for some time. If DOGE breaks past $0.21, that could set off a good rise to $0.28. However, if it falls below $0.14, it might drop back to $0.10. Many traders holding meme coins like DOGE often look at trends and price shifts before making a move, or even enjoy crypto games like Mine Island to pass the time as they wait for clear market signals. Ethereum (ETH): Could jump soon ETH is doing well, holding strong above $1,800. If it exceeds the $1,858 mark, people could see a good push up to $2,111. If it goes above that, ETH may then climb to $2,550. That would be a big deal, as it might end its slow spell. However, if ETH drops below key lines like its 20-day or 50-day moving spots, it may get stuck between $1,368 and $2,111 for some time. Ripple (XRP): At a crossroads XRP is in a tricky spot. It’s now below its trend lines, which is not a good sign for people who want to see it rise. It could hit the key line at $2 if it keeps falling. If it breaks that, it might drop to $1.61. Yet, if Ripple bounces back and climbs over its past high, XRP might get back on track and rise to $3. Cardano (ADA): Holding steady ADA is still above its main support lines, which is a good sign, but bulls must act soon. If this coin drops below those lines, it might fall to $0.58; if it breaks through $0.75, it could increase to $0.83. Chainlink (LINK): Needs to bounce LINK got close to $16 but couldn’t stay there. It dropped back to its safe zones — the moving averages. If LINK gets a good bounce here, it might try to break out again and surpass its trend line. However, it could go as low as $11.68 if it falls further. Avalanche (AVAX): Double-bottom chance AVAX is now at its safe price lines, which might pull in buyers. If it climbs from here, AVAX could form a ‘double-bottom’, a shape that often means the coin is set to rise. If that happens, it could go to $31.73, but if it drops below $19.68, it may stay stuck in a wide range between $15.27 and $23.50. Big moves may be next Bitcoin’s long calm spell may soon end — and with it, people could see a big move not just in BTC but in other top altcoins too. Some coins show signs of hope, while others hold at key spots. Like the Mine Island game, the crypto market can shift instantly, with steep climbs or sharp falls that test your timing. For traders and fans alike, staying sharp and watching the charts could be key in the days ahead.",Crypto News|Press Release|ALTCOINS|BITCOIN,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|BTC|DOGE|ETH,"{'name': 'Bitcoin World', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinworld,2025-05-14 04:59:03
44596330,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=160120,1747198833,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Legal AI Startup Harvey Makes Strategic AI Models Shift,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/harvey-legal-ai-shift/,"In the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence, where foundation models are the bedrock for innovation, a significant development has caught the attention of the tech community, including those interested in cryptocurrency applications leveraging AI. Harvey, a prominent player in the Legal AI space and notably backed by the OpenAI Startup Fund, has announced it will begin incorporating leading AI models from both Anthropic and Google. Why This AI Models Shift Matters This move, detailed in a recent Harvey blog post, goes beyond Harvey’s previous reliance solely on OpenAI models. While Harvey states it is not abandoning OpenAI’s technology but rather adding diversity, the integration of models from key competitors like Anthropic and Google represents a notable win for these companies in the competitive AI landscape. Harvey is a high-profile success story from the OpenAI Startup Fund’s early portfolio, having grown to a reported $3 billion valuation. The significance is amplified by Harvey’s history: Harvey was among the first four startups the OpenAI Startup Fund backed in late 2022. The company has seen rapid growth and secured substantial funding rounds. Interestingly, Google’s venture arm, GV, led Harvey’s Series C round, yet Harvey didn’t immediately adopt Google’s Google AI models until now. What Drove Harvey to Adopt New AI Models? The decision wasn’t arbitrary. Harvey developed an internal benchmark called ‘BigLaw’ to evaluate how different foundation models perform on various legal tasks. The results were compelling: A variety of models are becoming increasingly capable in legal applications. Specific models demonstrate particular strengths in different legal tasks. Within a year, multiple non-OpenAI models outperformed Harvey’s original benchmarked system. Instead of focusing resources on training its own models from scratch, Harvey concluded it was more efficient to leverage high-performing, general reasoning models from other vendors and fine-tune them specifically for the legal market. This includes accessing models from Anthropic and Google, sometimes via cloud providers like Amazon. Benchmarking Reveals Task-Specific Strengths Harvey’s BigLaw benchmark provided crucial insights into which AI models excel at what. For example, their testing indicated: Google AI ‘s Gemini 2.5 Pro shows strength in legal drafting. However, Gemini 2.5 Pro reportedly struggles with certain pre-trial tasks, like writing oral arguments, due to challenges understanding complex evidentiary rules such as hearsay. OpenAI’s models perform well on such pre-trial tasks. Anthropic ‘s Claude 3.7 Sonnet also performs strongly in these areas, following closely behind OpenAI’s performance in some pre-trial tasks. These findings underscore the reality that no single model is universally superior for all tasks, prompting the need for a multi-model strategy in specialized fields like Legal AI . Future Implications: AI Agents and Transparency Using a diverse set of AI models will also be beneficial as Harvey develops AI agents for legal workflows. Furthermore, Harvey plans to contribute to the broader AI community by sharing its BigLaw benchmark findings publicly. They intend to launch a public leaderboard ranking major reasoning models on legal tasks. This leaderboard won’t just rely on single scores but will also incorporate qualitative insights from experienced lawyers, offering a more nuanced view of model performance. This move not only diversifies Harvey’s technological foundation but also puts pressure on its model providers, including its investor OpenAI and investor Google (via GV), to continue innovating and proving their models’ capabilities in real-world, high-stakes applications like law. Harvey’s Perspective and the Competitive Landscape Despite integrating competitor models, Harvey maintains a positive relationship with its initial backer. Harvey CEO Winston Weinberg stated, “We are incredibly fortunate to have OpenAI as an investor in Harvey and key collaborator in our product. And, we are energized to add to our options for customers as we continue to serve the needs of our customers globally.” This strategic shift by a leading Legal AI company like Harvey highlights the intense competition among foundation model providers. While OpenAI remains a dominant force, companies like Anthropic and Google are rapidly advancing their capabilities, making multi-model strategies increasingly attractive for developers building specialized AI applications. The focus is shifting towards leveraging the best available tool for each specific job, rather than being locked into a single provider, even when that provider is also an investor.

DOGE is now gaining pace and might rise toward the $0.2650 zone. DOGE price started a fresh increase above the $0.220 and $0.2320 levels. The price is trading above the $0.2350 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $0.2350 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could start a fresh increase if it clears the $0.2450 resistance zone. Dogecoin Price Aims Higher Dogecoin price started a fresh increase after it found support near $0.2170, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. DOGE climbed and recovered above the $0.2250 resistance zone. The bulls even pushed the price above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.2531 swing high to the $0.2173 low. Besides, there is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $0.2350 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. Dogecoin price is now trading above the $0.2350 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.240 level. The first major resistance for the bulls could be near the $0.2440 level and the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.2531 swing high to the $0.2173 low. The next major resistance is near the $0.2530 level. A close above the $0.2530 resistance might send the price toward the $0.2650 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.2720 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.2850. Another Decline In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.2440 level, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.2350 level. The next major support is near the $0.2250 level. The main support sits at $0.2150. If there is a downside break below the $0.2150 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might decline toward the $0.20 level or even $0.1880 in the near term.

It plans to list on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker ETOR on May 14. Founded in 2007 as a social stock-trading network, eToro added crypto trading in 2018 and has since grown into one of the largest retail crypto brokers. In September, it agreed to limit its US crypto offerings to Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Ether to settle SEC charges that it operated as an unregistered broker and clearing agency. eToro $ETOR looks like a strong IPO upcoming… pic.twitter.com/WvBzD7zPYo — Mike Zaccardi, CFA, CMT (@MikeZaccardi) May 13, 2025 BlackRock Eyes $100M Stake at IPO Price Regulatory filings show eToro seeks to sell 11.92m shares in the upsized deal. BlackRock signaled interest in purchasing up to $100m of shares at the IPO price. Goldman Sachs, Jefferies UBS and Citigroup served as lead underwriters. The Israel-based trading platform had earlier targeted a valuation of up to $4b in the offering. However, the upsized pricing now gives eToro a market cap of about $4.3b based on outstanding shares. Additionally, its fully diluted value approaches $5b once employee options are included. This marks a rebound from a failed 2022 SPAC merger that would have valued the company at more than $10b. At the time, wider market turmoil prompted eToro to pause its public listing plans. Crypto Firms Target US Listings in 2025 The renewed push comes as US IPO activity picks up under the current administration’s more permissive stance on markets and technology companies. Several other crypto firms are eying US IPOs in 2025 amid recovering markets and looser regulations.

44596707,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=160121,1747199439,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Coinbase Unleashes New Wrapped Tokens: cbADA, cbDOGE, cbLTC, cbXRP Incoming",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/coinbase-wrapped-tokens-launch/,"Big news is brewing in the crypto world, specifically from one of its major players. Coinbase recently dropped an announcement on X (formerly Twitter) that has caught the attention of many traders and investors. The platform is preparing to launch new assets bearing the ‘cb’ prefix: cbADA, cbDOGE, cbLTC, and cbXRP. While not yet live, this move signals an interesting strategic direction for the exchange giant and its growing ecosystem. What Exactly Are These Wrapped Tokens on Coinbase? The announcement specifically mentions ‘cbADA’, ‘cbDOGE’, ‘cbLTC’, and ‘cbXRP’. The ‘cb’ prefix strongly suggests these will be wrapped tokens native to Coinbase’s own Layer 2 network, Coinbase Base . Think of a wrapped token as a representation of another cryptocurrency on a different blockchain. It’s like taking a Bitcoin and wrapping it in a standard ERC-20 token on Ethereum (creating wBTC) so it can be used in Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem. In this case, Coinbase appears to be creating wrapped versions of Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE), Litecoin (LTC), and Ripple (XRP) that can live and operate on the Base network. Why do this? Native ADA lives on the Cardano blockchain, DOGE on its own chain, LTC on Litecoin’s chain, and XRP on the XRP Ledger. These blockchains don’t inherently talk to each other directly, especially not with the speed and low cost often desired for activities within a specific ecosystem like a Layer 2 network focused on dApps and DeFi. By creating wrapped versions on Base, Coinbase can potentially: Make these crypto assets easily usable within the Base ecosystem. Enable new trading pairs directly on Base or potentially within Coinbase’s own exchange interface leveraging Base. Allow users to potentially interact with DeFi protocols on Base using these popular assets. It’s important to reiterate that these assets are not yet live . Coinbase’s announcement clearly states that the official launch date will be revealed later. This gives the community time to understand what’s coming and prepare. Why is Coinbase Introducing Wrapped Versions of ADA, DOGE, LTC, and XRP? Coinbase’s strategy with Base is to build a robust, developer-friendly, and user-centric Layer 2 ecosystem. Bringing popular crypto assets like ADA, DOGE, LTC, and XRP onto Base through wrapping aligns perfectly with this goal. Here are some key reasons behind this move: Expanding Base’s Asset Portfolio: To attract users and developers, Base needs a diverse range of assets beyond just ETH and tokens native to Base. Including widely held assets like ADA, DOGE, LTC, and XRP instantly broadens Base’s appeal. Enhancing Utility: By wrapping these tokens, Coinbase potentially unlocks new utility for them within the Base ecosystem. Imagine using cbADA as collateral in a lending protocol on Base, or providing liquidity for a cbDOGE/cbETH pair on a Base-based decentralized exchange (DEX). Deepening Integration: This move further integrates these specific assets into the broader Coinbase product suite, potentially offering seamless transfers between the main exchange and Base, or even enabling specific features tied to the wrapped versions. Responding to Demand: ADA, DOGE, LTC, and XRP have large, active communities. Making it easier for holders of these assets to participate in the growing Base ecosystem could drive significant activity. Competing in the Wrapped Asset Space: Wrapped versions of major cryptocurrencies (like wBTC) are common on other chains. Coinbase creating its own standard for wrapping popular assets positions Base competitively. This isn’t just about listing new tokens; it’s about building bridges between established crypto assets and the emerging opportunities on a Layer 2 network designed for scale and lower costs. What Are the Potential Benefits for Users and Holders? For users of Coinbase and holders of ADA DOGE LTC XRP , the introduction of their wrapped counterparts on Base could offer several advantages: Access to Base Ecosystem: Users can potentially interact with decentralized applications (dApps) and DeFi protocols on Base using their existing holdings of these popular assets, without needing to bridge or swap for ETH or other Base-native tokens first. Lower Transaction Costs: Transactions on Layer 2 networks like Base are typically significantly cheaper and faster than transactions on the native chains of ADA, DOGE, LTC, or XRP, or even Ethereum Layer 1. Potential for New Yield Opportunities: Wrapped assets can often be used in DeFi protocols for lending, borrowing, staking (if supported), or providing liquidity to earn yield. The Base ecosystem is growing, and these wrapped assets could open up new avenues for passive income. Seamless Coinbase Integration: Given that these are ‘cb’ tokens from Coinbase, it’s likely that moving assets between the main Coinbase exchange/wallet and the Base network will be streamlined and user-friendly. Increased Liquidity (Potentially): As these wrapped assets become available and usable on Base, it could lead to increased trading volume and liquidity for these specific wrapped versions within the Base ecosystem. These potential benefits highlight how wrapping assets can unlock new functionalities and efficiencies for users within a specific network environment. Are There Any Challenges or Risks to Consider? While the potential benefits are exciting, it’s crucial to approach the launch of cbADA, cbDOGE, cbLTC, and cbXRP with a clear understanding of the associated risks. As with any wrapped tokens , certain considerations apply: Smart Contract Risk: The process of wrapping and unwrapping relies on smart contracts. If there is a vulnerability or bug in these contracts, it could potentially put the underlying native assets at risk. Counterparty Risk: Wrapped tokens work because a custodian (in this case, presumably Coinbase) holds the native assets in reserve, ideally in a 1:1 ratio with the wrapped tokens issued. Users are trusting Coinbase to securely hold the underlying ADA, DOGE, LTC, and XRP and to facilitate unwrapping when requested. Liquidity Risk: Initially, the liquidity for these wrapped tokens on Base might be low, making large swaps or transactions difficult or subject to significant price slippage. Distinguishing Native vs. Wrapped: Users must be careful to understand the difference between the native ADA, DOGE, LTC, or XRP and their wrapped ‘cb’ versions on Base. Sending a ‘cbDOGE’ token to a native Dogecoin address, for example, would likely result in a loss of funds. Regulatory Uncertainty (Especially XRP): While the wrapped tokens exist on Base, the underlying asset (XRP) has faced significant regulatory scrutiny in the US. How this might impact the wrapped version’s utility or availability on a US-centric platform like Coinbase remains a potential, albeit perhaps low, risk factor depending on evolving regulations. Dependency on Base Network: The utility of these wrapped tokens is tied directly to the health, performance, and adoption of the Coinbase Base network. Users should always perform their own due diligence and understand the specific mechanisms and risks involved before using any wrapped asset. Native vs. Wrapped: Understanding the Key Differences It’s vital not to confuse the original assets with their wrapped versions. Here’s a simple comparison: Feature Native ADA, DOGE, LTC, XRP cbADA, cbDOGE, cbLTC, cbXRP (Wrapped) Blockchain Cardano, Dogecoin, Litecoin, XRP Ledger (respectively) Coinbase Base (Layer 2) Primary Use Case Transactions on their native chains, network consensus, specific chain dApps Transactions on Base, participation in Base dApps/DeFi, potential Coinbase ecosystem integration Transaction Costs Vary depending on the native chain’s network activity Typically lower than native chain transactions due to Base’s Layer 2 nature Compatibility Only compatible with their respective native wallets and networks Compatible with wallets and protocols supporting tokens on the Base network Underlying Asset The original asset itself A token representing the original asset, held in reserve by a custodian (presumably Coinbase) This table highlights that while the value is intended to remain pegged 1:1 (minus minor market fluctuations or fees), the functional layer and associated risks are different. Actionable Insights: What Should You Do Next? Given that these assets are not yet live, now is the time to get informed. Here are some actionable steps: Stay Updated: Keep an eye on official announcements from Coinbase regarding the specific launch date and details for cbADA, cbDOGE, cbLTC, and cbXRP. Learn About Base: If you’re not familiar with the Coinbase Base network, take some time to understand how it works, its benefits, and how to use it. Understand Wrapped Tokens: Educate yourself thoroughly on the concept of wrapped tokens , the wrapping/unwrapping process, and the associated risks (smart contract, counterparty). Evaluate Potential Use Cases: Consider how you might use these wrapped assets once launched. Are you interested in exploring DeFi on Base? Do you want to trade these specific pairs with potentially lower fees? Assess Your Holdings: If you hold native ADA DOGE LTC XRP , think about whether you would want to wrap them to use on Base, or if you prefer to keep them on their native chains or on the main Coinbase exchange. Prioritize Security: When the assets launch, be extremely careful to use the correct network (Base) and understand which version of the token you are handling. Double-check addresses and network selections for all transactions. Being prepared is key to navigating new developments in the fast-paced crypto space. Conclusion: A Strategic Expansion for Coinbase and Base Coinbase’s plan to launch cbADA, cbDOGE, cbLTC, and cbXRP is a significant step in expanding the utility and reach of its Base Layer 2 network. By bringing these widely recognized crypto assets into the Base ecosystem as wrapped tokens , Coinbase is creating new possibilities for users, developers, and the assets themselves. While the potential benefits like lower fees, increased utility, and access to Base’s growing dApp landscape are compelling, users must also be aware of the inherent risks associated with wrapped assets, such as smart contract and counterparty risk. As the official launch date approaches, staying informed and understanding the nuances of these new tokens will be crucial for anyone looking to engage with them on the Coinbase Base platform. This move underscores Coinbase’s commitment to building out its own ecosystem and providing users with more ways to interact with their favorite ADA DOGE LTC XRP and other digital assets.

The Bangkok Post reported on May 13 that Finance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira announced the initiative at a briefing after the cabinet endorsed the plan. He added that the tokens will be launched within the next two months. The so-called “G-tokens” will be used to raise funds from the public under the current budget borrowing plan, said Patchara Anuntasilpa, director-general of the Public Debt Management Office. He added that these were not debt instruments. “One big selling point of the token is that it allows more retail investors to become part of the digital economy,” he said, adding that for as little as $3, “they can invest in government bonds.” Until recently, retail investors have been limited or excluded from large investment product offerings in Thailand, which are predominantly aimed at institutional and wealthy investors. Finance Minister Pichai said the initial token mint is designed to “test the market” and investors will earn higher returns than bank deposits, but did not specify yields. Commercial banks in Thailand offer very low interest rates to savers, currently just 1.25% for a 12-month fixed deposit, which is much lower than rates set by its central bank, which has kept rates elevated until recently despite increasing economic woes.

It would be tradable on licensed digital asset exchanges, which are not accessible to non-Thai citizens residing in the country. Government bonds are debt securities issued by the state to fund public spending. When investors buy them, they are essentially lending money to the government for a specified period in exchange for regular interest payments and the return of their principal at maturity. In February, Thailand’s securities regulator revealed plans to launch a tokenized securities trading system for institutional investors.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has taken a significant step regarding BlackRock’s popular IBIT ETF , signaling a potential shift in how these funds operate. This move is particularly focused on the mechanism by which investors redeem their shares, opening up a crucial discussion that could impact the efficiency and structure of these investment vehicles. SEC Seeks Feedback on In-Kind Redemption for BlackRock’s IBIT The core of the latest development revolves around the SEC’s decision to postpone its final ruling on whether to permit “in-kind” redemptions for BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF , IBIT. When the initial wave of spot Bitcoin ETFs, including IBIT, received approval in January 2024, the SEC mandated a “cash redemption” model. This meant that when an investor wanted to sell their ETF shares, the fund manager (like BlackRock) would sell the underlying Bitcoin and give the investor cash, rather than directly giving them Bitcoin. Now, the regulatory body is revisiting this decision and is actively seeking public comments on the proposal to allow in-kind redemptions. This request for feedback is a standard part of the SEC’s process when considering changes to previously approved structures, especially those with significant market implications. It indicates the SEC is carefully weighing the potential benefits and risks associated with this alternative redemption method. Understanding the Difference: Cash vs. In-Kind Redemption To fully grasp the importance of the SEC’s request, it’s essential to understand the two primary methods of ETF redemption: Cash Redemption: This is the model currently used by approved spot Bitcoin ETF s in the U.S. When an authorized participant (a large financial institution) wants to redeem ETF shares, they receive cash from the fund. The fund manager (e.g., BlackRock for IBIT ETF ) must sell the corresponding amount of Bitcoin on the open market to generate this cash. This process can potentially create taxable events within the fund itself, which may be passed on to ETF shareholders in the form of capital gains distributions, even if the shareholder hasn’t sold their shares. In-Kind Redemption: This is the model the SEC is considering allowing for IBIT and potentially other spot Bitcoin ETF s. When an authorized participant redeems shares, they receive the actual underlying asset – in this case, Bitcoin – directly from the fund, instead of cash. Conversely, for creation, authorized participants would give the fund Bitcoin in exchange for new ETF shares. This method is generally considered more tax-efficient for the fund and its shareholders because the transfer of the underlying asset (Bitcoin) during creation and redemption typically doesn’t trigger a taxable event for the fund itself. It is the standard model for many other commodity and equity ETFs. Why is In-Kind Redemption Preferred by Many? The preference for the in-kind model among many market participants, including asset managers like BlackRock, stems primarily from the potential for increased efficiency and tax advantages. Here’s why it matters: Tax Efficiency: As mentioned, the in-kind model minimizes taxable events within the fund. This can lead to better after-tax returns for investors holding the ETF shares long-term, as they are less likely to receive unexpected capital gains distributions. Reduced Trading Costs: The fund manager doesn’t constantly need to buy and sell Bitcoin on the market to facilitate cash redemptions, potentially reducing transaction costs. Lower Tracking Error: By directly exchanging Bitcoin for shares (and vice versa), the in-kind model can sometimes help the ETF’s price track the underlying asset’s price more closely, as it avoids the potential market impact and timing issues associated with cash transactions. Industry Standard: It aligns the structure of spot Bitcoin ETF s with that of many other established commodity and equity ETFs, which often operate on an in-kind basis. The SEC BlackRock Dialogue: What Are the Regulatory Concerns? While the in-kind model offers potential benefits, the SEC’s initial decision to mandate cash redemptions and its current request for feedback suggest lingering regulatory concerns. These concerns likely revolve around: Market Manipulation Risks: The SEC has historically been wary of the potential for manipulation in the underlying spot Bitcoin market. Allowing authorized participants to directly handle large volumes of Bitcoin during in-kind creations and redemptions might introduce new complexities or perceived risks related to market integrity, depending on the specific mechanisms and participants involved. Custody and Transfer of Bitcoin: Handling large transfers of Bitcoin between authorized participants and the fund requires robust custody solutions and secure transfer protocols. The SEC needs to be comfortable that these processes are secure and compliant. Investor Protection: Ensuring the process is transparent, fair, and doesn’t disadvantage retail investors is paramount for the SEC. Regulatory Framework: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Applying the in-kind model, standard for traditional assets, to a novel asset class like Bitcoin requires careful consideration within the existing regulatory framework. The current public comment period allows the SEC to gather insights from a wide range of stakeholders – investors, market makers, asset managers, compliance experts, and the general public – on how these concerns might be addressed or if they outweigh the benefits of the in-kind model for products like the IBIT ETF . The Public Comment Process: Your Voice Matters The SEC’s request for public comments is a critical part of its rulemaking and decision-making process. It provides an opportunity for anyone interested to submit their views, data, and analysis on the proposal. This feedback helps the commission understand the potential impacts, both positive and negative, from various perspectives. Individuals and organizations can typically submit comments through the SEC’s website, referencing the specific rule or proposal number. The SEC is obligated to review and consider all comments received before making a final determination. This is your chance to weigh in on the future structure of U.S. Bitcoin ETF s and the broader landscape of crypto regulation . What’s Next for IBIT ETF and the Future of Crypto Regulation ? The SEC’s decision on in-kind redemptions for IBIT could set a precedent for other spot Bitcoin ETF s currently operating under the cash-only model. If approved, it could lead to: Improved tax efficiency for long-term ETF holders. Potentially lower operational costs for fund managers. Increased alignment with traditional ETF structures. A signal regarding the SEC’s evolving comfort level with the operational aspects of handling Bitcoin within regulated financial products. Conversely, if the SEC decides against allowing in-kind redemptions, the cash model will remain the standard, potentially keeping tax implications and operational complexities higher than they otherwise might be. The outcome of this decision will be a key indicator of the direction of crypto regulation in the U.S. and its approach to integrating digital assets into mainstream finance. Benefits and Challenges at a Glance Here’s a quick summary of the potential impacts of allowing in-kind redemptions: Potential Benefits: Enhanced tax efficiency for investors Reduced internal fund trading costs Improved tracking accuracy Alignment with standard ETF practices Potential Challenges/Concerns (from a regulatory perspective): Potential market manipulation risks in the underlying asset Operational complexities of handling Bitcoin transfers Ensuring robust custody and security Navigating the evolving crypto regulation landscape Conclusion The SEC’s request for public feedback on allowing in-kind redemptions for BlackRock’s IBIT ETF is a pivotal moment for the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF market. While the current cash redemption model was a necessary compromise for initial approval, the potential shift to an in-kind model could bring significant benefits, particularly in terms of tax efficiency for investors. However, regulatory concerns surrounding the unique nature of Bitcoin and its market persist. The outcome of this review process, heavily influenced by the public comments received, will not only shape the future operations of funds like the IBIT ETF but also provide valuable insight into the SEC’s ongoing approach to integrating digital assets into the regulated financial system. It’s a development worth watching closely for anyone invested in or following the intersection of traditional finance and cryptocurrencies.

Thanks to a solid technical setup and growing interest in its DeFi ecosystem, the price has increased 6% over the last day and 22% over the last week. Solana’s ( SOL ) open interest has also risen by 11.08%, as per Coinglass data . This implies that there are more traders entering the market with new contracts, which usually indicates growing investor confidence. According to DeFiLlama data , Solana’s total value locked increased from $7.5 billion at the beginning of May to $9.6 billion at the time of writing. Leading the charge have been platforms like Marinade (up 56%), Jito (up 41%), and Raydium (up 78%). Additionally, weekly decentralized exchange volumes increased, rising from $18 billion the week before to $22 billion last week. Chain activity remains strong. Revenues and transaction fees on Solana have been steadily climbing for four weeks, nearing three-month highs. With 65% of SOL staked, a combination of the demand from DeFi usage and the limited supply could support price growth. But not every metric is positive. Solana’s overall stablecoin market capitalization dropped by 8% to $11.7 billion in the past seven days. At 8%, the funding rate indicates that traders are paying more to hold long positions, which is a sign of bullish sentiment but also one that frequently precedes short-term corrections.

However, overbought conditions are indicated by the relative strength index, which is at 71. Solana price analysis. Credit: crypto.news The Bollinger Bands are widening, and SOL is now trading close to the upper band. This typically comes before a period of correction or consolidation and indicates high volatility. Immediate resistance lies near $185, the top of the current band. A breakout above this could open the path to $200. On the downside, support is seen around $157 (20-day EMA) and $130, where the lower Bollinger band and previous consolidation zone align. Looking ahead, bullish momentum could continue if SOL breaks above $185 with volume. A rejection here, however, may trigger a pullback to support levels. While SOL remains 39% below its all-time high of $295, growing institutional interest, possible ETF approval, and upcoming upgrades like Firedancer suggest that the road to $200 seems more likely if market conditions hold.

Here’s The Truth,https://coinpedia.org/news/is-nvidia-buying-bitcoin-heres-the-truth/,"The post Is Nvidia Buying Bitcoin? Here’s The Truth appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A new wave of speculation has hit the crypto and tech communities. Will Nvidia, the AI and GPU giant, follow in the footsteps of MicroStrategy and Tesla by adding Bitcoin to its treasury? While there’s no official confirmation, the rumors have sparked a wider debate about whether Bitcoin could be a strategic play for Nvidia amid growing market pressures. What’s Fueling the Rumor? Is Nvidia Considering Adding Bitcoin to its Balance Sheet? h/t @Barchart pic.twitter.com/6jXoogXOGc — Lark Davis (@TheCryptoLark) May 6, 2025 Over recent weeks, social media chatter has hinted at Nvidia considering Bitcoin as a treasury asset. The company hasn’t commented, and there’s no evidence to confirm the reports. However, the idea isn’t far-fetched, especially given the economic turbulence Nvidia is currently facing. Following the news, the tech powerhouse, which has been a dominant player in AI and GPU technology, has seen its stock drop around 35% since January. Pressure from US tariffs , global inflation, and increasing competition, particularly from China’s Huawei, has added to the weight. Some believe that diversifying into Bitcoin could help Nvidia navigate this uncertain environment. Why Bitcoin Might Make Sense for Nvidia Industry experts say a Bitcoin allocation could position Nvidia as a visionary player aligned with the future of finance. Bitcoin’s fixed supply and independence from traditional markets make it an appealing hedge against inflation, something forward-looking companies are increasingly considering. Banxe CEO Alex Guts pointed out that over 630,000 BTC is now held by corporate treasuries, showing growing institutional adoption . Nvidia’s past ties to crypto mining, its GPUs were once the backbone of mining rigs, could further justify a move into Bitcoin. Moreover, adding Bitcoin could also boost Nvidia’s image with younger, tech-savvy investors and employees who already support crypto initiatives. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Semler Scientific Reports 21.9% BTC Yield in Q1: Company Now Holds 3,808 Bitcoin , But It’s Not All Rosy Despite the potential upsides, Bitcoin is notoriously volatile. That could bring new risks to Nvidia’s financials, especially since current accounting rules treat Bitcoin as an “intangible asset,” meaning losses would hit the books hard, even if not realized. CoinShares analyst Satish Patel noted that Nvidia already uses foreign exchange hedging to manage inflation risks. So while Bitcoin could diversify Nvidia’s assets, it may not be essential. Dean Chen of Bitunix warned that Bitcoin’s short-term swings could be damaging rather than helpful unless Nvidia takes a long-term approach. So, Will Nvidia Take the Leap? There’s no official word yet, and while Nvidia has the financial cushion to take on Bitcoin’s volatility, the move would need to align with a broader long-term vision, not just serve as a quick fix for falling stock prices. For now, the buzz remains just that, rumors. But even talk of such a move signals how far Bitcoin has come in gaining corporate attention. If Nvidia does decide to jump in, it could further reshape how the market views crypto as a legitimate corporate asset. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Separately, the Trump administration issued new guidance clarifying that the use of Huawei Technologies’ Ascend AI chips “anywhere in the world” violates US export controls. Officials also warned of potential consequences for allowing US-developed AI chips to be used in training Chinese AI models. Markets are now focused on President Trump’s upcoming visit to the Middle East, timed with peak fuel demand, with oil price stability likely a key objective.

Robinhood announced its $179 million acquisition of WonderFi, a company that owns two of Canada’s leading regulated crypto platforms, Bitbuy and Coinsquare. Meanwhile, Coinbase is investing in Canadian stablecoin issuer Stablecorp to promote the adoption of QCAD, a tokenized version of the Canadian dollar. Coinbase and Stablecorp Partner to Push Canadian Dollar Stablecoin Amid Regulatory Hurdles Coinbase has announced a strategic partnership with Stablecorp, the Canadian fintech firm behind the QCAD stablecoin. The collaboration, revealed during the Blockchain Futurist Conference in Toronto, includes an undisclosed investment by Coinbase and a joint marketing campaign to boost adoption of QCAD — a fiat-backed, tokenized version of the Canadian dollar. Stablecorp’s flagship product QCAD, (Source: Stablecorp ) Lucas Matheson, CEO of Coinbase Canada, said in a recent interview that stablecoins are “especially urgent” for Canadian users, citing the country’s outdated payment infrastructure. “It’s really important that we have a stablecoin for Canadians,” Matheson emphasized, highlighting how “wire transfers cost $45 and take 45 minutes of paperwork” in Canada. “Canada has no peer-to-peer payment rail,” he added. “With stablecoins, 24/7, instant, borderless payments become possible — this is already feasible with existing tech.” Addressing Canada’s Payment Bottlenecks The push for QCAD adoption is part of a larger trend in which financial institutions are embracing blockchain technology to enable faster, cheaper, and more accessible financial transactions. While global stablecoin leaders like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) dominate with a combined market cap exceeding $245 billion, homegrown options like QCAD remain niche due to a host of structural and regulatory challenges. Stablecorp's QCAD — one of the first fiat-backed stablecoins denominated in Canadian dollars — is backed 1:1 with Canadian fiat reserves. However, as of July 2024, the company reported that only around $175,000 worth of QCAD were in circulation, underscoring the slow pace of local adoption. “Canada lacks a clear path for stablecoin adoption,” Coinbase said in a March 26 blog post , attributing the issue to ongoing legal ambiguity. “Fiat-backed stablecoins need to be treated as payment instruments rather than securities,” the exchange urged, adding that the current framework hinders innovation and widespread use. The announcement comes at a pivotal time for the Canadian crypto industry. Just last month, Mark Carney — a former governor of the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England — was elected as the country’s new Prime Minister. Known for his skepticism toward cryptocurrencies, Carney’s leadership introduces new questions about the government’s approach to digital assets. Nevertheless, Matheson expressed optimism: “We’re asking the federal government to develop a national strategy for digital assets. Crypto is strategic, and we hope this new administration sees that.” The comments reflect a growing consensus among Canadian crypto executives that the federal government must catch up to jurisdictions like the United States, where regulators are starting to differentiate between payment-focused stablecoins and speculative digital assets. In April, the US Securities and Exchange Commission clarified that stablecoins marketed strictly as payment tools do not qualify as securities — a regulatory position that Coinbase believes Canada should emulate. The Future of QCAD and Canadian Crypto For Coinbase, the partnership with Stablecorp is not just about pushing a new stablecoin — it’s about laying the foundation for a more inclusive, cost-effective, and modern financial system in Canada. If successful, QCAD could provide Canadians with a stable and regulated on-chain alternative to traditional bank transfers and help close the payment efficiency gap that has left the country behind other G7 economies. Stablecorp has yet to release a new reserve report since July 2024, a fact that may raise transparency concerns for potential users. Still, the involvement of a global giant like Coinbase may lend the project the credibility and scale it needs to break through to mainstream use. Robinhood to Acquire WonderFi for $179 Million in Strategic Canadian Expansion In related news, Robinhood Markets Inc., the popular US-based fintech known for pioneering commission-free stock and crypto trading, has announced its latest international push with the acquisition of Canadian crypto firm WonderFi in a $250 million CAD ($179 million USD) all-cash deal. The acquisition, set to close in the second half of 2025, marks another step in Robinhood’s global expansion and deepening commitment to the crypto sector. According to Robinhood’s May 13 press release, the deal will bring WonderFi’s full suite of digital asset platforms under the company’s umbrella, including Bitbuy and Coinsquare — two of Canada’s oldest and most regulated crypto trading platforms. The acquisition will significantly bolster Robinhood’s presence in the Canadian market and grant access to more than 2.1 billion CAD in assets under custody across WonderFi’s platforms. “WonderFi has built a formidable family of brands serving beginner and advanced crypto users alike, making them an ideal partner to accelerate Robinhood’s mission in Canada,” said Johann Kerbrat, senior vice president and general manager of Robinhood Crypto. WonderFi, a publicly traded company on the Toronto Stock Exchange, has spent the past several years consolidating Canada’s fragmented crypto market. In 2024, the firm processed over 3.57 billion CAD in trading volume — a 28% increase year-over-year — while providing staking and custody services in addition to core crypto trading. Wonderfi share price surges after deal announcement (Source: Google Finance ) The acquisition offer of 0.36 CAD per share represents a 41% premium over WonderFi’s last closing price and a 71% premium over its 30-day volume-weighted average. Before the deal was announced, WonderFi’s market capitalization stood at 163.9 million CAD, with its stock having declined 13.6% year-to-date. Subject to shareholder, regulatory, and court approvals, the deal could mark a significant reshaping of the Canadian crypto industry, with Robinhood set to inherit a key foothold in a region that has yet to fully embrace retail digital asset adoption at scale. Riding the 2025 Crypto M&A Wave Robinhood’s move comes amid a broader surge in cryptocurrency mergers and acquisitions fueled by improved regulatory clarity under US President Donald Trump’s administration. Companies are seizing the opportunity to scale globally, attract new users, and expand into strategic markets. In just the first half of 2025, the crypto industry has seen several landmark acquisitions. Coinbase acquired crypto derivatives exchange Deribit for $2.9 billion, and Ripple bought prime brokerage platform Hidden Road for $1.25 billion. Earlier this month, Kraken completed its acquisition of NinjaTrader, enabling the platform to offer crypto derivatives in the US market. Robinhood itself has been particularly active in expanding its crypto footprint. Last year, it acquired Bitstamp for $200 million, giving the firm access to institutional-grade infrastructure and clients. More recently, reports surfaced that Robinhood is developing a blockchain network to help European retail investors trade US securities — a move that could position it as a global financial superapp. While Canada has developed a more structured regulatory environment for crypto firms than many jurisdictions, it remains a cautious market. WonderFi’s operations under Canadian regulators will offer Robinhood a streamlined entry point into the country’s crypto space with compliant infrastructure already in place. Still, the deal must pass several layers of approval — including from WonderFi shareholders, regulatory agencies, and the courts. Should it go through, the acquisition will likely accelerate Robinhood’s capacity to offer more crypto services to Canadians, possibly including access to its broader trading ecosystem, which merges traditional equities and digital assets under one platform.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-14 05:30:00
44597043,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=160124,1747200602,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Coinbase Investment: A Breakthrough for Canadian Stablecoins and Crypto Payments,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/coinbase-invests-canadian-stablecoin/,"In a move set to potentially reshape the landscape of digital finance in the Great White North, Coinbase , one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, has made a significant Coinbase investment in Canadian stablecoin issuer, Stablecorp. This strategic partnership aims to bolster the adoption and utility of Stablecorp QCAD , a Canadian dollar-backed stablecoin, paving the way for faster, more efficient crypto payments across Canada. Why is Coinbase Betting on Stablecorp QCAD? The core motivation behind Coinbase’s investment is clear: to address the existing inefficiencies within Canada’s payment systems. According to reports, Stablecorp CEO Lucas Matheson highlighted the pressing need for payment solutions that are not only faster but also significantly lower in cost compared to traditional methods. This aligns perfectly with the inherent advantages offered by stablecoins like QCAD. Stablecorp QCAD is designed to maintain a stable value pegged 1:1 with the Canadian dollar. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, QCAD offers the stability of fiat currency combined with the speed, transparency, and cost-effectiveness of blockchain technology. This makes it an ideal candidate for everyday transactions, remittances, and business payments where price stability is paramount. Coinbase’s backing provides Stablecorp with crucial capital and, perhaps more importantly, the endorsement and potential integration opportunities from a global crypto giant. This can accelerate QCAD’s reach and utility within the Canadian market and potentially beyond. The Push for Clear Stablecoin Regulation in Canada Beyond the direct investment, Coinbase is actively engaging with Canadian regulators. A key part of their strategy involves advocating for stablecoins to be classified and treated as payment instruments rather than securities. This distinction is critical for broader adoption. Treating stablecoins solely as securities could subject them to stringent regulatory requirements designed for investment products, potentially hindering their use as a medium of exchange for goods and services. By advocating for a payments-focused regulatory framework, Coinbase aims to create a clearer, more favorable environment for stablecoins like Stablecorp QCAD to thrive as a viable payment option for individuals and businesses. This advocacy is not unique to Canada; exchanges and stablecoin issuers globally are pushing for regulatory clarity that acknowledges the dual nature of stablecoins – potentially an investment vehicle in some contexts, but primarily a payment tool in others. Success in establishing a clear regulatory path in Canada could serve as a model for other jurisdictions. Understanding the Canadian Stablecoin Landscape While the global stablecoin market is dominated by tokens pegged to the US dollar (like USDT, USDC), the demand for stablecoins pegged to other fiat currencies, such as the Canadian dollar, is growing. A Canadian stablecoin like QCAD offers specific advantages for Canadian residents and businesses: Reduced Exchange Risk: No need to worry about CAD/USD exchange rate fluctuations when using QCAD for domestic transactions. Local Relevance: Directly aligns with the national currency, making it more intuitive for Canadian users. Support for the Canadian Economy: Potentially keeps value within the Canadian financial ecosystem. Prior to QCAD, the options for Canadian dollar-pegged stablecoins were limited. Stablecorp’s offering fills this gap, providing a much-needed digital asset that reflects the local economy. Coinbase’s investment signals confidence in the potential for significant growth in the Canadian stablecoin market. Benefits of Stablecoins for Crypto Payments Why are stablecoins considered transformative for payments? Their advantages over traditional methods and volatile cryptocurrencies are compelling: Speed: Transactions can settle in minutes, regardless of geographical location or banking hours. Cost-Effectiveness: Transaction fees are typically much lower than traditional wire transfers or international payments. Accessibility: Available 24/7 to anyone with internet access and a crypto wallet, potentially banking the unbanked. Programmability: Can be integrated into smart contracts for automated payments, escrow, and other complex financial operations. Stability: Value is pegged to a stable asset (like CAD), eliminating the price volatility risk associated with using assets like Bitcoin for payments. For businesses, adopting Stablecorp QCAD could mean faster settlement of invoices, reduced transaction costs, and new opportunities for integrating payments into digital platforms. For individuals, it could offer a cheaper way to send money domestically or internationally. Challenges and Opportunities for Stablecorp QCAD Adoption Despite the significant boost from the Coinbase investment, Stablecorp QCAD faces challenges on the path to widespread adoption: Regulatory Uncertainty: While advocacy is ongoing, the lack of definitive stablecoin regulation in Canada remains a hurdle. Businesses need clarity before fully committing. Awareness and Education: Many Canadians are still unfamiliar with stablecoins and how they differ from other cryptocurrencies. Significant effort is needed for public education. Integration with Existing Systems: Seamless integration with existing financial infrastructure, point-of-sale systems, and e-commerce platforms is crucial for convenience. Competition: While QCAD is a prominent Canadian stablecoin, it faces competition from other potential entrants and, indirectly, from established payment networks. Scaling Infrastructure: As adoption grows, the underlying blockchain infrastructure needs to scale efficiently and securely. However, these challenges also present opportunities. The early-mover advantage in the Canadian stablecoin space, coupled with Coinbase’s support, positions Stablecorp well. The increasing global trend towards digital payments and the exploration of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) also creates a favorable environment for stablecoin discussions and adoption. Actionable Insights for the Canadian Market What does this development mean for different stakeholders in Canada? For Businesses: Explore integrating QCAD as a payment option. Research potential cost savings and efficiency gains. Stay informed about regulatory developments. For Consumers: Learn about QCAD and stablecoins. Consider using wallets that support QCAD for sending/receiving payments. Understand the risks and benefits. For Developers: Look into building applications and services that leverage QCAD for payments or other financial functionalities. For Regulators: Engage with industry participants like Coinbase and Stablecorp to develop a clear, proportionate regulatory framework that fosters innovation while protecting consumers and financial stability. The investment serves as a strong signal that major players view the Canadian market as ripe for digital payment innovation, particularly through stablecoins. The Future of Crypto Payments in Canada Coinbase’s investment in Stablecorp is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a strategic move aimed at accelerating the adoption of stablecoins for real-world use cases in Canada. By backing Stablecorp QCAD and advocating for sensible stablecoin regulation , Coinbase is actively working to lower the barriers to entry for crypto payments and digital finance within the country. The success of QCAD and other stablecoins in Canada will likely depend on a combination of technological development, regulatory clarity, and public acceptance. This investment is a significant step forward, providing the resources and momentum needed to tackle these factors head-on. It highlights the growing global trend of integrating digital assets into mainstream financial activities, starting with fundamental functions like payments. Summary: A New Chapter for Canadian Digital Finance The Coinbase investment in Stablecorp marks a pivotal moment for the Canadian stablecoin market and the future of crypto payments in the country. By supporting Stablecorp QCAD and advocating for progressive stablecoin regulation , Coinbase is championing the cause of faster, cheaper, and more accessible digital transactions. While challenges remain, this partnership injects significant momentum into the effort to make stablecoins a common tool for everyday finance in Canada, potentially unlocking new economic opportunities and driving innovation in the digital economy.

The asset recorded a 20% rise on the weekly chart before retreating slightly. At the time of writing, XRP trades at $2.54, reflecting a 2% decline in the past 24 hours. Despite the minor dip, the asset remains well above recent local lows and is showing signs of growing trader interest. According to a new analysis shared by CryptoQuant contributor BorisVest, activity in XRP derivatives on Binance indicates potential accumulation amid increasing speculative interest. Related Reading: XRP Price To Rally To $6: Partially Completed Wave 5 Says There’s Still Room To Run The market, which previously saw a steep drop in open interest, is now witnessing a resurgence in leveraged trading positions. These on-chain dynamics may be hinting at a shift in sentiment as participants return following the earlier flush-out. XRP Open Interest Rebounds as Traders Re-Enter the Market Open interest, defined as the total number of active futures contracts not yet settled—serves as a gauge for market engagement. When open interest increases alongside price, it often suggests rising speculative participation. In XRP’s case, the data shows a sharp rebound from a previous $530 million low to a higher range, suggesting a recovery in market confidence after a significant drop from its $1.5 billion peak. BorisVest also analyzed Binance funding rates, which reflect the cost of maintaining long or short positions in perpetual futures. These rates become positive when long positions dominate and negative when short interest prevails. During XRP’s recent correction, the funding rate turned negative, indicating an influx of short positions and setting up conditions for a possible short squeeze. A short squeeze occurs when short sellers are forced to buy back their positions due to rising prices, often resulting in rapid upward price movements. Currently, the funding rate is neutral, suggesting equilibrium between bullish and bearish positions, though subtle signals point to increasing short exposure. Taker Sell Pressure Meets Steady Price: Signs of Absorption? Another metric underlined in the analysis is the Taker Buy/Sell Ratio. This indicator compares the volume of aggressive buy orders (market buys) against sell orders (market sells). A ratio below 1 implies that sellers are more aggressive. In this case, XRP’s Taker Buy/Sell Ratio stands at 0.91, meaning selling pressure dominates. However, the absence of significant price declines despite the pressure implies potential absorption by larger players, which can be a precursor to bullish price movements. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Must Clear This Level Or Risk Crash To $1.9 The combination of rising open interest, neutral funding rates, and sustained price levels despite sell pressure suggests that XRP may be experiencing silent accumulation. While the market remains indecisive, these patterns are often observed in the early stages of a trend reversal or breakout. As speculative activity picks up, it could be worth monitoring these signals closely for further confirmation. Whether this leads to a continuation of XRP’s rally or not, the current data points to a market that is actively recalibrating, and possibly preparing for the next phase in price action.

At the same time the agency invited public comments on BlackRock’s plan to shift its flagship Bitcoin ETF to an in-kind redemption model and on Nasdaq’s bid to list the 21Shares Dogecoin ETF. The moves underscore Washington’s cautious yet increasingly structured approach to bringing a wider range of crypto assets into the regulated fund universe. Solana Trust Under Microscope Staff will spend the coming weeks determining whether Grayscale’s Solana Trust satisfies investor-protection and market-integrity requirements set out in Section 6(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act. If approved the vehicle would hold SOL tokens in cold storage and trade on NYSE Arca, giving retail investors indirect exposure without setting up self-custody. The SEC has up to 240 days—and multiple chances to pause the clock—before issuing a final ruling, meaning the earliest green light could slip past September. Litecoin Also Waits Grayscale’s Litecoin Trust received a parallel delay as commissioners opened formal proceedings to gather additional evidence and rebuttals. Questions center on whether Litecoin markets are sufficiently surveilled to detect manipulation and whether existing futures oversight on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange offers a viable benchmark. Both altcoin filings remain on hold until staff completes the deeper dive mandated by Tuesday’s notice. BlackRock Reworks Bitcoin Redemption Model Separately, Nasdaq’s filing to amend the iShares Bitcoin Trust is now in a 21-day comment window that will test appetite for so-called in-kind redemptions. Under the proposal authorized participants could exchange ETF shares directly for Bitcoin rather than cash, a structure BlackRock says would reduce tracking error and capital-gains events. The SEC approved the fund in January with a cash-only mechanism but signaled openness to alternative workflows once operational safeguards were in place. Industry lawyers expect a decision on the amendment before the fourth quarter, provided no major objections arise during the rebuttal phase. Dogecoin ETF Opens to Feedback Nasdaq also submitted paperwork to list the 21Shares Dogecoin ETF under Rule 5711(d), the same framework used for commodity-based trust shares like gold. The passive fund intends to mirror Dogecoin’s price via a CF Benchmarks reference rate and store coins with regulated custodian Coinbase. Backers view the meme-coin product as a litmus test for how far the SEC is willing to extend spot-crypto approvals beyond the large-cap duo of Bitcoin and Ether. Why the SEC Is Pressing Pause New Chair Paul Atkins has vowed to replace the previous regime’s enforcement-first posture with clearer rulemaking but insists each novel ETF “meets the law as written.” Delays allow staff to solicit data on trading volumes, offshore liquidity, and correlation between spot and futures prices—metrics commissioners say are key to detecting wash trades. The agency also weighs whether surveillance-sharing agreements with major platforms will meaningfully curb insider manipulation before retail money can flow in. Altcoin ETF Pipeline Widens At least a dozen issuers, including 21Shares, Bitwise, and WisdomTree, have registered or signaled intent to launch funds tied to XRP, Avalanche, and even meme-tokens like Shiba Inu. Bloomberg Intelligence estimates that more than $15 billion could migrate into altcoin funds within two years if the SEC gives even a handful the green light. For now, however, only Bitcoin and Ether spot products have crossed the finish line, and both required multiyear legal tussles. Market Reaction and Outlook Prices for SOL and LTC drifted lower after the notice, though most analysts attributed the dip to broader risk-off sentiment rather than the procedural delay. Dogecoin held steady near $0.28 as traders judged the start of a comment period to be net positive, keeping hopes alive for a first-of-its-kind meme-coin ETF. Strategists at Galaxy Digital wrote in a note that the SEC’s staggered approach “signals momentum, not resistance,” provided applicants can supply robust market-surveillance data. Still, they cautioned that a single high-profile hack or manipulation incident could prompt regulators to reapply the brakes. Timeline From Here Commenters have until June 4 to weigh in on BlackRock’s amendment and until June 7 on the Dogecoin proposal, after which rebuttals may be filed for an additional 35 days. The Solana and Litecoin dockets now await a second SEC extension, a step that would push the ultimate decision into early autumn. Market participants will track those deadlines closely, viewing each incremental action as a barometer of how quickly U.S. regulators are prepared to mainstream the next wave of crypto assets.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|LTC|REGULATION|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-05-14 05:34:44

As the country heads toward its June 3 presidential election, the Democratic Party has placed digital assets at the heart of its campaign, forming a dedicated Digital Asset Committee to take control of regulation and reform. South Korea Crypto Law The committee held its first meeting on May 13 at the National Assembly in Seoul, bringing together lawmakers, government officials, and top figures from local exchanges like Upbit, Bithumb, Coinbit, and Gopax. Its goal is clear: centralize crypto policymaking under the president’s office. Lawmaker Min Byeong-deok, who chairs the group, said the structure is meant to drive real policy, not just discussions. The committee is already at work drafting key legislation, including the much-anticipated “Stage 2 Bill” that will shape South Korea’s digital asset framework. Committee Chairman Min Byeong-deok also criticized the country’s current “one exchange, one bank” system, calling it limiting for crypto businesses. The group plans to work with regulators to update this framework and explore whether stablecoins should require licensing or simple reporting. Two core divisions are leading the charge, one focused on tech innovation, the other on building regulatory systems. Four subgroups will cover user protection, legal reform, industry growth, and external cooperation. Stablecoins Take Center Stage One of the major discussion points is stablecoins , especially those pegged to the Korean won. Democratic Party candidate Lee Jae-myung is pushing for quick market entry, even proposing a won-linked stablecoin. But memories of the Terra-Luna collapse are still fresh, and critics are calling for caution. There’s still no clear answer on whether stablecoins should require a license or just registration. Even the question of who should oversee them, the Bank of Korea or the Financial Services Commission, remains unresolved. Min acknowledged that current banking partnerships with exchanges are limiting growth and need reform. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : NYC Mayor Eric Adams Wants New York City To Be The Crypto Capital , Central Bank Isn’t Backing Down The Bank of Korea has made its stance clear. Just before the committee’s debut, BOK officials insisted they must have the final say on KRW-based stablecoins. The central bank warned that excluding them from early-stage discussions could destabilize national monetary policy. Koh Kyung-chul from the BOK’s electronic finance division called for legal frameworks that protect financial stability before innovation. Crypto as a Campaign Battleground With over 16 million South Koreans in crypto, the upcoming election is turning into a digital finance showdown. Lee Jae-myung aims to boost innovation and prevent capital flight, while Kim Moon-soo backs public fund investment and regulatory reforms. Crypto is now a central issue shaping South Korea’s financial future. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Recently, CoinShares, a prominent player in this space, released its Q1 earnings report, revealing a significant dip in profitability that has caught the attention of investors and market watchers alike. The headline figure? A substantial 42.2% year-on-year decline in net profit for the first quarter. Understanding CoinShares and Its Q1 Earnings CoinShares is a well-established digital asset management group, known for its wide range of exchange-traded products (ETPs) and investment solutions focused on cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Their business model is heavily influenced by the performance and trading volume within the digital asset market. Therefore, their quarterly financial results serve as a key indicator not just of the company’s performance, but also of the prevailing crypto market trends. For the first quarter, CoinShares reported a net profit of $24 million. While still a considerable sum, this represents a sharp decrease compared to the same period in the previous year. This decline in Q1 earnings highlights the challenging operating environment encountered during the early months of the year. What Caused the Decline in Financial Results? According to the report, the primary culprit behind the reduced profitability was the impact of macroeconomic headwinds. But what exactly does that mean in the context of digital assets and CoinShares’ business? Macroeconomic headwinds refer to large-scale economic conditions that negatively affect business growth and profitability. In Q1, these factors included: Rising Inflation: Persistent high inflation prompted central banks globally to signal or begin interest rate hikes. Interest Rate Hikes: Tighter monetary policy generally reduces investor appetite for riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies. Geopolitical Tensions: Events like conflicts can increase market uncertainty and volatility, leading investors to move towards safer assets. Recession Fears: Growing concerns about a potential economic slowdown or recession can dampen overall investment activity. These factors collectively created a challenging backdrop for digital assets. Increased market volatility, coupled with a general risk-off sentiment among investors, led to reduced trading volumes and potentially lower assets under management (AUM) or slower AUM growth for firms like CoinShares. Since CoinShares’ revenue is often linked to AUM and trading fees, a downturn in market activity directly impacts their financial results. How Do Macroeconomic Headwinds Impact Digital Asset Management? The business of digital asset management thrives when the market is bullish, attracting new investors and increasing the value of existing holdings. Conversely, during periods of significant market stress or downturns driven by macroeconomic factors, several challenges emerge: Reduced Assets Under Management (AUM): As cryptocurrency prices fall, the value of the assets managed by firms like CoinShares decreases, directly impacting fee income which is often calculated as a percentage of AUM. Lower Trading Volume: In uncertain markets, investors may trade less frequently, reducing the revenue generated from transaction fees or trading-related services. Increased Redemptions: Some investors may choose to withdraw their investments during downturns, further decreasing AUM. Difficulty Launching New Products: A bearish sentiment can make it harder to attract investment into new digital asset products or funds. The 42% drop in CoinShares’ net profit is a clear illustration of how susceptible even leading digital asset management firms are to the broader economic climate and prevailing crypto market trends. What Does This Tell Us About Crypto Market Trends in Q1? CoinShares’ financial results corroborate the narrative that Q1 was a tough period for the cryptocurrency market. While there may have been intermittent rallies, the dominant trend was one of caution and price depreciation for many major digital assets, influenced heavily by the macroeconomic environment. This makes the Q1 earnings report from CoinShares not just company news, but also a valuable data point for understanding the overall market sentiment and performance during that time. Navigating the Challenges: What’s Next? Facing a decline in financial results due to external pressures is a challenge, but it also prompts strategic responses. Digital asset management firms in such environments often focus on cost management, product innovation (perhaps exploring less volatile strategies or new asset classes), and strengthening their balance sheets to weather the downturn. For investors and those following crypto market trends, CoinShares’ report serves as a reminder that the digital asset space is not immune to global economic forces. Understanding the interplay between macroeconomic factors and cryptocurrency performance is crucial for making informed decisions. While the Q1 earnings showed a significant drop, it’s important to consider this within the context of a challenging quarter for the entire industry. The ability of firms like CoinShares to navigate these periods will be key to their long-term success and the continued maturation of the digital asset management sector. Summary: A Sobering Look at Q1 Financial Results CoinShares’ report of a 42% year-on-year drop in Q1 net profit to $24 million underscores the significant impact of macroeconomic headwinds on the digital asset management industry. The challenging crypto market trends driven by factors like inflation and interest rate hikes directly affected the company’s financial results, leading to reduced profitability. This serves as a stark reminder that while the digital asset space offers unique opportunities, it remains connected to and influenced by the broader global economic landscape. The performance of key players like CoinShares provides valuable insights into the health and challenges facing the sector.

The predictions follow renewed momentum in the broader cryptocurrency market, driven by Bitcoin’s recent surge above $100,000. XRP has participated in this recovery, trading around $2.40 as of the latest data and attempting to consolidate within the higher end of the $2 range . Several analysts believe this consolidation could precede a major breakout, with historical precedents and chart patterns indicating further gains. Technical Patterns Supporting the $7 Target One of the more prominent voices supporting a bullish outlook for XRP is market analyst Mags. He previously forecasted XRP’s rally from below $0.50, a prediction that materialized as the asset gained nearly 600% between November 2024 and January 2025. That surge took XRP to a peak of $3.4 before a correction drove it into a consolidation phase near $2, where it has remained since February. $XRP is going to $7 Shared XRP below $0.5 before it went 6x. The current consolidation looks similar to what we saw back in 2017-18 before the blow off top. Expecting something similar. easy 2-3x from here.. https://t.co/GG8uHFwRvK pic.twitter.com/b9juSGSp5y — Mags (@thescalpingpro) May 10, 2025 Mags argues that XRP’s current pattern is similar to its price structure from 2017 to 2018. According to his analysis, the asset typically undergoes four phases during a market cycle: a first bounce, accumulation, a parabolic run, and a blow-off top. The analyst believes XRP is now transitioning into the final phase. Referring to historical price action from 2017, Mags noted that XRP had a parabolic phase from March to May, then consolidated for 6 months before the blow-off top.” Applying this framework to the present market, he projects a potential rise to $7.3 from the current range, representing a 202% increase. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Breakout from Multi-Year Pattern Signals $15 Possibility While Mags sees $7.3 as a realistic target, other analysts foresee an even larger rally. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has identified a breakout from a symmetrical triangle pattern formed over nearly seven years, from January 2018 through November 2024. This breakout after the 2024 U.S. elections propelled XRP above the $2 mark. Martinez maintains that the triangle breakout remains influential and expects XRP to extend its gains significantly. He noted XRP could rise to $15, representing a 522% increase from current levels. This projection is rooted in the typical behavior of assets following a breakout from such long-term formations. RSI Trends Reinforce the Bullish Outlook Additional confirmation of XRP’s potential upward trajectory comes from the analyst behind the Crypto Crew University platform. In a recent analysis, he emphasized that the asset replicates an RSI (Relative Strength Index) behavior seen during previous market cycles. He stated that XRP may be entering another RSI surge similar to those observed in 2017 and 2021, which preceded significant rallies. “In both 2017 & 2021, a second #RSI explosion above 65 triggered massive moves,” he said. He further pointed out that the current Stock RSI cross-up could be an early indicator that the next RSI-driven move is underway. XRP’s consolidation around the $2 mark attracts increased attention as analysts highlight historical similarities, long-term chart breakouts, and key momentum signals. While some analysts, like Mags, anticipate a move toward $7.3 based on past cycle patterns, others, such as Martinez, see room for a climb to $15 if technical structures play out. With multiple indicators aligning, the asset appears poised for a potential continuation of its bullish trend in the coming months.

44597689,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=160119,1747201827,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,US Stock Market: Nasdaq Soars as Dow Jones Stumbles – Decoding Mixed Market Trends,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-stock-market-mixed-close/,"In a trading session that offered a tale of two markets, major US stock market indices closed with divergent results, leaving investors pondering the underlying dynamics. While tech-heavy growth stocks powered the Nasdaq and S&P 500 higher, traditional industrial giants lagged, pulling the Dow Jones into negative territory. For those tracking the often-correlated world of cryptocurrency, understanding these nuanced movements in the broader financial landscape is crucial. Decoding the Latest US Stock Market Performance The closing bell revealed a split decision from Wall Street: S&P 500: Gained 0.72% Nasdaq Composite: Rose a significant 1.58% Dow Jones Industrial Average: Dipped 0.64% This mixed outcome highlights a period where different sectors of the economy and different types of companies are experiencing varied fortunes. The strong performance of the Nasdaq , heavily weighted towards technology and growth stocks, signals continued investor confidence in this sector, often seen as a bellwether for risk appetite that can sometimes spill over into assets like cryptocurrency. Why the Divergence? Understanding Market Trends What factors contribute to such a divergence among the major indices? Several elements could be at play: Sector Rotation: Investors may be rotating capital between different sectors. Strength in technology (benefiting Nasdaq) might coincide with weakness in areas more dominant in the Dow, such as industrials or financials, perhaps due to shifting economic outlooks or specific corporate news. Interest Rate Expectations: Changing expectations about future interest rate hikes or cuts from the Federal Reserve significantly impact growth stocks (Nasdaq) more than value or industrial stocks (Dow). Hopes for stable or lower rates tend to boost tech valuations. Economic Data: Recent economic reports on inflation, employment, or consumer spending can influence different sectors differently. Strong wage growth, for example, might pressure companies reliant on labor (more common in the Dow) while boosting consumer tech demand (benefiting the Nasdaq). Company-Specific News: Earnings reports or significant news from large constituent companies (like Apple or Microsoft in the Nasdaq/S&P 500, or Boeing or Goldman Sachs in the Dow) can heavily sway their respective indices. Analyzing these factors helps paint a clearer picture of the underlying market trends driving investor sentiment across different parts of the economy. The S&P 500 : A Broader Market View As the benchmark for the broader U.S. equity market, the positive movement in the S&P 500 is particularly noteworthy. Representing the performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States, its gain of 0.72% suggests that while the Dow faced headwinds, a significant portion of the market experienced positive momentum. This index includes a mix of sectors, providing a more diversified snapshot than the Nasdaq’s tech focus or the Dow’s industrial bent. Its upward movement indicates that overall market sentiment, while not uniformly positive, leaned towards optimism, likely fueled by strength in key sectors like technology and communication services. The Tech Story: What Propelled the Nasdaq ? The Nasdaq ‘s impressive 1.58% jump underscores the continued dominance of the technology sector. This index is home to many of the world’s largest and fastest-growing tech companies. Factors contributing to its rise could include: Enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) advancements. Strong performance or positive outlooks from major tech players. Investor preference for growth stocks in anticipation of potential shifts in monetary policy. Given the strong correlation often observed between tech stock performance and the more speculative end of the cryptocurrency market, the Nasdaq’s strength is often watched closely by crypto investors as a potential indicator of broader risk-on sentiment. The Lagging Indicator? Analyzing the Dow Jones Conversely, the 0.64% decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average reflects challenges faced by some of the older, more established industrial and financial companies it comprises. The Dow is a price-weighted index of just 30 large companies, making it susceptible to significant moves in just one or two constituent stocks. Its performance can sometimes reflect concerns about traditional economic sectors, manufacturing, or global trade issues. The divergence between the Dow and the Nasdaq/S&P 500 suggests that while growth and tech remain strong, parts of the traditional economy may be facing pressures or less favorable outlooks from investors. Implications of These Market Trends for Investors What can investors, including those in the crypto space, take away from these mixed signals? Key Insights: Sector Performance Matters: Not all parts of the stock market are moving in lockstep. Understanding which sectors are leading or lagging is vital. Tech Sentiment Remains Strong: The Nasdaq’s rise reinforces the ongoing investor focus on technology and growth. Traditional Economy Faces Headwinds: The Dow’s dip suggests caution in sectors tied more directly to traditional industrial or financial activity. Correlation with Crypto: While not always perfect, the Nasdaq’s performance often provides clues about the risk appetite that also influences cryptocurrency markets. Continued strength in tech could be a positive sign for crypto sentiment. Actionable Insights: Diversification: The mixed market highlights the importance of a diversified portfolio across different asset classes, potentially including stocks and cryptocurrencies, understanding their differing drivers. Watch Economic Data: Pay attention to economic indicators and central bank commentary, as these heavily influence the sectors performing differently. Analyze Specific Sectors: Look beyond the headline index numbers to understand which specific industries or companies are driving the moves. Conclusion: Navigating the Nuance The recent trading session underscores the complex nature of today’s financial markets. The US stock market , as reflected in the mixed closures of the S&P 500 , Nasdaq , and Dow Jones , is not a monolith. Different forces are shaping the performance of various sectors, creating divergent market trends . For investors, particularly those with exposure to dynamic markets like cryptocurrency, staying informed about these nuances is key to making informed decisions. The continued strength in tech signals potential underlying optimism, while the softness in traditional sectors warrants careful observation. As market dynamics evolve, understanding these shifts provides valuable context for navigating both equity and crypto landscapes.

The firm is supported by Tether, Bitfinex, SoftBank, and Cantor Fitzgerald, and it plans to surpass Michael Saylor’s Strategy in Bitcoin per share. Meanwhile, Nasdaq-listed GDC announced plans to raise $300 million to build a crypto treasury, including Bitcoin and the TRUMP token. Despite growing institutional interest, Bitcoin’s price remains range-bound near $104,000. Twenty One Capital Races to Overtake Strategy Tether, the issuer behind the world’s most widely used stablecoin USDT, recently acquired $458.7 million worth of Bitcoin on behalf of Twenty One Capital, which is a Bitcoin investment firm it backs. The purchase was disclosed in a May 13 filing by Cantor Equity Partners with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),and it involved the acquisition of 4,812.2 BTC at an average price of $95,319 per coin. The Bitcoin was transferred into an escrow wallet on May 9. This move brings Twenty One’s total Bitcoin holdings to 36,312 BTC, placing it as the third largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. It trails only behind Strategy, with 568,840 BTC, and Bitcoin mining company MARA Holdings with 48,237 BTC, according to data from BitcoinTreasuries.net . Cantor Equity Partners holds 31,500 BTC on behalf of Twenty One and is also facilitating a SPAC merger that will list the firm under the ticker “XXI” once completed. Top Bitcoin holders (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.net ) Jack Mallers , the CEO of Twenty One and also the head of Strike, confirmed that the company is currently undergoing the merger approval process but did not specify a timeline for its completion. Tether is a majority stakeholder in Twenty One alongside crypto exchange Bitfinex, while Cantor Fitzgerald, a major Wall Street player, is sponsoring the SPAC deal and secured $585 million in funding to support the firm’s Bitcoin acquisition strategy. Additionally, Japanese investment giant SoftBank contributed $900 million to Twenty One, to help boost the firm’s ambitions. In filings that were made in April, Twenty One described its goal to outpace Michael Saylor’s Strategy as the top vehicle for investors seeking capital-efficient Bitcoin exposure. Unlike traditional companies that focus on earnings per share, Twenty One’s key performance metric will be “Bitcoin per share.” Twenty One vs Strategy (Source: SEC ) The company plans to reach 42,000 BTC by launch, with contributions including 23,950 BTC from Tether, 10,500 BTC from SoftBank, and around 7,000 BTC from Bitfinex, which will be converted to equity at $10 per share. After the Bitcoin purchase, Cantor Equity Partners’ share price rose by 5.2% in after-hours trading, although it retreated from its May 2 peak of $59.73 to around $29.84. GDC Joins Bitcoin Treasury Trend GD Culture Group (GDC), a Nasdaq-listed micro-cap company, also recently announced plans to raise up to $300 million to establish a cryptocurrency treasury reserve. The company, alongside its subsidiary AI Catalysis, revealed on May 12 that it entered a common stock purchase agreement with a British Virgin Islands-based entity to sell up to $300 million in common stock. The funds raised will be used to buy Bitcoin and the Official Trump (TRUMP) token as part of its strategy to integrate crypto assets into its treasury operations. GDC stated that this initiative is intended to align the company with the broader decentralization movement and is part of the firm’s ambitions to embrace blockchain-based financial infrastructure. Chairman and CEO Xiaojian Wang said that the move builds on GDC’s strengths in digital innovation and livestreaming e-commerce, while also positioning the company for a blockchain-driven future. GD Culture Group stock price over the past year (Source: Nasdaq ) The announcement was made despite the regulatory challenges facing GDC. The company recently received a Nasdaq noncompliance warning after it reported stockholders’ equity of only $2,643, which was far below the required $2.5 million. GDC was given until May 4 to submit a compliance plan. If accepted, the firm will have up to 180 days from the notification date to regain compliance with Nasdaq’s listing standards. GDC’s announcement also coincides with a major event connected to the TRUMP token, one of the crypto assets the firm plans to acquire. On May 22, the top 25 holders of TRUMP tokens are scheduled to attend a private dinner at the White House. The meme coin project already halted additional purchase considerations for the dinner, and attendees have been asked to undergo background checks. This event attracted a lot of criticism from some US lawmakers and regulatory experts. Senator Cynthia Lummis voiced concerns over the exclusivity of the dinner for top token holders, and also suggested that it raises ethical questions. Legal experts also warned that the Trump family’s increasing involvement in crypto could invite heightened scrutiny from the SEC. Tug of War Continues for Bitcoin Direction Despite all of the interest in Bitcoin from multiple businesses, BTC faced renewed selling pressure as US markets opened on May 13. This also happened despite encouraging inflation data that sent traditional stocks higher. BTC’s price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinMarketCap ) BTC/USD once again dipped below the $104,000 level, with the move defying expectations that lower-than-forecast inflation would boost risk assets. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Consumer Price Index rose just 2.3% year-over-year in April, which was the smallest increase since February of 2021. While the S&P 500 and Nasdaq both responded positively by gaining 0.7% and 1.4% respectively, Bitcoin’s price stayed stagnant. Market analysts pointed out that Bitcoin hovered near key liquidity zones, suggesting a temporary pause in directional momentum. Data from CoinGlass revealed that both upward and downward liquidity clusters were cleared, which prompted trader Daan Crypto Trades to comment that the market was now in a range-bound state with no massive liquidity levels in play. The day before, he predicted a drop to around $102,000, which played out as expected. Crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe added that Bitcoin stalling at current levels is not alarming and explained that a pullback to $97,500–$98,000 will still maintain the broader uptrend toward new all-time highs. Meanwhile, QCP Capital suggested that Bitcoin remains caught between its role as digital gold and as a risk-on asset, which created a lack of clear direction in the short term. They believe the evolving macro environment, shifting from protectionist policies to global trade optimism, could keep BTC trading sideways for now. Despite the immediate price weakness, some voices in the space are still very bullish. Binance CEO Richard Teng pointed to Bitcoin’s strong performance relative to traditional assets, and said that it outpaced gold, the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq since April 2. He also called Bitcoin’s momentum “undeniable.”",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING|USDT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-14 06:00:00

According to a May 13 press release , eToro, alongside existing shareholders, will sell 11.92 million shares at $52 apiece. This is well above the originally marketed range of $46 to $50 and up from the 10 million shares initially planned. The offering gives the company a valuation of about $4.3 billion, or nearly $5 billion on a fully diluted basis. Funds managed by BlackRock indicated interest in buying up to $100 million worth of shares. This marks a significant comeback for the Israel-based firm, which paused IPO plans in April amid market uncertainty following tariff-related policy shifts by President Donald Trump. eToro also previously attempted to go public via a $10.4 billion Special Purpose Acquisition Company deal, which fell through in 2022. Founded in 2007, eToro offers stock and crypto trading, as well as copy trading features. It posted $192 million in net income for 2024, up from $15.3 million the year before, according to its IPO filing . Net contribution rose to $787 million from $557 million over the same period.

The purchase was on behalf of Jack Mallers’ recently launched Bitcoin treasury company, Twenty One Capital. Twenty One Capital, announced in April , is being formed through a collaboration between Tether, Bitfinex, Cantor Fitzgerald, and SoftBank Group, with plans to launch via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) merger with Cantor Equity Partners.

XXI https://t.co/tByVe73j5R — Paolo Ardoino (@paoloardoino) May 13, 2025 Tether’s Treasury Firm Twenty One Capital plans to launch with a substantial treasury of more than 42,000 BTC worth approximately $4.4 billion. Tether and Bitfinex will be the majority owners, with SoftBank holding a minority stake. Under incoming CEO Jack Mallers, who also runs Bitcoin payments firm Strike, the venture aims to raise nearly $600 million through convertible notes and private-equity investments. It intends to offer Bitcoin lending services alongside other financial products. The big Bitcoin buy also comes shortly after Tether reported more than $1 billion in revenue in the first quarter. Tether is among several large companies that have been aggressively scooping up BTC this month. Michael Saylor’s Strategy hoovered up a whopping 13,390 Bitcoin for $1.34 billion while Japanese investment firm Metaplanet added a further 1,241 BTC to its treasury, which surpassed that of El Salvador on May 12. Corporate Buying Outpaces Retail Bitcoin investment firm River reported that businesses were outpacing exchange-traded products, governments, and even individual investors for overall Bitcoin accumulation growth this year. It noted that overall corporate holdings growth so far in 2025 totalled 157,000 BTC, worth more than $16 billion at current prices. Last month, Bitwise reported that at least twelve public companies bought Bitcoin for the first time in Q1 2025, and the amount of BTC held by publicly traded companies rose by 16% for the period. Over the weekend, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju said Strategy had turned Bitcoin into a deflationary asset as it was buying at a faster rate than total miner output, giving the asset a -2.3% annual deflation rate.

Synthetix said in a May 14 blog post that it plans to acquire Derive in a token exchange deal, pricing 1 SNX token to 27 DRV tokens, which would value Derive at around $27 million. The transaction is subject to approval from both the Synthetix and Derive communities, which will take a vote on the proposal, called SIP-415, next week. If approved, the acquisition will combine Derive’s front-end and real-world asset ( RWA ) expertise with Synthetix’s derivatives infrastructure . Derive originally launched as Lyra in 2021, having spun out from the Synthetix ecosystem. Synthetix said the acquisition is part of a broader strategy that includes recent acquisitions of Kwenta and TLX, reflecting ecosystem consolidation. “Reuniting under one banner simplifies our architecture and governance and unlocks the next phase,” Synthetix founder Kain Warwick said. “This is the kids going out to build their own successful startups, and coming back to join the family business.” “This re-acquisition marks the next chapter of vertical reintegration with direct protocol ownership of perps, options, and app chains: all of which already have SNX in their DNA,” Synthetix added on X. Source: Synthetix The announcement names Hyperliquid, Binance, dYdX, and Deribit, which will be acquired by Coinbase , as competitors, underlining Synthetix’s ambitions to rival major crypto derivatives platforms. SNX token mint and lockup To facilitate the acquisition, Ethereum-based Synthetix will issue up to 29.3 million of its self-titled Synthetix ( SNX ) token with a three-month lock-up followed by a nine-month linear vesting. SNX has gained 11.5% on the day to reach $0.94 at the time of writing. Related: Upbit and Bithumb suspend Synthetix token deposits, citing sUSD risks However, like most altcoins, it is massively down from its peak and is down almost 97% from its all-time high of $28.53 in February 2021, according to CoinGecko. Synthetix has also suffered recently as its native stablecoin, sUSD, depegged and fell to a low of $0.68 on April 18. The dollar-pegged asset remains below its peg at $0.93 at the time of writing.

CME Group, the world’s largest derivatives exchange, announced via a post on X that it is preparing to launch futures contracts tied to XRP, adding a new dimension of institutional exposure to the digital asset. The anticipation stems from recent developments on CME’s website, where a beta page referencing XRP futures briefly appeared before being taken down. CME later claimed the page was part of a test environment and does not indicate a finalized product. However, earlier statements and actions from the firm suggest otherwise. Mark your calendars and get ready to expand your crypto portfolio with XRP futures starting May 19. Trade your market view with confidence with CFTC-regulated XRP futures, available in larger- and micro-sized contracts. https://t.co/QKapp7sxi6 pic.twitter.com/Xnys8py1Du — CME Group (@CMEGroup) May 13, 2025 Official Confirmation Follows Industry Leak In April, CME formally acknowledged its intention to add XRP futures , shortly after launching similar products for Solana. This signaled a broader expansion of its digital asset offerings beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. The planned debut of XRP futures follows the March rollout of the first regulated U.S.-based XRP futures contracts by Bitnomial , another Chicago-based derivatives platform. Institutional Adoption Accelerates The timing of CME’s initiative aligns with growing institutional interest in XRP. In July of last year, CME introduced pricing indices for XRP. At the time, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said launching the benchmark reference rate was the first step toward institutional crypto products. This statement is now being viewed as a precursor to the futures product in the final approval stage. The significance of CME’s XRP futures launch goes beyond just the derivatives market. It is increasingly seen as a foundational step in a larger trend toward spot-based XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) . Industry observers have pointed to a potential domino effect, where future products pave the way for more direct investment vehicles. Presently, there are over a dozen ETF applications awaiting approval. These are from major financial institutions such as Bitwise and Franklin Templeton. Price Movement and Market Sentiment The cryptocurrency market is now watching closely to see how XRP will react in the days before and after May 19. As of the latest data from CoinMarketCap, XRP is trading at $2.56. While the 2018 launch of CME’s Bitcoin futures led to a sharp market correction, analysts are divided on whether XRP will experience similar volatility. It’s worth noting that 2025 market dynamics are significantly different from those in 2018. Regulatory clarity has improved , institutional interest in digital assets has expanded, and XRP has gained traction globally, particularly through cross-border payment use cases and court victories. For XRP holders, this development is more than just a new trading instrument. It could represent a key step toward mainstream integration within the U.S. financial system.

Once the deal is complete, the combined company will operate under the American Bitcoin name and trade with the ticker “ABTC.” “ Our vision for American Bitcoin is to create the most investable Bitcoin accumulation platform in the market,” said Eric Trump, Co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer of American Bitcoin. Gryphon is a U.S.-based company focused on entering both bitcoin mining and AI. If all goes as planned, the transaction could be finalized by Q3 2025, with American Bitcoin’s current shareholders expected to own around 98% of the combined company. The leadership team from American Bitcoin will continue to lead the business after the merger. Trump Family Expands Crypto Ambitions The latest move shows how Trump’s family is increasingly leaning towards crypto. After trying with projects like World Liberty Financial and memecoins like TRUMP and MELANIA, they have now turned to large-scale Bitcoin mining and building strategic Bitcoin reserves. Hut 8 Corp., which launched American Bitcoin earlier this year in partnership with Eric Trump, will also benefit from the merger. Their goal is to build the “world’s largest, most efficient pure-play Bitcoin miner”, while also building a strong Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. CEO of Hut 8, Asher Genoot, believes that the move will unlock capital for further growth, while keeping the company’s finances strong, and will also give investors a chance to profit from Bitcoin’s long-term potential. Earlier this year, Dominari Holdings announced a new project called American Data Centers to create computing systems for the AI industry. Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. are also investors in the project, and Eric is also on the advisory board of Dominari Holdings. Although Trump has promised to make the U.S. the crypto capital of the planet, criticisms are increasing as Trump is getting more involved in crypto, which could lead to conflicts of interest, regulatory challenges, and ethical concerns.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|MINING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-14 06:16:55

Without Know Your Customer (KYC) checks, eXch wasn’t your typical crypto exchange. It acted more like an instant swapper, allowing bad actors and cybercriminals to fly under the radar for years. Among its clients was the Lazarus Group. The North Korean state-backed hacking unit thrust eXch into the spotlight back in February, when it used the platform to funnel some of the $1.4 billion it stole from Bybit. When Bybit traced its stolen funds to eXch, it requested assistance — but the platform refused. This led to a fierce discussion over privacy versus security, but ultimately, eXch announced it would close its doors on April 17 ; on April 30, German authorities made it official . But according to security firm TRM Labs, the platform may have continued operating in stealth mode after the takedown. Here’s the rise, fall and afterlife of alleged crypto laundromat eXch. eXch shuts front door, keeps back door unlocked Alongside its shutdown announcement, eXch posted a message claiming it would not facilitate criminal proceeds. The post was removed within hours, and operations quietly resumed — signs of an internal disagreement or perhaps even a calculated attempt to lower visibility, according to TRM. CSAM-related fund flows traced to eXch. Source: TRM Labs German authorities seized eXch’s servers and confiscated 34 million euros ($38 million) in crypto , along with more than eight terabytes of data, effectively dismantling its public-facing infrastructure. Related: North Korean spy slips up, reveals ties in fake job interview “Just like we saw with Garantex rebranding as Grinex , eXch didn’t fully die after the shutdown. It quietly kept servicing a handful of partners via API, which meant laundering activity continued even after the public takedown,” said Jeremiah O’Connor, co-founder and chief technology officer of security firm Trugard. O’Connor added that it’s not unlikely for such platforms to serve loyal customers even after seizures. EXch website visited on May 13. Source: eXch “The people behind eXch.ch took full advantage of operating across multiple countries. The domain was registered through a UK-based provider, listed Switzerland as an admin location, hosted infrastructure in France, and had servers seized in Germany,” O’Connor said. It’s still unclear if eXch will kill its API or come back under a new name. TRM said in the May 2 blog post that the platform’s remaining back-end access continued to provide anonymization infrastructure for threat actors. No KYC, pooled liquidity draws illicit funds to eXch EXch’s origins trace back to 2014, according to “Fantasy,” lead investigator at crypto insurance firm Fairside Network. In an October 2024 investigation , Fantasy identified the platform’s first public appearance as a BitcoinTalk forum account promoting automatic swaps between Bitcoin ( BTC ), Perfect Money and BTC-e vouchers — payment methods commonly associated with high-risk transactions. Fantasy also traced the original Bitcoin wallet tied to eXch and found it was likely funded via BTC-e, the now-defunct crypto exchange shuttered by US authorities in 2017 for its role in laundering criminal proceeds. Fantasy’s forensic research found that the modernized form of eXch emerged in 2022, when its Ethereum hot wallet was first funded. Not long after, it became a hub for prominent crypto drainers. Monkey Drainer — the first known large-scale drainer-as-a-service operator — used eXch before its retirement . Other draining service providers like Pink Drainer and Inferno Drainer also passed funds through the platform, along with several major exploiters. EXch’s modern wallets traced to accounts held at Binance and OKX. Source: Fantasy/MetaSleuth EXch required no identity verification, allowing users to move funds with anonymity. That made it an attractive tool for cybercriminals looking to clean stolen assets. “EXch managed to stay active for years — despite facilitating obvious illicit activity — because there’s still a big gap between what regulators ‘can’ do and how fast technology is moving,” Amit Levin, former investigator at Binance, told Cointelegraph. “In today’s world, anyone can launch a smart contract or run a crypto service from anywhere, often without revealing who they are. And if there’s no registration, no KYC and no one to hold accountable, enforcement becomes close to impossible.” The platform also drew confidence from threat actors by using a pooled liquidity system that blended user deposits and withdrawals, making it difficult for investigators and law enforcement to trace the flow of funds. When eXch knew and did nothing EXch denied laundering funds for North Korean crypto hackers , and in its shutdown notice, it framed the project as an attempt by privacy enthusiasts to “restore balance” in the industry. It criticized Anti-Money Laundering enforcement and condemned companies offering address risk scoring APIs as “parasites” profiting off government fear. “Service providers in the crypto space are, for the most part, not decentralized; that is, they retain control over or access to customers’ assets, as demonstrated in the case of eXch,” Gal Arad Cohen, partner at S. Horowitz & Co, told Cointelegraph. “A financial intermediary operating in the crypto sector faces risks similar to those of traditional financial service providers and should, therefore, be held to equivalent standards and regulatory requirements,” she said. The closure of eXch is a “huge win” for crypto, according to Alex Katz, CEO of security firm Kerberus. However, Katz warned that bad actors can migrate to alternative projects, like THORChain, which received a shoutout in eXch’s unapologetic farewell manifesto. In the Bybit hack, decentralized swap protocol THORChain was used as the main bridge to swap around 500,000 Ether ( ETH ) to Bitcoin. EXch operators also used THORChain to allegedly obfuscate trails. Source: Tanuki42 EXch stated that its partners would retain access to its API for a limited time, but future operations would depend on the “new management team.” The old team recommended setting up new liquidity pools to maintain seamless functionality and said it would provide consultations. It signed off with a defiant message: “Privacy is not a crime.” German authorities reported that $1.9 billion in crypto flowed into eXch since its inception. Its operators are suspected of commercial money laundering and running a criminal trading platform.

The venture research firm said in its May 14 Crypto VC Trends report for Q1 that 405 deals were made in the quarter, down 39.5% from the 670 deals made in Q1 2024, but slightly up from the 372 made in Q4 last year. However, the total value of deals in Q1 more than doubled from a year ago, jumping to $6 billion compared to $2.6 billion in the first quarter of 2024 and doubling from $3 billion in Q4 2024. PitchBook's senior crypto research analyst Robert Le said that despite macroeconomic turmoil over the quarter, “capital continued to seek crypto’s core utility rails.” VCs poured nearly $2.55 billion across 16 deals into businesses like crypto asset managers , exchanges, and financial services at a rate that far surpassed any other segment. Crypto infrastructure and development firms saw the next largest venture funding, fetching nearly $955 million across 30 deals. Web3-focused companies saw the third-most deals and funding, at 23 and $231.2 million, respectively. Source: PitchBook. Looking ahead, PitchBook’s Le said Circle’s pending initial public offering (IPO) “represents the most important price-discovery event for crypto equity since Coinbase listed in 2021.” If Circle is valued above the rumored $4 billion to $5 billion range, it could show venture investors that business models similar to Circle’s are profitable and sustainable while also providing a clearer benchmark for future exits. “A strong roadshow could therefore crowd in new late-stage capital and reset valuation expectations upward across the payments and infrastructure stack.” Circle has raised $1.18 billion in VC funding to date, according to PitchBook, which estimates a 64% chance that it will go public in the future. “Dollar-denominated settlement remains crypto’s killer application” Le noted that the market value of stablecoins grew 12% over the first quarter, from $202.3 billion to $227.1 billion, even as other cryptocurrencies saw their values fall or stagnate. “In our view, this divergence underscores a growing consensus: Dollar-denominated settlement remains crypto’s killer application, insulated—at least partially— from broader risk-off moves.” Le said PitchBook expected that near-term venture investments could increase, “especially in payment, remittance, and treasury-management startups that directly monetize stablecoin velocity.” Related: Bitcoin builders defend venture capital's role in layer-2 growth Le added that the $1.4 billion Bybit exploit in February — the largest in crypto history — may accelerate institutional demand for real-time proof-of-reserve tooling, improved custody solutions and middleware that simplifies key management. “Startups addressing those vectors should find a more receptive funding environment despite the broader valuation reset,” he added.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. In 2025, tokenized real-world assets are quietly moving from concept to cornerstone, as regulated platforms begin to transform global finance from the inside out. Table of Contents Tokenization meets real-world scale Blending TradeFi legitimacy and digital innovation Purpose-built networks for asset tokenization Who’s building the future of tokenized real assets? Measuring success: Beyond pilot programs Until recently, legal barriers and fragmented technology made tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) seem unattainable. In 2025, a silent revolution is underway. Tokenized real estate projects, commodity pools, and on-chain money markets are no longer just concepts; they’re becoming part of mainstream finance. Consider treating a luxury Dubai home or a US Treasury fund with the same digital convenience as crypto trading, replete with strict compliance and continuous liquidity. It is time to move beyond pilot projects and investigate the platforms that are integrating tokenization into the fabric of global banking. Tokenization meets real-world scale The shift comes when traditional finance reaches its boundaries. Real estate has always been illiquid and opaque, private equity demands large capital investments, and commodity markets rely on middlemen. In response, new blockchain systems are incorporating RWA tokenization straight into traditional banking procedures. These initiatives go from idea to practical reality by including compliance in the design phase and forming collaborations with legacy institutions. You might also like: Tokenization won’t take off without a reality check | Opinion Blending TradeFi legitimacy and digital innovation At the forefront is a platform that blends decades of institutional experience with blockchain’s programmability. MultiBank, supported by a derivatives behemoth operating under VARA in Dubai and licensed in seventeen jurisdictions, tokenizes ultra-luxury homes, allowing for fractional ownership, daily yield payments, and safe custody, all inside a regulated marketplace. Instead of disrupting current channels, it improves them, allowing investors to smoothly transition between traditional financial services and on-chain assets. In addition, one established digital-securities provider has used its status as a registered broker-dealer, transfer agent, and alternative trading system (ATS) to put private equity funds on-chain. This provider has made institutional-grade fund vehicles more accessible to a wider range of investors by decreasing minimum investment limits from millions to tens of thousands. The platform’s compliance-first strategy enables tokenized funds for top asset managers, demonstrating how regulatory integration may provide a competitive advantage. Purpose-built networks for asset tokenization Not all platforms rely on the current financial infrastructure. One team has created a high-throughput proof-of-work blockchain with money-market instruments backed by US Treasuries. Its unique consensus methodology is intended to accommodate tens of thousands of transactions per second, enabling a decentralized money-market fund with typical returns. Another network chose a bespoke Layer-1 architecture focused entirely on real-world banking. It hosts tokenized commodities, such as gold, as well as ESG-linked assets, thanks to strategic backing from leading digital asset investors. Asset passports offer legal enforceability, while multi-party computation methods enable institutional custody. This solution demonstrates how customized blockchains may handle the stringent requirements of regulated markets while maintaining DeFi’s composability. You might also like: Trailblazer in tokenization: MENA emerges as a highly promising player in the space | Opinion Who’s building the future of tokenized real assets? The rising credibility of real-world asset (RWA) tokenization in 2025 is largely due to the groundwork laid by various infrastructure-focused companies operating in multiple countries and sectors. Securitize is a digital securities business established in the United States that operates as a licensed broker-dealer, transfer agent, and alternative trading system (ATS). The firm focuses on allowing private market funds to be launched and exchanged on-chain while adhering to securities legislation. Securitize’s partnerships with companies such as BlackRock and Hamilton Lane have enabled institutional-grade assets to reach new investor groups. MultiBank Group , through its regulated subsidiary MEX Digital, adds traditional financial expertise to blockchain technology. Its cooperation with MAG, a luxury real estate developer, and Mavryk Labs, a web3 tech business, is one of the greatest efforts to tokenize premium real estate using a regulatory-first strategy. Plume Network presents itself as a Layer 1 network created specifically for RWA tokenization. Unlike general-purpose blockchains, Plume incorporates RWA tools at the protocol layer to handle tokenized commodities, carbon credits, and other physical assets. Its testnet traction and institutional alliances indicate a rising interest in vertically integrated ecosystems. Quai Network’s Proof-of-Entropy-Minima (PoEM) concept provides new improvements at the consensus layer, allowing for high throughput without losing decentralization. Its collaboration with Frictionless Markets brings regulated financial products into the digital asset arena, such as US Treasury-backed tokens and energy swaps, pointing to future-ready money markets. T-RIZE Group , established in Canada, uses tokenization for large-scale building and infrastructure projects. Working via registered broker-dealers, the business uses blockchain to simplify previously illiquid industries such as residential construction, while also investigating ESG-linked securities like tokenized carbon credits. Measuring success: Beyond pilot programs The true evidence of RWA tokenization is not in announcements but in measures like secondary-market trading volumes, audit transparency, and cross-chain interoperability. As platforms show consistent transaction volume, regulatory filings, and institutional engagement, the industry’s narrative moves from speculative promise to operational durability. These projects are not just tokenizing assets but also building the infrastructure for tomorrow’s global markets by incorporating compliance into platform architecture and collaborating with major financial institutions. In 2025, the silent acceptance of institutional-grade RWA tokenization indicates that blockchain is poised to serve as the foundation of real-world finance.

Recent developments like Phantom integration, NFT partnerships, and institutional inflows signal growing adoption. Technical analysis shows bullish EMA alignment, but RSI near 68 hints at potential consolidation. On-chain metrics such as $2.18B TVL and $11B+ monthly DEX volume reflect record activity and sustained DeFi momentum. SUI is consolidating near $4, following a brief intraday pullback on May 13, while maintaining bullish structure overall. SUI Coin has surged 75% over the past month, reclaiming $4 for the first time since February. Backed by record on-chain metrics and strong technicals, the altcoin holds a bullish structure as traders eye a breakout toward the $5.30 ATH. Catalysts Behind SUI’s Momentum Phantom Wallet Integration (May 13): The popular multichain wallet added support for the Sui Network, allowing users to seamlessly swap assets between Sui, Ethereum, Solana, and Base. This expanded access and simplified token purchases directly from the wallet, enhancing user adoption and activity across the ecosystem. Axelar Bridge Launch (May 8): Axelar integrated Sui via its Interchain Token Service (ITS), enabling native assets to be bridged to and from other major blockchains. This boosted Sui’s DeFi composability, allowing protocols to tap into external liquidity while remaining native to the Sui chain. Upcoming Sui Odyssey Event (May 17): The fifth edition of “The Great Sui Odyssey” will take place in Vietnam, spotlighting new developments in AI, DeFi, and gaming — all of which could act as forward-looking catalysts for continued growth. On-Chain Data Confirms Explosive Growth in SUI Ecosystem TVL grew from ~$1.8B in early April to $2.183B by May 14. The stablecoin market cap stands near $919M with inflows up 39.5%. If it crosses $1B, price could trend toward $4.50 under current dynamics. Monthly DEX volume peaked at $782M on April 23 — the highest single-day volume in Sui’s history — within a broader monthly surge. As of May 14, the 7-day total sits above $3.98B, up nearly 40% week-over-week and nearly triple April 10’s $253M figure. Futures open interest surged from ~$600M in early April to $1.86B by May 14 — a yearly high — showing strong leveraged demand across Binance, Bybit, and others. Sui has consistently maintained over 1.5 million daily active addresses through April and May, peaking at 1.7 million on April 29. On average, 1.2M–1.5M wallets interact daily, with a healthy mix of new and returning users. SUI/USD Approaches Key Resistance After 140% Rally SUI price has gained over 140% from its April 13 low of $1.73, reaching $4.20 on May 10 — the first time it reclaimed $4 since January 17, 2025. The rally gained momentum after breaking out of the $2.80–$3.10 consolidation zone on April 23. Notably, this breakout coincided with SUI’s DEX volume all-time high of $782M — confirming the strength behind the price surge. Price currently trades above all major EMAs, with the 20 EMA (~$3.58) providing near-term dynamic support. The $3.53–$3.85 region is acting as a structural base. SUI is consolidating between $3.85 and $4.15 — a former January supply zone — with visible buying support on pullbacks. A daily close above $4.35 would confirm breakout continuation and likely target the $5.30 ATH ( Dec 20, 2024). RSI is holding near 68.2 — slightly below overbought — suggesting slowing bullish momentum but no breakdown yet. Key support zones include $3.53 (20 EMA) and $3.10–$3.20 (aligned with 50 EMA and April breakout base). Can SUI Break $5.30 This Quarter? Metrics Remains Bullish SUI’s bullish structure is reinforced not just by technical strength, but by fundamental catalysts like Phantom wallet integration, Axelar cross-chain support, and institutional inflows. SUI’s structure remains bullish, supported by rising volume, strong on-chain data, and active user growth. A close above $4.35 could trigger a breakout in the next 2–3 weeks.

44600176,https://cointelegraph.com/news/alarm-bells-us-openai-world-privacy-concerns,1747206704,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png,Alarm bells ring in US over OpenAI’s crypto project World,https://cointelegraph.com/news/alarm-bells-us-openai-world-privacy-concerns?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"World Network, the digital identity and crypto project of Sam Altman’s OpenAI, has alarmed privacy activists ahead of its United States launch, with observers concerned over its data collection and protection practices. World “is the opposite of privacy. It’s a trap,” said Nick Almond, CEO of FactoryDAO, on X. While the project claims to protect user privacy in the age of proliferating AI, it’s faced a slew of regulatory concerns across the globe. Formerly known as “Worldcoin,” the iris-scanning technology and its crypto token payout scheme are being probed by authorities in India, South Korea, Italy, Colombia, Argentina, Portugal, Kenya and Indonesia. In Spain, Hong Kong and Brazil, it’s outright banned. World’s latest foray into the US could prove to be CEO Sam Altman’s biggest challenge yet, where privacy concerns are heightened by a patchwork of enforcement that differs state by state. Varying privacy laws could leave World users open to discrimination On April 30, Altman announced that World would set up in “key innovation hubs” in five states in the US: Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville and San Francisco. Would-be verified humans can scan their irises at these hubs, giving World unique biomedical markers. These markers, per World, can be used to prove one’s humanness when interacting with others on digital platforms. But as World expands into the US, an uncertain regulatory landscape could put people off and make it difficult for the platform to build user trust. Andrew Rossow, a cyber and public affairs attorney at Rossow Law, told Cointelegraph, “There is no comprehensive federal law specifically regulating biometric data (such as iris scans) in the US.” Indeed, laws differ state by state. Two states in which World will operate, Texas and California, have some form of legal protections on the books for biometric data. Users in the remaining three states, Georgia, Tennessee and Florida, must rely on federal law, which requires that “companies must be transparent and fair, but there are no special state rules for iris scans.” But even the existence of state law is no guarantee of protection. In Texas, there is no private right of action for biometric data — only the state attorney general (AG) can enforce the state’s Capture or Use of Biometric Identifier law. Altman announced World’s foray into the US market at a company event two weeks ago. Source: World “The effectiveness of user data protections, as it pertains to World, hinges almost entirely on the Texas AG’s priorities, resources and willingness to act,” said Rossow. A more aggressive AG could mean more robust protections, while “a less aggressive administration could deprioritize enforcement, which leaves consumers open and vulnerable to exploitation.” The potential for exploitation is one of the key factors driving activist efforts against systems like World. Privacy International, a privacy protection group that supported legal action in Kenya against World, states that in “the absence of strong legal frameworks and strict safeguards, biometric technologies pose grave threats to privacy and personal security, as their application can be broadened to facilitate discrimination, profiling and mass surveillance.” Related: Over 70 crypto firms join forces to tackle Big Tech’s AI monopoly As far back as 2021, Amnesty International had raised concerns over discrimination and biometric systems’ applications of dubious methodologies. Such systems, they said, can “make inferences and predictions about things such as people’s gender, emotions, or other personal attributes, suffer from serious, fundamental flaws in their scientific underpinnings.” “This means that the inferences they make about us are often invalid, in some cases even operationalizing eugenicist theories of phrenology and physiognomy.” Not everyone is convinced of privacy watchdogs’ concerns. Tomasz Stańczak, co-executive director at the Ethereum Foundation, said that he has spent “over 100 hours” analyzing World, which is building on the Ethereum network. He added that it “looked very promising and much more robust and privacy-focused than my initial intuition.” Paul Dylan-Ennis, an Ethereum researcher and academic, said that he believes World’s tech “is likely strong in privacy terms” but admitted that the aesthetic could be putting people off: “Just some intangible Black Mirror-ness to it all.” Worldcoin faces mounting bans worldwide OpenAI may be doubling down on an American strategy, but other jurisdictions around the world are increasingly investigating, limiting or outright banning the firm’s activities. In 2023, regulators in India, South Korea, Kenya, Germany and Brazil began investigating the firm’s data collection practices. Spain became the first country to ban World data collection outright in March 2024. Related: North Korean spy slips up, reveals ties in fake job interview The Spanish Data Protection Agency previously told Cointelegraph that its course of action was based on reports from Spanish citizens. It claimed that Orb operators provided “insufficient information, collected data from minors and even failed to allow withdrawal of consent.” Following the ban, World published a blog post stating that it operates “lawfully in all of the locations in which it is available.” World has recently made its iris-scanning orbs more compact and transportable. Source: World Global regulators disagreed. Hong Kong followed Spain in May 2024 and ordered World to cease operations as it was allegedly violating the city-state’s Personal Data Privacy Ordinance. Further accusations of improper data collection practices followed, and a number of countries like Germany and, more recently, Kenya, have ordered World to delete the data of thousands of users, while Colombia and Argentina have issued hefty fines. In January 2025, Brazil’s National Data Protection Authority banned World outright , citing concern over the irreversible nature of data collection and the potential for World to influence economically disadvantaged people with the promise of crypto for their data. Opportunities in Japan and the US Despite protestations in various countries, the ID system is making inroads. In Japan, World is now a part of dating online. Spencer Rascoff, CEO of Match Group, which includes dating app Tinder in its portfolio, announced on May 1 that Tinder would be trialing World’s ID system on Tinder in Japan, “giving users a privacy-first way to prove they’re real humans.” Tinder users in Japan can swipe right with World ID-verified users. Source: World The integration in Japan is yet to take off, but as Tinder is the most popular dating app in Japan, it provides a major use case for the World identity platform. In 2024 alone, it had some 1.38 million downloads. If World could score a Tinder partnership in the US, it would acquire 7.8 million monthly active members overnight. If it expanded to similar services like Bumble or Hinge — the next two most popular dating apps in the country — World will have captured 67% of the US online dating market, comprising the personal, unique identities of tens of millions of users. But privacy rights in the US are far from settled. In Texas, one of the states where World plans to operate, Google recently settled to the tune of $1.4 billion. The company paid the eye-watering sum to the state of Texas after settling two lawsuits alleging the firm of tracking user search and location data, as well as collecting facial recognition information. Elsewhere, in Illinois and New York, biometrics firms face court proceedings, while lawmakers take measures to curtail the collection of biometric data.

No cuts in June, no cuts in July. We believe that’s the central bank’s position after watching the joint statement issued on Monday by the United States and China, were both countries claimed they want to ease off trade tensions. As soon as that was announced, major Wall Street banks and traders dropped their expectations for a quick rate cut. They’re now saying the first one might not even come until September, and even then, only if things actually get worse. You see, Trump has revived employment and Wall Street, so the economy isn’t in trouble, and inflation hasn’t cooled enough for anyone at the Fed to start handing out cheaper credit. Traders step back as yields jump and risk appetite grows Traders who were betting on three rate cuts this year have backed off. Now the market is pricing in just two cuts for 2025, with swap contracts showing the Fed might only drop rates by 55 basis points, instead of the 75 they expected just last Friday. That adjustment alone rattled the bond market. The two-year Treasury yield, which always reacts to moves from the Fed, jumped 12 basis points on Monday, pushing back above 4%. That spike came after investors realized the central bank isn’t going to act just because Wall Street wants it to. The drop in rate-cut bets also made US Treasuries less attractive. Stocks, on the other hand, went up. So the money started chasing risk again. Since last week’s Fed meeting, where they decided to do nothing, yields have gone up fast. The two-year yield climbed more than 40 basis points, from 3.55% to over 4%. The five-year yield also moved, going from 3.85% to 4.11%. That’s a clear message from the bond market: no more easy money, at least for now. Jerome Powell, the Fed Chair, told reporters that the central bank is watching how new trade policies affect inflation and growth before doing anything. He made it clear there’s nothing in the data that shows the economy is falling apart. Powell ignores Trump’s pressure, stays focused on inflation Even with the market cooling off, president Donald Trump wants action. Just yesterday, the president posted on Truth Social, calling for lower rates. But as usual, he is living in his own unique set of data. Trump said : “No Inflation, and Prices of Gasoline, Energy, Groceries, and practically everything else, are DOWN!!! THE FED must lower the RATE, like Europe and China have done. What is wrong with Too Late Powell? Not fair to America, which is ready to blossom? Just let it all happen, it will be a beautiful thing!” Admittedly, there was a drop in prices for some things, like food and energy, which have been sliding due to higher oil production and weaker global growth. April prices in those areas fell compared to March. But overall inflation, even though it’s way down from its peak, is still higher than the Fed’s 2% target. That’s why they’re not rushing. Jake Dollarhide, CEO of Longbow Asset Management, said, “There’s been a fear that tariffs are going to push inflation higher, and they may still, but today’s data at least gives investors a sense of relief that inflation is still moving in the right direction.” But Raymond James economists aren’t convinced it’s time to cut. They wrote that ongoing uncertainty around tariff policies and how they’ll affect inflation is enough to keep the Fed from making any moves. The risk is simple: cut too early, and inflation might come back even stronger. Fed officials believe lowering rates before inflation is under control is a dangerous move. It could lead to even more price increases, and that would drag down real economic growth. Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY, said their team had to change their own forecast. “With little clarity on the final status quo for trade policy and Fed policymakers unlikely to preempt any growth or inflation developments, we now only anticipate two Fed rate cuts (instead of three), and believe the first rate cut will come in September (instead of July),” he said .",OP-ED|Federal Reserve|USD,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-14 07:16:29

According to a May 13 post on the Bitfinex Alpha blog, the realized market cap of Bitcoin ( BTC ) has reached $889 billion after rising 2.1% in the past 30 days. The realized cap values each coin at the price at which it was last moved, unlike the regular market cap, which multiplies the current price by the total supply. This approach better captures ongoing buying interest and more accurately represents the actual capital that has entered the market. Spot exchange-traded funds activity reflects that inflow. Net inflows into Bitcoin ETFs have exceeded $920 million over the last two weeks, indicating strong institutional interest. Meanwhile, on-chain data shows taht the number of coins held at a loss has drastically decreased, and over 3 million BTC have returned to profit territory. These changes suggest that market sentiment has improved and that sell-side pressure has decreased.

Bitfinex analysts credit the rally to a cooling of international trade tensions and the Federal Reserve’s more dovish stance . While broader risk markets have responded favorably to this macro backdrop, Bitcoin has outperformed equities, further confirming its status as a high-conviction asset for many investors. On the policy front, the U.S. continues to struggle with digital asset legislation. A key crypto bill, the Genius Act, failed in the Senate by a narrow vote, reflecting continued division on how to regulate the space. States like New Hampshire, on the other hand, are making progress with new legislation that permits investment in digital assets like Bitcoin. All things considered, Bitcoin’s increasing realized cap and growing institutional presence suggest that this rally has deeper roots than many others and may still have room to grow.

With a favorable market and potential positive developments in its ongoing ETF speculation, XRP is primed for a breakout. However, an emerging altcoin is quickly stealing the spotlight. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is generating buzz with its impressive projections, with experts forecasting a staggering 12,400% surge by Q4 2025. The project is in phase 4 of its presale, has already attracted over 9800 investors and raised more than $8.1 million. The clock is ticking, and early movers may never see a window like this again, since Over 70% of the phase has already been sold out. As investors diversify their portfolios, many are starting to question whether Mutuum Finance might offer even greater returns than established tokens like XRP in the coming years. The Mutuum Finance team has recently unveiled a new dashboard with a leaderboard that ranks the top 50 holders, who will be rewarded with bonus tokens for staying in the top 50 positions. Ripple (XRP) Set for Strong Rally: Will It Hit New Heights in 2025? It is at this time that Ripple (XRP) is currently experiencing a wave of optimism as it chases after a new High Mark, with the experts predicting this coin might cross the $4.50 mark in the next three weeks. The anticipation of this potential rally occurs as the digital currency witnesses greater utilization within the financial circles and a positive sentiment in the market as Bitcoin climbs. XRP’s appeal is its ability in terms of being a bridge currency for cross border payments for which it stands out from its peer XLM making it an ideal choice to hold by institutional players. As the market starts to recover, Ripple’s plan for 2025 indicates that they will be continuing to grow which makes them one of the biggest players in the altcoin race. However, while XRP’s prospects look bright, new tokens such as Mutuum Finance are also making waves owing to their huge upside potential. Mutuum Finance Presale Takes Off Mutuum Finance has taken the DeFi market by storm because of its innovative crypto lending approach which has gained fast momentum. More than 9800 investors have participated in the project’s unique presale through which they have poured $8.1 million of capital.

The decentralized finance sector keeps expanding while Mutuum Finance emerges as the leading pioneer which brings innovative lending strategies and solid market leadership. Shaking Up Crypto Lending through a Dual-Model Approach Mutuum Finance is redefining crypto lending by interweaving two dominant models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). The P2C model allows users to contribute stablecoins to liquidity pools managed by smart contracts, earning passive income with instant borrowing availability for platform players. Even interest rates are adjusted automatically by the smart contracts to maximize lenders’ returns and lower borrowing costs. The P2P model takes decentralization to the level of eliminating third parties, allowing borrowers and lenders to directly interact. This provides users with the option to negotiate individualized loan agreements, facilitating higher transparency and an intuitive borrowing experience. XRP is set to hit $4.50 soon, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the real game-changer, with projections for a 12,400% surge by Q4 2025.

For enthusiasts within the Solana community, the introduction of JTO marks a significant event, as it empowers users to govern one of the network’s largest liquid staking protocols. Undoubtedly, those engaged with the protocol will be keenly interested in the token. Another critical factor influencing predictions for Jito’s price in 2025 is the progress of the Jito protocol itself. While there’s no specific roadmap to anticipate upcoming enhancements, unveiling a future roadmap or declaration of forthcoming developments could significantly boost interest in the token. Why is the JTO up today? JTO’s price gained strong buying demand around the low of $1.9. As a result, buyers gained confidence and pushed the price above $2.1. Will JTO price recover? If buyers hold above the $2 level, we might see a continuation of the current upward trend. Will JTO reach $10? JTO price might reach the $10 mark in 2025 if buying demand surges and Jito attracts altcoin investors. However, our JTO price prediction states it might reach the $10 level by 2026. Will the JTO price reach $100? Due to the effort of the Solana community, JITO Coin’s prices will continue to increase. However, there is no indication that the JITO (JTO) Coin will reach $100 soon, which is a short-term target. Is JTO a good long-term investment?

In a recent post on X , he shares his altcoin portfolio, trading strategy, and macro insights, offering valuable perspectives for investors. Altcoins are waking up $ETH broke $2,500. $SOL hit $180. $PEPE doubled in a month. But it’s not time to ape into low caps just yet. Here are the 6 altcoins I’m trading this week, and what this early stage of the bull market tells us about what’s coming next — VirtualBacon (@VirtualBacon0x) May 13, 2025 Altcoin Market Analysis Typically, an altcoin rally follows a simple pattern: Bitcoin triggers the market , followed by Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), and finally, large-cap cryptos shift focus to small caps and meme coins. According to VirtualBacon, the market is currently in the large-cap breakout phase of the latest altcoin season. Since April 1, the altcoin market has grown by at least 27.23%. Ethereum surged by 47.04%, and Solana by 46.73%. Smaller altcoins like PEPE, TAO, and SUPER saw significant growth, with each reporting a rise of at least 40%. Key Factors Driving the Altcoin Trend A critical factor in the current altcoin rally is the temporary halt of the US-China tariff war for 90 days, reducing market volatility and boosting liquidity. VirtualBacon highlights that the Global Liquidity Index recently posted its first higher high since 2021, a key indicator for an altcoin season. Not Full Altcoin Season Yet Despite the positive momentum, VirtualBacon cautions that the market has not fully entered an altcoin season. He points out that until the US Federal Reserve pauses Quantitative Tightening (QT), the current altcoin rally remains a relief rally, not a full-fledged altseason. Top Altcoins to Watch Ethereum & Solana Ethereum and Solana are recommended for their strong fundamentals, with Ethereum surging by 64.5% and Solana by 37.7% in the past 30 days. L1 Exposure VirtualBacon suggests ALGO and IOTA as alternatives to XRP, with ALGO praised for its low price , liquidity, and tokenomics, while IOTA is highlighted for its new Move-based L1 and mainnet. Solana Ecosystem JUP stands out as a dominant player in the Solana ecosystem , with BORG (Mobile DEX) and SAROS (DLMM platform) emerging as promising projects. Gaming Sector SUPER is recommended for its consistency and long-term potential, especially with upcoming staker rewards for the community. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Trump-Backed American Bitcoin Set to Go Public in 2025 , AI Sector TAO is compared to Bitcoin in the AI crypto space, with the token showing a 2x rise from its low, following its recent subnet launch and token upgrades.

Over the past week, Ethereum has surged approximately 42%, breaking a 22-week downtrend, while Bitcoin (BTC) remains steady around $105,000. ETF flows reveal contrasting investor behavior: Bitcoin ETFs saw $867 million inflows compared to $1.5 million for Ethereum, yet Ethereum's price performance outpaced Bitcoin's. BlackRock has been a consistent net buyer of Bitcoin ETFs for 20 consecutive trading days, while Ethereum ETFs have experienced net outflows, except for some institutional interest from Hong Kong. Notably, 76,800 ETH were transferred to Binance Beacon, and 324,000 ETH were withdrawn from exchanges with over 180,000 ETH moved into staking, indicating a shift toward long-term holding. In the last 24 hours, Ethereum ETFs recorded inflows of $13.37 million, contrasted by Bitcoin ETF outflows of $96.14 million. Additionally, Abraxis borrowed $240 million USDT to stake 211,000 ETH, and a whale transaction exchanged 200 wrapped BTC for 7,900 ETH. The recent Ethereum price rally has been supported by real spot demand and developments such as the Pectra upgrade, contributing to increased ETH trading volume surpassing Bitcoin's.

But analysts are unfazed by the pullback. Historically, such corrections are natural after rallies, and Pi still remains up 59% over the last month. While Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana continue to dominate conversations, Pi Network is carving out a niche with its mobile mining app and decentralized Pi browser, aiming to bring real-world utility and mass adoption closer to reality. However, Pi’s year-to-date performance tells a different story. After institutional investors initially pumped massive amounts into Pi Network, its price sharply declined. But since bottoming out at around $0.40, Pi has climbed back to nearly $1.20, breaking through major resistance levels and moving averages. Where Is Pi Network Headed Next? Technical analysts have identified a parallel channel pattern forming on Pi’s chart. If the token breaks out of this formation, the price could surge another 234%, potentially reaching $5.27 per token. That would equate to a market cap of roughly $39 billion — putting it in the same league as other established projects. As of May 14, 2025, at 13:00, a total of 5.17 billion Pi tokens — valued at approximately $6.19 billion — are currently locked. Over the next 30 days, around 265.44 million Pi (worth about $317.92 million) are scheduled to be unlocked, which accounts for 5.13% of the total locked supply. On average, about 8.85 million Pi tokens (equivalent to $10.6 million) will be unlocked daily. The highest single-day unlock is expected on May 16, with approximately 14.75 million Pi tokens — valued at $17.67 million — set to be released. This upcoming unlock activity could lead to increased price volatility in the Pi market, as a surge in token availability often influences market dynamics and investor sentiment.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-14 07:46:25

According to an announcement shared with Cointelegraph, Mastercard partners can now rely on Kima’s settlement infrastructure to enable their prepaid cards to be topped up with stablecoins, including USDC ( USDC ) and Tether’s USDt ( USDT ), from self-custody wallets across more than 10 blockchains. Kima CEO Eitan Katz said the integration shows that stablecoins can be practical for everyday use, removing friction and intermediaries from crypto-to-fiat conversions while expanding crypto usability. “Our goal at Kima is to eliminate barriers between digital assets and traditional finance,” Katz said. Related: Mastercard tokenized 30% of its transactions in 2024 Infrastructure designed for interoperability Katz described Kima’s settlement system as asset-agnostic and designed to simplify cross-ecosystem payments, supporting public blockchains, private ledgers and traditional banking rails: “Kima’s asset-agnostic settlement layer is designed to abstract the complexity of transferring value across disparate ecosystems, whether that’s public blockchains, private ledgers, or even traditional banking systems.” According to the announcement, Kima’s infrastructure is aligned with Mastercard’s aim to bring stablecoins into mainstream financial usage. Katz rejects the Bitcoin and crypto hardliner vision of digital assets being contraposed to fiat currency, claiming that “crypto and fiat must coexist seamlessly to reach their full potential.” Katz explained that Kima’s solution allows easy crosschain interoperability and eliminates reliance on intermediaries, custodians or complex smart contracts. This, in turn, reportedly enhances security and efficiency for all parties involved. Related: Mastercard links with Circle, Paxos for merchant stablecoin payments ECB includes Kima in digital euro initiative Earlier in May, the European Central Bank (ECB) included Kima in a list of 70 private sector partners tasked with helping in digital euro innovation. The firms on the list have signed up to work with the ECB to explore digital euro payment functionalities and use cases. “The breadth and creativity of the proposals highlights the digital euro’s potential as a catalyst for financial innovation in Europe,” ECB executive board member Piero Cipollone said at the time. Source: Kima Despite Kima’s institutional partnerships, Katz told Cointelegraph that “compliance shouldn’t mean giving up control of your funds or your data.” He said that know-your-client and Anti-Money Laundering checks are handled by third-party banks and virtual asset service providers at onboarding, and Kima never has access to the data. Katz added that “once a user is cleared, every transaction carries immutable metadata tags that our protocol-level engine checks against local rules.” This, he said, covers compliance “from the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation to Singapore’s regulatory guidelines — before settlement.” Katz said that “keys are kept entirely under the users’ control,” while cryptographic proofs still allow for compliance. “Institutions get a plug-and-play control layer and users enjoy true self-custody,” Katz added.

Although the Bitcoin price is rising with some margin, the Ethereum price has been outperforming in terms of daily gains. Currently, the token has recorded more than a 12% jump compared 4% to 5% jump of Bitcoin. WIth this, the ETH price has reached one of the important resistance zones, breaking which, the token could become one of the top gainers for the month. Besides, the institutional interest in Ethereum is on the rise. The recent data shows the institutions sold nearly 889 BTC but bought 5,410 ETH during the last trading day. Along with this, the ETH inflows into accumulation addresses have spiked to insane levels. This hints that the big players may be aware of more things, which has raised their interest despite the sideways trend of the ETH price. As mentioned above, the ETH price has been in a slump for quite a long time, which dropped the interest among the retail traders. As a result, they sold off their holdings, which have now been accumulated by the institutions. Moreover, after the recent Pectra upgrade, the burn rates have been on the rise, which is a huge bullish signal for the crypto. What’s next? How high will the ETH price go in May 2025? The weekly chart of ETH price suggests the token is approaching the edge of the prolonged consolidation and hence a breakout from the accumulated zone is expected to kick-start a strong bull run. Two main indicators are set to undergo a bullish crossover shortly, which may confirm the start of a strong upswing: the Ichimoku Cloud and DMI. On the other hand, the token is consolidating between the 50- and 200-day MAs, which are acting as strong support and resistance levels. As the price in the weekly chart has never faced a death cross, the well-positioned price range between these MAs suggests the possibility of a rebound. The Ethereum price is working hard to surpass the pivotal resistance at $2,800, which could transform into a strong base preventing any major correction. With this, the price is believed to rise and reach the trand reversal zone around $3000 that may further push the token beyond $3,500.",Price Analysis|Ethereum,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-14 07:47:23

The Q-Day Prize is a challenge to make the Bitcoin network quantum resistant. On April 16, 2025, quantum computing-focused company Project 11 announced the “ Q-Day Prize ,” a competition to break a “toy version” of Bitcoin’s cryptography with a quantum computer. Contestants must complete the Q-Day Prize challenge by April 5, 2026. Their reward? 1 Bitcoin ( BTC ). The “Q” in Q-Day refers to quantum computing , the potential threat to many existing cryptographic security measures. But can quantum computers break Bitcoin? Let’s find out. Quantum computing and the threat to Bitcoin Bitcoin utilizes the SHA-256 hashing algorithm , a National Security Agency (NSA)-developed encryption algorithm. SHA-256 prevents brute force attacks against the Bitcoin network, as decrypting it with current hardware can take decades. However, the emerging threat to SHA-256 is quantum computing , a method of computing that harnesses quantum physics and is much faster than traditional computing. At a fundamental level, quantum computing utilizes quantum bits (qubits), which can exist in multiple states. This contradicts binary (traditional) computing, which uses binary bits (1s and 0s). In 1994, mathematician Peter Shor presented an algorithm for quantum computers to solve complex algorithms in seconds, rather than the decades it can take for conventional hardware. At the time, no hardware could effectively run it, but recent advances like Google Willow are nearing that capability. Quantum computing, when paired with Shor’s algorithm, can disrupt Bitcoin cryptographic systems as we know them. Shor’s algorithm allows quantum computers to solve complex math super fast, potentially threatening Bitcoin’s safety. Did you know? If quantum tech gets strong enough, Bitcoin’s current security could become obsolete, so developers are racing to create “quantum-proof” shields using new math that even Shor’s algorithm can’t break. Quantum threat to Bitcoin: How real is the danger? Bitcoin is vulnerable to quantum computing, but how serious is the risk? When you create a crypto wallet , it generates two important things: a private key and a public key . The private key is a secret code, like a password, that you must keep safe. The public key is created from your private key, and your wallet address (like a bank account number) is made from the public key. You share your wallet address with others so they can send you cryptocurrency, just like you share your email address for someone to contact you. However, you never share your private key. It’s like the password to your email — only you need it to access and spend the money in your wallet. Your private key is like a master password that controls your crypto wallet. From this private key, your wallet can create many public keys, and each public key generates a wallet address. For example, if you use a hardware wallet , it has one private key but can create unlimited public keys (wallet addresses). This means you can have different addresses for each cryptocurrency supported by the wallet or even multiple addresses for the same cryptocurrency, all managed by a single private key. While generating a public key from a private key is straightforward, figuring out a private key from a public key is extremely hard — almost impossible — which keeps your wallet secure. Every time you send cryptocurrency, your private key creates a special code called a signature. This signature proves you own the funds and want to send them. The system that uses your private key, public key and signature to secure transactions is called the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). It is believed that quantum computing could reverse the process and generate private keys out of public ones. It is feared that this could cause many Bitcoin holders (especially whales and Satoshi-era wallets ) to lose their funds. Bitcoin address types and quantum risks When you send Bitcoin, you use a specific address type to direct the payment. Each address type has unique features, affecting security, privacy and vulnerability to quantum computing attacks like Shor’s algorithm. P2PK address types When you pay someone with Bitcoin, the transaction is typically considered a “pay-to-public-key” (P2PK). This was the most common payment method in 2009, according to a report from consulting firm Deloitte. Much of the original Bitcoin released at the network’s launch is held in wallets with the P2PK address type, primarily due to the fact that they’ve sent transactions since Bitcoin’s 2009 launch. These addresses are long (up to 130 characters), making them less user-friendly. Wallets with the P2PK address type are most susceptible to Shor’s algorithm, as it can brute force the private key from a P2PK wallet address . P2PKH address types There’s a second address type that’s more resistant to Shor’s algorithm: the pay-to-public-key-hash (P2PKH). P2PKH addresses are shorter and are generated from the hash (a unique, hexadecimal value) of a public key created using SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160 algorithms instead of displaying the full key itself. These addresses are shorter (33-34 characters), start with “1,” and are encoded in Base58 format. Such addresses are widely used and include a checksum to prevent typos , making them more reliable. P2PKH addresses are more resistant to Shor’s algorithm than P2PK because the public key is hashed. The public key is only revealed when you spend from the address (not when receiving). If a P2PKH address never sends Bitcoin, its public key stays hidden, offering better protection against quantum attacks. However, reusing a P2PKH address (sending from it multiple times) exposes the public key, increasing vulnerability. Also, when you spend from a P2PKH address, the public key becomes visible on the blockchain, making transactions trackable. Taproot addresses Taproot is the newest address type , introduced in November 2021 via the Taproot soft fork. It uses Schnorr signatures instead of the ECDSA signatures used by P2PK and P2PKH. These addresses start with “bc1p,” use Bech32m encoding, and are 62 characters long. They offer better privacy. Multisignature (multisig) transactions look like single-signature ones, hiding complex spending conditions. However, Taproot addresses expose the public key (or a tweaked version), making them vulnerable to Shor’s algorithm, similar to P2PK. Did you know? Google’s “Willow” computer chip is capable of solving a complex problem in just five minutes. The same task would take a classical supercomputer 10 septillion (!) years. The race toward quantum-proofing Bitcoin Quantum resistance is a real challenge, but not an impossible one. Quantum computers, still in early development, could one day use Shor’s algorithm to break Bitcoin’s cryptography by deriving private keys from public keys. This would threaten Bitcoin and other systems using SHA-256 or ECDSA (the algorithms securing Bitcoin transactions). However, this threat is not imminent, and solutions are already in progress. While some believe that Project 11 presented the Q-Day Prize to take down Bitcoin, the company claims this initiative is aimed at “quantum-proofing” the network. In July 2022, the US Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) announced four quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms resulting from a six-year challenge to develop such solutions. Quantum computing won’t develop in isolation, and centralized systems like government and financial networks could be bigger targets than Bitcoin’s decentralized blockchain. These systems use outdated cryptography, like RSA, vulnerable to Shor’s algorithm, and store sensitive data (e.g., banking records). Their single points of failure make breaches easier than attacking Bitcoin’s distributed nodes. The International Monetary Fund warns quantum computers could disrupt mobile banking, while Dr. Michele Mosca from the Institute for Quantum Computing highlights “harvest-now, decrypt-later” risks for centralized data (where attackers store encrypted data today to decrypt with future quantum computers). In 2024, the G7 Cyber Expert Group urged financial institutions to assess quantum risks, noting that centralized systems’ data could be exposed if intercepted now and decrypted later. Did you know? Many blockchain networks are exploring quantum-resistant algorithms, such as Quantum Resistant Ledger or Algorand. These quantum computing blockchain security methods present a few different approaches. How to increase your security against quantum threats While the quantum computing cryptocurrency risk is less of a threat than one might think, it’s still best to stay prepared. Still, if you’re worried about Bitcoin quantum vulnerability , there are a few precautions you can take to secure your crypto finances. Avoid reusing public addresses: Most crypto wallets allow you to generate a new public address for every transaction. This practice will make it much harder to track your spending habits. Move funds to a private wallet: If you’ve been using the same public wallet address for some time, consider moving your funds to a new wallet with no history. This will help keep your spending habits private. Use a different blockchain network: Legacy networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum are considered less quantum resistant than newer networks with more modern security algorithms. Consider alternative networks with quantum resistance in mind. Stay informed: Pay attention to the results of the Q-Day Prize challenge, and stay up to date with quantum computing news so you can react accordingly. The best defense is an informed one. While quantum risk is not immediate, developers and cybersecurity experts are actively working on solutions to ensure long-term security. In the meantime, users should stay updated about Bitcoin protocol updates and best practices, such as avoiding address reuse, as the network gradually moves toward quantum resistance.",Q-Day Prize challenge,EN,0,0,ALGO|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MINING|FORKS,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-14 07:50:00

According to data from crypto.news, Chainlink ( LINK ) was up roughly 6% trading at $17.27 on May 14 afternoon Asian time, extending its rally, which began May 6, as macro conditions eased. It is now up nearly 70% from its lowest level this year, giving the token a market valuation of nearly $11.39 billion. Open interest in LINK has also climbed sharply, reaching $768.65 million, its highest level since March 11, when it stood at $400 million, according to CoinGlass. Rising open interest typically signals increasing trader participation and heightened speculative activity, often seen ahead of major price moves. Data also shows that the altcoin’s weighted funding rate has remained positive for the past 7 days. A positive funding rate basically means that traders going long are paying a small fee to shorts. It’s a sign that more people are leaning bullish and willing to pay up to hold their long positions.

It has now broken above the 50-day moving average, a strong sign that the bulls are gaining ground. LINK price, 50-day EMA and ADX chart — May 14 | Source: crypto.news The token has also formed an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, a classic setup that often signals a trend reversal. The head sits around $10, with the two shoulders near the $16 mark. Adding to the momentum, the Average Directional Index has climbed to 20, indicating that a strong trend is starting to take shape. LINK price 4-hour chart — May14 | Source: crypto.news Zooming into the 4-hour chart, LINK has been trading inside an ascending broadening pattern. If it manages to break above the upper boundary of that channel, it could trigger another leg higher. Based on this setup, the next likely price target for LINK is around $20.95, which would be a 21% gain from current levels. If bullish momentum continues, LINK could push toward its year-to-date high of $27.3 in the coming weeks, further extending gains to 58%. Ecosystem growth supports bullish narrative Momentum on the technical front is also being matched by a series of fundamental catalysts across Chainlink’s ecosystem. New partnerships and protocol-level integrations are positioning Chainlink to capture greater utility, which could amplify demand for LINK in the weeks ahead. Chainlink was recently picked as an official service provider for BNB Chain’s Kickstart Program. That means new projects on BNB Chain can now tap into Chainlink’s tools for data, cross-chain support, and computing, along with direct support from Chainlink Labs and co-marketing exposure. Dolomite, a decentralized margin trading platform, also integrated Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), allowing secure, seamless transfers across Arbitrum, Ethereum, and Berachain. Earlier last week, Chainlink also expanded its footprint with 12 new integrations of the Chainlink standard across six key services, including deployments on eight different blockchains: Gravity Alpha, Monad, NEX Protocol, Polygon, Ronin, Rootstock, Superseed, Taiko, and Zora. Meanwhile, LINK could also benefit from regulatory tailwinds. The U.S. administration is reportedly exploring updates to crypto rules to better accommodate on-chain securities and other digital assets. If clearer regulations come into play, that could unlock a wave of tokenized real-world assets moving on-chain, something Chainlink is well-positioned to support. More demand for tokenization could mean more projects integrating its services, which would naturally boost LINK’s utility and possibly its price. Chainlink is also a made-in-USA cryptocurrency , which could strengthen its appeal as the Trump administration pushes for homegrown blockchain projects.

It asserts RippleNet’s structural dependence on XRP and underscores XRP’s dominance as the principal currency used on its ledger. These claims are supported by data and text drawn from peer-reviewed sources, including a study published by Atlantis Press and a detailed flow analysis of transactions conducted between October 1, 2019, and April 30, 2020. One key excerpt emphasized by SMQKE states: “As one might expect, XRP is by far the most used currency on the ledger in terms of payment volume.” “Ripplenet DEPENDS on XRP.” + “As one might expect, XRP IS BY FAR THE MOST USED CURRENCY ON THE LEDGER IN TERMS OF PAYMENT VOLUME.” Ripple needs XRP. Documented. https://t.co/CPaTNL4ihL pic.twitter.com/2r5bqMDPpO — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) May 12, 2025 According to the referenced research, 125 billion XRP were transacted on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) for seven months, averaging approximately 586 million XRP daily. This quantitative assessment confirms XRP’s overwhelming role as the medium of exchange on its native ledger, far surpassing other IOU tokens or currencies issued by entities on the same network. Transaction Flows Centered Around XRP The graphical representation included in the same study further supports this conclusion. It illustrates the value flow of XRP across major platforms such as Binance, Coinbase, Bitstamp, and Huobi Global, alongside an array of transactions involving other currencies like USD, EUR, CNY, and crypto-assets such as ETH and BTC. The central axis of this flow chart is XRP itself, acting as the predominant currency bridging transactions between senders and receivers. The data reveals that XRP dominates by volume and structural centrality within the transaction architecture. RippleNet’s Systemic Dependence on XRP The second point in SMQKE’s tweet focuses on RippleNet’s operational model. A section from a 2021 analysis published in Advances in Economics, Business and Management Research affirms that “RippleNet depends much on XRP,” noting that XRP usage is intrinsic to RippleNet’s cross-border, real-time payment system. The paper elaborates that as long as Ripple’s global payment infrastructure remains active, XRP will retain a functional role as its medium of value transfer. It also mentions Ripple’s ambition to elevate XRP’s use beyond RippleNet, including a potential role in central bank digital currency systems , referencing a white paper by Ripple expressing this intent. Ongoing Strategic Efforts to Expand XRP’s Utility Further language from the document states that “XRP could become a ‘neutral bridge’ between different currencies,” and that Ripple continues to develop use cases and network configurations that place XRP at the core of its ecosystem. The study distinguishes XRP from other decentralized digital assets by noting that XRP “is totally controlled by Ripple Labs,” underscoring the company’s influence over the asset’s issuance and utility within its broader financial products. In summary, SMQKE’s tweet draws on substantive documentary evidence to reinforce the claim that RippleNet is not merely compatible with XRP but in fact structured around it. The data extracted from transaction records and Ripple’s intentions support the argument that XRP’s role is not peripheral but foundational. From a technological and operational standpoint, XRP continues to serve as the primary vehicle for value movement on the XRPL, with Ripple actively steering its integration into broader institutional frameworks.

Coinbase invites DOGE staffer who dropped out of campus The message quoted a video shared by a conservative supporter’s account that featured a young former Harvard student, Ethan Shaotran, who said he dropped out of the university to join the DOGE initiative. He claimed that his decision left him ostracized by peers and receiving threatening emails. “ I dropped out of Harvard and came here to serve my country. It’s been unfortunate to see lost friendships. Most of the campus hates me now. ” Shaotran continued, “ if there’s one group of people who really have a shot of success, it’s the people here. They’re up until 2 am., Monday through Sunday .” DOGE: Harvard student who dropped out to join the DOGE team admits he’s lost friends and is a pariah on campus now. pic.twitter.com/zvn9RX73Kh — @amuse (@amuse) May 2, 2025 Explaining his choice to leave Harvard, the student said the need for systemic reform for America was more imperative than education. “ I think the value of this and the impact here is so much more vast than anything you could learn in a classroom doing computer science, ” he concluded. One critic on Armstrong’s post asked if the invitation was based on merit. “ Is it merit when a team did a horrible job and instantly gets offered their next job? Or is it nepotism on a political basis? Focus on merit, big man, ” they argued. Another user added, “ The next schism isn’t a political divide, it is a competency divide. Those who value merit, hard work and innovation, and those that do not. ” Coinbase joins S&P 500, replacing Discover Financial The hiring invitation came against the backdrop of some “good news” for Coinbase. The crypto exchange became the newest member of the S&P 500 index, replacing Discover Financial. The inclusion is set to take effect before US markets open on May 19. Coinbase is now the first and only crypto company to be added to the S&P 500, a move Oppenheimer analysts called a “watershed moment” for the industry and increased their price target on Coinbase shares to $293. The financial firm recently reported its first-quarter earnings, which revealed that profits plummeted 94% to $66 million, compared to $1.176 billion in Q1 of the previous year. Yet, revenue rose 23.4% to $1.96 billion from $1.588 billion, Armstrong also shared his optimistic sentiment on social media, predicting that “crypto will be in everyone’s 401k.” “My goal is that in 5–10 years, getting into COIN50 index will feel as good as this,” the CEO reckoned . New asset launch for cbADA, cbDOGE, cbLTC, cbXRP Coinbase also issued an advisory regarding several new token assets, cbADA, cbDOGE, cbLTC, and cbXRP, which are not yet available for trading. The company warned users to be cautious of fraudulent actors claiming the assets are live. “These assets are not yet live or available,” the company stated . “We will announce their launch at a later date.” To prevent scams, Coinbase published the official Base contract addresses for each upcoming token and told the crypto community that any claims of their availability are false, potentially linked to fraudulent schemes.

Announced on May 14 , the plan aims to bolster Synthetix’s reach in the crypto derivatives sector by reintegrating a former ecosystem spin-off. The proposed acquisition values Derive—formerly known as Lyra—at roughly $27 million, with a swap ratio of 1 SNX to 27 DRV tokens. Community Vote to Decide $27M Derive Acquisition Next Week The deal, formalized under Synthetix Improvement Proposal 415 (SIP-415), is pending approval from both the Synthetix and Derive communities, with voting set to take place next week. If greenlit, the merger will combine Derive’s real-world asset (RWA) and front-end trading expertise with Synthetix’s core derivatives infrastructure. The move follows Synthetix’s recent acquisitions of Kwenta and TLX , signaling a strategic push toward vertical reintegration within its ecosystem. “Reuniting under one banner simplifies our architecture and governance and unlocks the next phase,” said Synthetix founder Kain Warwick. He likened the re-acquisition to successful startups “coming back to join the family business.” The proposal positions Synthetix to directly control a suite of derivative products, including perpetuals, options, and app-specific chains—each already linked to SNX, the project’s native token. As part of our full-force drive towards Synthetix v4 on Ethereum mainnet, a new proposal has just dropped: Synthetix to acquire @derivexyz Perps & options Exchange https://t.co/wC7jRyCJqR … Let’s break it down (1/6) — Synthetix (@synthetix_io) May 14, 2025 On social media platform X, Synthetix emphasized the consolidation move as critical to competing with top derivatives players such as Hyperliquid, Binance, dYdX, and Deribit, which was recently acquired by Coinbase. To fund the acquisition, Synthetix will mint up to 29.3 million SNX tokens. These will be distributed with a three-month lockup period, followed by a nine-month linear vesting schedule. At the time of writing, SNX was trading at $0.94, up 11.5% on the day. Still, the token remains significantly down from its February 2021 peak of $28.53—a 97% decline, per CoinGecko. Synthetix Pushes New Staking Plan to Restore sUSD Peg Last month, Synthetix founder Kain Warwick urged SNX stakers to participate in the newly launched sUSD 420 Pool, a staking mechanism introduced to restore the sUSD stablecoin’s dollar peg. The pool offers a share of 5 million SNX tokens to users who lock up their sUSD for 12 months, aiming to reduce the token’s circulating supply and stabilize its value. Despite the incentive, Warwick admitted the process is still “very manual” and lacks a proper user interface, which is currently in development. He warned that if voluntary participation remains low even after the UI launches, more aggressive measures could follow. sUSD, a crypto-collateralized stablecoin backed by SNX, has struggled to maintain its peg, recently falling as low as $0.68 before recovering to $0.77. Warwick emphasized that the solution lies within the SNX community, whose combined wealth could resolve the issue. The initiative is part of SIP-420, which also shifts debt risk from stakers to the protocol itself.

In a May 13 appearance on the Crypto in America podcast, McHenry revealed that during private meetings with Gensler, the former regulator expressed a far more nuanced view of digital assets. “Did he come across, or was he as anti-crypto in private as he did in public?” McHenry was asked. His response: “No… Nope.” McHenry noted that Gensler “saw the value of digital assets” and acknowledged the potential of blockchain technology during his time at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Gerald Gallagher, general counsel at Sei Labs, also noted that Gensler played a role in developing the concept of the airdrop during his academic work, calling it a largely forgotten chapter in his background. However, once Gensler became SEC chair, McHenry said, his stance shifted dramatically. “I had this weird, mistaken, stupid belief that he wouldn’t be that bad as SEC chair,” McHenry admitted. “And I mean, just the level of dismay.” Source: Crypto in America Related: SEC chair suggests ‘huge benefits’ in agency’s third crypto roundtable Gensler’s crypto stance was “confusing” McHenry said discussions with Gensler on crypto regulation were often confusing. McHenry explained that conversations with Gensler about legal frameworks and content structures often started off as reasonable, but quickly became contradictory. He described how Gensler would initially agree with certain points, only to later reject the same facts he had acknowledged moments earlier. According to McHenry, Gensler’s public opposition may have been shaped more by “Senate politics and confirmation politics than anything else.” After departing the SEC on Jan. 20, Gensler returned to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to teach fintech and AI. Under Gensler’s tenure, which started in 2021, the SEC took an aggressive regulatory stance toward crypto, bringing upward of 100 regulatory actions against industry companies. The regulatory hostility has also caused Gensler and his team much scrutiny and backlash from industry leaders. In December 2024, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong announced that the crypto exchange would sever ties with law firms employing former SEC officials involved in what he said was an effort to “unlawfully kill” the crypto industry. Source: Brian Armstrong In January 2025, Gemini also said it won’t be hiring any graduates from MIT unless the university drops former Gensler from his teaching role.

ETH climbed past $2,600 , while Dogecoin shot up to around $0.24, pushing the overall market mood into a positive zone despite some macroeconomic headwinds. Crypto Market Today The total crypto market cap jumped by 1.7%, with Bitcoin holding steady around $103,700. But while the green candles keep flashing, traders are trading carefully. A stronger U.S. dollar and renewed trade tensions have stirred some nerves, raising the risk of short-term profit-taking, especially with Bitcoin hovering near its highs. Analysts are split on where BTC heads next. FxPro’s Alex Kuptsikevich pointed out that the dollar’s strength is putting natural pressure on crypto markets . Meanwhile, QCP Capital highlighted that Bitcoin seems caught between two narratives, one as a safe haven and the other as a risk asset, which is creating indecision in the market. Crypto Fear and Greed Index Despite these uncertainties, the mood among investors remains upbeat. The Fear & Greed Index has held above 70 for four days straight, indicating sustained bullish sentiment. Glassnode analysts are now watching Bitcoin closely near the $105,000 mark to see if it will break higher or stall. Meanwhile, institutional flow hasn’t slowed down. Data from CoinShares shows that crypto investment products attracted $882 million in inflows last week. Bitcoin led with a dominant $867 million, while Ethereum attracted modest flows. Interestingly, Solana saw $3.4 million in outflows, even though traders have been actively buying call options targeting a $200 price by late June . All in all, while global market factors may weigh on short-term action, the altcoin energy and strong capital inflows are keeping the overall crypto mood fairly upbeat.

Standard Chartered will provide a comprehensive suite of banking services to FalconX’s global institutional clients following a strategic partnership, the companies announced on May 14. As part of the collaboration, FalconX will initially integrate Standard Chartered’s banking infrastructure and access to a range of diverse currency pairs for its institutional clients. The partnership ultimately aims to include a broader range of offerings and mutual opportunities, the announcement noted. Crypto support beyond banking The partnership is expected to “expand beyond banking” into additional products and services designed to meet the evolving crypto demand from both FalconX and Standard Chartered’s institutional clients. The joint services will target a broad range of clients, including asset managers, hedge funds, token issuers and payment platforms, the companies said. Matt Long, FalconX’s general manager of APAC and Middle East, referred to Standard Chartered as “one of the most forward-thinking global banks in digital asset adoption.” “At FalconX, we support trading and financing for some of the world’s largest institutions in digital asset markets, and this relationship strengthens our ability to deliver robust banking and FX solutions to clients who rely on us to operate in crypto markets,” he stated. SC is proud to provide banking services to crypto firms Standard Chartered’s collaboration with FalconX underscores the bank’s dedication to improving the digital asset ecosystem, Luke Boland, the bank’s South Asia head of fintech, said. “As institutional demand for digital assets continues to grow, we’re proud to provide the banking infrastructure that enables firms like FalconX to deliver world-class trading and financing solutions to institutional clients,” Boland stated in the announcement. Standard Chartered’s latest crypto move comes as yet another effort by the bank to provide banking services to the crypto industry.

The bank’s involvement in the cryptocurrency industry dates back to 2016, when Standard Chartered made a strategic investment in Ripple, a company behind the XRP ( XRP ) cryptocurrency. The growing banking commitment to crypto comes in line with expectations by executives of major industry firms, including Messari and Sygnum Bank, who forecasted a global banking push into Bitcoin ( BTC ) in the second half of 2025 amid favorable regulatory developments.

In its Q1 2025 earnings report released May 13, Semler Scientific, a publicly traded medical device firm that holds BTC on its balance sheet, reported a 22.2% Bitcoin ( BTC ) yield year-to-date, driven by realized and unrealized gains on its Bitcoin treasury strategy. In terms of dollar gains, Semler saw a $41.6 million BTC gain in Q1, which increased to $52 million by May 12. The company reported purchasing 894 BTC during Q1 at a total cost of $90.7 million, bringing its total Bitcoin holdings to 3,192 BTC as of March 31, with a fair value of $263.5 million. However, this value reflected a cumulative decrease of $16.9 million in fair value. Subsequently, through May 12, Semler acquired an additional 616 BTC for $59.6 million, increasing its total holdings to 3,808 BTC, which now holds a fair value of $387.9 million and a total cost basis of $340 million. Beyond Bitcoin, the company posted $8.8 million in Q1 revenue, down 44% year-over-year. Operating expenses surged to $39.9 million, including a $29.8 million contingent liability tied to a potential DOJ settlement. The result was a net loss of $64.7 million, or $6.74 per share, compared to net income of $6.1 million a year ago.

Strategy , the largest corporate holder with 553,555 BTC, reported a 13.7% BTC yield as of April 28, translating to a $5.8 billion gain year-to-date. That puts it at 58% of its revised full-year BTC dollar gain target of $15 billion. Despite the strong crypto performance, fair value accounting rules drove a GAAP net loss of over $4.2 billion in Q1. Riot Platforms, which held 19,223 BTC as of March 31, reported a year-to-date BTC yield of 7.7%. Despite producing 1,530 BTC in the first quarter, Riot’s profitability was pressured by a sharp increase in average Bitcoin mining cost to $43,808 per BTC, driven by the April 2024 halving and increased global hash rate competition. MARA , the second largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, has not disclosed an explicit Bitcoin yield percentage for the first quarter of this year, but its substantial increase in holdings—from 17,320 BTC in Q1 2024 to 47,531 BTC in Q1 2025, a 174% year-over-year jump—suggests aggressive accumulation and operational scale-up.

The move demonstrates the growing demand from large investors looking to access digital assets through regulated financial infrastructure. According to a May 14 press release , FalconX will integrate Standard Chartered’s banking and foreign exchange services as part of the partnership. This will enable it to give its clients access to a wide range of currency pairs and facilitate faster, more reliable cross-border settlement. The initial rollout will start in Singapore, with plans to spread throughout Asia, the Middle East, and the U.S. Matt Long, general manager for APAC and the Middle East at FalconX, said the partnership is a major step in bridging traditional finance and digital assets. “At FalconX, we support trading and financing for some of the world’s largest institutions in digital asset markets, and this relationship strengthens our ability to deliver robust banking and FX solutions to clients who rely on us to operate in crypto markets.” – Matt Long, general manager for APAC and the Middle East at FalconX You might also like: FalconX and StoneX execute first block trade of CME’s SOL futures FalconX, headquartered in California, serves some of the world’s largest hedge funds, sovereign wealth funds, and asset managers.

FalconX has processed over $1.5 trillion in crypto trades to date and was valued at $8 billion in its most recent funding round, backed by investors such as GIC, Wellington Management, and Tiger Global. Standard Chartered, meanwhile, has been growing its presence in the cryptocurrency sector. The bank has opened spot trading desks for Ethereum ( ETH ) and Bitcoin ( BTC ), partnered with OKX to make it easier to use cryptocurrency collateral, and launched custody services in the UAE. It expects the digital asset market to reach $10 trillion in value by 2026. Both companies see the partnership as a foundation for future growth.

In a statement to crypto.news, a Curve Finance spokesperson said the new domain Curve.finance is “available and safe to use,” while clarifying that user funds remained “secured and safe at all times” throughout the incident. The protocol confirmed that its smart contracts and internal systems were never compromised, and that all services remain fully operational. Curve said it made the switch due to extended downtime and what it described as limited support from the .fi domain registrar, Iwantmyname. “The .fi will be down for too long / no point of moving back,” the team wrote in an X post. It added that registrars handling “.finance domains” offer better responsiveness and reliability compared to those managing .fi domains. The platform reiterated that the breach was strictly limited to the DNS layer and did not involve any unauthorised access to internal infrastructure. “None of our password protections or 2FA systems were bypassed,” the Curve Finance spokesperson said.

However, they confirmed that updates will be shared as soon as more information becomes available. In a separate post-incident update shared on May 13, the team said it took immediate steps to contain the threat, isolate the affected systems, and begin a full investigation. Curve also engaged security partners and its domain registrar to work on restoring normal operations, though the delay in registrar response was a key factor in the decision to abandon the old domain. In a subsequent update, it said that the registrar had successfully frozen the Curve.fi domain, effectively disabling the malicious drainer. Responding to a community member, the project also confirmed plans to introduce a .eth domain, which leverages the Ethereum Name Service, a decentralized alternative to traditional DNS infrastructure. That will come next. Needs slightly more work, but will happen — Curve Finance (@CurveFinance) May 13, 2025 As previously reported by crypto.news, the DNS hijack was first flagged by the Curve team on May 12. The attackers had rerouted traffic from Curve.fi to a spoofed website that mimicked the protocol’s interface and hosted a wallet drainer. The malicious page was live for several hours before access was restricted, prompting warnings from on-chain security firm Blockaid and other industry participants. The price of CRV, the native token of Curve DAO, initially fell nearly 7% to an intraday low of $0.71 following the news, but has since rebounded to $0.76 at press time, marking a 6% gain over the past 24 hours.

Lawmakers in both parties are trying to quickly bring back the GENIUS Act, a stablecoin bill backed by the crypto industry giants, after it stalled last week following backlash over U.S. President Donald Trump ‘s growing crypto ventures. Republican Senator Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, the bill’s lead sponsor, said in an interview with Bloomberg that staff from both parties are still working on it. He said he hopes Democrats will agree to pass the bill before the Memorial Day recess. “The window is now. We will see if reasonableness will prevail,” said Hagerty. The bill had bipartisan support in the Senate Banking Committee. Democratic Senator Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland, a key Democratic supporter of the bill, confirmed that senators have continued to work on it, though no details were disclosed.

As crypto.news reported earlier, the procedural cloture vote failed 48-49, falling short of the 60 votes needed to begin formal debate. Lawmakers cited concerns over insufficient safeguards against illicit finance and foreign stablecoin issuers, while several Democrats pointed to President Donald Trump’s crypto affiliations — including his memecoin and fundraising dinners — as complicating the process.

Morgan Stanley’s head of digital asset markets Andrew Peel has left the bank to launch a new crypto venture, Bloomberg has learned , citing a person familiar with the matter. Peel, a former Credit Suisse trader, joined Morgan Stanley in 2018. He stepped down from his role in March and plans to start fundraising for his new venture in the coming months, per the sources close to the matter. The company will reportedly be based in Zug, Switzerland ‘s crypto hub, and will include an “asset management vehicle that will both invest in and issue DeFi assets such as tokenized funds,” the sources say. The firm will also “operate a technology business to develop trading products that help traditional firms bridge the gap into the space as it becomes more regulated.” You might also like: Morgan Stanley exec says Trump’s threats to Fed chief Powell is ‘noise’ Earlier this year, Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick said the bank wants to work closely with the U.S. Treasury and other regulators to define its role in the crypto market.

Many altcoins have notched impressive gains over the past 24 hours, with RAY and ENA leading the pack from the largest 100. BTC Maintains $103K The primary cryptocurrency enjoyed the beginning of May as its price finally conquered the $100,000 level last Thursday, and it hasn’t looked back since. It kept climbing even during the weekend, but the culmination transpired on Monday when the US and China announced a tariff pause. At the time, BTC skyrocketed to almost $106,000, which became a new multi-month peak. However, the bears finally intervened at this point and didn’t allow an attempt for an all-time high. Just the opposite; BTC started losing value and dropped below $101,000 on Monday evening. It didn’t stay there for long and bounced to around $103,000 yesterday. The aforementioned better-than-expected US CPI numbers for April failed to result in immediate price volatility, but BTC still challenged $105,000 in the evening to no avail. Since then, the asset has lost nearly two grand and fights to stay above $103,000. Its market cap is well above $2.050 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts has taken a beating and is down to 59.1%. BTCUSD.

It has jumped by another 4.5% in the past 24 hours and now sits close to $2,600 after surging to a new multi-month peak of almost $2,750 earlier today. Other notable gainers from the larger-cap alts today include SOL, DOGE, TRX, AVAX, and PI.

Its unique architecture allows developers to build secure and efficient smart contracts. FLOW, its native token, has several key uses within the ecosystem, including paying transaction fees, staking, and participating in network governance.

FLOW is consolidating around $0.463 with weakening momentum. Indicators suggest sideways movement for now. A break above $0.477 may lead to gains, while a drop below $0.456 could trigger a dip to $0.44. Is FLOW a good investment? Flow coin has potential as an investment due to its strong partnerships with major brands and its focus on powering decentralized applications, especially in the NFT and gaming spaces. However, like all cryptocurrencies, it carries significant volatility and risks, so investors should carefully consider market conditions and risk tolerance before investing. Will FLOW reach $1? The $1 price mark is within range, having reached that level in early December 2024. Renewed buyer interest could push FLOW to $1 and above in the coming weeks. Will FLOW reach $5? This level has not been achieved since February 2022. For FLOW to recapture the $5 levels, significant cash inflows will be required. Can FLOW reach $50? FLOW has previously reached an all-time high (ATH) of $46.16, so reaching $50 is achievable. However, a significant bull run and tangible ecosystem updates are required to achieve this feat, as the coin is currently 98% below its ATH. Is Flow a good blockchain? Flow is a solid blockchain, especially for gaming and NFTs. It is designed for scalability, fast transactions, and low fees. The network’s unique multi-role architecture improves efficiency without compromising decentralization. However, it faces fierce competition, and adoption levels are not as high as those of Ethereum and Solana. Does FLOW have a good long-term future? Projections suggest substantial growth over the coming years, with a potential peak of $3-$4 by 2031. This positive outlook reflects a strong potential for sustained value appreciation and continued market relevance. Recent news/opinion on Flow FLOW hits 25M in wrapped FLOW.

Exploring the RWA Sector!,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/05/from-traditional-markets-to-a-bitcoin-powered-digital-economy-exploring-the-rwa-sector,"The world of finance has been witnessing a quiet revolution as tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) have made their way onto the blockchain. In simple terms, tokenization entails turning things like government bonds, real estate, or loans into digital tokens and in 2024, this convergence kicked into high gear — so much so that by early 2025 the total market value of tokenized RWAs on public blockchains had swelled to nearly $18 billion, up from about $10 billion just a year before. Thus, what was once a niche experiment seems to have become a burgeoning movement capable of attracting major banks, asset managers, and fintech innovators. Total on-chain assets as of Q1 2025 (source: Investax.io ) The growth is undeniably real Not long ago, the idea of buying a fraction of a commercial building or a sliver of a government bond using a DeFi platform would have sounded far-fetched. Today, it’s a reality as a wave of projects has brought RWAs on-chain, with the numbers telling a very promising story. For starters, U.S. Treasury securities, which are practically digital mirror images of government bonds, have emerged as one of the fastest-growing segments, with over $6.9 billion worth of these offerings being issued as tokens recently (offering investors a yield of over 4% alongside added perks like 24/7 tradability and near-instant settlements). Tokenized treasury metrics (source: rwa.xyz ) Similarly, private credit consisting of loans and other debt investments traditionally accessible only to institutions now accounts for the largest share of the RWA token market, surpassing $13 billion in value. Crucially, it’s not just crypto startups or DeFi degens driving this trend as major players from the trad-fi have now become deeply involved with the ecosystem. To this point, last year, several household-name institutions rolled out tokenized asset projects, signaling a big shift in mindset. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, for instance, made headlines by launching a tokenized money market fund called BUIDL, which in a matter of weeks grew to hundreds of millions in on-chain assets. By early 2025, BUIDL’s assets under management had ballooned to $2.47 billion , giving it a 42% share of the tokenized Treasury market. Not far behind, Franklin Templeton, a storied mutual fund company, saw over $700 million flow into its own tokenized U.S. government money fund while JPMorgan and other big banks announced their explorations into tokenized treasury funds. Things haven't stopped at bonds as alternative asset giants like Apollo Global Management have started tokenizing private credit funds, and firms such as Hamilton Lane and UBS launched tokenized feeder funds for private equity and money markets. The Bitcoin gold standard and SatLayer’s vision for a new economy Up to now, much of the RWA tokenization trend has played out on smart contract platforms like Ethereum, or on permissioned ledgers set up by banks, with Bitcoin largely being relegated to the background. However, SatLayer is changing that narrative by positioning Bitcoin as the programmable foundation for a new tokenized economy. In essence, SatLayer envisions Bitcoin becoming the “gold standard” of a modern digital economy, where BTC’s solid security foundation and monetary properties underwrite the next generation of DeFi and RWA platforms . That said, what exactly is SatLayer? In simple terms, SatLayer is a shared security platform that uses Bitcoin as the bedrock collateral to secure other applications. One can think of it as a way to plug Bitcoin’s power into the rest of the blockchain universe. However, while Bitcoin’s own blockchain is highly secure, it has been intentionally limited in its functionality, not being designed for running complex smart contracts or supporting millions of tokenized assets directly. SatLayer works around that limitation by operating through smart contracts on companion networks (such as Babylon), interfacing directly with Bitcoin. This allows the flagship crypto to do more than just sit in a cold wallet, enabling it to actively backstop decentralized apps. Moreover, if these services operate honestly, the collateral remains safe and earns rewards for participants; however, if there’s any misbehavior or a breach of rules detected, the system can slash (forfeit) some of that collateral as a penalty. Lastly, it bears mentioning that in late 2024, SatLayer integrated with the Sui blockchain, bringing Bitcoin’s security and liquidity into the latter’s fledgling DeFi economy. By early 2025, over $2 billion worth of Bitcoin was set to be plugged in as shared security for various proof-of-stake blockchains, with SatLayer extending that security to the applications running on those chains. A new era begins? Soon, the lines between traditional markets and crypto markets stand to become increasingly blurred with stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities living atop different blockchain networks. The broader RWA ecosystem will also likely expand thanks to support from both legacy institutions and crypto-native innovations (as instruments like debt tokens and real estate investment trusts (REITs) gain traction).

But spatial computing hasn’t disappeared, and in fact, artificial intelligence is now very much a part of its tech stack alongside AR (augmented reality), VR (virtual reality), and MR (mixed reality). You could even say that it’s spatial computing’s rocket fuel. Broadly speaking, spatial computing is about fusing physical and virtual realms to create an “immersive technology ecosystem for humans to more naturally interact with the world” ( Deloitte ). While some would argue that interacting naturally with the world should mean less technology, not more, the benefits of spatial computing are extensive, which is why the market is projected to hit $280 billion by 2028. So, how exactly is AI helping to potentiate the powers of spatial computing? Read on to find out. AI-Powered R(e)volution To some, spatial computing means VR headsets, AR overlays, and holographic work meetings. To others, it’s about machine proprioception, whereupon physical robots can perceive and interact with our 3D world in real time. Whatever the term means to you, it’s hard to ignore the fact that AI is making spatial computing smarter, faster, and more immersive. Advancements in machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) represent a moonshot for the spatial computing scene, not least because AI can ingest, store, and interpret vast volumes of data generated by wearable devices. 3D model simulations – the digital twins that enable organizations to run what-if scenarios to nail the best course of action – are enriched by the integration of AI and the insights it gleans. Although spatial computing has traditionally been touted to improve staff training and enhance planning (manufacturers optimizing production lines, urban planners simulating hurricanes on a digital simulacrum), AI’s real-time smarts kick things up a notch and give rise to the possibility of bespoke spatial computing experiences. Imagine, for example, having the ability to converse with an LLM-powered avatar or even instruct the latter to perform specific tasks within a digital simulation. Major tech players appreciate the potential of this AI-spatial mashup, and they’re already getting their toes wet. Take Google Cloud’s recent collaboration with British spatial intelligence platform Hadean. By integrating Google’s Gemini AI models into Hadean, the partners are unlocking real-time validation and user-friendly interactions via text and speech in virtual domains. Adrian Poole, Google Cloud’s digital natives UK&I director, hailed the alliance, saying it “empowers organizations to tackle the complex challenges associated with spatial modeling” and has the potential to “transform how governments and organizations approach everything from disaster preparedness to scientific research.” Then there’s Mawari , the world’s first decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) for spatial computing. Created to enable the mass adoption of autonomous AI agents, the DePIN powers real-time streaming of AI-driven immersive material (movies, interactive experiences, etc) via a global network of nodes and is capable of handling high-fidelity, real-time 3D content with ultra-low latency. Mawari’s vision? To replace traditional text or voice interactions with lifelike AI-powered avatars capable of interacting like human beings in XR spaces. Earlier this year, Mawari joined forces with Nankai Electric Railway, Meta Osaka, and e-stadium to launch Digital Entertainment City Namba, hailing it as the world’s first “fully integrated AI + XR + DePIN ecosystem at city scale.” The project is seen as a proving ground for AI-driven 3D avatars (tourist guides, customer service bots) that can transcend language barriers and make a meaningful social impact. Given the hype around smart cities, expect more AI-powered digital landscapes to emerge over the coming years, with governments stress-testing sustainability policies in XR before any official roll-out. The Future of AI x Spatial Computing The intersection of multimodal AI and spatial computing is unlocking a veritable tsunami of innovation, transforming manufacturing, healthcare, gaming, tourism, city planning, and countless other fields. With artificial intelligence acting as the spinal column of mixed reality, there is no limit (beyond our imagination) to the advances that can be achieved.

In a new video update, crypto strategist Jason Pizzino tells his 351,000 YouTube subscribers that the price of Bitcoin and other crypto assets could be negatively impacted if the USDT dominance (USDT.D) chart does not soon dip below the 3.7% support level. A bullish USDT dominance, the ratio of USDT’s market cap relative to the rest of the crypto assets, is generally considered bearish for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as it indicates traders are unloading their crypto holdings in favor of the stablecoin. “So over the coming months, leading into this early quarter three, perhaps, USDT dominance, if it’s still not breaking through the zone of 3.7% to 4.5%, probably a good sign to get a little cautious on your trades and not to get a bit too crazy… The reason for that is, this is where the money is in crypto. This is like our global money supply for Bitcoin, and if it’s not getting projected out there, if it’s not being released, well, then where is the money coming from? Some might say, well, it’s just ETF (exchange-traded funds) buying. And that goes straight from cold, hard USD into ETFs, into Bitcoin ETFs, perhaps. This has had such a strong correlation between the two that it would seem unwise to forget about it. And yes, I already hear the argument saying, well, just because it’s correlated doesn’t mean it has to continue on like that. For sure, but while it’s still working, probably a good idea to keep it there.” Source: Jason Pizzino/YouTube At time of writing, USDT.D is hovering at 4.53%. He also looks at the combined dominance of the Tether-issued stablecoin USDT plus the dominance of USDC , issued by Circle, and says the chart needs to dip below 5% to trigger explosive rallies for BTC, Ethereum ( ETH ) and other digital assets. “Now the other one I take a look at is USDT dominance plus USDC dominance, so the two largest stablecoins… You’re back down here at the double bottom of 5%. So this chart also should be able to break down from the 5% level if we’re going to see some pretty significant gains for Bitcoin, ETH and so on.” Source: Jason Pizzino/YouTube Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The stock market and crypto both moved up, with the Nasdaq 100 climbing 1.6%, and the S&P 500 Index rising 0.72%. Bitcoin stayed well above $100,000, showing strength for the second day in a row. That same day, investor mood changed as China and the United States agreed to temporarily cut tariffs. That was the first time since February 28 that the S&P 500 ended in the green. The crypto market cap crossed $3.5 trillion, its highest since February 2. Wall Street’s energy was obvious. Nvidia spiked 5.6% after announcing a deal to send 18,000 AI chips to Saudi Arabia. That helped boost other chipmakers. Broadcom jumped almost 5%, and AMD added around 4%. Tech stocks run while Dow sinks While tech shares kept pushing upward, not every corner of the market followed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 269.67 points, or 0.64%, because UnitedHealth collapsed by 18%. Despite the Dow’s fall, Apple logged its fourth day of gains, Amazon its fifth, Goldman Sachs also moved higher for five straight sessions, and Disney extended its own streak to six days. Futures showed a quieter mood early Wednesday. S&P 500 futures were up 0.06%, Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.1%, and Dow futures were flat. But the optimism from Tuesday’s bounce was still visible. Tech led the rally again, especially after Nvidia’s chip shipment news. The company’s plan to deliver thousands of AI chips overseas sent a strong signal, especially as chip stocks have taken center stage during 2025’s ups and downs. On the crypto side, the gains matched Wall Street’s mood. Traders responded to two things: easing trade tension and new economic data. The Federal Reserve, which met earlier this month, had warned about possible stagflation because of high tariffs rolled out by Trump in April. But that concern cooled after the U.S. paused most reciprocal tariffs for 90 days, made a deal with the UK, and struck a temporary agreement with China to lower most levies. Investors eye inflation and upcoming data The Consumer Price Index for April increased 2.3% year over year. That was under the 2.4% forecast from economists. Core inflation, which excludes energy and food, landed right on target at 2.8%. Those numbers calmed markets that had been bracing for something hotter. Treasury yields dropped right after. The 10-year yield fell more than 3 basis points to 4.468%, and the 2-year yield dropped more than 1 basis point to 4%. Deutsche Bank said the April inflation data didn’t fully reflect Trump’s Liberation Day tariffs, and analysts don’t expect those effects to show up until June. “Our US economists think the April data is still too early for the Liberation Day tariffs to show up in the aggregate numbers,” their note said. Meanwhile, eToro, the trading platform that handles both stocks and crypto, priced its IPO at $52 per share. It’s planning to list on the Nasdaq under the ticker ETOR. The company had pulled its original IPO in March due to tariff worries but is now going ahead. It had originally aimed for a range of $46 to $50. Investors now wait for Thursday, when the government will release the Producer Price Index and retail sales data. These reports could give another window into how the U.S. economy is absorbing all the moving pieces—tariffs, inflation, and shifting global trade deals.

US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Record $96 Million Net Outflow According to SoSoValue data, most of the outflows on Tuesday came from Fidelity’s FBTC, which recorded net outflows of $91.39 million. Hashdex’s DEFI came in second with outflows of $4.75 million. All other spot Bitcoin ETFs reported zero net inflows for the day. The decline comes after a record net inflow of $41.18 billion across 12 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs reported on Monday. Despite the ETF outflows, the overall crypto market has continued to rally. At the time of publication, Bitcoin (BTC) is up 1.4% in the past 24 hours to $103,775, while Ethereum (ETH) is up 8.9% to $2,667. The ongoing rally is supported by progress in US-China trade talks and improved investor sentiment following a positive US inflation report. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for April increased by 0.2% monthly, easing the annual rate to 2.3%, the lowest level since February 2021. Presto Research analysts warned that while the current momentum is positive, the duration of the crypto rally may depend on the course of macroeconomic conditions, particularly tariff developments between the US and China. “Last night’s release of the lower-than-expected April CPI data provided some relief to markets. However, the broader implications of the US-China trade talks could be more decisive in determining the medium-term direction of cryptocurrencies,” Peter Chung and Ming Jung wrote in a client note. With macro conditions easing and inflation slowing, investors will be watching closely to see if ETF flows continue their upward trend or signal increased caution in overheated markets. *This is not investment advice.

But what if behind closed doors, he wasn’t the villain he seemed? You’ll want to take a seat for this. For years, the former SEC Chair was the face of regulatory crackdowns in crypto. But a recent revelation just flipped that narrative on its head. Turns out, what we saw in public might not tell the full story. There’s a side of Gensler the crypto world never got to see. Let’s break it down. Mixed Messages Behind the Scenes In a surprising twist, U.S. Representative Patrick McHenry dropped a revelation on the Crypto in America podcast this week: Gensler, the former SEC Chair known for his harsh stance on digital assets, may have secretly supported crypto all along. “Did he come across, or was he as anti-crypto in private as he did in public?” McHenry was asked. His response: “No… Nope.” According to McHenry, conversations with Gensler during his time in office were anything but straightforward. One moment he acknowledged the value of blockchain innovation, the next he was backpedaling or outright contradicting himself. “Confusing” was the word McHenry used – and it’s not hard to see why. Gensler’s academic past tells a different story. At MIT, he spoke positively about digital assets and even contributed to early airdrop concepts. But once he stepped into the SEC chair role in 2021, everything changed. Enforcement Over Clarity Under Gensler’s leadership, the SEC went on the offensive. From Coinbase and Binance to smaller crypto projects, the commission filed over 100 actions – many without offering a clear legal framework. A 2025 academic paper titled “ Uncertain Regulations, Definite Impacts… ” broke it down: surprise enforcement moves led to major price drops – averaging a 5.2% dip in three days, deepening to 17.2% over 30 days. Investor confidence was often shattered. Rather than clarifying how digital assets fit into existing laws, the SEC relied on the decades-old Howey Test, a framework not really built for decentralized tokens. The result was a regulatory gray zone where crypto projects are either caught off guard or forced to flee the United States. The Industry Fought Back And flee they did. After repeated clashes with the SEC, several major crypto companies began shifting operations abroad. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong cut ties with law firms connected to former SEC officials and accusing the agency of trying to “unlawfully kill” the industry. Gemini went a step further, announcing it would avoid hiring MIT grads unless the university removed Gensler from its faculty. The backlash was real. Two Faces, Two Legacies? So which Gary Gensler is real? The blockchain believer from MIT, or the enforcer who hurt the crypto industry deeply? Maybe it’s both. As the U.S. crypto markets rebuild under a crypto-positive Trump administration, his legacy – love it or hate it – will shape the debate for years to come.",News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB|AIRDROP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-14 09:24:36

Bitcoin (BTC) climbed back above $103,000 and is continuing to accumulate above $100,000, perhaps with a view to an assault on the all-time high of $109,000 in the next several days. Lower inflation rise, but tariffs impact still to be felt Some may have expected to see inflation start to rear its ugly head again on the back of the tariff wars. However, April’s CPI figure has come in lower than expected, and economists are saying that it may be a few months before the full effect of the tariffs are felt. Even with this lower than expected rise in inflation, the Federal Reserve may still not make the cuts that the Trump Administration needs. Being able to say that the impact of the tariffs is too uncertain on future inflation could provide the cover needed to just sit back and do nothing. NBC News reported Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler as saying “ultimately, I see the U.S. as likely to experience lower growth and higher inflation.” $BTC crabs sideways between major levels Source: TradingView The short-term time frame for $BTC shows that the price is caught between the two major horizontal levels of $202,000 and $204,000. A couple of quick dips below $101,000 were bought up very quickly, as witnessed by the two candle wicks down to the support of the 0.382 Fibonacci level. Given the importance of these two levels, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the $BTC price crabbing sideways between them for a while. The longer this goes on, a breakout in one direction or the other could be explosive, especially if it is to the upside. Last resistance level at $104,000 is all that is detaining $BTC price Source: TradingView As always, zooming out into the higher time frame puts everything into perspective. One only has to look back at the previous bull flag and how once the price held above the upper trendline, a strong surge to the upside was what followed. Once that surge started losing momentum, the next bull flag began to be formed. It would seem that all that is detaining the price right now is that last level of resistance at $104,000. If the bulls can force the price above this level and hold it, the surge out of the top of the bull flag can resume. Below the chart, the RSI is showing the indicator is above the yellow moving average. This needs to continue. Right at the bottom of the chart, the MACD is displaying the next green bar and the indicator lines have crossed up. All is set, and lift-off may not be too far away.

44604249,https://square.htx.com/?p=44316,1747214861,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/100/default.png,"HTX April Report: Global Net Inflow Leader, Brand Strength Soars",https://square.htx.com/htx-april-report-global-net-inflow-leader-brand-strength-soars/,"May 14, 2025, Singapore – Despite escalating global trade tensions and market uncertainty, HTX, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, today announced strong April 2025 results, demonstrating robust growth and innovation. The report highlights the platform’s excellent performance, expanded trading, branding events, new listings, product innovation, security and user engagement, further solidifying HTX’s position as a leading centralized exchange. HTX Tops Among Global CEXs in Net Inflows, Trading Volume Up 9.65% According to data from DeFiLlama, HTX achieved the highest net capital inflow among major centralized exchanges in April, registering $472 million.This inflow volume outpaced some competitors by 6 to 7 times, reflecting growing market confidence and user trust in HTX’s ongoing improvements in asset security, liquidity, and product experience. Monthly trading volume rose 9.65% from March, underscoring continued platform activity. CoinGecko data ranked HTX as the 10th largest global CEX by market share at 5.4%, making it the only top-tier exchange to record positive month-over-month growth during a generally subdued market period.The exchange’s consistent performance reflects its strength in market liquidity, user retention, and trading engagement. Strategic Asset Listings and International Events Drive Heightened User Activity HTX maintained a fast-paced listing cadence in April, introducing 14 new tokens spanning prominent sectors such as staking infrastructure and emerging on-chain primitives. Many listings delivered significant returns. STO surged as high as 303% post-launch on HTX and continues to perform strongly in Binance’s spot market. DARK (an MCP project) and HOUSE (a meme coin on Solana) saw gains of 246% and 176%, respectively. HTX was also the first platform to list USD1, a stablecoin by World Liberty Financial, and KERNEL, a key staking infrastructure project. These strategic listings reinforce HTX’s reputation as a primary platform for early access to high-potential digital assets. Expanding its global presence, HTX DAO accelerated its brand outreach with a series of offline events, including “Hong Kong Night”, “Moscow Blockchain Forum”, and “Dubai Night” in key crypto hubs worldwide. The most high-profile event was the “HTX DAO x TRON 2025 Hong Kong Whale Night” on April 8, featuring a keynote address by TRON founder and Advisor to HTX, Justin Sun. In his address, Sun emphasized themes of heritage, commitment, and construction, reaffirming HTX’s mission to build a free, open, and transparent crypto financial system amidst geopolitical and economic volatility — positioning HTX and TRON as trusted pillars in the global ecosystem. HTX also launched a large-scale user campaign, the Million USDT Airdrop Celebration, offering cross-product rewards across spot, futures, loan, and earning services. The campaign attracted millions of off-platform impressions and boosted user activity across regions. Notably, HTX also kicked off a special edition of its Mars Program, offering one lucky user — selected from a global pool — the extraordinary opportunity to embark on a $6 million space journey with Justin Sun in July, marking a groundbreaking initiative in user engagement. Product Enhancements and Research Insights Fuel Platform Advancement HTX delivered several product upgrades in April aimed at improving trading experience and user empowerment. HTX Convert rolled out a 1:1 swap for USDT and USDD, improving asset flexibility. HTX DAO upgraded governance by introducing on-chain voting for HIPs, a move that enhances transparency and user participation. Additionally, the exchange enhanced the NewListing section (v2.0) to refine the user experience of trading new assets. It also improved its website’s homepage promotion to boost brand campaign exposure. HTX also launched APY Booster Coupons for SmartEarn, expanding incentives for users. These upgrades enhanced the user experience while also strengthening HTX’s competitiveness and innovation at the product level. In parallel, HTX Research and HTX Ventures jointly released two in-depth reports that deeply analyze the development of the cryptocurrency market in the new cycle, focusing on technological innovation, macroeconomic dynamics, and policy trends. “Sonic: A Model for the New DeFi Paradigm” explored Sonic Network’s technical architecture and cross-chain design. “Crypto Challenges and Opportunities Amid Macro Noise” analyzed how U.S. dollar policy and macro trends are influencing crypto cycles and investment strategies. In an interview with Tech in Asia, HTX Ventures Head Alec offered perspective on what lies ahead for the industry: “The landscape has really changed drastically.” Alec expects Web3 to further mature in 2025, achieving wider mainstream recognition and adoption. Unwavering Commitment to Security and Service Evidenced by 30% Increase in USDT Reserve HTX continued to operate with a high standard of transparency and safety. May marked the 31st consecutive month of public reserves disclosures. According to the latest Merkle Tree-based reports , USDT reserves rose by more than 30% month-over-month, signaling renewed user trust and capital inflows. HTX’s security team proactively protected users in April, preventing substantial potential losses. This included intercepting 2 fraudulent withdrawals (7,587 USDT), freezing stolen assets (164,700 USDT) from 11 off-platform incidents, and blocking 8 deposits from blacklisted addresses (49,172 USDT). HTX also added 1,750 addresses to its blacklist, and took down 33 phishing websites and apps. Over 220,000 security alerts were also sent to users, significantly enhancing platform security. Throughout April, HTX’s customer support team efficiently managed 63,449 service requests from 32,447 users through the online support and ticketing systems, with most inquiries related to P2P trades and on-chain transactions. The team maintained a user satisfaction rate above 83%. HTX’s strong April performance underscores its long-term strategic vision and its ability to navigate uncertainty with confidence. As HTX DAO’s on-chain governance mechanisms gain traction, user participation is expected to deepen, fueling the next phase of community-driven growth. Looking ahead, HTX remains committed to its “user-first” philosophy, continuing to expand globally with a focus on delivering superior asset offerings, a dynamic product suite, and an energetic ecosystem tailored for the next wave of the crypto economy.

The digital payment token service provider, which received a Major Payment Institution (MPI) from the Singapore regulator, said that StableX enables “always-on access” to foreign exchange with speed, cost-efficiency, and reliability. MetaComp, a licensed institution in Singapore, has released the cross-border foreign exchange payment infrastructure platform, StableX. The platform is specifically designed to meet the foreign exchange needs of cross-border merchants, financial institutions, payment service… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 14, 2025 The platform is developed for cross-border merchants, institutions, fintechs and global businesses, an official release shared by Colin Wu, read. StableX to Support USDT, USDC The StableX platform currently supports Tether ( USDT ) and USD Coin ( USDC ), the two top stablecoins per market cap. It is looking to add other prominent stablecoins, including FDUSD, PYUSD, and WUSD, as a part of its asset offering. Further, StableX uses an “intelligent routing engine,” which automatically selects between USD or stablecoins to carry out each transaction. “[It chooses] depending on which rail offers the best outcome in terms of cost, speed, and settlement certainty,” MetaComp said. “StableX was purpose-built for cross-border B2B payments,” said Tin Pei Ling, Co-President of MetaComp. “With StableX, we’re making it faster, more intelligent, and more stable to move money globally — and we’re doing it with the power of stablecoins.” MetaComp’s CAMP Helps in Seamless ‘High-Volume’ FX Transactions In an exclusive interview with Cryptonews last year, Eddie Hui, Chief Operating Officer and Co-President of MetaComp, said that the company is building a Client Asset Management Platform (CAMP) that fully manages users’ fiat and cryptos. StableX will leverage CAMP to enable high-volume FX transactions across borders, the release noted. “We’re trying to promote the adoption of crypto as a real and legitimate asset class that could allow you to do anything else in the rest of the traditional finance,” Eddie told Cryptonews at the time, adding that the CAMP platform would centralise all those services. Additionally, CAMP will offer the opportunity for clients to obtain yield on treasury balances and available liquidity, MetaComp noted. StableX will initially support a set of currency pairs and aims to roll out access to 31 major currencies that MetaComp already supports. “This phased rollout ensures liquidity, operational reliability, and regulatory compliance as users grow their global payment operations,” it added.

Analysts now project SOL could reclaim the $200–$250 range in the upcoming bull run, particularly if institutional interest and NFT momentum continue to grow. Meanwhile, attention is shifting to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is being positioned as high-upside contenders that could mirror Solana’s earlier growth trajectory. With a scheduled launch cemented at listing price $0.06, Phase 4 investors of the Mutuum Finance presale are poised to reap 140% returns when the token hits the open market. The presale so far has raised in excess of $8.1 million and boasts over 9800 holders with phase 4 over 70% sold out. Solana’s Next Move: Can SOL Recapture Its Explosive Momentum in 2025? Solana (SOL) is in the spotlight once again after a wave of analysts project a solid rebound up to the $200 level and new impetus from growing developer interest and more exposure to the institutional sphere. SOL is poised to profit from an expansive market resurgence with its rapid blockchain operations and increasing utility in DeFi and meme coins. However, this cycle is unlike that of 2021, when there was a meteoric explosion, and the only praxis may be more than just speed and scalability to beat peers, given that Ethereum Layer-2s and other smart contract flourishes are narrowing the gap. Despite remaining a major contender, new low-cap tokens such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are starting to fall under speculative capital of traders in search of exponential profits. Over $8.1M Raised from 9,800+ Early Adopters Mutuum Finance presale is not easing off. Now in Phase 4, the $0.025 token is on the verge of a price hike. When the presale enters Phase 5, the value will rise to $0.03, treating current investors to an instant 20% gain. With a projected launch price of $0.06, the profit potential grows by the day. Crypto analysts have already designated MUTM as one of the most undervalued DeFi tokens of the year. With more than $8.1 million funded and 9,800+ users, Mutuum Finance is set to fly. Driving Engagement Through Leaderboards and Incentives Mutuum Finance has introduced a real-time leaderboard for the holders of MUTM to display the top 50 holders which is more community driven. These holders are to be rewarded with bonus tokens that bring innovative competitive aspects to their platform. This way, Mutuum Finance is encouraging the token holding while also raising the level of interaction among big supporters in the community. Mutuum Finance is building a fully collateralized, USD-backed stablecoin to be issued on the Ethereum network. Its overcollateralized design ensures long-term price stability, eschewing the collapse risks which have plagued algorithmic stablecoins. On the security front, the platform is run by open-source, third-party audited smart contracts, laying a good foundation for user trust and institutional adoption. Gamified Ecosystem and Community Incentives Mutuum Finance is also gamifying the user interface with a leaderboard of the top 50 holders of tokens, who are to be rewarded with additional MUTM tokens. On top of that, there is a $100,000 giveaway going on, with ten winners selected to each receive $10,000 in tokens. There is also a referral program running, which rewards users for helping to grow the platform through organic, grassroots outreach. Solana made millionaires, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could be next. Over $8.1M raised, 9,800+ holders, and Phase 4 is 70% sold. Buy at $0.025 now for 140% gains at launch. Leaderboard rewards and a $100K giveaway add fuel. Blink, and you’ll miss it.

Analysts point to MUTM,https://invezz.com/news/2025/05/14/best-crypto-to-buy-now-that-could-outpace-xrp-analysts-point-to-mutm/,"When it comes to finding the best crypto to buy now, most investors look to strong fundamentals, clear roadmaps, and room for price discovery. XRP has long been considered a top-tier option with its utility in cross-border payments — but according to several market watchers, a lesser-known token called Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now entering the spotlight. MUTM is still in presale, offering a low entry point, while XRP continues to trade within a tight range. With its protocol still in development and real yield mechanisms already mapped out, Mutuum is gathering momentum at a pace that has analysts rethinking which cryptocurrency to invest in for the next cycle. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Unlike tokens relying solely on speculation, MUTM is tied to a working protocol — a decentralized finance system that allows users to lend and borrow digital assets through secure smart contracts. The platform is being built as non-custodial, meaning users stay in control of their funds, and it supports both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models. In the P2C setup, users deposit their crypto into liquidity pools, and borrowers tap into those pools by posting overcollateralized assets. Interest rates shift depending on how much liquidity is being used, creating an organic balance between lenders and borrowers. In contrast, the P2P model allows users to set their own terms, bypassing pooled risk and enabling direct agreements. This dual-model design not only provides flexibility but also helps the platform scale across different user needs and asset types — an approach that goes far beyond what XRP offers in its current scope. As of now, over $8.2 million has been raised during the presale, with more than 9,800 holders already participating. The fourth phase is more than 80% sold, and once it completes, the token price will jump from $0.025 to $0.03. With a $0.06 launch price already set, investors who get in now are guaranteed a 140% gain by listing alone — not including any post-launch growth. With 11 total presale stages, each round presents diminishing opportunity for early access pricing. This progressive pricing model is helping drive urgency and making MUTM a target for those seeking the next crypto to explode based on utility, not hype. What makes MUTM stand out even more is how it recycles protocol revenue. Part of the revenue earned through lending and borrowing activity is allocated to purchasing MUTM tokens from the open market. These tokens are later distributed to mtToken holders — tokens that represent a user’s deposit and accrue value over time. This mechanism creates a direct connection between platform activity and token value. As user participation increases, so does revenue — and that flow is returned to contributors. It’s a practical framework designed to support long-term growth while rewarding continued engagement, offering an edge over fixed-utility tokens. Mutuum is also developing a fully overcollateralized stablecoin, which will maintain a 1:1 peg with the US dollar through smart contract logic. This stablecoin will be minted when users deposit excess collateral, and its supply will shrink automatically as loans are repaid or closed. It’s a transparent, self-balancing system designed to offer stability without the need for centralized backing. The platform is being launched on an Ethereum Layer 2, providing faster and cheaper transactions — a necessary feature for scaling without burdening users with high gas fees. This technical choice further enhances user experience and accessibility, especially as DeFi adoption expands. Security remains a priority, with CertiK currently auditing Mutuum’s smart contracts to ensure platform integrity. A beta version of the platform is expected to go live at the time of launch, giving users immediate access to lending features and real-time protocol usage — not just speculative trading. This timeline puts MUTM ahead of many new crypto projects that launch with little more than a whitepaper. For investors interested in platforms with actual delivery plans, this is another reason why MUTM is increasingly being seen as one of the best cryptos to invest in today. While XRP continues to hold its ground in the top cryptocurrency rankings, its growth potential remains limited by regulatory battles and an already mature market position. MUTM, on the other hand, is still in its early stages — with a low entry price, protocol-backed value distribution, and ongoing product development. The current presale structure rewards early access, and the team’s clear path toward platform launch, stablecoin integration, and Layer 2 support adds further upside. For those asking which crypto to buy today for long-term growth, MUTM is shaping up as a strong contender — and possibly one that outperforms legacy tokens in the months ahead.

Despite hitting a new record high in 2025, Bitcoin ( BTC ) faces a sustained wave of skepticism, reflected in a growing number of ‘death’ declarations. In the first half of 2025 alone, Bitcoin has faced 11 obituary declarations, surpassing the 10 recorded throughout all of 2024, according to data retrieved by Finbold from Bitcoin Obituaries on May 14. A Bitcoin obituary is a public claim, often by critics or institutions, that Bitcoin is worthless or doomed, usually made during periods of high volatility or price surges. Historically, Bitcoin has been pronounced ‘dead’ during nearly every market cycle. This pessimism peaked in 2017, when BTC hit almost $20,000 and faced a record 93 obituaries, accounting for 21.6% of all recorded declarations. In contrast, 2010 saw just one, when the asset was still largely unknown. In total, Bitcoin has been declared dead 430 times since its inception. Bitcoin obituaries since 2010. Source: Bitcoin Obituaries Bitcoin top skeptics for 2025 Some of the most notable 2025 obituaries came as Bitcoin hit $104,735 on January 30. Nobel laureate Eugene Fama warned that cryptocurrencies lack stable value and predicted Bitcoin’s collapse. A few days earlier, on January 26, longtime critic Peter Schiff slammed Bitcoin’s energy-intensive proof-of-work system, arguing it lacks real backing. On February 28, Solana ( SOL ) co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko claimed Bitcoin has ‘no value’ and could be replaced by a global superpower, citing environmental concerns. Then on April 4, with Bitcoin trading at $83,843, Canadian billionaire Frank Giustra said the ‘digital gold’ narrative was fading. By April 10, as Bitcoin hovered at $80,714, Schiff doubled down, predicting a 2025 financial crisis would ‘kill’ the cryptocurrency. To date, Schiff remains Bitcoin’s most frequent critic, responsible for 18 obituaries. Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A , BRK.B ) founder Warren Buffett ranks second with eight, followed by economist Steve Hanke. Bitcoin price analysis Despite the declarations, Bitcoin continues its push for a fresh all-time high above $100,000. As of press time, the asset was trading at $103,620, up nearly 1% in the last 24 hours and almost 7% over the past week. Bitcoin seven-day price chart.

Fidelity’s FBTC led the downturn with $91.39 million in net redemptions, while Hashdex’s DEFI ETF saw $4.75 million in outflows, according to data from SoSoValue . These two funds were the only ones among the 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs to report any movement, as all others posted flat flows. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Hit Record $41.18B Inflows Before Sharp Reversal The reversal followed a milestone on Monday, when the group of spot Bitcoin ETFs reached an all-time high of $41.18 billion in cumulative net inflows. Despite the ETF retreat, Bitcoin itself remained strong, rising 1.4% in the past 24 hours to trade at $103,775. Ethereum also rallied, jumping 8.9% to $2,667. The broader crypto market remained in positive territory, buoyed by easing inflation data and hopes for progress in U.S.-China trade negotiations. April’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) came in lower than expected, up just 0.2% for the month, bringing annual inflation to 2.3%—its lowest level since February 2021. Presto Research analysts suggested the sustainability of the current crypto rally may hinge on further developments in trade relations and the long-term effects of tariffs. “The weaker-than-expected April CPI release last night provided some relief for markets,” wrote analysts Peter Chung and Ming Jung in a recent note. Daily Market Brief 250514 pic.twitter.com/fPAQNZ9HTR — Presto Research (@Presto_Research) May 14, 2025 Easing Trade Tensions and Market Optimism Could Fuel Bitcoin’s Next Move Despite recent volatility, the broader macro environment is becoming increasingly favorable for Bitcoin, according to Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at YouHodler. In a note shared with Cryptonews.com, Lienkha said with global equities showing strength, particularly the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, which has surged nearly 20% since April, investors are shifting capital into riskier assets, including crypto. Bitcoin remains supported by key long-term drivers such as institutional adoption, post-halving supply constraints, and improving regulatory clarity. While altcoin activity has picked up, Lienkha sees it more as sentiment-driven than a true capital rotation, especially with most altcoins still far below their all-time highs. On the macro front, easing global trade tensions—such as lower tariffs—could reduce inflationary pressure and improve liquidity, which generally benefits risk assets like Bitcoin. Although the recent tariff rollback is limited, Lienkha believes it could still enhance investor confidence and contribute to crypto market resilience. A stable or rising equity market, he added, provides the right backdrop for Bitcoin to retest all-time highs. “Conversely, if equity markets come under pressure, that negative sentiment is typically mirrored in Bitcoin’s price performance,” he concluded.

But like many meme-based tokens before it, sustained utility has proven elusive. Without built-in user incentives or practical mechanisms for ongoing participation, Pepe holders have found themselves waiting on price swings rather than engaging directly with the network. Bitcoin Solaris offers a fundamentally different model — one centered on daily earning through accessible, low-barrier mobile mining. Rather than buying dips or waiting on market sentiment, users can generate BTC-S tokens by simply running an app on their smartphone. How Smartphone Mining Works Without Hardware Costs The cornerstone of the Bitcoin Solaris ecosystem is the Nova App, a soon-to-launch mobile platform that turns phones into passive income devices. Users allocate a few gigabytes of storage and idle CPU power, and in return, they receive daily BTC-S token rewards based on uptime and contribution. Unlike traditional proof-of-work networks, there’s no need to purchase ASICs or configure GPUs. Nova runs silently in the background and consumes minimal resources. It’s not cloud mining or custodial delegation — it’s direct, on-chain participation through lightweight mobile infrastructure. This makes Bitcoin Solaris the first blockchain to enable real mobile mining profits with no upfront investment, no staking requirements, and no dependence on market timing. Dual-Layer Infrastructure Built for Utility and Scale Bitcoin Solaris is more than just a mobile mining app — it’s a high-speed, smart contract-capable blockchain with a scalable architecture designed for long-term sustainability. Its dual-layer system separates security from execution: The Base Layer uses Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-Capacity (PoC) to secure the ledger in a low-energy, decentralized format. The Solaris Layer powers smart contracts, token interactions, and Nova App mining via Proof-of-History (PoH)and Proof-of-Time (PoT) — processing over 10,000 transactions per second with 2-second finality. This performance rivals and exceeds many leading chains, all while supporting real-time reward distribution to users who mine via mobile. In a recent video, Crypto Nitro explains how Bitcoin Solaris’s mobile mining model addresses the limitations of meme tokens like Pepe Coin. The analysis dives into yield potential, energy efficiency, and how smartphone-based rewards give users real control over their crypto earnings. Presale Phase 3: Access Before Network-Driven Demand Bitcoin Solaris is now in Presale Phase 3, offering BTC-S tokens at $3 USDT. This stage allows new users and early backers to acquire tokens ahead of public exchange listings and before the Nova App’s mining rewards system goes live. Only 4.2 million BTC-S (20%) of the total 21 million fixed supply is allocated to presale. No inflation, no hidden minting — distribution will occur primarily through mobile mining and user participation, not through central issuances. For those priced out of other ecosystems or burned by hype-driven cycles, Bitcoin Solaris provides structured, direct access with clear utility from day one. Audited and Verified for Security and Transparency With increasing scrutiny on new crypto projects, Bitcoin Solaris has taken proactive steps to ensure credibility and infrastructure integrity: Cyberscope Audit : Evaluated smart contract security, permissions, and reward logic Freshcoins Audit : Confirmed emission mechanisms and blockchain behavior KYC Verification : Publicly verified the project team and operations These audits ensure Bitcoin Solaris can scale securely, reward users predictably, and operate with full transparency across its infrastructure layers. Pepe Coin rode a wave of attention, but without earning mechanics or sustainable architecture, momentum fades. Bitcoin Solaris offers a solution — mobile mining through smartphones with daily BTC-S rewards, audited infrastructure, and a capped supply. As Nova App mining approaches, Bitcoin Solaris is already redefining what user-first blockchain participation looks like.

Cloud mining is BitFuFu's primary revenue source, accounting for over half of its annual revenue in the past three years. The company ticks all boxes as a Bitcoin miner with strong potential to grow and is also using a Bitcoin treasury strategy. A two-year forecast for EH/s, revenue, and operating expenses reveals the company is well-positioned to see strong growth in operating income in the next two years. Singapore is a tech hub. If you have ever visited this tiny nation with a population of around 6 million, you'd know that. Although not a bet on the tech sector, I have invested in one of Singapore's largest banks - DBS Group Holdings ( OTCPK:DBSDF ), so I am not new to exploring investment opportunities in the nation. When it comes to tech investing, I have so far preferred American and Chinese companies, given that there have been an abundance of opportunities in these markets over the past 8 years. However, BitFuFu Inc. ( FUFU ), a Singapore-based Bitcoin miner, caught my attention recently. After understanding the company, its ongoing business transformation, and the global market it is tapping into, I find FUFU interesting. A Flexible, Scalable Business BitFuFu, at its core, is a company that offers cloud mining solutions. For those who are unfamiliar with this concept, cloud mining enables individuals (or even companies, for that matter) to conduct Bitcoin mining by leasing equipment or computing power from a data center operator. As many of you know, Bitcoin mining requires the acquisition of mining hardware, which incurs substantial up-front costs, storage costs, and electricity. Cloud mining provides a perfect solution for this, as miners do not need to manage mining hardware when they sign up to lease mining equipment from a cloud mining solutions provider such as BitFuFu. BitFuFu generates revenue in a few different ways, with the sale of cloud mining being the leading source. In each of the last three years, cloud mining has accounted for more than half of its annual revenue. BitFuFu offers a unique, one-stop cloud mining experience to its users by charging them an upfront fee to onboard them. To provide this packaged solution, BitFuFu purchases mining equipment and pays for hosting services. In 2024, cloud mining accounted for almost 60% of revenue. As of April, BitFuFu had over 612,000 registered cloud-mining users. Exhibit 1: BitFuFu segment information Investor presentation BitFuFu also generates revenue from self-mining Bitcoin. This involves the company using the Full Pay-Per-Share method (a commonly used revenue distribution model) to confirm Bitcoin payout daily based on hash calculations. Self-mining, after growing from $100 million in 2023 to $157.5 million in 2024, accounted for 34% of the company revenue in 2024. BitFuFu's other business lines include selling mining equipment and providing miner hosting services. After understanding BitFuFu's business model, what stands out is the flexibility with which it can efficiently deploy Bitcoin miners across cloud mining and self-mining operations to maximize rewards. This flexibility, in my opinion, helps the company allocate resources strategically during increased market volatility to maintain stable revenue growth compared to some other Bitcoin miners. BitFuFu's Aladdin system is at the center of this strategy, as it enables adjustments to the allocation of hash rate between self-mining and cloud mining operations. This advanced system is home to several unique features, such as FuFu Sentry for miner monitoring, FuFu Proxy for mining capacity slicing, and FuFu Dispatcher Engine for hash calculation dispatching. BitFuFu is backed by Bitmain, one of the largest crypto mining hardware manufacturers in the world. The company's CEO, Leo Lu, in fact, served as a director at Bitmain where he co-founded the cloud-mining business. Bitmain invested in BitFuFu in 2021 before committing to another $70 million in investments through a PIPE structure in 2022 in partnership with AntPool. BitFuFu's close ties to Bitmain are likely to help the company secure a stable supply of advanced Bitcoin miners in the foreseeable future. In 2024, Bitmain was indeed the largest supplier for BitFuFu. Exhibit 2: BitFuFu's milestones Investor presentation Although based out of Singapore, North America accounts for the largest market for BitFuFu. In 2024, North America accounted for just over 51% of revenue, while Asia and Europe contributed 31% and 13% of revenue, respectively. BitFuFu's Growth Strategy Ticks All Boxes As a Bitcoin miner, BitFuFu's growth depends on a few variables. Increasing the overall hash rate is one of the primary drivers of revenue. A higher total hash rate opens doors for higher Bitcoin rewards from self-mining and subscription fees from packaged cloud mining solutions. The company has entered into agreements with Bitmain for large-scale purchases of advanced mining equipment, which is an important step in the process. A two-year agreement with Bitmain allows BitFuFu to purchase up to 80,000 S-series miners, which includes the latest models such as S21 XP and S21 Pro. According to the company management, this planned acquisition of mining equipment alone will add up to 16 EH/s to its hash rate. I am also encouraged by the payment terms BitFuFu has secured with Bitmain which allows the company to pay for a portion of the total due with its common equity and also defer some cash payments until after the delivery of mining equipment. In its monthly update for April, BitFuFu reported a 37% MoM increase in hash rate to 28.3 EH/s, which came on the back of increased hash power procurement from suppliers. I believe this marks the beginning of a phase where the company will see strong momentum in hash rate growth, setting up the stage for robust revenue growth in the long run. Expanding access to data center facilities also plays a key role in long-term growth. BitFuFu has made progress on this front too. For instance, last February, the company announced the acquisition of a majority stake in a 51 MW Bitcoin mining data center in Oklahoma. BitFuFu, as confirmed in February, is planning to deploy highly efficient AntMiner S21 series models at this data center, effectively bringing the average cash cost to mine one Bitcoin to just $18,000 excluding depreciation. The site also operates at a very competitive electricity cost of just 3 cents per kilowatt-hour. This acquisition is projected to add 3 EH/s to the total managed hash rate of the company. In April, BitFuFu's total power capacity under management increased almost 19% MoM to 566 MW. This suggests that the company is well on track to meet its ambitious goal of reaching 1 GW of global capacity by the end of 2026. The company has also signed 10-year lease agreements for two U.S.-based mining facilities with a combined capacity of 33 MW. Since electricity is one of the biggest expenses for a Bitcoin miner, BitFuFu remains focused on lowering its power costs by strategically maintaining mining hubs in low-cost regions. As part of this strategy, the company recently acquired a stake in a facility in Ethiopia with an estimated electricity cost of 3.6 cents per kWh. Exhibit 3: BitFuFu's hashrate network Investor presentation BitFuFu is also investing in improving the underlying technology supporting its business, which, I believe, is the right way forward. Better technology leads to lower downtime and lower maintenance costs, which ensures that the hash rate is consistently productive. The Aladdin system, as noted earlier, can efficiently manage a very large number of miners (more than 100,000,000 simultaneously), and the company has focused on enhancing the mining platform user experience to attract and retain customers. Tech investments can indirectly improve the overall mining efficiency as well, which is evident from how BitFuFuOS optimized 9.7 EH/s of hashrate in April alone. BitFuFu also ticks Bitcoin treasury functionality as the company, as outlined in its annual report, is strategically holding Bitcoin for operational and financial purposes. As of April, the company held 1,908 Bitcoin, valued at almost $200 million at today's BTC price of over $103K. At a market cap of just $600 million, BitFuFu is trading around three times the value of its Bitcoin holding. BitFuFu Is On Track For Stellar Operating Income Growth I did a simple exercise to project BitFuFu's operating income for the next two financial years (2025 and 2026). Any valuation/projection model is prone to errors, and it's nearly impossible to get it right. So the idea behind this model was not to predict the future, but to get a basic understanding of what we are dealing with. I have made several critical assumptions in this model to estimate hash rate growth, including the phased deployment of advanced miners and a 60% annual increase in Bitcoin network difficulty. Other key assumptions include: Self-mining cost of a Bitcoin is expected to average $22,000 in 2025 and $24,000 in 2026. Cloud mining gross margin of 7% (compared to 6.2% in 2024). Hosting & Other segment gross margin of 2%, similar to 2024. Removal of stock-based compensation from operating expenses for simplification. Hash rate allocation of 30% for self-mining, 60% for cloud mining, and 10% for hosting and other services. The table below summarizes the key findings in my model. Metric 2025 2026 Notes Hash rate 38 60 Based on the April 2025 actual numbers, the phased Bitmain deal, and facility expansions. - Self-Mining EH/s (30%) 11.4 18 - Cloud-Mining EH/s (60%) 22.8 36 - Hosting/Other EH/s (10%) 3.8 6 Average BTC price $85,000 $100,000 BTC mined per average EH/s/Year ~220 ~130 Assuming 60% annual Bitcoin network difficulty Revenue Projections Self-mining revenue (millions) $213.2 $234 Cloud mining revenue (millions) $433.2 $720 Selling of mining equipment (millions) $25 $25 Hosting & Other (millions) $7 $10 Total revenue (millions) $678.4 $989 Cost of revenue projections Self-mining costs (millions) ($55.2) ($56.2) Cloud mining costs (millions) ($402.9) ($662.4) Selling equipment costs (millions) ($22.5) ($22.5) Hosting & Other costs (millions) ($6.9) ($9.8) Depreciation and amortization (millions) ($40) ($60) Total cost of revenue (millions) ($527.5) ($810.9) Gross profit (millions) $150.9 $178.1 Gross profit margin 22.2% 18% Operating expenses (millions) ($27.1) ($39.6) Pre-SBC operating income $123.8 $138.5 Operating margin 18.2% 14% BitFuFu has already showcased its potential by bringing in more revenue than some established mining companies such as Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) and CleanSpark ( CLSK ) in 2024, and I believe the company is well-positioned to see strong operating income growth in the next couple of years. Exhibit 4: BitFuFu vs peers Investor presentation At a P/S multiple of around 1, I find BitFuFu very attractively valued compared to 5.5 for Riot Platforms, 6.8 for Core Scientific ( CORZ ), and 7 for MARA Holdings ( MARA ). One possible reason for BitFuFu's cheap valuation is the company's Singapore origins and the absence of a hype factor. However, since investing is not about getting behind the most hyped companies, FUFU stock seems an attractive bet on the crypto economy. Takeaway BitFuFu is a hidden gem in the Bitcoin mining sector. This Singapore-based company with close ties to Bitmain has performed well in the past couple of years and is on the verge of reporting strong revenue and operating income growth. At a substantially cheap valuation compared to other established Bitcoin mining companies, BitFuFu stock offers a sufficient margin of safety to bet on the crypto economy.",FUFU,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-05-14 09:43:11

She cited rising geopolitical uncertainty and persistent market volatility as primary factors behind the shift. Investors, traditionally concentrated in US-centric assets, are now seeking broader exposure across alternative asset classes, including crypto, commodities and other currencies. Lo said “volatility is definitely here to stay,” prompting clients to rebalance toward perceived safe havens and growth opportunities in new regions. China, after years of muted interest, is also regaining traction among the ultra-wealthy.

Two of the criminals are now facing adult charges. These incidents follow the broader trend of physical ”wrench attacks” on crypto holders, and there is now an urgent need for better personal security in the crypto space. Meanwhile, Eric Council Jr., who was involved in a 2024 SIM swap hack of the SEC’s X account that temporarily disrupted Bitcoin markets, is now awaiting sentencing. Crypto Industry Rocked by Foiled Kidnapping in Paris On May 13, three masked men attacked the daughter and grandson of Pierre Noizat, the co-founder and CEO of French crypto exchange Paymium, as they walked in the 11th district. Accompanied by a male partner, Noizat’s daughter was reportedly assaulted in a bid to force her and her child into a van. However, she resisted fiercely, and impressively managed to take a gun from one of the attackers and throw it away. The male partner was injured while trying to intervene. The attack was ultimately foiled by the intervention of passersby, which forced the assailants to flee in the vehicle, which was later found nearby. All three victims sustained injuries and were hospitalized. French media reported that the case is now under investigation by the Brigade for the Suppression of Banditry, a specialized police unit. Naturally the incident caused alarm in the cryptocurrency community. Michael Englander , CEO of Polish crypto exchange Plasbit, condemned the act and warned people in the industry against publicly flaunting their crypto wealth. He suggested that such behavior can endanger their families. The attack adds to the now growing list of offline, crypto-linked crimes that raised some serious concerns across the industry. Crypto lawyer Sasha Hodder said that theft tactics are shifting beyond digital hacks to physical violence. Earlier in January, David Balland, co-founder of Ledger, was kidnapped and held overnight until a police raid secured his release. Jameson Lopp, co-founder of self-custody firm Casa, documented 22 in-person crypto-related attacks in 2025 alone on GitHub. A University of Cambridge study also pointed out that such “wrench attacks”—where victims are coerced into surrendering their crypto—are often underreported, and they typically involve not just organized crime but also acquaintances of the victims. Overall, it is becoming increasingly clear that there is a very serious need for heightened personal security, both online and off. Crypto Organizer Abducted and Robbed in Las Vegas Another disturbing incident involving the kidnapping and robbery of a crypto event organizer recently came to light months after it occurred in Las Vegas. According to local law enforcement and a May 10 report by 8 News Now, three teenagers abducted a man at gunpoint shortly after he returned home from hosting a cryptocurrency-related event in downtown Las Vegas in November. The suspects forced the victim into a vehicle and drove him about an hour outside the city to a remote desert location, where they threatened his life and claimed to have his father in custody. (Source: 8 News Now ) Under duress, the victim was forced to hand over access credentials to his cryptocurrency wallets and NFT holdings. The assailants made it clear that noncompliance would lead to fatal consequences. At one point, a fourth unidentified individual reportedly gave instructions over a speakerphone during the attack, which suggests that it was a coordinated attack beyond just the three present teens. After the criminals drained approximately $4 million worth of digital assets from his accounts, the victim was abandoned in the desert. He trekked five miles on foot to reach a gas station, where he contacted a friend for help. The case is now advancing through the legal system, with two 16-year-olds from Florida facing charges of robbery, kidnapping, and extortion. One is being held on $4 million bail, while the other is under house arrest with electronic monitoring. A third suspect reportedly fled the country. Prosecutors confirmed that the two detained suspects will be tried as adults, and a preliminary hearing is scheduled for June. (Source: 8 News Now ) This incident also adds to a worrying pattern of violent, real-world crimes targeting individuals in the cryptocurrency sector. Just days earlier in Paris, French police rescued the father of a crypto entrepreneur who was kidnapped and held for ransom worth €7 million. Earlier in the year, a UK-based crypto broker escaped an abduction attempt by leaping from a 30-foot balcony to avoid being tortured for €30,000 in crypto. There is a clear shift in how criminals are pursuing digital assets—not just online, but through increasingly dangerous physical attacks. SEC Hacker Faces Sentencing X account hijackings are also fast becoming a major issue for the crypto space. Eric Council Jr., the person who helped orchestrate a hack of the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) official X account, is now facing sentencing after his guilty plea to conspiracy charges. His legal team filed a motion on May 13 requesting that Council receive a sentence of no more than one year and one day in prison, which was a counterproposal to the two-year sentence that was requested by federal prosecutors. The sentencing will be decided by US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson during a hearing that is scheduled for May 16. The high-profile incident took place in 2024 when Council and his associates gained unauthorized access to the SEC’s X account through a SIM swap attack. Once in control of the account, they posted a fraudulent message falsely claiming that the SEC approved the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The fake post caused a brief but chaotic spike in Bitcoin’s price before markets realized the message was not authentic. The SEC quickly regained control of the account and confirmed that no approval actually took place. Council initially pleaded not guilty but later changed his plea in February by admitting to one count of conspiracy to commit aggravated identity theft and access device fraud. According to court documents, he earned approximately $50,000 from similar SIM swap schemes. His legal counsel argued that the proposed twelve-month sentence would be more than enough to serve justice, deter future misconduct, and uphold respect for the law. They acknowledge that Council’s role, while serious, did not warrant the full two years sought by prosecutors. On May 8, President Donald Trump announced that Fox News host Jeanine Pirro would be named interim US attorney for the District of Columbia. While unrelated to Council’s case, the announcement could signal a shift in how crypto-related crimes are prosecuted moving forward.",News|Security,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-14 10:00:00

In Washington, Senators Cynthia Lummis and Bernie Moreno are urging the Treasury Department to revise how corporate crypto holdings are taxed under the Inflation Reduction Act, arguing it could unfairly penalize US companies. Meanwhile in Arizona, Governor Katie Hobbs has vetoed multiple bills that would have expanded the state’s role in digital asset investment, instead opting for a consumer protection-focused law targeting Bitcoin ATMs. US Senators Urge Treasury to Revise Crypto Tax Rule as Stablecoin Bill Hangs in Balance Two US senators are ramping up pressure on Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to revise a controversial tax provision that could significantly impact companies holding digital assets. In a letter dated May 12, Senators Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) and Bernie Moreno (R-OH) urged the Treasury Department to modify how corporate crypto holdings are taxed under the Inflation Reduction Act — a move they argue is crucial for preserving America's edge in the rapidly evolving digital finance sector. A Push to Reinterpret Corporate Tax Rules for Crypto The core of the senators’ request revolves around the definition of “adjusted financial statement income,” which plays a pivotal role in determining tax liability under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), signed into law in 2022 and enacted in 2023. The IRA introduced a 15% minimum corporate tax for firms posting profits above $1 billion for three consecutive years. According to Lummis and Moreno, the current interpretation of this provision could result in companies being taxed on unrealized gains in digital assets — a move they claim is both unfair and economically damaging. “Our edge in digital finance is at risk if US companies are taxed more than foreign competitors,” Lummis said in a May 13 post on X, echoing a growing sentiment among pro-crypto lawmakers that current tax policy is stifling innovation and driving business overseas. In their letter, the senators urged Bessent to act within the Treasury’s authority to revise the definition without requiring new legislation. The move could provide immediate relief to crypto-focused companies and corporations that allocate a portion of their treasuries to digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The appeal from Lummis and Moreno comes at a time when crypto policy is becoming increasingly entwined with US politics. Moreno, a freshman senator backed heavily by crypto-aligned political action committees in the 2024 election, has joined Lummis as a vocal supporter of blockchain innovation and regulatory clarity. His election was buoyed by roughly $40 million in crypto PAC funding, signaling the sector’s growing influence in Washington. The letter also follows recent moves by other US states and lawmakers to either advance or restrict crypto activity. In Arizona, Governor Katie Hobbs recently vetoed two pro-crypto bills while approving strict regulation of Bitcoin ATMs, showcasing the fragmented regulatory environment across states. Stablecoin Regulation at a Standstill The call for tax relief also coincides with ongoing legislative efforts to regulate stablecoins at the federal level. The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act — or GENIUS Act — remains stalled in the Senate after a failed motion on May 8. Democratic opposition, partly driven by concerns over former President Donald Trump’s crypto affiliations, blocked the bill’s advancement, despite bipartisan support. Senator Lummis , a co-sponsor of the GENIUS Act, said she remains committed to its passage, emphasizing the importance of regulatory frameworks that foster innovation while protecting consumers. The bill is expected to be reintroduced for a vote in the coming days, though its fate remains uncertain amid continued partisan division. If the Treasury accepts the senators’ recommendation, the change could be a watershed moment for corporate crypto adoption in the US, potentially removing a significant tax burden and encouraging more Fortune 500 companies to allocate capital to digital assets. Conversely, failure to act could accelerate the offshoring of crypto businesses to more favorable jurisdictions, a trend already evident as firms seek clarity and cost efficiency outside of US borders. With the 2024 presidential election season still echoing into 2025 and Congress deeply divided on crypto’s future, the next few weeks may prove pivotal. Whether it’s reinterpreting a tax provision or passing long-awaited stablecoin legislation, the direction taken by US lawmakers and regulators will likely shape the country’s digital asset landscape for years to come. Arizona Governor Vetoes Key Crypto Bills but Signs Tough Bitcoin ATM Regulation Meanwhile, Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs has drawn a firm line on the state’s approach to cryptocurrency regulation, vetoing two high-profile bills aimed at expanding Arizona’s involvement in digital assets, while signing a strict consumer protection bill targeting Bitcoin ATM operations. The decisions, made over the course of May, mark a mixed message from Hobbs’ administration — simultaneously curbing bold state-level crypto adoption plans while tightening oversight on retail access points. On May 12, Governor Hobbs vetoed Senate Bill 1373, which would have established a Digital Assets Strategic Reserve Fund. The fund was designed to allow Arizona to hold cryptocurrencies acquired through state seizures or legislative allocations. In her veto letter, Hobbs cited the market's inherent instability as a primary reason for rejecting the bill. “Current volatility in cryptocurrency markets does not make a prudent fit for general fund dollars,” she wrote, adding that existing legislation already allows the state to utilize digital assets without putting taxpayer money at risk. Just days earlier, on May 3, Hobbs rejected Senate Bill 1025, titled the Arizona Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act. That more aggressive proposal sought to authorize the state to invest up to 10% of its treasury and retirement funds in Bitcoin and other digital assets — a move that would have positioned Arizona as one of the most crypto-forward states in the US. Also denied was Senate Bill 1024, which would have allowed Arizona state agencies to accept cryptocurrencies as payment for taxes, fines, and fees through vetted service providers. Despite the bill’s structure insulating the state from direct exposure to crypto volatility, Hobbs maintained it presented “too much risk.” These decisions come amid a broader national trend. According to bitcoinlaws.io, 26 US states have introduced legislation proposing strategic crypto reserves, and 18 of those efforts remain active. Arizona's withdrawals signal a more cautious route, contrasting sharply with lawmakers and governors in states like Texas and Wyoming, where crypto adoption is accelerating. States and their strategic Bitcoin reserves (Source: Bitcoinlaws ) Hobbs Signs Tough Bitcoin ATM Law In contrast to her vetoes, Hobbs approved House Bill 2387 on May 12, marking a significant regulatory expansion targeting cryptocurrency kiosks — commonly known as Bitcoin ATMs. The law introduces several key consumer protection measures: Mandatory multilingual warnings about crypto scams displayed on kiosks Required user acknowledgement of risks before transactions Itemized receipts including transaction data, contact info, fees, and refund policies Daily transaction limits: $2,000 for new customers; $10,500 for returning users after 10 days 24/7 toll-free customer service with contact numbers posted clearly on all machines Full refunds for fraud victims who report the scam within 30 days and provide proof The new regulation aims to curb rising fraud linked to Bitcoin ATMs, which have gained popularity in low-income and immigrant communities. Arizona currently hosts around 20 active crypto ATMs, according to CoinATMRadar. Despite her recent vetoes, Governor Hobbs has not completely closed the door on digital asset integration within the state. On May 14, she signed House Bill 2749, which updates Arizona’s unclaimed property statutes to reflect the growing presence of digital assets. The bill allows the state to retain unclaimed cryptocurrencies in their original digital form, rather than converting them to fiat upon seizure — a forward-thinking measure that aligns with evolving norms in asset custody. This decision reflects a more moderate stance, acknowledging digital assets as a legitimate form of property while keeping speculative exposure at arm’s length. A Measured Path Amid a Divided National Landscape Governor Hobbs’ approach reflects a growing political fault line over cryptocurrency adoption. On one side are legislators and governors — like those in Florida, Texas, and Ohio — advocating for proactive investment and integration. On the other are policymakers, like Hobbs, who favor tight regulatory frameworks and a wait-and-see approach, especially in light of recent market turbulence and fraud concerns. While Arizona may not be leading the charge into crypto investment, it is clearly seeking to define a regulatory environment that protects consumers and adapts to the realities of blockchain-based finance. With crypto’s role in state-level finance, taxation, and consumer protection continuing to evolve, Arizona’s decisions could serve as a blueprint — or a cautionary tale — for other states navigating the digital asset frontier.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-14 10:00:00

The Israel-based firm and its existing shareholders sold more than 11.92 million shares in total, according to a May 13 press release . Trading is set to commence on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on May 14 under the ticker symbol ETOR. eToro IPO Details The revised offering significantly surpasses eToro’s earlier goal of raising $500 million through the sale of 10 million shares priced between $46 and $50. Of the 11.92 million shares now being offered, over 5.9 million are from eToro itself, while the remaining shares are being offloaded by select early investors. The share sale will remain open until at least May 15. This IPO marks a key milestone for eToro as it moves to compete directly with publicly traded rivals like Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD), whose stock has surged over 67% so far in 2025, according to data from Google Finance. eToro first confidentially filed for a public offering with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January, before officially announcing its intentions on March 24. A Rising Tide of Crypto IPOs eToro public market entry coincides with a growing wave of IPO activity across the fintech and crypto industries. Digital banking startup Chime also intends to list on the Nasdaq under the ticker CHY, although its share price and offering size are yet to be finalized. Analysts at Renaissance Capital estimate that Chime’s IPO could raise as much as $1 billion. Meanwhile, several prominent crypto firms are eyeing their own stock market debuts. U.S.-based crypto exchange Kraken is reportedly preparing for an IPO later this year. Stablecoin issuer Circle also filed for a public offering on April 1, but later paused its plans following global market volatility triggered by tariff announcements from former President Donald Trump on April 2. Crypto custodian BitGo is another name in the mix , having recently launched a global over-the-counter digital asset trading desk in February. BitGo is expected to go public before the end of the year. According to a December 2024 prediction by Bitwise, at least five crypto unicorns are likely to go public in 2025—including Circle, Kraken, Anchorage Digital, Chainalysis, and Figure.

According to him, Dogecoin is displaying what he called “perfect price structure”—a rare quality among altcoins. “You get this bottom, you get the double bottom, you get the bullish divergence. Bang,” he said while showcasing recent price action and comparing it to prior cycles. “Then again—you get the bottom, the double bottom, the bullish divergence. Bang. This is literally the same thing all over again.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Hits Critical Zone—Here’s What 3 Leading Analysts Are Watching Kevin’s view is built on strong historical confluence and Fibonacci retracement zones. He noted that Dogecoin’s last major bull cycle saw the token top out at precisely the 1.618 to 1.703 Fibonacci extension range. By replicating the same fib structure from the most recent bottom, Kevin identified a similar target range between $1.10 and $1.25, calling it a “real deal price target” rather than clickbait. “Could $1.10 to $1.25 be the next target for Doge?” he asked. “I think if we can replicate a move like we did back in November—which we can, and if anything, we can do way better—then absolutely. That’s the zone I’m watching.” He further emphasized that the golden pocket and the 1.703 fib extension mark a crucial resistance area, just as they did in Dogecoin’s previous cycle. “Remember this,” Kevin said. “You run your fib—boom—Dogecoin tops out right at the golden pocket and the 1.703 fib. We’re seeing the same thing lineup here.” Zooming out, Kevin placed Dogecoin’s strength in the broader context of a shifting crypto macro environment. Bitcoin dominance, he noted, is dropping sharply from the macro 0.786 Fibonacci level—a move that typically allows altcoins like Dogecoin to catch a stronger bid. “We are seeing exactly what we said would happen. That is: altcoins catching a bid. A really nice bid,” he remarked. Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Realistically Reach $1? Analyst Sees Strong Setup The bullish sentiment extends beyond Dogecoin. Kevin noted that macroeconomic data is supportive, with declining inflation, rising GDP, strong labor markets, and easing tariff fears contributing to renewed confidence across financial markets. “Everything seems to be lining up at the exact right time,” he said. “We’ve got the macro on our side, we’ve got the technicals on our side, and now even Dogecoin is flashing green.” Still, he added a caveat of caution. “In the short term, just be a little cautious until we break the resistance we need to break,” Kevin said, referencing the broader crypto market’s proximity to key Fibonacci and moving average thresholds. “Treat resistance as resistance—until it’s not.” Nonetheless, Kevin concluded that Dogecoin’s current setup is as strong as it’s been in years. “This is just perfect, perfect price structure,” he reiterated. “When the market gets going, I think this thing’s going to perform massively.” His final message: if history rhymes, Dogecoin could be poised for a powerful move to surpass the psychological $1 mark. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.242.

Cryptocurrency exchange MEXC has completed a security audit conducted by Web3 cybersecurity firm Hacken. The assessment found no critical or high-risk vulnerabilities in the platform’s mobile application, according to a summary of the report shared by the company. The audit, based on Hacken’s penetration testing methodology, evaluated the app’s resistance to external attacks and potential exploitation. All previously identified low-risk issues were reportedly addressed before the final report was issued. Hacken noted that the MEXC platform demonstrated compliance with standard security protocols and emphasized a user-centric app design that balances functionality with protection. Key areas reviewed included trading execution systems, data handling processes, and fund transfer mechanisms. MEXC’s Chief Operating Officer Tracy Jin said in a statement that third-party audits are “an essential part of maintaining user trust and ensuring accountability.” The exchange has recently taken several steps aimed at improving transparency and infrastructure security. Earlier this year, MEXC released an independently verified Proof of Reserves report showing that the majority of user assets are stored in cold wallets. The company has also launched a $30 million venture initiative called IgniteX to support early-stage Web3 projects. MEXC is among several exchanges responding to increased scrutiny from regulators and institutional stakeholders, many of whom are placing greater emphasis on verifiable security and operational integrity in the wake of past industry failures.

The billionaire has scaled back on his activities at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initiative in Washington to focus on his company administrative duties. In his remarks to an audience of investors and dignitaries in Riyadh, Musk said he thinks “we’re headed to a radically different world.” “Ultimately, there will be tens of billions of humanoid robots,” he explained, calling them assistants that could help economies increase their productivity exponentially. “The output of an economy is productivity per capita times population. With humanoid robots, productivity becomes virtually unlimited.” Musk: AI and robotics increase universal income Musk proposed that artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics could lead the world to a “universal high income,” where scarcity is eliminated and everyone has access to any goods or services they desire. 🚨 BREAKING: Elon Musk's Full Interview from the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum today. pic.twitter.com/6Yyt34vBKP — DogeDesigner (@cb_doge) May 13, 2025 Still, the Tesla CEO contrasted his optimistic sentiment with a reference to films like Terminator as warnings of what could go wrong if AI is mishandled . “A Star Trek future would be great,” he said, calling for innovation that is responsible. Responding to questions from the forum moderator about Saudi Arabia’s goals to improve productivity through automation, Musk said: “ You can think of future cars as robots on four wheels. It would be very exciting to have autonomous vehicles here in the Kingdom, if you’re amenable .” The billionaire also discussed his AI venture, xAI, asserting that the company is developing general-purpose AI, committed to truth-seeking. “ The goal of xAI is to understand the universe ,” he continued, “W here did it come from? Where is it going? What questions don’t we even know to ask?” He framed the company’s mission as rooted in scientific curiosity, explaining that once the right questions are formulated, “the answers are usually the easy par t.” DOGE Caucus in disarray, Congress says its ‘dying’ Back in Washington, DC, the congressional DOGE Caucus, once intended to support Musk’s federally-endorsed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), is falling apart with his “absence.” Speaking in a Tuesday interview with Politico, Rep. Jared Moskowitz, the first Democrat to join the group, said the DOGE caucus “is dead and defunct.” “ We haven’t met in months. We only had two total meetings in five months .” Moskowitz confirmed. The DOGE Caucus backs Musk and his team in their initiative to eliminate government waste, fraud, and inefficiency through the newly established commission. It was billed as a bipartisan coordination for streamlining federal operations. “ There doesn’t appear to be any communication between what Elon is doing and the caucus. Congress is behind and being left out ,” he argued. “ We weren’t involved at all in anything. Zero. Zilch. Nada. Musk did it all on his own .” Conflicting messages on efficiency Moskowitz didn’t hold back in lambasting the commission’s lack of progress. “ DOGE was a complete failure. Complete failure. Nothing has been made more efficient, ” he told Politico . He mentioned the two-week long communication outages at the Newark Liberty International Airport, in addition to delays and staffing issues as evidence that DOGE had “failed to deliver on its promises.” On Sunday morning, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) temporarily halted all flights bound for the airport due to a “telecommunications issue” with the air traffic controllers at Philadelphia TRACON Area C. Yet, not all members of the caucus agree with that assessment. Rep. Aaron Bean, a co-chair of the group, insisted the caucus is “just getting started,” in a written statement. “ Congress can enact long-term change ,” Bean said, propounding that 100 committed members and eight specialized working groups are currently drafting bills to unlock savings for taxpayers.

While Bitcoin and Ethereum keep pulling headlines, other coins are showing real growth. A mix of smart design, tech upgrades, and ecosystem activity is fueling this new wave. Coins like BlockDAG, Cosmos, Aptos, and Celestia are rising fast. They offer unique tech, strong communities, and big plans for the year. These names are already showing price action and on-chain progress. Whether it’s BlockDAG’s network strength or Celestia’s modular structure, these cryptos are making moves. Let’s look at what makes them the top crypto gems of 2025. BlockDAG – $246M Raised and Growing Ecosystem BlockDAG stands out among crypto gems with over $246 million raised and 20.1 billion BDAG coins sold. Its Batch 28 is priced at $0.0262, offering a 2,520% gain from early stages. The launch price is set at $0.05, and demand keeps climbing. It runs on a unique mix of Proof-of-Work and DAG, supporting thousands of transactions per second. CertiK has already completed its audit. Over 17,440 miners are in circulation, driving early adoption. Miner sales have crossed $7 million. Meanwhile, the X1 app has surpassed 1 million users, and the beta testnet is already active. BlockDAG isn’t stopping there. The team is going global, linking up with Inter Milan and appearing at global tech events. Centralized exchange listings and a mainnet launch are both scheduled for 2025. Many other coins are still rebuilding, but BlockDAG is pushing ahead. If you’re eyeing crypto gems that are still in the early phase, BlockDAG is a strong candidate. Its scale, tech, and user numbers all suggest it’s gearing up for a big run once listed. Cosmos – Bitbank Listing Brings Liquidity Cosmos has landed a major win with its Bitbank listing, going live on May 13. Bitbank is one of Japan’s leading exchanges, and this move opens up liquidity from Asia. ATOM now trades at $5.09, with support near $10.50 and resistance at $12.00. A recent 4.5% rally shows market interest returning. Cosmos is more than just price. It’s building solid tech. The SDK v0.53.0 upgrade lets developers scale apps more easily across the IBC ecosystem. Cosmos powers many chains behind the scenes. This quiet strength is what makes Cosmos a real crypto gem. If the Bitbank listing brings new traffic and fresh apps to its network, it could gain fast. Cosmos is worth watching if you want crypto gems that offer long-term value and strong infrastructure. Aptos – Volume Rises, DeFi Grows Aptos has jumped 4.7%, reaching $8.92 by May 11. Even more notable is the rise in trading volume, which points to steady buying pressure. Aptos now supports more than 2.7 billion transactions. It also sees 18 million monthly users and runs on 490 active nodes. What makes Aptos one of the rising crypto gems is its mix of speed, security, and growing user base. It’s one of the fastest Layer 1 chains and puts a strong focus on performance. Adding to the momentum is OKX’s DeFi Season, running from May 17 to June 16. It offers up to 18% APY on Aptos-linked platforms. That could attract more liquidity and keep user activity high. With better tech and strong incentives, Aptos is making its way into the list of top crypto gems. It has the structure and support needed to build on recent gains. Celestia – Upbit Listing Lifts TIA Price Celestia just saw a 13% jump in price after its listing on Upbit, South Korea’s largest exchange. The listing included BTC, USDT, and KRW pairs, boosting the price of TIA to $3.25. Analysts expect a further rise to $3.77, which is a 16% climb from current levels. This modular chain is doing things differently. Celestia separates consensus from execution, making it easier for others to build specific-use chains on top of it. That design is drawing serious attention. With fresh volume from new listings and a structure that supports scaling, Celestia is one of the crypto gems to watch this year. It’s lightweight, fast, and perfect for Web3 growth. If modular chains take off in 2025, Celestia could be at the center. It’s gaining traction now and may offer solid upside for those looking at technical progress and real exchange support. Final Take on Crypto Gems with Real Strength This May, attention is turning fast toward platforms that break the mold. BlockDAG, with its $246 million presale and unique PoW-DAG design, is pulling in millions of users even before its mainnet launch. Celestia is proving how far modular chains can go. Meanwhile, Cosmos and Aptos are steadily advancing with strong frameworks already in place. These aren’t just trending names, they’re pushing real results. If you’re scanning the crypto gems with 100x potential, now’s not the time to wait. BlockDAG remains in its early growth phase. Cosmos is tapping into fresh markets. Aptos is ramping up its user count and liquidity. Celestia’s exchange activity is heating up. Don’t overlook them, because when the mainstream catches on, the best gains may already be out of reach.

The Institute of International Finance (IIF) recently highlighted XRP as a faster and cheaper alternative for moving money across borders, especially in areas underserved by traditional banks. XRP acts as a bridge asset, enabling near-instant settlements without relying on multiple banking intermediaries. IIF Mentions Ripple in BIS Response In this January consultation with the BIS, the The Institute of International Finance (IIF) responded how to bolster crossborder payments.

In this document, Ripple and XRP were acknowledged for offering a new kind of infrastructure for value transfer, breaking away from the delays and high costs of the traditional banking model. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ex-SEC Chair Gensler Wasn’t Anti-Crypto in Private, McHenry Reveals , Stablecoins Get a Nod — But Not RLUSD Yet The IIF’s paper also touched on the role of stablecoins like USDC from Circle, PayPal’s PYUSD, and Coinbase’s Base blockchain, all noted for enabling fast, affordable international payments. However, Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD didn’t make the list, most likely because it had just launched in December 2024, shortly before the document was submitted. Since then, RLUSD has been integrated into Ripple Payments, adding more utility to Ripple’s suite of tools. Ripple’s Wider Recognition Keeps Growing This isn’t the first time Ripple and XRP have gotten praise. Last year, Mastercard spotlighted SBI Remit, a Ripple partner, for using XRP in remittances. XRP was also highlighted in a World Bank report and mentioned by both the IMF and World Economic Forum as a useful tool for unlocking capital tied up in outdated financial systems. Even Morgan Stanley has named Ripple a potential SWIFT alternative . Although RLUSD missed the spotlight this time, Ripple and XRP are gaining momentum in international finance. With institutional recognition growing and blockchain adoption accelerating, Ripple’s cross-border payment tech is no longer flying under the radar. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In a recent interview, he broke down two major moves: a new lending product at Strike and the launch of a separate public company, 21, that aims to bring Bitcoin to traditional capital markets in a serious way. Strike Lending now lets users borrow against their Bitcoin at a 50% loan-to-value ratio, starting at 12% APR. There are two loan structures: pay interest monthly or opt for ""payment at maturity,"" where you pay everything at the end of the term at 13% APR. Most importantly, Strike does not rehypothecate customer Bitcoin , meaning collateral is never reused for other purposes—a strong response to concerns after past industry failures. Mallers emphasizes that the product is for people who want liquidity without selling Bitcoin and incurring capital gains taxes. Customers have already used loans for everything from medical emergencies to stacking more BTC. While 12% may seem high compared to traditional options, Mallers says that’s due to the immaturity of Bitcoin lending markets. The goal is to bring rates down over time , ideally to single digits, as capital providers better understand Bitcoin’s strength as collateral. Then there's 21 , Mallers’ new company co-founded with Tether. 21 plans to go public under ticker XXI through a SPAC merger with Caner Equity Partners. With over 42,000 BTC in treasury, 21 is positioning itself as a “pure-play” Bitcoin company that offers not just exposure but also Bitcoin-native business models—like financial services and lending. Mallers made it clear: Strike and 21 are separate companies , though both align with his lifelong mission to push Bitcoin forward. 21 will focus on building Bitcoin-native revenue streams, unlike other treasury-heavy companies that rely on legacy business models. He believes the market wants a Bitcoin-focused company that’s large enough to matter but still early-stage enough to grow. As for critics wary of institutional involvement, Mallers argues Bitcoin is open to everyone— even BlackRock . The protocol doesn’t discriminate, and trying to exclude others runs counter to its ethos. In fact, he sees increasing institutional participation as a natural evolution—and one that will ultimately benefit everyone. On the macro side, Mallers believes we’re unwinding a century-old monetary regime and that Bitcoin is poised to benefit from fiat instability , particularly as governments continue to print and financial institutions demand more leverage to stay afloat. His message to Bitcoiners: “You don’t have to sell your Bitcoin. Let it work for you.

44605522,https://crypto.news/?p=14379045,1747217225,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/44605522.jpeg,"In 2025, crypto firms go public in record numbers | Opinion",https://crypto.news/in-2025-crypto-firms-go-public-in-record-numbers/,"Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news’ editorial. Traditional stock markets are home to some of the most successful and innovative companies in the world. Yet, the giants of the crypto sector—those at the forefront of digital finance innovation—have remained conspicuously absent. I believe that’s about to change. In 2025, we’ll see more crypto firms secure IPOs than ever before. You might also like: The moment for mass adoption is here, and crypto’s still not ready | Opinion That’s because the sector is undergoing immense transformation. After years of being sidelined and avoided by institutional investors who lacked confidence in cryptocurrencies, the sun is now shining brightly on digital assets. Why IPOs were elusive until now Before now, multiple hurdles have blocked the path to listing for crypto firms and kept them from getting IPOs off the ground. The road to floating is paved with intense regulatory scrutiny from government agencies and bodies that have historically looked upon cryptocurrencies with skepticism at best and, at worst, disdain. Questions over the classification of these assets and who is ultimately responsible for them have tied up progress and made the pathway to floating far more complicated. The lack of a clear legal framework left too much room for uncertainty and ultimately slowed progress. That’s made clear by the fact that only one major crypto firm has successfully gained a place on a traditional stock market. That company was Coinbase, and they took another route to floating altogether. Instead of a traditional IPO, Coinbase secured its spot via a direct public offering, circumventing the need for institutional investors to come on board and avoiding the full weight of heavy regulatory and disclosure burdens. Coinbase took this alternative route in 2021, but we’re looking at a drastically different environment in 2025 – an environment that will inspire a wave of crypto IPOs. Institutional investors are now onboard First, IPOs require a greater buy-in from institutional investors, and that’s already in place. With heavyweight asset managers such as Fidelity and BlackRock building up their crypto services throughout the 2020s, and the SEC approving spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) and then spot Ethereum ( ETH ) ETFs in 2024, according to Bloomberg , institutional investors have now built up cryptocurrency exposure. In fact, many now embrace digital assets. This positive approach from institutional investors clears one hurdle to crypto firm IPOs, and another is steadily coming down, too. A friendlier regulatory environment Since the beginning of the year, the harsh glare of US regulatory bodies, namely the SEC, has eased off. With Gary Gensler, who was no friend to the crypto sector, out and the pro-crypto Paul Atkins in as Chair , we’re sure to see looser regulation. We’re already seeing this new normal take hold. Since the start of the year, the SEC has dropped cases against some of the biggest names in the industry, including the likes of Coinbase, Robinhood, and Ripple. The Department of Justice has taken a step back, too. It has disbanded its cryptocurrency-focused unit, handing the reins back to regulatory bodies to end “a reckless strategy of regulation by prosecution.” There are now fewer layers of complicated bureaucracy and intense scrutiny tying up crypto firms that wish to float. Firms are also set to get more clarity over their regulatory position and responsibilities going forward—the very clarity they need when considering filing for an IPO. The SEC has launched the Crypto Task Force, which is leading the charge in establishing new, clear rules and processes for firms operating in the digital asset sector. With clear guidelines and guardrails in place, firms will have the confidence they need to take the next step and consider an IPO. Bridging the gap between traditional and digital finance The truth is, the shift is already underway. Major stablecoin issuer Circle has just filed for an IPO, with crypto exchange Kraken and coin issuer Ripple rumored to be following in their footsteps. Soon enough, we’ll see crypto companies, from major exchanges and issuers all the way through to mining firms, list. They have weathered the regulatory storm and are now looking to send clear compliance signals. As they embark on the next phase of institutional and mainstream adoption, they know they must prove to investors that they operate transparently and within the law. They need to prove that they are safe, long-term bets, and they’ll do it by floating on traditional stock markets. It is the natural next step in bridging the gap between the traditional finance sector and its digital counterpart. Significant progress has been made over the last few years, and there’s no denying that the change of administration in November 2024 has sped up the process even further. Crypto firms find themselves in an incredibly positive regulatory environment, and I have no doubt they will strike now. For me, we’ll see record numbers of crypto firms filing for IPOs this year, and a record number of firms securing them, too. The IPO momentum is already in full swing. Before you know it, we’ll see the brightest and the best crypto firms take their rightful place on the biggest stock markets across the globe.

After years of hype around a potential $10 price, legal battles and new competitors loom. Ripple’s long-running SEC lawsuit has been paused for settlement talks, leaving XRP in limbo through much of 2025. At the same time, central banks are exploring their digital currencies, and faster blockchains like Stellar (XLM) or Algorand (ALGO) are nibbling at XRP’s core use case. XRP at a crossroads: regulation and rivalry XRP’s recent price surge was driven by hopes of a court victory and the introduction of new ETFs, but the path ahead remains unclear. So far, a court has only approved a temporary pause in the SEC vs. Ripple appeals​ , and any final settlement could still be months away. New SEC Chair Paul Atkins has hinted that he’ll quickly resolve crypto cases , but until then, XRP remains caught in legal uncertainty. Meanwhile, the cross-border payments market is getting crowded. In short, even if XRP avoids fines, other blockchains and financial technologies could limit its growth. Rexas Finance (RXS): a new contender In this climate, Rexas Finance (RXS) has emerged as a promising alternative. It’s an Ethereum-based project designed for the tokenization of the tangible world, encompassing assets (RWAs), including everything from real estate and art to commodities and intellectual property. This means that ordinary investors can own fractional shares of high-value items. For example, Rexas Finance’s tools allow thousands to purchase fractional shares of a $10 million building or fine artwork. Its platform, with features like the Rexas Token Builder and Launchpad, makes creating and trading asset-backed tokens easy. RXS is bringing tangible investments onto the blockchain for the first time. RXS presale surges, eyes on 100× returns RXS’s presale numbers are eye-popping. Launched at just $0.03 in September 2024, the price has now increased to $0.20—roughly a six-fold increase in a few months. Approximately 458 million RXS (approximately 92% of the presale supply) have been sold, raising nearly $47–$48 million toward the $56 million hard cap. With that momentum, a confirmed launch price of $0.25 on June 19, 2025, means early buyers will see instant gains. Analysts are taking notice. One forecast expects RXS to reach approximately $5 by late 2025, a 25-fold increase, and $20+ by 2026, a 100-fold increase, if tokenization takes off. (By comparison, Ethereum went from cents to thousands in its boom.) Some models even mention prices near $25.97, which would imply roughly a 129x return from today’s price. These targets highlight the potential of RXS, as it is still in the early stages of a vast market. Why RXS might outpace XRP Compared to Ripple, RXS brings very different advantages: Massive growth potential: RXS remains relatively small, providing significant room for growth. One whale reportedly purchased 500,000 RXS (approximately $100,000) in a single order—a bet that’s fuelling a fear of missing out. In general, less capital is needed to lift RXS’s price than to move an already mature asset like XRP. Security and trust: RXS’s full CertiK audit and listings on CoinMarketCap and Coingecko reduce the risk of scams. Many new coins lack an audit or an exchange presence, but RXS proactively addresses these issues. Taken together, these factors make RXS an attractive hedge for XRP investors. XRP’s growth depends on achieving legal clarity and gaining bank adoption, both of which are slow-moving processes. RXS, by contrast, is already live and solving a practical problem—it can simply climb by winning market share in asset tokenization. Conclusion: act before the presale ends XRP may eventually rebound, but its upside in 2025 appears limited by ongoing court cases and increasing competition. For investors seeking higher returns, Rexas Finance offers a compelling investment opportunity. Its real-asset blockchain platform is gaining momentum, and Stage 12 is already around 92.51% full. To explore RXS, visit the Rexas Finance website now and join the final presale stage at $0.20. You can also enter the official Rexas Finance Giveaway (20 winners of $50,000 each) to earn bonus entries . Don’t wait for the price to jump to $0.25 on launch day—get in while you can. Ultimately, the choice is yours: stick with XRP only or diversify into a new token. Regardless of what happens to XRP by 2025, RXS is building strong fundamentals and community support in parallel. Early investors could look back and thank themselves for participating before the presale closed.

The meme coin is battling strong headwinds and bullish optimism as it fights to either climb higher or lose ground. With DOGE currently sitting at #8, market watchers are discussing where it could finish this year: a sit at the top 5 or a fall out of the top 10? Dogecoin: current momentum and challenges Dogecoin is holding steady at the $0.179 zone after a volatile start to 2025, during which its price declined by over 60%. In the last week alone, DOGE has gained nearly 12%, bouncing off support levels around $0.17. On the technical front, the 50-day EMA has been retaken, and analysts anticipate a path toward $0.20, followed by $0.28 if momentum is sustained. Dogecoin Price Chart (Weekly), Apr. 29, 2025 | Source: CoinGecko Although Dogecoin typically recovers quickly from low zones, including $0.15, historical trends indicate that the surges are fleeting. A sobering reminder of DOGE’s speculative character, it fell by more than 60% following a peak near $0.48 late last year. Investor excitement has flared up again, thanks to the broader strength of Bitcoin and chatter about the potential approval of a spot Dogecoin ETF . Still, trading remains tightly capped under $0.20 resistance, with bulls needing serious momentum to unlock higher ranges. Top 5 or outside 10th Place: Where does DOGE finish in 2025? For Dogecoin to even sniff the top 5 ranking, its market cap needs to almost quadruple, reaching around $100 billion. At the current token circulation, DOGE will need to trade at a price near $0.66. Breaking psychological levels at $0.2 and $0.35 would be just the beginning of that journey. On the other hand, if momentum fades, Dogecoin risks slipping out of the top 10 altogether. Tron, currently ranked #10 with a $23.6 billion market cap, is closely following, and newer utility tokens with stronger narratives are rapidly emerging. In an unbiased view, Dogecoin’s best case is a modest climb closer to $0.30-$0.40 by the end of the year, but a top 5 finish looks extremely unlikely without a massive meme-driven rally. The risk of sliding out of the top 10 remains real if broader market sentiment sours. Meanwhile, investors seeking more than speculative hype are already turning their attention to utility-driven newcomers, and topping the list? Rexas Finance (RXS) , a project setting up to mint a new wave of crypto millionaires before the year’s end. Rexas Finance (RXS): the RWA revolution investors can’t ignore Rexas Finance appears poised to revolutionize the entire real-world asset (RWA) sector. Built to inject flexibility and accessibility into a traditionally reserved investment space, this user-oriented project makes tokenizing assets, such as real estate, art, and commodities, seamless for everyday investors. Picture this: Instead of needing $500,000 to buy property, Rexas Finance allows users to invest as little as $50 in fractionalized, blockchain-secured real estate tokens. The old barriers, including high capital requirements, paperwork, and elite networks, have been shattered. This new investment model is already grabbing headlines. The response has been swift and decisive. Despite still being in presale, Rexas Finance now boasts over 50,000 active holders , a stunning achievement for a token that hasn’t even officially launched. Investors are recognizing the power of combining asset security with blockchain liquidity. Ongoing RXS presale: a record in the making The RXS presale is currently in its final stage, with 92% of tokens already sold. From a humble start at $0.03 to today’s $0.20, RXS has delivered a 566% presale gain and raised $48.5 million so far. With no venture capital backing, Rexas Finance made the strategic decision to forgo venture capital. Investors don’t need to fear massive early token unlocks that could crush prices post-launch. Early listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko also fueled confidence, providing transparency and visibility from the outset of its life cycle. Upcoming official RXS listing: set for blastoff Mark the date: June 19, 2025. That’s when RXS officially lists on at least three tier-1 exchanges, exchanges known for generating enormous liquidity and exposure. Listing at $0.25, RXS offers a built-in 733% premium for first presale buyers, and analysts forecast a possible 100,000% rally before year-end. Such a surge would catapult Rexas Finance into the elite top 10 crypto rankings, firmly securing it as the dominant force in the booming RWA tokenization market. What’s fueling this outlook? It’s not just hype. It’s a $1 quadrillion+ addressable market, combined with access to mega-exchanges and investor-ready utility. Solana or Rexas Finance: 2025 will pick winners, and RXS looks ready Dogecoin’s battle for relevance continues, but its path to the top 5 is steep and uncertain. Meanwhile, true disruptors like Rexas Finance are rising with powerful momentum behind them. With the presale almost entirely sold out and the exchange listing countdown on, this may be the final chance to join RXS before it explodes into the spotlight. Don’t miss the next big winner before it’s out of reach.

The woman’s partner fought back, grabbing one of the guns and threw it away. Her screams caught the attention of nearby pedestrians and the kidnappers fled from the place. The victims suffered minor injuries. The Rising Crypto Related Crimes Unfortunately, this is one of the many incidents this year.

The French interior minister Bruno Retailleau, announced on Wednesday that he would hold a meeting with crypto professionals to discuss how to prevent future kidnappings after such several such high-profile cases in France. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The results show a two-point increase from a similar survey run between April 25 and 27, where Trump sat at 42%. The same poll puts his approval on economic matters at 39%, compared to 36% last round. Trump started his presidency back in January 2021 with 47% support. That number slid over the years, largely because of nonstop fights with global trade partners. Americans didn’t take kindly to the back-and-forth of tariffs , especially with China, which hit stock prices and got economists yelling “recession” from every corner. But now, with Trump easing off some of the heat—including cutting down those sky-high tariffs on Monday morning—there’s a bit of relief. Markets have noticed. The S&P 500 index is up 17% from its lowest point during Trump’s second time in office. That low came shortly after he rolled out fresh tariffs. Now that some of those are being pulled back, investors seem to be breathing again. Americans are still stressed about the economy Even though things are looking slightly less chaotic, nobody’s exactly throwing a party. The poll shows 69% of Americans still think a recession is possible. That’s lower than the 76% who felt that way back in mid-April, but still high. Fear over the stock market also dipped—from 67% to 60%—but again, that doesn’t mean confidence has returned. It just means the panic has simmered down a bit. Trump’s go-to argument lately is that Joe Biden should be blamed for the mess. He keeps pointing fingers at Biden’s handling of the COVID-19-era economy, when inflation ran wild. While prices did cool toward the end of Biden’s presidency, the damage was done. The latest Labor Department figures show inflation in April wasn’t as bad as expected. That gave Trump a bit of an opening, but economists still say his trade policies could hike prices again later this year. The poll didn’t let Trump off the hook. 59% said that if a recession actually hits this year, it would be his fault. Just 37% said Biden would deserve the blame. So while his approval is improving, the public is still ready to hold him responsible if things go south. Stagflation warnings hit, but data stays mild The Federal Reserve, after its May 7 meeting, warned that the country faces a real risk of stagflation—slowing growth plus rising prices—because of Trump’s aggressive tariff policies, which went into effect starting April 2. That warning came fast, just weeks after the new trade moves dropped. But so far, the numbers haven’t backed up the worst-case scenario. The inflation data out Tuesday shows prices have not surged—at least not yet. Even the core inflation number, which leaves out food and gas, was lower than many analysts thought it would be. That doesn’t mean everything’s fine, though. The data only covers a short time after the new tariffs started, and some businesses are still eating the cost instead of passing it to customers. There was also a wave of imported goods early in the year, which helped slow down prices but also dragged GDP growth into negative territory for the first quarter. Trump’s team paused the so-called “reciprocal” tariffs, signed a temporary deal with China, and closed a new trade agreement with the UK meant to cool off the threat of rising prices and keep consumer spending, which drives the US economy, from collapsing.

Markets held their breath as each headline hinted at escalating tariffs, diplomatic jabs, and mounting uncertainty. But just as it seemed both sides had finally shaken hands on a long-anticipated trade agreement, President Donald Trump’s post has stirred the pot yet again. “We’re leading China in crypto”. Is the timing a coincidence? You decide. US, China, and Weaponizing Crypto This isn’t new. While the headlines scream about tariffs and trade deals, the real power struggle between the U.S. and China is playing out on a very different front – Bitcoin. Behind the noise, both nations have been quietly building their reserves, not to profit, but to prepare. This is no longer a bet on crypto markets, but a hedge against the collapse of the global financial order. The U.S. government currently holds over 198,000 BTC. China isn’t far behind at around 190,000 BTC. But how they got there – and what they’re doing with it – reveals two very different strategies. China’s focus has been on infrastructure. Even after cracking down on miners, Chinese firms still dominate ASIC hardware production, mining pool software, and backend infrastructure that powers much of Bitcoin’s network. Their approach is to quietly shape the system from within. Influence the rules. Control the rails. The U.S., on the other hand, plays defense with offense. Most of its BTC wasn’t purchased – it was seized. From Silk Road busts to major hack recoveries, these coins are now being held like digital gold reserves. Quiet, calculated, and likely off-market. Crypto Cheers as U.S.-China Trade Truce Sparks Market Optimism But look what happens when everyone plays nice! After months of tension, the U.S. and China agreed to dial things down. Tariffs on both sides are being slashed – the U.S. from 145% to 30%, and China from 125% to 10%. And the crypto market noticed. Bitcoin flew past $104,000, Ethereum bounced back above $2,500, and even Dogecoin rallied. The sentiment shift was instant. Why? Because smoother trade means lower inflation risk – and that could push the Fed to ease up on rates. When interest rates drop, money looks for growth and crypto is still one of the boldest bets out there. The U.S. and China also agreed to keep the conversation going. That stability, even if temporary, is good news for risk assets.",News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-14 11:38:04

The excitement comes from the scheduled appearance of co-founder Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis, who is expected to announce important updates about Pi’s ecosystem . Speculations are running high about announcements related to the launch of new DApps , long-awaited listing on exchange platforms like BitMart, HTX, or even Binance, and potentially a detailed roadmap for Pi’s mainnet launch. Consequently, the hunt for Pi coin price analysis is growing louder. Pi Coin Price Analysis: Is the $2 Mark Next? Pi price has impressed the crypto space with a 103.12% gain over the past week, rising from under $0.70 to a high of $1.34. In the past 24 hours alone, the altcoin spiked 5.89%, to a high of $1.34 before retracing to current levels around $1.17. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Pi Network Price Prediction: Can 265 Million Token Unlocks Impact a Possible 234% Rally? , The 4-hour chart shows a sharp breakout rally that spiked at a key resistance level of $1.40. Despite failing to breach this resistance, the price has found support around $1.09–$1.10. The 9-D Simple Moving Average , currently at $1.1678, has been acting as dynamic support. Based on the current trends, the potential low for PI could rest around $1.05 if selling pressure increases. The average trading range is between $1.15 and $1.25. If the bullish momentum resumes, especially catalysed by positive news from the Consensus Summit, the price is likely to retest $1.40 and could push toward the $2 mark . .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Many use fake reviews, incorrect contact information and unrealistic promises to lure you in. The best approach is a healthy dose of skepticism. Watching for these red flags will keep you safe while investing. The burgeoning cryptocurrency market, with its lack of centralized authority and a constant flow of inexperienced users, makes digital assets a prime target for scammers. Fake crypto investment platforms are a common scam method , masquerading as useful services for crypto traders. Before signing up for any crypto investment platform , it’s essential to learn the telltale signs of a scam. This article will detail what to watch out for and how to verify if a crypto investment platform is legitimate. These tips will teach you how to avoid crypto scams. Did you know? The FTC hosts a crypto scam detection guide that allows you to view common crypto scams , sorted by company name, scam type and other keywords. How to spot a crypto scam Here are 10 crypto investment scam red flags to watch for when choosing a cryptocurrency investment platform. 1. Promising unrealistic returns What to watch for: Fake crypto investment platforms will try to entice you with unrealistic promises, like “Make 1 Bitcoin in just a few days!” A legitimate crypto exchange won’t need to sell you with fake deals. How to verify: The platform’s services should speak for themselves. None of them will give you a special advantage over the other, especially not one that can net you a Bitcoin just days after signing up. This is one of those prime crypto scam warning signs. 2. Fake team members What to watch for: It’s easy to make an “our team” page on any website, let alone one offering a decentralized service. At a minimum, these pages should include photos, descriptions and links to LinkedIn or other verified social media platforms. How to verify: Double-check team pages for legitimacy. Some scammers might also set up fake social media pages, so scan those for authentic interactions and delve deep into each team member’s project history. 3. Inconsistent white paper What to watch for: Let’s be honest, most scammers won’t expect customers to read their project white paper. It’s probably something they threw together in ChatGPT or even plagiarized from a legitimate project. How to verify: Read a project’s white paper in-depth and watch for legitimate use cases. Make sure the project solves a real problem, has a legitimate purpose and a realistic plan for the future. Don’t fall for buzzwords! Did you know? Justin Sun, founder of Tron’s long-standing blockchain platform, has been accused of plagiarizing Ethereum’s white paper. 4. False endorsements What to watch for: Just as it’s super easy to fabricate an “our team” page, scammers can place fake endorsements all over their home page. It’s as quick as copying and pasting a company logo like Forbes. How to verify: Instead of trusting an exchange’s webpage, look up news releases and other proof of these supposed endorsements. Cointelegraph provides a directory of legit exchanges to help you identify fake crypto websites. 5. Lack of regulatory information What to watch for: Now, regulatory requirements may vary depending on whether you’re looking at a centralized or decentralized platform, but if you’re looking at the former, know that centralized platforms cannot operate without regulatory approval from your government. How to verify: Typically, you can check a government database to confirm if a platform is licensed. If it’s not, it may not be trustworthy. For example, the CEO of Tether (USDT) refuses to comply with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework. The company is known for its resistance to comply with regulatory policies, causing industry-wide suspicion. 6. Pushy sales tactics What to watch for: Pushy sales tactics are a big red flag. If a platform reaches out to you through social media, such as through a direct message on X, Discord or Telegram, you can be sure it’s a scam. Scammers might claim to be an employee or crypto influencer ready to provide you with an “exclusive offer” or “limited time deal.” How to verify: A real exchange would never reach out to potential customers like this, especially via social media. Social media DMs are widespread crypto scam tactics. Did you know? Some top crypto scams in 2024 were phishing attacks, rug pulls and fake airdrops. 7. Fake location/contact info What to watch for: Crypto investment platforms with a real product, even decentralized ones, will have contact information. Even Uniswap has a support email with which to get in touch. Centralized entities should also have addresses of their offices, ones that you can cross-reference with Google Maps for legitimacy purposes. How to verify: If a crypto investment platform is missing any contact information, consider that a red flag. This is an easy sign to miss. 8. Fake reviews What to watch for: Tech products, blockchain-based and otherwise, feature user reviews front and center on their websites. That said, you can tell if these are real or manufactured. Keep an eye out for reviews with repetitive language and a lack of a critical eye, which only praise the platform. Glowing reviews are often fake, possibly even written by AI. How to verify: Search for platform reviews on Reddit and other social media sites. Other users will tell you if the platform is legit or not. If a platform has no social media accounts, there is more reason to avoid it. 9. Fake airdrops or giveaways What to watch for: Some fraudulent platforms may offer airdrops or giveaways as promotions to attract positive attention. However, participating in the fake airdrop might require inputting a wallet seed phrase or private key. How to verify: Legitimate airdrops will be announced on social media platforms like X, the platform’s blog on Medium or its official website. They’ll only ask for your wallet address, nothing more. 3. No fiat offramping What to watch for: A crypto exchange with no fiat offramping means it’s not registered with local financial institutions. The platform might demand that you only work in crypto. How to verify: If you sign up for an exchange and it immediately asks you to send crypto into your wallet on the platform instead of linking a payment method like a bank or card, this is a big red flag. Cryptocurrency investment scams thrive on urging you to make rash decisions. It’s always best to be skeptical when choosing where to trade, invest or hold your crypto. Take your time, do your research, and double-check every piece of information a platform provides. These crypto fraud prevention tips will help keep you safe, protecting your assets and peace of mind. Use them to create a crypto scam checklist.

However, this month’s drive back into six-figures amid cooling tariff tensions is presenting a number of warning signs that appear eerily similar to the 2021 cycle high. In 2021, bitcoin made an historic record high in April of $65,000, coinciding with a flurry of activity from Michael Saylor’s (then-named) MicroStrategy and the IPO of Coinbase (COIN). The excitement was capitalized on by shrewd traders, who shorted the big news and rode BTC down to an eventual bottom at $28,000 just two months later. Then, as the entire industry began preparing for a sustained bear market or even the end of bitcoin (remember the Chinese mining ban), BTC turned tail and began a rally that didn’t stop for four months. This relentless surge to the upside resulted in a new record high of $69,000, despite all on-chain metrics pointing towards a bearish outcome. Ominously, the current price action this time around is being accompanied by those same on-chain metrics telling a similar story about a potential double top. A deeper dive The first of those metrics is weekly RSI, which is exhibiting three strikes of bearish divergence from March 2024, December 2024 and May 2025. RSI is an indicator that compares averages gains with average losses over a set period to gauge potentially overbought or oversold conditions. Bearish divergence is where RSI is trending to the downside whilst price is trending to the upside. This, coupled with trading volumes that are lower compared to the initial move above $100K, suggests that the momentum of this swing higher is dwindling. Volumes are down across both crypto and institutional venues, with volume on CME BTC futures failing to surpass 35,000 contracts during three of the previous four weeks. The initial move saw volumes regularly exceed 65,000 contracts, hitting more than 85,000 on three occasions. One contract on the CME is worth 5 bitcoin ($514,000). Like in 2021, open interest is also diverging from price action, currently Open interest 13% lower than the initial drive to $109K in January while price is just 5.8% lower. Four years ago when bitcoin hit $69,000, open interest was 15.6% lower than the initial $65,000 high despite the price being 6.6% higher. What does this mean? The similarities with 2021 are clear but it’s worth noting that the crypto market structure is entirely different than four years ago. Mostly thanks to Michael Saylor's Strategy and a growing number of corporate copycats ramping up BTC acquisitions at any cost, the presence of institutional interest is far higher in this cycle. There is also the element of spot bitcoin ETFs, which allows intuitional investors and companies to acquire BTC in a traditional regulated venue. As learned in 2021, on-chain metrics can be an inaccurate measure of forecasting price action. It is feasible that BTC breaks a new record high after Trump inevitably reveals details of a U.S. bitcoin treasury, but that could also become a “sell the news event,” in which traders attempt to capitalize on emotional buying from uninformed retail investors. What the indicators do suggest is that whilst a new record high could be formed like in 2021, the momentum of this move is waning and analysts who are boldly calling for $150K or even $200K price targets could be in for a rude awakening once the sell-off truly begins. Bitcoin entered more than a one-year bear market at the end of 2021, resulting in substantial layoffs across the industry and the implosion of several trading firms , centralized lending companies and DeFi protocols. This time around, the market has several other elements to consider if prices begin to tumble. Notably, MSTR’s leveraged BTC position, the emerging BTC DeFi industry that has $6.3 billon in total value locked (TVL), and the billions of frothy dollars that bounce around the memecoin ecosystem, which is known to disproportionately contract during times of market pressure",Markets|Bitcoin|btc|Bear market|Technical Analysis|market analysis|News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-14 11:40:28

The two companies aim to expand services for institutional clients with crypto liquidity and banking services. The crypto prime broker, will partner with the Standard Chartered banking group. The combined efforts of the companies will go toward securing services and liquidity for institutional investors. In the first phase of the partnership, Standard Chartered will expand access to banking services for FalconX clients. Standard Chartered will offer banking infrastructure Access to the Standard Chartered banking infrastructure will allow FalconX to tap multiple fiat currency pairs for faster, more reliable cross-border settlements. This will allow the crypto prime broker to have a high-grade off-ramp for large-scale institutional clients. Secure banking services have been one of the key bottlenecks for crypto companies, due to regulations or overall skepticism of crypto assets. “At FalconX, we support trading and financing for some of the world’s largest institutions in digital asset markets, and this relationship strengthens our ability to deliver robust banking and FX solutions to clients who rely on us to operate in crypto markets,” said Matt Long, General Manager for APAC and the Middle East at FalconX. The partnership tracks the recent trend of combining traditional finance with crypto purchases. Institutions have shown interest in both purchasing and actively using crypto. The firm’s portfolio of services targets payment solution companies, asset managers, hedge funds, as well as native token issuers. FalconX reports a total of 600 institutional clients, offering more involved banking as the crypto market heats up once again. FalconX gets a head start in bridging crypto and traditional finance Having a reliable banking operation as a fiat off-ramp is key to quality crypto services. The ability to partner with an international bank also showcases the increased trust in crypto activity, while previously, crypto companies had limited success finding banks or faced outright hostility and exclusion . FalconX on its side aims to offer reliable trading, custody, as well as lending liquidity to all participating institutions. In this case, crypto firms also have a head start in bridging traditional finance and crypto. Banks have been reluctant to offer crypto services, so native companies have equipped themselves with banking options. The company’s subsidiary, FalconX Bravo, Inc., was the first CFTC-registered dealer focused on cryptocurrency derivative trading. It also hinted at seeking acquisitions to expand its available services. In its crypto activity, FalconX remains a small-scale investor in decentralized projects. So far, the platform has participated in 10 funding rounds, with a loss of over 83% due to bear market conditions. FalconX participated in 10 funding rounds as a small-scale investment company, while still sitting on significant reserves from its own fundraising. | Source: Cryptorank The 2024 bull market translated into increased revenues for FalconX, up 2.5 times compared to the same period of 2023. It reports over $1.5T in trading volumes from its inception until 2023, still processing subsequent trading. FalconX was successful in its own fundraising, with $427M acquired in multiple VC-backed rounds. It received its seed round in 2020 and had to survive a prolonged bear market while building up its services. Based on its financing, the firm is valued at $8B.

In a new interview with CNBC, Lee argues that US businesses have demonstrated resiliency in the face of the pandemic, rate hikes and now tariffs. “Right now, the 10-Year yield at 4% I think isn’t a huge burden, not only for the government, but also for the economy or for companies, so I think it’s a level of funding that businesses can earn a return on capital, and then as we think about 2026, there’s a lot to be excited about, we have deregulation coming, we have the tariff debacle behind us, we have tax cuts possibly, and then we might have better trade partnerships with other countries, meaning US companies have earnings upside. I think that the market is flat year-to-date through May, so I don’t think anyone should feel like they missed anything. I think that they’re going to have a chance to buy a lot of companies – a lot of stocks got obliterated, and I think that these washed-out names are still opportunities. We talk about it with our clients, whether it’s Tesla, or the MAG-7 (Magnificent 7), or the small-caps, there are many opportunities still.” The Magnificent Seven stocks include shares of the tech giants Tesla, Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia.

These updates mark significant steps toward the highly anticipated $WHALE Token Generation Event (TGE), offering players unprecedented opportunities to stack tokens, double their holdings, and prepare for the token’s upcoming launch. With a thriving community and a commitment to accessibility, Whale.io is setting the stage for a fair launch and game-changing moment in crypto gaming. “Wager & Earn”: Stack $WHALE Tokens with Every Bet The “Wager & Earn” campaign is Whale.io’s latest innovation, designed to reward players for doing what they love—playing. The premise is simple yet powerful: every bet placed on Whale.io earns players XP, and each XP translates directly into one $WHALE token added to their balance in real time. Whether spinning slots, betting on live casino games, or wagering on sports, every action counts toward building a $WHALE stack before the token officially hits the blockchain. “$WHALE is coming, and early stackers eat first!” says the Whale.io team. “Let’s make it easy for you: every single bet you place earns you XP. And every XP? One $WHALE token in your balance. In real time. Play anything you like: slots, live casino, sports, it all counts. Watch your XP climb and your $WHALE stack grow before the token even hits the chain. Then? Use those tokens to unlock utility, staking perks, merch access, and real crypto value when the chain goes live. This is how you front-run the drop. Play now. Build the bag. Rule the launch.” The current campaign encourages players to increase their $WHALE token holdings in advance of the upcoming token generation event (TGE). Upon launch, token holders are expected to gain access to a range of platform-specific benefits. These include staking functionalities, in-game utilities, access to limited merchandise, project updates, and additional utility within the Whale.io ecosystem. By linking token accrual to gameplay activities, Whale.io aims to integrate community participation into the broader token framework, thereby reinforcing engagement through functional incentives within the platform’s ecosystem. Extended $WHALE Token Conversion from Wheel of Whales In another major update, users can now bring their $WHALE tokens from Wheel of Whales to Whale.io. The conversion window is open for only 14 days, so all token holders need to be quick not to lose their hard earned tokens. This two weeks ensures that every player has the chance to bring their Wheel of Whales earnings—generated through spins or missions—into the Whale.io ecosystem, aligning their holdings with the platform’s upcoming TGE. The conversion process is a critical step toward the $WHALE token’s launch, consolidating tokens from Wheel of Whales, a play-to-earn game with 6 millions of players and billions of tokens generated, into Whale.io’s unified platform. To sweeten the deal, Whale.io is introducing an exciting “Double or Nothing” feature for converted tokens. Players who transfer their $WHALE tokens from Wheel of Whales to Whale.io can opt to play a coin flip game, wagering all or a portion of their tokens for a chance to double their holdings. This high-stakes opportunity adds an extra layer of thrill, allowing players to go big and potentially amplify their $WHALE stack. “The race has begun—convert your tokens from #WoW to Whale!” the Whale.io team announced. “Play Double or Nothing—go BIG and DOUBLE YOUR $WHALE! Keep earning and converting in #WoW. Every token counts.” This campaign underscores Whale.io’s commitment to making the TGE accessible and rewarding, ensuring that every player has a chance to participate in the token’s future. A Step Closer to the $WHALE TGE These updates bring Whale.io closer to its $WHALE TGE, a landmark event that will introduce the token to the broader crypto market. Unlike traditional token launches, $WHALE is backed by a successful business with a large, engaged community of over 15 million players. The token’s utility is deeply integrated into Whale.io’s ecosystem, enabling staking, gameplay, and access to exclusive perks like exclusive merchandise and special events. Whale.io’s Buyback promise, which reinvests 10% of monthly casino revenue to buy back $WHALE tokens, further enhances the token’s value by reducing the circulating supply over time. By allowing users to convert tokens from Wheel of Whales to Whale platform and launching “Wager & Earn” campaign, Whale.io has launched another phase in their token launch roadmap and brings $WHALE into their entertainment hub ahead of the TGE. The “Double or Nothing” coin flip adds an element of excitement, rewarding bold players with the potential for exponential gains. These initiatives reflect Whale.io’s community-first approach, avoiding venture capital or private rounds to ensure that retail players and loyal users are the primary beneficiaries of the token’s success. Why $WHALE Stands Out The $WHALE token is poised for a successful launch thanks to its strong foundation and unique features: Thriving Business Backing: Whale.io’s crypto casino and sportsbook generates significant revenue, fueling the $WHALE token’s utility and value. The platform’s growth directly supports token demand. Real-Time Earning: The “Wager & Earn” campaign lets players accumulate $WHALE tokens through everyday gameplay, making it easy to collect tokens without leaving the platform ahead of the TGE. Community Focus: With no VC involvement, $WHALE is designed to reward retail players and the Whale community, fostering wealth-building opportunities. Utility and Innovation: From staking rewards to exclusive games in development, $WHALE will power a range of experiences on Whale.io Whale Casino Launches “Wager & Earn” Campaign Ahead of $WHALE TGE Whale.io has introduced the “Wager & Earn” campaign, enabling participants to convert Wheel of Whales tokens and engage with the “Double or Nothing” coin flip feature, which offers the potential to increase $WHALE holdings through in-platform gameplay. The platform has outlined additional updates and campaign developments across its social media channels, including details surrounding the upcoming token generation event (TGE). As the TGE approaches, Whale.io continues to provide utility-driven engagement options designed to integrate token-based interactions into its broader gaming and rewards ecosystem.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) exhibited a strong negative correlation with the US stock market when analyzing the short-term, seven-day trailing correlation, according to new research from blockchain data provider RedStone Oracles, shared exclusively with Cointelegraph. Bitcoin, S&P 500, 7-day rolling correlation. Source: Redstone Oracles However, RedStone said that the 30-day indicator signals a “variable correlation” between Bitcoin price and the S&P 500 index, with the correlation coefficient ranging from -0.2 to 0.4. This fluctuating correlation suggests that Bitcoin “doesn’t consistently function as a true hedge for equities” due to its lack of a strong negative correlation below -0.3, which is needed for “reliable counter movement during market stress,” the report said. Bitcoin, S&P 500, 30-day rolling correlation, 1-year chart. Source: Redstone Oracles Related: $1B Bitcoin exits Coinbase in a day as analysts warn of supply shock The research suggests that while Bitcoin may not be a dependable hedge against stock market declines, it offers value as a portfolio diversifier. This fluctuating dynamic signals that Bitcoin often moves independently from other assets, potentially offering additional returns while other assets are struggling. Still, Bitcoin has yet to mirror the safe-haven dynamics of gold and government bonds, RedStone suggests. Related: Nasdaq-listed GDC plans to buy Bitcoin and TRUMP memecoin for $300M Bitcoin needs to “mature” before decoupling from stock market While Bitcoin is poised to grow into a safe-haven asset in the future, the world’s first cryptocurrency still needs to “mature” as a global asset, according to Marcin Kazmierczak, co-founder and chief operating officer at RedStone. “Bitcoin still needs to mature before decoupling from stock markets,” Kazmierczak told Cointelegraph, adding: “Increased institutional adoption will absolutely help — we’re already seeing this effect with corporate treasury investments reducing Bitcoin’s 30-day volatility and with BlackRock repetitively praising BTC as an asset in a portfolio.” Meanwhile, Bitcoin will see growing recognition as a portfolio diversifier, with an annualized return of over 230% for the past five years, which “significantly outperformed” both stocks and traditional safe-haven assets, Kazmierczak said, adding that “even a small 1–5% Bitcoin allocation can meaningfully enhance a portfolio’s risk-adjusted returns.” Source: Vetle Lunde Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s declining volatility supports BTC’s growing maturity as a global financial asset. Bitcoin’s weekly volatility hit a 563-day low on April 30, a development that may signal more stable price action. Bitcoin’s price volatility fell below the realized volatility of the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100, signaling that investors are increasingly treating Bitcoin as a long-term investment vehicle, Cointelegraph reported on May 13.

The native asset of Ethereum has rocketed 44% over three days to $2,600. At the same time, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is creating a word, raising $8,200,000 through the sale of over 465 million tokens to 9,900 holders since presale began. In phase 4, this DeFi initiative costs $0.025 each and have reached 75% token issuance, and is designed to deliver immense returns to investors. Investors now have an impending deadline in the wake of phase 5 and a 20% hike to $0.03. These altcoins present a once in a while opportunity to take advantage of a bullish move, combining rates of historical growth with revolutionary use cases. Ethereum’s Parabolic Surge Ethereum evidences explosive growth as it emerges from its $1,400 bottom to enter an area renowned to spark rousing rallies. Since 2015, a parabolic price trajectory has dictated Ethereum’s performance with targets being set to reach $10,000. As RSI bounces back from a historic low, this bullish trend proves a powerful signal toward possible five figure achievement for ETH. The standing of Ethereum improves compared to other cryptocurrencies as Bitcoin capital outflows fuel more altcoin activity. An increasing wedge shape in the performance of Solana as compared to Ethereum is showing slackening momentum whereas XRP also experiences similar capital outflows. A symmetrical triangle consolidation can demonstrate that ETH might breakout which may reach $10,000 or even more than $20,000 based on various indicators in technical analysis. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Momentum With the lending model, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is carving a unique stand in DeFi where value-driven utility is favored over purely speculative activity. Mutuum Finance’s presale is in its ongoing Phase 4 with $0.025 token price being a large increase compared to the opening tier of $0.01. Current token purchase buyers will receive a 20% reward when the token price is $0.03 during phase 5. After the launch, analysts are bullish on hitting $3.50 that can mean 13,900% ROI. Profit that Mutuum Finance makes is utilized in purchasing MUTM tokens that are returned to stakers and in turn creates continued interest in purchasing. Lately, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) introduced a dashboard of the top 50 stakeholders who will receive bonus tokens for staying in their positions, which strengthens investor motivation. Security and Utility in Focus A smart contract audit with Certik has been initiated by Mutuum Finance (MUTM) in order to develop trust. After completion of the review process, the results will be published on social platforms for more trustworthiness. By means of mtETH along with other mtTokens, people will be able to earn passive income, depositing Ethereum and other assets, thus not losing the ability to use capital. The existence of overcollateralized loans, as well as stabilizes, transactions, and reduces risk exposure for both sides. Although Ethereum has many use cases, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) specializes in lending and through P2P transactions for specific assets, it has created a niche in a flooded market. Since phase 4 has nearly reached full capacity, it becomes more and more crucial to buy tokens — at the price of $0.025, a price uplift is anticipated. Sealing the Opportunity By late 2025, Ethereum and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are bound to dominate the Altcoins market for blooming investments. Paired with its market standing, Ethereum might deliver earnings of 5x-10x, while Mutuum Finance (MUTM) supported with a thought-out presale and DeFi application targets as high as 30x. Those investors interested in explosive gains must hurry during Phase 4’s low price of $0.025 since the next phase prices are $0.03.

These updates mark significant steps toward the highly anticipated WHALE Token Generation Event (TGE), offering players unprecedented opportunities to stack tokens, double their holdings, and prepare for the token’s upcoming launch. With a thriving community and a commitment to accessibility, Whale.io is setting the stage for a fair launch and game-changing moment in crypto gaming. “Wager & Earn”: Stack WHALE Tokens with Every Bet The “Wager & Earn” campaign is Whale.io’s latest innovation, designed to reward players for doing what they love—playing. The premise is simple yet powerful: every bet placed on Whale.io earns players XP, and each XP translates directly into one WHALE token added to their balance in real time. Whether spinning slots, betting on live casino games, or wagering on sports, every action counts toward building a WHALE stack before the token officially hits the blockchain. “WHALE is coming, and early stackers eat first!” says the Whale.io team. “Let’s make it easy for you: every single bet you place earns you XP. And every XP? One WHALE token in your balance. In real time. Play anything you like: slots, live casino, sports, it all counts. Watch your XP climb and your WHALE stack grow before the token even hits the chain. Then? Use those tokens to unlock utility, staking perks, merch access, and real crypto value when the chain goes live. This is how you front-run the drop. Play now. Build the bag. Rule the launch.” The current campaign encourages players to increase their WHALE token holdings in advance of the upcoming token generation event (TGE). Upon launch, token holders are expected to gain access to a range of platform-specific benefits. These include staking functionalities, in-game utilities, access to limited merchandise, project updates, and additional utility within the Whale.io ecosystem. By linking token accrual to gameplay activities, Whale.io aims to integrate community participation into the broader token framework, thereby reinforcing engagement through functional incentives within the platform’s ecosystem. Extended WHALE Token Conversion from Wheel of Whales In another major update, users can now bring their WHALE tokens from Wheel of Whales to Whale.io. The conversion window is open for only 14 days, so all token holders need to be quick not to lose their hard earned tokens. This two weeks ensures that every player has the chance to bring their Wheel of Whales earnings—generated through spins or missions—into the Whale.io ecosystem, aligning their holdings with the platform’s upcoming TGE. The conversion process is a critical step toward the WHALE token’s launch, consolidating tokens from Wheel of Whales, a play-to-earn game with 6 millions of players and billions of tokens generated, into Whale.io’s unified platform. To sweeten the deal, Whale.io is introducing an exciting “Double or Nothing” feature for converted tokens. Players who transfer their WHALE tokens from Wheel of Whales to Whale.io can opt to play a coin flip game, wagering all or a portion of their tokens for a chance to double their holdings. This high-stakes opportunity adds an extra layer of thrill, allowing players to go big and potentially amplify their WHALE stack. “The race has begun—convert your tokens from #WoW to Whale!” the Whale.io team announced. “Play Double or Nothing—go BIG and DOUBLE YOUR WHALE! Keep earning and converting in #WoW. Every token counts.” This campaign underscores Whale.io’s commitment to making the TGE accessible and rewarding, ensuring that every player has a chance to participate in the token’s future. A Step Closer to the WHALE TGE These updates bring Whale.io closer to its WHALE TGE, a landmark event that will introduce the token to the broader crypto market. Unlike traditional token launches, WHALE is backed by a successful business with a large, engaged community of over 15 million players. The token’s utility is deeply integrated into Whale.io’s ecosystem, enabling staking, gameplay, and access to exclusive perks like exclusive merchandise and special events. Whale.io’s Buyback promise, which reinvests 10% of monthly casino revenue to buy back WHALE tokens, further enhances the token’s value by reducing the circulating supply over time. By allowing users to convert tokens from Wheel of Whales to Whale platform and launching “Wager & Earn” campaign, Whale.io has launched another phase in their token launch roadmap and brings WHALE into their entertainment hub ahead of the TGE. The “Double or Nothing” coin flip adds an element of excitement, rewarding bold players with the potential for exponential gains. These initiatives reflect Whale.io’s community-first approach, avoiding venture capital or private rounds to ensure that retail players and loyal users are the primary beneficiaries of the token’s success. Why WHALE Stands Out The WHALE token is poised for a successful launch thanks to its strong foundation and unique features: Thriving Business Backing: Whale.io’s crypto casino and sportsbook generates significant revenue, fueling the WHALE token’s utility and value. The platform’s growth directly supports token demand. Real-Time Earning: The “Wager & Earn” campaign lets players accumulate WHALE tokens through everyday gameplay, making it easy to collect tokens without leaving the platform ahead of the TGE. Community Focus: With no VC involvement, WHALE is designed to reward retail players and the Whale community, fostering wealth-building opportunities. Utility and Innovation: From staking rewards to exclusive games in development, WHALE will power a range of experiences on Whale.io Whale Casino Launches “Wager & Earn” Campaign Ahead of WHALE TGE Whale.io has introduced the “Wager & Earn” campaign, enabling participants to convert Wheel of Whales tokens and engage with the “Double or Nothing” coin flip feature, which offers the potential to increase WHALE holdings through in-platform gameplay. The platform has outlined additional updates and campaign developments across its social media channels, including details surrounding the upcoming token generation event (TGE). As the TGE approaches, Whale.io continues to provide utility-driven engagement options designed to integrate token-based interactions into its broader gaming and rewards ecosystem.

Despite a challenging 2023, eToro saw 225% revenue growth in 2024, with a significant turnaround to $192 million in net income. At $50 per share, ETOR's IPO is oversubscribed, valuing the company at $4 billion, but it remains highly dependent on volatile crypto markets. While ETOR's growth is impressive, the stock is speculative due to its retail focus and market volatility, making it a short-term trade opportunity. After pausing plans for an IPO back in April following tariffs in the US, eToro Group Limited ( ETOR ) is going public and expected to begin trading on Wednesday May 14th. The company primarily operates a retail-focused investment platform that allows customers to trade just about anything from stocks, commodities, cryptocurrencies, and even fiat currencies all within one platform. In this article, we'll look at what eToro's consumer edge might be, the company's most recent reported financials, and whether I think ETOR is a buy given the strong investment demand for the oversubscribed IPO. What Makes eToro Different? There is certainly no shortage of ways for retail investors to get exposure to financial products in 2025. From a competitor standpoint, Robinhood ( HOOD ) is likely the closest thing to a head-to-head peer for ETOR. What, if any, edge does eToro have over a company like Coinbase ( COIN ) for crypto or a standard brokerage account with a legacy financial firm for buying traditional securities? Like Public.com, eToro offers a social element that investors won't find through more traditional investment platforms. From eToro's prospectus summary: eToro was founded in 2007 with the vision of a world where everyone can trade and invest in a simple and transparent way. We set out to change the retail investing experience by pioneering social investing . We have built a collaborative investment community designed to provide users with the educational resources and tools they need to grow their knowledge and wealth. Users can view other investors’ portfolios and statistics, and interact with them to exchange ideas and discuss strategies. The bold text above is my emphasis. In a way, eToro is a bit like a blend between Coinbase and Stocktwits - which, frankly, is a little dangerous, in my view. There is certainly something to be said about sharing ideas with other investors; this very platform - Seeking Alpha - is a fine example of that in practice. But having the ability to blindly copy the trades of other market participants can certainly add an element of risk to the company. Any time someone's wallet is involved, it can potentially lead to conflict and I think by allowing investors to copy and engage with each other within the app, eToro potentially runs the risk of long term client churn. For instance, a user who comes to eToro with little to no trading experience may find that copy trading strangers is a great way to lose money quickly and be soured on the experience. But that is admittedly a guess on my part. What matters more is the company's real numbers. eToro Financials At the end of 2024, eToro operated in 75 different countries and claimed 3.5 million funded accounts. After an abysmal 2023 that saw full year revenue fall by 38.7% from 2022, 2024 was terrific with 225% year over year growth: Revenue in 000s 2024 2023 2022 Net trading income from equities, commodities and currencies $328,706 $305,850 $393,480 Revenue from cryptoassets $12,147,329 $3,431,274 $5,595,977 Other (interest, currency conversion, trading derivatives) $164,518 $148,494 $344,332 Total revenue and income $12,640,553 $3,885,618 $6,333,789 Percent of Revenue from Crypto 96.10% 88.31% 88.35% Source: eToro prospectus I have two major takeaways from eToro's revenue breakout. First, at 96.1% of total revenue, eToro is highly dependent on cryptocurrencies and digital assets for top line growth. This is perhaps why the company recently announced 29 new tokens listed on the platform; 17 of which are deemed 'experimental' assets. My second takeaway is non-crypto revenue in 2024 - though up year over year - actually failed to eclipse the level from 2022. Taking each of these points together I draw the same conclusion. ETOR is essentially a crypto 'pure play' bet at this point. Costs and Net income in 000s 2024 2023 2022 Cost of revenue from cryptoassets $11,816,192 $3,303,910 $5,738,498 Margin interest expense $36,660 $25,280 $8,850 R&D $131,071 $128,950 $153,582 SG&A $406,369 $395,857 $627,543 Finance and other expense, net $4,642 $3,889 $20,181 Total costs $12,394,934 $3,857,886 $6,548,654 Income (loss) before taxes on income $245,619 $27,732 -$214,865 Taxes on income $53,238 $12,473 $117 Net income (loss) $192,381 $15,259 -$214,982 Source: eToro prospectus Even through what was a down revenue year in 2023, the company has done a nice job flipping from a $215 million net loss in 2022 to $192 million in net income in 2024. This has no doubt been aided by a dramatically different gross margin from eToro's crypto business: Figures in 000s 2024 2023 2022 Revenue from cryptoassets $12,147,329 $3,431,274 $5,595,977 Cost of revenue from cryptoassets $11,816,192 $3,303,910 $5,738,498 Gross Margin From Crypto 2.73% 3.71% -2.55% Source: eToro prospectus In 2022, eToro's gross margin from crypto was negative. In 2024, not only was the gross margin from crypto positive; but at 2.7%, eToro's gross margin is roughly double what Coinbase takes on consumer transaction volume. If eToro can continue earning this much from retail buyers trading digital assets, there's a strong case to be made for going long the stock. An additional consideration is the balance sheet health of the business: Balance Sheet in 000s as of 12/31/24 Cash and cash equivalents $575,395 Short-term investment $65,000 Cryptoassets $113,279 Total assets $1,191,362 Total liabilities $358,987 Total equity $832,375 Source: eToro prospectus At $575 million in cash and equivalents, the company has enough liquidity to cover liabilities even before raising capital through the IPO. What Is The Right Price For ETOR? 10 million shares at $50 per share would put a market valuation of $4 billion on the company. And again, this is apparently a significantly oversubscribed offering. But even at $50 per share, ETOR would be priced at nearly 5x book value and 4x the sector median for the multiple. That said, 5x book for ETOR would still put the company's price to book valuation beneath that of both HOOD and COIN at 7x and 6x respectively: Data by YCharts At a $4 billion valuation, ETOR would also be priced at just under 21 times trailing earnings. Data by YCharts Again, this is well ahead of the financial sector median but below both HOOD and COIN. And neither of those companies exhibited the revenue growth that eToro produced in 2024. So as a base case, if we priced ETOR based on a 7x price to book multiple, it would put the company at a roughly $5.8 billion valuation and $73 stock price assuming 10 million shares at IPO. At a 35 P/E ratio and 10 million IPO shares, ETOR trades at closer to $84 per share. And this would just put ETOR in line with HOOD from a valuation standpoint - a company that hasn't grown the top line nearly as fast as eToro in the last year. Closing Thoughts While some of these share prices I just threw out based on peer valuation multiples might make buying the ETOR IPO look like a slam dunk, please keep in mind how volatile the cryptocurrency business is. I suspect that ETOR is going to be a highly volatile stock, particularly during its first few sessions. And while this might be an exciting opportunity to buy stock in a growing global business in an exciting industry, there are serious risks to consider. First, eToro is a very retail-focused platform. The US equity market is fun when gains are easy and retail traders pile into the market. But from a market direction standpoint, 2025 is very uncertain in my view and the recent rally from April lows could be little more than an aggressive dead-cat bounce. We've seen how volatile eToro's top line has been over these last three years and the reliance on digital assets for top and bottom line performance figures to continue given the consumer cohort that eToro appeals to. While I may participate in ETOR from a short term trade standpoint, I don't plan to hold a large position for an extended period of time. That said, I'm calling ETOR a speculative 'buy' prior to IPO pricing .",ETOR,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-05-14 12:00:00

Bitwise CIO urges – Go beyond Bitcoin!,https://ambcrypto.com/missed-ethereums-37-rally-bitwise-cio-urges-go-beyond-bitcoin/,"Bitwise CIO implored crypto investors to go beyond Bitcoin. Some crypto indices outperformed BTC over the past five trading days. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan has championed a diversified crypto portfolio after last week’s Ethereum [ETH] 37% pump sidelined many investors. ETH dropped 60% in the past four months amid heightened FUD and overall headwinds linked to the U.S.-China tariff war. This pushed some investors to Bitcoin and other altcoins like Solana [SOL] and Ripple [XRP] . As a result, last week’s ETH pump may have caught many by surprise. Go beyond BTC, says Hougan To capitalize on such an opportunity, Hougan urged investors to go beyond BTC. “Bitcoin is the king of crypto assets—the largest, most liquid, and most established. And yet I think most investors should own other crypto assets.” He referenced the early internet boom in 2004, where Google dominated the search market. But the internet was the general purpose layer (tech) supporting several verticals and segments like social media, retail, video, B2B software etc. In fact, as of 2025, Google did well, but other leaders in key verticals like Netflix performed exceptionally well, something that wasn’t obvious in 2004, added Hougan. Source: Bitwise Hougan believed that a similar scenario could play out for blockchains, which he equated to general-purpose tech like the internet. “You can use a blockchain to create a better form of money (Bitcoin) or to create a programmable network for transferring “real-world assets” (Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche).” He added that each network may offer different returns over time. “If, for instance, you’re intrigued by the idea of nearly all the world’s assets moving onchain—history suggests you’d want to own a basket of crypto assets: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Chainlink, and more.” Source: Bitwise The diversified crypto portfolio is the idea behind crypto index ETFs. In fact, from a traditional perspective, Hougan noted that individual equity funds have lagged behind indices. “Over the past 20 years, actively managed U.S. equity funds have underperformed their benchmark indexes 97% of the time.” Interestingly, Google Finance data, on the lower 5-day timeframe, supported his thesis. Source: Google Finance (Performance as of 14th May, 6:54 UTC) Compared to other crypto indices like Bitwise Crypto 10, Hashdex Crypto Index and S&P Crypto MegaCap Futures, BTC rallied less than 1%. But the crypto indices and ETH surged 13% over the same period. Simply put, BTC investors could have gained an extra 13% or more if they were diversified to other crypto assets via ETFs or directly.",Altcoin|Bitcoin|News|News 1|Social|Trading View|ambcrypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'AMB Crypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/ambcrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",ambcrypto,2025-05-14 12:00:20

In a post that accompanied the chart shown below, the strategist quipped, “While you were busy being all excited about COIN being added to ES, XRP decided to breakout.” XRP Breakout Confirmed The annotated Bitstamp daily shows price clawing back to $2.5717, a 21% gain over the last seven sessions that decisively lifts the token through a six-month neckline sitting fractionally above $2.40. That horizontal barrier—coloured red on the chart—coincides with the top of a thin, downward-slanted Ichimoku cloud. Thursday’s close placed the candle not only above the Kumo but also above the 50-day EMA (orange), the 100-day EMA (aqua) and the 200-day SMA (dark blue), stacking the moving-average ribbon in a classic bullish configuration. The thrust completes an inverted head-and-shoulders that formed inside wave (iv) of a larger five-wave advance. The April swing low almost tagged the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement of the entire November-to-February impulse at $1.56732; wave “c” of that corrective leg created the pattern’s head, with symmetric shoulders in mid-March and early-May. Measured-move arithmetic from the formation’s $0.80 depth projects approximately $3.58—Big Mike boxes the target at $3.57638, exactly where the white arrow terminates on his chart and where the dashed vertical line identifies Wednesday, 18 June 2025 as a plausible time window. Related Reading: XRP Target Could Be $15 If This Pattern Is In Play, Analyst Says Market-profile data on the right flank strengthen the case: the heaviest volume node (green and tan bars) sits between $2.30 and $2.50, meaning the breakout thrust has already cleared the zone of greatest historical order flow. Above $2.80 the profile thins dramatically, implying scant overhead supply until the prior cycle’s upper channel rail near $3.00 and, ultimately, the $3.57 objective. Momentum gauges back the move. Daily RSI has reclaimed the 60-line and is rising briskly without yet entering overbought territory, while the stochastic oscillator has punched through its signal line and is accelerating toward the upper band—confirmation that impulse rather than mere short covering is at work. Related Reading: XRP Chart Hits Critical Level That ‘Opens The Sky,’ Analyst Warns Key risk markers remain below. Dashed support at $1.66027—the lower edge of the December–May broadening wedge—remains key; a failure to hold that level would invalidate the breakout thesis. Until then, the chart now offers bullish traders a classic post-neckline retest scenario, with the analyst eyeing $3.57 as the technical terminus of wave (v). For now, XRP bulls finally have a structure that justifies optimism—and, as Big Mike notes, they did it while the rest of the market was distracted by the inclusion of Coinbase (COIN) in the S&P 500 on Tuesday. At press time, XRP traded at $2.60.

On the other hand, gold prices have declined against the backdrop of a cooling investment spree, buoyed by the improving China-US trade relationship. In the crypto market, Bitcoin’s Fear and Greed Index is up six points from its value at the end of last week. The largest crypto by market cap has been trading over $100,000 since May 8. On Tuesday, investors digested weaker-than-expected consumer inflation data that has revived expectations of monetary easing by the Federal Reserve. Signs of thawing trade tensions between the United States and China have added to the markets’ stable outlook. Gold loses shine, US dollar halts downtrend, Bitcoin over $102,000 As of 09:30 AM UTC, spot gold had dropped 0.73% to $3,229 per ounce, while US gold futures dipped 0.6% to $3,235. According to market observers, investors began retreating from safe-haven commodities after Washington and Beijing penned a deal on Monday. Kyle Rodda, a financial market analyst at Capital.com , said that if negotiations continue to progress and trade agreements are finalized, gold prices may drop to as low as $3,200, a support level he advised market participants to watch in the near term. The US dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, remained flat at 100.94 during Asian hours after tumbling 0.8% on Tuesday. The previous session’s drop was the largest single-day slide in over three weeks and followed a 1% surge on Monday, which had lifted the index to a one-month high. According to analysts at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the dollar could still see more gains in the near term as traders reassess their positions in light of the recent US-China trade deal. They predicted a 2-3% increase in the dollar index over the next few weeks. Bitcoin also got the better end of the stick after reports of the China-US meeting in Geneva surfaced, crossing the $100,000 mark for the first time since the end of January. According to Alternative.me’s tracker , the Fear and Greed index surged from 31 to 73 in the last 30 days. BTC is now changing hands well over $102,000, a 0.3% uptick intraday, and 6.4% upwards of its weekly lows. Stock markets rebound after trade and inflation concerns ease Most major stock indices have rebounded over the past six weeks, clawing back losses incurred after US President Donald Trump’s tariff announcement at the start of April. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and other US indices returned to positive territory on Wednesday for the month, while European stocks have gone up slightly above levels recorded before Liberation Day . In an interview on Tuesday, President Trump told reporters that he might engage directly with Chinese President Xi Jinping to “iron out the details” of the trade pact. He also reminded the public about America’s ongoing discussions with India , Japan, and South Korea, though no agreements have been announced. Data released by the US Department of Labor on Tuesday showed that the consumer price index rose by 0.2% in April, missing economists’ expectations for a 0.3% increase. This followed a 0.1% decline in March, and has led traders to anticipate as much as 53 basis points in interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve starting in September. The latest read on producer inflation, via the Producer Price Index (PPI), is expected on Thursday and could help the Federal Reserve change or keep its policies come the FOMC meeting on June 18.

Many altcoins have begun to surge in such a scenario, including Pi Network, dogwifhat, and Pepe, which have attracted massive gains. Among them are some who may soon reach the $1 resistance, and a monthly close above this range could trigger a strong AltSeason. Stacks (STX) is trading just below $1, while Optimism (OP), Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET), EOS (EOS), Core (CORE) and Cardano (ADA) are trading between $0.8 and $0.9. While Optimism is leading the race with over 40% weekly gains, the FET price has also surged by more than 22%. Although the Cardano (ADA) price has also attracted nearly 20% gains in the past seven days, the token may continue to struggle to reach $1. Here’s why! The above chart shows the race between these five tokens to reach $1 at the earliest. Among them, the EOS price faced rejection just below $1 during the latest breakout, while the other tokens were restricted below $0.9. However, all the tokens seem to have been gearing up and consolidating within a bull flag, and hence a breakout from this range is expected to push the price above $1. However, the EOS price is facing a decent pullback from the local highs while the selling pressure continues to remain accumulated. The global crypto market cap is rising, which suggests the cryptos are maintaining a healthy ascending trend. The growing optimism around the markets is expected to have a positive impact on these tokens. Hence, the Cardano (ADA) price is expected to reach $1 in May 2025 along with EOS, FET, OP and CORE.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|TRADING|FET|CORE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-14 12:01:28

However, recent persistent resilience in treasury yields suggests a different story — one driven by factors that could be bullish for bitcoin, according to analysts. The U.S. data released Tuesday showed the consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.2% month-on-month for both headline and core in April, below the 0.3% readings expected. That resulted in a headline year-on-year inflation reading of 2.3%, the lowest since February 2021. Still, prices for the 10-year treasury yield, which is influenced by inflation, dropped, pushing the yield higher to 4.5%, the highest since April 11, according to data source TradingView. The so-called benchmark yield is up 30 basis points in May alone and the 30-year yield has increased to 4.94%, sitting near the highest levels of the last 18 years. This has been the theme of late: Yields remain elevated despite all the news about tariff pause, the U.S.-China trade deal and slower inflation. (The 10-year yield surged from 3.8% to 4.6% early last month as trade tensions saw investors sell U.S. assets) The uptick in the so-called risk-free rate usually sparks fears of rotation of money out of stocks and other riskier investments such as crypto and into bonds. The latest yield surge, however, stems from expectations for continued fiscal expansion during President Donald Trump's tenure, according to Spencer Hakimian, founder of Tolou Capital Management. ""Bonds down on a weak CPI day is telling [of] fiscal expansion like crazy,"" Hakimian said on X . ""Everyone plays to win the midterm. Debt and deficits be damned. It's great for Bitcoin, Gold, and Stocks. It's terrible for Bonds."" Hakimian explained that Trump's tax plan would immediately add another $2.5 trillion to the fiscal deficit. In other words, the fiscal policy under Trump will likely be just as expansionary as under Biden, acting as a tailwind for risk assets, including bitcoin. The details of the tax cut plan reported by Bloomberg early this week proposed $4 trillion in tax cuts and about $1.5 trillion in spending cuts, amounting to a fiscal expansion of $2.5 trillion. Arif Husain, head of global fixed income and chief investment officer of the fixed income division at T. Rowe Price, noted that fiscal expansion will soon become the overriding focus for markets. ""Fiscal expansion may be growth supportive, but most importantly, it would likely put even more pressure on the treasury market. I am now even more convinced that the 10‑year U.S. treasury yield will reach 6% in the next 12–18 months,"" Husain said in a blog post. Sovereign risk Per Pseudonymous observer EndGame Macro, the persistent elevated Treasury yields represent fiscal dominance, an idea first discussed by economist Russel Napier a couple of years ago and Maelstrom's CIO and co-founder, Arthur Hayes , last year, and repricing of U.S. sovereign risk. ""When the bond market demands higher yields even as inflation falls, it’s not about the inflation cycle it’s about the sustainability of U.S. debt issuance itself,"" EndGame Macro said on X . The observer explained that higher yields create a self-reinforcing spiral of higher debt servicing costs, which call for more debt issuance (more bond supply) and even higher rates. All this ends up raising the risk of a sovereign debt crisis. BTC, widely seen as an anti-establishment asset and an alternative investment vehicle, could gain more value in this scenario. Moreover, as yields rise, the Fed and the U.S. government could implement yield curve control, or active buying of bonds to cap the 10-year yield from rising beyond a certain level, let's assume 5%. The Fed, therefore, is committed to buy more bonds every time the yield threatens to rise beyond 5%, which inadvertently boosts liquidity in the financial system, galvanizing demand for assets like bitcoin, gold and stocks.",Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|Bonds|bond yields|market analysis|Top Stories|News,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|BTG,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-14 12:03:52

The company’s Q1 report , released on May 13, revealed a 44% year-over-year drop in revenue, falling to $8.8 million. Net losses deepened dramatically, hitting $64.7 million compared to a $6.1 million net income in the same quarter last year. Despite closing the regular trading day with a 5% gain, shares of Semler Scientific (NASDAQ: SMLR) slipped 1.91% in after-hours trading to $36, according to Google Finance. The company’s stock has lost more than 32% of its value so far in 2025. Semler attributed the downturn in its financial performance to reduced medical device revenue. However, it continued to invest heavily in Bitcoin , acquiring 894 BTC during the first quarter. As of March 31, Semler held 3,192 BTC valued at $263.5 million, despite a cumulative fair value decrease of $16.9 million. Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Expands Since the end of Q1 through May 12, Semler purchased an additional 616 BTC for $59.6 million, bringing its total holdings to 3,808 BTC at a fair value of $387.9 million. The company’s total purchase cost now stands at $340 million. Semler noted that it saw an unrealized gain of $41.6 million on its BTC holdings during Q1, which has since risen to $52 million. The firm’s debt-to-Bitcoin net asset value ratio is currently at 25.3%, according to its internal Bitcoin dashboard. In a previous SEC filing on April 15, Semler outlined plans to raise $500 million through a share offering, with some proceeds earmarked for expanding its Bitcoin treasury. Corporate Buying Accelerates Semler is among a growing list of public companies accumulating BTC. According to Bitcointreasuries.net, 104 public firms now hold nearly 787,000 BTC. Leading the pack is Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) with over 568,000 BTC—around 2.7% of BTC total supply. On May 13, stablecoin issuer Tether made headlines after purchasing $459 million worth of Bitcoin on behalf of Twenty One Capital, a company it backs. Twenty One Capital is now the third-largest BTC holder, following Strategy and MARA Holdings. Industry experts like Blockstream CEO Adam Back have suggested that continued institutional demand could trigger “hyperbitcoinization,” potentially propelling Bitcoin’s market cap beyond $200 trillion in the coming decades.

By 2028, CRO could reach a maximum value of $0.3981, with an average trading price of $0.3453. Cronos is expected to reach a maximum level of $1.23 in 2031. Cronos (CRO) is the native cryptocurrency token of the Crypto.com chain, a decentralized, open-source blockchain developed by the Crypto.com payment, trading, and financial services company. CRO aims to power the next generation of decentralized crypto assets and applications and enable real-time, low-cost transactions globally. Cronos cross-bridge mainnet beta suggests a bright future for CRO. This feature aims to improve interoperability between significant blockchain ecosystems, potentially increasing CRO’s attractiveness to developers and users. CRO’s recent performance reflects robust market sentiment and confidence. These factors combined present Cronos as a compelling investment opportunity within the dynamic cryptocurrency market. Eminem’s involvement comes when Crypto.com has been actively expanding its visibility through various high-profile partnerships, such as with actor Matt Damon and major sports teams. In this Cronos price prediction, we’ll explore the future market trends of CRO price and its current price momentum using in-depth technical analysis and price prediction model.

Price faces repeated rejection at $0.1039, making it the key level to break for further gains. CRO is consolidating between $0.09877 and $0.1039, suggesting a breakout is likely soon. Cronos (CRO) is trading at $0.1015 on May 14, 2025, posting a 2.63% increase over the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency displays a steady uptrend with a solid hold above the psychological $0.10 mark. Current price action places resistance at $0.1039 and support at $0.09877, indicating a balanced structure between bulls and bears. CRO is currently down 89.53% from its all-time high of $0.9698, recorded on November 24, 2021. Despite this steep decline, the token is regaining traction. Cronos 1-day price chart: CRO maintains bullish momentum above key $0.10 level CRO has successfully defended the $0.09877 support level on the daily timeframe, forming a bullish structure above this base. The current upward move has pushed the price to $0.1015, with bulls eyeing a breakout past $0.1039, which acts as immediate resistance. Price tested this zone earlier, but momentum failed to breach it. However, multiple attempts suggest mounting pressure that could resolve to the upside. CRO Price Chart The chart structure shows a series of higher lows, indicating sustained buyer control. The RSI level trades at 61.45, suggesting buyers are in control. There’s visible rejection at lower levels, signaling buyers are defending dips aggressively. Volume spikes during local highs indicate increased interest near resistance, though a confirmed breakout requires a close above $0.104 on high volume. A move toward $0.106–$0.108 becomes plausible if the price holds this ascending trajectory. Cronos 4-hour price chart: CRO coils between $0.09877 support and $0.1039 resistance On the 4-hour chart, CRO remains range-bound between $0.09877 and $0.1039, with price consolidating just above the key psychological level of $0.10. The intraday structure shows alternating tests of resistance and support, but no breakout confirmation has occurred. CRO Price Chart The 4-hour chat shows continuous bearish pressure around $0.104. Price has failed to make a decisive move above $0.1039, which remains a strong ceiling. However, buyers continue to defend dips to $0.099, highlighting localized demand. A clear break above $0.1039 would shift momentum toward bulls, targeting the next zone near $0.106. Failure to break higher could lead to another pullback to test the lower end of the range.

Cronos (CRO) is currently consolidating in a tight range between $0.09877 and $0.1039, with price hovering just above the psychological support at $0.10. This setup suggests an imminent breakout, as the market compresses and volume fluctuates near key technical zones. If CRO breaks above $0.1039 with substantial volume, the next target lies between $0.106 and $0.108, potentially extending the short-term uptrend. However, failure to clear this resistance could trigger a retest of the $0.09877 support level, possibly leading to further sideways movement or a deeper pullback. Market sentiment remains cautiously bullish, with multiple higher lows and strong dip buying indicating underlying strength. Traders should watch for a confirmed close above $0.104 on substantial volume for a bullish continuation, or a drop below $0.0987 for signs of weakness. Is Cronos a good investment? CRO shows short-term strength with solid support at $0.10 and signs of accumulation, suggesting bullish potential if it breaks above $0.1039. The chart shows higher lows and stable volume, favoring a possible breakout. Long-term, the project benefits from ecosystem growth and DeFi integration, but it’s still down 89.53% from its ATH, making it a high-risk asset. It may appeal to traders and high-risk investors, but it is less suited for conservative portfolios. Why is Cronos up today? Cronos (CRO) is up 2.63% today, trading at $0.1015 as of May 14, 2025. The price increase is driven by strong support at $0.10 and renewed buying momentum near the $0.09877 support level, which has held firm over multiple sessions. Will Cronos recover? Cronos (CRO) shows potential for recovery, as Crypto.com aims to broaden its financial services with ambitious 2025 plans. The platform intends to launch its stablecoin, introduce ETFs, and offer stock trading options, targeting a deeper integration with traditional finance and expanding its user base in the U.S. market. Will Cronos reach $0.5? Based on long-term forecasts, Cronos (CRO) is projected to reach $0.5 by 2029 as its ecosystem and user adoption continue to grow. Will Cronos reach $1? Projections for Cronos estimate it could reach $1 by 2031, driven by its expansion in DeFi, NFT integrations, and partnerships. Will Cronos reach $100? It is unlikely that Cronos’s price will reach $100, as this would require an extremely high market capitalization beyond the current Cro coin price prediction for the crypto sector. Does Cronos have an excellent long-term future? Cronos CRO holds promising long-term potential due to Crypto.com ’s ongoing innovations, such as DEX expansions, NFT integration, and metaverse applications, collectively enhancing CRO’s appeal and utility. These strategic initiatives, along with CRO’s liquidity and staking rewards, position it as a solid investment for those with a long-term perspective Cronos price prediction May 2025 For May, Cronos (CRO) is primed for promising growth with significant price movements.

In 2020, CRO rose steadily, reaching above $0.20 by August before dropping to $0.06 by year-end. In 2021, CRO followed the crypto bull run, surpassing previous highs and achieving an all-time high of $0.9698 on November 24, boosted by listings on Coinbase Pro and Bitrue. CRO opened 2022 at $0.5575 but fell to $0.4409, partially due to concerns over a potential security breach on the Crypto.com platform, which temporarily suspended withdrawals in January. In 2023, Cronos experienced a peak in mid-March near $0.80, followed by a steep decline and stabilization around $0.20 by mid-year. It maintained a slight oscillation around this range in the following months. CRO started 2024 at $0.10, rallied to a yearly high of $0.18 in March, and declined to $0.12 by June. It stabilized between $0.08–$0.10 from July to October, traded at $0.07193–$0.09521 in November, and ended the year in a range of $0.138–$0.234 in December. In January 2025, Cronos traded within the range of $0.158 to $0.163 but lost momentum towards the end of the month, leading to a trading range of $0.1005 – $0.160 in February. Later in March, Cronos traded within the range of $0.08076 and $0.0950. However, after touching the $0.1 mark by the end of March, Cronos price triggered a bearish rally. In April, the CRO price declined heavily due to rising trade war between US and China. The Cronos price dropped toward the low of $0.08.

OORT’s Diverse Tools Kaggle data set listing was released in early April; since then, it has climbed to the first page in multiple categories. Kaggle is a Google-owned online platform for data science and machine learning competitions, learning and collaboration. Ramkumar Subramaniam, core contributor at crypto AI project OpenLedger, told Cointelegraph that “a front-page Kaggle ranking is a strong social signal, indicating that the data set is engaging the right communities of data scientists, machine learning engineers and practitioners.“ Max Li, founder and CEO of OORT, told Cointelegraph that the firm “observed promising engagement metrics that validate the early demand and relevance” of its training data gathered through a decentralized model. He added: “The organic interest from the community, including active usage and contributions — demonstrates how decentralized, community-driven data pipelines like OORT’s can achieve rapid distribution and engagement without relying on centralized intermediaries.“ Li also said that in the coming months, OORT plans to release multiple other data sets. Among those is an in-car voice commands data set, one for smart home voice commands and another one for deepfake videos meant to improve AI-powered media verification.

The pressure is high enough that investors are now mediating deals giving rights to copyrighted materials to AI companies. Reports concerning increasingly scarce AI training data and how it may limit growth in the space have been circulating for years. While synthetic (AI-generated) data is increasingly used with at least some degree of success, human data is still largely viewed as the better alternative, higher-quality data that leads to better AI models. When it comes to images for AI training specifically, things are becoming increasingly complicated with artists sabotaging training efforts on purpose.

Source: TowardsDataScience Subramaniam said, “We’re entering an era where high-quality image data will become increasingly scarce.” He also recognized that this scarcity is made more dire by the increasing popularity of image poisoning: “With the rise of techniques like image cloaking and adversarial watermarking to poison AI training, open-source datasets face a dual challenge: quantity and trust.” In this situation, Subramaniam said that verifiable and community-sourced incentivized data sets are “more valuable than ever.” According to him, such projects “can become not just alternatives, but pillars of AI alignment and provenance in the data economy.“ Magazine: AI Eye: AI’s trained on AI content go MAD, is Threads a loss leader for AI data?",,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-14 12:18:12

Better-than-expected US inflation data and a US-China trade agreement have reincentivised risk-on sentiment, opening the doors to fresh retail liquidity. The move concludes a two-month-long consolidation phase, range-bound between $2 and $1.40. Clear of this hurdle, Grass Network has a new standing in the “best crypto to buy” conversation. What’s Pushing the $GRASS Surge? Today’s $GRASS price surge seems fueled by organic spot demand rather than speculative interest, with no major fundamental developments driving the move. The derivatives market remains bullish, but balanced. The 24-hour Long/Short Ratio sits at 1.27, according to CoinGlass data —just 55% of traders are betting on increases. Open interest is also on a steady uptrend rather than a one-off spike, an indicator of sustained growth. Grass Open Interest.

GRASS / USDT 1-day chart, symmetrical triangle breakout. Source: TradingView / Bybit. With the breakdown of an earlier ascending triangle priced in, Grass has fully exhausted its bearish momentum. With wider market headwinds clearing, it now has the fundamental backing for a surge. If momentum continues, the pattern sets a breakout target around $5.75, representing a potential 160% surge from current prices. This outlook is supported by the MACD, which continues to widen its lead above the signal line—often an early sign of a sustained mid-term trend. That said, the sharp upward move has pushed the RSI beyond the overbought threshold at 70, currently sitting at 72. This could be a precursor to a correction as buying reaches exhaustion. A false breakout here could trigger a pullback, potentially retesting the $2 level as a resistance zone turned support.

Dogecoin (DOGE) follows this trend, flipping its ceiling after a noteworthy upward movement. However, the Solana price has faced rejection at its resistance level despite its recent pump. Meanwhile, the Unilabs presale is gaining strong momentum, raising over $85,000. Analysts have tipped the project to become one of the best altcoins to watch this year. Best Altcoin of 2025? Unilabs Presale Surges with $0.004 Price Unilabs is designed to allow investors access to many investment opportunities with the help of artificial intelligence. The asset management platform already has over $30 million in AUM, prompting shouts of the best altcoin 2025. The protocol’s AI-powered Memecoin Identification Tool helps identify promising opportunities in the memecoin market. Its advanced memecoin identification feature accesses and grades top memecoin projects using factors such as liquidity, listing probability, and market hype. Further, the hedge fund serves as an investment vehicle across Bitcoin, AI, mining, and RWA Funds. Through this offering, users could gain exposure to several crypto sectors and engage in emerging projects. Its AI Market Pulse feature uses artificial intelligence to monitor several market activities and on-chain movements, thus providing users with detailed data for improved portfolio management. Unilabs' ICO phase has witnessed massive market acceptance, crossing the $85,000 mark at the time of writing. Buyers are increasing their UNIL stash at an affordable $0.004 per token. Projects with low entry barriers have historically performed favorably post-launch. Considering this precedent, early UNIL token adopters could witness impressive returns once it hits major exchanges. With the DOGE token, alongside the Solana price trading at a high amount, UNIL’s low market price allows retail traders to enter the market without breaking the bank. Dogecoin (DOGE) Takes Off as Bullish Momentum Builds Dogecoin could be set for a sustained uptrend after breaking a key barrier and flashing bullish signals. The DOGE token has recovered from previous lows in the past month, flipping the $0.22 resistance level. At the press time, Dogecoin trades around $0.24 after skyrocketing nearly 44% month-to-date. Source: TradingView The DOGE price outlook is bullish, and buyers have stepped in at this level. Experts predict the Dogecoin rally will continue, supported by notable technical indicators. For instance, the DOGE token’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently neutral at 55.7, hinting at a potential uptrend. Likewise, the Dogecoin MACD is showing a slight bullish divergence, which means the DOGE rally could continue in the long term. In addition, Dogecoin is trading above the 200-day SMA, an indicator that an upward trend would persist. If current momentum holds, DOGE could surpass the $0.27 threshold in the near term. However, these projections remain speculative. Meanwhile, Unilabs is attracting attention as a top crypto project in 2025 amid the current Solana price struggle. Solana Faces Resistance at $180 Level Since the turn of the year, the Solana price has shown considerable volatility. In January, the asset surged remarkably, following the positive outlook regarding President Trump’s government. In the following months, the Solana price slipped below the $200 mark and failed to exceed this level. At the time of writing, the asset is hovering around $175, reflecting a 21% uptick in the past week. Despite this upward trend, the recent Solana price action shows SOL facing rejection at a critical price zone around $180. Source: TradingView This level has previously acted as a significant barrier, capping upward momentum and triggering short-term pullbacks. If the Solana price fails to break above and hold above the $180 mark, the token could consolidate or even retrace toward lower support levels. As a result, retail traders are pivoting to Unilabs following its impressive ICO run. Conclusion Dogecoin (DOGE) has flipped its $0.22 barrier following strings of impressive market outings. However, the Solana price has yet to surpass its current resistance level even after an impressive month-to-date run. On the other hand, Unilabs is experiencing remarkable presale numbers as crypto watchers highlight its AI backed offerings. With the ICO entry price pegged at $0.004, historical trends support the project's potential success. Hence, investors should jump in before the predicted price climb.

The FIU is concerned that a terror threat may be imminent and that crypto could be used to fund military operations. The FIU particularly interests Pahalgam tokens and Operation Sindoor on the Solana blockchain. Indian authorities have asked exchanges to be on the lookout for terror funding and money laundering. Indian authorities seem to be concerned about private wallets that escape the purview of financial regulators, because centralised exchanges have very little control over what people do with their private wallets, including but not limited to military operations. The FIU, therefore, has asked exchanges to report crypto activities associated with border areas. The FIU requested major crypto exchanges in India. They advised the exchanges to be on high alert for suspicious transactions. The FIU is responsible for investigating financial crimes in India. There has been a growing amount of tension building ever since India and Pakistan had a conflict. Indian officials may suspect that the conflict is not over yet and may spread to the Kashmir and Jammu regions. The FIU has asked exchanges to monitor transactions, especially those involving private wallets. Despite most exchanges holding custodial rights over a customer’s crypto, this doesn’t give the exchange control over where customers send their crypto. Such a loophole could be exploited by military groups that could fund operations by sending money to private wallets. The money could then be mixed so the original sender is not caught. Indian authorities are concerned that private wallets could make it challenging to track illicit funds, such as those used in terror financing and money laundering. It would take a lot of work for the FIU to track all transactions from exchanges to private wallets. This would be difficult for Indian officials to track, let alone without further mixing tokens to obfuscate a transaction trail. Despite these obstacles, Indian officials still have much control over the crypto market and can compel exchanges to comply with their wishes. The exchanges could disregard regular business transactions and focus on outliers instead. The exchanges could further concentrate on danger areas, such as border locations with concentrated separatist movements. The FIU requires Indian exchanges to create ‘suspicious transaction reports’ so that the organisation can investigate the source of the funds. India has stringent crypto laws and a concerted effort to track private wallets, and crypto users must report their activities. India has introduced new rules that require crypto users to report the identity of beneficiary addresses when sending funds to a private wallet. India is concerned about private wallets because a user on an exchange could transfer money to a private wallet and then swap the token for anonymous tokens like Monero or Zcash. The user could, theoretically speaking, make a payment to anyone, including terror groups. This issue has become a problem for other crypto projects, such as Ethereum, that wish to increase privacy features while also confirming that tokens have not originated from illicit trades. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) recently raided a scam cryptocurrency called ‘Emollient Coin’ by raiding locations in Leh, Jammu, and Sonipat. The crypto project promised customers they could double their money in 10 months. India’s ED uncovered an extensive network of fraudulent crypto activities, including 7,200 mule accounts used for laundering money and 1,000 investors defrauded by the scheme. A core aspect of the project was converting illicit fiat money to cryptocurrencies, so bad actors could enjoy the benefits of liquidity.",Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News|India,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-14 13:23:02

Announced on May 14, the program reflects Ethereum’s ( ETH ) ambition to serve as “civilization-scale infrastructure” that rivals and surpasses legacy financial systems in safety and resilience. The initiative will be led by Fredrik Svantes, the Foundation’s Protocol Security Lead, and Josh Stark of the EF management team. This initiative could be a catalyst for future price gains, as investors weigh its potential to boost institutional trust and onchain adoption. Over the past day, Ethereum has experienced a substantial price increase. As of May 14, 2025, ETH is trading at approximately $2,611.09, marking a 3.68% rise over the last 24 hours, according to crypto.news data. Ethereum’s price has rallied over 50% in the past week. These gains are attributed to factors such as increased institutional interest and positive market sentiment following the Pectra upgrade .

These include samczsun, founder of the Security Alliance and security advisor at Paradigm; Mehdi Zerouali, co-founder of blockchain security firm Sigma Prime; and Zach Obront, co-founder of Etherealize and a contributor to OP Succinct.

Solana remains the fourth-largest cryptocurrency in the entire ecosystem, with a market cap approximately $20 billion smaller than Tether, which holds the third position. Moreover, as seen from its recent price action, SOL recovered sharply from its slump to $100, making it a high volume launch pad propelling towards $500. This analysis illustrates solid arguments for Solana’s rapid rise to $500 as against Remittix's potential 1,000% gains in 2025. Solana’s rising whale activity and holdings instill market confidence Solana’s on-chain data from DeFiLama reveals notable market play as FTX/Alameda’s staking address recently unstaked 187,625 SOL valued at $32.24 million, yet still retains a massive 5.2 million SOL ($913.5 million) in staking. Meanwhile, a dormant whale unstaked 103,040 SOL worth a whopping $17.7 million, retaining over 3.36 million SOL ($584 million) in their portfolio. Source: Tradingview While these positive developments often precede profit-taking or reallocation, the retained SOL indicates sustained market confidence that the Solana price is on the verge of a massive rally. Solana meme coin boom and growing institutional interest instigates bullish sentiment Zooming out, the $500 Solana price prediction is not far-fetched, especially with its booming meme coin market and growing institutional interest. CoinMarketCap data reports that Bonk, Dogwifhat, Popcat, and Peanut the Squirrel have doubled the Solana meme coin market cap from $6 billion in April to $15 billion. This surge is bringing market interest back to Solana, alongside its institutional adoption receiving a boost from the growing anticipation for spot Solana ETFs. Applications from VanEck, 21Shares, Grayscale, and Bitwise are under SEC review pending their due date on June 19th. If approved, especially with staking allowed, an ETF expert, JPMorgan, estimates $6 billion+ in inflows during the first year. Source: Bitget With such market inflow, Solana’s market cap is bound to triple, while pushing its price above $500. Solana’s technical analysis: Key levels to watch for a $500 breakout The Solana price is currently trading in an accumulation zone around $200. If bulls can push through this area, the next major level to watch is the weekly time frame resistance at $250. This level has acted as a significant area in previous cycles and may once again offer strong resistance. Source: CoinMarketCap Meanwhile, Ali Martinez spotted a bullish cup and handle pattern in Solana’s weekly price action. According to the analyst, Solana is on the verge of clearing the $200 mark to enter a massive bull run. Remittix emerges as bull run favorite as Analysts expect a 1,000% surge in Q2 Remittix (RTX) continues to exceed even the most bullish of expectations. Since launching its presale at just $0.015, Remittix's native token, RTX, has surged over 550% and is now available at $0.0757. As the presale continues, there will be a further 1,000% surge as anticipation rises for the bull cycle in Q2. Source: Remittix Powered by its innovative PayFi protocol, Remittix allows users to send funds directly into global bank accounts using cryptocurrency. The PayFi upstart supports more than 30 fiat currencies, making it a game-changer for the crypto and traditional finance (TradFi) industries. As more users rely on blockchain-based solutions for remittances and everyday payments, Remittix is in pole position to receive massive inflows. Moreover, if Remittix manages to secure partnerships, refine its ecosystem, and maintain a transparent development process, a 5000% return is not out of the question. Conclusion The $500 Solana price prediction is turning heads, but all eyes are on Remittix’s potential 1,000% upside. As usual, the crypto market remains unpredictable, but altcoins with genuine utility like Remittix often hold up better during market corrections. If the team behind Remittix efficiently navigates the $190 trillion global payment sector while keeping fees low and payment times speedy, it could cement a spot in the crypto top ten rankings.

In a press release on Monday, the index confirmed that Coinbase will replace Discover Financial Services to become a part of it on May 19 th . The announcement sent Coinbase shares up more than 25% in recent sessions. Continued buying momentum in COIN stock signals it may be headed to print a new year-to-date high in the months ahead. What the S&P 500 news means for Coinbase investors? Winning a spot on the S&P 500 is a significant development for Coinbase as index inclusion often serves as a material tailwind for a company’s stock price . Part of what drives their share prices up is a meaningful increase in demand that follows a business’s addition to the benchmark index. For example, exchange-traded funds, pension funds, and other institutional investors tend to focus more on companies that are listed on the S&P 500 index. Additionally, funds that track the S&P 500 will now have to invest in Coinbase, further boosting the demand for the crypto stock through the remainder of 2025. Finally, Coinbase’s inclusion in the benchmark S&P 500 index is broadly a vote of confidence in its financial and operational stature, which may sound more appealing to traditional investors. What does Coinbase news mean for top meme coins? On May 19 th , Coinbase will become the first and only crypto company to join the benchmark S&P 500 index – a watershed moment for crypto industry, signalling mainstream financial acceptance.

Best meme coins like Moo Deng and Bitcoin Pepe stand just as much a chance to take advantage of this recent development. Why? Because Coinbase’s entry into the prestigious index improves the overall legitimacy of the crypto market. Conventional investors, who may have previously dismissed crypto as a niche or volatile sector, will now see it as a stable, investable space. But not all can afford to invest in space leaders like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Retail traders often turn to new meme coins in search of quick returns during a crypto bull market. This could lead to increased interest in alternative crypto assets, including top meme coins like Bitcoin Pepe and Moo Deng. Plus, increased institutional attention means higher liquidity and more avenues for trading. When crypto gains mainstream traction, exchanges see a surge in volume, which often trickles down to lesser-known tokens. The likes Bitcoin Pepe and Moo Deng, with their meme-driven appeal, stand to attract new buyers looking for speculative opportunities amidst such a backdrop.

Thailand’s Ministry of Finance will organise the bond issuance. Pichai Chunhavajira, the Finance Minister, announced the tokenized bonds, saying that the G-tokens will be used to raise funds for the government, conform to the current budget plan, and enable the public to buy bonds for personal wealth creation. Chunhavajira said that the public can buy the bonds at an affordable price. The bonds will allow the public to earn more than a savings account at a local bank. Thailand banks currently offer savings accounts with around 1.5% interest. The G-token will only be available to Thai citizens. Chunhavajira said that the tokens will be made available on licensed crypto exchanges. The initial offering of $150 million is worth around 5 billion baht. Chunhavajira also noted that this was just the beginning and that if this initial offering were successful, the Ministry of Finance would issue more bonds for the public. The G-token is neither a cryptocurrency nor a form of currency. Thailand’s government is releasing the G-token as an investment option for the public, to stimulate growth and provide funding for the public sector at the same time. G-tokens’ issuance seems to combine the benefits of low threshold investing with digitised assets. Public members may not be interested in government bonds, but may buy digitised bonds that they can buy on a crypto exchange. The issuance of G-tokens may also introduce many younger traders to the world of bond trading. With the current trade disruptions and economic shortfalls after the pandemic, bond trading may be a sensible option for traders. Public members can buy G-tokens for as low as 100 baht, roughly $3. The Bank of Thailand helped draft the bond issuance plan. The low G-tokens threshold will allow low-income people to afford the investment. The release of the G-tokens will happen within the next two months. Government bonds are often released at a much higher amount, such as 40 billion baht, much higher than the G-token amount of only 5 billion baht. Patchara Anuntasilpa, director general of public debt, said that the G-tokens were not a form of traditional debt instruments, but rather were part of a plan to improve the country’s budget borrowing plan and to make financial investments more accessible for the general public. The bond market has traditionally been limited to wealthy traders and businesses. This government-backed plan will improve accessibility for retail traders. It may also be a good opportunity for regular citizens to use digital assets. The bond offering may improve the general public’s financial literacy, which has the added benefit of protecting retail traders from scammers. In January, former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, father of current prime minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, announced that the government should start issuing its stablecoins. Shinawatra believes that the stock market has suffered due to the public losing trust in financial institutions. He suggested that the government should clamp down on corruption so that people can regain their confidence in the stock market again.",Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News|Thailand,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-14 13:29:08

UBS and Morgan Stanley report growing client focus on risk budgeting and diversification. Hong Kong stocks surge as U.S.-China trade tensions ease and investment outlook stabilizes. According to UBS executives, wealthy investors are reducing exposure to U.S. dollar-denominated assets and moving capital toward Chinese markets, gold, and alternative investments. The trend has expanded following decreased trade tensions between the United States and China, and rising interest in China’s evolving innovation sectors.

Former CEO Daniel Schatt and former CFO Joseph Podulka admitted to the charges as part of a plea deal reached with federal prosecutors, according to a May 13 court filing in the U.S. District Court for Northern California. U.S. District Judge William Alsup accepted the guilty pleas and scheduled sentencing for August 26. Each executive faces up to 20 years in prison and fines up to $250,000. Businesses convicted of wire fraud can face up to $500,000 in penalties. According to court documents, Schatt and Podulka acknowledged misleading investors by only sharing positive updates about the firm while withholding negative developments. The aim, prosecutors said, was to convince customers to deposit their digital and fiat currencies with Cred under false pretenses. Customer Losses Reached $150M Cred filed for bankruptcy in November 2020, leaving thousands of customers with estimated losses of up to $150 million. As part of their plea deal, Schatt and Podulka admitted that their actions directly led to user losses ranging from $65 million to $150 million. Despite the initial devastation, the U.S. Department of Justice noted in a May 2024 update that assets recovered from the case had appreciated and now hold a market value of over $783 million. However, that has not prevented legal action from proceeding against those deemed responsible. The executives were initially charged with 13 counts of wire fraud and money laundering. Prosecutors are also recommending a prison sentence of up to 72 months for Schatt and up to 62 months for Podulka. Crypto Fraud Cases Continue to Mount Former chief commercial officer James Alexander has also been charged in the same case. The prosecution also argued that Cred misrepresented its risk exposure, falsely claimed that all lending was collateralized, and failed to disclose its dependence on unsecured microloans issued by Chinese company MoKredit. Cred is just one of several crypto companies facing legal scrutiny in recent months. On May 8, former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky was sentenced to 12 years in prison for fraud. Earlier this year, Travis Ford, co-founder of Wolf Capital, pleaded guilty to wire fraud conspiracy after raising over $9 million from investors with false promises of high returns.

Still, some industry observers remain cautious about the likelihood of near-term regulatory change. “All three major South Korean presidential candidates support #Bitcoin ETFs and institutional investment,” Ki Young Ju, the founder and CEO of onchain data platform CryptoQuant, wrote in a May 14 X post. Currently, Bitcoin ETFs and institutional crypto investments are banned in South Korea, meaning that “100% [of the] volume comes from retail,” Ju added.

The Democratic Party made similar promises in its 2024 election campaign, including the legalization of spot crypto ETFs , but progress has been delayed, KED reported. Related: SEC delays Solana ETF as decisions for Polkadot, XRP loom Candidates back ETFs, but history casts doubt While the crypto-friendly perspectives of the leading candidates suggest a promising future for digital asset legislation in South Korea, regulation experts remain skeptical. “The candidates’ pro-crypto pledges to push to legalize spot Bitcoin ETFs and reduce fees signal a potential shift. But history tempers optimism,” Anndy Lian, author and intergovernmental blockchain adviser, told Cointelegraph, adding: “They will take on similar stances as Hong Kong. Whether the ETFs can perform or not depends on various other factors.” “A pro-crypto president could drive reform, aligning South Korea with global trends like the US, where Bitcoin ETFs have attracted over billions in net inflows,” Lian said, adding that the Financial Services Commission’s tone also suggested “regulatory openness” for cryptocurrencies. However, the People Power Party, elected in 2022, also promised to lift the crypto ETF ban and revise the controversial one-exchange-one-bank rule, “but failed to act before President Yoon’s impeachment,” Lian said. Over in Hong Kong, the first batch of Bitcoin and Ether-based ETFs launched for trading on April 30, 2024, but saw disappointing trading activity compared to their US counterparts, Cointelegraph reported.

Long perpetuals and futures accounted for $17.4 million of the total, indicating a 46% to 54% balance between bullish and bearish ill-fated bets. Is it better to go long or short on BTC in May? Looking ahead, technicals show a slight bias toward short positions. Bitcoin’s 14-day relative strength index ( RSI ) has climbed to 71.19, thanks to the latest rally, positioning the cryptocurrency as overbought. Selling pressure, however, is likely to be prevalent only in the shorter timeframes. BTC is well above its nearest support at $102,233 and almost guaranteed to evade a deeper plunge if it stays above the psychologically important threshold of $100,000.

ETH/USD is showing a bearish divergence on the four-hour chart, hinting at a potential 10–15% price correction. Despite the near-term risks, some analysts view a pullback as a “buy-the-dip” setup before a possible move toward $3,500–$3,800. Ether ( ETH ) has surged over 50% month-to-date in May, vastly outperforming the broader crypto market’s 15.25% gain. The rally has pushed Ethereum’s market dominance (ETH.D) toward the critical 10% threshold for the first time since March. But the rising dominance accompanies signs of overheating, indicating that Ethereum bulls should not celebrate the rally just yet. Ether’s RSI most overextended since May 2021 The strong recovery in Ethereum’s crypto market share has pushed its daily relative strength index (RSI) to its most overbought zone since May 2021, raising red flags for traders betting on further upside, at least in the short term. Historically, such extreme RSI levels on ETH.D have marked the beginning of major pullbacks. One notable instance occurred in early July 2024, when ETH dominance peaked near similar RSI levels. ETH.D daily performance chart. Source: TradingView Over the following 315 days, ETH.D dropped by more than 17.5%. The current RSI spike, again above 80, mimics a similar setup, suggesting that Ethereum could be nearing a local top in its market share. Adding to the bearish outlook, ETH.D remains below its 200-day exponential moving average (200-day EMA; the blue wave). This resistance level has repeatedly capped Ethereum’s dominance during previous recovery attempts. Previous overbought pullbacks have initially pushed Ethereum’s market share toward its 50-day EMA (the red wave). The ETH.D metric, therefore, risks declining toward its current 50-day EMA support at around 8.24% by June, suggesting potential capital rotation out of Ethereum markets to other coins in the coming weeks. Bearish divergence signals 15% ETH price drop On the four-hour ETH/USD chart, a classic bearish divergence is emerging, where Ethereum’s price continues to print higher highs, but momentum indicators trend lower. Crypto trader AlphaBTC noted that ETH is showing “three clear drives of divergence,” a setup often preceding trend exhaustion. He added that key Fibonacci levels align with potential support zones, suggesting a pullback could be imminent. ETH/USD four-hour price chart. Source: AlphaBTC With ETH hovering near the $2,740 Fibonacci extension, profit-taking pressure may intensify, opening the door for a short-term correction toward lower Fib levels at around $2,330 or even $2,190, down 10%-15% from the current prices. Independent market analyst Michaël van de Poppe suggests ETH’s decline in the coming weeks could serve as a “buy-the-dip opportunity,” indicating that the cryptocurrency would eventually climb over $3,500.

At the time of writing, the daily crypto trading volume is $157 billion, back to the levels we typically see. All top 10 coins are back to green today. Ethereum (ETH) is the category’s best performer. It’s up 4.9% to $2,601. It’s followed by Dogecoin (DOGE) , which increased by 4.1%, trading at $0.2363. At the same time, Bitcoin (BTC) recorded the smallest increase, appreciating 0.3% to the current price of $103,845. Looking at the top 100 coins per market cap, we find only nine in the red, four of which fell by more than 1%. Dogwifhat (WIF) dropped the most: 4.3%, changing hands at $1.1. Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) follows with a 2.7% drop to $1.99. On the other hand, Raydium (RAY) is the day’s best performer. It’s up 17.3%, currently trading at $3.73. Ethena (ENA) also saw a double-digit rise of 12.2% to the price of $0.4258. Fetch.ai and Rivalz Bring AI Inference On-Chain Infrastructure provider Rivalz Network and Fetch.ai , an AI company and founding member of the ASI Alliance , announced a collaboration to bring Fetch.ai’s proprietary ASI-1 LLM model into Rivalz’s Agentic Data Coordination System (ADCS). The integration enables decentralized applications ( dapps ) to access advanced AI inference directly on-chain. Smart contracts can send inference requests to the ASI-1 model and receive responses on-chain. Therefore, developers can design AI-powered dapps that make data-driven decisions in real time. They can send requests for AI analysis, such as market predictions or content generation, without the high cost of on-chain computation. Instead, AI processing happens off-chain, and the result is delivered to the blockchain. Rivalz [ADCS] and @Fetch_ai join forces! ASI-1 LLM Now Live on ADCS @Fetch_ai ’s cutting-edge ASI-1 LLM is now integrated into Rivalz’s ADCS, empowering smart contracts with real-time AI for DeFi predictions, smart contract automation, generative NFTs, and more. Every request… pic.twitter.com/TOBWe8Cgi9 — Rivalz Network (@Rivalz_AI) May 14, 2025 Furthermore, the integration will boost the functionality of dapps across various sectors, the team argues. In DeFi, smart contracts can incorporate real-time AI predictions into trading algorithms and execute transactions. NFT platforms can utilize ASI-1’s generative capabilities to create unique art or content at the point of minting. Additionally, supply chain and logistics dapps can leverage AI-driven forecasting to optimize operations and manage demand more effectively. “In each of these cases, ADCS simplifies the developer’s work by handling the off-chain data fetching and the secure transmission of verified results. Developers no longer need to build their own AI pipelines or manually verify every data feed, as the ADCS framework takes care of these tasks in a decentralized and trustless manner,” the press release says. BitPay Launches HODL Pay, Expands DeFi Payment Options Crypto exchange BitPay has announced the launch of HODL Pay , its new payment option for consumers and merchants. According to the press release, HODL Pay connects decentralized finance ( DeFi ) with everyday commerce. Users can borrow stablecoins from DeFi against their crypto holdings and pay BitPay invoices at checkout. Source: BitPay Users can use the borrowed funds for any purchase, including shopping, travel, vehicles, luxury goods, and more. Users can also pay credit card bills. Therefore, consumers can keep their crypto and “stay invested while instantly accessing liquidity in stablecoins to meet immediate spending needs,” the exchange says. To use HODL Pay, users must have/create a supply position on Aave , collateral for borrowing. Then, they generate a BitPay invoice by shopping with a BitPay merchant, signing up for Bill Pay, or purchasing a crypto-powered gift card. Once they connect a crypto wallet using WalletConnect , they can borrow stablecoins and complete the payment. Wire Network Taps Microsoft, Animoca, Figment Vets Wire Network has announced that it’s expanding the leadership team with four new executive hires, following the hire of WallStreetBets founder Jaime Rogozinski as Chief Strategy Officer. Per the press release shared with Cryptonews , the goal is to help the team solve crypto’s problem of fragmentation. The team has welcomed Nick Greenawalt as Chief Marketing Officer, Will Little as Chief Operating Officer, Gavin Gillas as Head of Strategic Partnerships, and Rick Grimes as VP of Operations.

Now trading at $2.61, XRP’s market cap has surged to nearly $153 billion, once again pushing it ahead of Tether. The recent US-China deal talks have lifted the market sentiment, with XRP rising 7-12% in the last three days. What’s Driving the Surge? XRP has upheld the bullish trend as crypto markets see continued momentum. The rally, now in its second week of gains, is driven by a $1 billion surge in Open Interest. $XRP Futures Open Interest has surged by over $1B in the past week, rising from $2.42B to $3.42B (+41.6%). This sharp increase in leverage coincides with a price rally from $2.14 to $2.48, suggesting elevated speculative activity and growing directional conviction, pic.twitter.com/QbsaOM9oxE — glassnode (@glassnode) May 13, 2025 XRP futures open interest rose from $2.42 billion to $3.42 billion in just a week, according to data from Glassnode. This $1 billion increase shows more money is flowing into XRP and more traders are betting on big price moves ahead. Another factor behind XRP’s rally is the growth in XRP wallets, with nearly 6.5 million non-empty wallets, the highest in its 12-year history. Over 638,000 new wallets were added in early 2025, which shows strong interest, both retail and institutional. XRP’s RSI remains neutral, and most moving averages are flashing buy signals. The MACD also shows bullish momentum. Will XRP Outperform Ethereum? According to Standard Chartered, XRP will overtake Ethereum in market cap by 2028, driven by its core utility as a platform for cross-border and cross-currency payments. Analyst Geoffrey Kendrick sees XRP as a top performer alongside Bitcoin and Avalanche, while Ethereum is viewed as an underperformer in the digital asset space. The XRP ETF has also seen five consecutive weeks of inflows, with $14 million added this week, up from $10 million last week. There’s also growing speculation that the SEC will approve XRP ETFs, which could further boost demand. Analysts believe XRP ETF inflows could hit $8 billion in its first year, surpassing Ethereum’s ETF performance. Another analyst, the Modern Investor, recently shared that if XRP’s price doubles to $5.20, it could overtake Ethereum and become the second-largest crypto. Attorney John Deaton also believes that XRP has more appeal to Wall Street than they are willing to admit, and it could flip Ethereum by the end of this year. However, Ethereum has also taken pace recently, nearing the $2,700 mark. It has gained nearly 50% in the past two weeks, and it remains to be seen if XRP will be able to leave Ether behind.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ethereum|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-14 13:44:02

Believe is a mobile app through which crypto enthusiasts can launch new meme coins and tokens that they want to promote. It works similarly to Pump.fun. The tokens are minted in the Solana blockchain and they will be available to be bought and sold through decentralized exchanges like Jupiter. According to data from Onchain Lens, a whale bought $1.56 million to buy 9.55 million LAUNCHOIN tokens. This is a big move for a token with a market cap of just $176 million. A whale spent $1.56M $USDT to buy 9.55M $LAUNCHCOIN at a price of $0.16, currently having a floating profit of $800K.

It is unclear who this whale is and their intentions are, but vigorous buying activity from whales typically anticipates upcoming price surges for low-volume tokens like LAUNCHCOIN. Launch Coin Shows Signs of a Weakening Uptrend Looking at the hourly chart on MEXC, the price of LAUNCHCOIN started to surge rapidly after the 21-day exponential moving average (EMA) crossed above the 200-day EMA last Saturday and has delivered significant gains since then. The rally pushed LAUNCHCOIN from around $0.00558 to its current level at $0.1956. The latest price action shows that the token is retesting a key support that could either result in a break of structure or a strong bounce to new heights. If the price moves below the $0.1750 level, it would confirm what could be the end of this latest uptrend and the beginning of a correction. The key support to watch down the road is the 200-period EMA in the hourly chart. If the price stays above this marker, the short-term outlook for LAUNCHCOIN will continue to be bullish. Can this token get to $1? If the Believe app continues to gain traction as an alternative token minting tool to Pump.fun, the demand for LAUNCHCOIN will likely rise and could push the price to those heights. However, if the hype fades, the token could also experience a significant correction in the next few days. Meme coins are a promising segment of the crypto space that has delivered big gains to early buyers. MIND of Pepe (MIND) has emerged as one of the top meme coin presales of the year and you still have time to invest at its discounted price before the ICO ends. MIND of Pepe (MIND) Leverages the Power of AI and Viral Memes to Launch a Captivating AI Agent MIND of Pepe (MIND) is an AI agent designed to interact with high-profile accounts and regular users across social media platforms like X to progressively build an influence. The agent will engage in conversations about meme coins and the state of the crypto market to capture social trends and emerging opportunities that will be passed on to $MIND holders so they can take advantage of these insights. As its influence grows, MIND of Pepe can also launch its own meme coins to capture new trends. $MIND holders will get early access to these token offerings to reap the highest returns once they are offered to the general public.

QCP: Crypto Outpaces Stocks in Recovery as Bitcoin Nears All-Time High “Crypto has outperformed stocks in the recovery,” QCP wrote, pointing to Bitcoin’s strength in recent sessions. BTC is trading just below record highs amid improving macro conditions and rising market optimism. Ethereum, which lagged behind Bitcoin in the rally, is starting to close the gap. The ETH/BTC ratio rose to 0.025, indicating that Ethereum's performance against Bitcoin has become relatively stronger. QCP believes digital assets still have room to rise even higher, especially with a major milestone on the horizon: Coinbase’s inclusion in the S&P 500 index on May 19. This event is expected to attract billions of passive inflows and increase the visibility of crypto stocks among institutional investors. “The prospect of Coinbase joining the S&P 500 adds fuel to the rally and reinforces crypto’s growing integration into the broader financial system,” QCP said. Market analysts are closely watching the cryptocurrency’s continued decoupling from equities, with BTC and ETH showing resilience amid global market volatility and renewed investor confidence in the digital asset sector. *This is not investment advice.

Grass ( GRASS ) surged to a high of $2.4078, up nearly 70% from its monthly low, bringing its market capitalization to over $578 million. Daily trading volume jumped 215% to $151 million. According to the Grass Foundation , daily data scraped jumped to a record high of 1,762 terabytes, up from this week’s low of 200 terabytes. The previous daily record was 1.745 terabytes in March. Grass utilizes unused internet bandwidth from user devices (or “nodes”) to scrape publicly available data from websites such as Wikipedia and The New York Times. This data is then used to train AI models, offering them access to real-time public information.

Meanwhile, CoinGlass data shows demand for the Grass crypto token has also surged in the futures market, hitting an all-time high of $152 million, driven primarily by activity on Bybit, followed by Binance. Grass crypto price analysis Grass price chart | Source: crypto.news The four-hour chart shows that Grass climbed to $2.3875, its highest price since March 6. It broke above the key resistance level at $2.00, previously the high from April 2. GRASS has also broken out of a green symmetrical triangle, confirming a bullish move. It’s now trading above the 50-period moving average, while the Relative Strength Index has entered overbought territory. Therefore, the most likely scenario is where the Grass crypt coin retreats and retests the psychological point at $2, and then resumes the uptrend. More gains may see it jump to its all-time high of $3.85, up by 70% from the current level. The bullish outlook for Grass Coin will be invalidated if it falls below the psychological level of $1.50, which aligns with the confluence of the two triangle trendlines.

The performance of ETH has improved dramatically in the past month as the token trimmed its yearly losses from nearly 50% to just 22% and has delivered gains of 55.5% in the past month alone. ETH finally getting some traction is a sign that we’re entering the most interesting phase of the cycle. 10K by Q4 seems like a reasonable target if things keeping going this way. — The Crypto Monk (@thecryptomonk) May 13, 2025 The network’s Pectra upgrade, apart from an overall improvement in sentiment, has been responsible for this quick recovery and has improved the market’s baseline Ethereum price forecast . Investors expect that the changes introduced by Pectra can make Ethereum more scalable, cheaper to use, and faster. Along with multiple other changes, Pectra implements automatic ETH burns by using a portion of the network’s gas fees. The result is that ETH may now be a deflationary coin, meaning that its circulating supply will shrink over time. Ethereum Price Prediction: Key Supports and Resistances to Watch The daily chart shows that ETH’s price experienced a significant boost right after Pectra was successfully implemented on the Ethereum mainnet. The move distanced the token significantly from its 21-day exponential moving average (EMA) and was followed by two large green candles that consolidated the rally and pushed ETH above its 200-day EMA. The 200-day EMA is an indicator of the direction of an asset’s long-term trend, when the price rises above it, it confirms a bullish long-term outlook. ETH needs to clear the $3,000 to keep rising. The price has found support at the 200-day EMA in the past few sessions and seems to have entered consolidation mode as market participants gather the necessary liquidity to push it higher. The 21-day EMA is the key support to watch for ETH in case of a pullback along with the $2,100. If the token can stay above those thresholds, even though it may not rise to $10,000 shortly, its upside potential is quite high. As the crypto market recovers, the best crypto presales like Best Wallet (BEST) will attract significant interest from investors as they will likely outperform well-established tokens like ETH in the near term. Best Wallet (BEST) Raises $12M to Launch its Innovative Web 3 Storage Solution Best Wallet (BEST) is a Web 3 crypto wallet that introduces powerful new features that will allow investors to buy and swap tokens with low fees and identify nascent opportunities in the crypto market. The project has created a tool called ‘Upcoming Tokens’ that scans the market to spot the most promising crypto presales like MIND of Pepe (MIND) and BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL). In the past, this feature has identified big winners like Pepe Unchained (PEPU), whose ICO delivered gains of more than 700% to those who bought the token at its discounted presale price. Best Wallet also plans to launch a decentralized exchange and a debit card down the road to strengthen its ecosystem. As the adoption of its Web 3 storage solution grows, the demand for $BEST will rise as the utility token used to settle all transactions. To buy $BEST, simply head to the Best Wallet website and connect your wallet. If you don’t have a crypto wallet, you can download the Best Wallet app and set up one as well.

But Remittix is quickly grabbing investors’ attention with its applicability in real life and growing adoption. As market forces unfold in 2025, these four altcoins are writing very different stories—but just one can potentially emerge as the year’s breakout winner. Let’s dissect the situation as it is. Remittix (RTX): Redefining Crypto Utility in Real-World Adoption Remittix (RTX) is already one of the most sought-after crypto projects for 2025. In raising more than $15 million and selling 535 million+ tokens, the momentum seems unstoppable. For just $0.0757, RTX will be the future of cross-border finance. Its most thrilling aspect? Adding a frictionless crypto-to-fiat on-ramp that allows users to send BTC, ETH, or XRP directly to regular bank accounts in mere minutes. Remittix thus represents a real competitor in the $190 trillion global payment space, ahead of most Layer-1 competitors in daily use. Analysts compare RTX’s journey to early-stage XRP or Stellar (XLM), but fast-tracked. With massive adoption potential and institutional demand building momentum, the majority view is that Remittix will hit the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap in the next cycle. In a speculative market, RTX is the sole project introducing immediate utility and robust investor confidence. Dogecoin: Barking Louder With Fresh Momentum Dogecoin (DOGE) is again in focus after recording a +3.46% spike.

The TVL spiked heavily since the last trading day, while the price is also holding strongly above the gains. This suggests the range around $0.42 to $0.44 has become a strong support range with a potential for a significant pump. The ENA price was at its peak at the start of the year. In the times when the price was expected to rise above the current highs close to $1.5, the price faced an 80% pullback to form lows around $0.255. However, the latest rebound that came after a prolonged consolidation between $0.35 and $0.25 hints towards the resurgence of bullish dominance over the token. Moreover, the token is about to repeat the previous pattern and hence displays the possibility of a 200% rise in the next few months. During the previous breakout, the price formed an inverse head and shoulder pattern and broke above the neckline. Currently, the price has broken above the falling wedge and is experiencing a small retest following the breakout. The MACD shows a rise in the buying volume while the levels have just entered the positive range for the first time since the start of the year. This suggests a major price action could be fast approaching. The price has risen above the 50-day MA ever since Ethena broke above the pattern, suggesting the token has entered a bullish range. With the technicians in place, the price is expected to maintain a healthy ascending trend, forming consecutive higher highs and lows to reach the resistance zone between $0.52 and $0.54. Once the ENA price rises above the range, the possibility of a Golden Cross could be higher. Hence, the Ethena price is displaying huge bullish momentum and is believed to maintain a healthy upswing beyond $1 by the end of Q2, 2025.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|TRADING|ZRX|ENA,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-14 13:52:05

The fund's performance trails Bitcoin and MAXI, but aligns closely with YBTC, indicating typical underperformance of covered call funds in volatile or bull markets. BTCI's use of Bitcoin futures offers capital efficiency, maintaining significant upside potential, which can be seen in its comparison to YBTC. Distributions made by BTCI are largely tax-efficient, and this article discusses why it is suitable for taxable brokerage accounts despite its high income. Introduction In my quest to build the perfect portfolio, I've stumbled across quite a few Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) funds, in particular those that trade options on top of Bitcoin holdings. Most recently, I've reviewed Simplify's MAXI and Roundhill's YBTC . In both reviews, I received the same question from readers: What about the NEOS Bitcoin High Income ETF (BATS: BTCI )? Okay, they don't write the name out like that, but it's all the same. The people want to know if BTCI is worth its salt, especially after I gave green lights to both MAXI and YBTC. Let's take a look at BTCI to see how it stacks up. The fund's investment strategy is fairly straightforward. Like most covered call funds, it buys its reference asset and then systematically sells call options against that long position. This limits the upside of the asset, but provides income. More on that later. We can see how much of BTCI's returns are made through this income by comparing its price returns and total return, which includes dividends paid but not reinvested. Data by YCharts The fund has kept up with Bitcoin over time, although its underperformance to the asset itself is to be expected, as the income produced by BTCI is a direct result of the capped upside. That doesn't make it a bad investment, especially for those that are wanting to use the income and are willing to pay the difference in total return in order to have the income hit their account each month without their intervention or timing of selling shares. Data by YCharts BTCI Strategy Covered call strategies are fairly straightforward, given how complex options strategies can get. The fund buys Bitcoin, which it owns via VanEck's HODL ETF, and then sells Bitcoin futures contracts to generate income. Futures are settled in cash, so the fund doesn't have to sell its Bitcoin if the strike on the call option is breached; they just pay the losses in cash. This is part of why NAV may decline even as Bitcoin rises, and one of the reasons to focus on total return. When looking at BTCI's holdings, we see that it owns HODL as only part of its long exposure. The fund also owns long Bitcoin futures, which act as a source of capital efficiency for the fund. This is because futures often give investors more exposure than they pay for, i.e., leverage. This allows the fund to own less than 25% of its NAV in HODL and less than 10% of its NAV in long Bitcoin futures, and still maintain an upside target of nearly 80% for Bitcoin. Note that the short put, is a long position as well. Combined with the long call, it produces a ""synthetic"" position in Bitcoin, which functions with the same PnL of being long the asset itself. NEOS This combination of assets, and the use of capital-efficient leverage like futures, allows the fund to also hold over 70% of its NAV in T-Bills, which is effectively a cash position. BTCI Performance Against Peers When looking at all three of the funds I've covered up against each other, and against uncovered Bitcoin (measured by IBIT ), limited by BTCI's history as it's the newest fund, we see an interesting pattern emerge. While MAXI has been far more volatile than the other funds, due to its equities-based options overlay, it has actually exceeded Bitcoin's return over this timeframe (which is fairly arbitrary, for the record), while BTCI and YBTC trail behind it. This is par for the course, and we should expect underperformance against the reference asset, Bitcoin, over the long run. Such is par for the course with covered call funds, which will only outperform in sideways markets, and even then, they may still underperform depending on how volatile the asset is. In bull markets, these funds limit their upside exposure with the covered calls and pad their downsides with the income generated from a total return perspective. Data by YCharts MAXI is a bit unfair as a comparison, because it does not cap the upside of Bitcoin, and instead gets its income from its equities and commodities options trading. YBTC is a far closer comparison to BTCI's strategy, given they both directly cap the upside of Bitcoin. BTCI Dividends & Taxes Now, we can get to the main course, the reason most folks are reading this article (I imagine, I suppose I could be wrong on this one): the income. Data by YCharts Its dividend is fairly variable, and really depends on the trading done by management. Expect it to be inconsistent moving forward, as it has been in the past. BTCI doesn't offer the mammoth 55% yield that YBTC does, clocking itself in at a distribution rate of 27%. However, it has outperformed YBTC in total return over its lifespan, which is a great reminder that a higher yield doesn't always mean better results. NEOS Note that I used ""distribution rate"" and not the 30-day SEC yield, which is at a far, far lower 2%. This is because the distributions that BTCI makes are not primarily net investment income (""NII"") or ""ordinary income,"" such as the interest from treasuries (where that 2% comes from to begin with). Instead, as per the IRS rule Section 1256, futures gains are taxed as capital gains. As per Cornell Law School : ... any gain or loss with respect to [futures] shall be treated as... ( A ) short-term capital gain or loss, to the extent of 40 percent of such gain or loss, and ( B ) long-term capital gain or loss, to the extent of 60 percent of such gain or loss, and Because of this rule, distributions made from futures gains inside an ETF are classified as return-of-capital (""RoC""). When looking at BTCI's 19a-1 forms , where the tax classifications for distributions are initially declared (although subject to some later revision, potentially), we see that the vast majority of their distributions are made this way. Here is the latest 19a-1 form from the April distribution: NEOS RoC isn't a bad thing, necessarily. As mentioned earlier, it is an accounting gimmick, more or less. It changes how your taxes are paid. Distributions that include RoC are counted against the cost-basis of your shares, and only create a taxable event when you sell those shares. This means that the income is tax-deferred until the sale of the shares, or until your cost-basis becomes zero. If you get to zero on your cost-basis, new RoC distributions would be considered long-term capital gains, according to this IRS publication . A nondividend distribution reduces the basis of your stock. It is not taxed until your basis in the stock is fully recovered. This nontaxable portion also is called a return of capital; it is a return of your investment in the stock of the company. If you buy stock in a corporation in different lots at different times, and you cannot definitely identify the shares subject to the nondividend distribution, reduce the basis of your earliest purchases first. When the basis of your stock has been reduced to zero, report any additional nondividend distribution you receive as a capital gain. Whether you report it as a long-term or short-term capital gain depends on how long you have held the stock... Example 1. You bought stock in 2010 for $100. In 2013, you received a nondividend distribution of $80. You did not include this amount in your income, but you reduced the basis of your stock to $20. You received a nondividend distribution of $30 in 2023. The first $20 of this amount reduced your basis to zero. You report the other $10 as a long-term capital gain for 2023. You must report as a long-term capital gain any nondividend distribution you receive on this stock in later years. This makes BTCI suitable for taxable brokerage accounts, because its primary income is delivered in this tax-efficient form, which can be cashed in as capital gains at the discretion of the investor (provided your cost basis isn't zero), instead of in the year they are received. Meanwhile, the cash still hits your account and is liquid, despite the taxes on it being put off indefinitely. Suitability Investors need to very carefully consider an allocation to BTCI, as it is a very risky asset to hold long. Bitcoin could plummet, and despite the income generated by the fund, BTCI will get all the same downside. The loss may even be accelerated by the fund's synthetic futures position, which could act against an investor in a sudden crash of the underlying asset. Aggressive investors could consider up to a 3% allocation to BTCI, but should be aware that it is very volatile and only useful for speculation. If an investor has other cryptocurrency exposure, they are advised to lower that allocation to 2% or under. Moderate investors could consider up to a 1% allocation to the fund, and should be aware that they are on the cusp of being intolerable of the kind of risk that cryptocurrency brings to a portfolio. Capping the upside to produce income is a solid strategy for these folks, but the downside they could see if still hefty. Conservative investors should not only avoid BTCI entirely, but Bitcoin itself too. Cryptocurrencies, and funds that sell options against them, are unsuitable for conservative investors entirely. Those investors looking for high volatility income are likely better off with risk-on equities income funds like J PMorgan's JEPQ . Conclusion I am a fan of tax-efficient income funds like the NEOS Bitcoin High Income ETF ( BTCI ) because of its ability to capture some of the upside in Bitcoin, but also provide a tax-efficient way to access the income from its volatility. Of course, risks around underperforming uncapped Bitcoin and still receiving all the downside (less the income received) are worth pausing and considering your own risk tolerance. While the fund receives a buy from me, this is because I see it is a better option than Roundhill's YBTC, which distributes a much higher amount and in return has offered a lower total return, since it misses out on too much of Bitcoin's upside. That being said, my favorite Bitcoin fund is still Simplify's MAXI , as it produces similar amounts of income to BTCI without directly capping the upside of its Bitcoin exposure. That fund is riskier than BTCI, but folks interested in Bitcoin covered call funds are likely to have the risk tolerance for either fund, and could consider even holding both if they have the portfolio space for speculative positions like cryptocurrency. The most important thing to remember is a phrase I've been leaving at the end of a lot of my articles recently, mostly because I think folks need to keep hearing it: Position sizing is often more important than security selection.

33767162,[object Object],1747231205,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Bitcoin To Replace US Dollar In ‘10 Years,’ Says Legendary Investor",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-replace-us-dollar-in-10-years/,"Tim Draper, the legendary BTC investor and venture capitalist who famously bought almost 30,000 BTC for roughly $19 million at a 2014 US Marshals Service auction, believes the world will abandon the greenback for Bitcoin within a decade. Speaking in a wide-ranging podcast interview released this week, the Draper Associates founder argued that software-based money is “better technology” than government-issued currency and predicted a tipping point as early as 2035. Bitcoin Vs. The US-Dollar “The ballpark estimate of how long—when Bitcoin will replace the dollar—[is] ten years, something like that, maybe a little less,” Draper told interviewer Christine Lee. He insisted that a “moment” will arrive when trust in banks and sovereign issuers falters and consumers seek a non-inflationary alternative. “People will move to the Bitcoin standard,” he said, adding that banks’ newly formalised ability to custody digital assets will smooth the transition because customers will be able to shift deposits “pretty quickly online” instead of queueing for physical cash. Draper’s conviction rests on two pillars he has reiterated for years: Bitcoin’s fixed supply and the inevitability of global, permissionless commerce. With approximately 19.86 million BTC already in circulation—95% of the 21 million-coin cap—he contends that fiat currencies are structurally prone to debasement. The veteran investor, whose early-stage bets include Hotmail, Skype, Tesla and SpaceX, likened today’s inflationary environment to the Confederate currency collapse described by his father decades ago: “Nobody wanted Confederate money… it wasn’t valuable anymore because the Union won the war.” Regulatory tail-winds are bolstering his thesis. The US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency first confirmed in 2020 that nationally chartered banks may provide crypto-asset custody services, and last week the agency reiterated that position in an updated interpretive letter, emphasising that such activity is permissible if conducted “in a safe and sound manner.” Draper cited those rulings to argue that the banking sector is “now a bridge” between legacy money and Bitcoin. The market appears to be rewarding that narrative: Bitcoin is trading just above $103,500, capitalising the network at roughly $2 trillion on renewed institutional demand via spot-ETFs . Draper reiterated his long-standing forecast that BTC will reach $250,000 by year-end 2025, but he now frames that target as a waypoint. “You go out ten years and the answer is infinity against the dollar, because there won’t be a dollar,” he said, arguing that once taxes, payroll and everyday purchases can be settled natively on-chain “there won’t be any reason to hold on to dollars.” Draper acknowledged that dollar-pegged stablecoins will remain relevant but called them “a bridge to Bitcoin” that still inherit the political and inflation risk of their reserve currencies. In his view, governments themselves will eventually become node operators and treasury holders because “it’s a better way to collect taxes.” Sceptics point out that reserve-currency status is historically sticky and that US influence is backed by both political power and the world’s deepest capital markets. Draper, however, dismissed doomsday fears about technological disruption, paraphrasing Teddy Roosevelt: credit accrues to “the man or woman in the arena.” He urged companies to keep enough BTC on the balance sheet to cover payroll in a banking crisis and said households that fail to hold at least six months of living expenses in Bitcoin are “being irresponsible.” At press time, BTC traded at $103,747.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|tim draper,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-05-14 14:00:05

They’ve held onto the belief that the upward trend is still intact. Bullish Funding Rate Signals Funding rates have stayed in positive territory, which shows futures traders are mostly long. Data from Coinglass on May 13, 2025, puts rates at 0.0100% on BitMEX, HTX, Gate.io and Bitget. Binance and OKX are a bit lower, at 0.0036% and 0.0034%. Those numbers mean long holders pay short sellers a small fee. That setup can boost a rally. But if the price drops, it can turn costly for those same traders. Support Level Under Watch Market analyst Rekt Capital pointed out that Dogecoin closed above its old pre‑halving resistance on the weekly chart. That level now sits near $0.22 and is acting as support. If DOGE holds that spot, the coin might head toward at least $0.27 next. A failure to stay above $0.22 could shake out some of the most stretched positions. Related Reading: Avalanche Rumbles 21% Amid Record-Breaking Address Activity Overall, the mix of rising futures activity and a soft pullback makes for a tense scene. On one hand, there’s still a strong bullish bias. On the other, too much one‑sided positioning can invite a shakeout. Traders will be watching weekly closes around $0.22 to see if support holds. If it does, a run at $0.27 could happen. If it doesn’t, shorts may gain the upper hand and push prices lower. Either way, volatility is likely to stay high as Dogecoin’s roller‑coaster ride continues.

Traders Bet Big on PNUT & Unilabs as Best Altcoins of 2025",https://thecoinrise.com/goodbye-trump-coin-traders-bet-big-on-pnut-unilabs-as-best-altcoins-of-2025/,"With the announcement of the US and China trade deal and bullish sentiment spreading across the market, most crypto enthusiasts are contemplating their next move. While the hype around meme coins like Trump Coin is fading, a new wave of altcoins has captured attention. The spotlight isn’t just on PNUT; projects like Unilabs (UNIL) have generated buzz for their real-world use case and initial growth potential. Interestingly, the project will combine decentralized asset management with artificial intelligence, positioning itself as a game changer in the crypto landscape. While crypto investors anticipate the next big leap, the best altcoin to buy now might not be as obvious. Trump Coin Price Prediction: 15% Rally Incoming? TRUMP’s bullish setup is gaining momentum following the broader market sentiments. The meme coin’s technical indicators highlight a spike after prolonged bearishness. The Trump Coin had plunged below 30 earlier in the week. However, it has risen as high as 80, indicating strong buying pressure. Source: TradingView Meanwhile, Trump Coin’s 30-day average has also risen above its 200-day average. Typically, this suggests that the meme coin could have entered a growth spurt phase. TRUMP whales are taking this opportunity on the token’s move to dump large quantities of the coin. However, market insiders still believe that the Trump Coin will continue to see steady growth. For starters, the market has started recovering from April’s dip, with the arrival of the US-China trade deal that could potentially spike up momentum. Moreover, the Trump Coin could benefit from President Donald Trump’s influence. He recently announced that he will hold a private dinner open to the token’s 220 largest holders. As such, Trump could reach $17.50 by the end of the month, $30 by the end of July, and $100 by the end of the year. PNUT Price Gains Momentum While the Trump Coin appears steady on charts, PNUT overshadows its momentum. The meme coin has been accumulating gains that have steered it to a weekend high of $0.46. The renewed interest in the token can be attributed to a surge in investor interest in meme coins. Source: TradingView Based on its daily metrics, PNUT price has remained strongly bullish, rising above its 50-day and 100-day EMAs. Meanwhile, its MACD indicator aligns with the strong bullish setup. Notably, the MACD line has risen above the signal line and expanded the green histogram above the center line. PNUT’s relative strength index has hovered above 70, suggesting overbought conditions. This would further suggest an impending pullback on the works, with PNUT likely to reduce value towards the 100-day EMA at $0.29 in search of liquidity and support. Why Unilabs (UNIL) is the Best Crypto To Buy Now While TRUMP and PNUT remain strong contenders, most investors are turning to early-stage projects like Unilabs (UNIL) with exponential growth capabilities. Unilabs is revolutionizing the future of investing through its unique blend of artificial intelligence and decentralized asset management. Ideally, Unilabs will continuously scan the crypto universe to identify high-potential projects with the help of its proprietary artificial intelligence engine. The platform will evaluate emerging projects against a rigorous, data-backed checklist to find high-potential opportunities for investors, which could otherwise go unnoticed. Through this approach, investors will be able to make informed decisions while at the same time balancing their portfolio based on real-time market shifts. Its specialized investment funds ―AI Fund target projects that might revolutionize AI, including AI-driven dApps and machine learning. Meanwhile, the BTC Fund will focus on tokenizing valuable resources and real-world assets, whereas the RWA Fund will enable investors to invest in transformative Web3, DeFi, and blockchain technologies. As interest grows, market insiders anticipate UNIL breaking into the top 50 crypto by 2025, primarily as regulatory tides favor projects built for real-world use. Trump Coin Eyes $30 but UNIL Might Bring Returns First Trump Coin and PNUT price prediction narratives remain strong, with technical indicators suggesting increased buying interest. But investors looking for life-changing gains are turning to Unilabs, a project with higher potential growth. With a low entry price of $0.004 and fast token adoption, Unilabs is among the best projects to watch in 2025. Join The Movement: Buy Presale Website Telegram The post Goodbye, Trump Coin!

Neutral Funding Rates and absorbed sell pressure suggest bulls may be quietly building for a sustained rally. Ripple [XRP] showed signs of renewed bullish momentum, supported by a surge in leveraged positions and strong technical structure. Binance futures data revealed that aggressive sell pressure is being steadily absorbed, hinting at quiet accumulation beneath the surface. Meanwhile, XRP Open Interest (OI) has rebounded sharply, and Funding Rates (FR) remain neutral, indicating balanced sentiment despite growing speculation. This combination sets the stage for a potential sustained rally if key support levels continue to hold. XRP Open Interest climbs sharply as conviction returns Futures OI on XRP surged by over $1 billion in the last week, rising from $2.42 billion to $3.42 billion — a 41.6% increase. This aggressive spike reflects renewed directional conviction, as it coincided with a price rebound from $2.14 to $2.48. Naturally, this reflects growing directional conviction. However, when OI rises without a spike in FR, the risk of overcrowded longs increases. Still, at this stage, traders appear to be positioning for sustained upside. Source: Glassnode Breakout confirmed, but can bulls maintain momentum? XRP has broken out of a descending channel that had capped price action since March. The altcoin was holding above the crucial $2.38 level, which previously acted as resistance and now serves as support. Fibonacci projections identify $2.82, $3.01, and $3.38 as the next upside targets if bulls maintain control. However, the Stochastic RSI is currently hovering above 98, suggesting overbought conditions. Therefore, a short-term retracement could occur if momentum stalls. Despite this risk, the absence of any major resistance clusters ahead provides bulls with an open path. The structure remains bullish as long as XRP stays above $2.38. Failure to hold this level could invite renewed selling pressure and invalidate the breakout. Traders should therefore watch price behavior around this zone closely, especially in relation to leverage activity. Source: TradingView Funding Rate signals indecision beneath the surface Despite the leverage surge, XRP’s OI-weighted FR stood at +0.0128%. That neutrality implies no lopsided positioning just yet. Therefore, the market remains in a delicate balance — one where aggressive longs could still face a squeeze if sentiment flips. On the other hand, neutral funding also allows room for healthy continuation, as excessively long bias has not yet formed. Source: CoinGlass Will XRP hold $2.38 and push higher? Ripple’s technical breakout and sharp rise in OI reflect growing trader conviction and bullish momentum. The move above $2.38 marks a critical shift in market structure, and holding this level is key to sustaining the rally. However, the Stochastic RSI remained in overbought territory, and FR are still neutral, signaling a potential tug-of-war between bulls and bears. If buyers continue to absorb selling pressure and maintain control above support, a push toward $3.00 becomes increasingly likely.",Altcoin|News|News 1|Ripple|Social|Trading View|ambcrypto,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|BNB,"{'name': 'AMB Crypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/ambcrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",ambcrypto,2025-05-14 14:00:54

Unstaked vs GRT, AGIX, and FET, Who’s Going to Win The Game?",https://thecoinrise.com/best-ai-bet-in-top-crypto-coins-unstaked-vs-grt-agix-and-fet-whos-going-to-win-the-game/,"Meme coins are starting to lose their grip, and real-world use is now the main focus. Crypto buyers today are leaning into platforms that solve actual problems, especially those tied to automation and AI. That’s why top crypto coins in 2025 include projects offering tech that does more than ride trends, it builds the future of Web3. AI coins with working features are leading this shift. From smart agent networks to automated platforms, these tokens are drawing major attention. And one name that stands out for its fast growth and working plan is Unstaked, which could realistically touch $3 soon. Here’s a roundup of the top crypto coins reshaping AI in Web3, and why Unstaked is stealing the show. 1. Unstaked (UNSD): AI Agents, 24x ROI, and Growing Buzz Unstaked is quickly becoming the go-to project for those who want real AI-driven automation. It’s not just a theme, it’s a working system built around smart agents that will go live after the launch. These agents will manage online groups across platforms like Telegram and X, making decisions, responding to activity, and building real communities 24/7. What makes them special? Every task is recorded on-chain. Engagement is rewarded based on activity you can verify. This creates a rare combo of automation and trust. These Unstaked ($WAI) agents aren’t scripts; they learn and adapt in real time. Unstaked has now raised over $6 million in presale funding and is in Stage 12. Tokens are priced at $0.008997, and over 25.98 million tokens have been sold. With a planned launch price of $0.1819, there’s a real shot at 24x returns. Some analysts are even pointing to a $3 target based on demand and real utility, not just hype. Its structure appeals to early users who want to be part of something that scales. Once the AI agents go live post-launch, this platform will offer tools no other AI crypto project has. While many talk, Unstaked is building. It’s why many now consider it one of the top crypto coins to enter early. 2. The Graph (GRT): Powering On-Chain Data for AI The Graph is one of the few projects giving AI access to blockchain data in a smart, fast way. Its indexing protocol helps apps pull real-time data from blockchains, something AI systems need to work right. GRT isn’t about agents or chatbots. But it plays a big role in making other top crypto coins functional in AI ecosystems. Its tools are used by many dApps, DeFi builders, and developers who need data to train, predict, and automate. The Graph holds its place by being reliable and widely used. It’s not flashy, but it is necessary. As AI expands across crypto, GRT remains key for data-powered performance. 3. SingularityNET (AGIX): A Marketplace for AI Tools SingularityNET lets developers share and sell AI services on a decentralized network. From decision bots to AI engines, the platform allows creators to list tools and get paid in AGIX, its native token. It supports developers with tools to launch quickly without needing big tech firms. This open marketplace idea is why AGIX stays on the list of top crypto coins built for the AI age. Even though AGIX has seen price swings, it stays strong thanks to its role in sharing AI services fairly and openly. It’s still one of the better bets in this space. 4. Fetch.ai (FET): Agents Built for Real-World Tasks Fetch.ai also works with AI agents, but focuses on industrial use. These agents manage tasks like logistics, delivery, and even energy trades. This gives FET a unique place in the top crypto coins space, especially in supply chains and automation sectors. It’s less people-focused than Unstaked, but Fetch.ai is strong on the backend. Its agents learn, work in groups, and help systems act fast without human input. FET tokens run the network and cover transaction costs. While it doesn’t center on communities, Fetch.ai is still key in building out AI in crypto, just from a more enterprise angle. Final Word The market is waking up to the fact that hype won’t last, but tools will. That’s why Unstaked is being seen as one of the top crypto coins with actual staying power. It raised $6 million already, with smart agents set to launch right after the presale. It’s not just funding, it’s a full framework. Proof of work, verified activity, no VC control, and clear use all set it apart. Others like GRT, AGIX, and FET have their roles, but none offer the full package like Unstaked. If 2025 is about performance, use, and future-proof automation, Unstaked checks every box. That’s why it’s now leading the race among the top crypto coins built for AI growth.

44612647,https://timestabloid.com/?p=67210,1747231339,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Ripple CEO: XRP Moves Value In Seconds,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-ceo-xrp-moves-value-in-seconds/,"In a video clip recently shared by Rowen Exchange on X, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse emphasized the revolutionary capabilities of XRP in facilitating fast and efficient cross-border transactions. According to Garlinghouse, XRP’s primary advantage lies in its ability to move value in seconds, a feat that distinguishes it from other digital assets like Bitcoin. This speed and scalability offer a practical solution to a real-world problem, positioning XRP as a superior option for financial institutions. XRP: Real-Time Value Transfer Garlinghouse highlighted that while XRP, like Bitcoin, is a digital asset, its utility goes far beyond mere speculative trading. Unlike Bitcoin, which can take up to 12 minutes to complete a transaction, XRP achieves this in just three seconds. This remarkable speed is crucial in the financial sector, where efficiency and real-time value transfer are paramount. Brad Garlinghouse: ""XRP moves value in seconds"" pic.twitter.com/1eojAoATuY — Rowen Exchange (@RowenExchange) May 14, 2025 What sets XRP apart is its focus on liquidity management for banks. Instead of prefunding accounts—a costly and cumbersome process—banks can simply access XRP liquidity denominated in USD, pounds, or other major currencies. This system allows for real-time movement of value, reducing the need for pre-funded accounts and streamlining international transactions. Bridging the Gap Between Banks Ripple’s primary goal is to facilitate transactions between banks, providing an alternative to the traditional, slower methods that dominate the industry. XRP’s unique approach enables banks to eliminate the need for holding reserves in multiple countries, thereby freeing up capital and increasing operational efficiency. This process not only reduces transaction times but also cuts costs significantly, offering a superior product at a more competitive price. Garlinghouse’s remarks underscore a critical difference between XRP and other digital assets. While Bitcoin’s longer transaction times make it less practical for real-time financial operations, XRP’s instantaneous processing makes it highly scalable and suited for institutional use. The result is a consumer experience marked by faster and cheaper transactions—an outcome that resonates well with the needs of modern banking.

Ripple’s technology addresses long-standing pain points within the financial sector, such as delayed settlements and high fees. By enabling instantaneous transactions, XRP directly solves a tangible problem, making it an attractive option for banks and financial institutions worldwide. This focus on real-world application distinguishes XRP from other digital assets that primarily serve as investment vehicles. Ripple’s commitment to solving practical problems has positioned XRP not only as a cryptocurrency but as a financial tool capable of transforming the traditional banking model. The Future of Real-Time Payments As financial institutions continue to explore blockchain solutions, Ripple’s emphasis on speed, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness positions XRP as a leading contender for cross-border payment solutions. Garlinghouse’s vision reflects a broader industry trend towards faster and more transparent transactions. With banks increasingly recognizing the value of on-demand liquidity, XRP’s adoption is poised to grow. In conclusion, XRP’s ability to move value in seconds highlights its practical utility and sets it apart from slower alternatives like Bitcoin. As Ripple continues to build partnerships and expand its network, the demand for such fast and scalable solutions is likely to increase. XRP not only exemplifies technological innovation but also addresses a fundamental need in global finance—real-time, low-cost transactions.

Meanwhile, Senators Cynthia Lummis and Bernie Moreno are pushing the Treasury Department to revise corporate crypto tax rules, and warned that taxing unrealized gains on digital assets harms US competitiveness. Also in the US, Sam Altman’s Worldcoin project is facing more backlash over privacy concerns as it rolls out iris-scanning verification hubs in the country. The patchwork of state biometric laws is also making things more difficult for the project to gain traction. Gensler Accused of Playing Politics on Crypto Former US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler may have had a much more favorable view of crypto in private than his public actions suggested. This is according to former US Representative Patrick McHenry. On the Crypto in America podcast on May 13, McHenry recounted some of his private interactions with Gensler, and revealed that the former SEC chair expressed a nuanced understanding of digital assets behind closed doors. “Did he come across, or was he as anti-crypto in private as he was in public?” McHenry was asked. “No… Nope,” he responded, adding that Gensler “saw the value of digital assets” and acknowledged the promise of blockchain technology, particularly during his academic tenure at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Former US Representative Patrick McHenry Gerald Gallagher, general counsel at Sei Labs, supported this view by pointing out Gensler’s lesser-known academic contributions, including his involvement in shaping the concept of the airdrop. Despite these insights, McHenry said he was dismayed by the shift in Gensler’s posture once he assumed leadership at the SEC in 2021. During his tenure, Gensler spearheaded more than 100 enforcement actions against crypto companies, which is a strategy that drew widespread criticism from industry leaders and politicians. McHenry described discussions with Gensler as perplexing, and said that while conversations would begin constructively, they would often descend into contradictions. He suggested Gensler’s hardline public stance may have been driven more by Senate confirmation dynamics than personal conviction. Gensler officially left the SEC on Jan. 20, 2025, after which he returned to MIT to teach courses on fintech and AI. Unfortunately, his time at the SEC left a trail of industry resentment. In late 2024, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong announced the company would cut ties with law firms employing former SEC officials who participated in what he described as a campaign to “unlawfully kill” the crypto industry. Similarly, in early 2025, Gemini declared that it would no longer hire MIT graduates unless the institution severed ties with Gensler. Senators Push Treasury for Crypto Tax Relief While Gensler’s actual stance on crypto is still unclear, other lawmakers are making their voices heard. Two US senators urged the Treasury Department to revise how corporate taxes apply to digital assets. They believe this move is necessary to preserve America's competitive edge in the digital finance space. In a letter dated May 12, Senators Cynthia Lummis and Bernie Moreno called on Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to amend the definition of “adjusted financial statement income” under current law. Their proposal seeks to ease the tax burden that is imposed by the Inflation Reduction Act, which levies a 15% minimum tax on corporations earning over $1 billion in profits for three consecutive years. Under the current framework, companies could be taxed on unrealized gains from crypto holdings, which is a prospect that Lummis and Moreno argue puts US firms at a disadvantage compared to their international peers. Lummis is a longtime advocate for digital asset innovation, and she placed a lot of emphasis on the importance of quick action in a May 13 social media post. She warned that failure to adapt could threaten the nation’s leadership in digital finance. (Source: Follow the Crypto) Moreno is a freshman senator whose campaign was supported by crypto-aligned political action committees, and had similar concerns in the letter. Both senators argued that modifying the tax code could provide much-needed relief to corporations investing in digital assets. This initiative comes amid wider legislative efforts related to crypto, including renewed attempts to pass the GENIUS Act — which is a bill that is aimed at creating a regulatory framework for payment stablecoins. A May 8 motion to consider the bill in the Senate stalled after Democrats objected to former President Donald Trump's connections to the crypto industry. Despite the setback, Lummis indicated that she will continue to support advancing digital asset regulation and suggested the Senate could revisit the stablecoin bill vote. Worldcoin Raises Alarms in US Privacy Debate Meanwhile, regulators are more uncertain about World Network, the digital identity and crypto project launched by Sam Altman’s OpenAI. It is facing mounting global criticism and regulatory scrutiny as it prepares for its launch in the United States. Formerly known as Worldcoin, the initiative uses iris-scanning technology to create a unique digital identity for users, which the company claims will help distinguish humans from AI in an increasingly automated world. However, privacy advocates argue that the project poses a serious threat to personal freedom and security, and warned that biometric data collected could be used for profiling, surveillance, and discrimination. Despite its promise of privacy protection, World has already been banned in countries like Spain, Brazil, and Hong Kong, while authorities in India, South Korea, Kenya , Germany, and others have launched investigations or ordered the deletion of user data. Critics claim the project offers insufficient transparency, targets vulnerable populations, and fails to offer clear consent withdrawal mechanisms. Additionally, Privacy International and Amnesty International both warned that without strict legal frameworks and oversight, biometric data collection initiatives like World risk enabling mass surveillance and eugenics-based profiling. World now plans to expand into the US and establish verification hubs in Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, and San Francisco, where users can scan their irises to obtain digital IDs. Yet the project faces a very complex patchwork of biometric privacy laws that vary a lot between states. World’s orbs Only California and Texas currently have state-level protections for biometric data, and enforcement in Texas is limited to the attorney general’s discretion. Legal experts warn that users in states without these kinds of protections are particularly vulnerable, as there is no federal law specifically governing the collection of biometric data like iris scans. Cyberlaw attorney Andrew Rossow explained that user protections depend heavily on the willingness and capacity of local authorities to act, which may vary widely. While Ethereum community figures like Tomasz Stańczak and Paul Dylan-Ennis have voiced cautious optimism about World’s privacy protocols, others are still deeply skeptical.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|WLD,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-14 14:02:36

Fed Rate Bets and Dollar Weakness Add Momentum; Bitcoin Gains Adding to the bullish tilt is a growing belief that the U.S. Federal Reserve could cut rates sooner than expected. Following a lower-than-forecast Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, analysts now project the first rate cut as early as July, or more conservatively, by September. US inflation came in softer than forecast for a third straight month in April with the consumer price index increasing 0.2% from March. The core CPI rose 2.8%, compared with April of last year.

BTC Bull Token Crosses $5.70M as 73% Staking Yield Captivates Crypto Investors BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) continues to attract strong investor interest, now surpassing $5.70 million in funds raised as it approaches its $6.69 million presale cap. With its current price holding at $0.00251, BTCBULL is positioning itself as a high-yield staking solution rather than just another meme coin, delivering tangible utility amid rising market volatility. Flexible Staking Model Offers 73% APY, No Lockups What sets BTCBULL apart is its flexible staking architecture, offering investors an estimated 73% annual yield—with no lockup periods or exit penalties. In an environment where most DeFi staking protocols require long-term commitments, BTCBULL’s model allows participants to earn rewards while maintaining liquidity, appealing to both cautious and active crypto traders. This agility has resonated with yield-seeking investors looking to participate in the 2025 crypto cycle without being bound by rigid staking conditions.

As XRP continues to show strong potential, a new challenger, Remittix , is emerging as an “XRP 2.0” rival. With a predicted 12,000% surge, Remittix’s innovative cross-border payment solution could disrupt the market. Want to know if XRP could reach $5 and why Remittix might outpace it? Read on to discover why Remittix is the next big thing in crypto. UNLOCKING! Remittix A 2025 MUST-HAVE! Can XRP reach $5? Price prediction and future outlook One of the best-performing cryptocurrencies since the bull resurgence is XRP; many experts believe its price might surge above $5. The latest market movement and strong positive signals indicate a possible advance, particularly following a breakout above important resistance levels. After its lowest moments, XRP’s price has been gradually rising, with some projections indicating that, given the correct momentum, the coin might even reach a new all-time high. The rising user base and institutional support the cryptocurrency receives strengthen its future. Another advantage that might provide XRP with long-term stability is concluding its legal battle with the SEC. Source: TradingView Although this is contingent on various elements, including market sentiment, regulatory clarity, and rising acceptance of XRP in real-world use cases, the present trend demonstrates growing confidence from investors, making the $5 aim realistic. The big question is, when is this $5 achievable? Remittix as XRP 2.0: The rival with a possible 12,000% increase Although XRP is still strong, a fresh rival, Remittix, is already being referred to as “XRP 2.0” because of their similarities in key product features. With its creative PayFi system, Remittix seeks to change cross-border transactions. Customers can send money from their crypto wallets to bank accounts without any knowledge of cryptocurrencies. The Remittix token RTX is attracting interest because of its potential. Based on its presale performance, with more than 75% of the total token supply sold, analysts estimate RTX might witness a huge 12,000% increase in the next years. Remittix has generated almost $15 million in presale and might see its value increase as more people and companies choose crypto-to-fiat solutions. Some analysts even think it may eventually outperform XRP. Designed for simple crypto-to-fiat transactions, the Remittix platform might become the preferred method for cross-border payments. Its meteoric surge will help establish Remittix as a fierce rival of XRP in the crypto market. EYES ON THE PRIZE! Remittix THIS CRYPTO IS ON THE PATH TO BLUE CHIP GLORY! XRP vs XRP 2.0: How do they compare? Though their methods differ, XRP and Remittix both operate in the business of enabling quick and cheap cross-border payments. With a sizable market capitalization and past usage in financial institutions, XRP is already well-known. The major benefits of XRP are high liquidity, a great network, and general acceptance. Though being in its early years, Remittix offers something fresh and interesting. The Remittix PayFi technology is special since it lets anyone use crypto for international transactions regardless of their level of expertise in cryptocurrencies. This ease of usage could make Remittix particularly attractive to a broader audience, especially those unfamiliar with crypto. While XRP has experienced a consistent increase, Remittix is positioned for explosive development. Though Remittix’s creative strategy may help it to eventually grab a bigger market share, XRP’s maturity compared with Remittix’s potential for a huge spike indicates both projects could flourish. Finally, supported by rising institutional interest and increased adoption, analysts estimate that XRP and Remittix have a bright future and might rise above $5. However, Remittix is an emerging competitor that might just outshine XRP in the coming years. With its innovative cross-border payment system and the explosive growth potential of RTX, Remittix could be the new force in the crypto market. Early involvement with Remittix, particularly during its presale phase, should be taken into consideration by investors since it’s providing returns beyond XRP’s present potential. Available for $0.0757, don’t miss the opportunity to participate in the next major cryptocurrency event, Remittix.

XRP’s breakout fizzles as Remittix enters the PayFi arena, sparking talk of 400x returns and threatening to outpace Ripple’s decade-long mission. Table of Contents XRP: A day late and a dollar short? Remittix: Global payments made easy Conclusion XRP has just shattered its recent wedge pattern, igniting fresh excitement across the crypto space. This classic chart move could be the signal bulls have been waiting for, and if momentum holds, XRP might be gearing up for its next major rally. Traders are watching closely to see if this breakout has real legs, but the long-term outlook for XRP is not as assured as some would like. The breakout was fueled by the SEC and Ripple Labs finally coming to a settlement, but it seems the breakout was the peak of XRP this cycle. The bad news for XRP is there’s a new PayFi player in town, and it may just kick XRP’s knees out from under it. Remittix is already rumored to go up 400x, but looking at its use case, 400% may be on the low side. Let’s see how Remittix stacks up against XRP. Source: Coingecko XRP: A day late and a dollar short? There is no doubt XRP’s vision and mission fill a gap in the market, it’s just that XRP has not gotten there yet. Global payment systems are still stuck in the middle of the previous century, and with global communications being cheap and instant, there’s no need for global payments to take so long or be so expensive. Ripple Labs created XRP exactly to solve this problem, but since 2013, it has not managed to get there. XRP has been sitting in a holding pattern with the SEC court case looming, but this has not come to a head, and in the resolution, XRP has gone up 11% and broken out of a wedge pattern, a bullish signal. But some predictions are not as bullish as XRP investors would like them to be. Coincodex sees a very flat few years ahead, with only a spike during the 2029 halving cycle giving XRP investors some respite before XRP closes off the decade at lower than present levels. It could be that XRP’s race is run, and the baton has been taken by the new PayFi token Remittix.

Remittix uses blockchain tech for global payments, so users can use cryptocurrency to make direct payments into almost any fiat bank account across the globe. This makes global payments much more efficient and cost-effective, which has a massive impact on businesses in the bottom line and service delivery. But the world’s 1.4 billion unbanked people stand to gain the most out of Remittix. The unbanked can not partake in the formal economy, but Remittix gives users the capacity to uplift themselves and build wealth in environments where working within the formal banking system is just not possible. This is a major advantage Remittix holds over competitors like XRP, and the investment potential here is enormous. Some analysts are claiming Remittix could reach 400% gains, this figure is a short-term low-ball figure, and in the long term, Remittix can perform much better. Conclusion Remittix has finally solved the global payments issue, leaving XRP on the sidelines. From an investing point of view, it is clear that XRP is not nearly as great a project as it once was. While it is easy to blame the SEC for this, the reality of the situation is that Remittix has come along and spoiled XRP’s party. Even YouTube agrees Remittix is the new token to watch. Remittix is now available at $0.757 directly from their website. To learn more about Remittix, visit the website and socials.

Known for accurately predicting XRP’s rally to $0.5, Crypto Michael now foresees a second parabolic rally once the digital asset breaks the $3 mark. While his previous prediction was met with skepticism, his new forecast has sparked a renewed debate among crypto enthusiasts. Crypto Michael’s initial prediction of XRP reaching $0.5 was widely dismissed as overly optimistic. At the time, market sentiment surrounding XRP was bearish, partly influenced by the ongoing legal challenges between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Despite the doubts, XRP eventually surged to the predicted level, validating Michael’s analysis and earning him a reputation for his bold yet accurate forecasts. When I predicted the XRP rally at $0.5 Everyone called me crazy. I am now predicting a second parabolic rally once XRP breaks $3. They are calling me crazy again. Doubt me at your own risk. https://t.co/D4dWE6powa — Crypto Michael (@MichaelXBT) May 13, 2025 The New Target: A Parabolic Rally Beyond $3 Building on his previous success, Crypto Michael has now set his sights on a much higher target. According to his latest prediction, XRP is poised for a significant parabolic rally once it surpasses the critical $3 threshold. While this projection has again drawn skepticism, Michael remains confident, urging those who doubt him to do so at their own risk. The premise of his prediction lies in the anticipated market dynamics following a decisive breakout above $3. Historically, XRP has demonstrated rapid upward movements following periods of prolonged consolidation. Michael believes that breaking this psychological resistance could catalyze an influx of trading volume, pushing prices into a new bullish phase. Market Sentiment and Analyst Reactions Reactions to Crypto Michael’s prediction have been mixed. Some traders view his analysis as overly ambitious, especially given XRP’s current price levels and market conditions. However, others point to his track record, noting that his previous $0.5 call was similarly dismissed before being proven accurate. Market analysts also consider broader factors influencing XRP’s price trajectory, including ongoing developments in the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit and the growing utility of XRP in cross-border payments. Should regulatory clarity emerge, it could further fuel the bullish narrative that Michael envisions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Factors Supporting a Bullish Case Several key factors could support XRP’s potential rally to $3 and beyond. Firstly, the resolution of legal uncertainties around XRP could eliminate a major barrier to broader adoption. Additionally, increasing integration of XRP in payment solutions, particularly through Ripple’s partnerships, could enhance demand. Moreover, market sentiment in the crypto space often plays a significant role. Should XRP break the $3 mark, it could trigger a psychological shift among traders, leading to increased buy pressure and momentum-driven price action . Crypto Michael’s forecast aligns with the view that such a breakout could mark the beginning of a parabolic upward trend. Remaining Cautious: Market Volatility While Crypto Michael’s prediction has garnered attention, investors need to approach such forecasts with caution. The cryptocurrency market is inherently volatile, and past accuracy does not guarantee future success. Those considering trading based on this prediction should conduct thorough research and risk assessment. A Bold Prediction Amid Market Uncertainty Crypto Michael’s new prediction of an XRP rally beyond $3 has undoubtedly stirred discussions within the crypto community. His unwavering confidence, bolstered by past success, makes his forecast intriguing. However, as the market awaits clearer signals, traders and investors must weigh optimism against caution. Whether or not XRP achieves this milestone, the unfolding narrative will continue to capture the attention of both skeptics and supporters alike.

Bitcoin holders time share. Source: IntoTheBlock This long-term commitment has likely played a key role in the notable profit share, as early investors capture the most substantial price appreciation over time. Indeed, the almost 100% profitability suggests that most holders entered their positions at significantly lower prices, often accumulating during bear markets or earlier cycles when Bitcoin traded below $50,000, such as in early 2024. Notably, the widespread positive returns have also been reinforced by a wave of price momentum, largely fueled by post-election optimism following President Donald Trump’s victory. Since the November 2024 polls, Bitcoin has remained within the $90,000 to $105,000 range, providing a cushion for even recent buyers. Many of these buyers have remained profitable or at breakeven despite the minor pullback from the all-time high of over $109,000, reached earlier this year.

Now at $2.1 billion in TVL, bulls are eyeing a breakout toward the $5 Gartley target despite overbought indicators.

Liquidity providers earn trading fees and may also receive $RAY tokens or other incentives, depending on the pool. Additionally, users can stake $RAY to earn more of the same token. As Solana’s top DEX by volume, Raydium averaged daily trading volumes of $3.6 billion in Q1 2025. This growth was largely driven by a record-breaking $195.8 billion monthly volume in January, which peaked at $16 billion on Jan. 19, fueled by the frenzy around Trump’s TRUMP memecoin ahead of his presidential return. According to DeFiLlama, Raydium currently boasts over $2.15 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL), surpassing the TVL of other prominent chains like Sei, Aptos, and Polygon.

Table of Contents Ethereum finally back in play Bernstein’s thesis and ETH’s shifting role Upgrades, blobs, and long-term roadmap Ethereum price prediction and technical signals Ethereum finally back in play Ethereum ( ETH ) is making a quiet but strong recovery. After weeks of staying relatively muted, the second-largest crypto by market cap has climbed more than 6% in the past 24 hours and is now trading around $2,613 as of May 14. ETH Price Chart | Source: crypto.news Over the past week, ETH has gained 44%, briefly touching $2,736 on May 13, its highest level since late February. Just a month ago, ETH was trading near $1,336 on Apr. 9. That low came during heightened concerns over U.S.-induced trade wars, which had rattled broader markets. Since then, Ethereum has rebounded nearly 95%, supported by easing macro uncertainty and a growing sense of optimism about its long-term role in the digital economy. On Tuesday, the latest U.S. inflation report showed consumer prices rising just 0.2% month over month in April. Annual inflation stood at 2.3%, only slightly above the Federal Reserve’s target. Market sentiment has also improved following the 90-day trade truce between the U.S. and China. Ethereum is also gaining strength from within its own ecosystem. The recent Pectra upgrade introduced performance improvements aimed at enhancing network efficiency and transaction speed. The upgrade went live when ETH was priced near $1,700, and its rollout has aligned with the broader price recovery, reinforcing market confidence in Ethereum’s future scalability. The pace of the rally so far has been measured. Trading volumes are building steadily, and there is little indication of speculative excess or leveraged positioning. Let’s see how the latest developments are affecting Ethereum price prediction. Bernstein’s thesis and ETH’s shifting role According to a client note by research and brokerage firm Bernstein, led by analyst Gautam Chhugani, Ethereum’s bounce is being driven by three overlapping forces that mark a departure from its previously lagging performance. Until recently, Ethereum had been underperforming both Bitcoin ( BTC ) and faster layer 1 competitors. The ETH to BTC ratio dropped by around 45% over the past year, as investors favored Bitcoin for its perceived store-of-value role, especially following the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs . At the same time, retail attention shifted toward newer chains offering lower fees and faster transactions. In Bernstein’s view, Ethereum found itself stuck in the middle. It was no longer the fastest platform for everyday users, nor did it command the same level of institutional confidence as Bitcoin. That context is now beginning to change. Bernstein notes that Ethereum is starting to benefit from increased focus on stablecoin usage, real-world asset tokenization, and the maturation of layer 2 networks. Stablecoins and tokenized securities are gaining meaningful traction as tools for payments and settlement. Ethereum hosts more than half of the total stablecoin supply, positioning it as a natural settlement layer for these transactions. Real-world tokenization, now valued at over $22 billion according to RWA.xyz, is also centered around Ethereum, with firms like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton leading deployment efforts. The second major driver comes from Ethereum’s layer 2 ecosystem. While some have questioned whether these networks directly benefit Ethereum, Bernstein points out that several institutional-grade applications are beginning to emerge. Coinbase-backed Base, for instance, generated $84 million in revenue last year. These layer 2 platforms still rely on ETH for settlement and gas, reinforcing the asset’s underlying economic utility. Robinhood’s acquisition of WonderFi, which operates a layer 2 network, suggests a potential path where brokers may begin launching tokenized equities on Ethereum-compatible infrastructure. The third factor is more market-driven. Over the past year, many hedge funds used ETH as a hedge within their portfolios, shorting it while remaining long on other assets such as Bitcoin or Solana ( SOL ), creating consistent downward pressure on ETH relative to the broader market. As the Ethereum narrative begins to align more closely with real-world adoption trends, many of those short positions are being closed. Bernstein sees this unwind as one of the forces contributing to ETH’s recent outperformance. Taken together, these factors suggest that Ethereum’s rise is being fueled not only by shifting sentiment, but also by deeper structural changes in how the network is used and valued. Upgrades, blobs, and long-term roadmap Ethereum is entering a new phase of development, marked by a renewed push toward scalability and real-world usability. The shift began with the rollout of Pectra, the network’s most important upgrade since the Merge in 2022. Key improvements introduced in Pectra include a doubling of blob capacity for layer 2 networks, which helps reduce congestion and lower transaction fees. The upgrade also enables Account Abstraction, allowing users to pay gas fees in stablecoins such as Dai ( DAI ) and USD Coin ( USDC ). Another major change involves increasing the maximum validator stake from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH, making node operations more efficient for institutional participants. With Pectra now live, developer attention has moved to Fusaka , Ethereum’s next major protocol upgrade, which is expected by the end of 2025. A central feature of Fusaka is Peer Data Availability Sampling, or PeerDAS. The proposal aims to help ETH manage larger volumes of off-chain data while preserving network security and performance. PeerDAS builds on the concept of blob data, introduced during the earlier Dencun upgrade. Blobs are temporary data chunks stored outside the Ethereum mainnet and are increasingly used by layer 2 networks such as Arbitrum ( ARB ), Optimism ( OP ), and Base. These networks improve efficiency by processing transactions off-chain while continuing to use ETH for final settlement and security. Relying on blobs allows them to operate at lower cost and higher speed without overloading the base layer. PeerDAS enhances this system by allowing validators to check only small samples of blob data rather than full data sets. The change improves bandwidth efficiency and supports a higher transaction load without compromising decentralization or speed. Reducing the burden on validators while maintaining network performance could make it easier for developers and institutions to deploy complex applications at scale. Despite these advances, Ethereum’s upgrade timeline remains a point of concern. The network has a history of delays, often caused by extensive testing and the challenges of coordinating a decentralized developer ecosystem. Pectra, originally targeted for late 2024, faced multiple postponements before going live in May 2025. Similar uncertainty now surrounds Fusaka, with much of the community watching closely to see whether it will remain on schedule. At the same time, alternative blockchains are attracting attention through faster release cycles and simpler governance models. The contrast has sparked ongoing debate about the Ethereum Foundation’s role and the network’s ability to adapt with greater agility. Ethereum price prediction and technical signals Ethereum’s rally over the past week has surfaced several key signals pointing to a shift in sentiment, although some caution remains. Daan Crypto Trades highlights the unusually large weekly candle, which he attributes to the unwinding of accumulated short positions built up over recent months. $ETH Big level here. We saw the biggest weekly candle in years fueled by a ton of built up shorts from the past few months. I'd say play this level by level and watch for next week to develop to see where these alts are going to get picked up after the squeezes are done. pic.twitter.com/DTHcTHTeHh — Daan Crypto Trades (@DaanCrypto) May 11, 2025 In his view, such moves can distort near-term price signals. He recommends watching how the next few weeks unfold to assess whether actual demand follows, implying that the recent momentum may be partly mechanical and could fade as positioning resets. Michaël van de Poppe takes a broader perspective, noting that the ETH to BTC ratio has climbed approximately 40% from its recent low. He sees this as a sign of changing capital rotation, with Ethereum beginning to recover after a long stretch of underperformance. A 40% increase on $ETH /BTC since the low. That's the change of market pendulum. I think we'll see some more upside, but would be waiting for the standard 20-30% corrections to jump into $ETH . The smaller caps will yield a higher return, way higher. pic.twitter.com/DEE10RAYl7 — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) May 14, 2025 At the same time, he warns that 20% to 30% corrections are normal during strong trends and should be treated as expected volatility rather than early signs of weakness. From a technical standpoint, some analysts are watching for potential gaps. According to Titan of Crypto, ETH recently filled a major Chicago Mercantile Exchange gap between $2,540 and $2,620. #Ethereum $3,200 Soon? 📈 On the #ETH CME Futures daily chart, the gap between $2,540 – $2,620 has now been filled ✅ Only one remains above: 🕳️ $2,890 – $3,230 ⏳ Gaps tend to get filled. pic.twitter.com/zCTsR36tvf — Titan of Crypto (@Washigorira) May 13, 2025 The next unfilled gap lies in the $2,890 to $3,230 zone. While CME gaps have historically shown a tendency to close over time, they do not always fill immediately. These levels may act as demand zones if upward momentum persists. VirtualBacon, another market analyst, argues that ETH’s earlier underperformance led to a period of mispricing. His base case suggests ETH could reach $10,000 if Bitcoin climbs to $200,000 and the ETH to BTC ratio returns to 0.05. 8/x My $ETH price target hasn’t changed. Just the timeline. I still expect: • $10K $ETH if $BTC hits $200K and ETH/BTC reaches 0.05 • $12K $ETH if $BTC hits $250K or ETH/BTC reaches 0.06 This isn't a moonshot, this is just a repeat of past cycles. — VirtualBacon (@VirtualBacon0x) May 12, 2025 A move toward $12,000 is also possible under more aggressive conditions, including BTC rising to $250,000 or ETH to BTC touching 0.06. Some institutional forecasts support similar expectations. In a previous analysis, asset manager VanEck projected that ETH could rise above $6,000 in 2025. Whether these Ethereum price predictions materialize will depend on broader market sentiment and how quickly investor focus shifts from speculation to real-world utility. As always, caution remains essential, and always remember the golden rule: never invest more than you can afford to lose. Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

In a May 14 notice, the Blockchain Association said its current CEO, Kristin Smith, would be stepping down for Mersinger on May 16, allowing an interim head of the group to work until the CFTC commissioner assumes the role on June 2. Though her term at the CFTC was expected to last until April 2028, the BA said Mersinger is set to leave the agency on May 30. The departure of Mersinger, who has served in one of the CFTC’s Republican seats since 2022, opens the way for President Donald Trump to nominate another member to the financial regulator. Rules require that no more than three commissioners belong to the same political party. Like the Securities and Exchange Commission, the CFTC is one of the significant US financial regulators whose policies impact digital assets. Lawmakers in Congress are currently working to pass a market structure bill to clarify the roles each agency could take in overseeing and regulating crypto. Related: KuCoin’s settlement with CFTC in flux after Trump policy shift New leadership at the Blockchain Association had been expected since Smith announced her departure on April 1 to become the next president of the Solana Policy Institute. A spokesperson for the Blockchain Association did not respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment at the time of publication. Some of the biggest crypto firms in the US, including Coinbase, Ripple Labs, and Chainlink Labs, are members of the Association. According to its website, the organization claims to “support a future-forward, pro-innovation national policy and regulatory framework for the crypto economy.” Changing the leadership at a major US financial regulator A nominee of former President Joe Biden, Mersinger has called for standardized crypto-related policies and said the CFTC was the “ideal regulator for the cryptocurrency spot market.” Some expected she would lead the regulator following the election of Trump and the departure of then-CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam, but Commissioner Caroline Pham took on the role in an acting capacity in January. Trump chose former commissioner Brian Quintenz to chair the CFTC in February, but his nomination has not moved through the Senate for a vote in roughly three months. Commissioner Christy Goldsmith Romero reportedly said she plans to leave the agency once Quintenz is confirmed, potentially giving Trump the chance to nominate three new commissioners to fill the five-seat panel. Any CFTC commissioner picked by the president needs a majority vote in the Senate to be confirmed for a five-year term or to fill in for a resigning member.

JPMorgan settles its first transaction on a public blockchain using $LINK and $ONDO to move tokenized treasuries beyond its private network pic.twitter.com/alGdtWGfVJ — Coin Compass (@CoinCompassHQ) May 14, 2025 This wasn’t just a test. JPMorgan actually moved real money between accounts on its internal blockchain to complete the transaction on Ondo’s decentralized infrastructure. This makes it the bank’s first-ever settlement involving a public blockchain structure. Before, JPMorgan Chase’s digital asset operations were mostly carried out on its private chain Onyx. The future of a hybrid financial system that combines TradFi and DeFi There has been a lot of talk about crypto and the digital asset class so far this year. This is because the first crypto-friendly government took office with the return of US President Donald Trump. With it has come beneficial regulations that have been put in place. The biggest one was debanking, which has now been done away with the proof of JPMorgan’s move. Nelli Zaltsman, Head of Platform Settlement Solutions at Kinexys, JPMorgan’s blockchain unit, says that this is the first time the bank has put in place infrastructure ready for real use. JPMorgan has tried public blockchain tests before, including one with Siemens Digital in 2024. JPMorgan relied on Chainlink’s interoperability protocol to execute the transaction. It allows private and public blockchains to communicate securely. This kind of merging could pave the way for a hybrid financial system that combines infrastructure built for institutions with innovations in decentralized finance (DeFi). “This is not just another POC [proof of concept],” said Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov, emphasizing the significance of the development. “This is the beginning of something big.” Also, according to Ondo Finance, the transaction was the first cross-chain, atomic Delivery versus Payment settlement of a tokenized asset on the Ondo Chain testnet. Tokenized assets and cross-chain payments are important parts of how finance is changing, and JPMorgan’s move shows that institutions are becoming more confident in public blockchain technology. This big step forward could speed up Wall Street’s adoption of DeFi tools. JPMorgan is not the only bank planning to enter the crypto market. CEO of Bank of America Brian Moynihan said this year that the company would release its stablecoin. He said that the bank was just waiting for the law that would make the product offering legal in the US as a whole. The SEC crypto task force roundtable of tokenizations influences investors Tokenized real-world assets are quietly going from an idea to a foundation in 2025 as regulated platforms start to change global finance from the inside out. As reported by Cryptopolitan, the SEC’s Crypto Task Force held a roundtable on tokenization this week. This is the fourth meeting in a series that looks at how to regulate crypto assets. Using asset tokenization as a way for TradFi, like banks and DeFi, to work together was a big part of this discussion. This has yielded results. Besides JPMorgan, investment company VanEck and the tokenization platform Securitize are launching a tokenized real-world asset (RWA) fund that gives investors access to US Treasury bills. With this move, VanEck joins many traditional financial companies that are getting into RWA tokenization. VanEck said in a May 13 statement that the fund, which is called VBILL, will be launched on the Avalanche, BNB Chain, Ethereum, and Solana blockchains. For investments working on Avalanche, BNB Chain, and Solana, the minimum subscription to the fund is $100,000. On Ethereum, the minimum subscription is $1 million.

The company’s legacy re-commerce business is in decline, and it faced Nasdaq de-listing due to financial reporting issues but regained compliance in December. Upexi's SOL investments have appreciated, but the company's valuation at nearly 4x its SOL holdings is considered too high, leading to a 'sell' recommendation. Despite generating yield from staking SOL, the high premium on UPXI shares makes it an unattractive investment at its current market cap. By now, most in the financial world are likely aware of what Strategy ( MSTR )( STRF ) is doing with Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). Through convertible notes, common stock issuance, and even preferred shares, Strategy is raising capital essentially any way it can in order to buy Bitcoin. What is less known, is that there are other companies attempting similar strategies with both Bitcoin and alternative digital assets. One such company is Upexi, Inc ( UPXI ). Like Strategy, Upexi operates a legacy business outside of digital assets that is in clear decline. However unlike Strategy, Upexi is prioritizing Solana ( SOL-USD ) rather than BTC. In this article, we'll briefly look at Upexi's legacy business, examine the company's balance sheet strategy, and get into whether or not SOL is the right kind of asset for such a move. Upexi's 'Re-commerce' Business & Bitcoin Mining Prior to jumping headfirst in the world of crypto, Upexi primarily operated a 're-commerce' business where it sold wellness products direct-to-consumer and through Amazon's ( AMZN ) marketplace. Entities that were previously owned outright or partially by Upexi included Tytan Tiles, E-Core, VitaMedica, and Interactive Offers. Those assets have all been sold. The company still operates LuckyTail, PRAX, and Cure Mushrooms. Data by YCharts After significant revenue declines over the last several quarters and mounting net losses, the company found itself facing Nasdaq de-listing last November after failing to file both its fiscal 2024 10-K and subsequent 10-Q in a timely manner. Upexi regained compliance in late December . Prior to Nasdaq compliance issues, Upexi had already begun a restructuring that saw the company selling assets, brands, and eliminating debt. By the end of December 2024, the balance sheet had just $400k in cash/equivalents, $6.1 million in current assets, $4.2 million in net property, plant & equipment and $17.5 million in total assets. With $13.8 million in total liabilities - $10.6 million of which was current - and 1,045,429 shares outstanding at the end of the year, UPXI had a book value of about $3.60 per share. This year, Upexi announced its shift in focus to Bitcoin and crypto through newly established and owned brands ChainBitMiner and QuantumHash. The former appears to simply be a holding company for Upexi's digital assets and the latter seems to be more mining-focused despite still being quite vague regarding the actual operations of the business: The Company will look to capitalize with investments in Crypto mining with a main focus on Bitcoin mining. The Company does not initially plan to operate its own mining operations. The quote above is from the Upexi's late-January press release. The quote below is current as of mid-May from the company's website : Leveraging Hash-as-a-Service to mine our own coins, expand our digital portfolio, and create low-risk digital treasury levered growth. We seek to mine Bitcoin as well as high growth opportunity alt coins with immediate conversion to Bitcoin. If I'm reading these accurately, it seems like Upexi's original plan was to scale BTC holdings through usage of cloud hash services similar to the ones offered by companies like Bitdeer ( BTDR ) and BitFuFu ( FUFU ). Which anyone who follows my work may know are often terrible deals for the mining plan buyers. In March, Upexi announced a letter of intent to buy a 2 MW Bitcoin mining facility but didn't provide much detail beyond the following: The facility is currently utilizing less than half its available capacity output. Quantum Hash intends to update current equipment and add the latest and fastest mining machines available to maximize hash rate and maximize bitcoin mined monthly, upon closing. As far as I can tell, active and prospective shareholders don't know where this mining facility is located or what kind of machines are currently hashing. More importantly, it appears as though the company has already pivoted priority again based on how it is allocating an enormous capital raise in April. Solana Strategy Less than two months after the company announced the Bitcoin mining LOI, Upexi raised over $100 million through private placement from several venture funds as well as prominent crypto advocates like Frank Chaparro, Arthur Hayes, Austin Federa, and Joey Krug. As part of this arrangement, the company issued 36 million common shares and has been deploying that capital into Solana purchases. After initially announcing the acquisition of 45,733 SOL for $6.7 million in late-April, Upexi subsequently added over a half million SOL in less than a month. Announced Locked? Cost SOL Cost Basis 4/29/24 No $6,700,000 45,733 $147 5/6/24 No $23,216,705 155,767 $149 5/12/24 Yes $44,128,641 326,347 $135 N/A* No $10,154,654 68,867 $147 Total $84,200,000 596,714 $141 Source: Upexi, *Author's estimate based on Upexi cost basis and announced holdings The table above shows announced and estimated purchases based on recent press releases. However, 596,714 SOL at a cost basis of $141 per coin is not an estimate; those figures were provided straight from Upexi in a May 12th press release . The company purchased over half its SOL stack at a discount because they're locked at a weighted maturity of 1.4 years. Meaning, after initially expressing interest in Bitcoin mining through both hash services and company-owned infrastructure, Upexi appears far more committed to the Solana ecosystem at this juncture. Data by YCharts So far, these acquisitions have actually worked out wonderfully. For $84.2 million, Upexi has acquired Solana tokens that have a current market value of over $104 million and the company is actively staking those assets for chain-native yield as well. Upexi, Spring Investor Deck In Upexi's Spring investor deck, the company laid out its plan for accretive issuance through both common stock and convertible debt. The company specifically mentions in the deck how SOL ETFs and the return of memecoins are positive catalysts for SOL's price. I'm not generally a fan of memecoins and have expressed that in prior work. But if they are going to have a resurgence this year, Solana is likely to be the chain where it happens. Is Solana The Right Play? As of this article submission, Solana's reward rate from staking is 8.3%: Solana Staking Rate vs Inflation (Blockworks) Keep in mind though that unlike Bitcoin, which is hard capped at 21 million coins, Solana doesn't have a limited supply. Instead, Solana has a 5.3% rate of inflation that declines over time. This gives Solana staking a 'real yield' of 3% before any appreciation or depreciation of the asset price. Looking at the 'real yield' on a quarterly average, we can see that the real yield line in purple has held up well in the 3-4% range despite nominal APY in general decline going back to Q4-22 - the declining inflation rate has supported real yield in spite of lower nominal returns. Another consideration is fees from transactions. Like Bitcoin miners who make revenue from both issuance and transaction fee payments, Solana validators are paid through both token emissions and fees from network usage. The latter has been terrific for Solana since the start of 2024 as the network has grown share of fees among top smart contract blockchains: Fee Share, Top Smart Contract L1s (Artemis) Compared with some of the other top smart contract blockchains by market cap, Solana has generally fallen somewhere between 20-40% share of the market over the 8 months. Year to date, Solana has generated over $430 million in network fees which is second only to Tron ( TRX-USD ). And while one could certainly argue Solana's rally has been driven by the casino-culture that is memecoins rather than expansion of real utility through stablecoin usage, as long as memecoins have an incentive to exist, they will persist. Pump.fun - the interface used for memecoin generation - will be sharing 50% of Pumpswap revenue with coin creators in the future. This could perhaps drive more memecoins on Solana. The Elephant In The Room Keep in mind, UPXI did $4 million in revenue for the quarter ended December 2024 and generated a $1.3 million net loss in the same quarter. The underlying legacy business was worth about $3.60 per share at the end of December. With the $100 capital raise and nearly 40 million shares issued subsequent to the end of last year, we now have a company that likely has somewhere between $5 to 10 million in cash remaining after using $5.3 million of the $100 million capital raise for working capital and debt reduction as well as $84 million for SOL purchases. $373 million market cap (Seeking Alpha) So for a re-commerce business worth a few million at best, $10 million in cash at most, and $104 million in SOL that is earning a 3% real yield after inflation, investors can buy UPXI at a $373 million valuation - or nearly 4x the Solana held by the company. I doubt this needs to be said; but that's probably way too high a premium for exposure to staked SOL. Closing Thoughts Valuation aside, this is all quite the turnaround for an entity that was facing Nasdaq de-listing just a few months ago. Even the path to get here was a bit confusing. It looked like Upexi was making a play on raising capital to buy Bitcoin à la Strategy and Michael Saylor just a few weeks ago. However, it now appears as though Solana is the ecosystem Upexi is primarily banking on. Wise? Possibly. Provided the Solana can be staked for blockchain rewards, there's an argument to be made for acquiring SOL with the purpose of generating yield on those assets. Of course, things often come down to price. Even though Upexi may have purchased SOL at a great price, that doesn't mean $10 a share for UPXI is a good price. At a market cap just shy of $400 million and a little over $100 million in SOL - I'm going to go out on a limb here and call UPXI a 'sell.'",SOL-USD|UPXI,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|SOL|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-05-14 15:30:00

The US-China trade tension, which has been the focus of the crypto market for months, has eased after talks over the weekend reached an agreement to keep tariffs at low rates for 90 days. However, as the two sides shook hands on the long-awaited trade deal, President Donald Trump's post caused chaos once again. Trump also mentioned cryptocurrencies in his statements while visiting Qatar as part of his Middle East visit. Reiterating his support for cryptocurrencies once again, Trump said that the US is ahead in crypto and is leading China. “I am a big supporter of cryptocurrencies. We lead China in crypto. We are ahead of China.” Trump recently underlined that his goal is to be a leader in crypto, and warned that China could lead the way in crypto if the US falls behind. Trump said, “I want crypto. I think crypto is important because if we don't do it, China will. And they will be ahead. Crypto is new and very popular.” Related News: US President Donald Trump Made Very Special Statements About Memeconi TRUMP and Cryptocurrencies! Will He Donate His Crypto Profits? As you may recall, after months of tension, the US and China have agreed to reduce business. Accordingly, the Chinese administration will reduce the customs duty on US-origin products from 125% to 10% for 90 days. In return, the US will reduce the 145% duty it applies to China to 30%. *This is not investment advice.

After months of choppy action and bearish sentiment, bulls are clearly back in control. ETH has reclaimed several key levels with conviction, signaling a potential continuation toward higher targets. Related Reading: XRP Open Interest Surges 41% As Speculation Grows – Over $1B Added In Just One Week Price action now looks structurally bullish, with Ethereum pushing through resistance zones that previously capped upside for weeks. This rally has reignited investor confidence and brought renewed attention to Ethereum’s medium-term outlook, especially as altcoins start to show strength alongside Bitcoin’s recent consolidation. According to fresh data from Glassnode, the next major resistance area to watch is at $3,100, where Ethereum is likely to encounter heavier sell pressure. This level, derived from pricing bands, now defines Ethereum’s current trading range and will likely dictate price direction in the coming sessions. With volatility returning and sentiment improving, Ethereum appears poised for a critical breakout or a decisive retest of support, depending on how bulls handle the next leg. Ethereum Nears Key Resistance As Altseason Expectations Grow Ethereum has rallied over 98% since its April 9th low, marking one of its most powerful recoveries in recent years. This explosive move has not only flipped sentiment from bearish to bullish, but also reignited speculation around a broader altseason — a period in which altcoins significantly outperform Bitcoin. After months of heavy selling pressure that began in late December, Ethereum is now showing sustained strength for the first time. The price has reclaimed critical levels, and momentum continues to build as traders and investors rotate capital back into ETH and other large-cap altcoins. Market participants are watching closely to see if Ethereum can maintain this pace and confirm a longer-term trend reversal. Top analyst Ali Martinez shared Ethereum’s MVRV Extreme Deviation Pricing Bands, offering a clear technical framework for what’s next. According to the data, the next key resistance level is at $3,100 — a region that could act as a short-term ceiling if buying pressure fades. On the downside, the major support zone sits at $2,233, a critical level to hold in the event of a pullback. As Ethereum continues to climb, these levels will become increasingly important. A clean breakout above $3,100 could open the door to a broader rally across altcoins, while a rejection or correction would likely test the market’s true conviction. For now, ETH remains in a bullish structure, supported by growing volume, on-chain signals, and renewed investor enthusiasm. The coming days will be crucial in determining whether Ethereum leads the charge into a full-fledged altseason. Related Reading: Solana Network Activity Grows As 11M Wallets Now Hold 0.1 SOL Or More – Analyst ETH Price Action: Testing Resistance After Massive Rally Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading around $2,604, consolidating after a sharp surge that lifted it from under $1,400 to a high of $2,725 in just two weeks. The daily chart shows that ETH is now approaching the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) at $2,702.60, which is acting as a key resistance level. This zone also coincides with recent local highs from early February, making it a critical area to break for further upside continuation. The recent rally brought strong volume and bullish momentum, with ETH closing multiple daily candles above the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $2,435.66. This is a positive sign for trend reversal after months of sustained bearish pressure. However, today’s pullback signals that bulls are losing some steam as the price tests this crucial resistance. Related Reading: Ethereum Recovery Gains Strength: Massive Comeback Above Key Support If ETH can consolidate above the $2,500–$2,600 range and break through the 200-day SMA with convincing volume, the next upside target lies near the $3,100 level, as noted in recent technical studies. On the downside, maintaining support above $2,435–$2,450 is essential to avoid a deeper correction. The coming days will reveal whether Ethereum can turn this consolidation into a true breakout or if further cooling is needed before the next leg up.

Speaking at a recent panel alongside crypto exchange Kraken’s head of consumer Mark Greenberg, McDonald argued the rise of stablecoins marks an ""evolution"" in how money moves globally. ""It’s an alternative way of making a U.S. dollar payment, but doing it in a frictionless, cost-effective way,"" he said. Ripple’s entry into the space with RLUSD, a fully backed and regulated stablecoin, is part of a broader push to replace outdated, fragmented cross-border payment systems. “We’ve seen the use of stablecoins in payments, and that was a main driver for us getting into the business,” McDonald said. Greenberg underscored the inefficiencies of the current financial system. “It is way, way too hard to move money around the world,” he said. “Stablecoins are the answer for that, and I think what we're seeing now is a tipping point.” Kraken is a founding member of the Global Dollar Network , a consortium of crypto and traditional finance firms that issues the USDG stablecoin. Both executives said that yield-bearing stablecoins will be the next frontier—but regulators aren’t there yet. ""If you're holding deposits, you should be able to earn on those deposits,” Kraken's Greenberg said, though he noted differing regulatory stances across jurisdictions. For example, USDG cannot pay yield in the European Union according to MiCA rules. McDonald said that Ripple want to offer yield on its stablecoin but would need to register RLUSD as a security in the U.S. “That’s a whole different journey,” he said. In the next five years, both executives agreed that stablecoins are set to reshape traditional finance as they become more ubiquitous. McDonald pointed to Ripple’s acquisition of prime broker Hidden Road as a key step toward using stablecoins as collateral and cross-margin in capital markets. Greenberg said he sees stablecoins become so embedded in the financial system that “no one talks about them anymore—just like no one talks about SWIFT or wires.” Read more: Stablecoins to Go Mainstream in 2025 After U.S. Regulatory Progress: Deutsche Bank",Consensus Toronto 2025 Coverage|Stablecoin|Ripple|Kraken|CT2025|News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-14 15:33:52

Better-than-expected US inflation data and a US-China trade agreement have revived risk-on sentiment, opening the doors to fresh retail liquidity. The 20% weekly climb solidifies XRP’s escape from a 5-month-long downtrend. Clear of this hurdle, XRP has stronger in the “best crypto to buy” conversation. Open Interest Hits Post-Inauguration Rally Levels An analyst at CryptoQuant, Boris Vest, noted that XRP futures data on Binance shows that speculation is making a comeback. While still far from the post-inauguration rally’s $1.5 billion peak, XRP is currently seeing levels parallel to the early onset of the post-election rally at $940 million. XRP Open Interest. Source: CryptoQuant. The surge suggests the return of retail liquidity, with traders actively participating in XRP price moves. With recent FUD easing, the door has opened to bullishness. More so, the analyst highlighted a Taker Buy/Sell Ratio reading of 0.91 as a reflection of aggressive selling. Yet, XRP’s price stability suggests these sell orders are being absorbed. According to Vest, this pattern of quiet accumulation beneath the surface suggests that market participants may be positioning ahead of a potential upward move. XRP Price Analysis: How High Could the Surge Go? The weekly surge coincides with the breakout from the falling wedge pattern that has defined the multi-month XRP price downtrend. XRP / USDT 1-day chart, falling wedge pattern. Source: TradingView / Binance. If momentum continues, the pattern sets a breakout target around $4, representing a potential 53% surge from current prices. This outlook is supported by the MACD, which continues to widen its lead above the signal line—often an early sign of a sustained mid-term trend. That said, the sharp upward move has pushed the RSI to near-overbought conditions at 69, and an upward move beyond this point could exhaust buying pressure and give way to a correction. However, a short-term correction is a natural next step to ensure the stability of the longer-term uptrend. Consolidation around the Immediate $2.50 support could be a necessary breather for the next leg up. Looking further ahead, the coming month presents some major catalysts with the approval deadline of US XRP spot ETFs on June 17. Spot ETFs are viewed as key drivers of liquidity and institutional adoption for digital assets. After launching, BTC ETFs accounted for an estimated 75% of new Bitcoin investments.

The pilot transaction, conducted through its Kinexys Digital Payments platform, involved tokenized U.S. Treasuries and was settled on Ondo Chain’s testnet, according to a May 14 press release . This transaction marks the debut of a Delivery versus Payment (DvP) model, which synchronizes payment and asset transfers to reduce counterparty risk and settlement delays. The deal utilized Kinexys, JPMorgan’s blockchain division, to handle the payment leg, while the asset side consisted of Ondo Finance’s tokenized short-term Treasury fund (OUSG). These blockchain-based treasuries are designed to offer exposure to U.S. government debt with the benefits of real-time, transparent settlement. Kinexys, which reportedly processes over $2 billion in daily transaction volume, connected its private network to the public Ondo Chain, a notable shift from the bank’s historically closed-network approach. At the same time, Chainlink’s secure cross-chain orchestration infrastructure, known as the Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE), facilitated the atomic, cross-network settlement. CRE coordinated the transfer across the permissioned Kinexys system and the public Ondo Chain, ensuring real-time finality, enhanced liquidity, and reduced counterparty risk. “It is becoming increasingly clear to the world’s institutions that they have a large addressable market in the public chain community and that they need a reliable set of technical standards and cross-chain connection capabilities to successfully transact in this new world,” said Sergey Nazarov, Chainlink co-founder. JPMorgan blockchain ventures It’s worth noting that this early May transaction is not JPMorgan’s first venture beyond its private network. The entity has previously tested blockchain integrations, including a 2024 pilot with Siemens Digital. This shift by the banking giant comes as the United States moves toward more favorable cryptocurrency regulations following President Donald Trump’s election. Nelli Zaltsman, head of platform settlement solutions at Kinexys, emphasized that this new venture was not driven by political changes or investors’ recent enthusiasm for crypto. Instead, it’s part of the bank’s strategic roadmap. While the bank’s CEO, Jamie Dimon, has been a vocal Bitcoin critic , he has acknowledged that blockchain technology can find use cases in the financial sector.

Harris said the process to become regulated in her state can be difficult but, she argued, New York's high standards have proven effective. ""The proof is in the pudding when you see that FTX, Voyager, Celsius didn't pass our test and therefore couldn't do business in New York,"" she said, naming firms that later spectacularly collapsed. Among U.S. states, New York has been in the vanguard of crypto regulation, having established its BitLicense to regulate crypto firms , and devoting what Harris said was a 60-person staff to the work. With Congress still working on crypto regulations, the narrow jurisdiction of the U.S. Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) remains the only federal-level supervision, so the states represent the remainder of U.S. oversight of the industry. Harris' deputy overseeing digital assets, Ken Coghill, also appeared at Consensus on Wednesday. He said the key issue is on preventing money laundering and other financial crime. Crypto licensees and applicants often underestimate how much work it takes to become a regulated entity. Most applicants don't make it, he noted. ""You're not just presenting a product; you're presenting yourself,"" Coghill said. ""There's a tremendous amount of homework that needs to be done"" — particularly in understanding and outlining ""what the risks are that your business creates.""",Consensus Toronto 2025 Coverage|Regulation|NYDFS|Adrienne Harris|CT2025|News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-14 15:44:28

The network is considered secure due to its staking requirement, but Ethereum is one of the networks facing the most exploits. The Ethereum Foundation announced the trillion-dollar security initiative, aiming to secure the entire ecosystem in the case of wider adoption. The potential value of Ethereum reflects an average holding of $1,000, collectively amounting to trillions of dollars. The Ethereum ecosystem is one of the most heavily affected by hackers . Logic flaws in smart contracts, bridges, DEX trading attacks, and personal wallet attacks are among the most common exploits. The ecosystem also allows for hiding the funds, with the Tornado Cash mixer and other DeFi services allowing the hackers to disguise the origin of funds. The Ethereum Foundation aims to mitigate those risks, so even large organizations would be willing to place over $1T in a smart contract. The initiative arrives at a time when ETH is trying to revive its market price. ETH traded at $2,601.91 after touching the highest levels since February. Ethereum Foundation gathers data on security threats The initiative will be led by Fredrik Svantes and Josh Stark, the initial co-chairs of the project. They will also have a three-person ecosystem stewards team, who will communicate with projects and provide input and advice. The new team will map the Ethereum landscape for security threats and potential attack vectors across the entire EVM technology stack. The Ethereum Foundation has already set up a form for suggestions and reporting general security concerns. The findings will be presented in the form of a special report to identify focus areas. The mapping stage will investigate multiple Ethereum aspects, including blind signing, frontend security, wallet security, smart contracts, cloud infrastructure, consensus and protocol security, as well as Internet-level attacks, such as DNS-level censorship. The team assigned by the Ethereum Foundation will identify and communicate pressing issues. Currently, on-chain security is still performed on a case-by-case basis, with special entities reviewing smart contracts. Yet even vetted, secure projects face exploits, suggesting the need for a common standard for identifying potential threats. Ethereum remains the top hacked chain Estimated on-chain hacks have taken up to $5.3B in value, depending on the current asset price. Ethereum makes up between 40% and 50% of all hacks happening directly on the L1 chain. Multiple hacks also affected L2 chains, for the ease of switching back to Ethereum. Ethereum still faces the biggest hacks, ranging from infrastructure to DEX rug pulls, bridge attacks, smart contract exploits, and wallet phishing. | Source: Dune Analytics Despite the threats, the Ethereum Foundation explained its rationale behind the initiative as trying to bring the world on-chain. 0.

However, the extra staking and security did not prevent hacks and, in fact, increased the amount stolen. Bridges between L1 and L2 were among the most attacked smart contracts due to the significant value locked and flaws in the smart contract logic.

Crypto industry participants are now more hopeful amid positive crypto-related legislative and regulatory progress under the Trump administration. However, challenges remain, particularly in the altcoin ETF approval sphere. SEC Delays SOL And Litecoin ETF Proposals The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has delayed deciding whether to allow the trading of altcoin spot ETFs, which would expose investors to Solana and Dogecoin. Wall Street’s biggest regulator said Tuesday that it would wait until October 2025 to decide next steps for Grayscale’s spot SOL Trust ETF. The SEC also delayed answering the proposed Grayscale Litecoin Trust, citing the need for more time to evaluate whether the filing meets legal and market structure requirements. According to data from CoinGecko, SOL is currently the six th-biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, while Litecoin is the 25th largest. LTC is a forked version of Bitcoin launched in 2011 by ex-Google employee Charlie Lee. Over 70 Crypto ETFs Awaiting SEC Approval The SEC currently has over 70 altcoin ETF applications to consider following the regulator’s approval last year of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which are the most successful launch in ETF history. The SEC had rejected applications for Bitcoin funds for over 10 years before giving them the regulatory sign-off, and then greenlighted Ethereum ETFs a couple of months later. Now, the SEC has a new chair, Paul Atkins , following the election of crypto-friendly President Trump, and investment managers are trying their luck with other digital asset-related products. Since his return to the White House in January, the agency has thrown out multiple lawsuits against crypto companies and has held public roundtables with crypto industry leaders to discuss how to regulate the burgeoning industry. Notably, prominent asset managers like Bitwise, Franklin Templeton, Grayscale, and 21Shares have already submitted paperwork to get new crypto ETFs approved. Coins like SOL, Ripple-affiliated XRP, and Cardano’s ADA are among the biggest targets for issuers right now. Meanwhile, investors are now looking to the Polkadot and XRP-based ETFs deadlines next month. While those decisions may also be postponed as the SEC often takes full advantage of its 240-day review period, the agency is expected to take an overall friendlier approach to crypto ETFs than in the previous Biden administration.",Cryptocurrency|News|Litecoin|Solana,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|LTC|REGULATION|SOL,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-14 15:46:25

While panelists largely agreed that crypto is getting there, they emphasized that the path to institutional validation requires more than just price appreciation. Bitcoin Leads the Way Pasqual St-Jean argued that bitcoin has already cleared many of the hurdles that traditional assets must meet to be deemed investable by institutions like gold. “It has hedging mechanisms. It has different wrappers. It's a little bit easier to understand. It's a digital gold for a digital age,” he added. This accessibility, he noted, stands in contrast to other types of crypto assets, such as governance and utility tokens, which remain more difficult for institutional allocators to grasp.""When we talk about governance tokens, it's a little harder for institutions to wrap their minds around,” he said. “What exactly am I owning?” The ETF Effect The panelists pointed to the introduction of spot bitcoin ETFs — especially in the U.S. — as a turning point in crypto’s journey toward institutional legitimacy. Jonathan Steinberg, CEO of WisdomTree highlighted the irony in how former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler’s enforcement-heavy approach inadvertently laid the groundwork for a highly competitive and mature market. ""Gensler created just what he didn't want in the US,” Steinberg said. “There are more bitcoin ETPs than S&P 500 ETFs. He created a tremendously competitive and mature foundation for bitcoin, which I think is deserved for the asset class.” St-Jean agreed, calling the ETF wrapper a ""game changer,"" particularly for bitcoin. It allowed legal and compliance departments to step back and treat it as a regular investment decision, opening the door to more widespread adoption among institutions, he said. Education and Diversification Are Key Despite the strides made, Andy Baehr warned that bitcoin’s dominance may be holding back the broader crypto ecosystem. ""The crypto asset class is a bit hamstrung by the fact that there's this giant singular thing standing there that people have to understand first,” Baehr said. “Yet you miss out on real blockchain technology, Layer 1s, infrastructure, DeFi—if you don't dig deeper.” He likened the current moment to 1999, when online brokerages made tech stocks accessible to a wider investor base. Like then, liquidity vehicles such as ETFs could help create allocation engines for the crypto space, turning short-term trading into long-term investing. Still, the panelists were realistic about the growing pains. Steinberg pointed out that many institutions are still early in their due diligence. While some hedge funds have made the leap, most large allocators are still getting educated. The Road Ahead Panelists emphasized that the final push toward broad asset-class acceptance will likely depend on continued infrastructure development, regulatory clarity, and institutional products. ""We had to educate them that the regulator doesn't have the right to pick which asset class is investable if the infrastructure problem is solved,” St-Jean said. Looking forward, he argued that staking products, Layer 1 blockchain investments, and more diversified index products will be critical. ""You just own HTTP,” he said, drawing a parallel to early internet protocols. “Bitcoin they understand, now they’re starting to understand Layer 1s.” Scaramucci, for his part, remains bullish. ""We may not actually be bullish enough,” he said, citing the explosion of capital in the space, the wave of copycat strategies following Strategy’s lead, and Wall Street’s “selling machine” now pushing bitcoin and crypto ETFs. He added that while political risks remain, particularly with crypto becoming a hot-button issue in U.S. politics, the incentives are lining up for bipartisan support. ""If you get bitcoin to $500,000, people won’t just say it’s an asset class—they’ll treat it like one,” he said. Whether or not that price target is reached, the panel agreed: the foundation is there, the wrappers are in place, and institutions are finally showing up. Crypto’s transformation from curiosity to asset class is no longer a question of “if”—just “when.”",Consensus Toronto 2025 Coverage|Consensus|CT2025|News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-14 15:46:32

Bitcoin ( BTC ) was trading at $104,000 on Wednesday, just 5.25% below its all-time high of $109,300. It has jumped nearly 40% from its lowest point in April. The coin continues to see high demand, mostly from institutional investors. SoSoValue data shows that spot Bitcoin ETFs have added over $1.95 billion in inflows this year, bringing total inflows since inception to $41 billion.

Its supply on exchanges has dropped to a six-year low, continuing a trend that began in 2021. These dynamics will likely help support Bitcoin’s price in the long term.

With both platforms showing unique strengths, the upcoming market rebound presents intriguing opportunities. This article delves into their prospects, evaluating which one seems poised for the most significant growth. The comparison aims to guide investors in making informed decisions. Solana Price Dynamics: 1-Month Surge vs 6-Month Decline Solana experienced a gain of 28.74% in the past month, with a notable increase of 16.05% in just the last week. However, this follows a significant decline of 20.97% over the past six months. The price fluctuated between $109.63 and $171.27, indicating a brief recovery in the short term while still facing prevailing bearish pressure in the longer term. The recent movements have shown volatility and a quick shift in trader sentiment. Current trading levels show support at $71.65 and resistance at $194.93, with an additional resistance level at $256.57. Bulls have gained momentum with the recent price rises, but an RSI of 66.83 suggests caution. Traders should keep an eye on these levels for potential entry points near support and opportunities to take profits when reaching resistance. Ethereum's Bullish Turn Amid Altcoin Excitement Ethereum showed a strong monthly performance with prices rising nearly 50% over the last month after a six-month downturn of about 23%. Weekly gains of 35% highlight a swift recovery compared with previous losses. Active investor entry despite earlier bearish trends indicates renewed trading interest. The shift coincides with expectations for an altcoin season and a broader crypto bull run. Current prices range between roughly $1,469 and $2,038, with immediate resistance at $2,281 and a secondary level near $2,850. Support is noted around $1,142 and further below at $573. Bulls appear to command control within these levels, although the high RSI suggests caution. Traders may target entries near support and consider exits at resistance while monitoring volatility closely. Conclusion SOL and ETH both present strong potential for growth in the near future. ETH benefits from its established presence and wide adoption. SOL, on the other hand, impresses with its faster transaction speeds and lower costs. Each offers unique strengths and could see significant gains. Investors may find value in either, depending on their risk tolerance and market outlook.

Demand in the spot market has also been growing week over week. Ripple [XRP] has followed the broader crypto market trend, recording a gain of 21% in the past week and rising 3.43% in the past 24 hours. Market sentiment shows that while selling activity remains high, buyers are stepping up to counteract its impact on price. Sellers get absorbed by buyers Recent market analysis by CryptoQuant suggests that selling pressure is growing as XRP’s Taker Buy/Sell Ratio slides lower. A drop in this ratio below 1 implies that the broader derivatives market is selling. At press time, XRP had a reading of 0.9361, indicating more sellers than buyers. Source: CryptoQuant However, this high selling volume hasn’t reflected in price movement, as it continues to rise. According to the analysis, Binance traders have been actively driving the rise in XRP’s price. At the time of writing, XRP’s Open Interest on Binance had risen from a low of $530 million to a current high of $1.5 billion. Market bias among Binance traders was determined using the funding rate. The Funding Rate didn’t give a potential direction, as the market remains undecided with a neutral reading. Source: CryptoQuant An analysis of the funding fee provides insight into traders’ actions. Despite rising short positions, the funding rate continues to drop, signaling a market squeeze. AMBCrypto’s review of Binance’s Taker Buy/Sell Ratio confirms a bullish trend. At press time , the ratio stood at 3.3497, showing that buyers remain in control despite increasing short contracts. If Binance traders sustain or boost their buying volume, XRP could be set for a significant move soon. Retail spot traders aren’t left out Spot retail traders are also participating in the current market move and have contributed to XRP’s rally. In the past 24 hours alone, this group of traders has purchased $17.06 million worth of XRP, bringing the past week’s total purchases to $94.41 million. While these activities are predominantly bullish, liquidity clusters suggest a slight decline to the $2.50 region could occur. Source: Coinglass At that level, unfilled orders remain, and price often moves toward such zones. A dip to $2.50 would be minimal, given that XRP is currently trading at $2.58—a slight $0.08 decline.

While meme coins and overhyped projects often dominate headlines, analysts and long-term investors are increasingly pointing to MUTM as a project built on real fundamentals — and with its growing momentum, some now believe it could cross the $1 mark before 2026. With over $8 million raised and a presale price still set at $0.025, Mutuum is proving that investor interest doesn’t need to be driven by trend cycles. Instead, it’s gaining traction by offering one thing many other tokens lack — an actual working model. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Unlike tokens that rely on speculation alone, MUTM’s future price projections are grounded in platform usage. The platform enables open-access lending and borrowing, powered by automated smart contracts. Users can deposit crypto assets and receive mtTokens, which accrue value over time as interest is earned. Borrowers, in turn, access liquidity by locking collateral that exceeds their loan amount. Here’s where the token comes in: a portion of revenue generated from these transactions is used to buy MUTM tokens from the open market. These tokens are then redistributed to mtToken holders, creating an organic demand cycle that benefits users for simply participating. This model has analysts suggesting that if platform adoption continues to grow — and revenue cycles deepen — MUTM could realistically reach $1 or more within its first year post-launch. That makes it one of the most undervalued cryptocurrencies under $0.03 right now. MUTM is currently in its fourth presale phase, and over 72% of this round is already completed. Once it closes, the token price will increase to $0.03, with the public launch price set at $0.06. With more than 9,700 wallets already participating, investors are taking advantage of what could be the final opportunity to purchase MUTM at its lowest price point. As the token gains traction in crypto communities and DeFi forums, it’s being discussed more frequently as one of the best cryptos to buy now, especially among those who prefer structured projects over speculative hype. Mutuum Finance stands out not only for its token mechanics but also for its product roadmap. The platform is built for Layer 2 integration, which significantly reduces transaction costs while increasing speed and accessibility. The project is also set to introduce a stablecoin that will be fully backed by excess collateral. This asset will be created through borrower collateral and burned when loans are repaid or liquidated — keeping its supply in balance with actual platform usage. It provides another layer of functionality that will further support liquidity and engagement within the ecosystem. Critically, a beta version of the platform will launch alongside the token listing, allowing users to lend, borrow, and earn interest from day one — a major difference from projects that take months or years to deliver after fundraising. For instance, a $3,500 investment at the current $0.025 price will be worth $140,000 once MUTM reaches $1. This gain isn’t based on speculation — it’s tied to the protocol’s built-in revenue system, real user activity, and a product launching with functionality from day one. That’s why more investors are locking in their positions now, aiming to secure serious upside before the presale phases end. With the market warming up again, many are asking which crypto to buy today for long-term value. While short-term spikes can generate attention, Mutuum Finance is building for sustainability, offering clear use cases, stable income flows, and a roadmap already in motion. The opportunity to enter at $0.025 won’t last much longer — and if analyst forecasts prove correct, the $1 milestone may come sooner than expected. For those searching for the next big crypto with actual utility, MUTM continues to rise as one of the most compelling options ahead of 2026.

The former CEO and CFO of Cred, Daniel Schatt and Joseph Podulka, have pleaded guilty to fraud charges in a federal court. The crypto executives are now facing legal action over their offenses. Cred execs enter guilty plea Daniel Schatt, Cred’s co-founder and former CEO, and Joseph Podulka, the company’s former CFO, admitted in a San Francisco federal court that they misled their customers about the company’s financial health and lending practices, which led to losses exceeding $150 million. Their admission of guilt was part of the requirements of their plea deal with prosecutors, according to a May 13 text filing in a California District Court. Cred was established in 2018 and offered high-yield returns to cryptocurrency investors through its “CredEarn” program. However, court documents show that both Schatt and Podulka falsely assured their customers of the safety and collateralization of their funds. Rather than engaging in secure lending practices, a significant portion of Cred’s assets was poured into a single entity, MoKredit, a Chinese micro-lender specializing in unsecured loans to gamers. The accused Cred executives never disclosed to their customers that most of their assets were being sent to a microlender. The executives were warned about the company’s solvency, but they continued to assure customers of Cred’s financial stability, encouraging further investments and discouraging withdrawals. Executives face legal action for misleading investors District Judge William Alsup accepted the plea deals from both former executives and set a sentencing hearing for August 26, 2025. Both of them are facing up to 20 years in prison and $250K in fines for each count of wire fraud. Schatt and Podulka are facing 13 charges of wire fraud and money laundering. Law360 reported that as a term in the plea agreement, Schatt and Podulka were required to admit that they selectively presented positive “information [while] failing to disclose negative news” with the intent to “induce customers to lend their US currency and digital currencies to Cred.” Federal prosecutors have sent in a list of possible sentences for the two in the range of up to 72 months for Schatt and up to 62 months for Podulka. Cred’s former chief commercial officer, James Alexander, is also facing charges of wire fraud and money laundering. When Cred collapsed and filed for bankruptcy, its customers suffered losses of up to $150M, but the U.S. Department of Justice stated in May 2024 that the assets had a market value that exceeded $783M. Cred allegedly claimed to only engage in collateralized lending and that all its crypto investments were safe, which prosecutors say was false. According to the prosecutors, after the price of Bitcoin dropped by 40% on March 11, 2020, Cred could not meet its margin calls and neared insolvency. Yet, the three executives tried to attract new customers while being dishonest about the risks. Also, as a part of the plea agreement, the defendants agreed that their actions led to losses of between $65M and $150M for their investors.

There are several factors that have contributed to Bitcoin’s recent run. For starters, the CBOE Volatility Index is now down to just under 20. Also known as the fear index, the CBOE measures the expected volatility in markets for the next 30 days. A lower VIX shows less expected volatility and signs of stability. Earlier in the year, the VIX stood at just under 60, representing high uncertainty. However, it’s now come down to a 30-year average of just 20. The recent de-escalation in the ongoing US-China tariff war has also played a major role in strengthening Bitcoin above $100K. The US has agreed to tariffs of 30%, whereas China will now only impose a 10% tariff on US goods. This has led to ‘risk on’ sentiment when it comes to Bitcoin investors. Keep reading as we dig into various technical reasons that point towards an even greener crypto market in the coming weeks. We’ll also recommend three tokens that could be the next crypto to 1,000x if the market remains this bullish. Bitcoin ‘Risk-On’ Sentiments The US CPI inflation rate has also dropped to 2.3% YOY in April 2025, down 0.1% compared to March. This is the lowest it has been since February 2021. Slowing inflation indicates stable economic conditions, supporting the ‘risk-on’ environment for Bitcoin. Data from CryptoQuant shows that the Bitcoin Bull Score Index has increased from 20 to 80. While a score of 22-50 indicates neutral to slightly bullish conditions, a score above 80 indicates that Bitcoin is extremely bullish with strong rallies. Historically, whenever the Bull Score Index has hit 80, it has been followed by strong market rallies. What’s more, the Bitcoin fear-greed index is also moving up. It now stands at 53.3%. Although you could argue that this is slightly higher, it’s still quite far from the overload zone at 80%. All these positive market sentiments suggest that Bitcoin may soon break its all-time high and head towards the highly anticipated $135K level. Trump’s Promise Confirms Bullish Bias Speaking at the Saudi-US investment forum, Trump said that the markets are going to go a lot higher from here. He said that a lot of investment is happening, and jobs are being created at a pace never seen before. This will propel the equity markets to a new high. The magic may also pass on to Bitcoin, which has become a ‘safe-haven’ investment for corporations. Speaking of $BTC-loving corporations, Strategy has stashed over 550K $BTC so far. Semler Scientific has also purchased 1,510 $BTC since the beginning of 2025, taking its total holdings to 3,808 $BTC . Similarly, Twenty One Capital, an investment vehicle backed by Cantor Fitzgerald, now holds a total of 36,312 $BTC. This is after Tether recently bought $458.7M worth of $BTC for the firm. We continue to accretively grow our Bitcoin arsenal using operating cash flow and proceeds from debt and equity financings. – Eric Semler, chairman of Semler Scientific As is pretty evident, there is an increasing push by corporations to convert part of their cash reserves into Bitcoin. With strong technical indicators and market confidence, Bitcoin looks well poised to reach $135K. If you don’t want to miss out on this once-in-a-lifetime bull run, here are a few cryptos worth investing in . 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Bitcoin-Themed Altcoin to Buy Right Now BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is undoubtedly one of the frontrunners to become the next big crypto coin , thanks to its unique way of rooting for Bitcoin. It’s, in fact, the ONLY crypto today offering free (and 100% real) $BTC in its airdrops to its token holders. This is huge not only because $BTC is essentially worth $100K+ but also because it’s flipping the script on how crypto projects have typically gone about their airdrops, i.e., by offering more of their own tokens for free. BTC Bull Token’s Bitcoin airdrops will occur each time the king cryptocurrency breaches a new landmark figure, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K. To take part, you need to hold your $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet . More good news for $BTCBULL investors: the project will follow a deflationary model. Under this, a handful of $BTCBULL tokens will be erased from the total supply at regular intervals. As supply shrinks and $BTC marches on, we can expect $BTCBULL to absolutely explode. It’s worth noting that according to our BTC Bull Token price prediction , this new crypto could easily reach $0.096 by 2026. Looking to buy $BTCBULL ? Each token costs just $0.00251, and the project has already raised over $5.7M. 2. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) – Revolutionary New Crypto Changing the Online Creator Industry SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) sets itself apart by being the first-ever crypto subscription platform to integrate AI. It’s a beacon of hope for the $85B digital content industry that has been struggling with high commissions, little to no automation, and dying creator-fan relationships. Creators on SUBBD will have a slew of AI tools, such as voice, image, and video generators, to upscale and automate the entire process of creating and distributing content. In addition to benefiting from lower platform fees, they’ll also have the liberty to set up various payment models for their content. These include pay-per-view, subscriptions, tipping, and NFT sales. As for the fans, they’ll be able to use $SUBBD, the platform’s native token, to pay for all the exclusive content available on SUBBD. In addition to access to premium AI content, $SUBBD token holders will also get discounts on subscriptions and content, early-bird access to new features, and voting rights. Combined with a staking program that gives token holders access to exclusive creator livestreams, daily BTS drops, and a fixed APY of 20%, it’s not a surprise that our $SUBBD price prediction found the token could jump 1,200% by 2026. Buy the $SUBBD presale token today for just $0.0554 each. The project has so far raised over $390K in early investor funding. 3. Just a chill guy ($CHILLGUY) – Amusing Meme Coin on a Roll Right Now What do you call a person who diligently hustles as a taxi driver in GTA V? Stupid? Depressed? Nah; we’d say they’re ‘Just a chill guy.’ The GTA V example perfectly explains what this extraordinarily viral meme stands for – a ‘lowkey,’ ‘whatever’ attitude that doesn’t care about what anyone thinks. The meme character is quite dashing, too. He dons blue jeans, red shoes, and a grey sweater, all of which, by the way, pale in comparison to the coolness with which he keeps his hands in his pockets and boasts a smirk on his face. Needless to say, this is exactly the kind of meme crypto degens love to back. As a result, there’s nothing ‘chill’ about $CHILLGUY’s performance. The token is up over 130% in the last seven days and a brain-melting 460% in the last month or so. Plus, given that it’s still available for just $0.1140, Just a chill guy is easily one of the best cryptos to buy now . The Next Crypto to 1,000X – A Real Possibility or a Pipe Dream? There’s no refuting that top altcoins like $BTCBULL and $SUBBD have the potential to generate massive gains. However, they, like much of the altcoin space, depend on the broader crypto market’s pace and direction. Even though things, as they stand now, look bright, really bad news could send prices crashing any minute. So, despite the bullishness, we suggest that you only invest an amount you’re comfortable losing.

The TOMI token’s ( TOMI ) massive pump, which has the crypto trading 150% higher, also comes with a 446% spike in intraday volume to $26 million. It’s largely a drop in the $3.3 trillion crypto market, which has seen more than $149 billion traded in the last 24 hours. However, TOMI’s gains stand out, as the project’s uptick sees it rank as one of the biggest performers of the day. Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) recent march above $105,000 and Ethereum’s ( ETH ) surge to $2,700 continue to dominate overall chatter across crypto. The tailwinds from this surge, helped by macroeconomic factors, are driving most altcoins, as traders aggressively position. TOMI’s price appears to be gaining upside strength from this broader market movement. However, the web3-focused project has attracted notable attention since releasing its roadmap for a TOMI superapp earlier this year.

The TOMI app also features wallet integration and creator monetization. Encrypted private chats, a privacy-focused decentralized browser and mini apps is part of the project’s roadmap. Despite recent gains, TOMI crypto remains 99% down since its all-time high of $7.13 reached in June 2023. The token, co-founded by Moshe Hogeg , crashed to a low of $0.001187 on May 7, 2025.

AI is slowly taking over the DeFi space. On Wednesday, May 14, Binance Research released a report on the future of AI agents in DeFi. The report specifically discusses DeFAI, or AI agents that can interact autonomously with DeFi protocols. “DeFi has long served as the most prominent and enduring real-world use case for blockchain technology. It provides a programmable, permissionless financial layer that has facilitated everything from lending markets to decentralized exchanges,” Binance Research. These agents are able to trade, allocate liquidity, and even participate in DAO votes—all with minimal human oversight. According to Binance Research, this aligns with a major goal of blockchain: facilitating capital markets without intermediaries. “In this context, DeFAI — the application of autonomous AI agents to DeFi systems — represents not just another innovation, but a continuation of crypto’s most credible value proposition: disintermediated financial infrastructure,” Binance Research. DeFAI agents are rapidly gaining traction Agents are now able to automate complex DeFi tasks that previously required manual intervention by traders. This includes managing liquidity, navigating cross-chain bridges, and adopting various trading strategies. They can also help address DAO voter apathy by automatically voting based on a user’s preferences.

This includes not only trading agents but also agents involved in consumer support, analytics, automation, and more. Still, this technology also exposes the blockchain industry to certain risks, particularly in DAO governance. Whales and bad actors could leverage these agents to spam proposals, manipulate quorums, and collude. This has the potential to lead to centralization within DeFi protocols.

Former U.S. House Financial Services Committee Chairman Patrick McHenry said Gensler was not specifically against cryptocurrencies. Noting that Gensler's stance on cryptocurrencies is very different from his private life, McHenry said his public stance stems from political concerns. McHenry noted in an interview with Crypto in America host Eleanor Terrett that Gary Gensler is less anti-crypto in private than he is in public. McHenry was asked if Gensler was truly against crypto, or was he just as against it in private as he was in public? McHenry suggested in a recent post by Terrett on X that Gensler’s public stance was influenced by Senate politics and confirmation dynamics. “No… No. “I think Gensler's public stance on cryptocurrencies has more to do with Senate politics and confirmation politics.” During Gensler's tenure, which began in 2021 and ends in January 2025, the SEC took an aggressive regulatory stance against cryptocurrencies.

All three major South Korean presidential candidates support #Bitcoin ETFs and institutional investment. Currently, Bitcoin ETFs and institutional investments are banned in Korea. 100% volume comes from retail. pic.twitter.com/hL6cKci5VK — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) May 14, 2025 This marks the first time a South Korean presidential race has placed digital assets at the forefront of policy pledges, reflecting the growing influence of retail crypto investors and aligning with global trends led by U.S. regulatory shifts. South Korea Bans Institutional Investment in Crypto South Korea currently bans institutional investment in cryptocurrencies, and Bitcoin ETFs remain off-limits. As a result, the nation’s crypto trading volume comes entirely from retail investors. However, the rising popularity of digital assets among the youth and the middle class appears to be shaping the candidates’ platforms. Lee Jae-myung, the Democratic Party of Korea candidate, and Kim Moon-soo of the conservative People Power Party, have both released forward-looking pledges targeting crypto-savvy demographics. Lee announced on Facebook that he would introduce virtual asset spot ETFs and establish an integrated monitoring system to protect investors. He also promised to reduce transaction fees, making digital asset trading more accessible to young Koreans looking to build wealth. Kim Moon-soo echoed similar sentiments, embedding the launch of virtual asset ETFs into his “Middle Class Asset Increase Project,” a key component of his campaign. His pledge seeks to broaden the investment options for the middle class by legitimizing institutional access to the crypto market. This policy convergence among the top candidates reflects not just domestic investor demands but also global momentum. With the U.S. aggressively advancing its digital asset framework under the current administration, South Korean leaders appear eager to modernize financial regulations and avoid falling behind. As the local virtual asset investor base continues to grow, South Korea’s political establishment is finally responding. If any of these candidates follow through post-election, the nation could see a policy overhaul—one that opens the door to Bitcoin ETFs and institutional investment, transforming Korea from a retail-driven market to a global crypto hub. South Korea’s Digital Asset Committee Redefines Crypto Regulation South Korea jolted its presidential race on May 13 when the Democratic Party unveiled a Digital Asset Committee, vowing to pull crypto regulation straight into the next president’s office. The committee, formed under the party’s election campaign arm, held its first meeting on Tuesday at the National Assembly Members’ Hall in Seoul. Local news agency, News1, reported that the initiative comes as digital assets emerge as a key issue in the upcoming presidential election. The committee will play a central role in drafting pledges, driving legislation, and building frameworks for digital assets, with early discussions focused on the Basic Digital Asset Act, known as the “Stage 2 Bill.” The post CryptoQuant: South Korea’s Three Presidential Front-Runners Embrace Crypto – Policy Shift Ahead? appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|Crypto Regulation News|News|CryptoQuant|Presidential Elections|South Korea,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-05-14 16:13:13

Here’s the Latest,https://timestabloid.com/banks-can-now-play-with-xrp-and-crypto-heres-the-latest/,"The rapidly evolving landscape of cryptocurrency regulations has taken a significant leap forward. In a recent post on X, Vincent Van Code highlighted that banks are now positioned to engage in digital asset activities, including utilizing XRP . The announcement comes as the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) clarifies the permissible involvement of national banks in cryptocurrency transactions. OCC’s Landmark Clarification The statement from the OCC, led by Acting Comptroller Rodney E. Hood, marks a pivotal moment for digital asset integration into the traditional banking sector. Hood emphasized that over 50 million Americans currently hold some form of cryptocurrency, signifying the transformative shift in financial services rather than a mere trend. This perspective underscores the substantial role that digital assets, including XRP, now play in the financial ecosystem. Banks can now play with XRP and crypto. It's game on. https://t.co/gJhehiShIV — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) May 14, 2025 The OCC’s Interpretive Letters 1183 and 1184 clearly outline the circumstances under which national banks and federal savings associations can engage in crypto-related activities. These letters establish that institutions may participate in cryptocurrency operations as long as they maintain safe, sound, and fair practices. This nuanced approach allows regulated financial entities to participate in the digital economy without compromising their regulatory obligations. XRP: A Game Changer for Banks With this clarification, XRP’s position within the financial sector has been substantially reinforced. XRP, known for its ability to facilitate cross-border transactions quickly and cost-effectively, aligns with the OCC’s vision of integrating digital assets responsibly. Banks can leverage XRP’s efficiency to enhance liquidity management and streamline international payments, setting the stage for broader institutional adoption. The Broader Implications The OCC’s stance on digital assets not only legitimizes the use of cryptocurrencies like XRP in the banking system but also signals a broader acceptance of blockchain technology. This transformation suggests that traditional financial institutions are increasingly acknowledging the need to integrate crypto solutions into their service offerings. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 As financial institutions explore new avenues within the crypto space, the ripple effect on the global economy could be profound. The ability to securely and transparently engage with digital assets may redefine how banks handle cross-border payments and liquidity solutions. Moreover, this development could encourage further innovation in blockchain-based financial products. Final Thoughts The OCC’s progressive stance marks a critical turning point for digital assets in the regulated financial space. As banks begin to embrace cryptocurrencies like XRP, the financial landscape is poised for unprecedented change. The move not only reflects growing acceptance but also sets a precedent for the future of digital finance. Vincent Van Code’s insight into this development underscores the excitement and potential that lie ahead. As the global financial system continues to evolve, XRP’s role in bridging traditional and digital economies becomes increasingly apparent.

The broader crypto market briefly rallied to an intraday high of $3.52 trillion before pulling back to stabilise around $3.46 trillion by late Asian trading hours. Market sentiment, as measured by the benchmark Crypto Fear and Greed Index, improved following cooling inflation data. At press time, the index stood at 73, firmly in greed territory. Yet, altcoins had a slow day, with most tokens shedding some of their weekend gains, while a handful of top altcoins managed to stay in the green. Why is Bitcoin stuck? Bitcoin’s climb to a daily high of $104,836 came on the back of fresh macroeconomic optimism, led by cooling inflation data that lifted market sentiment. April’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed inflation easing to 2.3% year-on-year, coming in softer than expected and giving traders a reason to breathe. With the reading well within the Federal Reserve’s comfort zone, expectations of further rate hikes receded, fuelling demand for risk assets like Bitcoin. Adding fuel to the fire was a breakthrough in US-China trade relations. Over the weekend, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice President He Lifeng signed a tariff-reduction deal in Geneva, slashing reciprocal tariff rates to 10% from punishing highs of 145% and 125%. The agreement officially takes effect today, May 14, kicking off an initial 90-day window of lowered tariffs. It marks a turning point after a prolonged period of economic tension, sparking renewed confidence among investors. Yet, despite these tailwinds, Bitcoin has remained stuck below the $104,000 mark. The rally lost steam as profit-taking emerged at key resistance levels. Santiment’s Realized Profit/Loss metric spiked on Tuesday, indicating that many holders are securing gains, increasing short-term selling pressure, and capping upside momentum. Will Bitcoin go up? Some market trends suggest Bitcoin could still break higher if macro and on-chain dynamics align. On-chain data points to a tightening supply backdrop. According to analyst Miles Deutscher, the supply of Bitcoin on exchanges has dropped to just 14%, a seven-year low.

One key momentum indicator has now flipped bullish, adding weight to the case for a breakout. Bitcoin’s weekly MACD histogram has crossed above zero, signalling a shift from bearish to bullish momentum. It’s the first time this has happened since late October, just before BTC began its run to new all-time highs. As can be seen from the chart below, the last five bullish MACD flips led to significant upside, with only one false signal in March 2022. The latest crossover also follows BTC’s bounce off the 50-week moving average, another setup that previously marked strong moves higher. BTC/USD weekly chart. Source: TradingView. Based on this setup alone, trader Sensei speculated a long-term price target of $250,000.

Roman, a crypto trader known for his macro calls, believes the current range-bound action could mark a continuation of the trend, provided Bitcoin consolidates above $103,000. In his view, a break above $108,000 could open the door to $120,000 in the near term. Meanwhile, fellow analyst Hardy is eyeing a potential retest of the $98,000 zone as a more attractive entry point. He noted this level aligns with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement zone from the recent leg up, often viewed as a key area of support during bullish trends. BTC/USD daily chart. Source: Hardy Others are looking beyond short-term levels and drawing parallels to previous market cycles. Crypto analyst Moustache pointed to a repeating parabolic structure that has historically preceded major Bitcoin rallies. In his view, BTC is currently retesting a multi-month trendline, just as it did in 2017 and 2020 before going vertical. He suggested that if history repeats, a parabolic curve could follow, with Bitcoin entering a steep acceleration phase similar to past cycle tops. However, pseudonymous trader Byzantine General did not rule out the possibility of Bitcoin moving sideways in the near term. “If BTC remains calm, then alts can do their own thing for a bit,” the analyst noted, suggesting that stability in Bitcoin could allow capital to rotate into the broader market. For now, Bitcoin bulls need to break past the $104,000 resistance for the current rally to continue in the absence of any immediate catalysts. At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $103,465, down 0.6% on the day. Slow day for altcoins Over the past 24 hours, the altcoin market cap saw a small bump of 1.78%, bringing it close to $1.43 trillion. Despite the gains, the Altcoin Season Index is still sitting at 30, which means Bitcoin is still leading the market and largely steering where altcoins go from here. Ethereum (ETH), the largest altcoin by market cap, briefly touched a little above $2,700 but later settled at around $2,578, roughly a 1% gain from the previous day. Other top altcoins like XRP, Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), and Tron (TRX) also saw minor gains between 0.5% and 3%. Raydium (RAY) stood out with the biggest gains of the day, rising 12.6%. It was followed by Walrus (WAL), which climbed 9.7%, and Pi (PI), which rose 7.4%. Source: CoinMarketCap According to the well-followed analyst, Gordon, we’re now in the second phase of the Altseason cycle. Eventually, true Altseason kicks in when money starts flowing into mid- and low-cap coins, even the ones with weak fundamentals, with the large-cap tokens still managing to outshine both BTC and ETH. Trader Michaël van de Poppe also shared that the altcoin market cap, excluding BTC and ETH, has climbed to around $925 billion. He believes the market may go through a short consolidation phase before kicking off a new Altseason. Interestingly, one market watcher thinks the next big Altseason might actually begin tomorrow, May 15. He’s basing this on past cycles, pointing out that major altcoin rallies happened around this same date in 2017 and 2021, both four years apart. According to his chart, altcoin traders could witness a similar rally this time, with the total altcoin market cap potentially climbing as much as 225% from current levels.

The report concluded that Bitcoin has a strong negative correlation with equities in the short term, but that the correlation differs over longer time horizons. Whereas a true hedge would have a correlation of less than -0.3, RedStone’s 30-day analysis shows Bitcoin’s correlation with the S&P 500 moving between -0.2 and 0.4—too unstable for dependable counter-movement during periods of market stress. Bitcoin’s Strong Point is Diversification Even if it doesn’t make it as a hedge, Bitcoin provides enormous value as a portfolio diversifier. The cryptocurrency’s active price movement can provide upside potential when other assets fare poorly. “Even a small 1–5% Bitcoin allocation can greatly enhance a portfolio’s risk-adjusted returns,” said Marcin Kazmierczak, RedStone co-founder and COO. He noted that Bitcoin has delivered over 230% annualized return over the past five years, outperforming the performance of traditional equities and safe-haven assets. BTC Maturity Tied to Institutional Adoption In Kazmierczak’s opinion, Bitcoin must “mature” further to delink from stock markets and serve as a good hedge. “More institutional adoption will certainly help,” he said, referring to the impact of corporate treasury investments and endorsements by firms like BlackRock in reducing Bitcoin’s volatility. Recent statistics affirm this trend. Bitcoin weekly volatility hit a 563-day low on April 30. In early May, its realized volatility dipped below that of the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100, reflecting a shift in investor attitude towards Bitcoin as a long-term investment vehicle. Conclusion Bitcoin is not yet the safe-haven asset that some investors hope for, but its maturation into lower volatility and broader acceptance is causing it to be a high-performing component of diversified investment portfolios. As its institutional acceptance grows, so too may its ability to behave more like traditional financial assets—delivering both resilience and return.",Bitcoin|Blockchain,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-05-14 17:04:00

The token has seen a significant rally from the recent all-time low of $0.2484 on April 7, setting the stage for a recovery rally now amplified by the MiniPay debut. Investors are interpreting MiniPay’s availability on both major mobile platforms as a catalyst for increased Celo on-chain activity. MiniPay’s features drive adoption MiniPay, a lightweight Celo-based stablecoin wallet, offers sub-cent transaction fees and instant transfers for under $0.01, making it highly appealing to everyday users. Users can now sign up without dealing with seed phrases or crypto complexity, simply using their phone number and a Google or iCloud account for seamless onboarding. The Pockets feature, developed in partnership with Mento Labs, enables free swaps between stablecoins like cUSD, USDT, and USDC, further bolstering user engagement. By leveraging Mento’s algorithmic stablecoin framework, MiniPay ensures deep liquidity and minimal slippage across supported tokens. By embedding stablecoin support directly within a mobile-first interface, MiniPay removes barriers that have historically hindered mainstream crypto adoption. Impact on Celo’s market metrics Following the launch of MiniPay on iOS and Android, Celo’s market cap climbed to approximately $250.66 million as trading volume surged past $28.7 million in 24 hours, although the two metrics have since dropped slightly. The total value locked (TVL) on Celo’s network has also seen an uptick to $95.47 million, driven by increased stablecoin flows through MiniPay’s infrastructure. Amidst the newfound demand, the circulating supply of 570.65 million tokens and a max supply of one billion indicate healthy tokenomics. Outlook for Celo and MiniPay With over seven million unique wallets already onboarded and growing adoption as a standalone app, MiniPay’s launch is set to fuel further network effects for Celo. The combination of a user-friendly interface, real-world stablecoin use cases, and strategic partnerships positions Celo for sustained growth in the coming months. As global remittance volumes continue to climb, MiniPay’s ability to offer instant, low-cost dollar transfers may uplift Celo’s market standing. Looking ahead, continued enhancements to the Mini Apps ecosystem and deeper integrations with local payment providers are likely to reinforce Celo’s mission of financial inclusion. Ultimately, the resurgence in Celo price reflects not only technical market factors but also the tangible impact of MiniPay’s launch, illustrating how product innovation can reignite bullish momentum in blockchain ecosystems.

This surge in the value of the second-largest cryptocurrency comes amid aggressive accumulation from market participants and declining sell-side pressure. ETH Records Large Exchange Withdrawals According to a tweet by the institutional-grade decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Sentora (previously IntoTheBlock), ether has witnessed an intense and sustained trend of net outflows from centralized exchanges since the beginning of the month. Ethereum investors have withdrawn more than $1.2 billion worth of ETH from trading platforms within the last seven days. This happened just as ETH recorded a 52% rally in its price, jumping from less than $1,800 to at least $2,730. Massive accumulation trends like this often signal that investors are moving their assets off exchanges to hold in the long term, hoping for significant price appreciation. ETH has remained dormant for most of this bull cycle, and this has caused investors and market participants to dismiss its bullish potential for this season. However, the asset’s sudden breakout from a resistance zone that has held it down for months triggered a shift in market sentiment. Investor sentiment moved from fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) due to ether’s underperformance to the fear of missing out (FOMO) as traders scrambled for entry points amid the rally. As more traders try to get into the market, demand for ETH will increase. With sell-side pressure decreasing amid massive withdrawals from exchanges, ETH is bound to experience higher surges in the near term. Most ETH Holders in Profit Ether’s ongoing price appreciation has increased the percentage of addresses holding the cryptocurrency in profit to more than 60%. This is a significant development compared to 32% of addresses in profit roughly a month ago. While most analysts believe ether’s rally is not just the result of a short squeeze, others have warned that the asset could consolidate between $2,400 and $2,700 before its next leg up. Nevertheless, on-chain analyst Ali Martinez has identified the range between $2,060 and $2,420 as the most crucial support floor for ETH. Here, there are 10 million wallets holding more than 69 million ETH.

Pi Coin ( PI ) dropped to $1.06, down more than 35% from its highest point this week. This decline brought its market capitalization to $7.5 billion, down from a high of over $10 billion earlier in the week. The coin dropped after the developers launched Pi Network Ventures , a $100 million fund to invest in startups leveraging its technology. The goal is to build a thriving ecosystem of applications in industries like retail and finance. First, following the announcement of the ecosystem fund, the price of Pi Coin fell due to a phenomenon known as “buying the rumor and selling the news.” This occurs when investors buy an asset ahead of a major event and then sell when the news becomes public. You might also like: Pi Network price doubles in a week — will the May 14 update push it higher? In Pi Network’s case, the token surged nearly 200% when the developers hinted at the upcoming news. This same dynamic also explains why the Official Trump ( TRUMP ) meme coin could decline after the exclusive dinner . Second, Pi Coin’s price dropped because the ecosystem fund won’t have an immediate impact on the token. For one, it will take months before funded projects begin deploying on the network. Additionally, there’s no guarantee that these projects will gain meaningful traction among users. Pi Network ecosystem fund fell short of expectations Third, the announcement fell short of what many Pi Network investors were expecting. Much of the speculation centered around a potential exchange listing with one or more tier-1 platforms like Coinbase, Binance, or HTX. Such a listing would likely have had a bullish impact on the token by providing access to millions of potential traders. A Pi Network token burn would also have been well received, as tokenomics remains one of the biggest concerns among investors. Many holders are wary of the 1.468 billion tokens expected to enter circulation over the next 12 months. A burn would have helped offset this looming supply increase.

Crackdowns by Gensler stunted U.S. crypto growth while rival nations advanced. The new SEC team now pushes for clearer regulations with industry input. Former House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry revealed on May 13 that Gary Gensler privately called crypto “valuable,” while publicly cracking down as SEC chair. Under his leadership, the SEC unleashed over 100 enforcement actions that stalled U.S. innovation. The Gensler Paradox: Private Crypto Advocate, Public Regulator The revelation came during McHenry’s interview on the Crypto in America podcast. “He saw the value of crypto assets,” McHenry stated, a stark contrast to Gensler’s public warnings about investor risks and his aggressive enforcement record. SCOOP: @PatrickMcHenry reveals that former SEC chief Gary Gensler was not as anti-crypto in private as he was in public. “I think it had more to do with Senate politics, and confirmation politics.” Full episode with the former Chair of @FinancialCmte out tomorrow AM! pic.twitter.com/BHw7pRlRKG — Crypto In America (@CryptoAmerica_) May 14, 2025 Political realities shaped this disconnect. According to McHenry, Senate confirmation pressures and Washington politics drove Gensler’s hardline public narrative. Gary Gensler once inspired hope with his crypto credentials. The MIT blockchain lecturer had even explored token airdrops—expertise that suggested balanced SEC leadership. Instead, his tenure became defined by contradiction. Behind closed doors, Gensler recognized crypto’s potential, but publicly, his SEC became an enforcement machine, bringing over 100 actions against industry players. This regulatory whiplash left developers confused and institutions wary, with analysts also saying that the gap between his words and actions created damaging uncertainty. The backlash has been swift since Gensler’s January 2025 return to MIT. For example, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong took the extraordinary step of promising to sever ties with law firms that employed ex-SEC enforcement staff , calling their actions “unlawful overreach.” We've let all the law firms we work with know, that if they hire anyone who committed these bad deeds in the (soon to be) prior administration, we will no longer be a client of theirs. Senior partners at these law firms seem unaware of the crypto industry's position on this.… https://t.co/k8R6NtfTV1 pic.twitter.com/RT0k408i9f — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) December 3, 2024 Gemini escalated matters further, implementing a controversial hiring freeze on MIT graduates until the university severs ties with its former professor. Could CFTC Oversight Resolve the Crypto ETF Standoff? Yet Gensler’s legacy is ironic—his SEC greenlit spot Bitcoin ETFs in 2024, prompting Wall Street’s biggest crypto embrace. The approval, crypto’s biggest regulatory win, came from the chairman who otherwise constrained the industry at every turn. The agency approved spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 10, 2024, and spot Ether ETFs on July 23, 2024, after confirming both trade on deep, surveillance-shared markets where regulators can detect manipulation. Bitcoin’s clear commodity status and Ether’s evolving (but navigable) legal framework gave auditors and custodians a workable model. The SEC still rejected ETFs tied to thinly traded tokens, and enforcement actions uncovered wash-trading schemes and weak custody arrangements that could harm investors. Pressure from Washington furthered this regulatory divide. Congress voted to overturn SAB121 (which discouraged banks from holding crypto), though a presidential veto kept it intact until Trump’s return in January. FIT21 unlocks a conversation beyond innovation. It’s about national security, consumer protection & global competitiveness. It’s about shaping what the future global digital economy looks like and how it functions. Let's give Americans the clarity needed to seize this moment. pic.twitter.com/scdatvjyp5 — Tom Emmer (@GOPMajorityWhip) May 22, 2024 Lawmakers also advanced the FIT21 bill , shifting oversight of major tokens to the CFTC, a move the SEC warned could create dangerous gaps. By April 2025, the SEC approved Ether ETF options only after issuers proved robust safeguards. Meanwhile, dozens of other crypto-related ETF applications (including Solana and Dogecoin ETFs) remain under review, pending further regulatory clarity. Can a Crypto Task Force End Regulatory Whiplash? Less than a week after Gensler’s resignation as SEC chair, Acting Chairman Mark T. Uyeda launched a crypto task force to craft clear, comprehensive regulations for digital assets. The task force was empowered to use agency expertise and public feedback to establish clear registration pathways, disclosure standards, targeted enforcement, and even roundtable discussions with industry leaders. On May 12, in what would be the fourth such industry arrangement, SEC chair Paul Atkins doubled down on his commitment to clear crypto regulation during a roundtable session titled “Tokenization: Moving Assets Onchain: Where TradFi and DeFi Meet.” Chairman Paul Atkins' remarks at the Crypto Task Force roundtable on tokenization: The topic of this afternoon’s discussion is timely as securities are increasingly migrating from traditional (or “off-chain”) databases to blockchain-based (or “on-chain”) ledger systems. — U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (@SECGov) May 12, 2025 The event featured panelists Johann Kerbrat (Robinhood Crypto), Cynthia Lo Bessette (Fidelity Digital Asset Management), and Johnny Reinsch (Token Asset Coalition). Atkins vowed to establish “clear rules of the road for issuance, custody, and trading” of digital assets and to discourage bad actors through defined regulations rather than ad hoc enforcement. Market participants now expect Congress to push for clearer statutory guidance that aligns technocratic understanding with public messaging, hoping to end whiplash driven by courtesy of political theatre. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How did Gensler’s enforcement actions hurt the U.S. crypto market? Beyond legal costs, regulatory uncertainty slashed U.S. crypto venture funding by 38% during his tenure, while Europe and Asia saw growth (PitchBook data). Why did Wall Street support Gensler’s anti-crypto crackdown? Major banks quietly favored his tough stance, as it delayed crypto’s mainstream adoption, preserving their dominance in traditional finance.

Bitcoin dropped sharply below $62,000, triggering a chain reaction across long positions and forcing leveraged trades into losses. But as markets correct, some altcoins are moving countertrend—among them: Litecoin, Cronos, and the rising force that is Qubetics ($TICS). While Litecoin gained traction with a 13% price bump, and Cronos doubled down on ecosystem expansion, Qubetics is making waves for different reasons. The project is reframing how cross-border transactions happen across blockchain networks—its infrastructure focus and unique Web3 Aggregator model are backed by a rapidly accelerating presale. The presale, which is gaining speed with weekly 10% price increases, could point to Qubetics as one of the Best Altcoins to Invest in Now. Qubetics Bridges the Blockchain Divide for Cross-Border Utility Qubetics isn’t solving just one problem. It’s offering an entirely new backbone for how people and businesses interact with blockchain across borders. At the center of its solution is a cross-border transaction platform built to eliminate fragmentation. While current systems require juggling bridges, wallets, and sometimes centralized exchanges, Qubetics combines these layers into one ecosystem through its Web3 Aggregator. Let’s say a freelance designer in Toronto is billing a Singapore-based brand in Solana but needs to receive funds in BNB Chain for staking purposes. Normally, that’s a three-step process involving conversion fees, delays, and exposure to slippage. With Qubetics, this scenario becomes seamless: the sender pays in Solana, and the recipient settles in BNB—no third-party tools or time lags required. This application is just as powerful for small businesses. A boutique exporter in the EU working with Southeast Asian retailers can bypass FX volatility by invoicing in stablecoins native to multiple chains, while Qubetics’ system ensures instant cross-chain compatibility. These aren’t distant promises—they’re near-term solutions that help Qubetics stand apart among the Best Altcoins to Invest in Now . Qubetics Presale Gains Momentum with Weekly Price Increases—Best Altcoins to Invest in Now for ROI Potential? The Qubetics presale is currently in Stage 34, with the $TICS token priced at $0.2532. With over 512 million tokens sold, a growing base of 26,300+ token holders, and more than $17 million in funds raised, momentum is building fast. What’s pushing this presale forward isn’t just hype—it’s the mechanics. Each stage lasts exactly 7 days, and every Sunday at midnight, the price increases by 10%, without exception. This structure favors early participants who understand timing. The ROI math is especially compelling. If $TICS hits $1 post-presale, that means a 294.84% return. If it climbs to $5, it skyrockets to 1,874.21%. Should the token reach $10 after the Q2 2025 mainnet launch, early buyers would be staring at a 3,848.42% gain. A $15 price tag would translate to a stunning 5,822.63% ROI. Now, picture this: a $100 allocation at the current stage yields approximately 394.82 $TICS tokens. If Qubetics trades at $10, that modest sum becomes $3,948.20. At $15, the same $100 flips into $5,922.30. Given these numbers, it’s clear why many are calling it not just the Qubetics presale, but also the best crypto pre sale to monitor in 2025. These gains aren’t promised—they’re projected. But with a structured presale model, cross-chain real-world usage, and a locked-in launch timeline, Qubetics has a playbook few others match. It could realistically be one of the Best Altcoins to Invest in Now before its presale phases out. Litecoin Sees Renewed Price Activity—But Can It Keep Up with Qubetics’ Growth? According to Analytics Insight, Litecoin recently climbed 13%, becoming one of the few large-cap assets to show measurable growth amid broader market downturns. The increase coincides with growing confidence in Litecoin’s scalability and its position as a legacy proof-of-work network that offers faster transaction times and lower fees than Bitcoin. Analytics Insight points out that while Litecoin’s price performance is commendable, it lacks the narrative velocity that newer projects—like Qubetics—are currently riding. The article also hints that Litecoin’s role in the future may be more about stability than breakout growth, a trend seen often in mature Layer 1s. That said, Litecoin’s uptick shouldn’t be dismissed. It has consistently proven resilient through multiple market cycles. But when measured against more dynamic, ROI-oriented opportunities like Qubetics, the legacy coin faces steep competition in being ranked among the Best Altcoins to Invest in Now. Cronos Taps NFT, DeFi, and Gaming—But Will It Break Out in Time? Cronos is laying the groundwork for its next growth wave. A Binance Square update outlines Cronos’ major 2025 focus areas: NFT infrastructure, DeFi expansion, and blockchain gaming. The network is actively recruiting projects and teams to deploy on its EVM-compatible chain, and it’s beefing up its validator ecosystem to ensure scalability. The ecosystem strategy is gaining traction. Cronos now supports over 100 dApps, and the Cronos Accelerator is expanding its reach across Asia and the Middle East. According to the post, Cronos Labs will double its hackathons and developer grants in 2025—targeting a wave of onboarding never before seen on the chain. Still, the question remains: will Cronos’ broad approach be fast enough to capture breakout returns in the current market cycle? While its infrastructure and developer funding look strong, it may not deliver the short-term ROI promise that Qubetics presale buyers are betting on. For those seeking functional exposure to high-growth verticals, Cronos has potential—but it’s battling for mindshare among the Best Altcoins to Invest in Now. Final Take: Which of These Three Really Ranks Among the Best Altcoins to Invest in Now? Market shakeouts often reset the leaderboard. This latest $730M liquidation event has made one thing crystal clear—community members are reevaluating where the true growth lies. Litecoin’s 13% bump shows it’s not out of the race yet. Cronos is structuring for a massive ecosystem push, spanning NFTs to gaming. But only one of these three is combining structured ROI with real-world use cases and consistent momentum. Qubetics has already raised $17M, flipped through 34 presale stages, and issued 512M+ tokens to over 26,300 holders. Its weekly 10% price jump builds urgency, while its cross-border transaction platform speaks directly to actual pain points businesses and freelancers face today. It’s not just a crypto presale. It’s a presale with intent, structure, and a launch runway leading into Q2 2025. When comparing all three side-by-side, Qubetics holds the clearest edge in potential value creation. It may well be the best crypto pre sale on the table—and potentially the Best Altcoin to Invest in Now for those watching market patterns sharpen in real time. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What makes Qubetics one of the Best Altcoins to Invest in Now? Qubetics delivers real-world cross-border transaction utility, a structured presale model, and a roadmap targeting a Q2 2025 mainnet launch. How does the Qubetics presale work? Each presale stage lasts 7 days, ending every Sunday at midnight with a 10% price increase, offering better entry points to early buyers. What is the current price of Qubetics and how much has been raised? The current $TICS price is $0.2532. Over $17 million has been raised, with 512M+ tokens sold and 26,300+ token holders.

In a letter sent to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Reps. Gerald Connolly (D-Va.), Joe Morelle (D-N.Y.) and Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) — the ranking members of the House Oversight, Administrative, and Judiciary committees — called for an urgent investigation into Trump’s blockchain project World Liberty Financial and the $TRUMP memecoin, citing possible violations of campaign finance laws, bribery statutes and securities regulations. “The Committees seek to determine whether legislation is necessary to prevent violations of campaign finance, consumer protection, bribery, securities fraud, and other anti-corruption laws in connection with fundraising by candidates for federal office and federal officeholders and to guard against deceptive and predatory campaign fundraising practices, illicit foreign influence over federal officials, and other financial misconduct connected to prospective or current federal officials,” the leading Democrats on the committees wrote in a press release shared with CoinDesk. The request marks an escalation in congressional scrutiny on whether President Trump and his entourage are abusing their positions of power to benefit their crypto businesses. Senate Democrats pointed to Trump’s crypto ventures last week as part of their reason for not voting to advance stablecoin legislation that previously saw bipartisan support. The inquiry zeroes in not only on the Trump family’s September 2024 launch of World Liberty Financial and the $TRUMP memecoin launched just days before his inauguration, but also Elon Musk’s America PAC and whether they are using Trump’s name to solicit donations under false pretenses.

With an impressive 15% weekly price increase and trading volume exceeding $4 billion, Dogecoin remains a top contender in the cryptocurrency sphere. But while DOGE continues to evoke headlines, a new player, Ruvi, could be destined to surpass its success. Ruvi, a blockchain-powered ecosystem infused with advanced artificial intelligence (AI), is presenting itself as the future of cryptocurrency. With a presale price set at a tantalizing $0.01 per token, Ruvi offers early investors the golden opportunity to claim unprecedented gains. Now, as Dogecoin rides the waves of community enthusiasm, could Ruvi emerge as the next disruptive force in crypto? Dogecoin’s rise and its staying power Dogecoin has proven that cultural influence, meme-driven hype, and an avid community can fuel massive growth. Its low transaction fees and fast settlement times make it practical for tipping, payments, and lighthearted transactions. The community, lovingly dubbed the “Dogefam,” has rallied behind initiatives ranging from sponsorships to viral campaigns, cementing DOGE’s status as more than a mere meme. However, Dogecoin faces challenges, such as an inflationary supply model, which can slow long-term value acquisition. With millions of DOGE being mined annually, the asset remains highly speculative, relying more on social momentum than intrinsic utility. This opens the door for innovative newcomers like Ruvi to seize opportunities by addressing gaps in utility and long-term scalability. Why Ruvi deserves your attention Ruvi takes blockchain innovation to the next level. It pairs decentralized technology with AI-powered tools, transforming how industries like logistics, healthcare, and digital media operate. By enabling predictive analytics, automated workflows, and custom smart contracts, Ruvi is built to do what Dogecoin never aspired to accomplish. At its core lies the $RUVI token, with a capped supply of 5 billion, ensuring scarcity and sustainable growth. Investors enjoy peace of mind thanks to Ruvi’s deflationary tokenomics that steadily increase value through controlled supply mechanisms. What really sets Ruvi apart is its unique integration of AI, helping businesses make smarter decisions while facilitating seamless operational automation. With such versatility, Ruvi stands poised to become a dominant player across multiple high-demand industries. How to get ahead with Ruvi Much like the early DOGE believers, Ruvi investors can capitalize on its presale phase. Special bonus incentives make this the ideal time to secure an oversized stake in Ruvi’s future. Here’s what different investment levels look like: Entry level – $500 For $500, investors receive 50,000 Ruvi tokens. A 40% bonus adds an extra 20,000 tokens, totaling 70,000 tokens. Should Ruvi achieve $2 per token, this seeds a $140,000 valuation. Mid level – $1,500 A $1,500 investment secures 150,000 tokens. With a 60% bonus, you gain an extra 90,000 tokens, bringing the total to 240,000 tokens. At $3 per token, this turns into $720,000! High level – $5,000 Serious investors staking $5,000 receive 500,000 tokens, which effectively double to 1,000,000 tokens thanks to a 100% bonus. Should Ruvi climb to $4, the payoff becomes a staggering $4 million. Can Ruvi rival Dogecoin’s community magic? Dogecoin’s die-hard community gives it a unique edge. But Ruvi adds an extra layer of attraction, pairing technical innovation with broad industrial application. While DOGE thrives on social buzz, Ruvi delivers tangible real-world benefits. Both tokens are community-driven in nature, but Ruvi’s practical utility ensures it goes beyond fleeting excitement. Early backers of Ruvi aren’t just buying tokens; they’re investing in a next-gen digital solution that bridges AI with blockchain functionality. This next step in decentralized innovation equips Ruvi to capture global markets in ways Dogecoin never envisioned. Act now to secure the future Dogecoin’s enduring momentum reminds us that early movers reap the greatest rewards in crypto. Ruvi’s presale aligns with this principle, offering a low-cost entry point that could yield astronomic returns. But time is running out to get in ahead of the herd. Secure your $RUVI tokens now and join a community poised to redefine industries with blockchain-AI integration. The opportunity to change the game is here. Will you grab it?

It’s tied to a working revenue model, real-time user incentives, and a clear launch strategy that positions MUTM for strong early adoption. For investors eyeing smart allocations under $0.15, this DeFi crypto token is emerging as a serious contender for those looking for the best crypto to buy now. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) At its core, Mutuum Finance is more than a token — it’s a decentralized ecosystem where users can deposit digital assets to earn yield or access liquidity without giving up ownership. Loans are secured through overcollateralization, and depositors receive mtTokens, which gain value over time as interest is collected from borrowers. Unlike hype-driven projects, MUTM is built to operate right from the moment it lists. A beta version of the platform will go live when the token launches, giving users direct access to its earning and borrowing tools from day one — a practical model that appeals to those seeking real-world crypto investment opportunities. Analysts following presale movements and token distribution mechanics note that the project has already raised over $8 million, with nearly 10,000 investors on board. But what’s drawing attention now is the tight feedback loop built into its token model. Part of the protocol’s revenue from lending operations is allocated to purchasing MUTM tokens on the open market, which are subsequently distributed to mtToken holders. This creates ongoing demand that isn’t based on speculation but tied directly to usage, making it a standout among the best DeFi crypto projects currently in presale. With the token price currently sitting at $0.025 and the next phase set to increase it to $0.03, many see the entry window narrowing. Projections that place the token at $1.50 post-launch represent a 5,900% gain — an estimate gaining traction among those focused on early-stage cryptocurrency investment opportunities with real yield structures. The fourth presale phase is now over 73% complete, and with each new round, the price climbs closer to the $0.06 launch value. But it’s not just about the incremental gains between phases — it’s the potential jump that comes after MUTM hits exchanges with an operational product behind it. Those entering now aren’t just betting on a chart movement — they’re buying into a system already producing value through borrowing activity and structured income redistribution, making it a compelling cryptocurrency to invest in before the wider market takes notice. When MUTM climbs to $1.50 as forecasted, a $1,200 investment at the current presale price would turn into $72,000. Those returns are driven by mechanics — not marketing alone. For those looking for the best crypto to buy now under $0.15, it’s one of the rare tokens with actual upside mapped to a working system. All interactions within Mutuum Finance will operate through audited smart contracts, with the team undergoing a full security review by CertiK. This level of scrutiny has become a minimum requirement for investors allocating larger capital amounts, especially as attention shifts to real use cases in the DeFi space. Users won’t need to wait months to see traction — they’ll be able to engage with the protocol from day one, tracking yield, loan metrics, and token distribution on-chain. As the broader market recovers and new cycles form, many investors are rethinking their approach. Rather than chasing after overbought assets, they’re scouting for low-priced tokens tied to practical use and scalable revenue. That’s exactly where MUTM fits in. With a token price still well below $0.15, rising demand, and a system built to support value through real economic activity, Mutuum Finance stands out as one of the top cryptocurrency opportunities heading into 2025.

Rasul made the remarks during a panel on May 13 at the Blockchain Futurist Conference in Toronto, pointing to Europe's crypto regulatory framework as a model for Canada to consider: “I’m sure the regulators are wondering if this was the right choice to approach stablecoins as a security. I would just say, look at MiCA, look at the way they’re approaching stablecoins. It’s a payment instrument. It should be regulated as such.” The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) classified stablecoins as “securities and/or derivatives” in December 2022, following “recent events in the crypto market,” such as the dramatic collapse of crypto exchange FTX just a month before.

Currently priced at just $0.025, MUTM is attracting investors seeking low-risk, high-reward opportunities in the DeFi market. Over $8.1 million has been raised in its presale, indicating strong investor confidence. The project is in phase 4 of its presale which has already sold over 70% and attracted more than 9800 unique holders. Analysts suggest that unlike SHIB’s hype-driven narrative, MUTM is backed by unique utility features and a focused roadmap that could propel it to an eye-watering 80x surge within just eight weeks. As traders look beyond nostalgia-driven tokens and seek out real innovation in undervalued assets, MUTM is being positioned as the breakout altcoin of the season. Shiba Inu Faces Stiff Competition Despite Meme Coin Momentum Shiba Inu (SHIB) has regained some bullish enthusiasm in recent days, bolstered by whale action and fresh social media mania. But its price is still mired at $0.0000015, with consolidation rather than breakout. SHIB’s loyal fan base continues to push utility extension via Shibarium and ecosystem enhancements, but naysayers argue that its own growth potential is limited unless fresh innovation comes along. As the meme coin market grows more competitive, even die-hard Shiba Inu fans are looking for greener pastures—especially in lesser-known entities such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which some think may provide a more explosive reward. Presale Gaining Momentum: Mutuum Finance Leads the Charge Mutuum Finance presale is far more than halfway through Phase 4, and the momentum is intensifying. Those quick on the uptake can lock in a 20% profit when the next price tier comes into play. With demand comes increased anticipation of even more dramatic profits at launch. With sound tokenomics and practical DeFi applications, MUTM is shaping up fast to be a breakout player in the 2025 altcoin conversation. Unlike the majority of speculation tokens, Mutuum Finance has a Buy-and-Distribute mechanism attached. This model purchases tokens on the market at regular intervals and sends them to MUTM stakers, and hence creating a sustainable, supply-reducing, and encouraging long-term participation. It’s a tactical architecture that enables price appreciation and long-term participation. Mutuum Finance takes security seriously. Its smart contracts are being thoroughly audited by CertiK, one of the most respected blockchain security firms in the industry. Upon completion, results will be publicly disclosed to reassure investors that their funds are secure in an open, professionally audited environment. mtToken System Unlocks Passive Yield With Full Liquidity Another such innovation is mtToken functionality in Mutuum Finance, where assets such as ETH and DAI can be used to earn yield without having to lock them up. Unlike staking, customers remain able to use their assets in full and still earn passive income, a revolution for DeFi users who seek rewards along with usability. Its borrowing side is just as robust with collateralized loans of USDT through easy-to-grasp ratios. A lender could, for example, take out stablecoins of $5,000 for $7,000 worth of ETH collateral, both of which would be returned through open on-chain smart contracts. Shiba Inu (SHIB) may be hyped, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is built different. With over $8.1M raised and 9,800+ holders, MUTM is deep into Phase 4 , already 70% sold out. Act now, $0.025 price won’t last.

As part of President Trump’s economic plan, House Republicans have pushed for trillions of dollars in tax breaks. The House Ways and Means Committee, which is in charge of taxes, talked about the bill all night and passed a part of it on Wednesday morning with a vote of 26 to 19. BREAKING: Ways and Means approves Republicans’ tax bill in a 26-19 vote along party lines Huge step for GOP’s reconciliation push & effort to extend the 2017 tax cuts. Markup went over 17 hrs overnight, Dems forced dozens of amendment votes One big q: SALT still unresolved — Laura Weiss (@LauraEWeiss16) May 14, 2025 Elizabeth Warren translates the bill as “Republicans in Congress want to pass giant tax giveaways for the wealthiest Americans while ripping away health care from 14 million people across this country. Cutting health care for babies to make a handful of billionaires even richer.” X users were fast to correct Warren. One says, “Letting people keep their own money is not a “giveaway.” That’s some Orwellian terminology. Keeping rates where they currently are is also not a “giveaway.” Another adds, “You have the same record as Jim Cramer….. always wrong.” What the tax bill entail, and plans to do This bill would extend Trump’s first term cuts, which are set to end at the end of the year. They will also add new tax breaks for workers, retirees, and private schools. To lower the cost, the package would eliminate green energy projects that were put in place by Democratic President Joe Biden. At the same time, a different House committee was still talking about a Republican plan to tighten eligibility for Medicaid, which covers 71 million low-income Americans. The independent Congressional Budget Office says that would save the government $715 billion and take 7.7 million people off the program. At the start of Tuesday’s debate, police led at least five protesters out of the room. Three of them were in wheelchairs. With its current value of $36.2 trillion, Trump’s Bill would add trillions of dollars to the country’s debt. The plan calls for $4 trillion in additional borrowing, though the total cost is uncertain at this point. Republicans are also under a lot of pressure to work quickly because the country’s debt cap deadline is coming up this summer. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has asked lawmakers to act by mid-July to avoid a default that would destroy the global economy. The fight over the SALT credit for state and local taxes remains As part of President Trump’s tax and spending plan, House Republicans want to raise the cap on the state and local taxes SALT deduction. The House Ways and Means Committee, which is in charge of taxes, made the full copy of its part of the bill public on Monday afternoon. Those with a modified adjusted gross income of $400,000 or less could get up to $30,000 less in SALT. A limit of $10,000 on the federal exemption for SALT was put in place by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017. This limit will end if Congress does not act by 2025. Currently, you can only claim up to $10,000 in state and local taxes, such as income and property taxes, if you itemize your tax breaks. Trump put a $10,000 limit on SALT in 2017, but he changed his mind during the campaign last year, saying he would “get SALT back” if he won again. Since he was sworn in, he has called for change again. However, the battle over the SALT deduction remains in limbo.

Here’s What Happened and Why It’s Bullish For Bitcoin",https://timestabloid.com/100000-btc-in-3-weeks-heres-what-happened-and-why-its-bullish-for-bitcoin/,"In a remarkable development within the cryptocurrency market, Ali, a well-known crypto analyst on X, reported that a staggering 100,000 Bitcoin (BTC) have been moved off exchanges in just three weeks. This significant outflow has sparked discussions across the crypto community regarding its potential impact on Bitcoin’s price trajectory and market sentiment. Why the Massive Bitcoin Outflow Matters The movement of such a substantial volume of Bitcoin from exchanges typically indicates a bullish outlook. When assets are withdrawn from trading platforms, they are less likely to be sold on the open market, suggesting that investors intend to hold rather than trade. This phenomenon often reflects growing confidence in the asset’s long-term value, as holders are willing to secure their investments offline, away from potential exchange vulnerabilities. 100,000 #Bitcoin $BTC have been moved off exchanges in the last 3 weeks! pic.twitter.com/SXEEBXNrSg — Ali (@ali_charts) May 14, 2025 Historically, large BTC outflows from exchanges have been linked to a reduction in selling pressure. With fewer coins available for trading, the circulating supply on exchanges decreases, potentially creating upward price pressure when demand remains stable or rises. The current outflow of 100,000 BTC aligns with this pattern, hinting at a more robust holding sentiment among Bitcoin investors. The Broader Implications for Bitcoin’s Price This sizable exit from exchanges may hint at the anticipation of a bullish market phase. Analysts often interpret such moves as strategic positioning by whales or long-term holders ahead of expected price surges. By moving coins to cold wallets or other secure storage methods, investors mitigate the risk of being swayed by short-term volatility. Furthermore, this trend could signify a renewed belief in Bitcoin’s ability to act as a store of value amid global economic uncertainties. As inflation concerns persist and traditional financial systems show signs of strain, Bitcoin’s appeal as a hedge against economic instability becomes more pronounced. The movement of coins away from exchanges can therefore be seen as a statement of faith in Bitcoin’s enduring value proposition. Potential Catalysts Behind the Move Several factors might be driving this recent shift in Bitcoin holdings. One potential catalyst is the increasing adoption of Bitcoin by institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals. As more corporate entities incorporate BTC into their balance sheets, the inclination to store these assets securely from exchanges becomes more prevalent. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Another possible reason could be the anticipation of regulatory shifts or economic policies that might affect crypto trading. Holding assets off exchanges reduces the exposure to sudden policy changes or exchange-related issues, such as hacks or liquidity crises. Final Thoughts The transfer of 100,000 BTC off exchanges within three weeks is a significant event, and its bullish implications should not be underestimated. As more investors choose to safeguard their holdings offline, the available supply on trading platforms dwindles, creating a potential catalyst for upward price movements. Ali’s insights into this major outflow highlight the continued confidence among long-term Bitcoin holders. As the broader market digests this trend, it remains to be seen whether this strategic withdrawal will precede a sustained bullish rally or signal a fundamental shift in how major players manage their Bitcoin assets.

ADA once seemed unstoppable in its goal to subvert Ethereum’s supremacy, which is known for its academic rigour, peer-reviewed development, and strong DeFi aspirations. But even some of Cardano’s most ardent fans are turning their attention to a rising newcomer: Rexas Finance (RXS) , a $0.20 cryptocurrency making waves across the market. There is a clear change. Once swearing by ADA’s methodical, slow-but-steady approach, crypto investors are now gravitating to a project they think offers far more in terms of utility, vision, and near-term development. While Cardano’s ecosystem has struggled to reach the high standards set years ago, RXS is becoming a more sensible and scalable answer to the future of decentralized finance, actual asset tokenization, and smart token infrastructure. From Patience to Pragmatism Cardano’s price has lagged because it is often seen as a ghost chain. A ghost chain is a popular layer-1 or layer-2 blockchain with no supporting ecosystem. Rexas Finance, on the other hand, has delivered real tools quickly and implemented them faster. The project released the Rexas Launchpad, Token Builder, and QuickMint Bot within its presale lifetime alone, providing developers and consumers instant value and utility. Many investors are pivoting on this difference between “waiting for things to happen” with Cardano and “seeing things already happening” with Rexas. Not yet listed, RXS has progressed from a presale price of $0.03 to its final stage at $0.20, indicating roughly a 6x gain. Over $48.2 million has been raised in the last presale stage. With a launch price set at $0.25 on June 19, 2025, many see it as a ground-floor opportunity that Cardano no longer offers after years in the top 10 rankings. Built for 2025, Not 2017 Cardano was designed when blockchain had to establish itself. The project was forward-looking in 2017, but expectations have changed drastically in 2025. It’s about providing useful, scalable goods that satisfy the needs of actual consumers and institutional stakeholders, not only about possessing theoretical capacity. Rexas Finance is focused on the junction of RWA tokenization, DeFi, and artificial intelligence integration—all three of which will define the next stage of crypto acceptance. Its technologies are meant to streamline the launch of new currencies and digitize assets in an Ethereum-based ecosystem under security. Although Cardano is strong in principle, it still faces challenges in onboarding developers and expanding acceptance in a competitive multichain environment. While RXS is listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, it has already completed a Certik audit and is actively creating an ecosystem instead of only promising one. The Growth Math Favors RXS Cardano, currently trading around $0.60, would need to hit $6 to deliver a 10x return. That’s plausible, but given its large market capitalization, it becomes a far more challenging climb. At a $0.20 price point in its last presale stage, Rexas Finance has significantly more aggressive upside. Some experts estimate a $18 objective if momentum reflects early-stage Ethereum or Solana. Even small estimates show RXS hitting $3–$5 during its first significant bull run. With ADA, such a possible 8900% gain from current levels contrasts with the 10x or 15x maximum that most today aim for. This is not to suggest Cardano is hopeless; it is a strong project with long-term possibilities. But risk-to-reward calculations are constantly shifting in the fast-moving, opportunity-rich crypto world. And for now, those ratios show appeal at Rexas Finance. Final Thoughts Every cycle contains stars. 2021 was Cardano. In 2025, the torch will be passed to Rexas Finance. Though gently, the change from old guard to new vision occurs forcefully. It’s about spotting where the movement is headed, not despising ADA. The possible rewards speak for themselves for investors ready to venture outside the known and investigate a fundamentally solid, fast-evolving cryptocurrency like RXS. The time for early accumulation is rapidly disappearing, with the last presale stage already 92.21% filled. Some who once supported ADA’s promise are now spearheading Rexas Finance . If history is any guide, when the next breakout strikes, these early turning points usually lead to the most significant increases.

In his post, Demanincor pointed to the likely launch of an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF), tying it to the upcoming launch of XRP futures by CME Group on May 19. $XRP ETF LAUNCH MAY 19th DON’T EXPECT OVERNIGHT PRICE ACTION BUT OVER TIME THIS OPENS THE DOOR FOR HUGE LIQUIDITY FLOWS INTO XRP pic.twitter.com/XKyTrnJ5uA — Cypress Demanincor (@CDemanincor) May 13, 2025 He suggested that while the community should not expect any short-term price movements, the development “opens the door for huge liquidity flows into XRP.” The broader message is clear: the groundwork for XRP ETFs is being laid, and institutional access is about to expand. Regulatory Conditions Favor XRP Inclusion During the session, Vicioso explained that CME’s ability to offer futures on any cryptocurrency is directly tied to regulatory classification. He stated that the company must be sure that whatever asset it offers is considered a commodity. According to him, recent developments, including regulatory shifts in the U.S. and the dismissal of certain legal cases, have provided comfort around Solana and XRP. Under Donald Trump’s leadership, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has taken a new stance on crypto regulation, dismissing all pending lawsuits, including the long-running Ripple lawsuit . We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This comfort highlighted by Vicioso is key, as CME cannot launch futures products for assets without a regulatory green light defining a digital asset as a commodity. The fact that CME has now scheduled XRP futures reflects a significant shift in perceived regulatory clarity, specifically for XRP. The court has determined that XRP is not a security , and the end of the lawsuit has removed all regulatory uncertainty surrounding the asset. Market Impact and Institutional Pathways Vicioso indicated that CME already maintains a family of reference rates for 24 different cryptocurrencies and that all their futures products are cash-settled. This structure allows institutions to engage with crypto markets without holding the underlying assets, which aligns with existing ETF frameworks. He also pointed out that when considering Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, and XRP—excluding stablecoins and meme coins—these assets represent around 85% of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. This reinforces XRP’s status as one of the core assets in the market, potentially justifying its inclusion in ETF offerings. CME Group’s XRP futures launch marks a meaningful expansion of institutional access to XRP. It signals that regulatory conditions are shifting in XRP’s favor. While immediate price changes may not be expected, as Demanincor noted, the structural groundwork for increased liquidity and future ETF integration is now being laid.

A Bitcoin price consolidation pattern forecasts a potential 10% breakout by next week. Bitcoin (BTC) continues to show strong bullish momentum as fresh capital inflows signal potential new price highs in the coming week. In an X post , Glassnode reported that Bitcoin’s Realized Cap, which measures the total value of BTC based on the price at which each coin last moved, grew by $30 billion since April 20, growing at a 3% monthly rate in May. The current realized cap is $900 billion. Bitcoin Realize cap. Source: Glassnode Though slower than the 8% spike in late 2024 when BTC hit $93,000, this growth reflects steady investor confidence and new capital entering the market. Adding to the optimism, Glassnode revealed a significant shift in market dynamics. The 7-day simple moving average (SMA) of Bitcoin’s Spot Volume Delta flipped positive, peaking near $5 billion on May 13. Bitcoin spot volume delta. Source: Glassnode This aggressive net spot buyer demand, seen only a few times this year as highlighted, confirms strong spot market conviction behind Bitcoin’s recent push above the $100,000 psychological resistance. The surge in spot buying pressure suggests institutional and retail investors drive the rally, not just leveraged trading. Despite the slower Realized Cap growth compared to late 2024’s $50 billion spike, the current market sentiment remains positive. Related: Strategy will beat all public equities with Bitcoin, analyst says Will Bitcoin gain 10% by next week? Bitcoin has shown a steady consolidation and expansion trend since forming a bottom around $74,500 in early April. Over the past four weeks, a pattern has emerged where each time Bitcoin hits a key level, it moves sideways before breaking out to a higher range. This pattern has repeated twice, with a third consolidation currently underway. Bitcoin 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView Each phase has followed a similar setup, forming higher upper and lower ranges. The bottom range is typically tested at least once before Bitcoin pushes to new highs. The relative strength index (RSI) has complemented this price action, reaching overbought levels during new highs and dropping to around 50 during sideways movement. Currently, Bitcoin is consolidating between an upper range of $105,700 and a lower range of $100,678. If the pattern holds, Bitcoin might retest the $100,000-$102,000 level before potentially breaking above $110,000. However, a bearish invalidation could occur if prices fall below $102,000 and fail to recover swiftly.

Recent United States global trade tensions placed pressure on the dollar, with some traders seeking alternatives. Aside from macro effects, Bitcoin and related assets have gained significant traction since late 2024. Bitcoin Users Capitalize on Dollar Pressure In a recent Bloomberg New Voice event, Amy Lo, UBS Group’s co-head of Asia’s Wealth Management hinted that high-net-worth clients gravitate towards other assets. The U.S. dollar has held sway for many decades, with investors and businesses taking its demand to the roof. In many economies, it served as a hedge against local currency inflation, signaling a sense of stability. However, recent global trade standoffs have ushered in new headwinds for the U.S. Dollar dominance. As a result, institutional wealth managers are recording a progressive shift to other assets particularly digital currencies and precious metals. Chinese assets are also another alternative for certain clients after the previous country-based tariffs imposed on China. Although now suspended for 90 days, financial consumers seek diversity to prevent a major meltdown. According to Lo, these tensions spiked diversity leanings spiking the popularity of gold and crypto . The price of the yellow metal has consistently grown as users aim for a store of value against inflation. Similarly, Bitcoin has found itself in these circles following a bullish drive since its launch. Last year, the top crypto broke multiple resistance levels hitting new all-time highs. Although crypto assets remain volatile, the surge above $108k in January and upward projections are tailwinds for investors. On the flipside, Bitcoin price faced significant dips in the first quarter of the year, still based on macro sentiments making new adopters skeptical of the asset class. Institutional Demand At The Fore For several policy watchers, Bitcoin and crypto assets soared on weaker fiat currencies. In recent months, institutional investors have doubled their exposure to the asset class particularly after the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. These products offer an investment window for traditional clients to hold a piece of the assets. In a nutshell, rising demand and positive global regulation fueled the movement from traditional assets to cryptocurrencies. Decentralized finance (DeFi) activities also climbed in Q4 2024 alongside Bitcoin price.",Bitcoin|Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Gold,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-14 17:34:09

After a brief adjustment, BTC’s recent price has continuously broken through multiple technical resistance levels and strongly returned to above $100,000, and market sentiment has clearly warmed up. Many analysts believe that this round of rise is not only driven by the continuous influx of institutional funds, but is also closely related to macroeconomic factors such as global anti-inflation and the weakening of the US dollar.

This initiative, called “Trillion Dollar Security” (1TS), offers a three-phase plan to increase the resilience of the network. The Ethereum network, which currently holds more than $63 billion in value, must be prepared for broader economic integration, according to the Foundation. The goal is not only to be the most secure platform in the crypto ecosystem, but also to provide a civilization-scale infrastructure that can safely carry the internet and the global economy. The ETH Foundation made the following statement in a blog post published today: “Being the most secure platform in the cryptocurrency ecosystem is not enough. Ethereum’s goal is much bigger: to be the infrastructure that carries the internet and the global economy securely, more secure and reliable than the current financial systems in the world.” Related News: BREAKING: Coinbase Makes Unexpected Announcement About Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE), Litecoin (LTC), and Ripple (XRP) The first step of the new initiative will be to comprehensively analyze the current security posture of Ethereum and identify its strengths and weaknesses, then take precautions against high-risk attack sources and encourage the sharing of security practices across the ecosystem. According to the statement, the initiative will be co-chaired by ETH Foundation Protocol Security Lead Fredrik Svantes and Josh Stark from the management team. Three key figures from the ecosystem will also guide the process: SEAL 911 co-founder Samczsun, Sigma Prime co-founder Mehdi Zerouali, and Etherealize co-founder Zach Obront. The move comes after the ETH Foundation and founder Vitalik Buterin recently announced the foundation’s new governance structure, which aims to enable Ethereum, DeFi’s largest network, to reach more users and scale while preserving its cypherpunk values. *This is not investment advice.

Yu’s case isn’t the first time crypto has blurred the line between real death, faked death and something in between. From missing founders to sealed caskets, the industry has a long history of exits that left behind more questions than closure. Here are five unsettling cases — real, staged or unresolved — that continue to haunt the crypto world. 1. Jeffy Yu faked his death, then his crypto pumped A clip of Yu broadcasting his “suicide ” circulated on May 4. The video showed him smoking a cigarette before pulling the trigger, then the camera dropped. Hours later, a scheduled social media post announced the posthumous launch of LLJEFFY, a memecoin described as his “final art piece.” The coin surged to nearly $105 million in market cap. LLJEFFY’s market fell to $5.63 million from its $105 million peak. Source: DEX Screener But Yu wasn’t dead. Blockchain wallets tied to him kept moving. A copy of a letter — allegedly written by Yu — described the exit design as a response to ongoing harassment and blackmail. Yu’s obituary on online memorial site Legacy.com has now been removed. Source: Vee/Legacy.com Reporters from The San Francisco Standard eventually found Yu at his parents’ home . He refused to comment on the suicide stunt or whether he profited from it. In the world of memecoins, this kind of spectacle isn’t new. In late 2024, Pump.fun’s livestream feature triggered a wave of stunts — suicide threats, animal abuse and other shocking acts — to pump token prices. The company shut it down and later relaunched a toned-down version. 2. A crypto whistleblower’s descent into paranoia and possible death In February 2025, a suspected Chinese programmer who called themselves Hu Lezhi burned 500 Ether ( ETH ) (worth around $1.3 million at the time) and donated another 1,950 ETH (over $5 million) to various groups like WikiLeaks and the Ethereum Foundation. All of it came with onchain messages alleging that a hedge fund called WizardQuant (aka Kuande Investment) was using “brain-computer weapons” to control its employees — including Hu. Related: 4chan rises from the dead: How the imageboard moves crypto markets The messages read like sci-fi horror. Hu claimed he’d been a mind-control test subject since childhood and warned of a future where humans were nothing more than “puppets or complete slaves to the digital machine.” Hu Lezhi’s final messages before disappearing. Source: Etherscan In one of his last messages, Hu said they would “leave the world” if they reached the final stage of becoming a “complete slave to the digital machine.” Some translated the series of messages as an onchain suicide note . To date, they haven’t re-emerged. And unlike Yu, Hu’s wallet hasn’t moved. 3. The crypto whiz and the cryptic tweet before his death On Oct. 28, 2022, DeFi developer Nikolai Mushegian posted a chilling tweet: “CIA and Mossad and pedo elite are running some kind of sex trafficking entrapment blackmail ring… they are going to torture me to death.” By the next morning, he was found face-down in the surf near his beach house in Puerto Rico. A final tweet, a washed-up body, and silence louder than truth. Source: Nikolai Mushegian/fucnti0nZer0 Mushegian wasn’t a random crypto kid. He was an early developer at MakerDAO and a key architect of the stablecoin ecosystem. He was also increasingly paranoid — or, depending on who you ask, increasingly aware. Critics dismissed the tweet as a mental health crisis, but others weren’t so quick to look away. Related: 8 major crypto firms announce US expansion this year The timing of his death sparked a wave of theories: assassination, targeted silencing or even MKUltra-style mind control. Officially, it was ruled an accidental drowning. 4. Crypto investors can’t believe QuadrigaCX founder’s death In December 2018, Gerald Cotten, the 30-year-old founder of Canadian crypto exchange QuadrigaCX, reportedly died in India from Crohn’s disease. But there was one massive problem: He was the only person with access to $190 million in crypto. Cotten’s case was so high-profile that it became the subject of a Netflix documentary. Source: Netflix/YouTube As news of his death spread, so did the questions. There was no public autopsy, his death certificate misspelled his name (spelling Cotten as Cottan), the casket was sealed, and a growing army of investors wanted his body exhumed for DNA testing. Quadriga officially declared bankruptcy in 2019. Thousands of clients were locked out of their funds. Eventually, investigators discovered the cold wallets were empty, prompting auditor EY to begin recovery efforts . Some suspected Cotten had run a Ponzi scheme for years and used his death as the ultimate escape plan. The rumors have not been confirmed, but the official story remains that he died a tragic death, as confirmed by Indian authorities. 5. Reports of Cryptoqueen’s death are greatly exaggerated Self-styled “Cryptoqueen” Ruja Ignatova, co-founder of the $4-billion OneCoin scam, hasn’t been seen since she boarded a Ryanair flight from Sofia to Athens in October 2017. Cotten left no access. Ignatova left no trace. Since then, rumors have swirled. Some say that she underwent plastic surgery and lives under a new identity or that she’s being protected by the Bulgarian mafia. A Bulgarian investigative outlet claims Ignatova was allegedly murdered in November 2018 on a yacht in the Ionian Sea and that her body was dismembered and dumped overboard under the orders of Bulgarian crime boss Christophoros Amanatidis to cover his ties to OneCoin. More recently, German officials reportedly assumed that Ignatova is in a South African suburb living with private security . Ignatova has been on the US FBI’s 10 Most Wanted list since 2022 . The US Federal Bureau of Investigation raised Ignatova’s bounty to $5 million in June 2024.

These altcoins have caught the attention of many, sparking curiosity about potential growth. Delve into the article to discover which coins are poised for further advancement and capture this market momentum. Ethena (ENA): Recent Surge and Key Trading Zones Past month ENA performance reveals a strong rally of 60.53% weekly and a monthly gain of 40.93%. However, the six-month period shows a decline of 19.42%. Price movements have fluctuated between $0.25 and $0.39, highlighting a volatile environment. Historical trends indicate that while short-term bursts have increased value, longer periods reflect caution among market participants. Current price action is situated between key support at $0.18 and resistance at $0.45, with secondary resistance noted at $0.59. Bulls appear to dominate in the short term, with upward momentum and RSI readings. However, bears remain evident when looking at the longer perspective. Traders should consider opportunities near the support region and monitor for potential breakouts above the resistance levels. Optimism's Rollercoaster: Weekly Gains Amid Long-Term Setbacks Optimism recorded a 42.47% increase over one week and a 28.98% rise in one month, while a 42.57% decline marked the past six months. OP experienced rapid surges and sharp pullbacks, reflecting its volatile nature through alternating phases of momentum and retracement. This behavior underscores the challenges traders face as they navigate OP's unpredictable price movements. Current trading ranges between $0.57 and $0.87, with a support level at $0.41 and resistance at $1.02, followed by a secondary resistance at $1.32. Indicators such as an RSI of 59.73 and a slight bullish momentum suggest that bulls have a slight edge. The price is currently testing key levels, creating opportunities for cautious trades around breakout attempts or retests of support. Raydium RAY Market Insight: Surge, Dip, and Key Zones Over the last month, Raydium rallied by 78% with a notable one-week jump of 42%, while a six-month decline of 26% highlights its volatile path. Price action has been dynamic with strong short-term gains contrasted by a longer-term pullback that reflects shifting market sentiment and cautious investor behavior. Current trading levels range from $1.73 up to $3.50, facing immediate resistance at $4.21 and stronger resistance at $5.97, with support around $0.68. The RSI near 70 points to possible overextension, suggesting bulls remain active yet the market lacks a clear upward trend. This situation encourages careful plays within these key price boundaries. Conclusion ENA , OP , and RAY have shown impressive performances today. The momentum behind these altcoins is strong. The market response has been positive, with increased trading volumes. The question remains whether this rally can sustain itself. Future movements will depend on broader market trends. Investor interest and market dynamics will also play crucial roles. Staying informed and monitoring these altcoins will be key. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Bitcoin (BTC) leads the pack as bulls strengthen positions ahead of another upward swing. Meanwhile, altcoins have also attracted demand, driving up the total market capitalization. Crypto Whales Ramp Up Holdings On-chain data shows a surge in investment in the last three weeks following the White House’s pause on country-based tariffs. Crypto enthusiast Ali Martinez wrote on X that total market inflows surpassed $35 billion, signaling a fresh wave of growth. This comes after flat movements from most crypto assets, underscored by the price dip. In the same period, crypto funds flipped outflows recording billions in new flows. Last week, traders saw $882 million inflows taking total yearly numbers above $6.7 billion. A significant milestone was spot Bitcoin ETFs accumulating over $62.9 billion since approval in the United States. These funds reshaped institutional dominance in crypto assets. “ Bitcoin dominated inflows, attracting US$867m globally last week. It also reached a new milestone, as US-listed ETFs recorded cumulative net inflows of US$62.9bn since their launch in January 2024, surpassing the previous high of US$61.6bn set in early February,” CoinShares wrote. Crypto whales have also become mega bullish on Bitcoin with recent purchases and centralized exchange outflows. Over the past month, Binance whale address balances dropped from $5 billion to $3 billion. In contrast, retail volumes spiked, with traders doubling down on profit taking. Digital asset analyst Darkfrost explained that this shift in sentiments shows bulls’ projections of the market direction. BTC Traders Project Price Jump Bulls have set their sights on a new price run after Bitcoin regained the $100k mark, which had a lingering effect on altcoin prices. This is hinged on a positive outlook from global institutional and market players. On May 14, Standard Chartered announced a partnership with crypto prime broker FalconX to integrate its banking infrastructure. Major partnerships fuel institutional demand , attracting more capital. In return, crypto prices record major growth, particularly Bitcoin and top altcoins. The market direction can be gauged by using BTC miners’ reserves. On-chain data shows miners have halted asset sales since the recent price surge. Per Glassnode data, miners’ wallets held 1,794,330 on May 13. Most market analysts saw this as an extremely bullish sign for the asset.",Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Cryptocurrency News|Ethereum News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-14 17:38:42

Users to Receive Regular Payouts Staking involves committing your crypto assets to support the security and operations of a blockchain network. In the case of Cosmos, it’s a proof-of-stake network, meaning that users can earn rewards by helping to verify transactions. In return for locking up their assets, users will receive regular payouts, which are deposited automatically into their staking wallets. Luno’s staking model is also designed with accessibility in mind. There are no minimum investment amounts to begin staking, no hidden fees, and no fixed terms. Customers maintain full control over their crypto at all times, with the ability to stake and unstake whenever they choose. Rewards will be credited within one to seven days, with the potential for compounding growth as returns are added to balances daily. According to the firm, over 150,000 Luno customers have already created staking wallets, and more than R1.5 billion has been staked through the platform. Ethereum remains the most staked crypto asset on Luno, followed by Solana. Now, with ATOM offering the highest yield, it could soon become a top contender among South African crypto enthusiasts. However, de Wit cautions users to be aware of the inherent volatility in crypto markets. “Staking rewards are added to your existing balance daily, so your earnings may compound faster if you keep them there. But remember that crypto can go up and down in value,” he said. “This means it can drive exponential growth if the value of your investment goes up, but you could lose out if the monetary value of your asset goes down.” Luno said it continues to expand its crypto offerings while maintaining transparency about both the potential benefits and risks. As staking becomes an increasingly popular way to earn passive income on digital assets, the addition of Cosmos further positions Luno as a leader in the South African crypto market. Luno Launches Solana Staking in Malaysia Earlier this month, Luno announced it had launched its third crypto staking for Solana. Scarlett Chai, Luno’s country manager, noted that the exchange has already released the teaser for the launch. The Solana staking would let its users earn SOL rewards every two days and passively grow their crypto investment portfolio. This marks the exchange’s third crypto staking after Ethereum and Cardano.

The meme video humorously envisions a future where XRP’s value skyrockets past $200,000, making one lucky holder the richest person in the world. As the narrative unfolds, the internet can’t help but laugh while imagining the ripple effect of such a dramatic price surge. The Meme That Sparked It All The video’s premise is straightforward yet comically exaggerated: XRP’s price explodes to unprecedented levels, propelling Anon, a fictional XRP holder, to unimaginable wealth. In this hypothetical scenario, Bitcoin maxis, long skeptical of XRP’s potential, find themselves in a state of utter despair. Meanwhile, XRP enthusiasts rejoice, celebrating at a symbolic Bitcoin grave site—a humorous representation of Bitcoin’s fall from dominance. Every $XRP holder will have this video playing on replay soon. pic.twitter.com/Plf983Mntg — 𓂀 (@PharaohX33) May 13, 2025 This lighthearted portrayal strikes a chord with XRP supporters who have weathered years of price fluctuations, legal challenges, and skepticism from Bitcoin maximalists. The meme encapsulates the long-held optimism among XRP holders who believe in the token’s potential to outperform market expectations . Why the Meme Resonates Memes in the crypto space often reflect the collective hopes, frustrations, and dreams of the community. In this case, PharaohX33’s creation resonates because it cleverly juxtaposes XRP’s perceived underdog status against Bitcoin’s long-standing market dominance. By portraying XRP holders as ultimately victorious, the video serves as a cathartic fantasy for those who have maintained faith in the token despite ongoing regulatory scrutiny and volatile market conditions. Beyond the humor, the meme also subtly comments on the rivalry between Bitcoin maximalists and the XRP community . For years, debates about which asset holds more intrinsic value have fueled passionate discussions across social media. This video humorously envisions an outcome where XRP not only wins but does so in spectacular fashion, with its holders reaping unimaginable financial rewards. The Realistic Outlook While the video’s premise is exaggerated for comedic effect, it highlights the unwavering conviction some XRP holders have regarding the asset’s potential. Realistically, XRP reaching such astronomical figures remains highly speculative, yet the meme thrives on the inherent optimism that characterizes the crypto community. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Investors and enthusiasts alike should approach such content with a sense of humor while remembering that memes, however entertaining, do not equate to financial predictions. Still, the video underscores the fact that community-driven content can significantly influence sentiment, whether through lighthearted jest or more serious advocacy. Final Thoughts PharaohX33’s meme may be pure fantasy, but it speaks to the enduring hope within the XRP community. As the digital asset market continues to evolve, such creative expressions remind us of the diverse perspectives that make the crypto space uniquely vibrant. Whether XRP ever reaches the heights imagined in the video or not, the shared amusement and camaraderie among its supporters are worth celebrating. At the end of the day, memes like this one serve not only to entertain but also to reinforce the communal spirit of the XRP faithful. For now, it’s all in good fun, but who knows—maybe one day, this meme will seem less like fantasy and more like foresight.

Price is now correcting into a confluence of technical levels, setting the stage for a potential explosive move higher. After weeks of upward momentum, Floki ( FLOKI ) is beginning to retrace — but the correction looks more bullish than bearish. The meme coin has broken out of long-term suppression under the 200-day moving average, and the recent pullback appears to be a setup for continuation rather than weakness. The next major support zone lines up with several key technical indicators, giving traders a strong level to watch for a higher low to form. Key technical points 200-Day MA Flipped Into Support: FLOKI has broken and closed above its 200-day moving average, confirming a shift in long-term market structure. Support Confluence Zone Below: The current correction is targeting a region where the upsloping channel support, 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, swing low, and value area low all align. Potential for Aggressive Bounce: If support holds, price could revisit the channel high in an impulsive move, as seen during previous rallies. FLOKIUSDT (1H) Chart, Source: TradingView FLOKI’s breakout above the 200-day moving average was a major development for bulls, confirming that the long-standing downtrend has been broken. Price action was impulsive during the breakout and accompanied by strong volume, suggesting genuine market interest. The coin has now begun to retrace, but this appears to be a standard corrective structure, a higher low forming before continuation. The area just below the current price carries significant technical weight. The upsloping channel support lines up closely with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement of the recent rally, the value area low from the current range, and a key swing low. This creates a high-confluence support zone, which often acts as a magnet for price and a potential launchpad for the next bullish leg. You might also like: WIF price at risk as Dogwifhat exchange inflows rise, smart money sells Being a meme coin, FLOKI is known for fast, aggressive movements once trends gain traction. Previous corrections during this trend have been sharp but short-lived, with quick recoveries that push price back toward the channel high. The same pattern could repeat here if buyers step in at the confluence level. What to expect in the coming price action If FLOKI holds the current support zone, a rally toward the channel high is likely, especially if volume begins to increase again. However, if this level fails, price may revisit internal weekly support further below. For now, the trend remains bullish, and traders should watch for confirmation of a higher low before entering.

It wants to use crypto mining to improve its power grid system and expand crypto trading beyond its current limits. At the same time, it wants to allow more people to trade digital assets across the country. Kazakhstan Proposes New Model for Energy and Crypto Mining Kazakhstan wants to upgrade its old thermal power plants. To do this, the government has proposed a “70/30” model. Under this plan, foreign investors will help pay for the upgrades. In return, 30% of the new energy will be used for crypto mining, while 70% will go into the national power grid. These efforts were outlined by Kanysh Tuleushin, Kazakhstan’s first Vice Minister of Digital Development, Innovation and Aerospace Industry. He said this is similar to what happens in the United States, where crypto miners use extra electricity when demand is low. This will help keep the power system stable. Kazakhstan also wants to use waste gas called associated petroleum gas (APG) to improve crypto mining. This gas comes from oil production and is often burned and wasted. The government plans to use it to power crypto mining farms, which will help reduce pollution and increase oil companies’ revenue. Kazakhstan’s Crypto Mining Sector Is Growing Kazakhstan’s mining sector is growing fast. Since 2023, the government has registered over 415,000 mining machines, given out 84 licenses, and approved five mining pools. The mining industry has already recorded $34.6 million in taxes over the last three years, and this came after it introduced laws to fight crypto mining tax fraud . Furthermore, Kazakhstan is making progress with testing its digital currency, the digital tenge. So far, 250 billion have been issued, and the currency has tracking features to help stop corruption and ensure public money is used properly. Kazakhstan To Expand Crypto Trading Outside AIFC While countries like Nebraska is cracking down of crypto ATM due to increasing fraud, the Kazakhstan government is making new rules to make them accessible across the country. Kazakhstan is also developing new rules to legalize crypto trading. However, this requires approval from the National Bank and the Financial Market Regulation Agency. Currently, legal crypto trading only occurs in the Astana International Financial Centre (AIFC) zone. In 2023, crypto trading at AIFC exchanges reached $324.2 million, but by 2024, trading volume jumped to $1.4 billion. The government wants to change this by allowing trading across the country. Tuleushin said that if the government imposed a 10% tax on the unregulated trading market, it could bring in $372.9 million yearly. He said this revenue could help build schools, hospitals, and other public projects.

The cryptocurrency firm is asked to pay $50 million, a massive drop from the initial $125 million fine. Once accepted, the settlement, which is currently awaiting approval from the District Court Judge Analisa Torres, will bring Ripple an inch closer to dissolving its four-year-long legal battle with the SEC. As market participants prepare for the weeks ahead, community members remain curious about what the settlement agreement truly means and what it could mean for Ripple and the XRP token in the long term. XRP poised to enter a new phase In a post shared with X, a pseudonymous XRP enthusiast breaks down the expected shift that could follow the settlement’s acceptance and the case’s dissolution. Approval of the settlement could trigger a major change in the XRP token’s market position. Regulatory clarity is a key upside that could be attained in the long run, as the SEC’s decision further solidifies Ripple’s long-standing claim that the crypto asset is not a security. With XRP perceived as a crypto asset comes an increase in credibility among existing holders and investors looking to make a big entrance. Legal risks are also expected to flatten for Ripple and other crypto businesses, such as exchanges, crypto service providers, and crypto investors. Dissolution promises mass adoption for Ripple Mass adoption could be a notable by-product for the broader Ripple ecosystem, especially with the rise in demand for Spot XRP ETFs . Per Polymarket’s predictions, there is a 70% chance of approval by 2026. With leading investment firms like 21Shares and Bitwise filing for approval, a Spot ETF could unlock significant institutional capital. It is worth noting that Ripple’s adoption has been continuous over the years, with more than 300 financial institutions utilizing its technology.

This was reported by Bloomberg . To be on the top 220 holders list, you needed to have about $54,500 in tokens over the past three weeks, but Christensen and his friends found a way to splurge just on trading commissions. They would buy the right amount of TRUMP and open a short for the same amount. After the final guest list was announced, users sold tokens and closed short positions. ”We figured it wouldn't cost much to participate in the competition, we gave it a shot and did it,” Christensen noted. The trader himself first bought tokens in January, an hour after the announcement. In his own words, the same weekend he sold assets 30 times more expensive. ”Then he announced the dinner, at first I ignored it, I thought the competition would be too tough. Then eight days before the end I saw the leaderboard. It wasn't that expensive, maybe $60,000 or $70,000,” the trader added. Friends wrote a special program that tracked the portfolios of potential guests and predicted the amount of tokens needed to get on the list. According to Christensen, when the big players entered the contest, the five traders decided to buy TRUMP to secure their positions; At the time the winners were announced, the user held about $250,000 in the ”presidential meme coin.” He ranked #188 under the nickname Aird. The trader has already received the notification, provided the necessary data for checks and booked the plane tickets. Trump's crypto projects to be vetted for conflicts of interest Democrats left a joint hearing on digital assets in the US Congress, accusing Republicans of ignoring Donald Trump's conflict of interest. The reason was the president's ties to the crypto industry, including issuing the meme coin Trump and lobbying for projects through his family. Democrats vs. Republicans House Financial Services Committee Vice Chair Maxine Waters said Republicans are ”legitimizing corruption” by refusing to discuss Trump's impact on regulation. In response, Republicans used a loophole in the rules to convert the hearing into a roundtable discussion. Brian Steil, chairman of the Digital Assets Subcommittee, said the discussion would continue without Democrats. Republican French Hill urged his colleagues to focus on creating a regulatory framework for the crypto market, but did not respond to claims about Trump's ties to the industry. He said Democrats had ”politicized” the process. Earlier, Democrats declared that they would not support the GENIUS Act steblecoin bill unless tough anti-money laundering rules and restrictions on foreign issuers were added. ”Trump has launched his own stablecoin - this is unacceptable. We've been working on regulation for three years, and now we're being rushed through, ignoring key risks,” Waters emphasized. At issue is the USD1 stablecoin launched by the DeFi project of the Trump family World Liberty Financial (WLFI). MEME Act In parallel, Democratic Senator Chris Murphy has proposed legislation to prohibit US federal officials, including Trump, from promoting meme-coins for personal gain. The document, called the MEME Act , is intended to curb the use of official position to enrich oneself through digital assets or securities. The occasion was TRUMP, launched before Trump's inauguration on the Solana blockchain. Murphy called the token ”an example of corruption.” ”Trump has turned the crypto market into a personal Venmo account where foreign oligarchs transfer millions for political favors.” Congressman Sam Liccardo (Democrat from California) supported the MEME Act: ”Republicans are silent while Trump turns the White House into a tool for personal enrichment.” Financial policy expert Amanda Fisher said that cryptocurrencies are often used for fraud. Officials should not be allowed to profit from them, she emphasized. Trump's cryptocurrencies check Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal sent requests to World Liberty Financial (WLFI) and Fight Fight Fight LLC to disclose details of Trump's involvement in the projects. Politico reported that the Senate investigations committee is launching a probe into possible conflicts of interest and legislative violations. In a letter to Fight Fight Fight LLC, which launched TRUMP, Blumenthal pointed to the token's price spikes and suggested that a narrow range of individuals capitalized on its launch. He also criticized Dinner with Trump: in his opinion, the promotion was launched to stimulate token sales after a drop in interest. ”Trump's ties to the TRUMP token and attempts to use the White House to increase its value is an unprecedented scheme to access power for money,” the senator said. Blumenthal said in a statement to WLFI that the Trump family has received ”significant financial benefits” from the project and that cooperating with foreign investors poses a national security risk. Companies must provide documents on the ownership structure, financial flows and measures to prevent conflicts of interest until July 27.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|MEME|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-14 17:53:37

Saylor observed a notable change in the Bitcoin market, particularly among key holders. The Bitcoin proponent maintains that a fundamental shift in investor behavior has occurred. According to Saylor, the new development ties back to a primary difference in the type of holders entering and exiting the Bitcoin market. Older investors appear to be exiting the market, thus paving the way for new players. He asserted that short-term holders are making their way out. In contrast, long-term institutional players are being ushered into the Bitcoin market. In a recent interview with Coin Stories, a crypto-centered podcast, Saylor is quoted as saying the following ; “ I think we’re going through a rotation right now…. So I think people less committed to the long term have taken the opportunity to exit the market, and a whole new class of investors are entering by way of ETFs and Bitcoin treasury companies.” Bankruptcy trustees, lawyers, and governments seem to have snagged a handful of Bitcoin tokens for themselves, he observed, further adding that these demographics of holders are not long-term players. Saylor added that, as a result, the recent surge in the asset’s price value presented a liquidation opportunity and a perfect exit for these participants. Michael Saylor also expressed surprise at the positive shift in the government’s attitude towards Bitcoin, as he noticed a rise in enthusiasm among Cabinet members. Bitcoin crossed the $100,000 mark on May 8th, 2025, for the first time since February. While the market remains optimistic, Bitcoin must surpass many technical and fundamental barriers to sustain its current momentum.

If you are searching for the best crypto projects with clear uses, fair reward systems, and low presale prices, this list will help you. Leave behind the slow gains and empty promises. These projects are raising large sums quickly, creating tools to improve Web3, and giving early participants a chance at major growth. One project even plans to reward AI performance with on-chain proof, not likes or clicks. Here is the project leading the way right now. 1. Unstaked (UNSD): Building AI Agents That Will Earn by Doing Unstaked is not just another idea in crypto. It plans to change how rewards work. Instead of offering promises of AI tools that may come later, Unstaked is designing a system where AI agents will earn by performing tasks. There will be no free giveaways or rewards for holding only. Rewards will be based on real work, recorded on-chain for everyone to see. Unstaked is now in stage 12 of its presale at $0.008997 and has raised over $5.8 million so far. Two million dollars came in just two days. After the presale, the token is expected to launch at $0.1819. If the $3 price forecast comes true, early participants could see up to a 27 times return. While AI agents are not yet live and will be available after launch, the plan is already getting strong attention. Unstaked offers a clear idea: users will deploy AI agents on platforms like Telegram or X. Rewards will depend only on proof of action recorded on-chain. With talk of a possible $3 value and a focus on rewarding effort, Unstaked stands out. It belongs at the top of any list of the best crypto projects to watch right now. 2. Livepeer (LPT): Decentralized Video Network with AI Support Livepeer is a blockchain video streaming network that uses AI to improve video encoding and delivery. It avoids costly central services by using a network of nodes. Those who provide bandwidth and computing power earn LPT tokens. AI helps Livepeer lower streaming costs, expand its capacity, and improve video quality through automation. This makes it a strong option among the best crypto projects, especially as video streaming grows worldwide. Livepeer does not just follow trends. It addresses real challenges faced by content creators. As more streaming platforms look for lower-cost and decentralized options, Livepeer’s role is likely to expand. 3. Audius (AUDIO): AI-Powered Music Streaming for Creators Audius is a decentralized music streaming service where artists keep control of their work and earn money directly. With AI tools being added, such as music recommendations and content suggestions, Audius continues to improve its platform. The AUDIO token supports voting, staking, and rewards within the network. It allows users to join a music system that values the creators. AI also helps offer personalized user experiences and improves how the platform runs. For those looking for the best crypto project combining music, blockchain, and AI tools, Audius provides an interesting mix that few other platforms offer. 4. Theta Network (THETA): Using AI for Better Video Streams Theta’s aim is to provide high-quality video without the delays found in traditional systems. Its use of AI to improve delivery paths, detect poor video streams, and better use bandwidth makes it a strong contender among the best crypto projects. Users share their internet bandwidth and earn rewards in THETA tokens. While users do not see the AI directly, it works to make streaming faster and cheaper, which benefits platforms and users alike. Backers such as Samsung and Sony give Theta added trust. As AI continues to improve its network behind the scenes, Theta’s place in video delivery may keep growing. Closing Thoughts on the Best Crypto Projects The best crypto projects are no longer just ideas for the future. They are raising funds, building real tools, and changing the way rewards and platforms work. Unstaked leads with its AI reward system and has already raised $5.8 million. Livepeer, Audius, and Theta are also adding AI to improve video and music platforms people use every day. The chance to join early is closing. Unstaked will not remain under one cent for long, especially with a launch price planned at 27 times the current value. For those exploring strong choices in crypto and AI, this may be the right time to act.

Capital rotation into high-beta tokens like ETH, PEPE, and SUI signals rising risk appetite. With Bitcoin’s [BTC] dominance chart flashing signs of exhaustion, the spotlight is shifting fast. Analysts believe we’re on the cusp of a full-blown “altseason” – this is when investors move away from BTC and double down on emerging, high-velocity tokens. As the market awakes with fresh momentum, the next wave of explosive altcoin gains may already be underway. Altcoins gain ground as momentum builds Over half of tracked altcoins – 31 out of 57 – have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 60 days, showing a clear shift in market momentum. Memecoin Pepe [PEPE] leads the pack with a staggering 117% return, followed by strong performances from EOS [EOS] , THORChain [RUNE] , and Sui [SUI] . Source: Alphractal Even Ethereum [ETH], often seen as a proxy for altcoin health, is up 40%, outpacing Bitcoin’s 24%. This trend shows growing investor appetite for higher-beta assets, especially as BTC dominance begins to falter. The market appears to be rotating aggressively into alts with fresh narratives, volume surges, and breakout potential. Tracy Jin, COO of MEXC, told AMBCrypto, “The usual early signals are flashing: declining USDT dominance, improving price structure on altcoin charts, and rising interest in sector leaders like Monero, Sui, and Bittensor…” She added, “It’s still technically ‘Bitcoin season,’ but the groundwork for altcoin rotation is clearly forming.” Signals flash as BTC dominance breaks lower Bitcoin’s price has stalled near recent highs, while the percentage of outperforming alts is rising rapidly. Historically, such divergences precede explosive upside in the altcoin market. “Bitcoin dominance just took a noticeable dip – from 65% down to 62% – while the altcoin market cap jumped $300 billion in a matter of weeks. That kind of shift doesn’t happen without reason.” Source: Alphractal After a prolonged “bitcoin season” marked by dominance and capital concentration, traders are now rotating out of BTC in search of higher beta plays – potentially igniting the next wave of aggressive altcoin rallies. Correction isn’t collapse! With BTC nearing local highs and showing signs of exhaustion, short-term pullbacks are expected. Historically, these phases have led to capital shifting into altcoins, particularly those with strong narratives and momentum. Tracy Jin further explained, “If capital continues flowing this way, the first wave of altcoin season could arrive sooner than expected. Traders are seeking outsized returns, especially now that BTC appears overextended.” As risk appetite grows and BTC consolidates, sidelined liquidity often moves into smaller-cap tokens with high growth potential. For seasoned investors, this moment is less about caution and more about strategic positioning—an opportunity to capitalize as altcoins gain traction.",Altcoin|News|News 1|Social|Trading View|ambcrypto,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET,"{'name': 'AMB Crypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/ambcrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",ambcrypto,2025-05-14 18:00:58

According to a new report from The Wall Street Journal, GD Culture Group – a New York-based artificial-intelligence (AI) software firm with a market value of about $26 million – has raised $300 million to purchase digital assets such as Bitcoin ( BTC ) and TRUMP. The report says that the firm’s main investor is based in the British Virgin Islands, but no specific entity or person was named. The deal appears to be structured as an equity line of credit, meaning the investor will purchase $300 million worth of the firm’s stock over time at a discounted price and then sell the shares on the open market. News of the fundraise boosted GD Culture Group’s (GDC) stock price, pushing it from a low of $2.14 on May 13th to a peak of $2.31 on the 14th. GDC has since retraced and is trading for $2.18 at time of writing, a 1.94% increase during the last 24 hours. GDC, which the report says uses AI-based algorithms to create digital human avatars to sell products on the social media app TikTok, joins other firms, such as Strategy, in creating a crypto asset treasury. BTC is trading for $103,402 at time of writing, a fractional decrease on the day, while TRUMP is valued at $13.16, a 2.4% increase during the last 24 hours.

This approach is expected to have a profound impact on the electoral process, despite the fact that Bitcoin ETFs and institutional investors are not currently allowed in the country. Currently, 100% of cryptocurrency trading is done by individual investors. Democratic Party candidate Lee Jae-myung and People's Power Party candidate Kim Moon-soo are drawing attention with bold cryptocurrency promises unseen in previous elections to win over young and middle-class voters. Both major candidates today promised to allow spot ETFs for major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to be traded on domestic exchanges, a move that is expected to boost the investment climate. South Korea will hold early presidential elections on June 3, 2025. Lee Jae-myung announced in a Facebook post on May 6 that they will work towards introducing spot ETFs and establishing an integrated surveillance system, saying, “We will help young people build wealth.” He also stated that crypto transaction fees will be reduced. Kim Moon-soo introduced the “Middle Class Wealth Increasing Project” as one of his election promises and stated that he planned to introduce spot ETFs within this scope. He also said in the party primaries that he would allow state institutions to invest in cryptocurrencies and give the green light to spot ETFs. But financial regulators remain cautious, citing potential risks to the financial system from virtual assets. Spot ETFs would require financial institutions to hold virtual assets, which could create volatility in financial markets. Related News: Billionaire CEO Anthony Scaramucci Says: “Bitcoin Will Become a Real Asset Class When It Reaches This Price” Within the scope of the “Virtual Currency Emergency Measures” that came into effect in 2017, corporate financial institutions were prohibited from holding, purchasing, providing collateral or forming partnerships with virtual currencies. Despite this, in March 2025, the ruling and opposition parties agreed to re-evaluate spot ETFs in order to revitalize the market. The fact that both parties' presidential candidates support spot ETFs has increased expectations that the legal process in this area may accelerate. Beyond spot ETFs, presidential candidates are laying out sweeping plans to revitalize the virtual asset sector. The Democratic Party recently held its first meeting by establishing a Digital Asset Committee under its election campaign committee. The committee began discussing legal frameworks covering topics such as stablecoins, NFTs, and security token offerings (STOs). Committee Chairman MP Min Byeong-deok said, “It is time to enact the Basic Digital Asset Law that balances user protection and industry development.” The People’s Power Party announced a package of crypto promises at the emergency committee level on April 28. These include: Allowing spot ETFs, The abolition of the “one stock exchange, one bank” principle, Institutionalization of virtual asset trading among companies and institutions, Establishing a stablecoin regulation system, Enactment of the Basic Law for the Development of Digital Assets, It includes the introduction of a revolutionary new tax system. *This is not investment advice.

Last month, $ARKM was trading at $0.4685. As of press time, it stands at $0.7567, after reaching a daily high of $0.8382. Traders anticipate the token could revisit its 2024 high of $3.99 as market sentiment remains bullish. Arkham’s Growth Trajectory: Still Undervalued vs. Competitors? Despite the rally, Arkham’s market cap of $190 million trails behind key rivals in AI and blockchain analytics. For instance, AI agent AIXBT , which operates via X (formerly Twitter) to provide sentiment analysis, is valued at over $190 million. $ARKM ranks 277th crypto in the market behind AIXBT, Vana, Kaito, etc: Source:/ CoinMarketCap Another data infrastructure project, Kaito, focused on social data analytics, holds a valuation exceeding $400 million. Yet Arkham’s unique positioning, including real-time transaction tracking, wallet identification, and its new U.S.-based Arkham Exchange (combining analytics with trading), could fuel a rebound. Recently, it expanded its services to include spot and futures trading on its newly launched Arkham Exchange in the U.S., integrating its analytics platform with direct trading access. According to CoinMarketCap community sentiment, over 89% of 33,000 voters anticipate further price growth, with many eyeing the $0.85 level as a short-term target. Arkham community sentiment/ Source: CoinMarketCap A new feature could be fueling this optimism. Arkham now lets users track wallets tied to major X accounts with over 100,000 followers. This includes high-profile figures like Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin, Tron’s Justin Sun, and even U.S. President Donald Trump, giving traders insights into the moves of influential market players. How Arkham Helped Crack the $1.5B Bybit Hack Arkham’s reputation for blockchain transparency has been bolstered by its role in key investigations. During the infamous $1.5 billion Bybit hack, Arkham partnered with blockchain sleuth ZachXBT to trace the stolen funds, awarding him a 50,000 $ARKM token bounty for successfully identifying the hacker using Arkham’s analytics. My submission has been sent identifying the organization behind the attack using on-chain data. — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) February 21, 2025 Listed on Binance since 2023, $ARKM is described as an “intel-to-earn” token , a tool that fuels blockchain transparency through AI.

The price has now surged past $0.70, reaching $0.737 at the time of the snapshot. $ARKM Price Prediction/ Source: TradingView The volume on the breakout exceeded 16.3M, indicating strong buying interest and potential accumulation. The RSI Divergence Indicator (14, close) shows a clear bullish divergence from February through April, with several “Bull” indicators confirmed.

The first lies at $1.043, marking the initial area of resistance where some traders may look to take profits or where the price might consolidate. $ARKM 1 Token related to onchain and AI, 1 token you can buy in large quantities, without worrying about price drops, the current price is very nice, in a few weeks you will soon see it priced at 1.5-2$ 1 token loved by sharks Entry: 0.65-0.75$ TP: 5-7$ X8-9 entry #ARKM #AI pic.twitter.com/Aa6vaVbjp1 — Harley .

This area should be watched closely for confirmation of support if a retest occurs.
