Bitcoin fell 8.1% over the last 24 hours, with traders reacting to political uncertainty. Analysts pointed out that macroeconomic shocks remain a central factor in controlling the behavior of the market in the short term and determining the overall BTC price narrative going into the end of the year. Dogecoin‚Äôs price has also slipped as traders decreased their holdings of risk assets following the global selloff. Analysts noted that the most recent market pullout shows growing caution and renewed volatility in all digital assets. Despite the turmoil in the market, some altcoins are displaying surprising resilience. Amongst them is MAGACOIN FINANCE , a community-driven project that is gaining rapid traction in view of its upcoming exchange listings. Investors and analysts are already referring to it as a hidden 50X altcoin, pointing to a strong whale support and early adoption helping it defy the general downturn. Bitcoin Price Action ‚Äî Sellers Target the $100K Retest Bitcoin price now trades close to $111,871, down from the $125K resistance that was tested earlier this month. Technical charts indicate that BTC broke out of an ascending channel that supported the uptrend across 2025. The Parabolic SAR has flipped above price candles, indicating that short-term control has been transferred to sellers. Meanwhile, the RSI near 43 indicates a lack of conviction from buyers and more room for downside. Source: X Bitcoin is now trading within a broad consolidation zone between $100K ‚Äì $125K. A firm close below the trendline on a daily basis could pave the way for a complete retest of the $100K support, which is a significant psychological level for traders. If macroeconomic tensions persist and sentiment stays fragile, analysts note that the correction could come back as early as 2026. Still, some believe that once the $100K base holds, then Bitcoin may be poised for a recovery that brings the overall crypto market correction cycle back into another bull run. Dogecoin Holds Decade-Long Channel Support Dogecoin has continued to defy expectations. Despite doubt over its long-term fundamentals, the ten-year ascending channel for the coin still holds up. The most recent bounce from the lower boundary indicates that both algorithmic systems and institutional traders are closely monitoring these levels. Analyst Olivier √ê Maùïèimus pointed out DOGE‚Äôs rebound exactly at the point of the lower band of the channel, and redo the proof that the algorithm is reinforcing the same technical structure. Source: X The weekly chart highlights Dogecoin trading at $0.19 and $0.20 in a consistent manner with the previous cycle bottoms. Resistance is now near $0.34-$0.35 with potential upside targets towards $0.90, should the bullish pattern persist. Long-term extensions of the Fibonacci series set $5-$7 for possible highs, at extreme $10+ with force on reversed cycles. Such precision in trendlines suggests the existence of an ongoing institutional awareness and algorithmic involvement in Dogecoin‚Äôs market. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Traction as Hidden 50x Altcoin While Bitcoin and Dogecoin capture headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly building strong momentum beneath the surface. The project has attracted growing attention ahead of several upcoming exchange listings, which analysts believe could mark a turning point for its exposure. These listings have amplified interest among investors seeking early-stage exposure to a structured and transparent ecosystem. MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äôs roadmap emphasizes long-term utility, and its community-driven model and fixed supply framework have positioned it as one of the most promising entrants in this market cycle. Analysts project that once liquidity from exchange listings increases, the token could deliver 50x upside as broader retail and institutional participation expands. The Calm Before the Next Breakout The market reset has created both caution and opportunity. Bitcoin‚Äôs price may still retest $100K before stabilizing, while Dogecoin‚Äôs price continues to respect long-term trendlines that have guided it for nearly a decade. Both moves highlight how algorithmic systems and institutional traders still influence technical dynamics across major cryptocurrencies. At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the quiet frontrunner of this correction phase. Its upcoming exchange listings, transparent roadmap, and expanding community are driving accumulation even as larger assets decline. With analysts projecting up to 50x returns, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents the rare combination of early-stage opportunity and whale-driven confidence, a formula that could define the next chapter of the crypto market recovery.

This area now stands as a potential pivot point that could determine whether the popular meme coin rebounds toward $0.27 or continues its decline. Analysts are watching the zone closely, suggesting it could be a make-or-break moment for Dogecoin‚Äôs short-term structure. Dogecoin Price Holds IMB Zone As Bulls Eye $0.27 Crypto analyst ‚ÄòBlockchain Baller‚Äô disclosed on X social media on Thursday that Dogecoin has ‚Äútapped the IMB zone after a clean manipulation and structure break,‚Äù signaling the potential end of a corrective phase. At the time, the analyst‚Äôs 4-hour chart showed DOGE hovering around the $0.235 ‚Äì $0.245 region‚Äîan area that historically acts as a liquidity zone where price inefficiencies often get filled before a move higher. Related Reading: Sinking In Minutes: Binance Alpha Token Plunges 99% In Shocking Price Meltdown Blockchain Baller asserts that manipulation and structural breaks are both classic signs that the market may be preparing for a reversal. The analyst notes that price has reacted multiple times in the same region, showing that buyers are stepping in to defend the zone. The chart analysis also highlights the zone between $0.235 and $0.245 as the critical decision point for DOGE bulls. If price climbs back to this level and holds it as support, Blockchain Baller predicts a short-term rebound toward the $0.26 ‚Äì $0.27 range. For a bullish confirmation, the analyst suggests that the price would need to break above ‚Äúshort-term resistance‚Äú with increasing momentum. For now, Dogecoin‚Äôs immediate path seems to depend on how it reacts to the IMB zone. Blockchain Baller has indicated that a strong bounce could mark the beginning of a new impulsive leg, while a breakdown below $0.235 could temporarily delay recovery. Dogecoin Price Targets $6 Amid Market Decline On a broader timeframe, crypto market expert Kaleo has pointed out that Dogecoin‚Äôs market structure is gradually positioning itself for a major upward move. His long-term chart analysis draws striking parallels between DOGE‚Äôs current price action and the previous cycles observed before each Bitcoin halving event. In the past, Dogecoin has consistently broken out from long-term descending triangles shortly after a Bitcoin halving, leading to explosive price rallies. Kaleo‚Äôs chart shows DOGE‚Äôs past rallies from similar formations produced gains of over 20,000% in 2021 and 30,000% in 2027. Dogecoin‚Äôs price action currently mirrors these exact setups, suggesting that its price could be preparing for a historic move again. If history repeats, Kaleo has set DOGE‚Äôs long-term target at $6.9, representing a 3,530% increase from current levels around $0.19. Related Reading: Bitcoin Who? XRP Leads Coinbase Search Charts, Beating The Giants Interestingly, the analyst‚Äôs forecast comes just after a sharp daily crash saw Dogecoin drop about 60% at its lowest point. Market expert Kevin noted that the fall was too extreme to be retail-driven, hinting at systemic exchange failures across Binance, Coinbase, and Robinhood, which temporarily restricted buying during the dip.

Over the past year, he shut down its investment banking operations in Europe and the United States, exited retail markets in France and Argentina, and restructured the group to focus on two core regions, the UK and Hong Kong. In 2024, the bank earned $9.1 billion in pre-tax profit from Hong Kong, meaning 28% of its total, compared with $6.6 billion from the UK. HSBC consolidates Hong Kong operations Analysts have described the takeover as a ‚Äúlong overdue simplification‚Äù of the bank‚Äôs structure in its most profitable market. HSBC first bought a controlling stake in Hang Seng Bank in 1965 when a banking crisis hit Hong Kong. That cemented its position as a dominant local player, and this latest step is seen as an extension of that legacy. S&P Global analysts said, ‚ÄúHong Kong has long been HSBC Holdings‚Äô most profitable home market. We view the proposed transaction as a strategic redeployment of the substantial excess capital it is generating.‚Äù HSBC plans to use its surplus capital to privatize Hang Seng completely, which will eliminate the ‚Äòminority-interest deduction‚Äô ‚Äî an accounting adjustment that reduced HSBC‚Äôs capital buffer because it didn‚Äôt fully own the Hong Kong lender. Georges said, ‚ÄúThe ability to scale investments across both brands across the international network will be enhanced through this alignment. And it is more value generative for our shareholders than a share buyback.‚Äù However, not everyone was impressed. HSBC‚Äôs shares dropped more than 5% at the end of the week, hit by news that it will pause share buybacks until mid-2026. Property crisis adds risk to Hang Seng exposure Behind the financials lies a problem. Hang Seng Bank has ‚Äúclose to 4 million customers,‚Äù nearly all in Hong Kong, and is heavily tied to the local economy. Its core business is retail banking and lending to small and mid-sized firms, but it‚Äôs also exposed to Hong Kong‚Äôs property developers, many of whom are struggling as the city‚Äôs real estate market deteriorates. China‚Äôs property bubble burst in 2021, damaging some of the largest developers in Asia and dragging Hong Kong‚Äôs market along with it after the anti-National Security Law protests and Covid-era lockdowns. This year, Hang Seng‚Äôs pre-tax profits fell 28% to HK$8.1 billion, and its non-performing loan ratio hit 6.7%, which is the highest since 1998. The damage is visible in HSBC‚Äôs group reports. By June, 73% of its Hong Kong commercial real estate loans were listed as impaired or high-risk. According to the Financial Times, Eddie Yue, chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, responded that the city‚Äôs ‚Äúbanking system is well-capitalized and financially strong enough to withstand market volatilities.‚Äù Still, HSBC replaced Hang Seng‚Äôs top management, appointing Luanne Lim, a veteran of the group, as its new CEO. Analysts like Michael Makdad from Morningstar said, ‚Äú[The crisis] is HSBC‚Äôs responsibility; they need to take responsibility for it. If it were a choice between spinning off Hang Seng or taking 100 percent control, then that is what matches their strategy.‚Äù Industry veterans say the move was years in the making. ‚ÄúThis has been a long-term goal for HSBC and now it is more politically possible,‚Äù said one former financial executive. ‚ÄúNow it‚Äôs an easier time to gain control. This gets you the deposit base, and in dealing with the property market, it allows you to manage without minority friction.‚Äù Join Bybit now and claim a $50 bonus in minutes",Business|HSBC,EN,0,0,ASIA|FIAT|MARKET|BUSINESS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-11 20:36:50

Crypto news is dominated by extreme moves and liquidations. For those new to presales, strategy and timing are everything, not hype. The last few days show brutal cleanup in overextended positions, reminding us all that early advantage can be lost quickly. Although many people talk about ‚Äúmoonshots‚Äù, not everyone knows how to realise gains when the tide turns. MAGACOIN FINANCE presents a compelling case study, offering 13x upside from its presale to listing, with many analysts now projecting 50x+ beyond this. New investors can try to capture upside while managing risk before it‚Äôs too late, by using the three tips below. Tip 1: Stage your entry, don‚Äôt go all in When presales open it often feels like ‚Äúnow or never‚Äù. But savvy investors spread out their allocation through different stages. Presales usually work in tiers or chapters. The earlier chapters have lower entry prices. Subsequent chapters get more expensive. If you over-invest early on, the average price you pay could be quite high. And, if the price doesn‚Äôt really go up after the listing, you might end up making a loss. You maintain optionality by allocating portions of your capital to different stages of funding. If the project fails, your losses are capped but if it succeeds, your weighted average will still be good. This technique protects against new entrants‚Äô failures that cause zero or one success. Also, watch how fast each stage sells out. If the stages fill up quickly, it indicates a very high momentum, which in turn increases the chances of a sharp pullback listing. Tip 2: Use partial take-profit triggers around listing Presales come with ready tension: the price is low now and listed price will be higher later. However, spikes created by hype usually overshoot and then go down. To avoid being trapped in a dip, place partial profit take levels close to anticipated listing valuation. As an example, MAGACOIN FINANCE is currently priced at $0.00052564 in presale. Their confirmed listing price is $0.007. This means that MAGACOIN will see a 13x upside in price from presale to listing. This suggests that someone coming in shortly now, riding the listing, and not selling too early could see ~13x in the short-term. You would then multiply that further if the market rotates altcoins and we see some momentum. We can‚Äôt rely on luck, but rather discipline, timing and exit planning. According to several analysts, the first step will be a modest one. Between the presale and listing phases, extreme volatility often occurs, with many tokens experiencing a 10% to 30% pullback just before or after launch. Lock in some gains as the price approaches listing levels. You may remove 25‚Äì50% from the stock price at listing, leaving a portion riding for the longer term (e.g. 50√ó). This hybrid approach strikes a balance between safety and upside capture. Tip 3: Monitor liquidity and exchange listing signals Lack of liquidity is the most significant yet often overlooked risk in presales. If a token fails to get listed on major exchanges, it can stall. On the other hand, projects that secure Tier-1 exchange pledges tend to experience significant demand after listing. Is the project that is listing partners (Binance, Coinbase, KuCoin etc.) track announcements? Are there whitelist or listing guarantee slots? Are third-party integrations or bridge support in motion? Those signals often precede major price pumps. Keep an eye on wallet activity, token unlock schedule, and token vesting. The sudden release of tokens by the team or private investors right after listing can create downward selling pressure. If you encounter large vesting cliffs soon after listing, consider revisiting your take-profit plan. Aligning tips with market dynamics The three tips (staged entry, targeting profits and staying liquid) all align with how speculative capital flows during a reset. Capital allocation tends to flow into the infrastructure first and then, once the hype returns, into presale assets with clear stories. A project like MAGACOIN FINANCE is perfectly positioned for investors. When rotation returns, presale projects that have audited contracts, community momentum and plans to list will become magnets. It‚Äôs all about timing. If you‚Äôre too early, you‚Äôll end up wasting money for no good reason. If you‚Äôre too late, you‚Äôll miss out on profits. If you use these tactics that are based on discipline, you outsmart the risk/reward in your favor. This is especially a space where‚Ä¶ In these unstable, early stages of business, just having conviction without a strategy won‚Äôt make one a winner. One of the secrets to achieving extraordinary gains in the stock market is capital protection, which occurs in different stages. Here are three tactics investors can use to protect capital and position themselves to achieve outsized outcomes. MAGACOIN FINANCE shows the kind of structured presale where some analysts are whispering 13√ó initial return and many are eyeing 50√ó+ upside thereafter. You should use these techniques to smartly manoeuvre around the high-reward zone before it is too late.

Here‚Äôs the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-xrp-is-formally-integrated-into-eurosystem-heres-the-significance/,"A recent post by Crypto researcher, SMQKE, highlighted slides from Italian payments infrastructure provider SIA, asserting that Ripple is formally integrated into the Eurosystem through SIA‚Äôs involvement in ESMIG. The researcher presented this as documented evidence, while others disagreed, stating that SIA‚Äôs support for Ripple-enabled connectivity does not equate to official integration within Eurosystem frameworks. The key issue lies in distinguishing vendor capabilities from institutional implementation. Yes, Ripple is formally integrated into the Eurosystem through its strategic partnership with SIA, an Italian payment infrastructure provider. Documented. https://t.co/WvhpMLg46a pic.twitter.com/9tPx2cN2Dc ‚Äî SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) October 8, 2025 What the SIA Slides Show The first slide outlines SIA‚Äôs role in providing access to critical Eurosystem services through ESMIG. It confirms SIA as an infrastructure provider enabling connections to TARGET2, TIPS, T2S, and ECMS. SIA promotes a fully managed network under SIAnet, offering secure messaging and value-added services, such as validation and message translation. The second slide shifts focus to SIA Chain, their private blockchain and DLT infrastructure. Here, SIA explicitly lists support for multiple distributed ledger technologies, including Corda, Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, and Ripple. A visual diagram also includes Ripple within SIA‚Äôs interoperable network environment, indicating that SIA can interface with Ripple technology as part of its broader technical offerings. Assessing the Interpretation The presented slides confirm that SIA supports Ripple within its private DLT architecture. They also confirm SIA‚Äôs functional role as a connectivity provider to Eurosystem platforms. However, support for a DLT within a vendor‚Äôs network does not demonstrate adoption or integration by the Eurosystem itself. ESMIG, as documented publicly, is an interface standard operated by the Eurosystem for connecting to central banking services. There is no indication within these documents that Ripple is embedded within ESMIG or officially endorsed by the ECB or Eurosystem entities. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The comment challenging the original claim emphasized this distinction, noting that vendor connectivity options should not be confused with institutional usage. The slides do not show Ripple operating within ESMIG architecture; they show SIA offering broader interoperability options to clients that may include Ripple among other technologies. The materials shared offer evidence that SIA includes Ripple among supported DLT platforms within its private network infrastructure. They do not confirm that Ripple is formally integrated into the Eurosystem via ESMIG. Any assertion of official adoption would require documentation from Eurosystem authorities or explicit technical specifications naming Ripple within ESMIG standards. The current evidence reflects SIA‚Äôs interoperability capabilities, not institutional implementation. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

While overall trading volumes remain relatively subdued due to lower average prices, the number of transactions has surged sharply throughout 2025. From Slump to Surge In the first quarter, 7 million NFT sales were recorded, rising to 12.5 million in the second quarter. The momentum accelerated further in Q3, with over 18.1 million NFTs sold, representing a 45% jump from the previous quarter, and generating $1.6 billion in trading volume. Despite this surge in transaction counts, DappRadar stated that actual user adoption remains modest. The number of unique wallets trading NFTs rose from 1.66 million in Q1 to 2.14 million in Q3, a comparatively smaller increase than the spike in sales. This means that individual wallets are trading more NFTs on average, jumping from roughly 4.2 per wallet in Q1 to 8.4 in Q3, which indicates that existing participants are becoming more active rather than new users entering the market. Among NFT categories, gaming has been the notable laggard. DappRadar reported a 17% drop in trading volume and a steep 32% decline in the number of gaming-related NFT transactions over the past quarter. On the other hand, the sports NFT sector has seen an impressive revival, as trading volume of this cohort was up by 337% to $71 million while sales count soared 143% to 4.1 million. The surge is largely attributed to Sorare, the fantasy sports platform offering digital collectibles across football, basketball, and baseball. The platform‚Äôs success, buoyed by the launch of new sports seasons, has helped offset weakness in other sectors. Airdrops and OG NFTs The recent uptick can also be linked to strategic campaigns and revived interest in older projects. A major contributor has been OpenSea‚Äôs campaign ahead of its anticipated token launch, which rewarded active traders and incentivized frequent transactions. This initiative encouraged users to trade lower-value NFTs to qualify for rewards and boosted the platform‚Äôs overall activity. As a result, OpenSea‚Äôs sales count climbed 29% in Q3 to 9.27 million assets sold. Simultaneously, profile picture (PFP) collections have regained prominence, led by blue-chip projects like CryptoPunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), Moonbirds, and Pudgy Penguins. Trading volume for PFPs rose 187% quarter over quarter to $544 million, amidst renewed collector confidence. Adding to the resurgence, Yuga Labs streamlined its portfolio to focus on BAYC, Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC), and Otherside during the same period. Meanwhile, Moonbirds, now under Orange Cap Games, has emerged as Q3‚Äôs standout revival, recording 8,311 NFT sales worth $88 million, owing to the fresh momentum building around its upcoming BIRB token launch on Solana.

An Experienced Name Responds,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/can-we-say-the-bull-run-is-over-for-bitcoin-btc-after-the-latest-crash-an-experienced-name-responds/,"Cryptocurrency analyst Joao Wedson commented on whether the bull cycle in Bitcoin has ended following the recent market decline. Wedson stated that the 4-year Bitcoin cycle is still valid and that current price movements are largely in line with historical cycles. ‚ÄúSome investors are saying the 4-year BTC cycle is over due to global liquidity. However, the Recurrence Fractal Cycle chart, which has been highly accurate since 2015, shows that the cycle is still ongoing,‚Äù Wedson said in his statement. The analyst argued that the Max Intersect SMA Model developed by his team has accurately identified all Bitcoin peaks to date, saying, ‚ÄúIt's surprising that this model has accurately captured the ATH level in every cycle. The question is: Will it hit this cycle as well?‚Äù Related News: Chinese Analytics Firm Founder Reveals the 4 Main Reasons Behind Yesterday's Bitcoin and Altcoin Decline Wedson recalled the market deleveraging process that took place in 2021, reminding that Bitcoin soon rose to a new all-time high during the period when many altcoins reached their peaks. He also noted that on-chain data is still providing strong signals, and the recent major liquidation does not indicate that the market cycle is ending, but rather continuing. Some of the points Wedson makes are: There is no general enthusiasm in the market yet. Some metrics still suggest a new all-time high (ATH) is possible. The total value of the cryptocurrency market is even lower than Nvidia's market capitalization, meaning the sector still has growth potential. Mining fees and other on-chain data are at very low levels. Wedson concluded his statement with the following statements: ‚ÄúIt would be a mistake to think that the market ended solely because of a major liquidation. Historically, such moves have typically created bottoms. The resurgence of Bitcoin's dominance suggests the market could continue for some time, perhaps just a month or so.‚Äù *This is not investment advice.

Before this decline, the crypto market leader led a strong rally to set a new all-time high of $126,198.17 on October 6, 2025. Interestingly, recent data on the Bitcoin Options market indicated a wave of cautious positioning among institutional investors amid this price surge ahead of the current market downturn. Institutions Step Back As Bitcoin‚Äôs Rally Turns Euphoric ‚Äì Glassnode In an X post on October 10, blockchain analytics firm Glassnode lays out some interesting insights in its weekly options market update. Notably, Glassnode analysts report that while Bitcoin prices surged more than 10% in the recent ascent to a new all-time high, institutional traders appear to have maintained a calm market approach, opting to lock in profits and protect downside rather than chase the rally.Despite the steep move higher, implied volatility, i.e., a gauge of expected price swings, barely budged, hovering around 38‚Äì40%. Normally, a rally of that size would push volatility higher as traders hurriedly call and amplify their exposure. However, the silent reaction suggests composure from institutional investors who were already positioned for the move or simply unwilling to pay up for additional upside. Glassnode analysts also draw attention to another subtle but telling sign in option skew. Even at the height of the rally, demand for put options remained strong, keeping the market elevated. This indicates that many large players were selling calls, effectively capping potential upside, through the options market, while maintaining insurance in case the market reversed.In addition, the put-call ratio also reinforces this cautious pattern among institutions. Amidst the option expiry on Friday, October 9, the ratio climbed above 1.0, indicating more puts traded than calls as traders were busy hedging positions ahead of the current downturn rather than chasing momentum and locking in recent gains. Generally, Glassnode describes the Bitcoin market as having adopted a different behavior this cycle, driven by institutional discipline rather than surging volatility and retail exuberance as seen in previous cycles. The dominance of institutional funding driven by spot ETFs and the recent advent of crypto treasury companies may have added a thick layer of maturity to the $2 trillion market. BTC Market Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $110,805 after a 7.54% decline in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, daily trading volume has surged 150.37%, indicating a rise in market activity as traders react to the sharp pullback.",Bitcoin|bitcoin options|Glassnode|implied volatility|Institutions|Spot ETFs,EN,0,0,MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-11 21:30:37

A whale wallet trading on decentralized derivatives exchange Hyperliquid deposited approximately $160 million worth of USDC, opening $1.1 billion in leveraged short positions on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), according to reports. These trades reportedly occurred approximately 30 minutes before US President Donald Trump announced 100% tariffs on China on October 10. The positions in question were allegedly later closed, generating a profit of approximately $190 million to $200 million. However, there is no definitive evidence of insider trading. Related News: Can We Say the Bull Run Is Over for Bitcoin (BTC) After the Latest Crash? An Experienced Name Responds According to data shared by YouTuber and researcher Coffeezilla, the whale opened its last short position, worth approximately $23 million, at 11:49 PM UTC on October 10th. Exactly one minute later, President Trump's statement threatening 100% tariffs on China followed. This announcement triggered the largest liquidation wave in the crypto market in years. Some have claimed that the Trump family profited $192 million from these transactions, but there is no substantiated evidence to support this claim. *This is not investment advice.

Since the dump, crypto natives have been looking for answers, and a common theme has been suspicion of centralized exchanges. Stakeholders and commentators have linked the recent volatility to broader financial market jitters, not unlike the sell-off that rocked US stock markets. However, the speed and scale of the impact on the crypto market have amplified suspicion. Crypto markets endured what is being considered the largest liquidation event in history. Source: Coinglass Speculations on what caused the crash ‚ÄúWord on the street is that big CEX‚Äôs auto liquidation of collateral tied to cross margined positions is why lots of alts got smoked on the move down,‚Äù Arthur Hayes wrote on X. ‚ÄúCongrats to all you stink bidders. We won‚Äôt be seeing those levels any time soon on many high quality alts.‚Äù Another influencer referred to an event that Cryptopolitan reported on Friday , when a whale opened short positions on BTC and ETH two days ahead of the market bloodbath. The wheels were finally set in motion after Trump‚Äôs declaration on October 10, but the market only dipped slightly; nothing too major. Then, a few hours later, a podium announcement seemingly declared trade war on China, causing panic. ‚ÄúStarting November 1, the United States will impose a 100% tariff on all Chinese imports,‚Äù the declaration said and within minutes, the S&P 500 dropped over 2%, Bitcoin plunged to $104K, Ethereum crashed to $3,574 and altcoins bled 60‚Äì90%, all culminating in almost $1T in crypto market cap wiped in under 3 hours. The influencer noted how suspicious the timing was; Thirty minutes before Trump made the official announcement, the same whale doubled its short exposure, and when the crash hit, those positions were closed for an estimated $200M profit. ‚ÄúToo perfect to be a coincidence,‚Äù wrote the influencer, who remains convinced that this value extraction would not start a bear market. According to him, it was a purge, and that is characteristic of bull markets ‚Äî just before they move up another massive leg. While Trump‚Äôs tariffs may have triggered the cascade, what comes now could fuel the next expansion or kill it. Other theories circulating on the internet are linked to insider trading and ‚Äúengineered liquidations‚Äù fueled by on-chain data, and political timing. For now, these claims are more speculative than proven, but they echo the long-standing factors like thin liquidity and whale dominance that made some steer clear of crypto in the early days. Are we in a bear market? First off, it should be noted that the present circumstances do not fit the criteria of past bear markets. However, immature reactions could trigger bearish continuity, threatening past gains. The volatility was triggered in large part by the latest round of tariffs from US President Donald Trump, only days after BTC made a new all-time high. Trump announced on Friday that he would impose an additional 100% tariff on China and export controls on software, causing prices to tumble at a time the market was already showing weakness. Bitcoin , which had touched above $125,000 earlier this week, dipped as low as $104,000 on Saturday before hovering around $112,000 as of publication time. The fall may not look like much, but over the past 24 hours, over $19 billion worth of bets were wiped out, and more than 1.6 million traders got liquidated, according to Coinglass data. More than $7 billion of those positions were reportedly closed in less than an hour of trading on Friday. Coinglass suspects the total might be much higher since exchanges don‚Äôt necessarily report such orders in real time. Binance, for example, only reports one liquidation order per second, the post claims. ‚ÄúThe focus now turns to counterparty exposure and whether this triggers broader market contagion,‚Äù said Brian Strugats, head trader at Multicoin Capital, before adding that some estimates place total liquidations above $30 billion.

With Binance, there were delays and system strains. Now that the dust has settled, the exchange has voluntarily promised to compensate users for the disruption, particularly focusing on issues related to the stablecoin USDe and staking tokens BNSOL and WBETH. Binance commits to making affected traders whole In response to the disaster that hit the market between October 10 and 11, Binance co-founder and Chief Customer Service Officer Yi He has issued a public apology via X (formerly Twitter). She announced the exchange‚Äôs plans to compensate users whose losses were directly attributable to platform issues, rather than normal market fluctuations. ‚ÄúBinance will handle the issues related to Binance,‚Äù she wrote , while emphasizing that there would be no compensation for ‚Äúpersonal trading losses caused by price fluctuations or unrealized losses.‚Äù Teng‚Äôs message was more heartfelt, beginning with an acknowledgment of the turbulent past day and an apology to those impacted. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt make excuses ‚Äî we listen closely, learn from what happened, and are committed to doing better,‚Äù he added . ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre still experiencing any unresolved issues, please reach out to our Binance Support team. Every case will be handled with the care and attention it deserves, and compensation will be provided where applicable.‚Äù Teng ended the message by pointing out that volatility is a part of the market, encouraging users to stay informed and cautious during these times. What happened to Binance during the mayhem? As earlier stated, Binance experienced significant platform strain during the period of extreme market volatility that caused delays in order execution, API latency spikes, and display issues for users‚Äîparticularly impacting staking products, stablecoins, and futures trading. The unprecedented trading volumes led to a massive liquidation cascade across the crypto sector, wiping out approximately $19.3 billion in leveraged positions globally and affecting more than a million traders. The Binance platform was one of the hardest hit, as it accounted for about $2.3 billion of the total liquidations. Its native token was not spared either; the volatility influenced rapid market movements, leading to an almost 10% dump in BNB. So far, only Binance has mentioned anything about compensation; while the general consensus on the timeline was that there was strain during the thick of it, no other exchange has acknowledged it. On October 11, the founder and CEO of OKX took to X with a message that read: ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs market fluctuations, OKX‚Äôs global risk control system has operated stably, with the platform maintaining smooth and steady performance across all regions, and all system indicators remaining at normal levels. OKX will continue to provide stable and reliable services to global users 7√ó24 hours.‚Äù Traders sharing their experiences on X do not agree with the executive, though, as impacted traders demanded investigations, alleging CEX manipulation and demanding lawsuits against non-responsive exchanges. Arthur Hayes also implied that there was more to the liquidations other than market volatility, while Crypto.com‚Äôs CEO called for regulators to look into the events of the day, as Cryptopolitan reported.

Perpetual futures ‚Äî ‚Äúperps‚Äù in trading shorthand ‚Äî are cash-settled contracts with no expiry that mirror spot via funding payments, not delivery. Profits and losses net against a shared margin pool rather than shipped coins, which is why, in stress, venues may need to reallocate exposure quickly to keep books balanced. Colkitt frames ADL as the last step in a risk waterfall. In normal conditions, a blown-up account is liquidated into the order book near its bankruptcy price. If slippage is too severe, venues lean on whatever buffers they maintain ‚Äî insurance funds, programmatic liquidity, or vaults dedicated to absorbing distressed flow. Colkitt notes that such vaults can be lucrative during turmoil because they buy at deep discounts and sell into sharp rebounds; he points to an hour during Friday's crypto meltdown when Hyperliquid‚Äôs vault booked about $40 million. The point, he stresses, is that a vault is not magic. It follows the same rules as any participant and has finite risk capacity. When those defenses are exhausted and a shortfall still remains, the mechanism that preserves solvency is ADL. The analogies in Colkitt‚Äôs explainer make the logic intuitive. He likens the process to an overbooked flight: the airline raises incentives to find volunteers, but if no one bites, ‚Äúsomeone has to be kicked off the plane.‚Äù In perps, when bids and buffers will not absorb the loss, ADL ‚Äúbumps‚Äù part of profitable positions so the market can depart on time and settle obligations. He also reaches for the card room. A player on a hot streak can win table after table until the room effectively runs out of chips; trimming the winner is not punishment, it is how the house keeps the game running when the other side cannot pay. How the queue works When ADL triggers, exchanges apply a rule to decide who gets reduced first. Colkitt describes a queue that blends three factors: unrealized profit, effective leverage, and position size. That math typically pushes large, highly profitable, highly leveraged accounts to the front of the line‚Äî‚Äúthe biggest, most profitable whales get sent home first,‚Äù as he puts it. Reductions are assigned at preset prices tied to the bankrupt side and continue only until the deficit is absorbed. Once the gap closes, normal trading resumes. Traders bristle because ADL can clip a correct position at peak momentum and outside normal execution flow. Colkitt acknowledges the frustration but argues the necessity is structural. Perp markets are zero sum. There is no warehouse of real bitcoin or ether behind a contract, only cash claims moving between longs and shorts. In his words, it is ‚Äújust a big boring pile of cash.‚Äù If a liquidation cannot clear at or above the bankruptcy price and buffers are spent, the venue must rebalance instantly to avoid bad debt and cascading failures. Colkitt emphasizes that ADL should be rare, and most days it is. Standard liquidations and buffers usually do the job, allowing profitable trades to exit on their own terms. The existence of ADL, however, is part of the compact that lets venues offer non-expiring, high-leverage exposure without promising an ‚Äúinfinite stream of losers on the other side.‚Äù It is the final line in the rulebook that keeps the synthetic mirror of spot from cracking under stress. He also argues that ADL exposes the scaffolding that typically stays hidden. Perps build a convincing simulation of the underlying market, but extreme tapes test the illusion. The ‚Äúedge of the simulation‚Äù is when the platform must reveal its accounting and forcibly redistribute exposure to keep parity with spot and stop a cascade. In practice, that means a transparent queue, published parameters, and, increasingly, on-screen indicators that show accounts where they sit in the line. Colkitt‚Äôs broader message is pragmatic. No mechanism can guarantee painless unwinds, only predictable ones. The reason ADL provokes strong reactions is that it strikes winners, not losers, and often at the most visible moment of success. The reason it persists is that it is the only step left once markets refuse to clear and buffers run dry. For now, exchanges are betting that clear rules, visible queues and thicker buffers keep ADL what it should be ‚Äî a backstop you rarely see but never ignore.",Markets|perpetual contracts|Crypto|News,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-10-11 21:58:55

By 2028, SOL is expected to reach a new high of $1,044.17, driven by mainstream adoption of its dApps. Solana‚Äôs price could surpass the $1,000 mark, potentially reaching $2,418.37 or higher by 2031. Despite occasional challenges for the Solana network ecosystem, including network congestion and competition from other blockchain platforms, the current sentiment shows that Solana demonstrates resilience and adaptability, despite the current price fluctuations, positioning itself as a leading player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 landscape. Overall, the prevailing sentiment regarding the current Solana price within the Solana community reflects the current sentiment of confidence and excitement among investors, driven by the growing interest in Solana with stakeholders eagerly anticipating the platform‚Äôs continued evolution and impact on the broader crypto ecosystem. While uncertainties persist, Solana‚Äôs innovative approach, along with its low transaction fees and robust infrastructure instill optimism for its future price action, as indicated by the technical factors and technical analysis.

Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Source: Coinmarketcap Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth¬†with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana‚Äôs (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150. In May the price continued to rise and ended the month above the $165 price level, a trend that could not extend through June as the month saw a decline falling below the $150 price level to end the month. July saw a sharp rise to the asset‚Äôs volatility with SOL crossing the $200 mark. However, the price could not be maintained and SOL ended the month below the $180 level. In August, on the other hand, SOL made strides and managed to close the month above the $205 mark. In September, the volatility rose sharply as the price rose to the $250 price level but failed to maintain the level and ended the month at $230.",Crypto Price Predictions|Solana,EN,0,0,SOL|TRADING|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-11 22:00:00

Whales came in at the $0.25 support point, easing the fall, while retail investors debated whether to buy the dip or wait for clearer trends. Amid this volatility, another crypto went under the radar and silently attracted the attention of savvy investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , now valued at a mere $0.035, has already raised over $17.1 million from over 16,840 investors in its presale. Mutuum Finance combines real-world usability and the type of growth potential that can provide 25x returns. Dogecoin Dips 8% as Whales Step In, Support Holds Near $0.25 Dogecoin (DOGE) fell 8% on Tuesday as whales sold into $0.27 resistance, which caused a billion-token liquidation wave but saw late-session buying near $0.25 suggest a potential technical floor. Traders are closely watching to see if support will prevail over macroeconomic uncertainty, for example, near 98% probability of global monetary easing by year-end that has been behind volatilities in FX and crypto markets. Institutional focus remains in the frame, with ETF submissions by Grayscale and Bitwise maintaining DOGE on broad liquidity conversation, and ongoing mining investment through 2025 is testimony to accumulation and whales‚Äô long-term conviction. Intraday trading experienced sharp declines in the 13:00‚Äì15:00 UTC range but a late-day recovery and double-bottom action supported $0.25 as a significant support, averting an absolute drop into the $0.24 range. Although DOGE‚Äôs survivability serves to prove the durability of established meme-coins, new DeFi project with structured utility, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), is quietly attracting investor attention for its capacity to usher in colossal growth within evolving crypto marketplaces. Mutuum Finance Presale Picking Up Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in Presale Stage 6, having raised more than $17.1 million and having over 16,840 investors to date. This shows growing confidence in the long-term future of the project and makes Mutuum Finance a very attractive ecosystem for those investors seeking sustainable return and long-term value appreciation. The protocol boasts a dynamic Loan-to-Value (LTV) system and liquidation process that react instantaneously to market shocks, infusing stability in times of volatility. Reserve multipliers between 10% to 35%, adjusted based on collateral risk profiles, also provide an added degree of security, making the platform stronger overall. Mutuum Finance also has a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program that classifies vulnerabilities into four levels: critical, major, minor, and low. This proactive detection and prevention system, combined with the open nature of the platform‚Äôs architecture and security-by-design approach, ensures a safe, stable, and robust DeFi protocol for the community.

ETH and USDT will be supported from day one for borrowing, lending, and collateralization, and users will get to experience an open-ended, scalable, and efficient DeFi experience. Mutuum Finance Gains Steam as Dogecoin Falls With Dogecoin (DOGE) down 8% to $0.25, support came in the form of whale buys, but for investors hoping for higher gains, they are targeting Mutuum Finance (MUTM). With a price tag of $0.035 during Stage 6 of its presale, MUTM has garnered over $17.1 million from 16,840+ investors, with over 60% of the tokens already sold. Its Q4 2025 Sepolia Testnet, which will be launched shortly, will feature liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and a liquidator bot, qualifying it as a feature-complete DeFi platform. With dynamic LTV ratios, reserve multipliers of up to 35%, and a $50,000 bug bounty to ensure best-in-class security, Mutuum is designed for stability and growth.

Chart Signals Move To New All-Time High,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoins-pullback-healthy/,"Bitcoin appears to be quietly gathering strength beneath the surface. After a healthy pullback that shook out weak hands, the market is showing signs of renewed momentum. Key technical signals suggest this correction may have been a setup for the next major rally, potentially paving the way for a new all-time high. Healthy Correction Within A Dominant Uptrend EtherNasyonaL, in a recent post, highlighted that Bitcoin continues to maintain its upward trajectory despite recent market fluctuations. The analyst described the latest movement as a healthy correction within the broader bullish trend, emphasizing that such retracements are natural in a sustained rally. Related Reading: Bitcoin Pauses Below Key Levels ‚Äì Can It Regain Momentum For A Rally? Following a rejection from the supply zone, Bitcoin found strong support at a key demand area, where buyers quickly stepped in to defend the price. This rebound underscores the underlying strength of market participants and reaffirms that bullish sentiment remains dominant. EtherNasyonaL¬†noted that short-term volatility, for traders not involved in leveraged positions, often appears as noise in the bigger picture. BTC‚Äôs macro trend is still positive, and the ongoing correction may simply serve as fuel for the next leg higher. Overall, Bitcoin‚Äôs structure remains solid, with its trend intact and momentum still alive. Bullish Spring Formation Points To Possible Breakout Setup Crypto analyst Christopher Inks, in an X post, noted that Bitcoin‚Äôs latest price action has refined its trading range, offering a clearer market structure. He suggested that the asset may have just formed a heavy spring or bullish Swing Failure Pattern (SFP), a setup that often precedes strong upward movement. Related Reading: Here‚Äôs Why The Bitcoin Price Crashed After Hitting $125,700 All-Time High If this bullish setup holds, the analyst expects a validation phase, where Bitcoin could form a higher low on lower volume, a classic sign of successful testing. Such a move would confirm the spring‚Äôs strength and potentially trigger momentum toward a new all-time high (ATH). This phase is critical in determining whether the next major rally is about to begin. Inks also pointed to Open Interest (OI) as a key confirmation tool. A decline in open interest as price consolidates would suggest short covering and validate the bullish test. On the other hand, rising OI on lower closes would imply continued distribution, signaling that the market may need more time before reversing decisively. From an Elliott Wave Theory (EWT) perspective, Inks identified a three-wave structure from the swing low while printing a new swing high that fits a flat correction pattern. Since flat corrections often occur before the continuation of a larger uptrend, this analysis aligns with the Wyckoff interpretation, suggesting Bitcoin‚Äôs structure remains strong and poised for another upward leg.

The decision came after China announced restrictions on rare earth minerals, crucial for technology and manufacturing. BTC plunged as low as $104,000 on some exchanges, with the drop liquidating $6 billion in positions in one hour. The reversal has significantly impacted investor sentiment and market optimism. Bitcoin Traders Must Brace For Volatility Swan Bitcoin CEO Cory Klippsten believes Bitcoin could face substantial volatility as trade tensions between the US and China escalated dramatically. Trump announced 100% tariffs on Chinese imports after the latter announced restrictions on rare earth minerals. ‚ÄúIf the broader risk-off mood holds, Bitcoin can get dragged around a bit before it finds support and starts to decouple again.‚Äù Klippsten added that Bitcoin traders should expect volatility over the next few days as leveraged traders will get flushed out. ‚ÄúMacro-driven dips like this usually wash out leveraged traders and weak hands, then reset positioning for the next leg up.‚Äù Over 2.19 billion in Bitcoin long positions were wiped out over the past 24 hours, adding to a total of over $8 billion in liquidations across the crypto market. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got a little panic in the markets right now, classic macro whiplash. Trump and China are trading tariff threats, equities are off, and traders are scrambling to derisk.‚Äù Despite the market bloodbath, Bitcoin analysts remain optimistic and believe the latest price drop presents a buying opportunity. Bitwise Invest strategist Juan Leon stated, ‚ÄúThe best time to buy BTC has tended to be when it is being dragged down by broader markets.‚Äù Morgan Stanley Drops Restrictions On Crypto Morgan Stanley is reportedly expanding its crypto offerings to allow all its clients to access digital assets. According to reports, the bank will allow customers to trade Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana via its eTrade platform. Advisors will be able to offer customers crypto fund investments, including those with retirement accounts. Previously, only the bank‚Äôs high-net-worth clients could invest in crypto. Morgan Stanley has slowly made inroads into the digital asset space. It began offering wealthy clients access to Bitcoin investment funds in 2021 and allowed financial advisors to promote Bitcoin ETFs to clients in 2024. This year, Morgan Stanley CEO and Chairman Ted Pick stated in an interview that the bank will work with regulators to offer clients access to crypto. ‚ÄúFor us, the equation is really around whether we, as a highly regulated financial institution, can act as transactors.‚Äù The bank also confirmed a partnership with crypto and stablecoin infrastructure fund Zerohash to allow customers to trade Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) fell as the broader cryptocurrency market endured a bloodbath after President Trump imposed 100% tariffs on China in a dramatic escalation of the trade war between the two countries. Trump also imposed import controls on ‚Äúany critical software‚Äù after China announced export restrictions on rare earth minerals critical to tech and other manufacturing. Markets went into turmoil following the announcement, with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and other cryptocurrencies plunging deep into the red. BTC fell as low as $102,000 on Binance before recovering and closing the day at $112,980. President Trump stated on Truth Social, ‚ÄúIt has just been learned that China has taken an extraordinarily aggressive position on Trade in sending an extremely hostile letter to the World, stating that they were going to, effective November 1, 2025, impose large-scale Export Controls on virtually every product they make.‚Äù BTC plunged shortly after the announcement, with analysts worried about a plunge below $100,000. The price stabilized around $102,000, its lowest level since June. Meanwhile, data from CoinGlass revealed that over $9.4 billion in crypto market positions were liquidated in the past 24 hours, with $7.15 billion being leveraged long positions. Ravi Doshi, co-head of markets at FalconX, stated, ‚ÄúA renewed trade war between China and the US erupted on Friday, causing uncertainty in markets and a rout in risk assets.‚Äù Rare earth elements are crucial for semiconductor production. China‚Äôs threat to tighten access to critical materials could strain global supply chains for AI, high-performance computing, and crypto mining infrastructure. The market crash has wiped out ‚ÄúUptober‚Äù euphoria, with the crypto market cap shedding nearly 10% in 24 hours.

Many Trump insiders believe the fraud case against [CZ] was pretty weak, and certainly not something that merited a felony conviction and jail time.‚Äù Zhao was one of the most influential figures in the crypto ecosystem. He was convicted of money laundering by the US Department of Justice, served time, and paid $4.3 billion in fines. Zhao remains the largest individual shareholder at Binance, and a presidential pardon could clear the way for a formal return to the exchange he founded in 2017. Trump Leaning Towards Pardon President Trump and several officials in the White House believe the case against Zhao under the previous administration‚Äôs crypto crackdown was weak and did not merit prison time or felony charges. Gasparino stated that Trump is leaning towards a pardon, but the administration is worried about the optics of a pardon to Zhao, given the president‚Äôs involvement in the digital asset space. The Trump family is deeply involved with various crypto projects through their company, World Liberty Financial. Zhao had revealed in May that he had applied for a pardon from President Trump following his release from prison. However, according to reports, Zhao was denied a pardon at that time. Zhao‚Äôs Conviction Zhao‚Äôs conviction marked the end of one of the most high-profile cases during the Biden administration‚Äôs war on crypto. Prosecutors alleged Binance allowed illicit transactions with sanctioned entities and failed to implement anti-money laundering controls. Zhao pleaded guilty to the charges and stepped down as the CEO of Binance. He also paid $50 million in fines, while Binance paid $4.3 billion. Zhao served a four-month prison sentence in a low-security federal prison in California and in a halfway house. Several individuals have questioned whether the charges against Zhao were warranted. Meanwhile, Trump‚Äôs team sees Zhao‚Äôs situation as an opportunity to demonstrate a new era of crypto policy. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

53009376,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=833940,1760221244,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53009376.jpeg,"OpenAI becomes a $500 billion private powerhouse, reshaping Silicon Valley with secretive spending and nonstop expansion",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/openais-grip-on-silicon-valley/,"OpenAI has changed how Silicon Valley operates, turning the old startup survival game into something far more unpredictable. The company, which remains privately held and secretive about its finances, has built a reputation for spending other people‚Äôs money faster and louder than any tech giant has ever done before. According to CNBC, its expansion up and down the stack (from massive data centers to coding tools and consumer devices) has left the startup scene struggling to find breathing space. In less than three years, OpenAI has gone from a startup led by ex‚ÄìY Combinator head Sam Altman to a $500 billion heavyweight. It is now building data centers approved by the White House and teaming with Nvidia, the world‚Äôs most valuable company. OpenAI‚Äôs flagship ChatGPT chatbot now serves 800 million users every week, while its new Sora video app hit one million downloads in under five days. At DevDay in San Francisco, attended by around 1,500 developers, Sam announced that Codex, the company‚Äôs software engineering agent, is now fully available, and Sora 2 can be accessed through the API. Investors chase niches as OpenAI dominates every lane Nina Achadjian, a partner at Index Ventures, said the biggest question for entrepreneurs is, ‚ÄúWhere is the white space?‚Äù Her firm just led a $25 million round in Quilter, a startup using AI for printed circuit boards, founded in 2019 by ex-SpaceX engineer Sergiy Nesterenko. Nina described the company as ‚Äúpretty niche‚Äù and ‚Äúnot built on top of any model.‚Äù She explained that OpenAI probably won‚Äôt compete in such a deep engineering space dominated by firms like Cadence Design and Synopsys, but still, ‚Äúthere is no predictability,‚Äù she said. Relative to past cycles, ‚Äúit‚Äôs more opaque and hard to predict which direction those guys are going to go.‚Äù At DevDay, Sam appeared on stage with Jony Ive, the designer behind the iPhone, who joined OpenAI in May as part of a $6.4 billion talent deal to build AI hardware. Jony said his goal was to create tools that ‚Äúmake us happy and fulfilled and more peaceful and less anxious and less disconnected.‚Äù He refused to say what exactly he was building. Still, the company‚Äôs nonstop expansion has made it the center of the AI world, much like Amazon in e-commerce, Google in search, Facebook in social media, and Apple in mobile. Ethan Kurzweil, managing partner at Chemistry Ventures, said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the fastest-moving time in startup creation and disruption in my 17 years of investing.‚Äù He said OpenAI is rolling out services that compete directly with tools built on top of ChatGPT, and even that hasn‚Äôt slowed investment. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a gold rush mentality where a lot of companies will do well,‚Äù he said. AI cash floods the market as moats disappear At a September event hosted by Chemistry, OpenAI‚Äôs COO Brad Lightcap told attendees there are no ‚Äútechnical moats‚Äù anymore. Competing models from Anthropic, Google, and Meta prove the fight is about momentum, not technology. Index Ventures‚Äô Nina said the lack of public oversight gives OpenAI and Anthropic freedom to burn through cash. Anthropic raised $13 billion last month at a $183 billion valuation. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no reckoning, because none of the companies are public,‚Äù she said . ‚ÄúThat further fosters the exuberance of capital raising, capital spending and vertical integration. In the first half of 2025, venture capital growth-stage funding reached $83.9 billion, driven by five billion-dollar AI deals. On that pace, 2025 will surpass 2021‚Äôs record $96.1 billion. ‚ÄúAI continues to dominate the upper end of the deal spectrum,‚Äù said a report from Pitchbook and the National Venture Capital Association. Meanwhile, Exa Labs, founded in 2021, raised $85 million in September at a $700 million valuation from investors including Nvidia. Exa co-founder Jeff Wang said that hobbyists and people building AI products are paying for Exa‚Äôs service, and that it‚Äôs being used within companies that have specific and ‚Äúgigantic needs.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe pie is really big and OpenAI is just one company,‚Äù Jeff said.

Marszalek has taken to X and voiced his opinion about the widespread liquidations, which surpassed previous market crashes, including the one caused by FTX. Regulators should probe crypto exchanges He wrote, ‚ÄúRegulators should look into the exchanges that had most liquidations in the last 24h and conduct a thorough review of fairness of practices.‚Äù Marszalek is concerned that some exchanges failed to treat traders fairly, mispriced assets, or prevented withdrawal requests. Cryptopolitan reported that some centralized exchanges faced major congestion during market liquidation. That led to widespread technical issues resulting in frozen apps and stuck order books. Some people were even locked out of their accounts during market turbulence, causing huge losses. Moreover, Marszalek questioned whether exchanges have a robust setup to monitor trades and if there are any anti-money laundering (AML) programmes in place. He voiced his concerns and said, ‚Äú$20B in liquidations, a lot of users got hurt. The job of regulatory bodies is to protect the consumers and assure market integrity. Hyperliquid faced the biggest liquidations of $10.31 billion. ByBit and Binance ranked second and third with $4.65 billion and $2.41 billion being wiped out, respectively. OKX saw liquidations of $1.21 billion, while HTX and Gate traders lost $362.5 million and $264.5 million, respectively, based on aggregated data from CoinGlass. On the other hand, DeFi platforms passed the stress test with flying colors. Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) such as Uniswap and Aave handled the market turbulence with zero technical issues and no interruptions. Aave handled $180 million in liquidations flawlessly and without any human intervention, while Uniswap processed close to $9 billion in trades as reported by Cryptopolitan. The crypto market sentiment is labeled ‚ÄúFear‚Äù as of October 11. Bitcoin is trading at $110,988 while Ethereum is hovering around $3,733.05 based on CoinGecko data . Despite the major liquidation, privacy coins are still trending up by 2.4% with Zcash trading at $287.50 while Monero is about to reach $300.

The October 10 crash, triggered by renewed trade tensions between Washington and Beijing, sent shockwaves through both traditional and digital markets. Analysts say the downturn tested the resilience of the sector‚Äôs liquidity systems but has also sparked a quick rebound in on-chain activity. Investors buy the dip as Tether, Circle mint new stablecoins Data from on-chain analytics platform Lookonchain showed that Tether and Circle, issuers of USDT and USDC, respectively, minted a combined $1.75 billion in new stablecoins in the immediate aftermath of the crash. In a post on X, the analytics firm said the new issuance reflected ‚Äúliquidity injection‚Äù as investors repositioned into dollar-pegged assets during the sell-off. Not everyone was retreating. Blockchain analytics also revealed that Bitmine, one of the sector‚Äôs largest digital asset investors, bought 27,256 ETH, worth around $104.24 million, during the downturn. The purchase came as part of what market observers describe as bottom-fishing by whales seeking discounted assets ahead of a possible rebound. Bitmine( @BitMNR ) just bought another 27,256 $ETH (104.24M). Tom Lee said that today's dip was a good shakeout and the market is likely to rise in a week. https://t.co/RT53NaLoMF https://t.co/qlNEWX7DLQ pic.twitter.com/4Ighq8PpX6 ‚Äî Lookonchain (@lookonchain) October 11, 2025 Tom Lee, Wall Street strategist and Head of Research at Fundstrat, shared his insights on the current state of the market and how investors will likely react, calling the event ‚Äúa good shakeout,‚Äù and adding that the market was likely to rise in a week. Andrei Grachev, managing partner at DWF Labs, shares similar sentiments. He described the crash as the product of technical liquidations rather than a collapse in fundamentals. ‚ÄúThis crash happened not because of fundamentals like the FTX collapse,‚Äù Grachev wrote on X . ‚ÄúIt was because of the tariffs announcement and following leveraged liquidations. Liquidity got drained, but Bitcoin and strong projects should recover quite soon. DYOR .‚Äù The journey to recovery The speed of the post-crash adjustments shows how much more automated and liquid the crypto ecosystem has become since the major market disruptions of 2022. Within hours of the sell-off, stablecoin supplies expanded, liquidity pools rebalanced, and DeFi protocols such as Aave and Uniswap reported record transaction volumes with minimal downtime . Analysts say that if the market stabilizes in the coming days, this episode may be remembered less as a crash than as a liquidity test, one that key crypto institutions appeared ready to pass. However, if macroeconomic tensions escalate with Trump making another decision that sends panic into the market or a major liquidity crunch hits the stablecoin market, the recovery could stall. Lee also pointed out, as he said, ‚ÄúUnless there‚Äôs a real structural change, this pullback is a buying opportunity.‚Äù So far, the tone across the crypto sector is shifting from fear to measured optimism, and as Grachev noted, the turbulence may have been a test rather than a reckoning; ‚ÄúBitcoin and strong projects should recover quite soon.‚Äù Get seen where it counts.

The policy, set to take effect on November 1 , rattled investors globally and unleashed the most severe wave of crypto liquidations seen in years. The fallout was immediate. Within hours, the crypto market shed more than $200 billion in value, with leveraged positions collapsing across major exchanges. Bitcoin (BTC) plunged below $106,000 before recovering to $112,000 , while Ethereum (ETH) rebounded from $3,500 to $3,800 after intense panic selling. Meanwhile, XRP and Solana (SOL) fell 13.5% and 16.1% , respectively, as liquidity evaporated. According to data, over $19.3 billion worth of leveraged positions were liquidated within 24 hours, impacting more than 1.6 million traders . Analysts described the event as ‚Äúpanic-driven,‚Äù spurred by fears of a prolonged U.S. ‚Äì China trade war that could reshape capital flows for the rest of 2025. Despite the carnage, key altcoins have begun to show remarkable resilience, particularly in sectors that blend utility with cultural momentum. Among them, MemeCore and MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out as bright spots in an otherwise battered market. MAGACOIN FINANCE Emerges as a Post-Crash Power Player Amid the chaos, MAGACOIN FINANCE has drawn growing attention for its strength, structure, and staying power. While many tokens struggled to maintain visibility during the crash, MAGACOIN FINANCE continued building momentum through its $16 million+ presale milestone, HashEx and CertiK audits, and scarcity-driven tokenomics. Its community presence on X and Telegram remains one of the most active in the altcoin space, providing consistent visibility even as markets turned red. Analysts projecting 50√ó upside potential say that MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a strategic accumulation target for investors seeking growth exposure without overleveraging. What makes MAGACOIN FINANCE notable in this cycle is its contrast to speculative meme assets, it blends cultural relevance with audit-backed credibility , bridging a gap that has long divided crypto retail enthusiasm from institutional confidence. As capital rotates from short-term trades to projects with stronger foundations, MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äôs clear roadmap and token structure position it as a natural beneficiary of post-crash capital reallocation. Market watchers note that volatility tends to accelerate the discovery of quality projects. In that context, MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äôs continued growth during one of the worst crashes in crypto history signals that it‚Äôs not merely surviving turbulence, it‚Äôs thriving within it. MemeCore Defies Market Panic with Proof-of-Meme Innovation While nearly every token posted double-digit losses, MemeCore (MEME) shocked analysts by gaining 7.87% in 24 hours and 6.07% on the week , defying the selloff. Trading volume more than doubled to $39.8 million , even as broader liquidity dried up. The project‚Äôs strength comes from its Proof-of-Meme (PoM) consensus mechanism, a creative spin on blockchain validation that rewards community engagement and meme-driven activity rather than traditional staking or mining. This innovation, paired with EVM compatibility , attracted retail traders seeking stability within a familiar Layer 1 ecosystem. MemeCore‚Äôs total market cap has now reached $2.32 billion , cementing it as one of the top-performing Layer 1s of 2025. The upcoming MemeX Festival on October 15 is also generating excitement, as it promises to showcase a wave of new meme-based applications and NFT integrations built on the platform. Analysts at CoinMarketCap‚Äôs momentum desk note that MemeCore‚Äôs performance highlights an emerging pattern: in moments of macro fear, traders are shifting from high-beta DeFi and AI tokens toward community-led, culturally resilient ecosystems . However, experts caution that the project‚Äôs relatively low liquidity compared to its market cap could amplify volatility during sharp market moves. Even with that caveat, MemeCore‚Äôs ability to rally during the sharpest market drop of 2025 underscores its growing role as a niche safe haven for retail sentiment. The Road Ahead: From Capitulation to Confidence This week‚Äôs $20 billion liquidation was a harsh reminder of crypto‚Äôs vulnerability to macro shocks. Yet, as seen in prior cycles, these events often serve as catalysts for renewal. Institutional buying near Bitcoin‚Äôs lows suggests that large players are treating this panic as an accumulation opportunity. Meanwhile, resilient altcoins like MemeCore and MAGACOIN FINANCE are capturing the imagination of retail investors seeking both innovation and stability. With the market rebounding from the brink, the coming weeks will test whether these altcoins can sustain their momentum amid geopolitical uncertainty. If they can, both MemeCore‚Äôs cultural narrative and MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äôs scarcity-backed framework may define the recovery phase leading into 2026.

According to his assessment, XRP could serve as a foundation for a new upward movement as liquidity shifts across global financial markets. Rietveld explained that the stock market is currently setting new all-time highs, while the crypto market undergoes a temporary correction. He observed that this pattern has occurred before, most notably earlier in the year, when a surge followed rising equity markets in cryptocurrency valuations. In his view, the present setup mirrors those conditions, suggesting that capital from traditional assets could soon flow into the digital asset space. The MOST Important #XRP Video You Will Ever Watch! pic.twitter.com/W0wh6RxBa9 ‚Äî Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) October 9, 2025 XRP Positioned for Market Rebound Rietveld maintained that XRP‚Äôs market structure indicates growing strength, particularly as it continues to hold above long-term support zones . He expects that the next wave of liquidity entering the crypto market will likely benefit assets such as XRP, which he considers well-positioned for the next stage of growth. His outlook remains optimistic, supported by the ongoing increase in institutional participation and the gradual recovery of investor sentiment following recent corrections. He further noted that as market cycles repeat, patience and awareness of key technical zones are essential. The current phase, he argued, offers investors an opportunity to accumulate at attractive prices before broader market momentum resumes. He pointed out that the cyclical flow of capital, which moves from traditional stocks to digital assets, has consistently preceded bullish phases in cryptocurrency. Institutional Adoption Accelerating Rietveld highlighted a growing trend among institutional investors who are increasing their exposure to digital assets. He cited recent reports showing that over 60% of institutional investors plan to acquire more cryptocurrency in the near term, viewing it as a hedge against the weakening fiat system. He also referenced Luxembourg‚Äôs sovereign wealth fund, which recently allocated one percent of its portfolio to spot Bitcoin ETFs, as an example of major financial institutions entering the space with long-term confidence. He described this move as a sign of broader acceptance of blockchain-based assets and a precursor to large-scale capital inflows. According to Rietveld, sovereign wealth funds across Europe, as well as major U.S. investment institutions, are preparing to expand their digital asset holdings, marking a major turning point for global markets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A Shift Away from Fiat Dependence Rietveld was critical of the traditional monetary system, particularly the practices of central banks that rely on creating debt and devaluing currency. He argued that this system is fundamentally unsustainable and continues to erode public trust. In contrast, he said that cryptocurrencies such as XRP represent a more transparent and efficient alternative capable of restoring balance to the global financial system. He added that as inflation and debt concerns grow worldwide, people are beginning to recognize the advantages of decentralized digital currencies. In his view, the gradual loss of confidence in fiat money is accelerating the adoption of blockchain-based solutions. He emphasized that XRP and other digital assets offer a path toward financial independence by providing an escape from the flaws of centralized monetary control.

Wildberger said the goal is digital sovereignty, not isolation, explaining that Germany and the European Union must act as players in the technology sector rather than customers. ‚ÄúWe need to actively participate in this sector as players, not as customers,‚Äù he said. This comes as many Europeans grow uneasy about U.S. President Donald Trump‚Äôs trade policies , which focus heavily on promoting American interests and have pushed some European governments and businesses to look for alternatives to U.S. technology providers that dominate everything from cloud services to AI infrastructure. Wildberger said Europe must not stay dependent when ‚Äúthere is a huge growth market for technology, innovation, software, data and artificial intelligence.‚Äù Germany demands real control over data and infrastructure Wildberger said that Germany and Europe have already built impressive players in the field, naming Mistral AI, DeepL, and Aleph Alpha as proof that the continent can compete globally. But the German lawmaker admitted that the U.S. still leads in several core areas, especially in artificial intelligence, and that cooperation will remain necessary. ‚ÄúDigital sovereignty doesn‚Äôt mean protectionism,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe want to and must be accessible for the global market.‚Äù Asked about fears that Trump might disrupt transatlantic partnerships, Wildberger downplayed them. ‚ÄúU.S. companies of course also continue to be interested in doing business abroad,‚Äù he said, but added that German firms must be able to choose who they work with, where they store their data, and who runs their digital infrastructure. For Wildberger, digital sovereignty reportedly means rethinking the entire supply chain from rare earth materials and chip design to servers and undersea cables that make the modern internet possible. Europe keeps leaning on US hyperscalers despite new policies Meanwhile, at the Forrester Technology & Innovation Summit EMEA in London, Forrester predicted that Europe will intensify its push to reduce dependence on global providers and take more control over its technology stack. But despite all that effort, no European company will fully detach from U.S. hyperscalers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud by 2026. Analysts linked this continued dependence to geopolitical tensions, economic instability, and strict new laws such as the European Green Deal and the EU AI Act, both of which restrict experimental, high-risk technology use. These conditions, they said, will force European businesses to keep working with American cloud providers that already dominate the market. The same report said that consumer use of generative AI across Europe will double by 2026, but enterprise adoption will still lag far behind the United States due to tighter regulations and less-developed AI ecosystems. The United Kingdom, however, is expected to move faster because of lighter rules and fewer language barriers. The study also predicted that EU defense spending would bring a 20% increase in technology budgets for public infrastructure. This comes after NATO members agreed in June 2025 to lift defense spending to 5% of GDP, with 1.5% of that set aside for ‚Äúenabling infrastructure.‚Äù Finally, it warned that Britain‚Äôs AI policies could backfire. The UK government‚Äôs enthusiasm for U.S. technology firms like Anthropic and OpenAI, its refusal to sign global AI governance agreements, and its lack of binding regulation could erode public trust even as productivity rises.

The decision to offload its chemicals division follows the surge in demand for AI infrastructure, as companies across the technology sector realign their strategies to benefit from the innovation boom. MKS moves for semiconductor growth MKS Instruments, a Massachusetts-based supplier to major semiconductor manufacturers including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company ( TSMC ), is preparing to sell a $1B specialty chemicals division, which it acquired as part of its $5.1B takeover of Atotech in 2021. The division up for sale brings in roughly $100M in adjusted annual earnings and its major function is to supply the technology used to apply coatings and finishes to cars and industrial equipment. MKS intends to keep the parts of the business that produce equipment for semiconductor and circuit board manufacturing. The sale process is reportedly at an advanced stage, but there is no guarantee a deal will be finalized. The company‚Äôs shares closed at $121.30 on Friday, representing an increase of 14.4% year-to-date, giving it a market capitalization of $8.3B. Markets are closed over the weekend, but MKS stock closed Friday at around $121.26. Source: Google Finance AI demand fuels investor confidence In recent months, MKS has attempted to persuade investors that its tools and systems are important to fulfilling the surge in semiconductor demand. The company supplies some of the world‚Äôs largest chipmakers, including TSMC, Applied Materials, and Lam Research. During its August earnings call, Chief Executive John Lee said that the company‚Äôs double-digit growth in its electronics and packaging departments shows the growing complexity of modern electronics applications and validates the firm‚Äôs role in supporting innovation. ‚ÄúComplex electronics applications like AI are driving growth,‚Äù Lee said. MKS‚Äôs semiconductor and electronics divisions delivered revenue growth that exceeded analyst expectations in the most recent quarter. The global AI boom , led by rising demand for data center infrastructure and advanced chips from companies like Nvidia, TSMC, and Intel, has triggered a wave of investment in the semiconductor supply chain. MKS has benefited directly from this momentum due to chipmakers expanding production capacity and seeking more advanced tools to meet processing demands. The sale of MKS‚Äôs chemicals division has reportedly attracted interest from a range of strategic buyers and private equity firms. Earlier this month, Carlyle Group struck a ‚Ç¨7.7B deal to acquire a majority stake in BASF‚Äôs coatings unit, with BASF retaining a minority share. Notably, Carlyle previously owned 79% of Atotech before MKS acquired it in 2021.

Optimism price prediction for 2028 suggests the token could reach a maximum value of $11.14. In 2031, OP tokens will range between $27.9 and $33.66, with an average value of $28.88. Optimism‚Äôs (OP) commitment to innovation is highlighted by its support for Layer-3 solutions. These solutions enable the development of decentralized applications (dApps) on top of Layer-2 chains, contributing to the expansive Optimism Superchain. The platform‚Äôs initiatives, including introducing custom gas tokens and Plasma mode aimed at reducing onboarding and operational costs, make it more accessible for new users and developers. As the market closely watches the price movements and growth trajectory of the token, can Optimism reach $10 soon? Let‚Äôs get into the OP price prediction for 2025 ‚Äì 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Optimism Token OP Price $0.4512 Market Cap $787.13B Trading Volume $571.76M Circulating Supply 1.778B OP All-time High $4.85 (Mar 06, 2024) All-time Low $0.4005 (Jun 18, 2022) 24-hour High $0.607 24-hour Low $0.3408 Optimism price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 7.10% 50-Day SMA $0.7274 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 27 (Fear) Green Days 14/30 (47%) 200-Day SMA $0.7524 Optimism price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: OP is severely oversold after dropping below $0.50, but bearish momentum is still strong. The 4-hour chart shows minor stabilization, though volume and MACD remain weak. Optimism 1-day price chart The OP/USDT daily candle for October 11 shows continued downside follow-through after the major breakdown below $0.55. Price now sits below the lower Bollinger band at $0.5293, suggesting the market is deeply oversold and under strong bearish control. OPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD remains firmly bearish, with both lines diverging lower and no sign of a crossover. The histogram bars have expanded downward, showing that momentum continues to favor sellers. Volume has surged to 83.4M, indicating panic-driven liquidation rather than bottom accumulation. Unless the price closes back above $0.50 soon, OP risks sliding further toward the next supports around $0.42 and $0.39. Bulls need a daily close above $0.50‚Äì$0.53 to regain short-term stability. Optimism 4-hour price chart On the 4-hour timeframe, OP is attempting to base around $0.45 after a sharp decline, but the structure remains fragile. The Alligator lines are strongly fanned out to the downside, confirming a solid bearish trend. However, they‚Äôre beginning to slightly flatten, hinting that selling pressure may be easing slightly in the short term. OPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The RSI has lifted from extreme lows near 15 to around 30, which suggests the token is oversold but trying to stabilize. Still, this is not yet a confirmed reversal, merely a pause in downside momentum. The OBV continues to trend lower at 67.7M, indicating no fresh accumulation. Immediate resistance sits around $0.50‚Äì$0.52 (the green Alligator line), which aligns with the lower boundary of the prior consolidation zone. A bounce toward this area would likely face rejection unless volume picks up significantly. On the downside, $0.43 remains the nearest support, followed by $0.40.

OP remains under heavy bearish pressure, with no clear reversal signals yet. The current setup suggests a short-term consolidation or small relief bounce could form between $0.43‚Äì$0.50, but the overall direction remains downward until a daily close above $0.53 confirms strength. For now, any rebound should be seen as corrective rather than the start of a new uptrend. Is Optimism a good crypto investment? Optimism (OP) could be a good investment if you believe in Ethereum scaling and the growth of Layer 2 solutions. However, like all crypto, it‚Äôs risky, and its value depends on adoption and market trends. Only invest what you‚Äôre willing to lose! Will OP recover? A recovery is possible, but we fear the overall bearish sentiment makes a short-term rebound unlikely. However, as the market consolidates, we expect reduced volatility, which may lead to a breakout in either direction, depending on market dynamics. Will Optimism reach $10? Yes, Optimism is projected to close up to $10 by 2028. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in its price. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and require unprecedented growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook.

Optimism historic price sentiment Optimism price history by Coingecko OP launched with an initial value of $4.57 on May 31 but dropped sharply in June due to the UST stablecoin de-pegging and LUNA collapse, closing June at $0.5434. It further declined to $0.4147 by mid-July. In August, OP briefly surged above $1.90, but by mid-October, it dropped to $0.70 following the FTX collapse. In Q1 2023, OP surged past $3.00 during a crypto bull run but lost 66% shortly after. A recovery saw it close the year at $3.90. OP saw an eventful 2024, reaching an all-time high of $4.85 in March before sliding below $2.30 by mid-April. After a brief recovery to over $2.90 in May, it entered a bearish phase, trading at $1.82‚Äì$1.96 by July and $1.54‚Äì$1.62 by October. November brought a spark of hope with a peak at $2.60. OP closed December within the range of $1.611‚Äì$2.773. In January 2025, OP peaked at $2.18 but lost momentum, dropping to as low as $0.84 in February.

What looked like a hold above $0.25 turned into a fast breakdown that dragged the Dogecoin price to as low as $0.148 within 24 hours. However, technical analysis from crypto analyst Kaleo shows Dogecoin is ready to hit new all-time highs. In a post on X, he doubled down on a remarkably bullish prediction, stating that $6.90 is a ‚Äúmagnet‚Äù for Dogecoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Who? XRP Leads Coinbase Search Charts, Beating The Giants Dogecoin Chart Tells The Story In his post on the social media platform X, Kaleo noted how members of the crypto community are increasingly waking up to see how primed Dogecoin is to reach higher levels. The chart accompanying Kaleo‚Äôs post shows the historical pattern that Dogecoin has followed after previous Bitcoin halvings. Each halving has always been followed by years of massive upside moves in Dogecoin‚Äôs price, with the meme coin breaking out of long-term descending resistance lines to record exponential gains. Examples shown in this chart are the 2017 and 2021 explosive price surges. Kaleo suggested that the current market phase mirrors the same structure seen just before the 2021 bull run, when Dogecoin broke above a key lower-high resistance from its previous all-time high. This moment is illustrated on the chart with the label ‚ÄúWe are here.‚Äù Dogecoin Price Chart. Source: @CryptoKaleo on X The $6.90 Magnet: Kaleo‚Äôs Logic Behind The Forecast Kaleo acknowledged that the projection of a $6.9 Dogecoin price target might sound a little too bullish, but his logic is based on the logic of market cap math. In his post, he explained that his projection for Bitcoin this cycle is to surpass $500,000. If Bitcoin surpasses $500,000 as expected, it would translate to a $10 trillion market capitalization. This sheer amount of inflow would flow into the rest of the crypto market, and Dogecoin could theoretically reach 10% of Bitcoin‚Äôs valuation, just as it did during the 2021 mania. That ratio implies a $1 trillion market cap for Dogecoin, which is equivalent to a $6.94 price per token based on the current circulating supply. Dogecoin‚Äôs recent price crash has complicated this bullish narrative. Instead of confirming an imminent breakout, the meme coin has fallen below the $0.25 support level. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.1971, down by 21.4% in the past 24 hours and having reached an intraday low of $0.1489.

Yet, it also risks extending Dogecoin‚Äôs bearish structure and delaying any breakout if the price fails to recover quickly. Right now, recovery above $0.25 is important for bulls to rebuild bullish momentum.

Prominent market commentator Chad Steingraber described the incident as an ‚ÄúXRP Black Swan,‚Äù pointing to the scale of losses that accompanied the broader market crash on October 10. The global financial landscape suffered a sudden shock following an unexpected policy announcement by U.S. President Donald Trump, who declared that his administration would introduce an additional 100% tariff on goods imported from China. The move reignited fears of a renewed trade conflict between the world‚Äôs two largest economies, sparking heavy sell-offs across equities, commodities, and digital assets. As panic spread, the total value of the cryptocurrency market dropped below $4 trillion, landing around $3.7 trillion. Billions of dollars in leveraged positions were liquidated within hours, leaving the market in one of its most volatile trading sessions to date. History made with an XRP Black Swan The biggest XRP LONG liquidation ever at nearly HALF A BILLION ‚Äì> $422.103Million https://t.co/hFZhOFQj1g pic.twitter.com/AQb3YKO4xS ‚Äî Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) October 10, 2025 XRP Drops $1.27 in a Single Day Before the sell-off began, XRP had been trading in a relatively stable range around $2.80, showing moderate strength despite broader market uncertainty. However, the sudden wave of panic selling erased those gains. By the afternoon of October 10 (UTC), the token had fallen sharply, reaching an intraday low of $1.53, a loss of approximately $1.27 within hours. Despite the steep fall, XRP later regained some ground as buyers stepped in to stabilize prices. The asset closed the day at $2.35, reflecting a significant recovery from its daily low but still ending the session in negative territory. Data from CoinGlass confirmed that the turbulence triggered one of the largest liquidation events ever recorded in the crypto sector. Within a 12-hour window, more than $19 billion worth of leveraged positions were wiped out across major exchanges. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Of this amount, long traders absorbed most of the impact, losing around $16.7 billion, while short traders accounted for roughly $2.4 billion in liquidations. Updated figures later in the day showed the total amount of liquidations rising slightly to $19.31 billion, as both long and short traders continued to face margin calls amid the persistent volatility. ‚ÄòXRP Black Swan‚Äô Becomes a Defining Moment According to Steingraber , XRP‚Äôs price collapse represented the largest single-session liquidation event in the token‚Äôs history. He referred to it as an ‚ÄúXRP Black Swan,‚Äù emphasizing the scale and suddenness of the market reaction. CoinGlass data supported this assessment, showing that XRP traders collectively lost $707 million over the past 24 hours. Long positions bore the majority of the losses, totaling $615.46 million, while short positions accounted for approximately $91.96 million. Analysts have noted that this is the most severe liquidation event XRP has experienced since its inception. Currently, XRP is trading around $2.47, marking a 12.13% decline over the previous 24 hours and extending its weekly drop to 17.43%. The event underscores the growing fragility of leveraged trading in the digital asset market and highlights how swiftly sentiment can reverse in reaction to geopolitical developments.

Perpetual futures ‚Äî ‚Äúperps‚Äù in trading shorthand ‚Äî are cash-settled contracts with no expiry that mirror spot via funding payments, not delivery. Profits and losses net against a shared margin pool, which is why, in stress, venues may need to reallocate exposure quickly to keep books balanced. Man, who is the lead portfolio manager of the Bitwise Multi-Strategy Alpha Fund, said bitcoin fell 13% from peak to trough in a single hour, while losses in long-tail tokens were far steeper ‚Äî he added that ATOM ‚Äúfell to virtually zero‚Äù on some venues before rebounding. He estimated roughly $65 billion in open interest was erased, resetting positioning to levels last seen in July. The headline numbers, he argued, mattered less than the plumbing: when uncertainty spikes, liquidity providers widen quotes or step back to manage inventory and capital, organic liquidations stop clearing at bankruptcy prices, and venues turn to emergency tools. According to Man, exchanges in that situation leaned on safety valves. He said auto-deleveraging kicked in at some venues, forcibly closing part of profitable counter-positions when there was not enough cash on the losing side to pay winners. He also pointed to liquidity vaults that absorb distressed flow ‚Äî Hyperliquid‚Äôs HLP ‚Äúhad an extremely profitable day,‚Äù he said, buying at deep discounts and selling into spikes. What failed and what held Man said centralized venues saw the most dramatic dislocations as order books thinned, which is why long-tail tokens broke harder than bitcoin and ether. By contrast, he said DeFi liquidations were muted for two reasons: major lending protocols tend to accept blue-chip collateral such as BTC and ETH, and Aave and Morpho ‚Äúhardcoded USDe‚Äôs price to $1,‚Äù limiting cascade risk. Although USDe remained solvent, he said it traded around $0.65 on centralized exchanges amid illiquidity ‚Äî leaving users who posted it as margin on those venues vulnerable to liquidation. Beyond directional traders, Man highlighted hidden exposures for market-neutral funds. He said the real risks on days like Friday are operational ‚Äî algorithms running, exchanges staying up, accurate marks, the ability to move margin and execute hedges on time. He checked in with several managers who reported they were fine, but said he would not be surprised if ‚Äúsome c-tier trading teams got carried out.‚Äù Man also described unusually wide dispersion across venues, citing $300-plus spreads at times between Binance and Hyperliquid on ETH-USD. Prices recovered from extreme lows, he said, and positioning flushes created opportunities for traders with dry powder. Man also mentioned that with open interest down sharply, markets entered the weekend on firmer footing than the day before.",Markets|Crypto|Markets|perpetual contracts|Liquidations|News,EN,0,0,MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|TRADING|ATOM,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-10-11 23:57:30

Prices have been volatile all through 2025 as the old and new projects battle it out. MAGACOIN FINANCE has ascended to unprecedented heights amid the chaos. Investors are looking to get in early as the project‚Äôs community is growing rapidly while the project itself is growing exponentially. Many people see this as an ideal opportunity to enter the market before the next significant upward move and before the project reaches its expected 20,000% ROI. As the market shifts, Ethereum is struggling to hold key levels, whilst Tron remains surprisingly resilient. Ethereum Loses Key Support Ethereum , the world‚Äôs second-largest cryptocurrency, dropped below important price levels this week. Once the price of ETH didn‚Äôt hold above $3900, it started slipping further to the $3800 range. Analysts think the drop happened because the market was liquidated due to BTC‚Äôs correction and issues with the ETF. The drop was also met with declining on-chain activities as gas fees declined significantly due to less congestion. Although Ethereum has some weakness in the short term, the long-term sentiment is bullish. Once macroeconomic stability returns and fresh staking inflows are deep, several traders expect a strong rebound. According to some experts, ETH could rise to $4,500 to $5,000 later this year if ETF approvals arrive and Layer-2 adoption speeds up. Currently, the asset faces resistance zones that may limit its upside until institutional demand reinvigorates. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Hidden Gem of 2025 While the spotlight remains on the larger market players, MAGACOIN FINANCE has quietly become one of the most talked-about projects in the altcoin community. The token has achieved massive growth in a short period, quickly positioning itself as a major contender for the next breakout. MAGACOIN FINANCE has built a foundation of trust and credibility rarely seen among early-stage cryptocurrencies. Its focus on innovation, security, and long-term development continues to attract a wave of new investors eager to get in before listings on major exchanges. Experts predict that once listings go live and trading opens globally, MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver up to 20,000% ROI, placing it among the top-performing assets in the market. The project‚Äôs roadmap emphasizes continuous ecosystem growth, partnerships, and expanding token utility ‚Äì all key factors for sustained momentum. With every new milestone, community interest grows stronger, and analysts now describe MAGACOIN FINANCE as the most promising early-stage crypto project of 2025 , capable of outperforming established names once the market turns bullish again. Tron Defies the Market Trend Tron (TRX) performed well, outpacing other major cryptocurrencies that dropped by double-digit percentages. The stablecoin transactions of the network and the constant growth of its DeFi have helped it remain one of the few cryptoassets with stable prices. TRX has been holding quite well at the $0.31 level. The Tron DAO Reserve is getting stronger while cross-chain activities are getting bigger. This is what powers the momentum. In recent weeks, the transaction volume and total value locked (TVL) of the blockchain are setting new records owing to to the increased user activity. As per analysts, a suitable focus on stability, liquidity and utility-based products could make Tron a safe haven like Bitcoin during crypto market volatility. It has further strengthened its market position through ongoing integrations with a diverse array of payment solutions and blockchain applications. Market Volatility and Investor Strategy Due to current uncertain times, investors have become more selective yet opportunistic. Many traders are using the market correction as an opportunity to reposition their portfolios before the subsequent recovery. The primary large-cap assets in the portfolio, Bitcoin and Ethereum, have proven to be invaluable. However, the focus is on newer emerging altcoins which have the potential of high upside. As we‚Äôve seen in the past, buying into strong projects while price action is down tends to yield incredible gains when the action picks up again. Initiatives like MAGACOIN FINANCE are now recognised as a strategic move for those seeking to achieve exponential growth in the future cycle. The fact that its audited foundation, organic community growth and future listing on exchanges make it this year‚Äôs emerging token. Conclusion As Ethereum struggles to recover and Tron continues to disregard the market trend, the attention is slowly shifting to the new-generation projects with huge growth potential. The volatility that marked 2025 has shown that innovation still manages to stand out and MAGACOIN FINANCE is proving this with its prominence. MAGACOIN FINANCE is expected to give its investors a 20,000% ROI. This is due to its amazing growth, audited verification and robust roadmap prior to global launch. To many, it will be seen as something more than just another altcoin. It‚Äôs a rare opportunity in being involved in one of the next success stories of the cryptocurrency space.

Riley has stated that XRP could soon achieve its most bullish weekly candle on record if the token maintains its current momentum through the end of the week. In an update shared on X, Riley explained that a weekly close at $3.115 would set a new record for XRP, marking the strongest weekly candle since its inception. The projection comes as the broader crypto market attempts to stabilize following a period of sharp volatility and widespread liquidations. Market Turbulence Follows Tariff Announcement The analyst‚Äôs remarks came after a turbulent trading session that saw several major cryptocurrencies plunge in value before making rapid recoveries. The sharp downturn was triggered by U.S. President Donald Trump‚Äôs announcement of a 100% tariff on Chinese imports, a move that reignited fears of a trade conflict between the two largest global economies. If we close over $3.1150 by Sunday, it'll be the most bullish $XRP weekly candle in history. ‚Äî Patrick L Riley (@Acquired_Savant) October 10, 2025 The announcement led to significant sell-offs across traditional and digital financial markets. Within hours, the total global cryptocurrency market capitalization dropped to about $3.7 trillion, while the U.S. stock market reportedly lost $1.65 trillion in value. Data from CoinGlass showed that $19 billion in leveraged positions were liquidated during the crash, marking one of the largest single-day liquidation events in crypto history. XRP Suffers 56% Intraday Drop Before Recovery Amid the turmoil, XRP recorded one of its steepest intraday declines in recent months. On October 10, the token fell from a daily high of $2.84 to a low of $1.25 on Binance, representing a 56% drop within 24 hours. However, the asset quickly regained a large portion of its losses, rebounding to around $2.47 by press time . Despite the sharp volatility, XRP‚Äôs ability to recover nearly 100% from its daily low has been interpreted by some market observers as a sign of underlying strength. Assessing the Possibility of a Historic Weekly Close According to Riley‚Äôs analysis, if XRP closes this week at $3.115, it would mark the most bullish weekly candle in its trading history. The potential milestone is based on the strong recovery from this week‚Äôs low, which represents a 148% rebound from $1.25 to $3.11. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 For comparison, XRP‚Äôs largest weekly gain occurred in December 2017, when the token surged 215%, rising from $0.23 to $0.71. While the current setup may not exceed that performance in terms of total percentage growth, the analyst emphasized that the recovery from extreme lows makes this week particularly significant. XRP began the current week trading at $2.97, meaning a close at $3.11 would represent a more modest 4.86% weekly increase. Nonetheless, the rapid rebound from its intraweek low has strengthened optimism among traders that XRP could be preparing for a more sustained uptrend. XRP Sets New Quarterly Record Beyond its weekly performance, XRP also achieved a historic quarterly close at the end of Q3 2025, finishing the period at $2.846, a 27.16% increase from its Q2 close of $2.23. This figure marks the highest quarterly close ever recorded for XRP. In addition, September 2025 now ranks as the third-highest monthly close in the asset‚Äôs history, behind January 2025 ($3.03) and July 2025 ($3.02). With Q4 2025 now underway , analysts remain optimistic about XRP‚Äôs performance prospects. Historically, the token has recorded its strongest gains during the fourth quarter, with average growth of around 140%. Past examples include a 240% surge in Q4 2024 and a 1,064% increase in Q4 2017, both of which contributed to major bullish cycles in XRP‚Äôs history. While the broader crypto market remains volatile, XRP‚Äôs resilience amid recent turmoil has strengthened investor optimism . Patrick L. Riley‚Äôs analysis underscores the potential for a historic weekly candle if the asset maintains its momentum through the weekend.

53013123,604045,1760229046,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53013123.jpeg,CZ‚Äôs Comeback? Trump Weighs Presidential Pardon For Binance Founder,https://bitcoinist.com/president-trump-potential-pardon-binance-founder-cz/,"US President Donald Trump is reportedly considering a pardon for Binance co-founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao , commonly known as CZ. This development comes amid heavy liquidations in the crypto market after the Republican president also announced plans for a 100% tariff on Chinese goods. Could CZ Be Heading Back To Binance? In a report on October 10, Fox Business reporter Charles Gasparino shared an inside scoop stating that discussions in the White House had commenced over a potential presidential pardon for Binance‚Äôs former boss, CZ. The analyst explains that this motion appeared to have sprung out of a partial belief in Trump‚Äôs camp that the fraud case against the Chinese-born Canadian was ‚Äúweak‚Äù and that his felony conviction and prison sentence were disproportionate.In 2023, US authorities charged Changpeng Zhao and Binance with violating the Bank Secrecy Act and failing to maintain adequate anti‚Äìmoney laundering (AML) controls. According to the US Department of Justice, Binance allowed illicit funds to move through its platform, including transactions linked to sanctioned countries and criminal enterprises such as the Lazarus group of North Korea. CZ personally pleaded guilty to one count of failing to maintain an effective AML program, admitting that he did not implement sufficient safeguards to prevent Binance from being used for unlawful purposes. The plea deal was part of a broader settlement in which Binance agreed to pay over $4.3 billion in penalties, one of the largest corporate fines in US history. As part of the agreement, CZ also stepped down as Binance CEO and was sentenced to four months in federal prison in April 2024. Following his conviction, Zhao temporarily relinquished direct control of Binance but continues to retain his ownership stake. A potential presidential pardon could effectively erase CZ‚Äôs conviction and restore his legal standing. However, likely, the former Binance boss remains away from the formal leadership of the exchange due to Binance‚Äôs agreement with the DOJ under the oversight of a multi-year independent compliance monitor. Presidential Pardon Still Some Time Away Amid the positive news for Zhao, Gasparino has also noted that the presidential pardon may take some time as the US government is facing critical issues, including managing the conflict in the Gaza Strip and Ukraine, while also teasing another tariff battle with China. Notably, Trump has now threatened to impose a 100% tariff on all Chinese goods after the Asian nation announced plans to implement sweeping export controls on almost every product starting from November 1, 2025. In response, the general crypto market is down by 9.63% and is presently valued at around $3.72 trillion. Within this time, Bitcoin, the market leader, has declined by 7.81 with prices now set around $111,900.",Binance|binance|Changpeng Zhao|CZ|Gasparino|President Donald Trump|Presidential Pardon,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|BNB|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-12 00:30:46

As the third-quarter earnings season begins, traders expect Corporate America to prove that the rally is justified. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, analysts are projecting 7.4% profit growth for U.S. companies this quarter, up slightly since mid-August, while the MSCI All-Country World Index is also heading toward an all-time high. The surge, driven by the AI investment boom, has inflated valuations and expectations alike. But that optimism is running into headwinds. The S&P 500 has soared 32% from its April low, yet tensions over tariffs, worries about a tech bubble, and a still-fractured global trade system are weighing on confidence. Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, said: ‚ÄúInvestors will be very unforgiving of any kind of slip, whether it‚Äôs a slip in earnings or a slip of the tongue when talking about expectations.‚Äù The pressure now shifts to the nation‚Äôs biggest players as JPMorgan Chase & Co. and other top banks kick off results next week, followed later by the megacap tech giants whose gains have powered most of this rally. Trump‚Äôs tariffs hammer stock profits ‚Äì Investors demand clarity from companies Trade is once again the story of the season. President Donald Trump announced plans for a new 100% tariff on Chinese goods, plus export controls on ‚Äúany and all critical software,‚Äù to begin November 1. The decision hit markets immediately, with analysts warning that months of elevated tariffs are already cutting into corporate profits. Deutsche Bank AG estimates that S&P 500 earnings growth would have been about one percentage point higher this quarter without those tariffs. Asian exporters, who shipped $1.3 trillion in goods to the U.S. last year, have so far weathered the hikes, though many fund managers think that‚Äôs due to front-loaded exports before tariffs fully take effect. In Europe, earnings expectations are already being trimmed. A Citigroup index shows estimates have been falling steadily since mid-March, lowering the bar for upcoming reports. At the same time, the AI spending boom hasn‚Äôt slowed. UBS forecasts a 67% jump in global capital expenditures this year to $375 billion, with Societe Generale noting that the capex-to-sales ratio is at a 25-year high. But any hint of a slowdown could shake investor confidence. Mike O‚ÄôRourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading, said , ‚ÄúA slowdown would be like slamming on the brakes. A lot of names would enter a real profit-taking mode.‚Äù Layoffs, currency swings, and China‚Äôs weak growth add pressure With the federal government shutdown blocking new employment data, investors are watching earnings calls for signs of workforce cuts. Ross Mayfield, strategist at Robert W. Baird & Co., warned that layoffs could expose deeper weakness in the labor market and weigh on consumer spending. ‚ÄúIf you see enough of those start to stack up,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúit‚Äôs a signal the labor market is weaker than expected.‚Äù Currency trends are also shaping Q3 results. The U.S. dollar rallied against major currencies but remains well below its 2022 peak. That‚Äôs a relief for exporters and multinationals converting foreign income into dollars. Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, said the softer dollar, along with AI-driven capital investment, could add ‚Äúanother 5‚Äì7% upside‚Äù to profit forecasts and lift earnings at a low-teens pace this quarter. In Europe, the stronger euro remains a drag. Susana Cruz, strategist at Panmure Liberum, said the recent dip came too late to benefit Q3 reports, especially for construction, healthcare, and technology firms that generate nearly 60% of sales abroad. Meanwhile, China‚Äôs CSI 300 index is up 17% this year, but its Q3 profit outlook is flat, with just 3% growth expected. The upcoming meeting between Trump and Xi Jinping is now uncertain, as both countries tighten restrictions on tech and material flows. Still, there‚Äôs a glimmer of improvement. Goldman Sachs believes China‚Äôs corporate downgrades are slowing as factory activity and industrial profits rebound. Some analysts also pointed to Beijing‚Äôs efforts to tackle involution, the destructive domestic price wars that have plagued competition. Get seen where it counts.

The Oracle of Omaha‚Äôs long game with Japan‚Äôs five powerful trading companies (Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Itochu, Marubeni, Sumitomo) has turned into one of his largest foreign equity plays, as the total value of those stock holdings has rallied by 392% since he first went public with them in Q3 of 2020 on Warren‚Äôs 90th birthday. Back then, Berkshire‚Äôs positions were worth around $6.3 billion. Today, they sit at roughly $31 billion, thanks to both continued buying and stock gains ranging between 227% and 551%. Berkshire had been quietly building these stakes for a year before Warren made them public. At first, he said Berkshire held about 5% in each of the five companies. But recent filings show that two of those holdings have now gone above 10%, suggesting he has continued to buy despite earlier promises to stay below that level. Some of the additional purchases may not even have been disclosed yet, meaning Berkshire‚Äôs real exposure to Japan could be higher than what‚Äôs known. Berkshire boosts its stakes in Mitsui and Mitsubishi This week, Mitsui & Co. confirmed in a statement that Berkshire‚Äôs insurance arm, National Indemnity, owned 292,044,900 shares as of September 30, equal to about 10.1% of the company. At Friday‚Äôs close, those shares were worth nearly $7.1 billion, making Berkshire Mitsui‚Äôs largest shareholder. The number is up from 285,401,400 shares, or a 9.7% stake, reported back in March. Mitsui said Berkshire had earlier informed it that voting rights had exceeded 10%, but this filing was the first to reveal the exact amount. Two weeks earlier, Mitsubishi also confirmed that Berkshire‚Äôs holding had climbed to 10.2%, up from 9.7% in March. The three other companies (Itochu, Marubeni, and Sumitomo) haven‚Äôt issued updates since spring, but market analysts expect those stakes could also have quietly increased. Warren had initially agreed not to raise Berkshire‚Äôs ownership above 10% without approval from each firm. But in his February 2024 annual letter to shareholders, he wrote, ‚ÄúAs we approached this limit, the five companies agreed to moderately relax the ceiling.‚Äù He added, ‚ÄúOver time, you will likely see Berkshire‚Äôs ownership of all five increase somewhat .‚Äù That opened the door for him to expand beyond the original cap. Occidental struggles while Berkshire‚Äôs Japan bet soars Warren said in 2023 that he bought into these Japanese firms in 2020 because ‚Äúthey were selling at what I thought was a ridiculous price, particularly the price compared to the interest rates prevailing at that time.‚Äù He later told shareholders Berkshire plans to keep them for ‚Äú50 years or forever .‚Äù But while Berkshire‚Äôs Japan holdings have performed, its Occidental Petroleum investment hasn‚Äôt.Warren began buying Occidental shares in 2022, building a 26% stake now worth around $12 billion. The company‚Äôs CEO, Vicki Hollub, 65, has led the firm since April 2016, but the stock has fallen from $76 to $45, producing a negative 20% total return, including dividends. Over the same period, the Energy Select Sector SPDR, led by Exxon Mobil and Chevron, has gained over 90%, while competitors like Diamondback Energy and EOG Resources have doubled. At Berkshire‚Äôs 2023 annual meeting, Warren called Hollub an ‚Äúextraordinary manager.‚Äù Still, Barron‚Äôs estimates Berkshire‚Äôs average cost per Occidental share in the low $50s , leaving him in the red. He‚Äôs long preached about keeping strong balance sheets at both Berkshire and its investments (like Apple, Coca-Cola, and American Express) but with Occidental, he broke that rule. And now, he‚Äôs paying the price. So are Occidental‚Äôs other shareholders.

With the community still grappling with the news, investors are holding out for a pump from the newly found confidence, but some are doubtful. Meanwhile, another opportunity, Mutuum Finance, is simmering in the background for those who are looking for something other than meme coins. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is available for just $0.035, has raised a staggering $17.1 million from a record 16,840+ investors in its presale. And whereas SHIB is constructed on hype, Mutuum Finance offers actual DeFi utility coupled with phenomenal growth potential. Shibarium‚Äôs $4 Million Refund Ignites Speculation of SHIB Comeback While Shibarium rolls out a $4 million refund program following a record exploit and network shutdown, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) community waits with bated breath for a turn. The speed of the relief efforts of the network, from rotating all validator keys to locking up over 100 contracts and reclaiming 4.6 million BONE tokens, reflect the good faith effort to revive investor confidence, as the SHIB price continues to remain within the contracting triangle pattern, which is good news for a future breakout. Technical indicators show bearish momentum as constructers rebuild security, building upon this muted token that has investors on tenterhooks anticipating the relaunch of Ethereum bridge and compensation paid to victims. With this determined rebound period, focus is inevitably defaulted to break-out plays that bridge power with systematic growth, an area that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is increasingly making inroads into. Mutuum Finance Presale Momentum Grows Fast Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in the investor limelight following immense momentum on Phase 6 of its presale. Tokens are now selling at $0.035, an increase by a 16.17% hike from the previous round. More than 16,840 investors have already bought , generating more than $17.1 million, a healthy sign of greater market confidence in Mutuum Finance‚Äôs long-term DeFi future. With more than 60% subscribed in Phase 6 well, early investors are buying ahead of the next price increase. A reserve multiplier structure, distributed across 10% for low-risk projects and 35% for high-risk projects, acts as a second cushion. The structure facilitates system robustness, minimizes liquidation shocks, and guards capital integrity. Collateral management is being optimized too, for maximum borrowing power through mutually reinforcing leveraging of related assets, with minimal risk of bankruptcy and platform overall health. Real-Time Data Integrity with Chainlink Oracles For stable, accurate pricing and risk calculation, Mutuum Finance utilizes Chainlink oracles for USD, ETH, MATIC, and AVAX feeds. Fallback oracles, intricate data sources, and decentralized exchange TWAPs ensure the protocol valuation is accurate even in record-record volatility or low liquidity situations. Mutuum Finance will be launching its next-gen lending and borrowing protocol , a crucial milestone on its roadmap. Version 1 (V1) is expected to launch on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 and will feature essential elements like liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and a liquidator bot. ETH and USDT will be present at launch for collateralization, lending, and borrowing and make users enjoy a secure, efficient, and scalable DeFi. The system further accommodates floating and fixed-rate instruments and matches supply and demand for liquidity as well as keeps the ecosystem in balance. While Shibarium compensates $4 million after its recent attack, Shiba Inu (SHIB) investors wait for a turnaround, but the majority of them are already eyeing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) since it has better potential for upside. At $0.035 under Phase 6 of its presale, MUTM has gained over $17.1 million in capital from 16,840+ investors, selling over 60% of tokens. Whereas meme-tokens do not have genuine DeFi utility in the form of lending and borrowing protocol, Chainlink-driven pricing, and reserve multipliers of up to 35% for extra security, Mutuum is establishing itself as a secure, scalable solution for long-term investors. As SHIB is picking up steam, Mutuum Finance is one of the top cryptos to bet on this month before presale develops into its subsequent stage.

XRP and Cardano (ADA) both fell significantly over the past day, which rekindled the capital rotation talk among traders. With the price decrease, investors seek stable opportunities, so MAGACOIN FINANCE can be considered one of the best altcoins to buy this week. Moreover, the rising rotation movement has been characterized by decreased reliance on the old tokens such as XRP, ADA and DOGE to new presales with better returns. According to analysts, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the best altcoin to buy now as investor demand continues to surge. XRP Price Slides Double Digits, What‚Äôs Next? Over the past 24 hours, XRP has experienced a steep drop of 11%, falling from $2.82 to $2.50. The selloff wiped off billions of its market cap, which is currently standing at around $149.8 billion. Although the market declined, the volume of trade increased by over 315% which is an indication of high activity from panic sellers and opportunistic buyers. XRPUSD 1-Day Chart | Source: CMC The chart depicts that XRP is recovering marginally on intraday lows around $2.00 and stabilizing at around $2.50. Nonetheless, the recovery has been weak with sellers still limiting any rise above $2.60. The structure is a sign of a market that is struggling to recover, consisting of lower highs with every attempt to rally. According to the technical indicators, XRP is consolidating between $2.40 and $2.60, a range that is likely to determine the direction in the short term. The persistence of price action above $2.40 may result in an accumulation stage, which would allow potential recovery to $2.80. However, when the token falls below $2.30, a retest of the $2.00 support can occur. Even though it has weakened in the short term, the fundamentals of XRP, especially in the cross-border payment solutions, are still strong in supporting the long-term narrative. Cardano Whales Rotate to This Top Altcoin Cardano (ADA) also endured heavy losses, falling 17% to trade around $0.68. The decline followed a major breakdown below the $0.80 support, leading to cascading liquidations and a 417% surge in trading volume to $5.57 billion. This intense market activity indicates that whales and leveraged traders are actively repositioning portfolios. ADAUSD 1-Day Chart | Source: CMC The token briefly rebounded from lows near $0.50, showing that buyers are defending key liquidity zones. Still, ADA faces strong resistance between $0.70 and $0.72, levels that were once solid supports. Its current volatility mirrors the broader crypto market‚Äôs risk-off sentiment following Bitcoin‚Äôs correction. However, on-chain data shows long-term investors maintaining positions as they seek new entry points. Many are rotating capital into high-potential presales , with MAGACOIN FINANCE emerging as a favored target. Its growing presale traction and strong analyst endorsements have attracted attention from former ADA holders looking for the next growth story. With $15 million already raised, MAGACOIN FINANCE is now viewed as the best altcoin to buy during this market dip. Dogecoin Price Prediction Dogecoin (DOGE) suffered one of the largest declines among top-10 assets, falling over 21% to trade near $0.195. The drop came after a short-lived consolidation around $0.25, triggering widespread liquidations and stop-loss cascades. Market capitalization dropped to $29.55 billion as traders rushed to exit positions. DOGEUSD 1-Day Chart | Source: CMC The chart indicates a flash crash that momentarily drove the prices below $0.15 and then a slight recovery. This volatility suggests both fear-led exits and speculative buyers entering the opportunity. The volume of trading in DOGE increased by 292 percent, which supports the story of panic selling alongside tactical buying. Analysts find the $0.19 mark as vital short-term support, and the resistance is around $0.22 and 0.25. Unless DOGE can regain these areas, then there is the risk that it will move towards $0.16 again. To long-term investors this consolidation can be a possible entry point in case of improvement of the broader sentiment. Nevertheless, capital is moving away from meme tokens such as DOGE and towards newer presale tokens with actual growth traction, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is first in the pack. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is the Best Altcoin to Bet On MAGACOIN FINANCE presale has been a topic that has attracted a lot of attention in the crypto market and has already raised over $15 million . Analysts have multiple reasons why it is popular: Ethereum-based reliability, transparent presale stages and a rapidly expanding investor base. These are the early signs of other successful breakout projects such as Shiba Inu and PEPE before their viral booms. The excitement among investors is still growing with every step of the pre-sale increasing the price of the token, which motivates early participation. Analysts forecast that by the end of 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE will give 100x returns and bearish projections target $1.00 per token after exchange listings. With XRP, ADA, and DOGE under market volatility, capital rotation is proceeding to presales with more fundamental and defined upside potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE is the best altcoin to buy now due to the growing investor demand. Conclusion The sharp correction of the crypto market has provided fresh opportunities to investors looking for early-stage growth. As XRP, Cardano and Dogecoin are struggling to recover from the loss, the presale momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE is taking another turn. Having already raised more than $15 million and being ranked as one of the best altcoins to buy in 2025 by analysts, it has become the obvious target of those investors who focus beyond short-term volatility.

He noted that a move above $4,000 would be a crucial development, potentially marking a key turning point for Ethereum‚Äôs momentum. Bearish Daily Close Mirrors Bitcoin‚Äôs Market Direction CRYPTOWZRD further explained that Ethereum and ETH/BTC‚Äôs daily candle bearish close followed Bitcoin‚Äôs lead. Despite the negative close, Ethereum displayed relative strength compared to most other cryptocurrencies, maintaining a more resilient structure amid the decline. This reflects the asset‚Äôs continued dominance in the altcoin market. Related Reading: Ethereum Turns Bullish After Multi-Year Breakout ‚Äî $7,000 May Be Imminent He noted that ETH/BTC has now reached its key support target zone. The market‚Äôs behavior around this level will be crucial in determining whether Ethereum is preparing for a rebound or remains at risk of deeper consolidation. A recovery toward $4,170 remains possible if Ethereum can hold this support region and sustain its current stability. The analyst highlighted that a move back above $4,000 would serve as an encouraging signal, validating a successful retest of the lower support area. Such a move could reignite bullish sentiment and set the stage for renewed upside momentum in the short to mid-term. However, CRYPTOWZRD cautioned that Bitcoin‚Äôs price movement will continue to dictate the broader market trend. Heading into the weekend, the analyst acknowledged that the market remains unpredictable, with both bullish and bearish scenarios still in play. His current focus, he stated, will remain on monitoring lower time frame chart formations to identify potential scalp opportunities. Extreme Volatility Hits As Market Faces Major Liquidation Event In his conclusion, CRYPTOWZRD noted that the intraday chart for Ethereum showed extreme volatility as the market experienced one of the most intense liquidation events in its history. Despite the turbulence, he emphasized that reclaiming the $4,000 level places Ethereum back in positive territory. Related Reading: Ethereum Faces TD Sell Signal At Key Resistance‚Äî$4,100 Next? He explained that a retest of the $4,260 intraday resistance could serve as a key turning point in the short term. This zone will be crucial in determining whether Ethereum can sustain its recovery or faces renewed downward pressure. If price action shows weakness after testing this level, it may open the door for short opportunities as momentum begins to fade. CRYPTOWZRD added that he remains open to both bullish and bearish scenarios, acknowledging that weekend trading often brings slower volatility and unpredictable market behavior. With that in mind, he stated that he will continue to monitor price movements, waiting for the next clear trade setup to emerge before making any decisive moves.

New models like the Sorento crossover, K4 sedan, and, of course, the ubiquitous Telluride three-row SUV are everywhere, it seems. And then there are the electric EV6 and EV9. Those vehicles led Kia to smash sales expectations again, with September US sales hitting a record 65,000 units sold, an 11% jump from a year ago, with full third quarter sales climbing 9% to another record high. Year‚Äëto‚Äëdate sales are now 8.9% higher, according to Eric‚ÄØWatson, KIA‚ÄØAmerica‚Äôs vice president of sales. ‚ÄúWe had a great September, and you know, it‚Äôs really been every month of this year, our sales are building,‚Äù Eric said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre up almost‚ÄØ9%‚ÄØyear‚Äëto‚Äëdate, so we continue to build strength every single month.‚Äù The momentum comes from a wave of fresh models that have flooded U.S. dealerships. The Sorento crossover, K4 sedan, and Telluride SUV have all become regular sights in suburban driveways, while the electric EV6 and EV9 have captured buyers chasing battery‚Äëpowered options without Tesla price tags. Those five models alone have pushed the brand to new territory, keeping production lines running close to full tilt. KIA expands U.S. footprint as Telluride and EVs dominate KIA, which is actually South‚ÄØKorea‚Äôs second‚Äëlargest automaker behind Hyundai, entered the U.S. market in‚ÄØ1993‚ÄØwith the Sephia and Sportage. Both sold slowly, as Americans saw the brand as a budget option. That changed when KIA introduced a‚ÄØ10‚Äëyear‚ÄØor‚ÄØ100,000‚Äëmile powertrain warranty, a move that shocked the industry and helped calm skeptical buyers. Steady gains followed, leading to the opening of its first U.S. assembly plant in‚ÄØWest‚ÄØPoint,‚ÄØGeorgia‚ÄØin‚ÄØ2009. Back then, the company leaned into humor with oddball ads like the 2010‚ÄØ‚ÄúBlack‚ÄØSheep‚Äù rapping hamsters promoting the Kia‚ÄØSoul, carving out a niche audience. But 2017‚ÄØmarked a turning point when the high‚Äëperformance Stinger‚ÄØGT arrived. The car earned strong reviews from ‚Äú2‚ÄØDudes‚ÄØin‚ÄØa‚ÄØCar‚Äù hosts Rick‚ÄØNewman and Eric‚ÄØWatson, signaling a new level of seriousness for the automaker. The real game‚Äëchanger, though, was the Telluride, which Eric said was ‚Äúa huge piece of redefining who we were as a brand.‚Äù The Telluride‚Äôs three‚Äërow layout, comfortable cabin, and sub‚Äë$37,000‚ÄØstarting price helped it dominate middle‚Äë and upper‚Äëmiddle‚Äëclass neighborhoods nationwide. ‚ÄúYou start to see Telluride as one of the two vehicles in their driveway,‚Äù Eric said. ‚ÄúIf they bought a‚ÄØTelluride, perhaps the next car they replace also becomes a‚ÄØKIA.‚Äù Around‚ÄØ2021, KIA overhauled its logo and revamped dealerships, with 60%‚ÄØof U.S. outlets rebuilt or expanded to handle rising demand. That same wave carried the EV9, a‚ÄØlarge electric SUV styled like a‚ÄØRange‚ÄØRover, into strong early sales and another positive ‚Äú2‚ÄØDudes‚Äù review. KIA faces labor raids, theft lawsuits, and new production goals While KIA‚Äôs U.S. push keeps accelerating, it hasn‚Äôt avoided controversy. On‚ÄØSeptember‚ÄØ9, a‚ÄØfederal raid at the Hyundai‚ÄëLG battery complex in‚ÄØEllabell,‚ÄØGeorgia‚ÄØled to‚ÄØ300‚ÄØSouth‚ÄØKorean workers being detained for immigration violations, just two‚ÄØdays after President‚ÄØDonald‚ÄØTrump warned foreign firms to obey American labor laws. The raid delayed the plant‚Äôs opening and briefly threatened relations between the administration and Korean automakers. KIA has built most of its U.S. facilities in non‚Äëunion states, keeping costs lower and sticker prices competitive. The Trump White‚ÄØHouse, known for backing domestic factory jobs but not unions, has tolerated the approach despite the headlines. Another major headache was the ‚ÄúKIA‚ÄØChallenge,‚Äù viral TikTok trend showing how to steal older KIA and‚ÄØHyundai‚ÄØmodels that lacked electronic immobilizers. Thefts exploded until a‚ÄØsoftware fix rolled out nationwide. Even so, the company paid a‚ÄØ$200‚ÄØmillion‚ÄØsettlement after owners sued. Eric says U.S. plants can now produce electric, hybrid, and gas models on the same lines to meet shifting demand. New models are coming, including an updated Telluride that, in his words, will take the brand to ‚Äúnew heights.‚Äù Globally, KIA projects 3.22‚ÄØmillion‚ÄØvehicle shipments this year, up‚ÄØ4.1%, with revenue expected to rise‚ÄØ4.7%. In the U.S., it plans to increase market share from‚ÄØ5.1%‚ÄØto over‚ÄØ6%‚ÄØand increase sales‚ÄØ7%‚ÄØyear‚Äëover‚Äëyear. A‚ÄØnew electric pickup is also coming to North‚ÄØAmerica, expected to sell‚ÄØ90,000‚ÄØunits‚ÄØa‚ÄØyear once production stabilizes.

As the network continues to attract the brightest minds in crypto, Umbra and Arcium have emerged as two of its strongest catalysts. Both projects have captured the essence of SOL‚Äôs revival execution at scale. How Two Projects Are Redefining Solana Core The Solana ecosystem just witnessed history in motion. In an x post , the founder of Sensei Holdings and Namaste Group, Solana Sensei, gave a massive shoutout to Umbra and Arcium, calling them legends for making history on SOL. It‚Äôs a moment that captures the pulse of the ecosystem as builders are winning. Umbra is one of the largest launches in SOL‚Äôs history, and it‚Äôs all centered around built-in privacy, a native feature the SOL network truly needs. The project raised an astonishing $155 million in its public sale, with more than 200x oversubscription. Those numbers reflect trust in a team and a vision that is deeply aligned with SOL‚Äôs next chapter. However, Umbra is a privacy protocol built natively for SOL, designed to bring confidentiality, composability, and compliance-ready infrastructure into the SOL ecosystem , which is known for speed and scale. Sensei mentioned that he is not surprised by the success, considering the talent and vision behind the teams are Umbra, Arcium, and the MetaDAO, a collective of builders shaping the next frontier of decentralized infrastructure. A prominent crypto analyst and market commentator, Tom Tucker, has highlighted a growing trend that signals rising institutional conviction in Solana, as big players are loading up on SOL. Companies such as Forward Industries and DeFi Development Corp are now actively building SOL treasuries, together holding over 2.4% of the total supply , worth an estimated $3 billion. This kind of accumulation is about commitment. By locking up billions in SOL, these companies are signaling confidence in SOL‚Äôs long-term future. SOL Prepares For Its Next Big Move MANDO CT, a recognized figure in the crypto community, has pointed out that the Solana range breakout is loading. For months, SOL has been quietly building a base between $160 support and range resistance , setting the stage for a major range breakout. Every dip has been absorbed, which is a classic accumulation pattern. Currently, the range is tightening, as price is pressing against the ceiling, and volume is starting to expand, signaling that energy is building for a potential breakout. With liquidity just above, a clean breakout here might set off a powerful continuation wave. Also, MANDO noted that he was buying 20,000 SOL at $11, when smart money was accumulating while most looked away. If SOL clears this range with conviction, and $250+ comes into play fast, retail will buy the setup.",Solana|Arcium|Defi Development Corp|Forward Industries|MANDO CT|MetaDAO|Namaste Group|Sensei Holdings|SOL|SOL news|SOL price|solana|Solana ecosystem|Solana news|Solana price|Solana Sensei|solusd|SOLUSDT|Tom Tucker|Umbra,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SOL|ZRX|BLOCKCHAIN|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-12 02:00:19

Analysts are pointing to the end of the U.S. government shutdown as the key catalyst to spark the next bull run and enable approval of long-awaited altcoin ETFs that could see massive inflows of capital. The market has been awaiting news following regulatory agencies‚Äô pause on new ETF applications during the shutdown. With operations back up and running, experts say that multiple crypto-based ETFs are poised to go green, likely sparking a wave of institutional buying. MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the projects poised to benefit increasingly. The community of the token is growing fast. Analysts believe that, at the current growth pace, it could end 2025 as one of the top cryptocurrencies. ETF Approvals Could Change Everything Analysts who keep an eye on the market agree that announcements of ETF approvals do high-impact events that create overnight shifts in sentiment. The last Bitcoin ETF wave took the entire market to new highs, and a repeat reaction will happen once Ethereum, XRP and Solana ETFs come to the scene. There has been substantial institutional interest in digital assets but most traditional investors are hoping for regulated, exchange-traded products to reduce low entry barriers. After the approval of these ETFs, billions in new inflows could come into play creating positive momentum for leading altcoins. Analysts suggest the next leg of the bull market could start much sooner than expected, provided these approvals come along with reopened U.S. government operations and renewed risk appetite. XRP: Institutional Money Could Flow In XRP has been under the radar during 2025, mainly after the company behind it expanded its partnerships in the Middle East and Asia. An XRP ETF would mark a significant change to the crypto space and offer institutional investors direct access to one of the fastest payment assets. Many traders expect XRP to retest $3.50 either way before the year‚Äôs end as the price consolidates around $2.3. XRP is a strong contender for mainstream adoption since it can quickly become the most popular cryptocurrency as institutional channels open. Solana: ETF Speculation Reignites Investor Hype Solana is one of Ethereum‚Äôs biggest competitors and has garnered significant praise. If the Solana ETF gets the green light, it could pave the way for big institutional access to one of the world‚Äôs fastest-growing blockchain ecosystems. Even after several pullbacks, SOL has managed to hold its ground around the $200 price mark. Solana is becoming very common in DeFi, NFTs, and real-world tokenisation. Its ecosystem continues to attract developers and capital. Experts believe Solana‚Äôs price could reach new highs with ETF approval, potentially surpassing its previous high and breaking the $300 mark. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Rising Power in the Altcoin Market While established giants like XRP and Solana dominate headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly outperforming expectations. Following successful CertiK and HashEx audits, the project has built a foundation of trust and momentum that few early-stage tokens achieve. Its growing community is one of the most active in the market, with new investors joining daily and early participants already seeing substantial returns. Analysts are calling it one of the most promising altcoins for long-term growth, with potential returns of up to 50x as the market cycle matures. MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äôs strength lies in its combination of transparency, innovation, and a clear ecosystem strategy. As institutional capital prepares to flow into the altcoin sector, MAGACOIN FINANCE could become one of the biggest beneficiaries ‚Äì transforming from an early-stage success into a market leader by 2025. Cardano: Building for the Future One of the most technologically advanced blockchains in the space, Cardano has a vision of long-term scalability and sustainability. The fundamentals of ADA are getting stronger than ever as Voltaire governance phase improvements continue with Hydra development continuing. Analysts believe that as the DeFi ecosystem of Cardano continues to expand, there could be a price target of around $5 in the next bull leg. If institutional products start including ADA, it could see another wave of inflows, becoming a key asset in diversified crypto offerings. Litecoin: The Veteran Makes a Comeback Litecoin is often referred to as the ‚Äúdigital silver‚Äù to Bitcoin. It is a reliable coin with a simple framework. As it is not marketed as a newer project but as it has been transacted and supported by many exchanges, it performs well in every bull market. LTC reduced the block reward after the halving event, renewing the belief. This could lead to price acceleration once the altcoin season picks up again. According to some analysts, Litecoin may hit $350‚Äì$400 if the excitement surrounding ETFs spreads to the entire crypto space. Conclusion With the US government shutdown behind us and ETF approvals proceeding, the crypto market is preparing for the next bull run. XRP and Solana will be the focus as institutional capital set aside for crypto may soon make its way into the sector. Of all of them, MAGACOIN FINANCE looks to be the most intriguing. Having impressive community growth, full audits and accelerating development, it could become the biggest winner of 2025, delivering market legend returns. The bull market may have taken a brief respite, but the next breakout could catch many investors off guard once these catalysts align.

ChatGPT Issues Crucial Warning,https://cryptopotato.com/will-pi-networks-price-dump-to-another-low-next-week-chatgpt-issues-crucial-warning/,"It‚Äôs safe to say that Pi Network‚Äôs native token has not enjoyed its first several months after the long-awaited official launch in late February 2025. After a spectacular rally to a new all-time high of almost $3.00, the asset has been in a free-fall state ever since, with a few brief and negligible deviations. It continues to dig new lows, and the latest came during the market-wide crash on Friday when it dropped to a fresh ATL of $0.172, according to CoinGecko. This means that it has dumped by over 93% since its aforementioned peak. What‚Äôs Ahead for PI? While the macro trend is more than obvious for PI, let‚Äôs try to highlight a few positives for the bulls and see what ChatGPT believes will be next for its price performance. For instance, a development that could be regarded as bullish, or at least not as bearish as it used to be, is the declining number of tokens set to be released in the following month. As reported on Friday, PiScan data shows a substantial slowdown in this metric, which could ease the immediate selling pressure. Nevertheless, ChatGPT isn‚Äôt too optimistic about PI‚Äôs future price performance. It noted that the overall market sentiment around Pi Network‚Äôs token remains ‚Äúmostly bearish‚Äù as the community enthusiasm fades following months of limited ecosystem growth. The trend was categorized as ‚Äúdeeply bearish‚Äù with no strong support levels left, and every bounce is met with selling. The AI solution indicated that the probability of a bearish continuation exceeds 60%, while the chances for a temporary rebound are somewhere around 25%-30% in the following week. A more profound price stabilization is unlikely to happen soon, and ChatGPT set the odds at 10% to 15% max. But What If‚Ä¶? While the overall odds, landscape, and ChatGPT‚Äôs projections are quite worrisome for Pi Network investors, there‚Äôs always the chance of a surprise in the financial markets. After all, Warren Buffett once said that you should be greedy when others are fearful, as the markets typically move in the opposite direction of what people expect. For such a price reversal to occur in Pi Network‚Äôs native token, a catalyst is necessary. ChatGPT believes that this could come from hype around the Hackathon, which is scheduled to conclude in the following week, or that any of the recently implemented updates can finally catch up and propel a price surge for Pi.

The privacy-focused cryptocurrency surged above $260, marking an 11.84% daily jump and an impressive 94% weekly gain, pushing its market capitalization to over $4.2 billion. While the rest of the market consolidates, investor attention is shifting toward projects showing resilience and growth potential. Among them, MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to attract a steady inflow of fresh capital, reinforcing its position as one of the best-performing altcoins of 2025. Its growing momentum and fully audited ecosystem have made it a top pick for investors seeking strong opportunities in a cautious market. Zcash Leads the Market Recovery Zcash‚Äôs impressive surge highlights renewed interest in privacy-focused cryptocurrencies. Over the past week, ZEC has outperformed nearly every other major altcoin, climbing nearly 100% as trading volume skyrocketed. The spike comes amid increasing discussions about data privacy, decentralized security, and blockchain anonymity. Analysts suggest that Zcash‚Äôs fundamentals are finally being recognized after months of underperformance. The asset‚Äôs latest rally has also helped it reclaim the #28 spot among top cryptocurrencies, signaling a shift in sentiment as traders seek undervalued projects with long-term potential. Many investors see ZEC‚Äôs move as a sign that capital may be rotating into strong-layered projects with real utility rather than pure speculation. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Investor Confidence Builds Before Major Listings While Zcash and Cardano lead their respective categories, MAGACOIN FINANCE has quietly emerged as the next big story in the altcoin market. Backed by full CertiK and HashEx audits, the project has earned investor trust with its transparency and rapid ecosystem growth. Despite the broader market slowdown, MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to attract fresh capital from new investors, with participation rates increasing week after week. Analysts now regard it as one of the most well-performing altcoins of 2025, driven by strong fundamentals and rising community engagement. The project‚Äôs roadmap emphasizes scalability, real-world utility, and long-term sustainability ‚Äì key factors that separate it from short-lived hype tokens. With major exchange listings expected soon, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be gearing up for a massive rally that some predict could exceed 20,000% ROI. Its growing traction has drawn comparisons to early-stage SHIBA INU and DOGECOIN, which saw similar community growth before explosive price action. As liquidity gradually returns to the market, many believe MAGACOIN FINANCE will be among the first altcoins to lead the next wave of gains. Cardano Eyes a Break Above $1 Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA) continues to consolidate near $0.63, holding steady despite broader market uncertainty. For weeks, ADA has faced a major resistance level at $1, failing to break through despite multiple attempts. However, technical analysts believe that a breakout could be imminent. With renewed development activity on the Cardano network and growing ecosystem engagement, the next leg higher may push ADA beyond the psychological $1 threshold. The Hydra scaling upgrade and ongoing governance improvements under the Voltaire phase are expected to drive long-term adoption. Once Bitcoin regains momentum, ADA is expected to follow closely ‚Äì potentially retesting its 2021 highs in the upcoming rally. Cardano‚Äôs combination of stability, scalability, and a loyal community continues to make it one of the safest large-cap plays heading into the final quarter of 2025. Market Stabilizes, but Altcoin Optimism Grows Following one of the most volatile weeks of the year, the overall crypto market is beginning to show signs of stabilization. Bitcoin‚Äôs rebound above $111,000 and Ethereum‚Äôs attempt to reclaim $4,000 have restored some investor confidence. While traders remain cautious, data indicates that the worst of the liquidation pressure has passed, allowing capital to re-enter the market selectively. Historically, such periods of sideways consolidation often precede large-scale altcoin rallies as liquidity redistributes. Zcash‚Äôs sudden rise could be an early sign that capital is shifting toward mid-cap projects with strong fundamentals. Meanwhile, tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE and Cardano are benefiting from increasing investor interest, suggesting a broader altcoin recovery may be closer than many expect. Conclusion Zcash‚Äôs breakout above $260 shows that confidence is returning to the altcoin market, even as Bitcoin consolidates. Cardano remains one of the top candidates for a major move once $1 resistance breaks ‚Äì but it‚Äôs MAGACOIN FINANCE that‚Äôs generating the most excitement among forward-looking investors. With full audits, rapid ecosystem expansion, and increasing investor demand, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a top contender to lead the next bull cycle. If current momentum continues, it may soon become one of 2025‚Äôs defining success stories ‚Äì and possibly one of the highest-returning assets of the year.

By 2028, FLOW could reach a maximum price of $1.77. In 2031, FLOW will range between $3.39 to $4.14. Flow coin, the native token of the Flow blockchain created by Dapper Labs, is essential for powering decentralized applications (dApps) and digital assets. Flow aims to provide a high-performance, user-friendly platform that tackles scalability without sacrificing decentralization. Its unique architecture allows developers to build secure and efficient smart contracts. FLOW, its native token, has several key uses within the ecosystem, including paying transaction fees, staking, and participating in network governance. The growing number of dApps and users on the platform drives demand for Flow coin, influencing FLOW‚Äôs price movements. Given Flow coin‚Äôs strong fundamentals and growing support levels in the ecosystem, the question arises: how high can FLOW go? What will FLOW price be in 2025? Overview Cryptocurrency Flow Token FLOW Price $0.2746 Market Cap $440.57M Trading Volume $9.95M Circulating Supply 1.614B FLOW All-time High $46.16 All-time Low $0.2916 24-hour High $0.2828 24-hour Low $0.2625 Flow coin technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 8.29% 50-Day SMA $0.3844 14-Day RSI 29.72 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 27 (Fear) Green Days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $0.3927 Flow coin (FLOW) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown Flow shows minor recovery around $0.27 but stays bearish overall. The RSI is oversold, suggesting a small bounce is possible soon. Flow coin 1-day price analysis Flow is trading at $0.275, up 1.85% on October 12 after the massive plunge earlier in the week. The price is still below the mid-Bollinger band at $0.348, indicating it remains in a bearish zone despite a minor relief move. The Bollinger bands are widening, confirming strong volatility and continuation of bearish momentum. The MACD stays deep in the negative region with no crossover signal, showing that bearish pressure is still dominant. FLOWUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView While today‚Äôs green candle signals some short-term relief, volume remains low at 3.2M compared to the selling spikes earlier, suggesting this is more of a pause than a true reversal. If Flow manages to close above $0.285‚Äì$0.290, a small relief rally could lift price toward $0.31‚Äì$0.32, but failure to hold $0.27 risks another drop toward $0.25 and possibly $0.22. Flow coin 4-hour price analysis On the 4-hour chart, Flow is consolidating between $0.266 and $0.281, forming a narrow range following its steep decline. The Alligator lines are still negatively aligned, showing a bearish structure, but they are beginning to flatten slightly‚Äîsuggesting selling intensity is easing. RSI sits at 29.7, confirming deep oversold conditions and hinting at a potential short-term bounce if buying picks up. FLOWUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView However, the lack of strong volume or MACD crossover keeps recovery prospects uncertain. A sustained move above $0.285 would signal an intraday rebound, while rejection below $0.27 could renew downward pressure toward $0.25 or even $0.23. FLOW technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.3459 SELL SMA 5 $0.3495 SELL SMA 10 $0.3617 SELL SMA 21 $0.3575 SELL SMA 50 $0.3844 SELL SMA 100 $0.3844 SELL SMA 200 $0.3927 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.3683 SELL EMA 5 $0.3786 SELL EMA 10 $0.3876 SELL EMA 21 $0.3895 SELL EMA 50 $0.3861 SELL EMA 100 $0.3886 SELL EMA 200 $0.4264 SELL What to expect from Flow? Flow has entered a consolidation phase after sharp losses, with bears still controlling the larger trend. The oversold RSI points to a possible short-term bounce, but without a clear MACD reversal or strong volume, recovery remains weak. A close above $0.29 would indicate improving sentiment, while failure to hold $0.27 open the door for another leg down toward $0.25. Is FLOW a good investment? Flow coin has potential as an investment due to its strong partnerships with major brands and its focus on powering decentralized applications, especially in the NFT and gaming spaces. However, like all cryptocurrencies, it carries significant volatility and risks, so investors should carefully consider market conditions and risk tolerance before investing. Will FLOW reach $1? The $1 price mark is within range, having reached that level in early December 2024. Renewed buyer interest could push FLOW to $1 and above in the coming months. Will FLOW reach $5? This level has not been achieved since February 2022. For FLOW to recapture the $5 levels, significant cash inflows will be required. Can FLOW reach $50? FLOW has previously reached an all-time high (ATH) of $46.16, so reaching $50 is achievable. However, a significant bull run and tangible ecosystem updates are required to achieve this feat, as the coin is currently 98% below its ATH. Is Flow a good blockchain? Flow is a solid blockchain, especially for gaming and NFTs. It is designed for scalability, fast transactions, and low fees. The network‚Äôs unique multi-role architecture improves efficiency without compromising decentralization. However, it faces fierce competition, and adoption levels are not as high as those of Ethereum and Solana. Does FLOW have a good long-term future? Projections suggest substantial growth over the coming years, with a potential peak of $3-$4 by 2031. This positive outlook reflects a strong potential for sustained value appreciation and continued market relevance.

Swan Bitcoin CEO Cory Klippsten said the market should brace for more instability in the days ahead, warning that macroeconomic forces are likely to keep influencing Bitcoin‚Äôs short-term movements. ‚ÄúIf the broader risk-off mood holds, Bitcoin can get dragged around a bit before it finds support and starts to decouple again,‚Äù Klippsten said. Market Wipeout Follows Tariff Announcement The crypto market saw over $8 billion in long liquidations within 24 hours, according to CoinGlass data. Bitcoin alone accounted for around $2.19 billion in liquidations, wiping out leveraged positions as prices fell sharply across exchanges. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got a little panic in the markets right now, classic macro whiplash. Trump and China are trading tariff threats, equities are off, and traders are scrambling to derisk,‚Äù Klippsten added. Ray Salmond, head of markets at Cointelegraph, said many traders ‚Äúwere totally caught off guard‚Äù by the speed of the sell-off. He described the tariff announcement as having ‚Äúsent shockwaves across the crypto market.‚Äù At the time of writing, Bitcoin had rebounded slightly, trading near $113,270, according to CoinMarketCap. Cascading Liquidations Across Exchanges Salmond highlighted how the price divergence between major trading platforms underscored the severity of the liquidation cascade. On Coinbase, the BTC/USD pair hit a low of $107,000, while Binance‚Äôs perpetual futures saw Bitcoin fall to $102,000. ‚ÄúThe dislocation really illustrates the severity of the cascading liquidations and how stops were completely obliterated,‚Äù Salmond explained. He referenced data from Hyblock, which revealed that nearly all downside long liquidity had been absorbed, leaving a liquidation cluster between $102,000 and $97,000. Tariffs and Past Price Reactions This isn‚Äôt the first time a tariff announcement from Trump has rattled the crypto markets. In April, similar trade measures triggered fears of a global slowdown and sent Bitcoin tumbling. On February 1, after Trump signed an executive order imposing tariffs on goods from China, Canada, and Mexico, Bitcoin briefly dipped below $100,000. Analysts View Dip as Opportunity Despite the turmoil, some analysts see the correction as a healthy market reset. Bitwise Invest‚Äôs senior investment strategist Juan Leon noted that ‚Äúthe best time to buy BTC has tended to be when it is being dragged down by broader markets.‚Äù Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise, reminded investors that buying during pullbacks is rarely comfortable but often beneficial. ‚ÄúIt never feels good when you buy the dip. The dip comes when sentiment drops. Writing the number down can be a good form of discipline,‚Äù Hougan said. Bitcoin‚Äôs sharp swings remain tied to macro events, but analysts maintain that the long-term outlook for the cryptocurrency remains intact.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MACROECONOMICS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-10-12 05:00:12

Here‚Äôs why",https://timestabloid.com/pundit-forget-market-cap-myth-xrp-can-hit-10-100-and-1000-heres-why/,"Recent remarks by crypto enthusiast BD have brought renewed attention to a controversial topic within the XRP community‚Äîhow high XRP can realistically go. Rather than focusing on external trends or unrelated comparisons, BD directly addressed a recurring argument: the claim that market capitalization prevents XRP from reaching significant price levels such as $10, $100, or higher. His comments drew contrasting responses, revealing ongoing disagreement over whether belief or hard valuation metrics determine XRP‚Äôs future. People love using market cap as an excuse to say XRP can‚Äôt hit $10, $100, or $1,000. But ask yourself this: if ‚Äúmarket cap‚Äù was the reason XRP can‚Äôt go higher, then how did it go from $0.004 in 2014 to $3.50 in 2018, and do it again in 2025? What limits the price isn‚Äôt reality.‚Ä¶ ‚Äî BD (@DiepSanh) October 10, 2025 BD‚Äôs Position on Price Limits and Market Cap BD questioned the widespread reliance on market cap as a conclusive barrier to XRP‚Äôs price growth. He pointed to XRP‚Äôs historical performance, referencing how the asset climbed from fractions of a cent in 2014 to over $3 in 2018. In his view, this past performance undermines the argument that market cap alone restricts potential upside. He suggested that limitations often come from investor perception rather than actual market mechanics, implying that belief and conviction play a role in driving speculative cycles. His stance aligns with long-term holders who argue that as adoption, liquidity, and utility expand, traditional valuation models may become less relevant. For these supporters, dismissing high price targets solely based on market cap calculations overlooks the unprecedented behavior of digital markets. Counterarguments Focused on Realistic Valuation In response, August offered a sharply contrasting perspective, emphasizing that belief cannot override economic reality. He outlined projections, noting that XRP at $10 would require a market cap of approximately $500 billion, at $100, around $5 trillion, and at $1,000, over $50 trillion‚Äîfigures exceeding the global money supply. August argued that XRP‚Äôs 2017 surge was driven by speculation rather than utility, concluding that real-world metrics ultimately constrain price, not sentiment. This viewpoint reflects a broader skepticism about extremely high valuations in the absence of substantial capital inflows or utility-driven demand. It also highlights a preference for assets perceived as more aligned with market fundamentals, such as Bitcoin . Moderate Expectations and Caution from Market Participants Toro Digital Assets offered a middle-ground perspective. While acknowledging that XRP may reach moderate targets, such as $10 under favorable circumstances, Toro rejected projections of $100 or $1,000. He emphasized the importance of understanding market mechanics and criticized long-term holders who have not taken profits despite having years of opportunity. Toro‚Äôs remarks focused on practical trading discipline rather than speculative optimism. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This approach underscores a segment of the community that supports XRP‚Äôs growth potential but rejects extreme valuations without fundamental justification. It also reflects a concern that unrealistic expectations can hinder portfolio performance. An Ongoing Divide Within the Community The exchange highlighted a fundamental divide among XRP supporters. BD‚Äôs emphasis on belief challenges conventional market frameworks, encouraging investors to reconsider perceived limitations. Opponents insist that speculative cycles alone cannot sustain disproportionate valuations without real capital backing. Between these positions are those who support long-term potential but call for measured expectations and strategic decision-making. Whether XRP can reach double or triple-digit prices will ultimately depend on adoption, institutional participation, and broader market conditions. Until then, belief and reality remain at odds, with the community divided on how far XRP can truly go. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Bitcoin price crashed to a low of $106,867, down by over 11% from its highest level this year. Altcoin had a worse performance, with some of the top laggards being tokens like Ethena (ENA), Mantle (MNT), Filecoin (FIL), and DoubleZero (ZZ). Altogether, the market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies plunged to $3.7 trillion, while total liquidations jumped to over $20 billion during the weekend. This article explores the main reasons why the crypto market crash happened and whether Bitcoin and altcoins will go back up soon. Why the crypto crash happened The crypto market crash happened as investors reacted to the new geopolitical issues between the US and China. These tensions have been boiling in the past few weeks as China has announced some major news targeting the US. For example, China has not imported any soybeans from the US in this season, leading to a substantial increase in inventories. Donald Trump has pledged to use some of the tariff revenue to help out farmers, many who are in states that he won. China has also asked its technology companies to avoid using American chips, especially those made by Nvidia. Beijing hopes that these countermeasures will help to supercharge the domestic chip industry. Further, the country announced measures to limit rare earth metal exports to the United States and other countries, and new tariffs on ships docking from the country. Therefore, Donald Trump announced major tariffs on goods from China, leading to a sense of fear among investors, which led to a stock and crypto market crash. The Fear and Greed Index moved to the fear zone as investors sold in panic. Will Bitcoin and other crypto go back up? The question among investors is whether the crypto market will go back up in the coming days. A closer look shows that most coins have already surged from their lowest level last week. Bitcoin price has jumped to $111,200 from a low of $108,500 last week. Zcash price has continued its relentless bull run that has pushed it from a low of $35 this month to $273 today. Other top coins that have rebounded are Story, MYX Finance, VeChain, and Morpho. The risk, however, is that the ongoing crypto market rebound is part of a dead-cat bounce, a situation where an asset in a freefall bounces back temporarily. Some potential catalysts may push the crypto market back up again. For example, industry may rebound because of the common phrase ‚ÄòTACO‚Äô, which means that Trump Always Chickens Out. As with the past, there is a likelihood that he will end the new tariffs by opting to negotiate with China. Also, the crypto and stock market will likely recover towards the upcoming meeting with Xi Jinping at the APEC meeting in South Korea. Such developments will be bullish for the stock and crypto market as they did earlier this year. Additionally, the crypto market always bounces back after a major crash as we experienced earlier this year. Bitcoin plummeted after Donald Trump‚Äôs Liberation Day in April and then jumped to a record high in the following month.

These assets, led by Cardano, Tron, MAGACOIN FINANCE , SUI, and Hyperliquid, are catching Institutional attention and are among the top tokens on many investors‚Äô watchlists. Cardano (ADA): Rebounding from Yearly Lows Cardano (ADA), which fell to a one-year low of below $0.30 during the October correction has surged to about $0.81. According to analysts‚Äô predictions, ADA is expected to fluctuate within the range of $0.805 to $0.926 until the end of October. However, an upside potential can be observed due to the rollout of Hydra. Hydra is the scaling framework of Cardano, aimed at boosting transaction throughput. Aside from the erratic market fluctuations caused by whales exiting their positions, Cardano‚Äôs inherent strength lies in its consistent development activity and deep DeFi integration. If ADA breaks out above $0.93, we could see a push towards $1.10. As a result, this makes ADA one of the best sub-$1 assets to buy the dip on ahead of the next market upturn. TRON (TRX): Quiet Strength in Unstable Markets TRON (TRX) is showing a remarkable strength after the massive sell-off of most coins. At the time of publication, TRON is trading at $0.334 as mid-October approaches. The coin was fluctuating between $0.334 ‚Äì $0.355, and the price range is being handled with ‚Äòcare‚Äô due to sustained user activity and network developments. Tron Price Chart: CoinMarketCap The TRON network has surpassed the 335 million accounts mark and continues to attract growth in both DeFi and stablecoins. The latest metrics show that it has cemented its position as one of the most used blockchain networks worldwide. Analysts believe TRX will see incremental gains if risk appetite improves, following the recent nearly 60% cut in transaction fees. For investors seeking dependable exposure under a dollar, TRON‚Äôs established ecosystem and history of revenue generation demonstrate resilience. MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGA): The Rising Sub-$1 Contender Among emerging assets, MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing significant attention as a high-upside, low-entry altcoin heading into Q4 2025. What distinguishes MAGACOIN FINANCE is its scarcity-driven model and strong community engagement. Analysts cite its verified audit status, early investor momentum, and growing wallet activity as indicators that the project could deliver huge ROI potential once it lists on exchanges. In a market seeking new narratives beyond Layer-1 tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a blend of transparency, utility, and early-stage opportunity that fits perfectly into current investor strategies for undervalued plays under $1 . SUI: Volatility Meets High Network Activity The market of SUI remains volatile and traders are able to continue taking advantage of this. The token is currently trading at about $3.46, which is significantly higher than the previous low of $2.81. This has been supported by a strong network throughput. While not technically under $1, SUI has seen dramatic price movements recently and strong developer mindshare. Thus, it is one of the most watched mid-cap projects for rotational capital. If a sentiment recovery were to take place, Analysts expect the price could recover towards the $3.80-4.20 range, enabling it to recover with the quality DeFi alternatives. HYPE (Hyperliquid): The Quiet Performer Hyperliquid (HYPE) has been performing spectacularly and was recently trading around the $39.24 mark. The token managed to climb over 1,100% since its launch in early 2024, while many other digital assets have endured a choppy market. HYPE price is above a $1 value. However, its structure and liquidity model driven by the community have made it a reference point for smaller altcoins. Hype Price Chart: Coinbase Since the sell-off in October, whale accumulation has maintained itself, providing stability and growth potential. Analysts predict consolidation in the range of $55 to $61 later this month, as speculators reposition for the next stage of the market cycle. Conclusion The market fear index at 35 reflects widespread caution, but it also underscores potential opportunity. ADA and TRX continue to trade below $1 with established ecosystems, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers early-stage growth and verified audit confidence, and SUI and HYPE illustrate how robust on-chain activity can support long-term recovery. Independent blockchain auditors at Hashex.org have labeled MAGACOIN FINANCE a legit, secure, and audit-approved project , positioning it among the most credible 2025 presale entries. For investors building diversified Q4 portfolios, these five altcoins combine low entry points, credible development paths, and asymmetric upside ‚Äî a mix that could define the next wave of crypto growth once sentiment improves.

According to the analyst, the recent decline is likely a precursor to a sudden and unpredictable market shock, often described as a ‚Äúblack swan.‚Äù Il Capo noted that this could be the first stage of a larger process, and that markets have yet to fully bottom. The analyst noted that while many altcoins are experiencing historic levels of capitulation, some major cryptocurrencies have yet to fully correct. He added that new lows could form below current price levels, and even levels considered ‚Äúbuy zones‚Äù could be broken. Il Capo noted that Bitcoin is still trading above the $100,000 level, and said a full correction could be completed in the $60,000-$70,000 range. He argued that downside risks remain unless this point is reached. Related News: This Is What Now the Crypto Community Is Talking About: Famous Figure Passes Away During Yesterday's Market Crash The analyst also noted that structural weaknesses are evident in traditional markets, adding that this fragility could cause short-term global shocks and that a kind of ‚Äúreset‚Äù process could occur before confidence is re-established. Finally, Il Capo of Crypto warned investors to be cautious, stating that markets may briefly trend sideways over the weekend, but the downward trend may accelerate again when global markets open next week. *This is not investment advice.

His focus is not on speculative narratives but on transaction mechanics, liquidity behavior, and institutional settlement flows. The explanation presents RLUSD as more than a stable asset‚Äîit is positioned as a functional tool that could alter how large-scale XRP acquisitions take place. RLUSD as a Settlement Medium for Institutions According to Xaif, the primary impact of RLUSD comes from its role in enabling institutions to acquire XRP without using traditional fiat pairs. By operating through a USD-pegged stable asset, institutions would gain the ability to execute high-volume purchases efficiently and without exposure to conversion delays or fiat volatility. This direct pathway, he argues, simplifies the acquisition process and allows significant capital to move through a single, stable channel designed for settlement purposes. In contrast to conventional trading pairs, RLUSD provides immediate liquidity for XRP transactions within Ripple-supported environments. This positions it as an operational instrument rather than a speculative token, intended to streamline institutional entry into XRP markets. THIS IS HOW $RLUSD WILL DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THE PRICE OF $XRP . pic.twitter.com/dfaWzBmE1c ‚Äî Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) October 10, 2025 Order-Book Mechanics and Price Acceleration Xaif‚Äôs core claim centers on how RLUSD-driven transactions could interact with exchange order books. When an institution deploys RLUSD to purchase XRP, it begins clearing available sell orders from the lowest price levels upward. If liquidity at these lower bands is thin, large buy orders would rapidly exhaust them, causing the market price to adjust to the next available range. This is framed as a mechanical outcome of concentrated demand meeting limited supply, rather than a reaction to sentiment. He explains that such activity could establish new price baselines once previous sell zones have been removed. The upward movement is not gradual in this scenario‚Äîit results from a direct depletion of available liquidity at key price points. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Institutional Example: The $1 Billion Acquisition Scenario To illustrate, Xaif presents a scenario in which a bank deposits $1 billion into RLUSD and proceeds to acquire XRP. In a simplified order book showing XRP offered at $0.50, $1.00, and $5.00, the institution‚Äôs order would absorb the lower prices entirely. As it moves upward through diminishing supply, purchasing would continue into higher tiers, potentially establishing prices, such as $5.00, as the new market standard. Xaif uses this scenario to demonstrate how institutional demand at scale would no longer engage with XRP in fragmented increments but through decisive, deep liquidity movements facilitated by RLUSD. Ongoing Utility and Feedback Effect The analysis also stresses that institutional purchasing through RLUSD is not a one-time event. Once XRP is acquired, it could then be used for international settlements, reinforcing its role as a functional asset rather than a tradable commodity. RLUSD remains central in this cycle, enabling consistent transactions and reduced operational friction. This repeated use creates a feedback effect: settlement utility encourages holding and usage, while continued acquisition diminishes lower-level liquidity, supporting sustained higher price levels over time.

Rather than promoting extreme figures, he focused on what he believes is achievable within this market cycle, based on expected institutional participation and regulatory developments. According to Rector, optimism should be rooted in fundamentals, not speculation. Institutional Inflows and Conservative Math Rector based his outlook on a straightforward model. He said if XRP receives between $5 billion and $10 billion in inflows through institutional products such as ETFs, the impact on market capitalization could be substantial. He referenced a historical multiplier effect where capital inflows can lead to a 100x increase in market cap. Under that scenario, $10 billion entering XRP could translate to a $1 trillion rise in value, aligning with a price range of $17 to $20 per token. He emphasized that these are not aggressive projections, but figures derived from conservative assumptions using transparent calculations, rather than unverifiable theories or speculative narratives. $17-$20 XRP pic.twitter.com/C84msB3DG4 ‚Äî Zach Rector (@ZachRector7) October 10, 2025 Regulatory Timing and ETF Expectations A critical part of Rector‚Äôs analysis is tied to regulatory progress. He pointed to the pending approval of XRP-based exchange-traded funds , which he expects to follow once regulatory operations resume. In his view, the introduction of ETFs would unlock a new phase of institutional access, enabling the level of capital required to validate his price model. Rector suggested that confidence in XRP‚Äôs future should be supported by these upcoming structural changes in the market, not by unrealistic timelines for dramatic price movements. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Rejecting Extreme Short-Term Targets In addressing concerns from impatient investors, Rector made it clear that forecasts such as $10,000 this year are not grounded in current market conditions. He urged the XRP community to align expectations with measurable growth scenarios. Rector position is that remaining positive does not mean relying on improbable outcomes, but rather on the credible impact of institutional inflows and broader market adoption. A Case Built on Fundamentals Rector‚Äôs overall message reinforces disciplined optimism. By focusing on regulatory advancements, institutional access, and conservative market modeling, he presented $17‚Äì$20 as a realistic upper range for XRP under favorable conditions. His approach serves as a reminder that sustained growth in digital assets will be driven by capital structure and real-world integration, not speculation alone. In summary, his outlook is neither speculative nor exaggerated‚Äîit is a case grounded in tangible developments and pragmatic expectations.

It‚Äôs not just about speculation; it‚Äôs about belonging to a group that enjoys the ride together. Dogecoin: The Original Meme Coin That Started It All Dogecoin remains the undisputed pioneer of meme tokens. What began as a joke in 2013 has evolved into a symbol of crypto culture. It‚Äôs widely known for its friendly Shiba Inu mascot, loyal fanbase, and community-driven movement that helped shape the entire meme coin era. While many meme coins have come and gone, Dogecoin remains a prominent cryptocurrency by market cap. Its enduring popularity stems from being simple, fast, and supported by a massive online community. The token‚Äôs appeal lies not in complex mechanics but in its cultural power and positive identity. Dogecoin also benefits from wide adoption and consistent use as a payment option. With its strong market presence, liquidity, and visibility, it remains a cornerstone in every conversation about meme coins. Even after more than a decade, Dogecoin still symbolizes the fun side of crypto and reminds investors why the meme movement started in the first place.

Traditionally, all the big Bitcoin rallies have been the aftermath of an epic altcoin season during which newer coins whose underpinnings are solid deliver big gains. During this cycle, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the breakout star. While Bitcoin remains one of the best performers, Mutuum Finance is promising investors the next giant in DeFi. Already in Phase 6 of presale, MUTM is valued only at $0.035 with the presale phase boasting over 65% sold out. So far, the project has been able to raise over $17.25 million courtesy of having been able to attract over 16,860 dedicated investors. As Bitcoin forms the foundation of the current bull run, Mutuum Finance is proving to be the high-potential altcoin that will bring the next explosion in fast growth within the decentralized finance. Bitcoins‚Äô New Age The classical four-year cycle of rallies driven by the halving is slipping away from Bitcoin, believes BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes. He is sure that the BTC price is increasingly unrelated to the mining rewards and is connected with the global trends of liquidity rather, so the price increasingly less corresponds to the blockchain mechanics underlying. His theses are justified by the data, Bitcoin has gained over 47% since June stimulated by enormous injections of the People‚Äôs Bank of China‚Äôs, as well as the U.S. Federal Reserve‚Äôs, liquidity. If this new pattern is continued, the next rally by Bitcoin will perhaps not wait for the 2028 halving but rather gain speed together with the current inflows of capital and relaxing monetary terms. Mutuum Finance Shines in 2025 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is all good steam ahead, having raised well over $17.25 million during Phase 6 presale and having taken in over 16,860 individual holders. Well over 65% of Phase 6 has been sold up to present. The early bird investors are positioning themselves for hopefully humongous paydays when MUTM debuts on the open market. Mutuum Finance Lending & Borrowing Protocol Expected Mutuum Finance is planning to deploy its lending and borrowing protocol , Version 1, onto the Sepolia Testnet during Q4 2025. The protocol will include liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, as well as a liquidator bot. ETH will be supported alongside USDT on the inaugural day to be open to lending, borrowing, as well as collateralization, to set up an all-purpose DeFi platform oriented around convenience, security, as well as usability. Mutuum Finance protocol is founded on the close-order book architecture for market risk management as well as illiquidity protection. Basic components like close-level terms, liquidation levels, and liquidator incentives are properly dynamically determined such that secure and reliable lending is sanctioned. The Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios as well as the liquidation factors are dynamically changed based on the volatility of the assets such that riskier assets are managed under harsher loan term. Extra risk-weighted multipliers are also employed over the specified asset classes for stability, security, as well as resilience even under stress market conditions. Top Cryptocurrencies to Invest in Now With Bitcoin rocketing above $125,000 and redrawing the market story beyond the cycles of halving, intelligent investors are keenly searching correlated plays with better growth prospects, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly becoming the obvious frontrunner. Priced as low as $0.035 during Phase 6 presale, the coin has already raised over $17.25 million from over 16,860+ investors, with over 65% of the tokens sold. The dual-lending platform, risk-adjusted preset LTV architecture, and close-order book design set the new benchmark for security and scalability for decentralised finance. Helped by the brilliant presale success and an upcoming lending and borrowing protocol launch on Sepolia Testnet later this quarter, the presale by Mutuum Finance is poised to ride the same liquidity-driven uptrend powering the growth in Bitcoin. Get into the presale by Mutuum Finance today and take an early seat before the market explodes.

The broader market remains cautious as traders reassess their positions following recent volatility, which could lead to a reversal of the bullish trend. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, ETH recently broke below the midline of its ascending channel, the 100-day moving average, and touched the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level near $3,400-$3,500. This zone coincides with the previous structure support, triggering a bounce toward $3,800. However, the RSI is still below 40, showing weak momentum. A daily close back above $4,000 could mark a short-term recovery, but failure to reclaim the channel would likely send ETH below the $3,000 range, which would mean the end of the bull market. The 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour chart reveals that Ethereum found temporary support within the $3,400 demand zone after a sharp decline. The RSI also dipped into the oversold area, and is now near 24, suggesting a potential short-term reversal. Still, resistance at $3,800 remains critical. A rejection there could lead to another retest of $3,400, while a clean breakout may open the path toward $4,200 again. Onchain Analysis Funding Rates Funding rates across exchanges have plunged into negative territory, the lowest since late 2024, as traders rushed to unwind long positions. This reset indicates fear and liquidation pressure, but could also hint at a potential bottom if the bearish sentiment continues while the price stabilizes. Historically, negative funding rates during deep pullbacks have preceded short-term recoveries once selling momentum fades. Therefore, while the market could be in the early stages of a bearish reversal, there is still hope that this move could just be a flush out to cool off the futures market and pave the way for a spot-driven, sustainable rally.

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC‚Äôs price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin‚Äôs price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin‚Äôs role in the so-called ‚ÄúTrump trade,‚Äù with the president-elect‚Äôs positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin‚Äôs on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: ‚ÄúDoes Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWill Bitcoin go up?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhere will Bitcoin be in 5 years?‚Äù Let‚Äôs answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction.

However, the price is now aiming for a consolidation within a bearish channel above $110K. BTC price analysis 1-day chart: Bitcoin faces strong bearish pressure Analyzing the daily Bitcoin price chart, we see that Bitcoin faces bearish pressure as it crashed way below $110K. Currently, the BTC price is facing selling domination around immediate support channels. The 24-hour volume has surged to $2.91B, showing a surge in trading interest today. BTC is trading at $111,691, declining by over 0.3% in the last 24 hours. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has dropped from its previous level and trades at 41, hinting that a bearish correction is on the edge. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. BTC/USD 4-hour price chart: Bearish domination rises around EMA trend lines The 4-hour Bitcoin price chart suggests that bulls are strengthening their position to hold the price above the EMA trend lines. However, sellers are aiming for a trend continuation below $120K. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a negative region at 0.62, showing that short-term sellers are taking a chance to accelerate a downward trend. Additionally, the MACD indicator has formed red candles below the signal line, and the indicator aims for negative momentum, strengthening short-position holders‚Äô confidence.

The hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin is attempting to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a recovery rally in the coming hours. If BTC‚Äôs price holds momentum above $114,703, it will fuel a bullish rally to $126,118. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $108,476, beginning a bearish trend to $104,902. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin down today? Bitcoin faced a surge in selling demand as buyers failed to push the price above Fib levels. The recent market crash was triggered by Trump‚Äôs tariff announcement. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $120K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC As reported by Cryptopolitan , the Bitcoin mining industry had a powerful September as the total value of major publicly traded miners surged to $58.1 billion. Bitcoin price prediction October 2025 Bitcoin‚Äôs price jumped to $118,000, making a minor recovery in September. However, it declined later and saw heavy accumulation, which could mean we‚Äôll see a peak around October 2025. Bitcoin‚Äôs price might attempt to maintain an average price of $111,000 and be pushed further, at least $118,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $105,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction October 2025 $105,000 $111,000 $118,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin‚Äôs trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026. Bitcoin price prediction 2027 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491. The potential maximum price is estimated to be $216,738, with an average value of $170,100. Bitcoin price prediction 2028 By 2028, Bitcoin‚Äôs price is expected to reach a low of $164,063. Maximum price projections are as high as $244,142, averaging about $185,068 for the year. Bitcoin price forecast 2029 Projections for 2029 suggest that Bitcoin could be valued at a minimum of $195,629. The price may peak at as much as $255,321, with an average throughout the year expected to be around $200,312. Bitcoin (BTC) price prediction 2030 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin‚Äôs price could start at a minimum of $225,903 and potentially rise to a maximum of $270,593. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $248,568 throughout the year. Bitcoin price prediction 2031 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin‚Äôs price could start at a minimum of $285,058 and potentially rise to a maximum of $350,548. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $303,555 throughout the year.

Cathie Wood of Ark Invest forecasts Bitcoin may hit $600,000 by 2030, with a potential rise to $1.5 million in her bull case scenario after Bitcoin ETF approval (Bitcoin exchange traded funds). Cryptopolitan‚Äôs Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction A surge in bitcoin adoption and the expansion of the Bitcoin ecosystem might end the controversy of ‚ÄúBitcoin bubble‚Äù in future. This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen the Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin‚Äôs future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin‚Äôs future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history: Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin‚Äôs price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin‚Äôs value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year‚Äôs start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October‚Äôs Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump‚Äôs victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone. In May, Bitcoin price skyrocketed and it formed a new ATH at $111,970. However, the price declined later, toward $104K. By the end of June, BTC price reclaimed the $108K level. In July, BTC price triggered a surge toward $123K; however, it faced strong selling pressure later. In mid-August, the price of Bitcoin surged above $124K. However, the price failed to maintain its momentum as it dropped below $110K in early-September. By the end of September, the price of Bitcoin dropped further and touched a low around $108K.",Crypto Price Predictions|BTC,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|UNI|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-12 07:35:13

The asset broke multiple key technical structures on both the daily and 4-hour charts as panic selling swept through the crypto sector. While the price has shown early signs of stabilization near $2.4, the market remains fragile and highly sensitive to further macro developments. Ripple Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart The crypto market faced one of its sharpest single-day selloffs following U.S. President Donald Trump‚Äôs tweet threatening a 100% tariff on Chinese imports, which sparked widespread risk aversion across global markets. Within hours, nearly $900 billion in crypto market capitalization was wiped out, before staging a minor recovery. XRP plunged from the $3.0‚Äì$3.1 resistance band, decisively breaking below the multi-month symmetrical triangle that had been forming since July. The rejection from the descending trendline coincided with the market-wide collapse, sending XRP toward the $1.2 threshold, indicating a 55% decline. Despite the magnitude of the crash, the broader macro structure remains technically intact as long as the price holds above the green ascending trendline, which connects the major higher lows established earlier in 2025. A rebound from this region could preserve the long-term bullish structure and set the stage for a higher-low continuation pattern. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour chart, the extent of the macro-driven shock becomes even clearer. XRP sliced through both the mid-range structure and the $2.8 horizontal demand zone, triggering widespread stop-losses and forced liquidations among overleveraged long positions. The wick below $1.2 underscores the depth of panic selling, while the sharp rebound that followed signals early signs of stabilization as buyers stepped in to absorb the capitulation wave. At present, XRP is attempting to reclaim the broken $2.7‚Äì$2.8 zone, which has now flipped into short-term resistance. A successful close above this region, followed by a retest as support, could mark the beginning of a relief rally toward $3, where the next supply cluster resides. Failure to reclaim this area, however, would confirm that bears still maintain short-term control, likely extending the correction toward the $2.2‚Äì$2.0 region in the coming sessions. Momentum indicators reinforce this mixed outlook. The RSI has entered deeply oversold territory, suggesting that sellers may be losing strength and that a rebound could soon materialize. Yet, recovery is expected to remain volatile and sentiment-driven, heavily dependent on how broader markets digest the implications of the tariff announcement.

A crypto PR agency helps blockchain and Web3 projects build credibility, visibility, and trust. Services often include media outreach, thought leadership placement, crisis communications, and narrative development. The best agencies also offer strategic guidance on timing, positioning, and storytelling that aligns with a project‚Äôs goals and stage of growth. 2. How is crypto PR different from traditional tech PR? Crypto PR requires navigating a faster news cycle, a skeptical audience, and regulatory complexity. It blends mainstream media relations with community engagement across Twitter, Telegram, and Discord. Successful agencies understand tokenomics, on-chain data, and the nuances of market sentiment ‚Äî not just press releases. 3. What makes Outset PR stand out from other agencies? Outset PR combines boutique-level partnership with data intelligence. Its proprietary system, Outset Data Pulse, tracks crypto media performance and adoption trends to help clients launch campaigns at the perfect moment and in the right outlets. This data-first model replaces guesswork with measurable insight, allowing founders to see how narratives evolve and which strategies actually drive credibility. 4. How much do crypto PR campaigns cost? Budgets vary widely by scope and goals. Smaller startups may spend $5,000‚Äì$10,000 per month for media support, while established companies or multi-region campaigns can exceed $30,000 monthly. What matters most isn‚Äôt price but transparency ‚Äî top agencies provide clear deliverables, timelines, and metrics rather than vague promises of ‚Äúexposure.‚Äù 5. How can a PR agency help a Web3 startup grow? PR builds legitimacy ‚Äî something no ad spend can buy. The right agency can secure coverage in respected outlets, craft a strong founder narrative, and help investors and users view a project as trustworthy and credible. In competitive markets, that perception often determines adoption and funding outcomes. 6. What‚Äôs the role of data in modern crypto PR? Data is becoming the foundation of effective communication. By analyzing coverage patterns, keyword traction, and sentiment shifts, agencies can predict when to launch stories and where they‚Äôll perform best. Outset PR‚Äôs Data Pulse platform is a prime example of how analytics is reshaping PR strategy in 2025. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

This Is Your Moment (Analyst),https://cryptopotato.com/want-to-buy-the-dogecoin-dip-this-is-your-moment-analyst/,"As the wildest market crash in the recent history of cryptocurrency markets unfolded on Friday and Saturday morning, no altcoin was spared from the adverse events that wiped out $900 billion from the entire capitalization. Naturally, the ever-volatile meme coin sector felt some of the worst consequences, including its leader. Dogecoin traded at around $0.25 on Friday, before the Trump-induced panic sent it nosediving to under $0.10 on many exchanges. It‚Äôs worth noting that this wick meant that DOGE had dumped to its lowest price position in just over a year. It immediately bounced off in the following minutes and hours and has settled at around $0.19. Daan Crypto Trades exemplified the overall behavior by most altcoins, including the OG meme coin. It plunged by roughly 70% from top to bottom before it bounced to about halfway through the entire move. What typically follows is a sideways chop before another correction of 10% to 20%. ‚ÄúI think these charts would get interesting the moment they breach those initial highs from the bounces. That can be the confirmation on the trade. From that point, up until the start of the dumps, there are these 15%-30% inefficiencies/gaps which likely get filled relatively easily if price were to get to that point. As long as prices are below that point, I‚Äôm assuming to see a relatively volatile chop.‚Äù DOGEUSD. Source: TradingView The current price tag could be quite impactful for DOGE‚Äôs future movements. Data from popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlights the significance of this level. As such, he noted that this could be a ‚Äústrong buy-the-dip zone‚Äù that could propel the asset forward. Martinez outlined a substantial increase to $0.48, which sounds rather far-fetched at the moment, given the latest developments and current market sentiment. $0.19 looks like a strong buy-the-dip zone for Dogecoin $DOGE before a potential run toward $0.48. pic.twitter.com/e7Q4ocSLO2 ‚Äî Ali (@ali_charts) October 12, 2025 The post Want to Buy the Dogecoin Dip?

Their greatest strength is establishing legitimacy: putting an official statement on record, anchoring a milestone, and giving stakeholders a durable citation to reference. If you‚Äôre wondering, do crypto press releases still drive real results , the nuanced answer is yes‚Äîbut they work as an image tool first and only rarely as a direct demand-gen lever. Yes, there are cases where a release appears to spark inbound, but attribution in the wild is messy. A founder may claim ‚Äúthe press release brought us clients,‚Äù when the real driver was subsequent organic coverage, community buzz, or word of mouth that the release merely helped seed. In other words, press releases seldom operate as a direct lead-gen trigger; they enable credibility so other channels can convert. Why the ‚ÄúImage Tool‚Äù Framing Wins in Crypto Record & permanence. A release creates a citable, timestamped artifact for journalists, partners, and investors‚Äîproof you can point to‚Äîwhich is critical in a fast, rumor-prone market. Milestone anchoring. Pairing a release with a mainnet launch, listing, or audit gives your story structure that downstream coverage can build on. Search visibility. Syndication supports backlinks and discoverability; that‚Äôs brand infrastructure, not lead capture. Stakeholder signaling. Institutions, exchanges, and partners read ‚Äúofficialness‚Äù as operational maturity, even if retail audiences don‚Äôt engage deeply. By contrast, lead generation in crypto is earned elsewhere‚Äîthrough founder threads, useful long-form posts, meaningful integrations, exclusive pitches, and hands-on community programs. Releases can assist those motions, but crypto press releases are not your primary lead engine . In Practice As an image tool: Press releases validate that an event happened and signal professionalism‚Äîthat‚Äôs the job they do best. As a lead-gen trigger: Effects are indirect, sporadic, and hard to attribute; exclusive crypto articles, strategic partnerships, and founder-led content almost always outperform for net-new opportunities. As brand architecture: Treat releases as components of your credibility stack‚Äîif leads come, consider it a bonus, not the target. A Simple Playbook Define the job. If you need record/SEO/stakeholder proof, a release fits. If you need pipeline, prioritize exclusive coverage, partner co-marketing, AMAs, demos, and founder narratives. Sequence smartly. Launch thread or blog ‚Üí brief key reporters/partners ‚Üí then issue the release to cement the record and feed search. Measure correctly. Track citations, backlinks, partner replies, and analyst interest‚Äînot just traffic from the wire. For leads, attribute to the coverage and community touchpoints your release helped unlock. Keep standards high. Clear headline/subhead, hard facts, links to audits/docs, quotes with real content, and a crisp CTA (docs, demo, testnet). Press releases in crypto are image infrastructure, not a pipeline engine‚Äî use them to anchor milestones, create a citable record, and support SEO ‚Äîthen let founder threads, exclusives, partner co-marketing, and community programs convert. Treat any leads as a bonus, not the KPI; greenlight only when the job is clear (record, SEO, visibility, proof, or access) and measure success by citations, backlinks, partner replies, and analyst interest‚Äînot wire traffic.",More News,EN,0,0,SPONSORED|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET,"{'name': 'Crypto Daily', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptodaily,2025-10-12 07:49:30

The discussions highlighted Ripple‚Äôs ambitions across Europe and Luxembourg, signaling a deepening partnership between one of the world‚Äôs leading blockchain firms and a nation at the forefront of digital finance innovation. According to Minister Roth, the meeting centered on Ripple‚Äôs strategic objectives and Luxembourg‚Äôs ongoing commitment to fostering digital innovation. ‚ÄúGreat meeting with Ripple, as they advance toward securing their license to operate in Luxembourg. We discussed their ambitions in Europe and Luxembourg, and I reaffirmed our commitment to digital innovation,‚Äù Roth said, emphasizing the alignment between Ripple‚Äôs growth plans and Luxembourg‚Äôs regulatory vision. A driving force behind Ripple‚Äôs European expansion is the sheer scale of the continent‚Äôs financial flows. Europe processes over $200 trillion annually in cross-border payments, a market ripe for disruption by blockchain solutions that promise speed, cost efficiency, and transparency. Ripple‚Äôs technology, which facilitates near-instant settlement and reduces reliance on traditional correspondent banking networks, positions it as a compelling solution for financial institutions navigating the increasingly complex cross-border payments landscape. Notably, Luxembourg and Ripple are pushing beyond payments into asset tokenization, with analysts projecting over $80 trillion in real-world assets (RWAs) could be digitized in the next decade. Therefore, this fusion of blockchain innovation and regulatory backing positions Luxembourg as a global hub for digital finance, with Ripple leading the charge. XRP Faces Heavy Correction After Sharp Rejection at $2.80 XRP has entered a pronounced downtrend following a sharp rejection at the critical $2.80 resistance level, according to market analyst Ether Guru. Currently trading at $2.40, the token has lost nearly 15% of its value, signaling extended downside momentum as bearish forces dominate the market. The recent price action highlights a clear failure to maintain bullish momentum above $2.80, a level that had initially sparked optimism among traders. Ether Guru notes that this rejection underscores a shift in market sentiment, with sellers overwhelming buyers and pushing XRP toward key support zones. The market is showing classic signs of a heavy correction, with lower highs and sustained selling pressure indicating that the bears are firmly in control. Notably, technical indicators reinforce this bearish outlook. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has plunged into oversold territory, reflecting mounting selling pressure and weakening buying interest. Meanwhile, moving averages suggest a downward trajectory, as XRP struggles to reclaim levels that were previously considered pivotal for bullish continuation. Therefore, analysts are now closely monitoring the $2.20‚Äì$2.30 zone, which may serve as a short-term support, though breaking below this range could trigger further losses and extend the correction toward the $2.00 mark. Ether Guru warns that investors should exercise caution amid heightened volatility. While cryptocurrency markets are notorious for rapid rebounds, the current momentum favors bears, making short-term rallies unlikely without significant buying pressure. Conclusion XRP‚Äôs sharp pullback to $2.40 highlights the dominance of bears after failing to sustain momentum above $2.80. While short-term pressure persists, XRP‚Äôs long-term prospects remain tied to adoption and broader market dynamics, underscoring the importance of both technical and fundamental analysis in navigating this volatile market. With Ripple advancing toward a Luxembourg license, the stage is set for a transformative shift in Europe‚Äôs financial landscape. By combining blockchain efficiency with regulatory alignment, Ripple is poised to streamline cross-border payments and accelerate the tokenization of real-world assets, positioning both itself and Luxembourg at the forefront of the next wave of digital finance innovation.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|XRP|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-12 07:54:46

In crypto‚Äîwhere cycles are fast and attention is fragmented‚Äîthe what, who, and why behind your announcement determine whether a release lands or gets ignored. Which crypto press release types actually drive real results? The short answer: the ones that align the announcement type with a clear audience and a measurable outcome. Below is a practical typology that links event ‚Üí audience ‚Üí strategic implication so you can quickly judge whether a press release is worth it‚Äîand what success should look like. 1) Product Announcements Typical examples: token launches, protocol upgrades, feature rollouts, mainnet/testnet milestones.Primary audience: existing community, power users, developers, crypto-native media. Impact profile Most resonance comes from people who already know you. Breaks wider if the release solves a pressing crypto industry problem (e.g., reduced fees, novel security, real UX unlock). Works best paired with technical docs, a founder thread on X, and a concise ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs new / why it matters‚Äù explainer. Use a press release when: you need an official record for journalists/investors, citations, or SEO.Skip it when: the story is incremental; ship an owned post/thread first, then backfill with a release if traction warrants. KPIs to watch: on-chain usage lift, doc visits, GitHub stars/PRs, waitlist signups, citations by media/analysts.Pitfalls: jargon-heavy copy, no demo link, generic quotes. 2) Financial Announcements Typical examples: fundraising rounds, venture backing, strategic investments, treasury disclosures.Primary audience: B2B partners, exchanges, market makers, institutional and sophisticated retail, analysts. Impact profile Crypto credibility builder ‚Äîespecially when paired with named, reputable funds. Can directly unlock BD conversations and integrations. Smaller raises still work if framed around strategic narrative (team, roadmap, traction). Use a press release when: you want third-party validation documented and discoverable.Skip it when: details are vague (undisclosed amounts/participants) or timing conflicts with market noise. KPIs to watch: inbound BD volume, partner replies, analyst coverage, qualified investor interest.Pitfalls: overclaiming, burying the lead (who invested, how much, why now). 3) Partnership & Integration Announcements Typical examples: exchange listings , wallet integrations, protocol collaborations, oracle/data feeds, L2/L3 deployments.Primary audience: partner ecosystems, users at the integration surface, devs looking for plug-and-play components. Impact profile Often the highest immediate growth potential because you inherit a partner‚Äôs distribution. Works well with co-marketing (joint quotes, shared social calendars, cross-posted docs). Use a press release when: you need shared visibility and a durable, citable artifact across both ecosystems.Skip it when: the integration is minor or temporary‚Äîuse a social thread + docs update. KPIs to watch: new wallets/users from partner channels, integration adoption, referral traffic, liquidity/TVL shifts.Pitfalls: lack of partner amplification, weak ‚Äúwhy this matters‚Äù narrative. 4) Regulatory & Infrastructure Announcements Typical examples: licenses, audits/compliance milestones , SOC2/ISO, participation in standards bodies, infra hardening.Primary audience: regulators, enterprises, institutions, risk teams, exchanges. Impact profile Low sizzle for retail; high trust for stakeholders who control bigger decisions. Credibility compounds over time; helps with listings, enterprise deals, and analyst coverage. Use a press release when: you need a trust signal and searchable proof of compliance.Skip it when: the milestone is internal or not yet verifiable. KPIs to watch: enterprise RFP invites, listing progression, analyst briefings, security review pass-through.Pitfalls: vague claims without documents, missing audit links, no quotes from compliance/partners. 5) Research & Analytical Announcements Typical examples: industry reports, crypto user/market data , network analyses, security findings, benchmarks.Primary audience: journalists, analysts, funds, founders, policy thinkers. Impact profile Underused but high-leverage: positions your team as a source, not just a subject. Earns repeat coverage and inbound partnerships; fuels thought leadership for quarters, not days. Use a press release when: you want editorial interest and backlinks to a data hub or report.Skip it when: the methodology is thin or the insight is already common knowledge. KPIs to watch: media citations, backlinks to the report, analyst briefings, speaking invites.Pitfalls: conclusions without methodology, gated PDFs with no summary, lack of actionable insights. Choosing the Right Format (Press Release vs. Owned Post) Ask these five questions before you greenlight a release: Outcome: What single job does this do‚Äîrecord, SEO, visibility, proof, or access? Audience: Who actually needs this format‚Äîjournalists, algorithms, investors, gatekeepers? Narrative strength: Is there a real ‚Äúwhy now‚Äù beyond housekeeping? Partner lift: Will someone else amplify (fund, exchange, integration partner)? Measurement: Which metric will prove it worked? If you can‚Äôt answer clearly, publish a founder thread or blog first, then revisit a release if traction appears. Do these crypto press release types actually work? They do‚Äîwhen the format matches the audience and outcome. A Simple Mapping: Event ‚Üí Audience ‚Üí Impact Product ‚Üí community/devs ‚Üí usage lift if it solves a real pain Financial ‚Üí B2B/institutional ‚Üí credibility + BD doors Partnership/Integration ‚Üí partner users ‚Üí fastest route to visible traction Regulatory/Infrastructure ‚Üí enterprises/regulators ‚Üí trust that compounds Research/Analytics ‚Üí media/analysts/funds ‚Üí thought leadership and durable backlinks Conclusion: What Actually Moves the Needle? Which types of crypto press releases drive real results? Near-term visibility & growth: Partnership/Integration Credibility & BD leverage: Financial; Regulatory/Infrastructure Community activation & adoption: Product (when it fixes a real problem) Durable authority & inbound: Research/Analytics Bottom line: Press releases work when the type of news meets the right audience with a clear outcome and proof links.

Historically dubbed ‚ÄúUptober‚Äù, this month has produced some of the largest Bitcoin rallies over the past decade ‚Äì and analysts believe history may soon repeat itself. Meanwhile, investors are turning their eyes toward MAGACOIN FINANCE, a project that has already gone through full CertiK and HashEx audits and is expanding at an exponential rate. With analysts projecting up to 20,000% ROI, the token is quickly becoming one of the top picks for diversified portfolios ahead of the next crypto breakout. Bitcoin‚Äôs ‚ÄúUptober‚Äù Trend Could Spark a 21% Rally Economist Timothy Peterson noted that October declines of more than 5% are extremely rare for Bitcoin. Over the past ten years, this has occurred only four times ‚Äì in 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2021. In three of those years, Bitcoin rebounded immediately within the following week, gaining 16% in 2017, 4% in 2018, and 21% in 2019. The only exception was 2021, when the market corrected further before entering a prolonged rally in November. According to data from CoinGlass, October has historically been Bitcoin‚Äôs second-best performing month, averaging 20.10% returns since 2013. Only November has done better, with average gains exceeding 46%. If this pattern continues, Bitcoin could jump to around $124,000 within a week, nearly reclaiming its recent all-time high of $125,100. Market Conditions Point to a Possible Recovery Bitcoin recently fell to $102,000 after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a 100% tariff on Chinese imports, triggering a wave of liquidations across the crypto market. Within hours, however, the leading cryptocurrency rebounded to over $112,000, showing early signs of strength. At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades near $111,700, stabilizing after what analysts described as one of the sharpest intraday drops in months. Many market watchers see this as a potential ‚Äúflush-out event‚Äù similar to those that have historically marked cycle bottoms. Prominent industry figures also remain optimistic. Samson Mow, founder of Jan3, reminded followers that ‚Äúthere are still 21 days left in Uptober,‚Äù while Michael van de Poppe, CEO of MN Trading Capital, said the market has likely reached ‚Äúthe bottom of the current cycle.‚Äù These views echo previous cycles when steep liquidations were followed by rapid recoveries. ‚ÄúCOVID-19 was the bottom of the previous cycle,‚Äù one analyst noted, adding that ‚Äúmass liquidations often mark turning points.‚Äù MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Hidden Gem with 20,000% Potential While Bitcoin captures headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to dominate investor discussions as the fastest-growing audited project in the altcoin sector. With both CertiK and HashEx certifications, the project has already proven its technical security and transparency ‚Äì two factors that have drawn serious attention from early adopters. MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äôs presale phases saw massive demand, with sellouts happening in record time. Its community is expanding daily, and investors are calling it the next breakout success of 2025. The project‚Äôs long-term roadmap focuses on real-world utility, ecosystem expansion, and continuous development ‚Äì ensuring that it‚Äôs not just another short-lived token hype. Analysts predict that as the next bull market gains traction, MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver up to 20,000% ROI, rivaling the legendary returns seen by early investors in SHIBA INU and DOGECOIN. With listings expected soon and momentum building fast, many believe MAGACOIN FINANCE could outperform every major altcoin once the market turns bullish again. In a year defined by volatility, it‚Äôs rare to see a project maintain such consistent growth. For investors looking to balance their portfolios with high-upside opportunities, MAGACOIN FINANCE has become one of the most discussed picks of 2025. If History Repeats, Bitcoin Could Lead the Next Wave If Bitcoin follows its traditional October pattern, a 21% surge could propel it back near its all-time highs, reigniting optimism across the entire crypto market. Such a move would likely lift major altcoins along with it ‚Äì especially those with strong fundamentals and active development. Historically, Bitcoin rallies in October and November have led to capital rotation into mid-cap and emerging tokens shortly after. If that trend holds, the coming weeks could present a golden window for projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which combine security, growth, and strong community engagement. While the short-term market remains uncertain, on-chain metrics and historical data both point to a familiar pattern: major rebounds tend to begin when fear is at its highest. If that plays out again this year, Bitcoin and high-potential altcoins may be preparing for another explosive chapter. Conclusion The crypto market may have endured one of its most volatile months yet, but history suggests a comeback could be imminent. With Bitcoin‚Äôs October track record averaging 20% gains, the stage is set for a potential rebound toward $124,000 within days. At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming a star of this market cycle ‚Äì an audited, fast-growing project that could deliver life-changing returns for early adopters. As new capital prepares to flow back into the market, this could be one of the last chances for investors to position themselves ahead of the next major surge.

Most altcoins have shown similar behavior over the past day, but there are some gainers even from the larger caps, such as BNB. BTC Calms at $112K The business week began in an impressive manner for the BTC bulls as the cryptocurrency skyrocketed to two consecutive all-time highs last Sunday and Monday. The latest record came at just over $126,000. What followed was a minor correction and sideways trading at around $122,000. That level held until Friday evening when the US President Donald Trump threatened and then officially announced a new set of tariffs against China. In the span of just a few hours, bitcoin‚Äôs price tumbled from $122,000 to $101,000 on some exchanges. This caused a cascade of liquidations, which became the single-largest day of wrecked positions worth over $19 billion, according to CoinGlass. BTC bounced off as most short positions were closed and briefly exceeded $114,000, which only intensified the liquidations. It has failed there for now and sits close to $112,000 as of press time.

Financial Coach Shares Honest Opinion,https://timestabloid.com/swift-taking-out-xrp-financial-coach-shares-honest-opinion/,"Concerns have recently surfaced among cryptocurrency holders following claims that SWIFT‚Äôs involvement with other blockchain networks could diminish XRP‚Äôs relevance. Financial educator Coach JV directly responded to these concerns, offering a firm clarification. Rather than dismissing the topic lightly, he focused on providing a reasoned perspective grounded in the long-term fundamentals of Ripple and XRP. His message was aimed at investors who may be reacting emotionally to announcements without understanding the broader infrastructural landscape. Clarifying the SWIFT and XRP Misconception Coach JV began by addressing the central question head-on: whether SWIFT is ‚Äútaking out‚Äù XRP. His response was definitive, stating that such a belief is fundamentally incorrect. He emphasized that basing financial decisions on isolated announcements or speculation can be damaging. According to him, the financial system is currently transitioning into a new era that is not governed by a single winner, but rather by increased competition and interoperability. He referred to recent public commentary from U.S. financial officials discussing collaboration between the public and private sectors, underlining that innovation is entering a stage where multiple technologies will coexist. Rather than viewing SWIFT‚Äôs developments as a threat, he framed them as part of a broader evolution in global finance. Competition and Long-Term Vision Coach JV underscored his belief that competition is healthy for the industry. As someone who owns multiple companies, he stated that competition empowers consumers to make informed choices. He reiterated his conviction that Ripple and XRP will continue to play a critical role in transforming the financial system, due to their established infrastructure and consistent development. He pointed to XRP‚Äôs leadership as a testament to its resilience. Highlighting Ripple‚Äôs executive team, including Brad Garlinghouse, Stuart Alderoty, and David Schwartz, he described them as disciplined and composed figures who have navigated regulatory challenges without deviation. He noted their persistence during the SEC lawsuit as evidence of the company‚Äôs stability and long-term commitment. Ripple‚Äôs Established Presence and Technological Readiness Coach JV reminded viewers that Ripple has been building since 2012 and is not in a conceptual phase. Its technology is already operational, with implementations and partnerships expanding internationally. He contrasted this with SWIFT, describing it as an older system working to adapt to modern requirements after years of maintaining legacy operations. In his view, SWIFT represents the industrial-age infrastructure that is now playing catch-up. Ripple, on the other hand, anticipated future financial demands early and spent years building the necessary framework. He reinforced that this is not a zero-sum contest, as there is room in the market for both legacy systems and emerging technologies. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Understanding the Distinction: Messaging vs. Value Movement A key point in his explanation was the functional difference between SWIFT and XRP . SWIFT, he said, is primarily a messaging system that does not move actual value. XRP, however, is designed to bridge and transfer value in real time. This distinction, according to Coach JV, eliminates the notion that SWIFT‚Äôs partnerships with other platforms pose a threat to XRP‚Äôs core utility. He drew comparisons to consumer technology, noting that multiple brands can coexist within the same industry without negating one another. His broader argument rested on the principle that the future financial ecosystem will be multifaceted. Investment Philosophy and Personal Stance Coach JV concluded by reiterating his personal investment stance. He stated plainly that XRP remains his largest holding, followed by Bitcoin . He emphasized that his investment decisions are not driven by hype or social media commentary, but rather by discipline, logic, and consistent performance over time. For him, the true value lies in companies and technologies that demonstrate steadfast commitment to their mission.

As the crypto world evolves, understanding which coins might ride this wave of growth becomes crucial. Is AVAX poised to benefit from these advancements? Dive into this analysis to uncover the factors that could drive an impressive bullish trend for AVAX in the coming years. When narratives shift and attention intensifies, strategic timing and optimal visibility are paramount. Data-centric agencies like Outset PR meticulously track both token performance and media trends. Their Outset Data Pulse offers up-to-the-minute insights into crypto media effectiveness, thereby significantly boosting the impact of PR initiatives. Avalanche (AVAX) Shows Stability with Potential for Growth Source: tradingview Avalanche (AVAX) is currently trading between $28.75 and $31.49. Despite a slight drop of around 8.5% in the past week, it has shown a solid 9% rise over the past month and a noteworthy 38% increase over the last six months. This suggests a steady long-term upward trend. If the price breaks through the nearest resistance at just under $33, it might aim for a higher target near $35.63. This could mean a potential gain of close to 15%. Support lies at $27.42, which helps cushion any downward movement. Overall, AVAX shows promise for gradual growth in the near future. PR with C-Level Clarity: Outset PR‚Äôs Proprietary Techniques Deliver Tangible Results If PR has ever felt like trying to navigate a foggy road without headlights, Outset PR brings clarity with data.

With the spotlight often on giants like Aptos and Solana, the question arises whether Sui can surpass its competitors during this market cycle. This article delves into Sui‚Äôs price movements, exploring its chances to outperform other digital assets and become a standout token. In today's fast-paced environment, timing and visibility are paramount. Data-driven agencies like Outset PR track both token movements and media trends. Their Outset Data Pulse offers up-to-the-minute insights into crypto media performance, thereby greatly improving the effectiveness of PR campaigns. Sui's Uptrend Spikes Interest Amid Minor Setbacks Source: tradingview Sui (SUI) is currently trading tight between $3.25 and $3.79. The recent price dip of about 3.5% in a week hasn't dented the excitement, as its six-month growth stood strong at nearly 47%. Sui's trajectory is promising with the nearest resistance at $4.01, suggesting a climb could be on the horizon. Surpassing the next hurdle at $4.54 could further boost its value significantly. With a relative strength index around the mid-50s, Sui isn't overbought and could still push higher. The journey upwards might see corrections, but with a foundational support at $2.94, bullish investors remain optimistic. Presenting Yourself Without Overspending: How Outset PR Optimizes PR Budgets and Delivers Tangible Results The purpose of any PR campaign is to boost brand visibility. Traditionally, this has meant securing as many publications as possible, often with unpredictable outcomes. It was difficult to know how many readers would actually see a story, leaving much of PR to guesswork. Actually, it had been guesswork until analysts of Outset PR developed Syndication Map ‚Äîa proprietary tool that identifies which outlets attract the most traffic and where a story is likely to achieve the strongest syndication lift. Senior Media Analyst Maximilian Fond√© explains: If a company needs a top list article, we filter the table for media that publish this format, cross-check costs and placement conditions, and know within minutes which outlets to pitch. Over time, that builds into a comprehensive database of crypto-friendly publishers ‚Äì something other players in the industry don't have right now. Smarter Campaigns, Lower Costs Campaigns built with Syndication Map are not about mass reach for its own sake. They are carefully crafted to serve specific goals. By narrowing the focus to the most effective outlets, Outset PR reduces unnecessary spending on low-impact publications. Another key factor is communication. Outset PR‚Äôs dedicated Media Relations team, led by Anastasia Anisimova , has earned the trust of leading outlets through professionalism and genuine relationships. Sincerity and friendliness are our core principles, earning us the trust of numerous media outlets. Unfortunately, not all agencies in our industry prioritize friendliness in their communications. Extended Reach Through Syndication Outset PR campaigns also achieve more visibility than clients initially pay for. Articles are frequently republished across aggregators and platforms such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square, extending exposure far beyond the original placement. Well-placed articles can achieve up to ten times the outreach of the original post. The case of StealthEX demonstrates this effect clearly: targeted tier-1 pitching led to 92 republications across outlets including CoinMarketCap, Binance Square, and Yahoo Finance, generating a total outreach of over 3 billion. Outset PR Sets a New Standard Pitching to a major outlet like Cointelegraph still has value, but syndication often delivers far greater reach at a lower cost. Outset PR has mastered this strategy, combining proprietary tools, strong media relations, and syndication opportunities to deliver results backed by numbers. Aptos (APT) Dances in a Volatile Market with Eyes on Growth Source: tradingview Aptos (APT) is currently trading between $4.56 and $6.01. Its price has seen a slight decrease over the past week but a healthy rise over the past month, showing a potential for growth. At its current level, APT is close to its ten-day average, suggesting stability. If it breaks past the resistance at $6.55, it could aim for the second resistance level of $7.99. That would mean a rise of over one-quarter in percentage terms from its current price zone. However, support levels lie lower, indicating the need for momentum to sustain upward movement. Aptos shows promise, but careful observation is key in this fluctuating market. Solana (SOL) Shows Long-Term Growth Amid Short-Term Fluctuations Source: tradingview Solana's current price hovers around $209 to $242. It's below a key resistance of about $256, but above strong support at roughly $190. Over the past six months, prices soared over 67%. However, there's been a dip of around 5% in the past week. The one-month change is a modest 2% rise. The relative strength indicator sits near 52, suggesting the market is neither overbought nor oversold. If Solana breaks through resistance, it may aim for the next level at about $289, which would mean a leap of around 20% from its current high end. Despite short-term ups and downs, the long-term outlook shows promise. Conclusion SUI has shown promising growth lately. It stands as a strong competitor among APT and SOL. While APT and SOL have their own strengths, SUI's performance this cycle has been notable. It has attracted attention due to its impressive market movements. If this trend continues, SUI could mark itself as a significant player in the market. The dynamics between SUI, APT, and SOL will be interesting to watch in the coming period.

53029792,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=834074,1760259059,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53029792.jpeg,UK regulator seeks transparency in crypto donations to parties,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/uk-commission-crypto-political-funding/,"The UK Electoral Commission has called for transparency on crypto-related political funding. According to reports, the first crypto donation was made to a political party in British history. However, sources claimed that it was not declared, in what many fear as a sliding doors moment in political funding. The sources claimed that the electoral commission had been given prior notice by a party believed to be Reform UK that it had received a donation made in cryptocurrency over the past few weeks. Reform UK is not the only party that has accepted crypto donations. Its leader, Nigel Farage, announced it at a Bitcoin conference in Las Vegas in the spring. The party conference, which took place in Birmingham last month, was also sponsored by several finance groups, including at least two crypto firms. UK Electoral Commission wants transparency in crypto donations reporting While the value of the donation received by Reform UK is unknown, parties are only mandated to involve the commission if they receive more than ¬£11,180 centrally. MPs, who have a low reporting threshold of ¬£2,230, are expected to declare donations on their register first. ‚ÄúAll donations above the reporting limit will be disclosed in the usual way,‚Äù a spokesperson for Reform UK said. This does not suggest that the funding was outside the window for formal declarations. Although all things point towards Reform UK not breaking any law, politicians and transparency campaigners have also sounded the alarm about the risks posed by introducing digital assets into political financing. There are also fears that the regulator has neither the skills nor the resources to properly scrutinize transactions. ‚ÄúWe are in a naive place where I don‚Äôt believe the government has properly thought about the implications of crypto in the context of political donations,‚Äù said Tom Keatinge, director of the Royal United Services Institute‚Äôs Centre for Finance and Security. ‚ÄúIs it right or appropriate to say the controls we have for pounds and pence are also the right controls for bitcoin?‚Äù Keatinge called for a moratorium on crypto donations to enable policymakers to establish whether further controls are required. Reform UK crypto payments processor Radom is based in Poland and is not a currency registered or regulated under the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). This means that the platform falls outside the regulator‚Äôs anti-money laundering supervision. Campaign groups want a ban on crypto in political funding Christopher Wilson, chief executive officer of Radom, noted that there were no requirements to take any steps in line with the FCA , but noted that they would align with the requirements laid down by the regulator once it becomes law. He also added that Reform UK was also ‚Äúresponsible for ensuring [the party‚Äôs] compliance with Electoral Commission rules.‚Äù Susan Hawley, executive director at campaign group Spotlight on Corruption, said this represents a watershed moment for political donations in the United Kingdom, which is fraught with risk. ‚ÄúIt is not clear that either political parties themselves or the Electoral Commission have the expertise and know-how to prevent anonymous crypto donations from illegal donors. It leaves the UK extremely vulnerable to interference from hostile foreign powers and even organized crime gangs,‚Äù she said. She also added that new interim rules from the electoral commission should be created to establish some safeguards, noting that the forthcoming elections bill must introduce a complete ban on crypto donations. Meanwhile, veteran Labour MP Liam Byrne is organizing a cross-party campaign to demand a total ban on crypto in political donations. ‚ÄúTo date, no political party has reported any donations that they have identified as cryptocurrency. Political parties ‚Ä¶ are required to report donations and loans over ¬£11,180 to us on a quarterly basis ‚Ä¶ We do not routinely share details of unpublished donations before quarterly publications,‚Äù a spokesperson for the Electoral Commission said.

The asset‚Äôs price is presently down by 9.45% on its weekly chart and also 12.16% away from its all-time high amidst this corrective phase. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Activity Reflects Sustained Confidence As $163K Comes In Sight ‚Äî Details Bitcoin Logs First Negative Apparent Demand Flip Since July In an X post on October 11, popular market analyst Ali Martinez shares on-chain data that shows that Bitcoin‚Äôs apparent demand has recently flipped into negative territory for the first time in three months, suggesting a short-term cooling in investors‚Äô appetite. For context, the apparent demand measures the net amount of Bitcoin being accumulated by active holders. In simpler terms, it reflects how much of the Bitcoin supply is being reactivated or moved relative to how much is newly created. A positive reading generally indicates growing market demand and accumulation, while a negative value suggests reduced appetite or selling pressure. Data from on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant shows that as of October 8, Bitcoin‚Äôs 30-day apparent demand has dropped to -13,707 BTC. This development marks the first negative reading since July, when the metric last turned red before rebounding strongly alongside Bitcoin‚Äôs summer rally. Throughout August and September, Bitcoin‚Äôs apparent demand remained firmly positive, even as prices moved between $108,000 and $122,000, suggesting steady accumulation. However, the latest data shows a sharp reversal. The drop into negative territory could mean that long-term holders have started realizing profits or that buying momentum has temporarily slowed as traders assess the macro environment. Interestingly, the macro environment has also become a growing concern for investors, as the United States and China appear poised for a renewed tariff standoff. Notably, US President Donald Trump has announced plans to impose a 100% tariff on all Chinese imports, following China‚Äôs proposal to introduce a sweeping export tax on several key goods. Given the historical reaction of market price to tariff news seen during the early days of Trump‚Äôs administration, investor sentiment may remain subdued if this trade showdown persists, with many likely adopting a cautious stance until a clearer policy direction emerges. Bitcoin Price Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $111,800, reflecting a 0.47% decline over the past 24 hours. On a monthly basis, the asset is down 3.06%, underscoring the intensity of the current corrective phase in the market.

Here‚Äôs why,https://timestabloid.com/egrag-crypto-to-xrp-holders-october-break-is-looking-promising-heres-why/,"XRP continues to hold investor interest as it consolidates within a defined ascending triangle structure, maintaining strength above a key trend line that is critical for sustaining momentum. The latest analysis from EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) presents an assessment of the asset‚Äôs potential direction heading into mid-October, with a focus on its ability to defend current support. EGRAG CRYPTO‚Äôs updated chart emphasizes a strong ascending triangle that has guided XRP‚Äôs broader movement since early 2025. The analyst reaffirmed that stability above the lower blue ascending line, positioned near $2.65, remains essential for preserving the bullish setup. He explained that ‚Äúas long as we don‚Äôt close below the lower blue ascending trend line at $2.65, we‚Äôre in a good position,‚Äù signaling that this price area serves as the dividing line between continuation and breakdown. #XRP ‚Äì October Break Is Looking Promising (Update): As long as we don‚Äôt close below the lower blue ascending trend line at $2.65, we‚Äôre in a good position! This has been explained multiple times as we revisit the lows to confirm strong support. A wicking candle isn‚Äôt my‚Ä¶ https://t.co/wbysNIcTsP pic.twitter.com/4Q3UJR78yK ‚Äî EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) October 10, 2025 Key Technical Context The technical framework presented shows an ascending triangle, often interpreted as a continuation pattern in market structure. Within this setup, XRP has repeatedly revisited its lower boundary, suggesting that market participants are testing the strength of support rather than signaling weakness. The decline to $2.71 in early September brought the asset close to the bottom of this triangle. At the time of EGRAG CRYPTO‚Äôs analysis, the asset traded at $2.75, also heading toward the triangle‚Äôs lower trendline. However, it has previously shown resilience and will likely remain within this crucial technical formation. The chart also identifies a ‚Äúpinkish square‚Äù zone between $3.13 and $3.20, where XRP has faced consistent resistance. A successful daily close above this region could confirm renewed momentum and open the path toward higher targets around $3.60. The pattern remains valid as long as XRP continues to print higher lows within the ascending formation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Complementing this trend analysis, the analyst noted that short-term candle formations could play a defining role in validating short-term sentiment. He noted that a Pin-Bar Candle or Bullish Hammer Candle would reflect stronger buying activity. Such bullish signals typically suggest that buyers have absorbed sell pressure and may be preparing for a renewed rally. Maintaining Structure and Confidence Despite recent volatility, XRP‚Äôs chart structure indicates ongoing accumulation within a controlled range. The positioning above the 200-day moving average reinforces the strength of the underlying trend, while the price continues to respect the boundaries of the ascending triangle. If XRP holds above $2.65 through the next series of daily closes, traders may interpret this as validation of ongoing bullish control. The sustainability of this structure could determine whether XRP begins forming the base for a larger upward movement into the final quarter of 2025.

CZ Makes a Statement, Deepening the Mystery",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/exclusive-was-the-latest-major-crash-actually-an-attack-on-binance-cz-makes-a-statement-deepening-the-mystery/,"The sharp decline in Bitcoin and altcoins on Friday night was thought to have begun after US President Donald Trump announced steep tariffs on China. However, recent allegations suggest that the move may actually have been an orchestrated attack on Binance. Many trading pairs on Binance experienced abnormally deep price declines compared to other exchanges. This is considered a technically challenging anomaly. An attacker allegedly exploited vulnerabilities in the BNSOL/WBETH price oracle and overleveraged positions in the USDe stablecoin, simultaneously opening a large short position on the Hyperliquid exchange. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) shared the following on the subject: ‚ÄúI'm not sure about its validity. I hope someone can verify it.‚Äù According to research shared within the crypto community, a mysterious figure known as the Hyperliquid/Hyperunit whale is behind this attack. This individual is reportedly holding over 100,000 BTC and recently sold $4.23 billion worth of BTC to acquire ETH. It's also alleged that the same address, believed to be the same individual, also opened a massive $735 million Bitcoin short position. On-chain data revealed that the individual was associated with the Ethereum address ereignis.eth, which used garrettjin.eth as its alias. This information focused investigators' attention on Garrett Jin. When Garrett Jin‚Äôs background is examined, it is seen that he founded a company called Da Yo Trading (HK) in 2012, served as the Director of Operations at the Huobi (HTX) stock exchange until 2015, and later started a venture called FuLang Medical GmbH in Germany. Related News: Legendary Author Robert Kiyosaki Gives the Red Alert - ‚ÄúIt Will Happen This Year‚Äù - Surprisingly Points to Ethereum Most notably, Jin served as CEO of the BitForex exchange between 2017 and 2020. BitForex was in the news due to accusations of volume manipulation and suffered a $57 million loss when its hot wallets were hacked in 2024. Following the incident, the exchange became inaccessible, user funds were frozen, and company employees were reportedly detained by Chinese authorities. According to research, the Bitcoin addresses used by the whale in question are linked to funds withdrawn from HTX, OKX, ViaBTC, Bixin, and Binance exchanges 7-8 years ago. This reinforces suspicions that funds linked to BitForex and Huobi are being re-moved. Garrett Jin is also reportedly the founder of the institutional staking platform XHash, which some analysts have claimed could ‚Äúlegitimize funds from questionable sources.‚Äù While the allegations remain unconfirmed, the coordinated sell-off in the crypto market that began just before Trump‚Äôs statement and the price anomalies on Binance suggest the incident may have been much more than just a market reaction. *This is not investment advice.

Traders Betting on MUTM Think So",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/can-mutuum-finance-mutm-repeat-solanas-sol-12000-gains-traders-betting-on-mutm-think-so/,"The 2021 Solana bull run from the $1.50 level to the $258 area registered nearly 12,000% returns, an expedition that‚Äôs become the ultimate reference point for what out-of-the-world altcoin growth is all about. Now, an ever-growing investor base is believing that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) possesses the potential to match, even overtake this kind of growth, specifically from where the same is from an early-stage presage angle combined with structural make-up. In Phase 6 of the presale currently, MUTM is offered for $0.035, and the presale is already experiencing vigorous movement towards sell out. What distinguishes MUTM is the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) markets-based dual lending structure, permitting liquidity pooling together with individualistic lending transactions. That is, the users have their yield generation without giving up ownership over their holdings and their leverage. That is on the premise of the protocol‚Äôs aspirational desire to incorporate mechanisms recycling some fees towards token buybacks and incentives, contributing to demand growth as the utilization expands. Institutional Interest in Solana Fueling Bullish Outlook Solana (SOL) is making the headlines all over again after one of the biggest data corporations was said to have purchased 5% of its total supply, inspiring the latest round of bullish euphoria across the market. Currently changing hands around the $220 resistance point, technicians are predicting an official breakout will propel SOL to the $1,300 level, inspiring one of the greatest bull runs this year. The union of growing institutional demand, robust network indicators, and bullish technicals has made Solana one of the most sought-after names during the Q4 2025. Meanwhile, even though Solana‚Äôs next rally may bring big returns, investors still searching for early-stage promise aren‚Äôt taking their eyes off Mutuum Finance (MUTM), an upcoming DeFi play most imagined to follow the same growth trajectory. Mutuum Finance Gains Momentum Mutuum Finance is rattling the hornet‚Äôs nest with its current presale, during which so far, the platform has managed to generate well over $17.25 million from over 16,860 investors. MUTM Phase 6 tokens are offered at $0.035 per token, reflecting increased curiosity as well as investor confidence in the token. The protocol is gearing up to launch its lending and borrowing protocol , a key step toward the development of its DeFi stack. Version 1 will be live on Sepolia Testnet during Q4 2025 with the liquidity pool, mtTokens, debt tokens, and liquidator bot. ETH as well as USDT will be compatible for lending, borrowing, and collateralizing initially, with users enjoying hassle-free, low-cost, and secure decentralized finance from the first day. Dynamic Rate of Interest and Liquidity Mechanisms Mutuum Finance uses the floating regime of interest to ensure the maximum utilization of the liquidity. It will borrow and lend during the surpluses of the liquidity as well as the low rates, but will repay and inject capital during the peak demand as well as the high rates. The fixed mechanisms are utilized while undertaking the balancing of the market‚Äôs liquidity as well as the natural settings within the market without shaking the equilibrium from the system. To realize effective risk management as well as effective pricing, Mutuum Finance deploys Chainlink oracle to gain access to up-to-date USD as well as base crypto rates like ETH, MATIC, as well as AVAX. Fallback oracle tactics, composite data feeds, together with decentralized exchange TWAPs are deployed by the platform to offer sporadic but high-quality valuations even amidst negative illiquidity cases or market tension cases. Is This $0.035 DeFi Gem the next Solana? The mythic 12,000% Solana blast of 2021 set the standard for explosive crypto growth, but speculators are putting all their bets on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the next potential 100-bagger winner. As sold during Phase 6 presale for an affordable price of only $0.035, the presale success so far by over 16,860+ investors has raised over $17.25 million, showing strong confidence from the markets. With the dual Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models, Mutuum provides deep liquidity alongside customized lending versatility, structural competitiveness shared by very few DeFi projects. Active interest rate and liquidity mechanisms are also offered by mutuum, alongside Chainlink oracles for precise on-chain pricing, alongside a token buyback and reward regime allowing sustained demand. Based on the upcoming listing on the Sepolia Testnet, Mutuum finance is well on track to re-establish the efficiency as well as the stability of decentralized finance. Bet early on Mutuum finance presale today.

By 2028, TIA could attain a maximum price of $64.46 and an average price of $56.11. In 2031, the TIA price forecast expects a maximum price of $156.88. Celestia generated significant interest before its October 2023 launch. This was largely due to the strong backing from major crypto exchanges from the outset and the intriguing technical concepts behind the Celestia modular blockchain network. In this article, we‚Äôll provide a Celestia price prediction, analyze the factors driving these projections, and explore what the Celestia modular blockchain network brings to the broader crypto landscape.

Currently, sellers are controlling the price chart as market is yet to recover from the crash. TIA price analysis 1-day chart: TIA price faces selling pressure Analyzing the daily Celestia price chart, TIA price is facing rising bearish momentum as sellers pushed the price below $1. The recent market crash triggered significant decline in the TIA price chart. The 24-hour volume declined to $20.2 million, showing a slight decrease in trading activity today. TIA is trading at $0.937, declining by over 5% in the last 24 hours. TIA/USD chart.

The SMA-14 level suggests lower volatility for the next few hours. TIA/USD 4-hour price chart: Bears aim for a hold below moving averages The 4-hour TIA price chart suggests TIA continues to experience intense volatility below $1, creating a negative sentiment on the price chart. Currently, bears aim for a strong domination as the price prepares for a hold below EMA lines. TIA/USD chart.

The hourly price chart confirms that bears are making efforts to prevent TIA prices from an immediate surge. However, if the TIA price successfully breaks above $1.033, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $1.584. If bulls cannot initiate a surge, the TIA price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.757, resulting in a correction to $0.523. Is TIA a good investment? Celestia and modular rollups enhance Ethereum ‚Äòs performance and expansion, impacting the competition among L1 public chains. Public chains like BNB Chain and Celo opt to integrate with Ethereum as L2 Rollups due to liquidity and cost advantages. Celestia‚Äôs scalability and user-friendly design make it an appealing choice for developers, offering additional scalability to the blockchain ecosystem. Why is the TIA price down today? TIA‚Äôs price is attempting to hold below $1 as buyers lost confidence, resulting in a decline below Fib channels. Will the TIA price reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment and buying demand, we might see TIA‚Äôs price touching the $100 milestone in the coming years. According to our prediction, the TIA price might hit the $100 mark in 2030. Will the TIA price reach $1,000? If the altcoin market remains robust in the coming years and Celestia develops more user-friendly utilities, its price might surpass $1K. Is TIA a good long-term investment? Yes, TIA is a good long-term investment option. As buyers‚Äô interest grows and the network expands, we might see profitable returns.¬†It is advised to do own research and conduct investment advice before investing in the volatile crypto market.

This suggests that new all-time highs for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies might occur around 2025. Considering this, along with the ongoing development of the Celestia network and the growing adoption of modular blockchain technology, the outlook appears positive for the year ahead. Based on a deep technical analysis of past TIA price data, the price of Celestia is predicted to reach a minimum level of $1, a potential maximum of $21.22, and an average trading price of $18.47 in 2025.

Reached an all-time high of $15.14 on December 24. Closed the year at $11.86. Dropped to $16.23 on March 11, 2024. Over the last few weeks in May, the price has declined below $10. However, due to Bitcoin‚Äôs robust comeback, TIA‚Äôs price recently regained the $10 mark. TIA price declined steeply following Bitcoin‚Äôs decline toward $50K in June and recent days of July.

ChatGPT‚Äôs Outlook Isn‚Äôt Good,https://cryptopotato.com/will-ripples-xrp-plunge-again-in-the-week-ahead-chatgpts-outlook-isnt-good/,"Although bitcoin and BNB marked new all-time highs in the past week, Ripple‚Äôs native token failed to recapture its recently lost momentum and posted a painful loss, especially after the Friday evening meltdown. As Uptober is almost halfway through, here‚Äôs what ChatGPT thinks could happen in the following week and whether XRP has the ability to rise above its current adverse state. Will XRP Reverse the Trend? XRP‚Äôs recent downfall is most evident in its decline in the market cap rankings. The asset held the third spot until not so long ago, but the impressive rise of BNB and USDT‚Äôs steady increase have changed the tides, and XRP is now down to the fifth. The 21% weekly drop didn‚Äôt help either. ChatGPT also acknowledged the recent performances of BNB and even BTC, both of which tapped new records in the past several days. It noted that these two have sucked the liquidity out of ‚Äúlagging‚Äù assets like XRP. It also mentioned the daily RSI sliding toward the neutral/oversold zone, which is a sign of a cooling momentum. According to OpenAI‚Äôs chatbot, XRP has already dropped by a few crucial support levels at $2.70 and $2.50. The next ones are situated at $2.20 and $2.00. In contrast, the first resistance it has to overcome to resume its bull rally is at $2.70, followed by the one at $3.00-$3.10. Overall, ChatGPT concluded that the landscape around XRP is slightly worrying. ‚ÄúTrendline: The short-term trend has turned slightly bearish after several weeks of sideways trading.‚Äù Actual Numbers The AI solution gave the best odds (45%-50%) for a bearish continuation in the week ahead, in which the asset‚Äôs price could drop gradually to $2.10, which would position it between the two major support levels mentioned above. Even if XPR doesn‚Äôt decline that much, ChatGPT sees the token remaining well below the crucial $3.00 level. The neutral/consolidation probability is set to be somewhere around 30%-35%, the AI product said. This would be possible if XRP finds solid support at $2.20 but fails to overcome the $2.70 resistance and trades between the two for the next week. The least probable scenario in the AI‚Äôs view is a bullish rebound above $3.00. It gave just a 20%-25% chance for such a surge that could propel it toward $3.30, but only if strong volume returns and a new Ripple catalyst appears.

According to reports, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the People‚Äôs Bank of China (PBoC) have agreed to formalize the Greater Bay Area Cross-Border Credit Information Sharing pilot. The pilot program, which was launched in 2024, is expected to strengthen data connectivity between Hong Kong and mainland China across the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao region. In a report by local media Caixin, Howard Lee, HKMA Deputy Chief Executive, confirmed that the program will move from trial to official operation after successful tests. Seven retail banks, including HSBC, Standard Chartered, Bank of China (Hong Kong), and three credit-reference agencies, are expected to participate. Hong Kong and China banks announce blockchain links test The system presently runs active blockchain nodes in both Hong Kong and Shenzhen, creating a two-way outlet for verified credit data. The pilot program is expected to incorporate the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Cross-Border Data Verification Platform, a system that uses blockchain technology to secure and validate data exchanges. To facilitate encrypted data transmission among institutions, one blockchain node has been set up in Hong Kong , and another has been set up in Shenzhen. Under the system, individuals and companies are allowed to obtain data from registered providers and upload it to the verification platform. An encryption algorithm is then used to generate a 64-bit hash code representing the data. The other party across the border is expected to match the code to confirm its authenticity. This enables legitimate data sharing while removing any capability for information or data to be tampered with or accessed by unauthorized parties. The structure of the platform provides compliance with privacy and data protection features that users appreciate. In addition, it also helps to maintain the integrity of information on the blockchain, especially financials. In addition, it requires manual verification, protecting data so that only people with matching codes across the border can access encrypted information. Finally, it also allows faster processing of credit data between Hong Kong and Shenzhen. HKMA announces stablecoin regulatory framework Separately, the HKMA has announced that its stablecoin regulatory framework, which was enacted on August 1, 2025, has shown considerable progress. According to the body, it had seen more than 36 companies apply for licenses, after about 77 forms expressed their interest in the framework. The first batches of approvals are likely to be received in early 2026. Applicants include banks, securities firms, payment providers, and e-commerce platforms. According to the agency, firms seeking the license must follow several guidelines, including full Know Your Customer (KYC) identification for all stablecoin transactions. This move is in line with Basel banking standards to facilitate participation by financial institutions. Standard Chartered, a participant in the Hong Kong stablecoin sandbox, has confirmed plans to apply for a license through a joint venture with Hong Kong Telecom (HKT), Animoca Brands, and Anchorpoint Financial. The HKMA spokesperson stated that the agency is expected to review all the submitted materials and conduct approvals with the Stablecoin Ordinance and relevant regulatory requirements. The HKMA mentioned that the bar has been set high and only a limited number of applicants will be granted licenses in the initial phase. The HKMA had initially asked that they fulfill all necessary conditions to apply for the licensing, listing out conditions that they must satisfy to gain approval. Meanwhile, mainland China has continued to enforce its 2021 crypto ban that was established by the PBoC in its September 24, 2021, notice. In the notice, the premier financial institution announced that all digital asset transactions were illegal. The ban ended China‚Äôs dominance in mining and exchange activities, and four years later, the country is still relying on that legal foundation, allowing only experiments through regional programs that they can monitor.

Key Takeaways: Binance will compensate verified user losses caused by technical failures during the $19B market liquidation event. The exchange faced transaction delays amid record trading volumes after Trump‚Äôs tariff threats triggered panic selling. DeFi platforms like Uniswap and Aave handled record activity without disruptions, highlighting their resilience compared to centralized exchanges. The exchange acknowledged that surging trading volumes during the selloff caused transaction errors and order delays, leaving some users unable to exit positions before being liquidated. ‚ÄúDue to significant market fluctuations and a substantial influx of users, some encountered issues with their transactions,‚Äù Yi He, Binance‚Äôs co-founder and chief customer service officer, said in a Saturday statement . Binance to Compensate Users for System Errors She urged affected users to contact customer support to file claims, adding that Binance would compensate verified losses caused by technical failures. However, Yi He clarified that losses stemming from market volatility or unrealized profits will not be covered. The exchange said it is strengthening its internal systems to handle extreme trading conditions and prevent similar breakdowns in the future. The turmoil followed US President Donald Trump‚Äôs threat to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese imports and new export restrictions on software, triggering panic across financial markets. According to CoinGlass, more than 1.6 million traders were liquidated in 24 hours, with $7 billion wiped out in a single hour. Bitcoin, which earlier in the week hit a record $125,000, plunged 16% to briefly dip below $105,000 before rebounding to around $112,000 on Saturday.

The drop follows growing criticism of his decision to militarize law enforcement. A separate HarrisX survey showed a slightly higher 46% approval, underscoring the deep partisan divide across the country. The decline comes amid an ongoing government shutdown triggered by Congress‚Äôs failure to pass spending bills by the October 1 deadline. Trump blamed Democrats, saying he would target their programs in future budget cuts. Meanwhile, on the Polymarket prediction platform, 86% of traders expect the shutdown to continue past October 15, reflecting waning confidence in Washington‚Äôs ability to compromise. Trump‚Äôs pro-crypto stance, a central theme of his 2024 campaign, is also drawing scrutiny. Senator Elizabeth Warren has warned that Trump‚Äôs crypto involvement could pose ethical risks if he profits from related ventures while in office.

According to prominent cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez, the outlook is based on ADA‚Äôs consolidation within a large symmetrical triangle pattern throughout most of 2025‚Äîa formation that typically precedes a strong directional move. In an X post on October 10, Martinez noted that ADA has consistently formed higher lows while encountering lower highs, creating pressure that is expected to resolve as the price approaches the apex of the triangle in the coming weeks. ADA price analysis chart. Source: TradingView In this scenario, $0.69 is identified as a key dip-buying opportunity before ADA begins its climb. If Cardano holds this level and breaks upward from the triangle, the forecast points first to a move toward the $0.95 zone, followed by a push past the $1.15 to $1.35 range, and ultimately toward the $1.90 to $2 region by early 2026. However, the bullish outlook depends on ADA maintaining its current structure. A decisive move below $0.69 would invalidate the pattern and potentially delay any rally. It is worth noting that ADA has been affected by the recent broader cryptocurrency market crash. ADA mirrors 2021 rally Meanwhile, insights from pseudonymous analyst STASHER , shared in an X post on October 8, show that Cardano continues to trade within a broad ascending channel but remains in a corrective phase since its 2021 peak.

Source: TradingView The analysis noted that ADA is testing the lower trendline while repeatedly failing to break above key Fibonacci resistance levels around $1.10 and $1.30. According to STASHER, while ADA offers potential for moderate gains, the current structure does not yet support a move back to its all-time high near $3. For now, the outlook suggests a measured recovery rather than a breakout, with traders urged to remain cautious.

Unlike many general-purpose projects, it focuses exclusively on lending and borrowing, tying token value directly to real usage. The presale reflects that structured approach. Phase 1 opened at $0.01, and through five completed stages the token has steadily climbed to $0.035 in Phase 6, a 250 % increase for earliest participants. More than $17.1 million has been raised, over 750 million tokens have been sold, and the holder count now exceeds 16,800. Phase 6 is already 60 % complete, and the next stage will lift the price to $0.04, with the final listing price set at $0.06. Many analysts point out that, based on current demand, a smooth transition through the remaining presale stages followed by a successful listing could see the token trade between $0.10 and $0.15 in the short term (post-listing). This projection factors in the structured price staircase and the accelerating pace at which stages are selling out, classic indicators of strengthening presale momentum. Short-Term Catalysts One of the clearest short-term catalysts is the planned beta platform launch. According to the roadmap, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) intends to roll out its beta platform at the same time the token goes live. This synchronized debut means users will be able to interact with core lending and borrowing features immediately, giving the token real utility from day one. Launching a functional product at the moment of listing also significantly increases the chances of being picked up by top-tier exchanges, which typically favor tokens with active ecosystems and demonstrable use cases. This added visibility can accelerate liquidity inflows, attract new users, and support stronger post-listing price discovery. The platform features a dual lending architecture: a Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model for pooled lending, and a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) layer for isolated lending of niche tokens. This combination allows the protocol to capture mainstream yield flows while also serving specialized markets. Borrowing rates adjust dynamically based on utilization, while stable borrowing options offer predictable costs for longer-term users. Collateralization follows strict Loan-to-Value (LTV) and liquidation parameters, with up to 75% LTV on stable assets and enhanced efficiency for correlated pairs like stablecoins. This structure ensures borrowers can maximize capital while lenders remain protected. Launching a beta platform simultaneously with token listing is rare in DeFi presales and often correlates with strong early price momentum. Many analysts believe that if the platform goes live on schedule and gains even moderate traction, MUTM could trade between $0.15 and $0.25 in the first few months after launch. Early product utility typically drives liquidity inflows, attracts exchange attention, and pushes price discovery upward. Mid-Term Catalysts As the protocol matures, mtTokens and the buy-and-distribute model become major drivers. When users deposit assets, they receive mtTokens, interest-bearing tokens that accrue yield over time, similar to how Aave‚Äôs aTokens worked in its early phase. This gives depositors a built-in incentive to supply liquidity and hold positions long-term. A portion of protocol revenue generated from lending fees is then used to buy MUTM tokens on the open market. These purchased tokens are redistributed to users who stake mtTokens in the safety module. The result is consistent buying pressure, coupled with staking rewards that align user behavior with token value appreciation. For example, when platform lending revenue grows steadily, monthly buybacks could represent a meaningful percentage of daily trading volume, creating a self-reinforcing price floor over time. Once Mutuum Finance captures even a fraction of Aave‚Äôs early-stage lending activity, many analysts consider mid-term valuations in the $0.50 ‚Äì $1.00 range to be realistic. This projection assumes increased revenue from lending activity combined with sustained staking participation, both of which generate recurring demand for MUTM on secondary markets. Long-Term Catalysts Beyond the first year, Mutuum Finance‚Äôs roadmap sets up additional long-term growth vectors. The team plans to introduce an overcollateralized stablecoin, which would deepen platform liquidity and give users a native unit of account within the protocol. Alongside this, Layer-2 integrations are planned to lower transaction costs and broaden the platform‚Äôs reach across multiple chains. Stablecoins often act as liquidity magnets, and Layer-2 expansion tends to multiply user activity by lowering operational friction. Should these milestones roll out successfully, many long-term models suggest MUTM could trade in the $1.50 ‚Äì $2.00 range over a multi-year horizon. These projections are based on comparable token trajectories from earlier DeFi cycles (such as COMP), adjusted for today‚Äôs market capitalization differences and a more competitive environment. A Rare Structured DeFi Growth Story Security and transparency remain central pillars of Mutuum Finance‚Äôs strategy. The protocol has passed a CertiK audit, scoring 90/100 on Token Scan. A $50,000 tiered bug bounty incentivizes external developers to uncover vulnerabilities early, while a $100,000 community giveaway has rewarded presale participants and expanded visibility. These measures help foster trust before the platform goes live, a key factor for sustained adoption post-launch. From a $0.01 starting price to projections as high as $2 over the long run, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out for combining clear economic mechanics with real product milestones. In the short term, the beta launch and structured presale trajectory set the stage for strong listing performance. Mid-term, mtTokens and buybacks could drive sustained buying pressure. Long-term, stablecoin issuance and Layer-2 expansion create room for outsized growth.

Key Takeaways: Securitize is in talks to go public through a $1B merger with Cantor Fitzgerald‚Äôs SPAC. Backed by BlackRock and Morgan Stanley, the firm leads the real-world asset tokenization space. A potential listing would make Securitize one of the first blockchain-native firms to go public. The deal would reportedly value Securitize at over $1 billion, marking a potential milestone for the fast-growing real-world asset (RWA) tokenization sector, Bloomberg reported , citing people familiar with the matter. Securitize Weighs Going Public but May Stay Private, Sources Say Sources told Bloomberg that talks are still ongoing and Securitize may ultimately decide to remain private. Representatives for both companies declined to comment on the discussions. If completed, the merger would make Securitize one of the few blockchain-native firms to go public via a SPAC (special-purpose acquisition company) during a period of renewed institutional interest in tokenized finance. Backed by BlackRock, Morgan Stanley, and ARK Venture Fund, Securitize operates a regulated platform that converts exposure to traditional assets, such as S&P indices, US Treasuries, and real estate, into digital tokens. Its platform also supports BlackRock‚Äôs BUIDL fund, the largest onchain U.S. Treasuries vehicle, with over $2.8 billion in tokenized assets. By comparison, the Franklin OnChain US Government Money Fund (BENJI) holds around $861 million, about a third of BUIDL‚Äôs size. 6/ From the perspective of @ThinkingCrypto1 : ‚ÄúThis is a smart investment into Securitize. Blackrock has already invested and Securitize is the firm that helped Blackrock to launch their tokenized fund called BUIDL. They are leading the charge in the Tokenization Race.‚Äù pic.twitter.com/WSxMFcffYC ‚Äî Securitize (@Securitize) October 10, 2025 Securitize is registered with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a transfer agent and holds operational licenses in parts of Europe and Japan. The company recently expanded its infrastructure by adding offramps for BUIDL and VanEck‚Äôs VBILL tokenized funds using Ripple‚Äôs RLUSD stablecoin, aiming to streamline redemptions and settlements. Cantor Equity Partners II, which raised $240 million in its May IPO, is led by Brandon Lutnick, chairman of Cantor Fitzgerald. A successful merger could position Securitize as a public leader in bridging traditional capital markets with blockchain-based financial products. Tokenized Real-World Assets May Unlock $400T TradFi Market In a recent research, Web3 digital property firm Animoca Brands said that tokenization of RWAs could unlock a $400 trillion traditional finance market. Animoca researchers Andrew Ho and Ming Ruan said the global market for private credit, treasury debt, commodities, stocks, alternative funds, and bonds represents a vast runway for growth. ‚ÄúThe estimated $400 trillion addressable TradFi market underscores the potential growth runway for RWA tokenization,‚Äù they wrote. Meanwhile, according to the 2025 Skynet RWA Security Report, the market for tokenized RWAs could grow to $16 trillion by 2030 . Tokenized U.S. Treasuries alone are projected to reach $4.2 billion this year, with short-term government bonds driving most of the activity. Institutional interest is accelerating, with major banks, asset managers, and blockchain-native firms exploring tokenization for yield and liquidity management.

The recent analysis shared by EtherNaysonaL (@EtherNaysonaL) highlights a critical juncture in XRP‚Äôs long-term price development that could determine whether the asset enters a new expansion phase. $XRP Explosion After Re-Accumulation. XRP has been strengthening in a horizontal consolidation pattern for quite some time. The $3.32 region, which was the 2017 peak, was retested on the monthly chart and rejected. This level was a significant resistance area in the past, but‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/0EtROSK9DR ‚Äî E·¥õ ú·¥á ÄN·¥ÄÍú± è·¥è…¥·¥ÄL (@EtherNasyonaL) October 10, 2025 Revisiting the 2018 Peak XRP has maintained a horizontal consolidation pattern, with price activity tightening below a significant historical resistance zone. The $3.32 level, which sits close to the 2018 peak, has re-emerged as a pivotal area. According to the analysis, this zone represents a major resistance where supply has consistently limited further upward movement. XRP has briefly tested and surpassed this level, with its most notable move occurring in July when it reached an all-time high of $3.65 . However, it has consistently failed to sustain that momentum for an extended period. Despite this rejection, the price action indicates structural maturity rather than weakness. EtherNaysonaL identified signs of re-accumulation just below the $3.32 barrier, suggesting that buyers could be absorbing supply in preparation for a breakout. This accumulation often precedes large directional moves when key resistance levels are challenged multiple times without breaking down supports. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Support Structure and Market Confirmation EtherNaysonaL marked the $1.99 zone as a major support level. He emphasized that maintaining strength above this level would confirm a sustained bullish reversal within the current structure. This support area coincides with the breakout zone from previous market cycles, backing its importance as a defensive point for the ongoing trend. Market participants often regard the ability to remain above prior resistance as evidence of strength. In this context, the $1.99 level not only serves as a structural foundation but also provides a clear invalidation point for bullish scenarios. A monthly close above $3.32 would signal a decisive shift in market dynamics, potentially triggering a broader continuation toward higher targets. A Critical Moment for XRP The long-term momentum indicator has shifted from a prolonged decline to a neutral-to-positive position, echoing periods that preceded major XRP upswings. EtherNaysonaL stated that the momentum ‚Äúis in an area where it could move upward,‚Äù signaling early strength . XRP remains consolidated beneath the $3.32 resistance, where equilibrium between accumulation and resistance persists. If momentum continues to build, a sustained breakout could follow. As EtherNaysonaL noted, this phase ‚Äúmay signal the awakening of a giant that has been silent for a long time.‚Äù Follow us on X , Facebook , Telegram , and Google News The post XRP Explosion After Re-Accumulation: This Table Signals Awakening of a Giant appeared first on Times Tabloid .",Cryptocurrency|News|XRP|XRP Price|XRP Price Analysis,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'TimesTabloid', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",timestabloid,2025-10-12 10:02:55

Rare earths ‚Äî a group of 17 elements used in permanent-magnet motors for electric vehicles (EVs) and wind turbines, defense electronics and other high-tech gear ‚Äî occupy an outsized role in supply chains because China dominates the sector. Beijing accounts for roughly 70% of global production and about 90% of processing and refining; so licensing shifts can ripple downstream even when mining or final manufacturing happens elsewhere. In remarks published only hours ago, the MOFCOM spokesperson framed the Oct. 9 action ‚Äî taken with the General Administration of Customs ‚Äî as part of a longer effort to ‚Äúrefine‚Äù China‚Äôs export control system in line with domestic law and non-proliferation obligations. The spokesperson cited the military relevance of medium- and heavy rare earths and said partners were notified in advance through bilateral export-control dialogue mechanisms. Implementation, the ministry said, will hinge on licensing rather than prohibition. Reviews will be conducted under law, licenses will be granted where applications qualify, and Beijing is ‚Äúactively considering‚Äù facilitation measures ‚Äî including potential general licenses and license exemptions ‚Äî to promote legitimate trade. The spokesperson also said China had assessed the measures‚Äô effects ahead of time and expects the broader supply-chain impact to be ‚Äúvery limited.‚Äù The message to commercial users was explicit: compliant civilian exports ‚Äúcan get approval.‚Äù Responding to Washington ‚Äî while leaving room for talks MOFCOM also addressed President Donald Trump's comments from Oct. 10 on Truth Social about an additional 100% tariff on Chinese imports (becoming effective Nov. 1, 2025) and prospective U.S. export controls on ‚Äúcritical software.‚Äù The spokesperson called the American position a ‚Äúdouble standard,‚Äù pointing to the breadth of U.S. control lists and de minimis rules as examples of Washington‚Äôs expansive approach. At the same time, the ministry emphasized process, saying China ‚Äúdoes not want‚Äù a trade war but ‚Äúis not afraid‚Äù of one, and urging a return to established consultation channels to manage differences on a reciprocal basis. The spokesperson said China would take ‚Äúresolute measures‚Äù to protect its interests if the U.S. proceeds. Separate comments criticized U.S. port fees due to take effect Oct. 14 on certain Chinese-linked vessels. MOFCOM described those fees as unilateral and inconsistent with WTO rules and bilateral agreements. China, the ministry said, will levy special port fees on U.S.-linked vessels under domestic regulations ‚Äî characterizing the step as a defensive countermeasure aimed at safeguarding the rights of Chinese companies and maintaining fair competition in shipping.

XRP‚Äôs sharp decline over 24 hours gave renewed attention to one of those patterns after veteran market analyst Peter Brandt reaffirmed his bearish stance on the digital asset. Brandt, known for his decades of market experience and use of classical charting principles, recently shared a post showing an updated XRP chart. The image showed a descending triangle pattern, which is typically viewed as a continuation pattern that signals downside risk when prices fail to hold support. That statement followed his earlier observation that he would short XRP due to the formation of the descending triangle. Since then, the market has moved in line with that analysis. XRP fell more than 13% within the last day, trading near $2.42 at the time of writing, and Brandt called out members of the XRP community who attacked him after he shared his initial analysis.

We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The daily chart, marked by descending highs and stable lows, indicated waning momentum over several weeks. Moving averages reflected a gradual loss of short-term strength, and the price recently slipped under both the 8-day and 18-day averages. XRP has also seen a volume uptrend. It surged almost 280% within 24 hours, signaling strong selling pressure. XRP also hit a low point of $1.9, dipping below $2 for the first time since June . While it has recovered slightly, the overall trend mirrors the downturn faced by the entire crypto market, suggesting the digital asset might have a difficult time regaining these losses. Looking Ahead for XRP Following the breakdown, XRP will likely need to reclaim the $2.69 to $2.80 range to restore bullish momentum. Until that occurs, many traders may treat recent support levels as potential resistance. Despite the pullback, long-term holders continue to monitor whether the token can maintain stability above $2.2.

According to the paper from Allameh Tabataba‚Äôi University in Tehran, Iran, AI models become cautious about taking risks when they are asked to make decisions as a woman. According to the research paper, if the same AI model is asked to think like a man, it is inclined to take decisions with a greater prospect of risks. The researchers revealed that the large language models systematically change their fundamental approach to financial risk behavior based on the gender identity they are asked to assume. The study tested AI systems from companies like OpenAI , Google, DeepSeek, and Meta. Study shows AI models are risk-averse depending on gender identity The study mentioned that the AI models were tested in several scenarios, and they dramatically shifted their risk tolerance when prompted with different gender identities. DeepSeek Reasoner and Google‚Äôs Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite showed the most visible effect, becoming more risk-averse when asked to respond as women, showing a correlation with real-life patterns where women statistically demonstrate greater caution in making financial decisions. The researcher claimed that they used a standard economics test called the Holt-Laury task. During the task, they present participants with 10 decisions between safe and riskier lottery options. As the choice progresses, the probability of winning increases for the risky option. The stage at which a participant switches from the safe bet to the risky choice reveals their risk tolerance. This means that if a participant switches early, they are prone to taking risks, and if they switch late, they are risk-averse. In the case of DeepSeek Reasoner, it consistently chose the safe option when it was told to act as a woman compared to when it was prompted to act as a man. The difference was clear, with the model showing consistency across 35 trials for each gender prompt. Gemini also showed similar patterns, though the effect varied in strength. On the other hand, OpenAI‚Äôs GPT models remained unmoved by gender prompts, maintaining a risk-neutral approach regardless of the gender they were asked to assume. Researchers say users don‚Äôt notice these changes According to the researchers, OpenAI had been working on making its models more balanced. A previous study from 2023 showed that its models exhibited clear political bias, which OpenAI appears to have addressed by now. In the new research, the models produced a 30% decrease in biased replies. The research team, led by Ali Mazyaki, mentioned that it is basically a reflection of human stereotypes. ‚ÄúThis observed deviation aligns with established patterns in human decision-making, where gender has been shown to influence risk-taking behavior, with women typically exhibiting greater risk aversion than men,‚Äù the study says. The study also examined whether AI models could play other roles beyond gender convincingly. When asked to imagine themselves as someone in power or in a disaster scenario, the models adjusted. While some adjusted their risk profiles for the context, others remained stubbornly consistent. The researchers claim that many of these behavioral patterns are not immediately obvious to users. An AI model that subtly shifts its recommendations based on gender cues in conversation could reinforce societal bias without anyone realizing it is happening.

One of the most talked-about projects in this category is Ozak AI. Priced at simply $0.012 in its presale, Ozak AI has already raised over $3.7 million and sold more than 940 million tokens, signaling strong early demand. Unlike most hype-driven projects, Ozak AI is sponsored by means of real utility, fusing artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. It has efficaciously surpassed audits with CertiK and Sherlock and is already indexed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, giving it a major visibility increase in advance of launch. With partnerships that include Perceptron and HIVE, Ozak AI is integrating AI prediction retailers, accepting trust-based data layers, and real-time on-chain intelligence‚Äîpositioning itself as a potential breakout megastar of the 2025‚Äì2026 cycle. Why Ozak AI Leads the Flip Game At $0.012 per token, Ozak AI gives buyers a completely unique early entry. A $1,000 investment could secure over 83,000 tokens. If the token reaches $1, that investment could develop to $83,000. At $5, it might leap to more than $400,000. And if it ever hits $10, early buyers might be sitting on over $800,000. What gives Ozak AI an edge over traditional meme coins is its AI-driven utility. While hype can create short-term pumps, real technological value can sustain growth over multiple cycles. That‚Äôs why whales have already started accumulating‚Äîit‚Äôs not just speculation; it‚Äôs a strategic play on the AI-meets-crypto narrative. Bitcoin Remains the Foundation of Wealth Building No list of high-upside plays would be complete without Bitcoin. As the leading digital asset, Bitcoin continues to set the pace for every bull cycle. Currently trading around $121,700, analysts expect Bitcoin to reach $150,000 or higher if market momentum continues. Bitcoin While Bitcoin doesn‚Äôt have the same explosive ROI potential as early-stage altcoins, it remains the foundation for long-term portfolio growth. Historically, has turned small investments into generational wealth for early holders‚Äîand in every cycle, it tends to be the first mover that drives capital into the broader market. A $1,000 allocation to Bitcoin may not turn into $100,000 overnight, but it can provide strong compounding upside with lower relative risk compared to smaller-cap tokens. Solana Offers Speed and Network Strength Another strong candidate for significant upside is Solana. Trading around $220, Solana has emerged as one of the strongest Layer-1 ecosystems, with its lightning-fast transactions, low fees, and thriving developer community. Analysts are eyeing a potential $500 target during the next bull run. While this isn‚Äôt a 100x opportunity like Ozak AI, Solana could still more than double or triple, making it a powerful mid-cap growth play for balanced portfolios. Its proven performance and strong network effects make it a favorite for both retail and institutional investors. Smart Allocation Creates Big Wins Turning $1,000 into $100,000 often comes down to strategic diversification. Bitcoin provides stability and credibility. Solana delivers scalability and speed. Ozak AI brings explosive upside through innovation and early-stage positioning. While no investment is risk-free, blending blue-chip strength with high-growth potential can position investors for outsized gains in the upcoming bull market. For those who missed early Bitcoin or Ethereum, Ozak AI could be that rare opportunity to get in before the crowd. With AI innovation leading the next narrative wave, it might not just join the winners‚Äîit could lead them.

Among the most promising is Ozak AI , which has garnered attention with its low entry price and significant fundraising success during its presale phase. Ozak AI combines artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, a fusion that has not only passed rigorous audits by CertiK and Sherlock but has also secured a spot on platforms like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. This visibility, coupled with strategic partnerships with Perceptron and HIVE, could position Ozak AI as a standout in the coming years. Key Players in the Future Crypto Bull Cycle Ozak AI: Pioneering the AI and Crypto Intersection Ozak AI's approach to harnessing AI for predictive analysis in crypto markets could be a game changer. Its token price, initially set at $0.012, has attracted considerable interest, suggesting potential for significant returns. Imagine the growth if the token price were to escalate to several dollars. Bitcoin as the Bedrock for Crypto Portfolios Bitcoin remains essential for any crypto investment strategy. Its resilience and potential growth continue to make it a safe harbor for investors looking to balance out the riskier propositions of new altcoins. Solana: A Strong Contender with Rapid Growth Solana, known for its fast transactions and robust network, continues to be a top choice for investors seeking growth and scalability. Its ecosystem supports a wide range of applications, indicating room for significant value appreciation in a positive market cycle. Investing in Tomorrow's Technology Today A well-rounded crypto portfolio isn't just about spreading risks; it's about positioning for the future. Ozak AI offers an early-stage opportunity that could rival historical gains seen by early Bitcoin and Ethereum investors.

Here‚Äôs why,https://timestabloid.com/black-swan-capitalist-founder-to-xrp-holders-time-will-reveal-the-fact-heres-why/,"A recent video shared on X by Black Swan Capitalist co-founder Versan Aljarrah has drawn attention to comments from Pierre Lassonde, the Canadian businessman and philanthropist known for his work in the mining and investment industries. In the video, Lassonde discusses the growing accumulation of gold by central banks and the declining share of the U.S. dollar in global reserves. His remarks suggest that a significant realignment in the world‚Äôs financial system is underway. This shift may eventually reshape how value is stored and transferred internationally, and Aljarrah believes XRP can play a major role. Pierre Lassonde just confirmed what many still don‚Äôt see, gold is returning as the world‚Äôs reserve asset, replacing the dollar‚Äôs role. The next phase is its digitization, and that‚Äôs where XRP comes in, the bridge between physical and digital value. Time will reveal the fact. pic.twitter.com/ECVFIcG85z ‚Äî Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) October 10, 2025 Central Banks Expand Gold Holdings Lassonde noted that central banks have bought around 1,200 tons of gold annually over the past three years, equal to about a third of new mine production. He said this has strengthened gold prices and reflected efforts by nations to back reserves with tangible assets. During this period, the dollar‚Äôs share of global reserves fell from about 72% to below 58%. He identified China, India, Turkey, and Poland as key participants in this shift, noting that these nations prefer to hold reserves that are not tied to another country‚Äôs debt . Lassonde explained that gold‚Äôs attraction lies in its self-contained value, as it exists independently and does not represent an obligation issued by any government. A Shift in the Monetary Landscape Beyond the move into gold, Lassonde observed that China is developing an alternative to the SWIFT payment network , designed to reduce global reliance on U.S. financial infrastructure. XRP has been positioned for years as a viable alternative, and Lassonde said this effort is gaining ‚Äútraction from countries in Africa, in India,‚Äù reflecting a shared desire for greater autonomy in international settlements. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Lassonde described this as evidence of ‚Äúa new world order,‚Äù with nations seeking to move away from systems dominated by the U.S. He added that many countries ‚Äúdon‚Äôt like to be kicked in the shin‚Äù by current policies and are responding by creating their own economic frameworks. The Bridge Between Physical and Digital Value Versan Aljarrah connected Lassonde‚Äôs observations to the growing conversation around digital assets. He wrote that ‚Äúgold is returning as the world‚Äôs reserve asset, replacing the dollar‚Äôs role,‚Äù and that the next phase is ‚Äúits digitization.‚Äù Aljarrah suggested that this transition would bring XRP into focus as the bridge between physical and digital value . As central banks accumulate gold and diversify away from the dollar, some analysts believe XRP will play a more prominent role in the infrastructure of global finance , connecting traditional reserves with tokenized value.

As of press time, XRP‚Äôs market cap stood at $143.3 billion, up from $114.8 billion a day earlier, an inflow of $28.5 billion. XRP market cap chart. Source: CoinMarketCap The recovery comes just a day after the cryptocurrency suffered an unprecedented sell-off on October 10, when the broader market faced massive liquidations . During the flash crash, XRP‚Äôs market value plunged 50% in just 30 minutes, dropping from $161 billion at 4:50 PM ET to $80 billion by 5:20 PM ET. The collapse was part of a wider $19 billion liquidation wave across the crypto sector that sent major tokens tumbling. Crypto market crash Notably, the sudden crash stemmed from the broader market sell-off sparked by President Trump‚Äôs announcement of 100% tariffs on Chinese goods and new export controls on ‚Äúcritical software,‚Äù a move that spooked global markets and pushed investors toward a risk-off stance. Bitcoin and major altcoins also plunged sharply as panic selling spread, while structural weaknesses within the crypto sector, including high leverage, unstable stablecoins, and complex lending loops centered around the USDe token, intensified the decline. The positive inflow into XRP and the wider market is part of an ongoing recovery, with some analysts maintaining that the correction is short-term and merely a pause in the broader uptrend. They note that if the SEC approves the long-awaited spot XRP exchange-traded fund ( ETF ), which has been delayed due to the ongoing government shutdown, it could open the door to significant institutional capital inflows. XRP price analysis Meanwhile, despite the rebound in market cap, XRP remains under pressure from a price perspective. At press time, the token was trading at $2.39, down over 3% in the past 24 hours and 20% lower over the past week. XRP seven-day price chart.

SHIB, the retail-focused memecoin by the masses, up until now, has thrived on hype, liquidity, and the retail fanbase‚Äôs powerful one, while, Mutuum Finance symbolizes the maturity of DeFi on Ethereum, real utility, real yield, and real innovations. Shiba Inu is also showing signs of life, with the price action consolidating around key support and whale wallets hoarding billions of tokens as the next meme rally gets underway. The spotlight is changing though. Mutuum Finance, currently worth $0.035 during Phase 6 of the presale, over 65% sold out, is surreptitiously launching a dual-lending architecture where users are able to lend and borrow simultaneously, optimizing capital efficiency across the DeFi markets. As much as SHIB is trying to spur the viral mojo, MUTM is quietly developing next gen Ethereum-based finance, something for all investors will ultimately prove the difference maker during the token battle over the top ETH-powered token during 2025. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Targets 150% Gains Shiba Inu (SHIB) is regaining pace as the on-chain indicators are bullish. Analysts are hinting at the dissolving sell pressure, where whales have been purchasing over 62 billion SHIB with consistent declining reserves on exchanges, an aged classic supply cut coupled with bulging confidence. The recovery from the recent Shibarium network hack as well as the upscaling of the multi-chain traded abilities by ShibaSwap have also instilled confidence among investors, hinting the meme goliath is getting set up for an explosion. As per crypto analyst Javon Marks, SHIB is capable of touching up to 150% potential gain targeted at $0.000032 if the pace continues. Nevertheless, even though the meme-based chain is reawakening, investors holding out for better fundamentals as well as DeFi-based innovations are increasingly getting keen on Mutuum Finance (MUTM), an upcoming token fast establishing itself the serious challenger among the expansive Ethereum ecosystem. Mutuum Finance Presale Mania Keeps on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the latest buzz in the DeFi market where presale investor interest continues to grow. The presale is currently at Phase 6 valued at $0.035 per MUTM token and has so far raised the equivalent of over $17.25 million from over 16,860 investors. With over 65% sales during Phase 6, there is quite small time for the investors to put their monies into, reflecting the skyrocketing global confidence for the future prospect for the project as well as the decentralized finance potential. The pioneer investors will have tremendous potential profit when MUTM is launched into the open market. Mutuum Finance will also unveil an Ethereum blockchain-based USD-backed stablecoin. The token is unlike the algorithmic stablecoins that crash during the length of the bear market, but over-collateralised and non-algorithmic so that during the periods where markets are fluctuating, the token is stable as well as predictable. Borrowing and Lending Protocol The platform will launch its next-gen lending and borrowing protocol , one of the most important releases for its DeFi platform. Version 1 will be rolled out on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 and will include liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, alongside a liquidator bot. The first digital currencies that will be covered for lending/borrowing, alongside collataralization will be ETH and USDT and will provide users with the secure, user-friendly, alongside multi-asset DeFi experience. Shiba Inu relies on hype, but DeFi utility is what Mutuum Finance offers. At $0.035 during Phase 6, MUTM has been able to raise over $17.25 million from over 16,860 investors. Multi-lending strategy, USD-backed stablecoin, as well as the future lending protocol, make MUTM the real Ethereum giant. Whereas SHIB is hunting the next meme explosion, Mutuum Finance is creating real value. Get into the presale for the Mutuum Finance today before the next phase is sold out.

While analysts focus on XRP and Cardano‚Äôs next moves, some are turning to MAGACOIN FINANCE as a hidden altcoin pick with bigger upside. XRP Price Prediction: Analysts Expect Strong Weekly Close XRP is bouncing back after one of the sharpest drops in months. The coin fell to $1.25 before recovering to nearly $2.40 , showing renewed strength. Analyst Patrick L. Riley said that if XRP closes the week at $3.115 , it would mark its most bullish weekly close ever. Despite a brief panic across the market triggered by tariff news from the U.S., XRP held its ground better than many coins. Analysts note that XRP‚Äôs rebound aligns with past patterns where the token recovered strongly after long periods of sideways trading. XRP also posted its highest quarterly close ever , ending Q3 at $2.846 , up 27% from the previous quarter. With historical Q4 data showing average gains of around 140%, traders believe XRP could still see a major push toward $3.65 and possibly beyond if sentiment improves. XRP Price Forecast Highlights: Current price: around $2.83 Key analyst target: $3.65 (60% upside) Highest quarterly close recorded at $2.846 Analysts say XRP ‚Äúrewards the patient‚Äù Cardano Price Prediction: Analysts Eye $2 as Hydra Upgrade Sparks Hope Cardano has held above its key level near $0.80 , despite recent market sell-offs. It slipped to $0.66 , but analysts say this correction could be a pause before a new rally. Market expert Ali Martinez believes Cardano could soon rise toward $2 if it clears the $0.9 mark. Another analyst, Dan Gambardello , agrees , adding that even if ADA dips to $0.60 , it may rebound toward $1.5 in the next phase of recovery. Cardano‚Äôs community is also focused on Hydra , a scaling upgrade that can process over 1 million transactions per second . This upgrade has lifted optimism that ADA could see fresh demand once the network reaches full capacity. Cardano Price Forecast Highlights: Current price: $0.66 Analyst targets: $1.5 to $2 Hydra upgrade boosts long-term optimism Trading volume up 400% in one day MAGACOIN FINANCE: Analyst Pick for Bigger Upside While XRP and Cardano may see up to 60% upside , analysts call MAGACOIN FINANCE a hidden gem that could climb far higher. The token trades under $0.0006 , and a realistic 6x rally could take it to $0.0236 given its small $15 million market cap . Many believe MAGACOIN FINANCE can outperform major altcoins due to its blend of meme appeal and real DeFi use cases. Analysts see it as one of the best altcoins to buy now , with the kind of early entry window that larger coins no longer offer. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Stands Out: Trades under $0.0006 with small market cap Could rally 6x to $0.0236 with moderate adoption Analyst pick for 2025‚Äôs top altcoin gainers Community-driven and transparent How Traders Can Position Now Traders watching XRP and Cardano‚Äôs recovery may also want to look beyond the large caps. MAGACOIN FINANCE offers early entry before bigger visibility hits. As XRP and ADA aim for 60%, smaller projects like MAGACOIN could deliver much more.

Bitcoin and essentially all altcoins crashed by double-digits, which led to over 1.6 million traders getting wrecked in the span of less than 24 hours. In what became a record-setting liquidation event , more than $19 billion was wrecked within this timeframe. However, the actual numbers could be a lot worse, according to multiple reports on X. People continue to speculate that large CEXes are underreporting the true liquidation data, and that a big industry name blew up. What we know for certain so far is that some altcoins crashed by up to 99.9% on Binance (such as Atom), while the majority dumped by 60%-70%, which is a lot worse than previous instances. Kris Marszalek, the CEO of Crypto.com, urged regulators to take a good look into what happened during those hours, as some exchanges failed to execute orders for up to 120 minutes at a time. He believes watchdogs need to ‚Äúconduct a thorough review of fairness of practices.‚Äù He added that these exchanges need to answer some valid questions for the millions of users who got wrecked, including: ‚ÄúWere all trades priced correctly and in line with indexes? What‚Äôs the setup for trade monitoring and AML programs? Are their internal trading teams fully Chinese-walled? $20B in liquidations, a lot of users got hurt. The job of regulatory bodies is to protect the consumers and assure market integrity.‚Äù The post Crypto.com CEO Urges Regulators to Probe Exchanges for the $19B Liquidation Massacre appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Crypto.com,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ALTCOIN|ASIA|BNB|BTC,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-10-12 11:38:05

According to the report, network activity, profitability ratios, and supply distribution reveal that the market has a deep demand base and no selling pressure is seen by long-term investors. Data shows that Bitcoin's on-chain positions remain bullish. Most of the coin is held by investors with low spending tendencies and current profits. This creates a strong backdrop for price appreciation, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2025. Small and medium-sized investors are reportedly increasing their buying, while large investors are slowing down their selling.

Digital asset trusts and spot Bitcoin ETFs now account for approximately 12.2% of total supply. This suggests that Bitcoin's integration with traditional financial markets is strengthening, creating a stable demand for strategic asset allocation. From a macroeconomic perspective, controlled inflation and a weak labor market are paving the way for policy changes from the Fed. These policies, combined with the government's productivity-focused growth targets, could create a ‚Äúpositive macro environment‚Äù for Bitcoin, according to ARK Invest. *This is not investment advice.

Key Takeaways: India‚Äôs tax authority is investigating over 400 Binance traders for allegedly evading the country‚Äôs steep crypto taxes. The probe focuses on activity from 2022 to 2025 and includes scrutiny of peer-to-peer trades. Binance, previously banned and later reinstated after paying a fine, now faces heightened regulatory pressure. The probe, led by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), targets activity between 2022-23 and 2024-25 and instructs regional offices to submit findings by October 17. India‚Äôs Crypto Tax Burden Reaches 42.7% for Top Earners, Probe Targets Evasion The traders under scrutiny allegedly avoided paying India‚Äôs steep crypto taxes, which include a 1% withholding tax on every transaction and a 30% tax on profits. When combined with surcharges and a 4% cess, the effective rate can reach 42.7% for top earners. The government has maintained its tough stance on digital assets, with Union Minister Piyush Goyal recently reaffirming India‚Äôs commitment to expanding its central bank digital currency (CBDC) while continuing to heavily tax private cryptocurrencies. Binance was banned from operating in India in late 2023, along with eight other offshore exchanges, after the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) accused them of violating the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. The company later paid a $2.25 million fine and re-entered the Indian market in August 2024 after registering as a ‚Äúreporting entity,‚Äù a move that reportedly enabled authorities to access data for the ongoing tax probe.

While cash settlements have since been discontinued, authorities believe these methods may have been used to conceal taxable income. The investigation adds to the growing regulatory challenges facing Binance, which is also handling fallout from token depegs and system failures in other markets. The exchange recently pledged to compensate affected traders, as the broader crypto industry continues to grapple with record liquidations and increased government scrutiny worldwide. 14 Sentenced to Life in India for Kidnapping Crypto Investor In August, an Indian anti-corruption court sentenced 14 men, including 11 serving and former police officers and ex-legislator Nalin Kotadiya, to life imprisonment for the 2018 kidnapping and extortion of businessman Shailesh Bhatt over his cryptocurrency holdings. The group was convicted of kidnapping, conspiracy, and corruption-related offenses by a special court in Ahmedabad. The case dates back to February 2018, when Bhatt was abducted at gunpoint by men posing as CBI officers and taken to a farmhouse near Gandhinagar. He was forced to transfer 34 Bitcoin worth around $150,000 at the time. The kidnappers also demanded an additional 176 BTC and ‚Çπ32 crore ($3.6 million), though the second ransom attempt failed when the courier grew suspicious. In the same month, India‚Äôs Enforcement Directorate (ED) raided 11 locations across cities, including Delhi, in connection with a global crypto fraud scheme. The crackdown followed FIRs filed by the CBI and Delhi Police. According to officials, the accused posed as law enforcement or tech support agents to extort money from both Indian and foreign nationals.

The development was revealed after research by cybersecurity firm McAfee. The outfit claimed that the Trojan uses GitHub repositories whenever its servers are taken down. According to the researchers, the Astaroth banking Trojan is a virus spread via phishing emails that invite victims to download a Windows (.lnk) file. After the victim downloads the file, it installs malware on the host computer. Astaroth runs in the background of the victim‚Äôs device, using keylogging to steal banking and crypto credentials. Such credentials are sent to the hackers through the Ngrok reverse proxy (an intermediary between servers). Hackers use Astaroth Trojan to steal crypto credentials One of the unique features is that Astaroth uses GitHub repositories to update its server configuration whenever its command-and-control server is taken down. This usually happens because of the intervention of cybersecurity firms or law enforcement agencies. ‚ÄúGitHub is not used to host the malware itself, but just to host a configuration that points to the bot server,‚Äù said Abhishek Karnik, Director for Threat Research and Response at McAfee. Karnik explained that the malware‚Äôs deployers are using GitHub as a resource to direct victims to updated servers, which separates the exploits from previous instances in which GitHub has been harnessed. This includes an attack vector discovered by McAfee in 2024, where the hackers inserted the Redline Stealer malware into GitHub repositories, something which has been repeated this year in the GitVenom campaign. ‚ÄúHowever, in this case, it‚Äôs not malware that is being hosted but a configuration that manages how the malware communicates with its backend infrastructure,‚Äù Karnik added. As with the GitVenom campaign, the goal of the bad actors behind Astaroth is to exfiltrate credentials that can be used to steal their victims‚Äô digital assets or to make transfers out of their bank accounts. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have data about how much money or crypto it has stolen, but it appears to be very prevalent, especially in Brazil,‚Äù said Karnik. Researchers note prevalence of malware in South America According to reports, it looks like Astaroth has been used primarily in South American countries, including Mexico, Uruguay, Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, and Chile. Other locations where it has been used are Peru, Venezuela, Paraguay, and Argentina. While the malware can also be used to target users in Portugal and Italy, it has been coded in such a way that it is not uploaded to systems in the United States or other countries where English is the major language, such as England. The malware is capable of shutting down its host system if it detects that analysis software is being operated, while it is designed to run keylogging functions if it detects that a web browser is visiting certain banking websites. These include safra.com.br, btgpactual.com, caixa.gov.br, santandernet.com.br, itau.com.br , and bancooriginal.com.br. It has also been written to target crypto domains like localbitcoins.com, bitcointrade.com.br, foxbit.com.br, etherscan.io, and metamask.io. In the face of such threats, McAfee urged users not to open attachments or links from unknown senders. In addition, it has advised them to ensure they are using up-to-date antivirus software and two-factor authentication. Kaspersky also urged users to be vigilant, especially when carrying out activities on platforms like GitHub, where codes are shared and the platform is used by millions of developers worldwide.

By 2028, the EOS price value can reach a maximum of $1.98. The EOS price in 2031 could reach a maximum possible level of $3.22 and an average forecast price of $3.10. EOS , a completely decentralized network, favors the evolution and expansion stages of other bigger decentralized applications (dApps). It offers a multitude of benefits in terms of efficiency, user empowerment, and the ability to provide various services. The EOS ecosystem has experienced a long series of developments since its initial launch in the cryptocurrency market in 2017. Since then, it has reached new highs, with the monumental $4 billion Initial Coin Offering (ICO) being its best feat. However, it still falls behind in its claim of establishing itself as an ‚ÄúEthereum Killer‚Äù, as its stability has remained questionable. Can EOS reach $10 in the near future? Let‚Äôs get into the EOS price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency EOS Token EOS Price $0.288 (+2.25%) Market Cap $459.52M Trading Volume $1.49M Circulating Supply 1.59B EOS All-time High $22.89 (Apr 29, 2018) All-time Low $0.4027 (Nov 04, 2024) 24-hour High $0.2904 24-hour Low $0.2661 EOS price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Prediction $0.290147 (0.00%) Price Volatility 10.26% 50-Day SMA $‚ÄØ0.454977 14-Day RSI 19.74 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 24 (Extreme Fear) Green Days 15/30 (50%) 200-Day SMA $‚ÄØ0.549171 EOS price analysis: EOS bulls hold on to $0.288 after falling from $0.401 TL;DR Breakdown : EOS price analysis confirmed an upward market trend toward $0.288. The altcoin gained 2.25% of its value. The EOS coin faces resistance around $0.297. As of October 12, the EOS price analysis reveals a bullish daily trend. The EOS price recovered over the past 24 hours, reaching $0.288 after a sharp decline from the key level of $0.401. Overall, the altcoin has gained 2.25% of its value today as buyers returned to the market, preventing further price depreciation. The altcoin is currently gaining value, targeting the next resistance level at $0.297. EOS 1-day price chart analysis The one-day price chart of the EOS coin confirms an increasing trend as the price moves upward. The EOS/USD pair value increased to $0.288 today. The appearance of a green candlestick on the price chart signifies a bullish trend. The distance between the Bollinger Bands defines the level of volatility. This distance is wide, leading to high volatility. Moving ahead, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance band, has shifted to $0.474. The indicator‚Äôs lower limit, which shows a broken support level, has shifted to $0.302. EOSUSD 1-day price chart. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is present in the oversold area. The indicator‚Äôs value has increased to index 22.96, and its upward curve signifies a dominance of buyers. If buying activities continue to intensify, further stability in the market can be expected. EOS/USD 4-hour price chart The four-hour price analysis of the EOS coin also shows a continuation of buying momentum at the current price level. The altcoin‚Äôs price has increased to $0.288 as bulls attempt to dominate the price action. High levels of volatility mark an increased chance of a reversal in market trends or further price appreciation on the 4-hour chart. The Bollinger Bands have diverged, hinting at a high volatility level. This high level of volatility signifies decreased market predictability. Moving forward, the upper Bollinger Band has shifted to $0.433, securing the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger Band has moved to $0.233, indicating support. EOSUSD 4-hour price chart. Source: TradingView The RSI indicator is in the oversold region. Currently at 25.30, the RSI curve is pointing sideways, confirming a slowdown in buying activities. The flattened curve on the indicator‚Äôs graph indicates pressure from the selling side of the market above the current price level. However, we can expect further appreciation if buying activities persist for a few more hours.

The EOS price analysis suggests a bullish prediction based on ongoing market events for the day. The EOS/USD pair increased to $0.288 over the past 24 hours. If buyers continue to dominate the price chart, we might see a further price increase to retest the resistance level at $0.297. On the other hand, if selling pressure returns, we might see the price fall to $0.272. Is EOS a good investment? EOS has seen more green days in the last month. The coin‚Äôs price decreased by 16% over the last year. However, the circumstances can change, and a recovery cannot be ruled out. A bullish rally may be expected in the latter part of this year (2025), potentially pushing the EOS near $1. Why is EOS up? Following the recent support around the $0.272 level on the EOS price chart, buyers gained control and took the price to $0.288. Will EOS price recover? If buyers hold the momentum around $0.726 and strongly defend further, we might see a rebound rally in the coming days. Will EOS reach $2? The highest price that EOS observed last year was $1.34 in December; EOS is striving to break this level. Suppose the broader cryptocurrency market moves in a bullish direction. In that case, EOS may also follow the price trend and is expected to reach near the $2 level by the start of 2029 if everything remains favorable. Will EOS reach $5? EOS was last seen above the $5 level in November 2021. Since then, the EOS value has plummeted significantly; however, the coin is expected to surpass $5 again after 2031, which makes it a good option to buy EOS, though accurate predictions are nearly impossible in the crypto market. Will EOS reach $10? According to the EOS price prediction, EOS may not achieve the $10 level in the next five years. It will take considerable time and significant growth in the coin‚Äôs market cap to reach $10, possibly after 2035. How high could EOS go? EOS is expected to reach a high price of $3.22 by the end of 2031, but this is not investment advice, and one should seek independent professional consultation. Is EOS a dead coin? No, EOS is not a dead coin because it still has an active community. EOS has good brand recognition, and it also experienced strong bullish sentiment in November last year, when the entire crypto market turned green. Is EOS a buy or sell? Considering its active community and ongoing development with potential future breakthroughs, EOS looks like a good buy option, despite the fact that it observed some price stagnation in the past. (Remember, this is not investment advice.) Does EOS have a good long-term Future? According to The Motley Fool, a private financial and investing advice company based in Virginia, EOS is a ‚Äúvery risky choice.‚Äù The publication says EOS‚Äôs future is uncertain, given the scandals and problems surrounding the EOS Foundation and Block‚ÄîOne blockchain company. However, the market speculates that EOS will reach above $3.22 by 2031, but the speculations can change at any time. Recent news/opinions on EOS Vaulta (formerly EOS) announced a major milestone as its Total Value Locked ( TVL ) has surged to a new all-time high of over $412 million. This figure surpasses its previous high of $397 million, set on September 26, 2025. The network had specifically highlighted that past achievement as significant because it occurred despite a broader market downturn.

EOS historic price sentiment EOS price history In 2018, the EOS ICO made history by raising a staggering $4 billion, the largest initial coin offering ever. After this success, EOS‚Äôs cryptocurrency quickly climbed into the top 5 by market cap. However, by late 2021, the price of the EOS token had fallen from $10 in June 2018 to $4.40 due to a declining user base. In 2022, EOS experienced significant price swings, as per historical data. It peaked at around $3.27, gaining significant market capitalization, and dropped to a low of about $0.81. On average, EOS traded at approximately $1.59. In 2023, EOS saw even lower prices, reaching a maximum price of $1.33. The token dipped to as low as $0.53 between August and September due to less buying of EOS tokens. On average, EOS traded at roughly $0.84 and closed the year at $0.8450. In Q1 2024, EOS‚Äôs price fluctuated between $0.65 and $1.30, with the lowest prices in January. By February and March, prices began to stabilize, averaging around $1.02‚Äã. EOS reached $1.15 on April 12, 2024, but soon declined below $1, maintaining an average price of about $0.8 throughout May. In June, EOS fell from $0.8142 to $0.5772, while July saw further loss with the token‚Äôs value decreasing to $0.4808. However, by mid-July 2024, EOS recovered back to $0.6100, and on August 23, EOS closed at $0.5566. In September 2024, EOS further dipped near the $0.4600 range, while October also observed the same pattern with prices mostly trending near the $0.450 range. Market sentiment changed in November, and a strong bullish trend was observed throughout the month, and the coin peaked at $1.36 on December 6. Following the late December correction, EOS then recovered into 2025 above the $0.766 mark in January but came down to $0.593 in February. In March, EOS dipped down to the $0.456 level, but it recovered back to the $0.85 level at the start of April, and in May, EOS was changing hands at $0.94 when the market sentiment turned bullish. In mid-July 2025, EOS recovered to $0.625. However, at the start of September, EOS fell to $0.47 after a price drop. At the start of October, EOS is trending near $0.41 as the current market sentiment is bearish.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|ICO|MARKET|TOKEN SALE|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ETH|FIAT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-12 11:53:10

Here‚Äôs How It Affects XRP ETF,https://timestabloid.com/sec-makes-fresh-filings-heres-how-it-affects-xrp-etf/,"Crypto commentator JackTheRippler (@RippleXrpie) has drawn the attention of the XRP army to a new series of filings by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. On October 10, 2025, the SEC submitted another batch of Amendment No. 3 forms related to spot XRP exchange-traded funds from issuers including Bitwise, Franklin, 21Shares, WisdomTree, Grayscale, and Canary. Several XRP ETF applications are approaching their final decision dates between October 18 and October 25, 2025 . The update comes just days before these key deadlines, fueling renewed interest among investors watching for the Commission‚Äôs next move on XRP-linked products. Unless the SEC grants an extension, these represent the final deadlines by which the Commission must either approve or reject the proposals. Market observers believe the simultaneous amendments from multiple issuers may signal progress toward a conclusion. BREAKING: The SEC filed for another batch of S-1 amendments on October 10. These amendments will be implemented for spot #XRP ETFs: Bitwise Franklin 21Shares WisdomTree Grayscale Canary pic.twitter.com/cSKrWTSqHO ‚Äî JackTheRippler ¬© (@RippleXrpie) October 11, 2025 Steps Toward Approval The SEC typically reviews several amendment rounds before final decisions on digital asset ETFs. Each update addresses staff feedback on compliance, market oversight, and custody standards. Filing new amendments near their deadlines suggests XRP ETF issuers are preparing for imminent determinations. An SEC greenlight would allow U.S. investors to gain exposure to XRP through ETFs on regulated markets. These products would track XRP‚Äôs price directly rather than through futures contracts , providing a simpler and more transparent investment vehicle. The move could mark the first time spot XRP-based ETFs trade in the U.S., bringing the asset closer to parity with Bitcoin and Ethereum, both of which already have spot ETFs in circulation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Potential Impact on XRP Approval of a spot XRP ETF could have a profound effect on the asset‚Äôs market performance. A listing would provide institutional investors with a regulated means of exposure, potentially unlocking new sources of capital that have remained on the sidelines due to regulatory uncertainty. With major asset managers such as Grayscale and WisdomTree involved, the visibility and legitimacy of XRP could increase substantially. Analysts argue that the introduction of an XRP ETF could lead to higher liquidity and narrower spreads in secondary markets, improving price stability over time. Increased participation from institutional investors could also boost trading volumes on regulated exchanges and drive greater integration between XRP and traditional financial products. For now, the market awaits the SEC‚Äôs decisions due later in October. The latest filings confirm that active discussions are ongoing.

However, here‚Äôs some good news in terms of overall development and usage, according to one of the big X channels dedicated to covering events related to Pi Network. Pi Network‚Äôs Ecosystem Grows Although it saw the light of day officially at the beginning of this year, the project had been in development for over half a decade before that. As such, it had accumulated a large user and fan base prior to its launch, which helped it gain traction at first. However, its progress stalled in the following months, but it could be on the rise once again now. The Pi Mainnet ecosystem is experiencing explosive growth! There are already 210+ live apps, with more than 23,000+ in Pi Studio gearing up to launch on the Mainnet! Final Hackathon submission deadline: Wednesday, October 15 More amazing apps are racing against time to‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/QSDI4OTO47 ‚Äî Pi News (@PiNewsMedia) October 12, 2025 Pi News reported that the number of live applications has skyrocketed to over 210, with more than 21,000 preparing for launch on the Mainnet soon. It attributed this impressive growth to the ongoing Pi Network Hackathon, which began in late August and is scheduled to be completed on October 15. The team behind the project posted a halfway point review in September, which highlighted some of the most utilized new apps that were released during the Hackathon. The event, which aims to incentivize users to develop more apps on the Pi Network Mainnet, has a prize pool of 160,000 PI tokens to be distributed to up to eight teams in the following manner: 1st Place ‚Äì 75,000 Pi 2nd Place ‚Äì 45,000 Pi 3rd Place ‚Äì 15,000 Pi Honorable Mentions (up to 5 teams) ‚Äì 5,000 Pi each PI Price Update In contrast to the Pi Network usage, the project‚Äôs native token has been in a free-fall state for months. It continues to dig new lows, and the latest came during the Friday-night meltdown when it plunged to $0.1721 (CoinGecko data). This meant that it had lost over 94% of its value since the ATH marked in late February of $2.99. Although it has bounced to just over $0.20 at press time, the future for PI seems rather grim, at least according to ChatGPT and its latest projection on the matter. Nevertheless, the unlock schedule will ease in the following weeks, which should reduce the immediate selling pressure on the asset.

Following these transactions, the price of ZEREBRO rose by over 300%, and the whale now has over $2.3 million in unrealized profits.

According to the company, USDe's reserve status is typically verified weekly by independent third-party auditors Chaos Labs, Chainlink, Llama Risk, and Harris & Trotter. However, due to the extraordinary market movements of the past 24 hours, Ethena released updated reserve proof at an unusually timely time, following community demand.

Analysts are now predicting a shocking 65x potential gain, as the coin gets ready to take market share from established giants Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), which together have a market valuation of more than $25 billion. LILPEPE could be the breakout token of 2025 and one of the top 3 cryptos to watch right now. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Meme Coin Set to Redefine the Market The Little Pepe (LILPEPE) presale has been a runaway success. Having raised $25,475,000 so far, the project‚Äôs stage 12 sold out faster than anticipated. Now, in stage 13, priced at $0.0022, LILPEPE has already more than doubled in value since its initial presale. Over 16.33 billion tokens have been sold, and CoinMarketCap has officially listed Little Pepe (LILPEPE). What truly grabs investor attention is the projection of a 65x potential price surge, which could drive LILPEPE to over $0.14 as it eats into the dominance of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. With DOGE and SHIB facing saturation, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is positioned as the next generation meme asset‚Äîone that blends humor, blockchain utility, and an expanding ecosystem. Investor confidence in Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is backed by its CertiK audit, earning a security score of 95.49%, placing it among the safest meme tokens in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Additionally, community engagement is skyrocketing. The Little Pepe (LILPEPE) mega giveaway has already drawn over 76,000 entries, covering stages 12 through 17 of the presale. Rewards include: 1st biggest buyer: 5 ETH 2nd biggest buyer: 3 ETH 3rd biggest buyer: 2 ETH Plus 15 random buyers winning 0.5 ETH each Also, holders from these stages can enter the $777k giveaway, where 10 lucky winners will each get $77,000 worth of LILPEPE. Traders who love crypto see LILPEPE as the next big meme challenger because it has actual infrastructure and a significant amount of community support. Cardano (ADA): A Technical Powerhouse on the Move Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is the most exciting crypto this October, but Cardano (ADA) is also one of the top three to watch. The ADA has increased by 14.01% this week and 6.11% this month. It is presently trading at about $0.86 as the whole market recovers. 27 out of 28 technical indicators indicate that the bulls are in charge on the daily charts. The 50-day moving average is rising, the MACD divergence is at 0.0011, and the cup-and-handle pattern all suggest that the price will soon break out above $0.95. A golden cross confirms a long-term rise, and the recent accumulation of 80 million ADA by whales in September makes the base at $0.85 even stronger. If the momentum continues, ADA may make a significant move up before the end of the year. Sui (SUI): The Quiet Performer with Steady Gains Sui (SUI) is the last of the top three cryptos to monitor, as it continues to grow and remains strong. SUI is currently trading at $3.61, up 11.10% in the past week and 8.66% this month. This is a tremendous recovery from its low of $1.93 in the middle of the year. The Aroon Up at 92% shows that buyers are in charge. This combination makes it likely that SUI will keep to up steadily through the fourth quarter of 2025. Conclusion Little Pepe (LILPEPE) stands out as the clear front-runner among the top 3 cryptos to watch this year. Its blazing presale success, verified security, and unique blend of fun and function make it the meme coin of 2025. As analysts forecast a 65x price explosion, early buyers could see remarkable gains while LILPEPE cements itself as the next big name in crypto.

While the broader meme coin craze has cooled, select Solana-based tokens continue to show strong potential. Unlike the early days of Dogecoin ( DOGE ) and Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) on Ethereum ( ETH ), Solana‚Äôs low fees and high-speed transactions have made it a prime launchpad for viral assets that attract heavy trading activity overnight. With growing expectations of a potential bull run in 2026, retail investors with as little as $100 could still capture significant upside from Solana meme coins poised for breakout growth. Dogwifhat (WIF) Dogwifhat (WIF) has become one of Solana‚Äôs most community-driven assets, fueled by humor, strong branding, and a loyal following. Unlike many meme coins that rely on inflationary supply models, WIF has a fixed supply of about 998.9 million tokens, with both mint and freeze authorities permanently revoked, ensuring no additional tokens can ever be created or frozen. This design adds transparency and scarcity, factors that could boost its value if demand rises in the next crypto rally. WIF also enjoys deep liquidity from listings on major exchanges, making it one of the most actively traded Solana tokens. However, without built-in burn or staking mechanisms, its price relies entirely on community sentiment and market speculation. With a previous all-time high near $4.86, even a recovery to half that level could yield strong returns for new investors. By press time, WIF was trading at $0.4851 having corrected by over 3% in the last 24 hours and down 38% over the past week. WIF one-week price chart.

Recent initiatives like ‚ÄúBurnmas,‚Äù which saw over 1.6 trillion BONK (worth about $50 million) permanently destroyed, highlights its deflationary strength. Beyond its meme appeal, Bonk now powers payments, NFT marketplace transactions, and DeFi staking across the Solana ecosystem.

Here‚Äôs How We Fix it.,https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/10/11/there-is-too-much-friction-in-web3-for-newcomers-here-s-how-we-fix-it,"Picture someone's first day in crypto. They heard the promises about owning their own money, accessing global markets, and participating in the new economy. They download a wallet, buy some ETH, and find an interesting app. Then it happens. ""Please switch to the Base network."" What? They Google frantically, watch a YouTube tutorial, and maybe they figure it out, maybe they don't. Most just leave, with a study finding 80% of crypto users quit blockchains within 90 days. The greatest innovation of the last decade ‚Äî the proliferation of powerful blockchains ‚Äî has inadvertently created Web3's greatest weakness: a user experience so fragmented and clumsy that it pushes away all but the most determined users. And the most glaring symptom of this failure? The humble ""Network Switch"", a feature that has become a symbol of everything holding us back. The MetaMask Years Taught Me Everything When I was at ConsenSys a decade ago, the mission was simple. Onboard the world to Ethereum through MetaMask. Back then, there was one chain available to MetaMask users. Users could just focus on the applications, the possibilities, the revolution we were building. MetaMask succeeded spectacularly as that gateway with millions of users and billions in volume. But watching its evolution revealed our industry's fundamental problem. The ""Networks"" dropdown that appeared as other chains launched wasn't a feature ‚Äî it was an admission of failure. We'd prioritized technical expansion over user comprehension. The brutal truth is that if users have to think about chains, we've already lost. Why Everyone Hates Using Crypto Want to use Ethereum assets on a Solana app today? Buckle up. First, find a bridge (good luck picking the secure, compatible, low-fee option). Connect your wallet. Approve tokens. Pay gas. Wait for confirmations. Switch networks in your wallet. Connect again. Hope nothing went wrong. Check three different block explorers to track your assets. It‚Äôs madness. We're living in the digital equivalent of the pre-Internet dark ages, when you needed to know if a service was on AOL or CompuServe and manually dial into different networks. The internet didn't win because it had better technology. It won when that complexity disappeared. Every network switch prompt costs us users, through the gas fees and how it wastes time. Every confused transaction kills adoption. Every ""wrong network"" error message pushes mainstream acceptance further away. We're not losing to traditional finance because they're better. We're losing because they're simpler. Developers Are Drowning Too Wallets get blamed, but they're just showing the mess underneath. The real disaster lives at the foundation. A founder recently told me their breaking point. ‚ÄúWe launched on Ethereum and saw real traction. Users loved it. Then we tried expanding to Solana and Sui to reach more people. Suddenly, we're learning entirely new programming languages, duct-taping chains together with sketchy bridges, maintaining three separate codebases. Six months later, we gave up on the expansion. The complexity was killing us."" This story repeats everywhere. Teams spend more time managing infrastructure than building products. Liquidity fragments across chains. Users get confused about which version to use. Innovation suffocates under operational overhead. We're forcing users to be their own travel agents in a world of incompatible airlines. Need to go from Ethereum to Solana to Arbitrum? Figure out the connections yourself. Book each leg separately. Hope your assets arrive. What we desperately need is Expedia for blockchains. Something that handles the entire journey invisibly while users focus on their destination. The Fix Already Exists The solution demands more than better wallet interfaces or smoother bridges. We need chain abstraction. We need the ability for applications to interact with any chain natively, making the underlying blockchain invisible to users. This technology exists today. Several teams are building it. Account Abstraction solutions like ZeroDev improve the wallet user experience, and cross-chain messaging solutions like Chainlink CCIP help move data from chain A to chain B. Blockchains like ZetaChain (where I‚Äôm a Core Contributor) approach it differently. From day one, they enable apps that span all major chains, including the Bitcoin network, which normally isn‚Äôt supported by cross-chain smart-contract platforms. Imagine a universal layer that securely connects to all chains, where a single smart contract manages assets like stablecoins and logic everywhere simultaneously. Users see a simple one-click action like swap native BTC for ETH, deposit stablecoins on Ethereum into a yield app on Solana, or accept payment in any token on any chain. The protocol handles all the complex cross-chain execution automatically. No popups. No switching. No anxiety about being on the ""right"" network. The infrastructure works. What's missing is admitting that our current approach has failed and committing to implementing something radically simpler. Time to Choose The crypto industry stands at a crossroads. We can keep building for ourselves, adding more chains, more bridges, more complexity, and remain a niche corner of finance. Or we can finally put users first. Remember why we started this movement? To create a better financial system. To give people control. To eliminate intermediaries. None of that matters if regular people can't use what we build. The network switch needs to become a museum piece, a relic from when we were too focused on technology to see the humans trying to use it. Every major breakthrough in computing came when complexity was hidden. From command lines to GUIs, from manual IP addresses to domain names, from desktop software to cloud services. Our moment has arrived. The technology to make blockchains invisible is here, proven, and ready. The question isn't whether we can fix Web3's user experience. The question is whether we have the courage to admit we broke it in the first place.",Opinion|Web3|Opinion,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|TECHNOLOGY|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-10-12 13:00:00

The now-defunct crypto exchange was previously embroiled in a scandal, as fraud allegations trailed the platform‚Äôs closure. In the post on X, the onchain investigator noted that the main wallet of the Hyperliquid whale , ereignis.eth, was connected to another ENS name, garrettjin.eth. The not-so-surprising aspect is that the ENS name leads directly to Jin‚Äôs verified handle on X (formerly Twitter), @GarrettBullish. ‚ÄúThe ENS name ereignis.eth (‚Äúevent‚Äù in German) confirms his link to this wallet, identifying him as the actor behind the large-scale operations on Hyperliquid/Hyperunit,‚Äù Eye wrote on X. Onchain investigator links Hyperliquid whale to Garrett Jin According to the onchain investigator, the wallet activity also matched Jin‚Äôs known business dealings, including transfers to staking contracts and addresses funded by exchanges he has had ties with in the past, including Huobi (HTX). In addition, the whale‚Äôs wallet received and sent funds that can be traced back to BitForex-related addresses and to Binance deposits used to open massive trades, including a $735 million Bitcoin short. 1/ An investigation into the alleged identity of the mysterious Hyperliquid/Hyperunit whale, who holds over 100,000 BTC. Recently, he sold over $4.23B in BTC to acquire ETH and is the same person behind the $735M BTC short order placed on the same platform. pic.twitter.com/WeNvmiYP8v ‚Äî Eye (@eyeonchains) October 11, 2025 Jin was in charge of BitForex from 2017 to 2020. The exchange was later flagged by the Japanese Financial Services Agency for operating without a license, an allegation that came after it was accused of falsifying trading volumes. Last year, BitForex lost $57 million from its hot wallets. The exchange, based in Hong Kong, halted withdrawals for three days without any reason. According to ZachXBT at the time, the transfers were processed from several hot wallets owned by the exchange. Crypto analysts divided over the validity of the investigation After the ZachXBT update, users started reporting problems with their accounts. Some mentioned that they couldn‚Äôt access their accounts, while others claimed that they could access, but nothing was showing on their dashboard. Several users shared a pop-up screen that showed they were blocked from accessing the website. Ultimately, Hong Kong‚Äôs SFC later issued a warning for suspected fraud, and users claimed millions in unrecovered funds. After BitForex collapsed, Jin founded and served in several ventures, including WaveLabs VC in 2020, TanglePay in 2021, IotaBee in 2022, before moving on to GroupFi in 2023. However, most of these projects have since become inactive. In 2024, he launched XHash.com, a platform for institutional Ethereum staking , which investigators claimed may have been used to onboard questionable funds. Since the allegations, Jin has removed XHash from his social media bio, though it remains visible on his Telegram. Meanwhile, not everyone is convinced that the Hyperliquid whale is the same person as the former BitForex CEO. Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao took to X and said, ‚ÄúNot sure of validity. Hope someone can cross-check‚Äù. Crypto analyst Quinton Fran√ßois also expressed skepticism. ‚ÄúWhy would you have an .eth name leading to your X handle in a wallet that directly connects to market manipulation wallets and wallets for other crime?‚Äù he wrote on X, adding that such a setup ‚Äúsounds way too simple to be true,‚Äù he said.

A Big Move Is Coming,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-coiling-tight-between-major-levels-a-big-move-is-coming/,"XRP is showing signs of technical compression, moving within a narrow range that could precede a significant shift in market direction. According to crypto analyst CasiTrades (@CasiTrades), the digital asset is now ‚Äú coiling tight between major levels,‚Äù with its price repeatedly finding stability near the $2.79 zone. The attached chart shows XRP testing the macro 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level around $2.79, an area that has served as a structural foundation over recent sessions. Despite brief wicks below that price, CasiTrades observed that ‚Äúevery candle close on the 1-hour and higher timeframes has continued to respect that $2.79 zone,‚Äù emphasizing the strength of this support. XRP Coiling Tight Between Major Levels! A Big Move Is Coming! XRP has officially come down to test the macro .5 Fib support at $2.79, and once again, it‚Äôs proving to be a crucial level in this structure! We saw a few small wicks below it, but every candle close on the‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/Fvk5EGHSB7 ‚Äî CasiTrades (@CasiTrades) October 10, 2025 The resilience of this level has helped maintain a technical base as XRP fluctuates between $2.79 and the nearby resistance trendline. The current consolidation has narrowed substantially since the beginning of October, suggesting that momentum could soon return to the market. The chart depicts an extended descending trendline, and the analyst noted that it connects multiple highs since the asset‚Äôs peak in July . This trendline intersects with the $2.83 area, which has become the upper boundary of this tight range. Technical Context and Fibonacci Levels CasiTrades‚Äô analysis identifies a converging structure where XRP‚Äôs recent price activity is bounded by the long-term descending trendline and horizontal support near $2.79. Fibonacci retracement levels play a central role in this setup, with the 0.618 and 0.65 retracements positioned near $2.85 and $2.84, respectively. These levels may define the immediate reaction zones for traders watching a potential breakout. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 From a technical standpoint, XRP‚Äôs behavior around these retracements often signals whether market participants favor continuation or reversal patterns. A confirmed breakout above the trendline resistance could transition the market sentiment toward a bullish phase, while sustained rejection could reinforce the consolidation range for a longer period. CasiTrades noted that if XRP gains sufficient momentum to move above $2.83 and then the $3 threshold, ‚Äúthat would be a strong signal that a wave 3 impulse might be kicking off.‚Äù The next projected targets in that scenario are $4 and $4.5. RSI and Market Readiness The two-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) is rising from the oversold region, reflecting improving momentum as XRP consolidates . This trend suggests a gradual recovery in buying strength. The analysis noted that Bitcoin‚Äôs recent correction appears complete, which could ease market pressure. With support holding at $2.79 and RSI trending higher, XRP is approaching a crucial point. CasiTrades stated, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre sitting at a major decision point on the chart.‚Äù Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

However, experts are suggesting that the price will exceed $5000 this year. This is due to positive on-chain data alongside institutional inflows. Remittix is also making the headlines with lofty ambitions of $5 and historic achievements. In the current market, tokens like RTX provide the most stable investment option. Ethereum Price Builds Momentum Toward $5000 Breakout By January Ethereum currently trades at $3,828, after a 15% dip over the past 24 hours. Analysts predict that a recovery could set the tone for the next breakout. Fundstrat is forecasting ETH to reach $5500 under the bullish case. However, ETH must hold volume and climb above resistance around $5000 to confirm bullish continuation. Again, macro risk factors and regulatory decisions may still affect how high ETH will climb by January. Remittix Targets $5 With Strong Foundations In Place When we set Remittix‚Äôs target of $5 from $0.11 against Ethereum‚Äôs $5000 projection, the scale of ambition becomes clear. Ethereum‚Äôs rally is supported by established usage and institutional flows. Remittix‚Äôs mission is narrower and more concentrated, focused on payments and remittance utility. Some investors may view Remittix‚Äôs path as higher risk but with far greater ROI potential. If Remittix achieves viral adoption, its growth curve could outpace ETH. Currently, Remittix has sold over 677 million tokens, the token price is $0.1130, and it has raised over $27.3 million. Remittix has already built strong foundations to support that narrative. The Remittix team is verified by CertiK and ranked number one among prelaunch tokens. Its wallet is in beta, with community users actively testing its features. Remittix runs a 15% USDT referral rewards program, claimable every 24 hours, and a $250,000 giveaway to boost engagement. The listing strategy is robust: BitMart listing after raising $20 million, LBank listing after raising $22 million, and a third listing currently underway. Below are key reasons Remittix is positioning itself to potentially outpace Ethereum in this cycle: Backed by working infrastructure, not vaporware Deflationary tokenomics designed for long-term growth Mass-market appeal beyond just the crypto crowd Ideal for freelancers, remitters and global earners No other altcoin is targeting this level of real-world impact Ethereum‚Äôs Rally Faces Fresh Competition From Remittix Ethereum‚Äôs push toward $5000 before January looks highly speculative. Yet Remittix‚Äôs rising profile, CertiK verification, wallet beta traction, referral engine, listing momentum, and ambitious $5 target command are drawing attention. If Remittix‚Äôs execution matches its promise, it could attract capital that might otherwise fuel Ethereum‚Äôs rally.

Kiyosaki has been one of the loudest doom-callers in the financial world for decades, and his latest comments have triggered an avalanche of comments from his X followers, who have since been tackling him. Kiyosaki calls impending economic catastrophe If Kiyosaki‚Äôs Rich Dad‚Äôs prophecy is to be believed, the ‚Äúbiggest stock market crash in history‚Äù is either already underway, imminent, or potentially escalating into a ‚ÄúGreater Depression‚Äù we can expect to be worse than the one witnessed in the 1930s. In a recent post on X, he reminded his followers about how he ‚Äúpredicted the biggest crash in world history was coming‚Äù in ‚ÄúRich Dad‚Äôs Prophecy.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat crash will happen this year,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúBaby Boom Retirements are going to be wiped out. Many boomers will be homeless or living in their kids basement. Sad.‚Äù Kiyosaki proceeded to remind them again about how he has warned everyone to invest in only ‚Äú real assets ‚Äù and not printed assets. ‚ÄúFor years I have been saying save gold, silver, Bitcoin, and recently Ethereum,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúToday I believe silver and Ethereum are the best because they are stores of value‚Ä¶but more importantly‚Ä¶.used in industry‚Ä¶.and prices are low.‚Äù He ended the post by urging readers to ‚Äústudy pros and cons and usefulness of silver and Ethereum‚Äù before investing. ‚ÄúThats how you elevate your own financial intelligence and get richer,‚Äù he concluded. Why Kiyosaki is convinced the economic crash will happen this year 2025 has only a couple of months left, but Kiyosaki is saying a crash will still happen, compounding the market‚Äôs weekend struggles. His tweet has attracted a lot of heat since it went up, as users, many of whom have probably heard him say similar things in previous years, called him out. Many users quickly reminded him in the comment section that the prophecy has yet to happen, even though he has been warning about it for years and has ramped up those warnings since the beginning of the year. President Trump‚Äôs 100% tariff announcement in retaliation for China‚Äôs escalation of rare earths supply restrictions rocked the S&P 500 and led to record levels of liquidations in crypto markets. Germany and France are also facing their own economic issues. At home, the US is facing a debt overload with credit card debt at an all-time high and a ballooning national debt crisis. There is also the endless money printing affecting savings, and Trump‚Äôs tariffs and ongoing trade wars slowing down growth in major economies. With everything going on, it would not be surprising if a crash were to occur. However, many want to hope he is wrong, while others simply refuse to consider the possibility. Either way, the result will be out by year‚Äôs end, even though Kiyosaki is unlikely to stop his doomsaying if no crash happens this year.

The buying spree came amid a sharp market downturn that wiped out hundreds of billions in crypto value . Notably, Bitcoin briefly dipped below $110,000 as panic selling swept through leveraged positions, triggering mass liquidations across exchanges. A new round of U.S.‚ÄìChina trade tensions, including a 100% tariff on Chinese tech imports , unsettled global risk sentiment and sent investors fleeing from volatile assets. The announcement sparked a broad selloff across equities, commodities, and digital assets, erasing more than $400 billion in total crypto market capitalization within days. To this end , BlackRock‚Äôs ability to post five consecutive ‚Äúgreen days‚Äù of inflows during one of the year‚Äôs worst crypto selloffs indicates a shift in investor behavior, suggesting that many are anticipating a rebound in the coming days. Bitcoin price analysis As of press time, Bitcoin was still struggling to hold the $110,000 support zone. In the past 24 hours, the cryptocurrency is down 0.5%, while over the weekly timeframe BTC had fallen more than 9%, settling at $111,918. Bitcoin seven-day price chart.

The pensioner, 71-year-old Adrian Kearney, has early-stage dementia and was left with substantial debts after being scammed by a fraudulent investment advert on Facebook. Kearney, a great-grandfather from Swansea, was tricked into giving control of his mobile phone to scammers. After assuming control, the scammers took out several loans in his name before draining his bank accounts. The Welsh pensioner claimed he told the scammers about his debilitating lung condition and arthritis, but they still encouraged him to continue, lauding his ‚Äúresilience.‚Äù After draining about ¬£58,400 from his Barclays and Monzo bank accounts, the scammer, who claimed to be from a wealth management company, stopped responding to messages. Welsh pensioner loses funds to deepfake crypto scammer Speaking about the incident, the Welsh pensioner said , ‚ÄúI was gutted, I just felt absolutely terrible. I‚Äôm not a well person; I‚Äôm a bit like death warmed up, and I just wanted to curl up and die. I was a fool, and they say a fool and his money are soon parted. I feel like this is all my fault, because I went along with it thinking I was going to be like Rockefeller.‚Äù Martin Lewis had always reiterated to his followers and the general public not to be fooled by adverts or websites featuring him. ‚ÄúSee any advert with me in, I do not talk about crypto. I do not do advertising, I do not do investing,‚Äù he said. However, the scam has left Kearney with monthly loan repayments of more than ¬£1,000 to five different lenders. The Welsh native, who had a career in forensic medicine, has now turned to National Fraud Helpline solicitors to help reclaim his cash from banks. Banks are also facing several regulatory issues related to how they safeguard their users against fraud. ‚ÄúThis is a particularly sad case of scammers exploiting someone who they knew was vulnerable. We‚Äôre now seeing AI being used in all sorts of different frauds. Scammers use Martin Lewis‚Äôs images as they know consumers respect him and will listen to his advice,‚Äù Fiona Bresnen, a solicitor at National Fraud Helpline, said. Pensioner details the modus operandi of the scammer According to Kearney, his nightmare started earlier this year after he fell victim to promises of substantial monthly returns for a modest initial outlay of ¬£200. ‚ÄúI knew about AI, but this video of Martin Lewis looked totally genuine,‚Äù he explained. He said the opportunity presented a way to generate some extra funds toward a holiday to visit friends in Thailand with his wife, Ruth. He mentioned that they sent him a link, and after clicking on it, he was contacted by someone who claimed to be a financial adviser. He said: ‚ÄúHe asked me if I had ¬£10,000, and I said ‚Äòno‚Äô,‚Äù noting that the person said he was going to get him a bank loan that he could use to purchase the digital asset and then pay back the loan within 30 days. The Welsh pensioner claimed that he was convinced by the adviser to install AnyDesk on his mobile, noting that the application gave the scammer control over his device. After gaining control, he then proceeded to take out a series of loans. The funds were transferred from his Barclays account to a Revolut account that the fraudster urged him to open. The funds soon disappeared from the account, supposedly used to purchase digital assets. ‚ÄúI was just the puppet and someone else was pulling the strings,‚Äù he added. Get seen where it counts.

The country‚Äôs semiconductor chipmakers claimed that they are not dependent on China‚Äôs rare earths, unlike the EV and electronic devices industries. Taiwan‚Äôs semiconductor industry is unlikely to face any disruption from China‚Äôs latest export restrictions on rare earths, according to a statement released by the island‚Äôs Ministry of Economic Affairs on Sunday. The ministry explained that the newly restricted elements are different from those used in chip manufacturing, so there will be no significant impact on the production of semiconductors. Taiwan‚Äôs semiconductor sector unaffected by China‚Äôs new restrictions China announced on Thursday that it was adding five more elements to the restricted rare earth list after Beijing tightened its grip on critical materials ahead of an anticipated meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump. ‚ÄúThe rare-earth elements covered by the expanded ban differ from the rare-earth items required in Taiwan‚Äôs semiconductor processes, so no significant impact on chip manufacturing is expected at this time.‚Äù Taiwan‚Äôs economy ministry stated . Elements such as neodymium and dysprosium, which are more commonly associated with magnets and electric motors, differ from the ultra-pure silicon, gallium, and other materials that are needed for chipmaking. The ministry explained that Taiwan sources most of its essential rare-earth products and derivatives from Europe, the United States, and Japan, meaning it does not depend on China. This diverse supply chain was set up on purpose to protect the Taiwanese high-tech sector from potential geopolitical risks. Taiwan is home to the world‚Äôs largest chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), which produces the majority of the world‚Äôs most advanced chips used in artificial intelligence (AI) systems, smartphones, and high-performance computing (HPC). The island‚Äôs semiconductor ecosystem, led by TSMC, is an important pillar of the global electronics supply chain. The ministry acknowledged the restrictions could disrupt other sectors. ‚ÄúChina‚Äôs latest expansion of controls could affect global supply chains for products such as electric vehicles and drones,‚Äù it said. Prolonged restrictions could potentially increase production costs for industries dependent on Chinese rare-earth exports. Beijing defends its export restrictions Earlier on Sunday, China defended its decision to expand export restrictions on rare-earth elements and related manufacturing equipment. A spokesperson for the Chinese government said the controls were introduced due to ‚Äúconcern about these metals‚Äô military applications‚Äù and the current environment of ‚Äúfrequent military conflict.‚Äù Rare earths, a group of 17 metallic elements, are vital for the production of a wide range of modern technologies, including electric vehicle motors, wind turbines, defense systems, and consumer electronics. China dominates global production, accounting for the majority of the world‚Äôs mining and processing capacity. Beijing has insisted that the restrictions are a matter of national security rather than retaliation due to trade tensions. However, industry analysts have pointed out that the announcement comes amid the ongoing dispute between Washington and Beijing, with both sides leveraging their control over technology and materials. The timing of the decision is also just ahead of the scheduled talks between leaders Xi and Trump.

For a long time, Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) ruled the space, but now a new frog-themed token is grabbing everyone‚Äôs attention. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) has not just entered the race; it has built something the old giants never had: a dedicated Layer 2 chain for meme coins. That bold move has investors speculating that early buyers could see gains of up to 10,000% from presale levels, thanks to its zero market cap and fast-growing ecosystem. A Layer 2 Built for Meme Coins What sets Little Pepe apart is that it is not just another meme riding on hype. It is building a Layer 2 network designed specifically for meme coin trading. This means lower transaction costs and faster swaps, which solves a real frustration for traders who felt priced out during Ethereum congestion or slowed down on DOGE‚Äôs old chain. The team has added sniper bot resistance to prevent whales from monopolizing supply at launch, ensuring a fair playing field for smaller buyers. LILPEPE operates on a zero-tax system, allowing everyone to buy or sell without incurring additional fees. It has also been checked and approved by Certik, adding more trust and credibility to the project. Presale Momentum and Price Growth The presale story alone shows why this token has grabbed attention. LILPEPE is in Stage 13 at $0.0022, with 94.77% of tokens already sold out, having raised $26.79 million of its $28.77 million goal. Stage 12 closed at $0.0021, indicating that buyers are already up about 5%. There are 19 stages in total, and the projected listing price is $0.0030. Investors entering at Stage 13 could still see a 37% gain potential by the time it lists. The zero market cap start makes this even more attractive because every new dollar coming in has a greater impact on the price than in mature coins like SHIB or DOGE. Why SHIB and DOGE Are Fighting for Relevance SHIB and DOGE still have big communities and strong name recognition, but cracks are starting to appear. DOGE has barely updated its tech in years and still runs on its old chain, which slows down when traffic spikes. SHIB launched Shibarium to improve speed, but its token burns are too small to make a significant impact on its massive supply. Both coins now cost more to use and move more slowly when the network gets busy, making them less handy for everyday trading. They were once loved for their memes and loyal fans, but today‚Äôs investors want faster tech and real usefulness. That is why they are losing ground while LILPEPE keeps climbing. A Smart Bet for the Meme Future What gives LILPEPE an edge is not just culture but credibility. Being audited by Certik reassures investors in a space that has seen its share of scams. Its zero tax policy helps whales and retail investors trade more freely. The anticipation for upcoming centralized exchange listings could bring even more liquidity and visibility to the token. Meme coins were once all about hype and humour, but Little Pepe is proving that the future belongs to projects that combine culture with infrastructure. With its Layer 2 chain, strong presale momentum, and an active, growing community, it is quickly becoming the meme coin to watch in 2025. Analysts speculate that, thanks to its zero market cap launch, Little Pepe could climb by 10,000% from its presale price if adoption continues to accelerate, though, as always, outcomes depend on execution and market sentiment. Conclusion The battle for meme coin relevance is no longer just about jokes and celebrity tweets. SHIB and DOGE still have their legacy, but Little Pepe‚Äôs strategy and fresh momentum show why many believe it is the next big leap in meme-driven finance.

The window for Stage 13 buyers is closing fast, and with a projected 37% gain at launch and potential long-term upside of 10,000%, timing could make all the difference.

However, Polygon‚Äôs Proof of Stake (PoS) chain can handle up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS) and is cheaper than chains like Arbitrum and Optimism.

In the span of just 30 minutes, the asset‚Äôs market capitalization experienced a 50% dump that pushed the metric to $80 billion by 5:20 PM ET. It was at $161 billion at 4:50 PM ET, according to the Kobeissi Letter. This was an unprecedented liquidation event: Amid the crypto crash yesterday, $XRP erased a whopping -50% of its market cap in 30 MINUTES. At 4:50 PM ET, $XRP was worth $161 billion. By 5:20 PM ET, $XRP was worth $80 billion. What happened to XRP? https://t.co/oACmCgYpc2 pic.twitter.com/fUC9U0zeI2 ‚Äî The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) October 11, 2025 What Happened to XRP? It‚Äôs worth noting that the $0.80 price tag on Binance meant that Ripple‚Äôs cross-border token had tanked to its lowest levels in a year when its rally began after the US presidential elections. However, there‚Äôs a significant discrepancy between XRP‚Äôs bottom on Binance and other exchanges, as the asset remained above $1.20 on most of the competition. Naturally, this has raised a few eyebrows in the cryptocurrency community, especially within the ever-vocal XRP Army. ERGAG CRYPTO, for once, believes this crash was ‚Äúdesigned to liquidate all XRP long positions.‚Äù The analyst went further, blaming Binance and its former CEO for the collapse, while highlighting the difference in price drops among the largest digital assets. ‚ÄúThe market collapsed in just 8 minutes, and #XRP experienced the highest percentage drop compared to #BTC and #ETH. #BTC only dropped 13% from $118K, which was a normal retracement. #ETH fell by 14-15%. That‚Äôs unusual! and #XRP from $2.65 dropped 70%.‚Äù What‚Äôs Next for XRP? Now that the dust has settled, XRP has recovered a lot of ground from the recent lows and is up to $2.40 on all exchanges. However, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez indicated that the asset might not be out of the woods yet. He posted a chart showing whether XRP‚Äôs current price is above a critical red line, which would mean a more bullish outlook. Yet, the asset‚Äôs recent correction has pushed it below that line, which he categorized as ‚Äúbearish‚Äù news for Ripple‚Äôs token. $XRP : ‚Äì Below the red line = bearish. ‚Äì Above the red line = bullish. pic.twitter.com/SHtWLEHIPF ‚Äî Ali (@ali_charts) October 12, 2025 The post What Happened to XRP as Half of Its Value Disappeared During the Crash? appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|Ripple (XRP) Price,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|BNB|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-10-12 14:02:08

Yet according to ARK Invest‚Äôs Q3 2025 Bitcoin Quarterly , the foundation beneath the market remains resilient, with bullish fundamentals, deep institutional involvement, and a macro backdrop that could set the stage for renewed upside into year-end. Bitcoin Fundamentals Stay Strong Despite Volatility ARK notes that Bitcoin closed Q3 2025 at $114,065, ending the quarter above its short-term holder cost basis of $111,933, a historically crucial bullish threshold. On-Chain Fundamentals Were Strong In The Third Quarter ‚Äì Source: ARK Invest Q3 2025 Bitcoin Quarterly The network remains structurally sound: Mining difficulty rose 21.7% in Q3 and 61% year-on-year, reaching 611 EH/s, signaling record-high network security. Miner revenue climbed 6.3% during the quarter to $52.4 million per day, up 82% year-over-year, confirming profitability recovery since the halving. Transaction volume surged 27.8% quarter-on-quarter to 103,600 BTC per day, while active entities increased 6.1% YoY, proof of consistent demand and usage. Illiquid supply (coins unlikely to move) reached 14.3 million BTC, up 4.6% YoY, suggesting growing conviction among holders. Even after the latest pullback, 94.5% of supply remains in profit, indicating that most holders are not underwater, a bullish on-chain structure rarely seen outside mid-cycle consolidations. Importantly, ARK highlights that Bitcoin‚Äôs ‚Äúsupply density‚Äù sits near 30%, the highest since 2020, meaning a large share of coins last moved within 15% of the current price. Such clustering often precedes heightened volatility, setting the stage for sharp directional moves once sentiment shifts. Institutional and ETF Demand Anchors the Market Institutional involvement continues to expand rapidly. According to ARK‚Äôs data: Public companies‚Äô digital-asset treasuries (DATs) boosted holdings by 40% in 2025, reaching 1.1 million BTC or 5.6% of total supply. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs now control 1.3 million BTC (6.6% of supply), a record high. Notably, every historical peak in ETF balances has preceded a new cycle price high. Combined, ETFs and DATs hold 12.2% of all Bitcoin, underscoring how institutional accumulation is tightening available supply. Meanwhile, derivatives data show a healthy but not overheated market. Perpetual funding rates stand near 2.1% and the three-month futures basis is around 7.6%, far below the 43% and 17% extremes seen at the 2021 peak, evidence that leverage remains contained and speculative excess is limited. Macro Trends: Inflation Eases, Productivity Rises ARK‚Äôs macro team expects that fading inflation and weakening labor momentum will push the Federal Reserve toward a dovish stance. The U.S. labor differential has turned negative for the first time since 2020, the quits rate has fallen to 1.9%, and average unemployment duration has extended to 24.5 weeks. While labor softens, price pressures are muted: Truflation‚Äôs CPI shows a sub-3% year-on-year trend, well below official readings. With tariffs having minimal inflation impact, ARK believes the Fed‚Äôs focus will pivot from inflation to employment, easing financial conditions, a backdrop historically favorable for Bitcoin. Moreover, deregulation and tax-driven investment incentives under the ‚ÄúOne Big Beautiful Bill‚Äù (OBBB) are expected to unleash a productivity boom, with permanent expensing for R&D, software, and equipment expected to lift real GDP growth in 2026. Such structural growth, ARK argues, aligns with Bitcoin‚Äôs appeal as a technological and monetary hedge. Technology and new ideas. Therefore, Bitcoin could benefit as investors search for better opportunities. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technical Outlook: Bulls Defend $108K Support From a technical lens, Bitcoin remains range-bound but stable. The $108,000‚Äì$110,000 zone aligns with the 200-day moving average and on-chain mean support at $104,772. The RSI (40.6) signals mild oversold conditions, while contracting MACD histograms suggest waning bearish pressure. If BTC breaks above $117,000, it could trigger a short-term rally toward $124,000‚Äì$126,000, retesting previous highs. Failure to defend $108,000 may expose $103,000 and $98,200, consistent with the 50% Fibonacci retracement from June‚Äôs rally. For swing traders, ARK‚Äôs data-supported structure points to a buy-the-dip opportunity near $108K, with tight risk below $107.5K and targets near $124K‚Äì$126K. Outlook: Positioned for Growth, Poised for Volatility ARK concludes that while Bitcoin‚Äôs cyclical timing suggests late-stage bull-market conditions (about 18 months post-halving), structural fundamentals remain highly constructive. Network security, institutional absorption, and moderating macro pressures provide a robust floor, though elevated supply density warns of volatility spikes ahead. In short: Bitcoin may wobble before it surges, but its long-term trajectory remains upward, fueled by record institutional ownership, tightening supply, and improving macro liquidity. As 2025 draws to a close, the next significant move could define the opening narrative for 2026. Presale Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Combines BTC Security With Solana Speed Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM).

Investors are showing signs of fear as the recent drop invalidated the breakout momentum that many expected to extend the bull run, and the market might be on the verge of a bearish shift. By Shayan The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, BTC failed to continue beyond $126K and has fallen sharply to the $100K area, before rebounding quickly. The rejection from the ATH zone, combined with the breakdown below the 100-day moving average, signals a loss of bullish momentum. The next major support sits around the $100K range, which also aligns with the trendline support and the 200-day moving average. The RSI near 41 suggests that while the market is cooling off, there‚Äôs still room for further downside if buyers don‚Äôt step in soon. The 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour chart shows that BTC found temporary support around the $110K zone after the intense sell-off. This area previously served as an accumulation zone before the last leg up, making it a critical short-term level. The RSI remains weak around 32, showing limited strength from buyers. Immediate resistance lies around $117K, where previous support flipped into resistance. A rejection from this zone could trigger another leg down, possibly toward the $105k region, which aligns with the lower boundary of the large ascending channel. A breakdown of this channel would likely end the bull market, and Bitcoin would enter a long-term downtrend alongside the whole crypto market. Sentiment Analysis Long Liquidations (7-day MA) The liquidation chart highlights a massive spike in long liquidations, the largest one ever, coinciding with Bitcoin‚Äôs failure to set a new high. This cascade has forced overleveraged traders out of the market and significantly reduced open interest. Historically, such liquidation flushes often mark short-term bottoms, but given the fragile sentiment, investors remain hesitant to re-enter aggressively. The market‚Äôs fear-driven tone suggests that while a relief bounce is possible, confidence in the uptrend has clearly weakened. This could be the beginning of the end for this cycle‚Äôs bullish market, especially if the price closes below $100K.

The sudden shift comes just as the first spot XRP exchange-traded fund applications near their decision dates, adding pressure to an already volatile environment. Amelie, a prominent crypto commentator known on X as @_Crypto_Barbie, highlighted the approaching deadlines by sharing an image listing decision dates for several major issuers set between October 18 and October 25, 2025. Her post circulated widely among XRP investors, who noted that the timing of the downturn correlates with the moment of ETF decisions. Several of the industry‚Äôs largest asset managers, including Grayscale, 21Shares, Bitwise, Canary Capital, WisdomTree, Franklin Templeton, and CoinShares, are awaiting responses from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) during that period. Their filings collectively represent the first concerted effort to launch regulated spot XRP products in the U.S. Look what is about to begin next week Weird timing for a complete market crash, isn‚Äôt it? pic.twitter.com/of6weDkvtP ‚Äî ùìêùì∂ùìÆùìµùì≤ùìÆ (@_Crypto_Barbie) October 10, 2025 The Road to Approval The prospect of a spot XRP ETF has circulated in trading circles for months, but the timeline is now clearer. In September, the SEC approved updated listing rules designed to streamline the process for spot crypto ETFs. The change enables exchanges to apply under general standards, dismissing the need for dual filings that previously slowed down approval. While they do not ensure approval, Market observers believe these adjustments create a clearer regulatory route. Each issuer must still demonstrate adequate safeguards against market manipulation and prove compliance with custody and liquidity requirements. Market Reaction to Recent Volatility XRP‚Äôs price fell below $2 for the first time since June during the week‚Äôs sell-off, reflecting the wider correction seen across digital assets. Despite the decline, investor engagement with XRP remains high. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Trading activity surged during the downturn, suggesting that long-term holders view the price movement as situational rather than structural. Analysts attribute much of the weakness to external market factors, including macroeconomic pressure and ongoing liquidation across leveraged crypto positions. Bitcoin and Ethereum also experienced steep declines during the same period, reinforcing the view that the pullback reflects sector-wide risk aversion rather than asset-specific weakness. Still, XRP‚Äôs movement stood out given its proximity to potentially market-altering regulatory decisions. Anticipation Builds for Key Decisions The concentration of ETF decision dates within a single week has intensified speculation about how the SEC will approach XRP‚Äôs classification under the newly adopted framework. Approval of even one application could set a precedent for other altcoin-based ETFs and would likely reshape institutional engagement with XRP.

The drop followed fresh talk of Trump tariffs and a possible China trade war. That news shock hit tokens and raised the odds of more volatility. Amid this pressure, Remittix (RTX) is emerging as a payments-based alternative with real use. This article explores the bear case for Pi, then explains why Remittix could be the steadier option for investors who want utility over hype. Analysts Warn Pi Coin Price Could Crash To $0 By 2026 Roughly half of surveyed analysts now think Pi could be worth $0 by 2026. They cite structural issues, thin liquidity, and weak adoption. The biggest near-term risk is the large token unlock. Also, yesterday‚Äôs crash showed how fragile the market is, and if tariff headlines keep cycling and a trade dispute escalates, volatility may stay high. The upcoming Protocol 23 upgrade may help with mechanics, but it cannot fix a weak economic base on its own. Remittix Gains Momentum With Real Utility And Exchange Listings Pi faces systemic risk from oversupply and speculative dependence. Remittix, on the other hand, is built around real payment infrastructure and a cross-border transfer utility, offering a practical foundation for long-term value. Importantly, the Remittix presale acted as a hedge during yesterday‚Äôs crash, and investors‚Äô allocations were not affected by the price swings. As capital exits highly speculative projects, some investors are turning to tokens like Remittix that are tied to actual use cases. Remittix has secured listings on BitMart (after raising $20 million) and LBank (after $22 million), with a third CEX listing currently in preparation. Remittix has sold over 677 million tokens, priced at $0.1130, and raised more than $27.3 million in total. The Remittix team is verified by CertiK, and it ranks #1 among pre-launch tokens. Its wallet is in beta testing, with community users actively evaluating live features. Remittix operates a 15% USDT referral program claimable every 24 hours, alongside a $250,000 giveaway to encourage user growth. The following features underline why Remittix stands apart: Backed by working infrastructure, not vaporware Deflationary tokenomics designed for long-term growth Mass-market appeal beyond just the crypto crowd Ideal for freelancers, remitters, and global earners No other altcoin is targeting this level of real-world impact Why Remittix Might Steal the Meme-Coin Spotlight With half of analysts warning that Pi Coin could crash to $0, the risks are clear. Remittix, by contrast, has shown the opposite, as it kept investments steady through the crash due to its presale structure. With more than $27.3 million raised, Remittix looks like a project that can attract capital even when markets chop. For investors watching the horizon for the best token of 2026, Remittix is a credible project with breakout potential. In a market where tariffs and trade news can flip the tape in minutes, that build-first stance‚Äîand a presale that resists volatility‚Äîcan make all the difference.

The crypto market saw over $19 billion of leveraged positions liquidated within 24 hours starting Friday, October 10, marking the largest liquidation event in the market. The capitulation event was reportedly sparked by President Trump‚Äôs renewed tariff war with China. Schiff, the Chief Economist and Global Strategist at Euro Pacific Capital, warned that the market‚Äôs recent downturn could nosedive further, sending Bitcoin as low as $75,000 and Ethereum crashing to $1,500. ‚ÄúCrypto carnage continues,‚Äù Schiff wrote . ‚ÄúBitcoin is below $110,000, and Ether is below $3,700. If Ether cracks $3,350, it could crash to $1,500, nearly 70% below its record high. If that happens, Bitcoin could sink to about $75K, a 40% drop from its peak, wiping out all of $MSTR‚Äôs paper gains.‚Äù Schiff continues to attack Saylor‚Äôs Strategy Much of Schiff‚Äôs warning focused on Michael Saylor‚Äôs company, Strategy, whose balance sheet is heavily exposed to Bitcoin. The firm holds over 640,031 BTC, worth more than $71 billion as of the time of writing, making it the largest corporate holder of the digital asset. Saylor‚Äôs Bitcoin accumulation strategy, financed through convertible notes and equity offerings, has made him one of the most visible evangelists of ‚Äúdigital gold‚Äù. However, it has also tied the company‚Äôs fortunes closely to Bitcoin‚Äôs price swings. Should Schiff‚Äôs rhetoric about the possibility of BTC heading toward $75,000 come to pass, it would erase Strategy‚Äôs ‚Äúpaper gains‚Äù as he predicted, and reignite debate over the sustainability of its leveraged approach. Saylor, for his part, has continued to defend the firm‚Äôs accumulation policy. Late last month, he said that Strategy‚Äôs endgame is to accumulate $1 trillion worth of Bitcoin, dismissing his critics by saying that each price milestone brings new skeptics, yet adoption continues to grow. More bearish predictions for Ethereum Ethereum, meanwhile, has also come under pressure, with Schiff claiming that a break below $3,350 could trigger a major selloff. ‚ÄúAs bad as Bitcoin looks, Ethereum looks even worse. While Bitcoin is only down about 10% from its record high, Ether is down 21%. It‚Äôs now trading near $3,900. If it breaks support around $3,350, a quick move down to $1,500 is a real risk. Get out now!, he wrote in a post on X. Not all observers agree with Schiff‚Äôs dire forecast. Some market strategists argue that even if Ethereum briefly breaches $3,350, strong on-chain fundamentals, including rising staking participation and increased participation of institutional investors such as Bitmine, which used the fall as an opportunity to acquire more ETH, could limit downside pressure. The veteran gold fund manager, who has spent years predicting the collapse of what he calls ‚Äúthe Bitcoin bubble,‚Äù has been one of the few consistent bears through multiple market cycles. However, it‚Äôs worth noting that many of his earlier predictions have failed to materialize. Schiff‚Äôs $75,000 Bitcoin target remains a minority view, but one that reflects growing caution across digital assets. If that reality involves a break below key support levels, the next few weeks could test the faith of even the market‚Äôs most hardened believers. Market players like Tom Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat and chairman of BitMine, say that the current drop is a buying opportunity rather than a harbinger for a prolonged market crisis.

But the airdrop isn‚Äôt about traders or liquidity. Instead, it is about shareholder value and sustainable engagement, according to Messari‚Äôs AJC. BASE Token Airdrop AJC‚Äôs analysis centers on an important factor. For the first time, a publicly traded company, Coinbase, will be behind a token generation event (TGE). This structural distinction, he argues , changes everything about the game theory of token distribution, incentives, and long-term value creation. Typically, TGEs and airdrops serve as liquidity events for venture investors and team members, and are designed to maximize the token‚Äôs market debut. These launches often focus on short-term price gains and exchange listings, sometimes at the expense of sustainable ecosystem growth. But AJC suggests that this model does not apply to Base. Since Coinbase‚Äôs shareholders are the ultimate stakeholders, any issuance of BASE must be justified by how it improves shareholder value, not just token value. The logic behind BASE‚Äôs distribution is not about rewarding early adopters or driving speculative hype; it‚Äôs about advancing Coinbase‚Äôs corporate interests. That insight reframes the entire purpose of a potential airdrop. Instead of functioning primarily as a reward mechanism for users, the BASE airdrop would act as a strategic tool to increase the overall worth of Coinbase‚Äôs equity. Pleasing Both Shareholders and Users The challenge, AJC says, lies in designing an allocation model that satisfies both shareholders and community participants. The ideal solution would boost Coinbase‚Äôs long-term value while at the same time incentivizing meaningful user engagement within the Base ecosystem. In that context, AJC believes the most valuable user actions won‚Äôt be the typical on-chain performance metrics like total value locked (TVL), transaction volume, or trading activity. Base already leads many of its Layer 2 peers across those categories. Instead, Coinbase‚Äôs real opportunity lies in boosting ‚Äúsocial and consumer experiences.‚Äù This includes activities that drive stickiness, organic adoption, and network effects. Actions such as experimenting with creator coins, using the Base app, or participating in community-facing projects could better align with Coinbase‚Äôs goals. These are the behaviors that create durable, non-mercenary growth. ‚ÄúUltimately, the shareholder dynamic completely reshapes how a TGE or airdrop should be designed, and understanding that is key to positioning yourself for the BASE launch.‚Äù The post Coinbase‚Äôs Upcoming BASE Token Isn‚Äôt Just Another Airdrop ‚Äì It‚Äôs a Shareholder Strategy in Disguise appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Airdrops|Base|Coinbase,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|CRYPTOCURRENCY|AIRDROP|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-10-12 14:25:21

According to The Korea Daily, the agency announced that cold wallets will also be subject to search and seizure. The tax agency stated that it uses blockchain analysis tools to track on-chain transactions and will seize hard drives or cold wallets if it suspects crypto assets are being stored offline. Over the past four years, the agency has seized and liquidated crypto assets totaling ‚Ç©146.1 billion (approximately $108 million) from 14,140 taxpayers. Tax evasion cases are reportedly increasing with the proliferation of cryptocurrencies. The anonymous nature of virtual assets makes identifying their owners much more difficult than other financial assets like deposits or stocks. Therefore, NTS plans to deploy specialized tracking software to prevent attempts to hide assets. According to official data, the number of virtual asset investors in South Korea has increased nearly tenfold in the last five years, from 1.2 million to 10.77 million. Average daily trading volume has reached approximately $4.5 billion, demonstrating that cryptocurrencies have become a popular investment tool. Related News: Legendary Author Robert Kiyosaki Gives the Red Alert - ‚ÄúIt Will Happen This Year‚Äù - Surprisingly Points to Ethereum The use of crypto assets in tax collection began in 2021. That year, the NTS seized the crypto assets of 5,741 high-income tax debtors, collecting a total of approximately $50 million. The process begins with the tax office inquiring about the tax debtor's accounts on exchanges. If crypto accounts belonging to the tax debtor are identified, the exchange freezes the account, and the NTS seizes the assets and sells them at market price to collect the debt. However, some debtors choose to evade oversight by moving their assets to offshore exchanges. South Korea shares information with 74 countries under a multilateral tax cooperation agreement, but the US, China, and Russia remain outside this agreement. According to the Financial Supervisory Service, the amount of crypto transferred from domestic exchanges to offshore platforms or individual wallets reached approximately $55 billion in the first half of 2025. Tax evaders store their assets in ‚Äúcold wallets,‚Äù further complicating audits. Cold wallets are hard drives or hardware wallets that are not connected to the internet. Cryptocurrency stored in these devices, like cash or gold, is extremely difficult to identify. *This is not investment advice.

The market‚Äôs uncertainty comes just as financial author Robert Kiyosaki issues one of his most urgent warnings yet, calling for what he describes as the biggest crash in world history and signaling renewed faith in Ethereum and silver as protection against currency devaluation. REMINDER: I predicted the biggest crash in world history was coming in my book Rich Dad‚Äôs Prophecy. That crash will happen this year. Baby Boom Retirements are going to be wiped out. Many boomers will be homeless or living in their kids basement. Sad. REMiNDER: I have‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) October 11, 2025 Kiyosaki Bets on Real Assets Amid Dollar Weakness In a series of posts on X , the author of Rich Dad Poor Dad cautioned that a global financial reset could wipe out the savings of millions of retirees. He urged followers to avoid ‚Äúprinted assets‚Äù and move toward tangible value, writing: ‚ÄúInflation turns savers‚Äô cash into trash.‚Äù While Kiyosaki has long supported gold, silver, and bitcoin, his recent comments highlight a growing conviction in Ethereum‚Äôs dual role as both a store of value and a practical asset within the digital economy. ‚ÄúToday, I believe silver and Ethereum are the best because they are stores of value, but more importantly, used in industry, and prices are low,‚Äù he said. Earlier this week, he called silver and Ethereum ‚Äúhot, hot, hot,‚Äù suggesting both could see explosive upside once investors begin shifting from fiat-based assets. He believes the next phase of wealth preservation will favor scarce, productive assets, whether that‚Äôs physical metal or programmable money. ETH Technical Outlook: Range Before the Rebound On the technical front, Ethereum price prediction appears bearish, as BTC consolidates in a sideways range between $3,720 and $3,860, holding above the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $3,719, which has acted as near-term support. The RSI at 39 suggests oversold conditions, hinting that sellers may be losing control. Despite trading below its 100-period moving average (around $4,270), the broader structure shows signs of a descending trendline compression, often preceding a reversal. Bitcoin Price Chart ‚Äì Source: Tradingview The 61.8% Fibonacci level at $4,055 forms a significant resistance zone; a breakout above it could confirm a bullish reversal toward $4,200‚Äì$4,330, areas where Ethereum last consolidated before its September drop. If, however, ETH slips below $3,720, bears could test $3,512, the base of the prior rally. For traders, a potential buy-the-dip setup near $3,720‚Äì$3,760 offers a favorable risk-reward profile, with targets at $3,950‚Äì$4,200 and stops below $3,680. Macro Risks Meet Digital Opportunity Kiyosaki‚Äôs warning about a weakening dollar mirrors rising concerns over debt, inflation, and policy fatigue. His shift toward Ethereum suggests that even traditional investors are starting to view blockchain assets as protection against currency erosion. If global devaluation continues, Ethereum‚Äôs real-world utility in decentralized finance, tokenization, and smart contracts could make it a digital parallel to silver, limited in supply and increasingly adopted by institutions. For now, Ethereum‚Äôs consolidation near $3,800 reflects market caution. A clear move above $4,050 could revive momentum toward $4,400, while failure to hold $3,720 risks further downside. Kiyosaki‚Äôs argument highlights a changing mindset: investors are redefining what holds value in an economy driven by digital systems. If he‚Äôs right, Ethereum could emerge as one of the main winners in that transition. Presale Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Combines BTC Security With Solana Speed Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). Its goal is to expand the BTC ecosystem by enabling lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation.

Investors are scanning the horizon for the next 1000x crypto, the projects that combine strong fundamentals with viral community appeal. This new phase of digital finance is no longer driven solely by hype. It is built on real utility, clear tokenomics, and innovation that outpace market trends. From presale tokens like BullZilla to blockchain staples such as Ethereum (ETH), and privacy innovators like Monero (XMR), a handful of projects are beginning to stand out. Analysts are calling them hidden gems with massive upside, each uniquely positioned to outperform as sentiment shifts from caution to optimism. Let‚Äôs explore the six projects experts believe could define the next bull cycle. 1. BullZilla ($BZIL): The Beast of the Presale Arena BullZilla ($BZIL) has quickly become one of the most discussed projects heading into 2025. A fusion of meme coin energy and disciplined presale tokenomics, it‚Äôs emerging as one of the most promising next 1000x crypto opportunities this year. Currently in Stage 6B (Going Full Send!-B), the token is priced at $0.00014574 and has already raised over $850,000, with more than 2,800 h olders and 30 billion tokens sold. Each stage in BullZilla‚Äôs structured presale automatically increases the price as funding milestones are reached, ensuring steady valuation growth. The upcoming Stage 6C will raise the price by 4.57%, from $0.00014574 to $0.0001524, signaling another short window for early investors to secure tokens before the next jump. The token‚Äôs ROI potential is among the strongest in the market. From its early presale at Stage 1A ($0.00000575) to the current Stage 6B price, BZIL has already gained 2,434.6%. At the projected listing price of $0.00527141, the ROI climbs to an impressive 3,516.99%. A $1,000 investment right now secures about 6.86 million BZIL tokens, worth roughly $36,169.96 at listing. This structured, data-driven model delivers predictability and long-term incentives, something rare in the meme coin space. The community-driven ‚ÄúRoar Drop‚Äù event, triggered after each stage completion, continues to fuel engagement and deflation through strategic burns. With transparent tracking, verified liquidity, and over 30 billion tokens already sold, BullZilla stands as the clear frontrunner among presales poised for explosive returns in 2025. 2. Monero (XMR): Privacy‚Äôs Powerhouse Reclaims Its Crown Monero (XMR) has long been the leader in blockchain privacy. As the global focus on financial surveillance intensifies, Monero‚Äôs relevance is increasing once again. In a market dominated by transparent blockchains, Monero offers complete anonymity through its stealth addresses and ring signature system. Its current valuation positions it among the hidden gems with massive upside. The upcoming updates to its privacy protocol and wallet integrations could drive new adoption among users seeking secure, trace-free transactions. With over 18 million tokens in circulation, Monero remains a scarce asset with consistent demand. As regulatory pressure mounts on centralized exchanges, XMR could see renewed inflows, positioning it as one of the next 1000x crypto projects for investors betting on privacy as the next central narrative. 3. MoonBull (MOBU): The Meme Token Built on Conviction MoonBull is redefining the concept of meme tokens by blending humor with tangible utility. Built on Ethereum, MoonBull offers reflections, auto-liquidity, and a 23-stage scarcity system that encourages long-term holding. Its 95% APY staking model and instant referral bonuses create consistent passive income streams for its growing user base. What makes MoonBull unique is its AI-driven staking optimizer. It dynamically reallocates rewards based on liquidity conditions, ensuring sustainable yields even during market downturns. Liquidity is fully locked, and the smart contract has been verified, offering transparency and security. For many, MoonBull is more than a joke coin. It is a community movement with real staking power. Analysts view it as an altcoin poised for explosive growth, combining DeFi mechanics with viral branding. As meme culture continues to influence crypto investment behavior, MoonBull‚Äôs approach could make it one of the next 1000x crypto contenders to watch. 4. La Culex (CULEX): The Hive of Growth and Utility La Culex (CULEX) has been gaining traction as a presale phenomenon built for both safety and scalability. It combines meme aesthetics with robust economics, a combination rarely achieved in this space. With a total supply of 200 billion tokens, its allocation is carefully balanced. 45% for presale, 15% staking rewards, 20% locked liquidity for 18 months, and 2 billion tokens burned. The project‚Äôs 32-stage presale structure makes each phase incrementally scarcer, targeting a $0.007 listing price. Staking through the Hive Vault offers 80% APY, while its 12% referral system (via the Bite Chain) drives viral growth. The absence of transaction taxes and the presence of an audited contract make it a secure pick for retail investors. Analysts highlight La Culex as one of 2025‚Äôs hidden gems with massive upside. The project‚Äôs blend of creativity and calculated tokenomics has earned it a spot among the next 1000x crypto lineup before the bull cycle intensifies. 5. ASTER (ASTER): The Network Redefining Web3 Connectivity ASTER has emerged as a strong player in the next 1000x crypto conversation due to its focus on multi-chain scalability and user accessibility. Its technology connects Web3 ecosystems through smart contract interoperability, bridging Ethereum, Polygon, and Binance Smart Chain. This interoperability enables ASTER to serve as a backbone for dApp developers. With partnerships expanding across DeFi and gaming, it has already integrated with major protocols that boost on-chain liquidity. Analysts view ASTER as a hidden gem with massive upside, citing its rapid developer adoption and strong roadmap. As more users seek decentralized connectivity and reduced fees, ASTER is set to position itself among altcoins poised for significant growth in 2025. 6. WLFI (World Liberty Financial): DeFi Meets Institutional-Grade Design WLFI (World Liberty Financial) is one of the most promising next 1000x crypto projects for 2025. It seeks to merge traditional finance efficiency with decentralized trading freedom. The project‚Äôs architecture supports liquidity pools that operate with near-zero slippage, allowing institutional investors to enter DeFi safely. WLFI‚Äôs governance token offers staking rewards, voting rights, and profit-sharing mechanisms tied to the platform‚Äôs transaction volume. The team‚Äôs focus on compliance, transparency, and real-world utility makes it one of the few DeFi projects bridging retail and institutional adoption. Experts have labeled WLFI one of the hidden gems with massive upside, as it could redefine how traditional traders approach DeFi markets. If it delivers on its roadmap, it could easily become one of the most influential altcoins ready to explode this year. 7. CRO (Cronos): The Bridge Between Centralized and Decentralized Systems CRO, the native token of the Crypto.com ecosystem, continues to strengthen its reputation as a utility-driven blockchain asset. It powers the Cronos Chain, an Ethereum-compatible network built for fast, low-cost transactions and seamless dApp development. With interoperability across Cosmos and Ethereum, CRO enables efficient cross-chain trading and access to DeFi. Crypto.com‚Äôs continued expansion into NFT marketplaces and Web3 gaming has only added to the coin‚Äôs appeal. As adoption grows, CRO‚Äôs deflationary tokenomics and utility across payments, staking, and credit systems make it a reliable next 1000x crypto candidate.

While Bitcoin and Ethereum have held above key levels, XRP is still shaky due to whale selling, ETF delays and overall risk aversion. The current market cap stands at $142.7 billion, ranking XRP fifth among major cryptocurrencies. The coin‚Äôs recent price weakness comes amid growing concern that Bitcoin‚Äôs consolidation below $112,000 could prolong XRP‚Äôs correction phase before any meaningful recovery begins. Whales Exit, ETF Delays Weigh on Sentiment Over the past month, XRP‚Äôs largest holders offloaded more than 400 million tokens, roughly $1.25 billion worth, accelerating the recent selloff. The outflow coincided with a U.S. government shutdown that forced the SEC to delay reviews of seven pending XRP-spot ETF applications. XRP sees sustained whale selling, with holders of 1M‚Äì10M tokens reducing balances by 440M #XRP over 30 days, leaving $6.51B in holdings. $50M/day outflows pressure $XRP sentiment, keeping price fragile near $3.30. Full Article https://t.co/MZdPZtZ6dI ‚Äî Coin Edition: Your Crypto News Edge (@CoinEdition) October 11, 2025 Expected initially between October 18 and November 14, these approvals were postponed due to limited SEC staffing. Betting platform Kalshi now predicts the shutdown could last up to 25 days, further pushing back regulatory decisions. Analysts expect that once government operations resume, ETF approvals could restore sentiment and potentially lift XRP toward $3.30. ‚ÄúXRP‚Äôs drop today looked like that whale-feeding clip in real time big players scooping liquidity while smaller traders got swallowed.

Classic case of whales tightening their grip amid macro‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/n4lOKutsxP ‚Äî Charles Ugochukwu Odizuru-Abangwu Jr. (@Eze_Nwakaibeya) October 11, 2025 However, the absence of updates from BlackRock‚Äôs iShares XRP Trust and weak retail participation continue to cap upside momentum. Meanwhile, broader market stress following Donald Trump‚Äôs 100% tariff announcement on Chinese imports has compounded selling pressure across crypto assets. The move triggered a sharp global risk-off wave, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq down over 2% and Bitcoin falling more than 10% in a single day. XRP Technical Outlook: Triangle Breakdown in Play From a technical standpoint , XRP is under pressure after breaking below a multi-month symmetrical triangle that had guided the price since July. The break below $2.70 triggered stop loss cascades that brought XRP to the $2.30 zone, its lowest in months. The 100-day simple moving average (SMA) at $2.63 is immediate resistance, while the RSI at 26.9 is oversold. Although this means there is room for a short-term bounce, resistance at $2.70-$2.80 could lead to more selling. XRP Price Chart ‚Äì Source: Tradingview If bearish momentum continues, targets are at $2.02, a key Fibonacci level, then $1.77, where XRP last consolidated before the July rally. Watch for a Doji or hammer candle at $2.30, which could be a sign of selling exhaustion and a short-term reversal. #XRP faces heavy pressure after breaking below its multi-month triangle. Price hovers near $2.38, with RSI at 27 showing deep oversold conditions. A brief rebound toward $2.70‚Äì$2.80 is possible before sellers re-test $2.02 support. Bulls need a breakout above $2.80. pic.twitter.com/A1VHK4i0V2 ‚Äî Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) October 12, 2025 For traders, a cautious strategy involves buying near support with stops below $2.25, targeting a recovery to $2.80‚Äì$3.18 if momentum stabilizes. However, sustained weakness in Bitcoin could delay a full recovery, suggesting that XRP may not have bottomed yet. Outlook: Buy the Dip, But Wait for Bitcoin While XRP‚Äôs short-term outlook is bearish, its fundamentals ‚Äî especially ETF and institutional interest ‚Äî will recover. The market will turn once Bitcoin is above $115,000, and then XRP will regain lost ground. Until then, traders eyeing a rebound may find opportunities in accumulating near $2.00‚Äì$2.30, as the broader correction could set the stage for a stronger Q4 recovery once macro headwinds ease. Presale Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Combines BTC Security With Solana Speed Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM).

The outcomes could reshape institutional flows and trigger a new bull phase that stretches through Q4. However, while the spotlight shines on blue chips, traders are also watching one under-the-radar token that‚Äôs turning early momentum into genuine investor excitement: Little Pepe (LILPEPE). Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Wild Card with Meme Power and Real Infrastructure While ETFs dominate headlines, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is drawing quiet attention from traders seeking asymmetric upside. Built as a Layer-2 blockchain optimized for meme tokens, Little Pepe blends culture with performance. Its zero-tax model, sniper bot protection, and ultra-fast EVM-compatible structure make it a rare meme coin with utility beyond speculation. The presale has already raised over $26.7 million in Stage 13, pricing each token at $0.0022, with nearly 95% of the allocation sold. The planned listing price of $0.003 gives early buyers a built-in 36% paper gain, even before public trading begins. With community traction surging and whales quietly accumulating, traders see parallels to early Shiba Inu cycles but with far better tokenomics. If LILPEPE hits even a modest $0.15 by 2026, that‚Äôs a 68√ó return from current presale pricing, a performance that could eclipse most ETF-driven plays in sheer ROI. Ripple (XRP): Eyes on Six ETF Filings Ripple‚Äôs ETF story is finally coming to a head. There are six pending spot XRP ETF filings, all awaiting decisions within the same October window, which runs from October 18th to 24th. There‚Äôs one, the Franklin Templeton XRP ETF, set for review on 14 November. According to prediction markets on Polymarket, approval odds are at 97%, suggesting growing confidence that the SEC will give XRP its long-awaited green light. XRP trades near $0.62, and could move toward $1.20 post-approval if inflows mirror Bitcoin‚Äôs early ETF surge. Solana (SOL): Set to Join Bitcoin and Ethereum in the ETF Club Solana is next in line. Between October 10 and 16, five ETF applications are on the SEC‚Äôs review calendar, including filings from Grayscale, VanEck, 21Shares, Canary, and Bitwise. A Polymarket forecast from early September showed 82% approval odds, and the sentiment has only grown stronger as institutional filings ramp up. If approved, Solana would become the third major Layer-1 ETF in the U.S., after Bitcoin and Ethereum. Analysts estimate that institutional inflows could easily exceed $3‚Äì5 billion within the first 90 days, potentially propelling SOL toward $400. Cardano (ADA): A Critical Decision on October 26 Cardano‚Äôs turn comes on October 26, when the SEC is expected to deliver a final verdict on the Grayscale ADA ETF filing. After several extensions, this decision is final ‚Äî approve or reject. Polymarket data indicates approval expectations at 90%, reflecting Cardano‚Äôs growing reputation among institutional analysts. Beyond the ETF, ADA has been buoyed by Grayscale‚Äôs launch of the CoinDesk Crypto 5 ETF, which already includes Cardano alongside Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Solana. ADA trades at around $0.79 with a market capitalization of nearly $29 billion. Approval could send ADA testing prices $1.20‚Äì$1.50, closing in on its all-time high of $3.09 from 2021. Chainlink (LINK): The Institutional Bridge Chainlink has emerged as the bridge between traditional finance and Web3. It‚Äôs no surprise that Grayscale and Bitwise both filed for LINK ETFs this quarter, the former aiming to convert its Chainlink Trust into a spot ETF on NYSE Arca under the ticker $GLNK. Chainlink‚Äôs value proposition lies in data integrity. With partnerships now spanning the U.S. Department of Commerce and the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), Chainlink‚Äôs oracles feed macroeconomic and market data directly onto blockchain networks. LINK trades near $21.20, and analysts project a potential move toward $50‚Äì$80 if ETF approval triggers large-scale inflows. Conclusion ETF approvals for XRP, SOL, ADA, LINK, and XLM will mark a massive milestone in crypto adoption. But while regulated coins invite safer, steady gains, the raw speculative energy that drives true 50√ó‚Äì100√ó stories is now unfolding elsewhere. Because when the ETF dust settles and the next bull wave begins, history shows the biggest winners often start small, loud, and underestimated like Little Pepe (LILPEPE) .

It appeared to be a planned strike aimed straight at Binance and one of its biggest market makers, according to analysis from Colin Wu. The weak spot was Binance‚Äôs Unified Account margin system, which let traders use certain volatile assets as collateral. That design flaw gave attackers a clear target, and they hit it hard. Instead of sticking to standard USDT or coin-margined positions, Binance allowed traders to post proof-of-stake derivatives and yield-bearing stablecoins as collateral. The three assets that took the worst hits were USDE, wBETH, and BnSOL. Their liquidation prices came from Binance‚Äôs own spot order book, not from assets with hard pegs. BUSD, however, stayed solid thanks to its fixed peg, and on-chain Aave oracle data for USDE still showed a clean 1:1 ratio, which meant the chaos came entirely from Binance‚Äôs internal pricing system. Collateral collapse triggers mass liquidations When Bitcoin and altcoins started tumbling, the damage multiplied. Coin-margined traders were already bleeding, and the sudden depegging of collateral killed their remaining margin value. USDE crashed to $0.65, wBETH plunged to $0.20, and BnSOL hit $0.13. Even hedged positions didn‚Äôt stand a chance. As margin balances evaporated, liquidations exploded across Binance futures. Traders got wiped out, and market makers were forced to close everything, dumping their holdings just to survive. The problem got worse because of Binance‚Äôs 12% yield program, which pushed large stablecoin holders to use Bn lending products for recursive USDE borrowing. That setup amplified exposure. When the crash came, it dragged those leveraged loops down with it. On-chain redemptions for USDE stayed fine, but prices on Binance plunged way below other exchanges, most stayed near $0.9, while Binance‚Äôs prices fell far deeper. Even altcoins on Binance hit abnormal lows, a sign of large-scale forced liquidations. The scale was massive. Within 24 hours, Binance recorded $3.5‚Äì4 billion in trading volume from USDE, wBETH, and BnSOL. Estimated losses ranged between $500 million and $1 billion. Covering that would mean Binance absorbing a billion-dollar hit. Analysts pointed to a clear failure in how margin collateral and liquidation pricing were structured, flaws that made the system easy to exploit. Timing exposes planning behind the attack What makes this look deliberate is timing. The attack happened right between Binance‚Äôs oracle price update announcement on October 6 and the actual rollout on October 14. That gave attackers eight full days to prepare. Binance‚Äôs risk team had noticed some exposure, but the delay created an open window, and the exploit slipped right through it. Experts warned that for PoS-based assets, oracles should keep a hard floor price, even with liquidity discounts. Relying only on spot prices inside an exchange, especially one where both counterparty and operational risks are internal, is asking for trouble. The question of whether USDE is truly backed 1:1 is still hanging. The Luna-UST collapse proved how bad things can get when pegs fail. Back then, Binance lost money defending UST near $0.7. If the exchange insists on keeping USDE as margin collateral, limiting how much can be pledged would make more sense than pretending everything is stable. Tom Lee, chairman of BitMine, told CNBC the market‚Äôs pullback was ‚Äúoverdue‚Äù after a 36% gain since April. He said the VIX jumped 29%, calling it one of the top 1% largest single-day volatility spikes in history. He called the sell-off ‚Äúa healthy shakeout,‚Äù saying short-term returns could turn positive soon. Investor @mindaoyang on X compared this crash to LUNA‚Äôs implosion. He said the danger comes from exchanges using non-fiat stablecoins as high-value collateral, letting risk spread everywhere. He warned that mixing market-based pricing with high collateral ratios is the most dangerous setup, especially when centralized exchanges have poor arbitrage efficiency. He added that LSD-type assets, those yield-bearing tokens disguised as ‚Äústable,‚Äù face the same problem: they look calm on the surface but move like volatile crypto underneath.

After a volatile summer that saw $600 million in liquidations across leveraged positions, ETH appears to be forming a strong technical base around $4,000 ‚Äî setting up what could be the next major push toward $6,000. Meanwhile, the DeFi ecosystem continues to shift under its own weight. Aster, one of the more talked-about networks of the year, is sparking volatility across decentralized markets following delisting controversies and whale exits. As liquidity flows adjust, capital rotation is brewing ‚Äî and it‚Äôs not just flowing back into Ethereum. Speculative energy is once again igniting the meme coin space, where AlphaPepe (ALPE) has quickly become the most talked-about project of Q4. Ethereum‚Äôs Path Toward $6,000 Ethereum‚Äôs short-term chart looks constructive despite its mid-year weakness. After dropping below $4,000 during liquidation cascades, ETH has regained footing within the $3,800‚Äì$4,200 range. Technical analysts point to the $4,300 zone as the ‚Äúmomentum gateway.‚Äù If ETH can close several daily candles above that level, a climb toward $4,800‚Äì$5,000 becomes increasingly likely. The broader fundamentals also support this setup. Exchange balances have fallen to multi-year lows, meaning fewer tokens are available to sell. Post-Dencun upgrades, such as EIP-4844, have reduced Layer-2 transaction costs and improved scalability, spurring fresh on-chain activity and long-term optimism. Another factor is Ethereum‚Äôs renewed adoption narrative. Wallet-native derivatives integrations, like MetaMask‚Äôs on-chain perpetuals feature, are bringing trading activity back onto decentralized rails. This ‚Äúalways-on‚Äù on-chain leverage could amplify ETH‚Äôs next trend ‚Äî and in bull phases, that feedback loop often accelerates gains far beyond expectations. If momentum holds, ETH reclaiming $5,000 before year-end would not be surprising. A clean macro environment, combined with sustained network activity, could make $6,000 a realistic stretch target in early 2025. The Aster Effect: Volatility and Opportunity The Aster network, once seen as a rising star in the DeFi landscape, has recently been rocked by controversy. Its delisting from DeFiLlama due to data integrity concerns ‚Äî followed by whale outflows ‚Äî triggered sharp volatility in its token price. For investors, it‚Äôs another reminder of how quickly sentiment can shift in decentralized markets. Aster‚Äôs turbulence, however, is having broader implications. Risk capital that once sought exposure to speculative DeFi plays is now flowing into narratives with cleaner transparency and community validation. Traders are looking for simpler, stronger, and more emotionally resonant investments ‚Äî and historically, that‚Äôs where meme coins thrive. As Aster continues to recover from its reputational shake-up, it‚Äôs inadvertently reigniting speculative appetite across the meme sector, particularly toward tokens that offer verifiable security and strong community traction. AlphaPepe (ALPE): The Breakout Meme Coin of Q4 In this environment, AlphaPepe has emerged as the standout winner. It‚Äôs not just another meme token ‚Äî it‚Äôs the meme coin that‚Äôs rewriting how presales are built. Operating on BNB Chain, AlphaPepe merges viral internet humor with audited, long-term tokenomics. Its presale has been nothing short of explosive, now nearing $300,000 raised, with its second USDT pool surpassing $7,000 in record time. Despite wider market turbulence, the project‚Äôs inflows are accelerating ‚Äî a clear sign of trust and momentum. AlphaPepe‚Äôs appeal lies in its structure. Tokens are delivered instantly to investors, ensuring transparency from day one. Liquidity will be locked indefinitely, eliminating one of the biggest fears in meme investing, and the project has completed a full smart-contract audit, solidifying its legitimacy. On top of that, holders can earn up to 85% APR through staking, making it one of the few meme coins that actively rewards community participation. Market analysts are now calling AlphaPepe the ‚Äú100√ó meme coin of 2025,‚Äù predicting its post-listing performance could rival early-stage runs of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Its unique mix of humor, DeFi credibility, and community growth has positioned it at the top of every watchlist this quarter. Why Q4 Is Perfect for Meme Coins Historically, meme tokens thrive in recovery phases. After major corrections, when traders are cautious about re-entering large caps, speculative energy often rotates toward high-upside plays with strong communities. Dogecoin dominated this space in 2021, Shiba Inu followed in 2022, and PEPE defined 2023. 2025‚Äôs rotation appears to belong to AlphaPepe. With Ethereum regaining confidence and Aster volatility redistributing liquidity, meme coins with real structure have become the market‚Äôs sweet spot for risk capital. AlphaPepe‚Äôs combination of meme virality, audited transparency, and rapid presale traction makes it the clear frontrunner of this next wave. Ethereum vs. Meme Rotation: Complementary Trends Rather than competing, Ethereum‚Äôs stability and AlphaPepe‚Äôs speculation may feed off each other. As ETH rises, confidence across crypto grows ‚Äî and when confidence grows, retail traders chase volatility. Meme coins historically capture that liquidity early, often outperforming majors during short-term surges. For strategic investors, this setup offers a dual-path opportunity: accumulate ETH for steady upside while allocating a small portion toward emerging meme projects like AlphaPepe for potential exponential returns. Conclusion Ethereum‚Äôs price trajectory remains constructive despite short-term noise. With strong fundamentals, on-chain upgrades, and shrinking exchange reserves, a rally toward $6,000 by early 2025 is within reach. Aster‚Äôs volatility may unsettle DeFi, but it‚Äôs also catalyzing renewed attention on simpler, community-driven projects ‚Äî where meme tokens like AlphaPepe are thriving. As AlphaPepe‚Äôs presale approaches $300,000 and analysts project 100√ó potential, it‚Äôs carving out its place as the top meme coin to buy in Q4. The timing could hardly be better: Ethereum is strengthening, risk appetite is rebounding, and the meme market is awakening.

Traditionally, the ETH surges inject much-needed investor confidence and liquidity into other high growth altcoins, the end result is great market rally. Ripple (XRP), and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , the most well-positioned to capitalize on the next big breakout from Ethereum are both representing very different corners of the crypto market, legacy utility, and next-gen DeFi brilliance. The current Phase 6 presale of MUTM is over 65% sold out at $0.035. As the dual-lending DeFi concept where borrowers are capable of both lending out and accessing loans comes to the fore, MUTM‚Äôs price valuation is set to reach an easy $1 to $3 as investors are on the hunt for high-potential tokens. XRP Aims Rebound as Ethereum Aims $10,000 XRP holds steady around the $2.73 support level, the prime level most likely to decide where the next big movement comes from. Analysts are predicting that if the buyers maintain this price area, the highly anticipated reversal to $3.10 will come soon, the mojo of the altcoin regaining hint an indication general market euphoria spreads. As the overall market anticipates the probable ETH surge to $10,000 to lift the spirits around the cryptocurrency circle, XRP stands poised to capitalize the bullish wave and take key resistance points to reach as high as $7. While XRP‚Äôs promise remains bright for the short term, most investors are poised to divert their attention to rising DeFi play Mutuum Finance (MUTM), set to capitalize even much bigger long-term growth potential. Mutuum Finance Presale Mass Hysteria Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging soon as one to watch out for in the DeFi sector. It is already on Phase 6 presale, with the retailing tokens cost $0.035 up 16.17% from Phase 5. Already over 16,860 investors have invested, investing over $17.25 million worth into the project, having trust in the project‚Äôs long-term road map alongside DeFi dream. With over 65% sold out so far during Phase 6, investors have very little time to purchase the tokens before the phase runs out. The early investors have the potential to gain humongous profits when MUTM will be listed on the open market. The project is also cooperating with CertiK to present the $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program, where white-hat hackers, developers, and security experts are rewarded for the discovery of bugs. Bugs are ranked by severity level, critical, major, minor, and low, paid correspondingly, and the minor bugs are fixed immediately in real time for the maximum security on the platform. Next-Gen Borrowing and Lending Protocol Mutuum Finance will also unveil its lending and borrowing protocol , establishing its DeFi platform. Version 1 (V1), coming out on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025, will have the principal features including liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, as well as the liquidator bot. ETH and USDT will be compatible on the very first day for collateralization, lending, as well as borrowing, with the capability for an end-to-end DeFi solution that is secure, scalable, as well as user-friendly. Best Crypto to Buy as Ethereum Targets $10,000 In the case Ethereum spikes to $10,000, altcoins like Ripple (XRP) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will have the potential for tremendous capital growth. Analysts have XRP aiming for $8‚Äì$10, while MUTM, valued currently at $0.035 during Phase 6, will rocket to $1‚Äì$3. With $17.25M raised, over 16,860 investors, 60% sold, the dual-lending strategy and DeFi targeting by Mutuum provide the foundation for breakout growth.

The digital asset experienced a notable dip , briefly falling below $2 before mounting a strong recovery. The sharp fall, followed by a swift rebound, marked a striking shift in market sentiment within a single day. The event gained added visibility after a post from XRP Update (@XrpUdate), a well-known crypto influencer on X, who shared a video capturing the movement. In the post, the influencer described it as the comeback of the year, following what he called the biggest crash in years, emphasizing that committed holders of the asset had remained steadfast through the turbulence. THE $XRP COMEBACK OF THE YEAR AFTER THE BIGGEST CRASH IN YEARS‚Ä¶ WE JUST WITNESSED THE MOST EPIC COMEBACK IN HISTORY DIAMOND HANDS PREVAILED AGAIN pic.twitter.com/lZkkGTF0RG ‚Äî XRP Update (@XrpUdate) October 11, 2025 A Rapid Fall and Recovery The data showed XRP initially trading above $2.8 before the massive crash. The asset dropped below $2 for the first time since June , marking a sudden and steep fall that rattled parts of the market. Yet, the decline proved temporary. Within hours, XRP recovered to above $2.4 and is currently trading at $2.37, with a 24-hour high of $2.50. The last comparable drop occurred in 2018, when XRP‚Äôs price fell from its previous peak above $3 to below $1. The recovery from this downturn took years, as XRP did not reach $1 until 2021, and traded below $3 until early 2025. In contrast, this week‚Äôs rebound occurred within a single session. The pace of the recovery has drawn renewed attention to the XRP‚Äôs strength and the persistence of ‚Äúdiamond hand‚Äù investors during extreme volatility. Market Sentiment and Investor Response XRP Update‚Äôs post quickly became a central point of conversation among traders following the market event. He characterized the movement as an extraordinary comeback and praised the persistence of the diamond hand investors who continued holding through the drop. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The message resonated with the community‚Äôs long-term holders, who are often proud of maintaining positions during significant market drops. Many interpreted the rebound as a show of resilience for an asset with the potential to dominate the crypto space. What‚Äôs Next for XRP? Over its trading history, XRP has been characterized by large price swings tied to both market cycles and regulatory developments. The most recent fluctuation, though short-lived, was a response to a broader market correction. Investors expect a major change soon. One of the biggest reasons is the potential SEC approval of multiple spot XRP ETFs over the next 2 weeks . With the asset now trading just below $2.4, the market is excited for an explosive rally once these products enter the market.

The decision of course reignited tensions between both governments just weeks after they claimed to have reached a ‚Äúbasic consensus‚Äù during talks in Madrid. On Sunday, Beijing‚Äôs Commerce Ministry accused the U.S. of violating the trade truce by introducing new export restrictions since the September meeting. The ministry said, ‚ÄúWillful threats of high tariffs are not the right way to get along with China,‚Äù insisting the country ‚Äúdoes not want a trade war, but is not afraid of one.‚Äù Washington had recently expanded its chip export rules to block Beijing‚Äôs access to advanced semiconductors and software. Trump responded by declaring that his government would apply 100% tariffs and extend curbs to ‚Äúany and all critical software.‚Äù Xi and Trump clash over rare earth restrictions The latest escalation came after China unveiled broad global controls on products containing even traces of rare earths, materials essential to artificial intelligence, electric vehicles, and weapons manufacturing. Trump fired back by threatening to walk away from the upcoming Asia-Pacific summit in Gyeongju, South Korea, where he and Xi were expected to meet later this month. He said Beijing‚Äôs rare earth policy would ‚Äúhold the world captive,‚Äù a remark that triggered a $2 trillion plunge in global stock markets. Beijing viewed the truce sealed in Geneva and reinforced in London earlier this year as an agreement to halt any new restrictions on vital shipments. Xi‚Äôs government now considers that understanding broken. Zhou Mi, a senior researcher at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, said, ‚ÄúWe will not be intimidated by such coercive and unilateral actions of power politics. Our actions have clearly shown this.‚Äù Both sides appear to be leaving room for compromise. Trump‚Äôs tariffs are due to take effect on November 1, just before China‚Äôs new curbs begin the following week, coinciding with the expiration of their last temporary deal that capped tariffs at 145%. Beijing expands curbs and targets shipping fees Within hours of tightening the export controls, China announced it would start charging U.S. ships docking at Chinese ports from October 14, mirroring a new American fee on Chinese vessels entering U.S. ports that takes effect the same day. The Commerce Ministry called the step ‚Äúnecessary passive defensive actions,‚Äù accusing Washington of ‚Äúseriously undermining the atmosphere of the economic and trade talks.‚Äù The Center for Strategic and International Studies reported that the U.S. makes up just 0.1% of global shipbuilding compared to China‚Äôs 53.3% share. Trade officials from both sides have met several times this year (in Geneva, London, and Stockholm) to draft a trade framework. The most recent discussions in Madrid in September produced a tentative deal on the divestment of Chinese-owned TikTok, ahead of the U.S. deadline to either sell its American unit or shut it down. On September 19, Trump and Xi spoke by phone to finalize the next steps, agreeing to meet at the Asia-Pacific summit. However, after China tightened its export curbs, Trump publicly threatened to cancel the meeting. Analysts at Hutong Research said , ‚ÄúWashington‚Äôs fear of China is strategic, not economic. A disruption in rare earth flows threatens defense production capacity, a core pillar of U.S. global power projection and, by extension, dollar stability.‚Äù China accounts for about 70% of the global supply and has repeatedly used the critically needed minerals as a bargaining chip in trade discussions.

The SOL coin is currently trading close to the $220 region after a 3.2% decline on the weekly chart. However, a new player, Remittix (RTX) , is quickly gaining attention in the PayFi sector. With its practical uses and strong backing, Remittix is set to become a major force in the crypto market, potentially offering even bigger returns than Solana as it leads the next wave of crypto innovation. The broader crypto market registered modest volatility this week following renewed trade tensions between the U.S. and China after Donald Trump‚Äôs comments on tariffs provoked a fleeting selloff on risk assets. However, interest in utility-backed tokens like Remittix continues to grow as investors appreciate functionality over speculation. Solana Price Predicted to Reach $250 SOL has been trading around the $180 mark over the past few days and the recent support has been at this price point. The coin has been resisting around $200 and has not been able to sustain an upward trend. Although the long-term Solana price prediction is optimistic, the recent price movement indicates that the market is experiencing a state of indecision. Analysts predict that the Solana price might rise to $250 in case of increased buying pressure in the market. But first, the SOL coin must cross the resistance around $225 for bullish action to follow. With investors holding back following international market jitters, Solana‚Äôs short-term trend is reflective of the same consolidation observed in top altcoins. Remittix Taps Into PayFi Sector To Give Holders 20x Gains While Solana battles with resistance, Remittix is gaining attention in the PayFi sector where it bridges real world payments with DeFi. The project has raised over $27.3 million in capital and sold over 677.4 million tokens, currently priced at $0.1130 which is a good sign of confidence among investors. The project bridges the gap between crypto and fiat, enabling users to transfer digital assets to bank accounts in 30+ countries at low cost and top speed. It is providing what meme coins never had, practical use with quantifiable outcomes, with instant transfers, zero FX charges, and a wallet that is easy to use. As macro uncertainty rises, Remittix‚Äôs focus on trusted and verified security through CertiK stands as a counterintuitive argument against the volatility of the wider market. Remittix Gains Investor Attention With Focus on Security Remittix has secured the #1 spot among top pre-launch tokens, with a CertiK verification further boosting its credibility and security. With its $250,000 giveaway and a 15% USDT referral program, the platform has successfully engaged a growing community of early adopters, positioning itself for future growth.

An Expert Explains,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/why-was-the-drop-in-altcoins-so-significant-an-expert-explains/,"The cryptocurrency market experienced one of the biggest single-day losses in recent years with a sharp decline on Friday night. The loss in value reached billions of dollars. Experts say that following this collapse, signs of a gradual stabilization are emerging in the markets. The decline came shortly after the US government announced new tariffs on technology products imported from China. This development caused panic among investors and triggered a chain reaction of selling in the markets. ‚ÄúInvestors were forced to close their positions, causing prices to go into free fall,‚Äù Joshua Duckett, director of a cryptocurrency forensic analysis firm, said in a statement. Duckett stated that leveraged trading magnifies losses, saying, ‚ÄúLosses in leveraged trading in the crypto sector are at billions of dollars. Some people lost hundreds of dollars, some thousands, some millions.‚Äù Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, fell below $102,000 during the crash, while Ethereum and other major altcoins also lost more than 20% in just a few hours. Investors, particularly those with high leverage, were unable to maintain their positions in the face of the sudden drop and were liquidated. Related News: Legendary Author Robert Kiyosaki Gives the Red Alert - ‚ÄúIt Will Happen This Year‚Äù - Surprisingly Points to Ethereum ‚ÄúThe crypto market reacted more strongly than the stock market because it is open 24/7,‚Äù Duckett said. ‚ÄúMany cryptocurrencies lost value in the last 24 hours. This was driven by both news and investor psychology.‚Äù Emphasizing the impact of leveraged trading on the market, Duckett said, ‚ÄúIn cryptocurrency, investors can borrow up to a hundred times their assets. When these positions are liquidated, large price movements are inevitable, but this time the direction was down.‚Äù Duckett stated that the sharp selling wave triggered chain liquidations, adding, ‚ÄúThis situation has created a liquidation spiral.‚Äù However, the outlook isn't entirely bleak. According to Duckett, signs of recovery are beginning to appear in the market: ‚ÄúThe market is currently in a state of equilibrium. How things will unfold tomorrow will depend on new developments.‚Äù The expert offered this final warning to investors: ‚ÄúThe number one rule is to never invest more than you can afford to lose.

Apple recommends that users save their Clips videos to the Photo library or other storage options. Users can save the videos with effects included , or they can download them without any effects. Apple said users can make new videos using their clips through iMovie or pivot to other third-party applications.

Clips was an app that let users apply filters, use music, or stitch photos, but it wasn‚Äôt a social media app. Throughout the years, Apple upgraded Clips and added new features to the app, but later on, the company limited its updates to bug fixes. Apple‚Äôs subreddit users were not surprised by the discontinuation of Clips. One user wrote, ‚ÄúMakes sense. Didn‚Äôt even know it existed.‚Äù Another user said that he tried the app a long time ago and found it confusing. A top 1% comment on Reddit voices his input and said Clips is probably a single developer project. He gave an example and said, ‚ÄúApple iTunes Remote was originally an app made by one guy.

Whales are cycling capital out around the resistance level for SOL, search volume is dissipating, new address growth is subdued, all omens that foretell SOL‚Äôs next leg up will be delayed. Conversely, alternative MUTM from the likes of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is fast becoming an increasingly appealing alternative. At a mere $0.035, MUTM is currently in Phase 6 of presale but already over 65% sold out, promising strong demand. Its dual-lending protocol, meanwhile, empowers users to lend an unlimited amount equal to the same protocol‚Äôs ability to have them borrow, while mechanics around yielding reals with an architecture custodial by design give an end-user-friendly foundation that many anticipate will leave legacy altcoins behind come 2025. Solana Navigates Significant Resistance Before Final Wave Rally‚Äôs End Solana (SOL) continues to struggle with the key $250 resistance level, one that has continued to dampen its rallies since 2021. After numerous breakout attempt, including an all-time high around $295 during this first half, SOL still has failed to gain sustained momentum above this psychological level. From the technical perspective, however, indicators are showing the formation of increasingly bullish tension, with the RSI above the 50 level backed by an upward MACD suggesting force. Analysts opine Solana is currently riding the fifth out of five possible uptrend waves, with the potential cap dropping anywhere from around $416 to $464 if the uptrend is sustained. However, with the spotlight focusing on projects developing novel innovations alongside utilities, most investors are reserving their attention on the rising DeFi challenger Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as Solana‚Äôs uptick tapers off. Mutuum Finance Soars during Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) remains in good stride, their sixth presale round almost sold out at 65% filled. Investor appetite remains extremely strong, with over 16,840 investors putting over $17.25 million worth into the project so far. Those are all-time records for MUTM and reflect the unstopping global confidence globally into the platform‚Äôs DeFi long-term prospect and potential ecosystem. On the heel of its mission to grow its decentralized ecosystem, the latest development from Mutuum Finance is that it will introduce its lending and borrowing protocol sometime in the future. The Platform‚Äôs Version 1 (V1) will deploy on the Sepolia Testnet during Q4 2025. The first rollout will have key features including liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, as well as the liquidator bot that will form the foundation of a healthy, efficient, and scalable DeFi architecture. Risk and Liquidity Protection The protocol also exercises an in-real-time risk management and liquidity management regime incorporated under the same to maintain stability and be functional during the event of distress. The protocol also automatically liquidates under-collaterallised or illiquid positions, including capping risk exposure levels so that contagion does not take place among the pools of assets. ETH and stablecoins are anchor collateral coins that offer stabilizing foundation support for riskier coins. Adaptive allocation of the reserve factor between asset classes maximizes risk versus reward optimization with improved overall system coverage for the reserves. In addition, the Mutuum Finance protocol also hedges the volatility in real-time together with the liquidity and adjusts dynamically to suit changing market conditions. It dynamically offsets Exposure management and short-selling pressures to avert forced liquidation so that even the most extreme market corrections have healthfully balanced the collateralization. In Real-Time DeFi, therefore, the systemic risk is contained and the DeFi platform is stable, strong, and predictable even during turbulent market conditions. The New Favorite as Solana Disappoints Solana (SOL) is displaying lagging momentum, while Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is picking up pace. A sold out over 65% phase 6 presale, raising over $17.25M from over 16,840 investors, puts Mutuum Finance (MUTM) in the spotlight. With its upcoming launch on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025, coupled with dynamic risk protection/liquidity, MUTM provides a stable, high-upside alternative to SOL. Participate in the presale for Mutuum Finance today before Phase 6 is sold out.

In a recent post over the weekend, Robert Kiyosaki envisioned a doomsday scenario in which Baby Boomers‚Äô retirement funds are ‚Äúgoing to be wiped out.‚Äù Worst Crash to Come Soon? The author and investor began his post by outlining the ‚Äúbiggest crash in world history‚Äù in his Rich Dad‚Äôs Prophecy book. What‚Äôs even more worrying is that he believes this calamity will take place in the next few months. His prediction comes after one of the most painful crashes in crypto history. Recall that BTC plunged by roughly $20,000 in hours, while many altcoins were obliterated with losses of up to 90% at one point. The liquidations set a record at over $19 billion within a 24-hour span after US President Trump imposed a new set of tariffs on Chinese products. Kiyosaki reaffirmed another one of his previous statements, that investors need to allocate funds only in ‚Äúreal assets‚Äù as ‚Äúsavers are losers.‚Äù According to him, those are gold, silver, Bitcoin, and Ethereum as of late. ‚ÄúToday, I believe silver and Ethereum are the best because they are stores of value‚Ä¶but more importantly‚Ä¶used in industry‚Ä¶and prices are low. Please study pros and cons and usefulness of silver and Ethereum‚Ä¶from haters and lovers of silver and Ethereum‚Ä¶and then invest with your own financial wisdom.‚Äù Actual Crash in Stock Markets? While he has been preaching that investors should go for gold, silver, BTC, and ETH, Kiyosaki has been criticizing the US stock market and the dollar. At the start of the month, he alleged that Wall Street will collapse soon, which is why even long-term stock proponent Warren Buffett had turned to gold. ‚ÄúEven though Buffett shit on gold and silver investors like me for years, his sickening endorsement of gold and silver must mean stocks and bonds are about to crash,‚Äù he said.

Large-scale movements of XRP tokens have lit up blockchain trackers, following the recent XRP price crash. Traders and analysts are now watching closely, trying to determine whether this is a sign of an impending price move, institutional repositioning, or simply internal exchange adjustments. Unusual Whale Transfers Caught on the Radar According to on-chain data shared by crypto analyst Xaif, several staggering XRP transactions were detected within hours. The most notable involved 145 million XRP ‚Äî valued at over $340 million ‚Äî being moved to Binance, one of the world‚Äôs largest crypto exchanges. Another 50 million XRP, worth around $124 million, was transferred between Bitfinex wallets, while an additional 50 million XRP, valued at approximately $137 million, shifted between unknown wallets. Xaif‚Äôs post quickly drew attention from the XRP community on X, where traders began speculating about the motive behind such enormous movements. Many interpreted it as a potential prelude to a major liquidity event or price swing. Massive XRP Whale Movements! ‚Üí145M XRP ($340.2M) moved to Binance ‚Üí50M XRP ($124M) transferred between Bitfinex wallets ‚Üí50M XRP ($137.4M) shifted between unknown wallets Whales are on the move something big brewing for #XRP ? pic.twitter.com/16luocGH3R ‚Äî Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) October 11, 2025 What These Transfers Could Mean Massive inflows to exchanges often raise eyebrows, as they can sometimes indicate that large holders or ‚Äúwhales‚Äù are preparing to sell portions of their holdings. When tokens are moved from cold wallets to exchange addresses, it increases the potential supply available for trading, which can add short-term pressure to prices. However, it‚Äôs also possible that these transfers are internal exchange operations or custodial rebalancing between institutional accounts. Bitfinex, for instance, regularly shuffles assets between its operational wallets for liquidity management. Similarly, the movement between unidentified wallets might reflect custodial transitions, not market-facing transactions. Market Implications and Community Reactions At the time of reporting, XRP‚Äôs price remains relatively stable despite the heavy flows, indicating that traders are still assessing the intent behind the moves. Market watchers have noted that large-scale transfers like these can precede periods of heightened volatility, especially when sentiment is already on edge. Within the XRP community, opinions are split. Some believe these whale movements are early signs of institutional positioning ahead of major developments, such as regulatory clarity or ETF-related announcements. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Others warn that such inflows to exchanges could be a precursor to profit-taking or market manipulation, as similar on-chain patterns have preceded sharp corrections in the past. The Bigger Picture Whale movements have always played a key role in crypto market psychology. They can shift sentiment, create fear or excitement, and occasionally precede major trend reversals. In the case of XRP, which has remained one of the most closely watched digital assets in 2025, every large transaction tends to generate speculation about broader strategic plays ‚Äî whether tied to Ripple‚Äôs ongoing global partnerships or upcoming ecosystem expansions. For now, all eyes remain on the blockchain data for follow-up movements. If these massive inflows are indeed heading toward active trading wallets, short-term volatility could intensify. But if they prove to be internal or custodial shifts, the impact may be minimal. Xaif‚Äôs revelation of these massive XRP whale transfers has undoubtedly reignited market curiosity. While the motive behind the $600 million-plus movements remains unclear, one thing is certain ‚Äî XRP‚Äôs on-chain activity has captured the community‚Äôs full attention. Whether these flows signal accumulation, redistribution, or preparation for a market shakeup, traders across the XRP Army are now bracing for what could be the next major chapter in the token‚Äôs price journey.
