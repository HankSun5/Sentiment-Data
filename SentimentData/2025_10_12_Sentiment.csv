Bitcoin fell 8.1% over the last 24 hours, with traders reacting to political uncertainty. Analysts pointed out that macroeconomic shocks remain a central factor in controlling the behavior of the market in the short term and determining the overall BTC price narrative going into the end of the year. Dogecoin‚Äôs price has also slipped as traders decreased their holdings of risk assets following the global selloff. Analysts noted that the most recent market pullout shows growing caution and renewed volatility in all digital assets. Despite the turmoil in the market, some altcoins are displaying surprising resilience. Amongst them is MAGACOIN FINANCE , a community-driven project that is gaining rapid traction in view of its upcoming exchange listings. Investors and analysts are already referring to it as a hidden 50X altcoin, pointing to a strong whale support and early adoption helping it defy the general downturn. Bitcoin Price Action ‚Äî Sellers Target the $100K Retest Bitcoin price now trades close to $111,871, down from the $125K resistance that was tested earlier this month. Technical charts indicate that BTC broke out of an ascending channel that supported the uptrend across 2025. The Parabolic SAR has flipped above price candles, indicating that short-term control has been transferred to sellers. Meanwhile, the RSI near 43 indicates a lack of conviction from buyers and more room for downside. Source: X Bitcoin is now trading within a broad consolidation zone between $100K ‚Äì $125K. A firm close below the trendline on a daily basis could pave the way for a complete retest of the $100K support, which is a significant psychological level for traders. If macroeconomic tensions persist and sentiment stays fragile, analysts note that the correction could come back as early as 2026. Still, some believe that once the $100K base holds, then Bitcoin may be poised for a recovery that brings the overall crypto market correction cycle back into another bull run. Dogecoin Holds Decade-Long Channel Support Dogecoin has continued to defy expectations. Despite doubt over its long-term fundamentals, the ten-year ascending channel for the coin still holds up. The most recent bounce from the lower boundary indicates that both algorithmic systems and institutional traders are closely monitoring these levels. Analyst Olivier √ê Maùïèimus pointed out DOGE‚Äôs rebound exactly at the point of the lower band of the channel, and redo the proof that the algorithm is reinforcing the same technical structure. Source: X The weekly chart highlights Dogecoin trading at $0.19 and $0.20 in a consistent manner with the previous cycle bottoms. Resistance is now near $0.34-$0.35 with potential upside targets towards $0.90, should the bullish pattern persist. Long-term extensions of the Fibonacci series set $5-$7 for possible highs, at extreme $10+ with force on reversed cycles. Such precision in trendlines suggests the existence of an ongoing institutional awareness and algorithmic involvement in Dogecoin‚Äôs market. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Traction as Hidden 50x Altcoin While Bitcoin and Dogecoin capture headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly building strong momentum beneath the surface. The project has attracted growing attention ahead of several upcoming exchange listings, which analysts believe could mark a turning point for its exposure. These listings have amplified interest among investors seeking early-stage exposure to a structured and transparent ecosystem. MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äôs roadmap emphasizes long-term utility, and its community-driven model and fixed supply framework have positioned it as one of the most promising entrants in this market cycle. Analysts project that once liquidity from exchange listings increases, the token could deliver 50x upside as broader retail and institutional participation expands. The Calm Before the Next Breakout The market reset has created both caution and opportunity. Bitcoin‚Äôs price may still retest $100K before stabilizing, while Dogecoin‚Äôs price continues to respect long-term trendlines that have guided it for nearly a decade. Both moves highlight how algorithmic systems and institutional traders still influence technical dynamics across major cryptocurrencies. At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the quiet frontrunner of this correction phase. Its upcoming exchange listings, transparent roadmap, and expanding community are driving accumulation even as larger assets decline. With analysts projecting up to 50x returns, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents the rare combination of early-stage opportunity and whale-driven confidence, a formula that could define the next chapter of the crypto market recovery.

This area now stands as a potential pivot point that could determine whether the popular meme coin rebounds toward $0.27 or continues its decline. Analysts are watching the zone closely, suggesting it could be a make-or-break moment for Dogecoin‚Äôs short-term structure. Dogecoin Price Holds IMB Zone As Bulls Eye $0.27 Crypto analyst ‚ÄòBlockchain Baller‚Äô disclosed on X social media on Thursday that Dogecoin has ‚Äútapped the IMB zone after a clean manipulation and structure break,‚Äù signaling the potential end of a corrective phase. At the time, the analyst‚Äôs 4-hour chart showed DOGE hovering around the $0.235 ‚Äì $0.245 region‚Äîan area that historically acts as a liquidity zone where price inefficiencies often get filled before a move higher. Related Reading: Sinking In Minutes: Binance Alpha Token Plunges 99% In Shocking Price Meltdown Blockchain Baller asserts that manipulation and structural breaks are both classic signs that the market may be preparing for a reversal. The analyst notes that price has reacted multiple times in the same region, showing that buyers are stepping in to defend the zone. The chart analysis also highlights the zone between $0.235 and $0.245 as the critical decision point for DOGE bulls. If price climbs back to this level and holds it as support, Blockchain Baller predicts a short-term rebound toward the $0.26 ‚Äì $0.27 range. For a bullish confirmation, the analyst suggests that the price would need to break above ‚Äúshort-term resistance‚Äú with increasing momentum. For now, Dogecoin‚Äôs immediate path seems to depend on how it reacts to the IMB zone. Blockchain Baller has indicated that a strong bounce could mark the beginning of a new impulsive leg, while a breakdown below $0.235 could temporarily delay recovery. Dogecoin Price Targets $6 Amid Market Decline On a broader timeframe, crypto market expert Kaleo has pointed out that Dogecoin‚Äôs market structure is gradually positioning itself for a major upward move. His long-term chart analysis draws striking parallels between DOGE‚Äôs current price action and the previous cycles observed before each Bitcoin halving event. In the past, Dogecoin has consistently broken out from long-term descending triangles shortly after a Bitcoin halving, leading to explosive price rallies. Kaleo‚Äôs chart shows DOGE‚Äôs past rallies from similar formations produced gains of over 20,000% in 2021 and 30,000% in 2027. Dogecoin‚Äôs price action currently mirrors these exact setups, suggesting that its price could be preparing for a historic move again. If history repeats, Kaleo has set DOGE‚Äôs long-term target at $6.9, representing a 3,530% increase from current levels around $0.19. Related Reading: Bitcoin Who? XRP Leads Coinbase Search Charts, Beating The Giants Interestingly, the analyst‚Äôs forecast comes just after a sharp daily crash saw Dogecoin drop about 60% at its lowest point. Market expert Kevin noted that the fall was too extreme to be retail-driven, hinting at systemic exchange failures across Binance, Coinbase, and Robinhood, which temporarily restricted buying during the dip.

Over the past year, he shut down its investment banking operations in Europe and the United States, exited retail markets in France and Argentina, and restructured the group to focus on two core regions, the UK and Hong Kong. In 2024, the bank earned $9.1 billion in pre-tax profit from Hong Kong, meaning 28% of its total, compared with $6.6 billion from the UK. HSBC consolidates Hong Kong operations Analysts have described the takeover as a ‚Äúlong overdue simplification‚Äù of the bank‚Äôs structure in its most profitable market. HSBC first bought a controlling stake in Hang Seng Bank in 1965 when a banking crisis hit Hong Kong. That cemented its position as a dominant local player, and this latest step is seen as an extension of that legacy. S&P Global analysts said, ‚ÄúHong Kong has long been HSBC Holdings‚Äô most profitable home market. We view the proposed transaction as a strategic redeployment of the substantial excess capital it is generating.‚Äù HSBC plans to use its surplus capital to privatize Hang Seng completely, which will eliminate the ‚Äòminority-interest deduction‚Äô ‚Äî an accounting adjustment that reduced HSBC‚Äôs capital buffer because it didn‚Äôt fully own the Hong Kong lender. Georges said, ‚ÄúThe ability to scale investments across both brands across the international network will be enhanced through this alignment. And it is more value generative for our shareholders than a share buyback.‚Äù However, not everyone was impressed. HSBC‚Äôs shares dropped more than 5% at the end of the week, hit by news that it will pause share buybacks until mid-2026. Property crisis adds risk to Hang Seng exposure Behind the financials lies a problem. Hang Seng Bank has ‚Äúclose to 4 million customers,‚Äù nearly all in Hong Kong, and is heavily tied to the local economy. Its core business is retail banking and lending to small and mid-sized firms, but it‚Äôs also exposed to Hong Kong‚Äôs property developers, many of whom are struggling as the city‚Äôs real estate market deteriorates. China‚Äôs property bubble burst in 2021, damaging some of the largest developers in Asia and dragging Hong Kong‚Äôs market along with it after the anti-National Security Law protests and Covid-era lockdowns. This year, Hang Seng‚Äôs pre-tax profits fell 28% to HK$8.1 billion, and its non-performing loan ratio hit 6.7%, which is the highest since 1998. The damage is visible in HSBC‚Äôs group reports. By June, 73% of its Hong Kong commercial real estate loans were listed as impaired or high-risk. According to the Financial Times, Eddie Yue, chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, responded that the city‚Äôs ‚Äúbanking system is well-capitalized and financially strong enough to withstand market volatilities.‚Äù Still, HSBC replaced Hang Seng‚Äôs top management, appointing Luanne Lim, a veteran of the group, as its new CEO. Analysts like Michael Makdad from Morningstar said, ‚Äú[The crisis] is HSBC‚Äôs responsibility; they need to take responsibility for it. If it were a choice between spinning off Hang Seng or taking 100 percent control, then that is what matches their strategy.‚Äù Industry veterans say the move was years in the making. ‚ÄúThis has been a long-term goal for HSBC and now it is more politically possible,‚Äù said one former financial executive. ‚ÄúNow it‚Äôs an easier time to gain control. This gets you the deposit base, and in dealing with the property market, it allows you to manage without minority friction.‚Äù Join Bybit now and claim a $50 bonus in minutes",Business|HSBC,EN,0,0,ASIA|FIAT|MARKET|BUSINESS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-11 20:36:50

Crypto news is dominated by extreme moves and liquidations. For those new to presales, strategy and timing are everything, not hype. The last few days show brutal cleanup in overextended positions, reminding us all that early advantage can be lost quickly. Although many people talk about ‚Äúmoonshots‚Äù, not everyone knows how to realise gains when the tide turns. MAGACOIN FINANCE presents a compelling case study, offering 13x upside from its presale to listing, with many analysts now projecting 50x+ beyond this. New investors can try to capture upside while managing risk before it‚Äôs too late, by using the three tips below. Tip 1: Stage your entry, don‚Äôt go all in When presales open it often feels like ‚Äúnow or never‚Äù. But savvy investors spread out their allocation through different stages. Presales usually work in tiers or chapters. The earlier chapters have lower entry prices. Subsequent chapters get more expensive. If you over-invest early on, the average price you pay could be quite high. And, if the price doesn‚Äôt really go up after the listing, you might end up making a loss. You maintain optionality by allocating portions of your capital to different stages of funding. If the project fails, your losses are capped but if it succeeds, your weighted average will still be good. This technique protects against new entrants‚Äô failures that cause zero or one success. Also, watch how fast each stage sells out. If the stages fill up quickly, it indicates a very high momentum, which in turn increases the chances of a sharp pullback listing. Tip 2: Use partial take-profit triggers around listing Presales come with ready tension: the price is low now and listed price will be higher later. However, spikes created by hype usually overshoot and then go down. To avoid being trapped in a dip, place partial profit take levels close to anticipated listing valuation. As an example, MAGACOIN FINANCE is currently priced at $0.00052564 in presale. Their confirmed listing price is $0.007. This means that MAGACOIN will see a 13x upside in price from presale to listing. This suggests that someone coming in shortly now, riding the listing, and not selling too early could see ~13x in the short-term. You would then multiply that further if the market rotates altcoins and we see some momentum. We can‚Äôt rely on luck, but rather discipline, timing and exit planning. According to several analysts, the first step will be a modest one. Between the presale and listing phases, extreme volatility often occurs, with many tokens experiencing a 10% to 30% pullback just before or after launch. Lock in some gains as the price approaches listing levels. You may remove 25‚Äì50% from the stock price at listing, leaving a portion riding for the longer term (e.g. 50√ó). This hybrid approach strikes a balance between safety and upside capture. Tip 3: Monitor liquidity and exchange listing signals Lack of liquidity is the most significant yet often overlooked risk in presales. If a token fails to get listed on major exchanges, it can stall. On the other hand, projects that secure Tier-1 exchange pledges tend to experience significant demand after listing. Is the project that is listing partners (Binance, Coinbase, KuCoin etc.) track announcements? Are there whitelist or listing guarantee slots? Are third-party integrations or bridge support in motion? Those signals often precede major price pumps. Keep an eye on wallet activity, token unlock schedule, and token vesting. The sudden release of tokens by the team or private investors right after listing can create downward selling pressure. If you encounter large vesting cliffs soon after listing, consider revisiting your take-profit plan. Aligning tips with market dynamics The three tips (staged entry, targeting profits and staying liquid) all align with how speculative capital flows during a reset. Capital allocation tends to flow into the infrastructure first and then, once the hype returns, into presale assets with clear stories. A project like MAGACOIN FINANCE is perfectly positioned for investors. When rotation returns, presale projects that have audited contracts, community momentum and plans to list will become magnets. It‚Äôs all about timing. If you‚Äôre too early, you‚Äôll end up wasting money for no good reason. If you‚Äôre too late, you‚Äôll miss out on profits. If you use these tactics that are based on discipline, you outsmart the risk/reward in your favor. This is especially a space where‚Ä¶ In these unstable, early stages of business, just having conviction without a strategy won‚Äôt make one a winner. One of the secrets to achieving extraordinary gains in the stock market is capital protection, which occurs in different stages. Here are three tactics investors can use to protect capital and position themselves to achieve outsized outcomes. MAGACOIN FINANCE shows the kind of structured presale where some analysts are whispering 13√ó initial return and many are eyeing 50√ó+ upside thereafter. You should use these techniques to smartly manoeuvre around the high-reward zone before it is too late.

Here‚Äôs the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-xrp-is-formally-integrated-into-eurosystem-heres-the-significance/,"A recent post by Crypto researcher, SMQKE, highlighted slides from Italian payments infrastructure provider SIA, asserting that Ripple is formally integrated into the Eurosystem through SIA‚Äôs involvement in ESMIG. The researcher presented this as documented evidence, while others disagreed, stating that SIA‚Äôs support for Ripple-enabled connectivity does not equate to official integration within Eurosystem frameworks. The key issue lies in distinguishing vendor capabilities from institutional implementation. Yes, Ripple is formally integrated into the Eurosystem through its strategic partnership with SIA, an Italian payment infrastructure provider. Documented. https://t.co/WvhpMLg46a pic.twitter.com/9tPx2cN2Dc ‚Äî SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) October 8, 2025 What the SIA Slides Show The first slide outlines SIA‚Äôs role in providing access to critical Eurosystem services through ESMIG. It confirms SIA as an infrastructure provider enabling connections to TARGET2, TIPS, T2S, and ECMS. SIA promotes a fully managed network under SIAnet, offering secure messaging and value-added services, such as validation and message translation. The second slide shifts focus to SIA Chain, their private blockchain and DLT infrastructure. Here, SIA explicitly lists support for multiple distributed ledger technologies, including Corda, Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, and Ripple. A visual diagram also includes Ripple within SIA‚Äôs interoperable network environment, indicating that SIA can interface with Ripple technology as part of its broader technical offerings. Assessing the Interpretation The presented slides confirm that SIA supports Ripple within its private DLT architecture. They also confirm SIA‚Äôs functional role as a connectivity provider to Eurosystem platforms. However, support for a DLT within a vendor‚Äôs network does not demonstrate adoption or integration by the Eurosystem itself. ESMIG, as documented publicly, is an interface standard operated by the Eurosystem for connecting to central banking services. There is no indication within these documents that Ripple is embedded within ESMIG or officially endorsed by the ECB or Eurosystem entities. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The comment challenging the original claim emphasized this distinction, noting that vendor connectivity options should not be confused with institutional usage. The slides do not show Ripple operating within ESMIG architecture; they show SIA offering broader interoperability options to clients that may include Ripple among other technologies. The materials shared offer evidence that SIA includes Ripple among supported DLT platforms within its private network infrastructure. They do not confirm that Ripple is formally integrated into the Eurosystem via ESMIG. Any assertion of official adoption would require documentation from Eurosystem authorities or explicit technical specifications naming Ripple within ESMIG standards. The current evidence reflects SIA‚Äôs interoperability capabilities, not institutional implementation. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

While overall trading volumes remain relatively subdued due to lower average prices, the number of transactions has surged sharply throughout 2025. From Slump to Surge In the first quarter, 7 million NFT sales were recorded, rising to 12.5 million in the second quarter. The momentum accelerated further in Q3, with over 18.1 million NFTs sold, representing a 45% jump from the previous quarter, and generating $1.6 billion in trading volume. Despite this surge in transaction counts, DappRadar stated that actual user adoption remains modest. The number of unique wallets trading NFTs rose from 1.66 million in Q1 to 2.14 million in Q3, a comparatively smaller increase than the spike in sales. This means that individual wallets are trading more NFTs on average, jumping from roughly 4.2 per wallet in Q1 to 8.4 in Q3, which indicates that existing participants are becoming more active rather than new users entering the market. Among NFT categories, gaming has been the notable laggard. DappRadar reported a 17% drop in trading volume and a steep 32% decline in the number of gaming-related NFT transactions over the past quarter. On the other hand, the sports NFT sector has seen an impressive revival, as trading volume of this cohort was up by 337% to $71 million while sales count soared 143% to 4.1 million. The surge is largely attributed to Sorare, the fantasy sports platform offering digital collectibles across football, basketball, and baseball. The platform‚Äôs success, buoyed by the launch of new sports seasons, has helped offset weakness in other sectors. Airdrops and OG NFTs The recent uptick can also be linked to strategic campaigns and revived interest in older projects. A major contributor has been OpenSea‚Äôs campaign ahead of its anticipated token launch, which rewarded active traders and incentivized frequent transactions. This initiative encouraged users to trade lower-value NFTs to qualify for rewards and boosted the platform‚Äôs overall activity. As a result, OpenSea‚Äôs sales count climbed 29% in Q3 to 9.27 million assets sold. Simultaneously, profile picture (PFP) collections have regained prominence, led by blue-chip projects like CryptoPunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), Moonbirds, and Pudgy Penguins. Trading volume for PFPs rose 187% quarter over quarter to $544 million, amidst renewed collector confidence. Adding to the resurgence, Yuga Labs streamlined its portfolio to focus on BAYC, Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC), and Otherside during the same period. Meanwhile, Moonbirds, now under Orange Cap Games, has emerged as Q3‚Äôs standout revival, recording 8,311 NFT sales worth $88 million, owing to the fresh momentum building around its upcoming BIRB token launch on Solana.

An Experienced Name Responds,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/can-we-say-the-bull-run-is-over-for-bitcoin-btc-after-the-latest-crash-an-experienced-name-responds/,"Cryptocurrency analyst Joao Wedson commented on whether the bull cycle in Bitcoin has ended following the recent market decline. Wedson stated that the 4-year Bitcoin cycle is still valid and that current price movements are largely in line with historical cycles. ‚ÄúSome investors are saying the 4-year BTC cycle is over due to global liquidity. However, the Recurrence Fractal Cycle chart, which has been highly accurate since 2015, shows that the cycle is still ongoing,‚Äù Wedson said in his statement. The analyst argued that the Max Intersect SMA Model developed by his team has accurately identified all Bitcoin peaks to date, saying, ‚ÄúIt's surprising that this model has accurately captured the ATH level in every cycle. The question is: Will it hit this cycle as well?‚Äù Related News: Chinese Analytics Firm Founder Reveals the 4 Main Reasons Behind Yesterday's Bitcoin and Altcoin Decline Wedson recalled the market deleveraging process that took place in 2021, reminding that Bitcoin soon rose to a new all-time high during the period when many altcoins reached their peaks. He also noted that on-chain data is still providing strong signals, and the recent major liquidation does not indicate that the market cycle is ending, but rather continuing. Some of the points Wedson makes are: There is no general enthusiasm in the market yet. Some metrics still suggest a new all-time high (ATH) is possible. The total value of the cryptocurrency market is even lower than Nvidia's market capitalization, meaning the sector still has growth potential. Mining fees and other on-chain data are at very low levels. Wedson concluded his statement with the following statements: ‚ÄúIt would be a mistake to think that the market ended solely because of a major liquidation. Historically, such moves have typically created bottoms. The resurgence of Bitcoin's dominance suggests the market could continue for some time, perhaps just a month or so.‚Äù *This is not investment advice.

Before this decline, the crypto market leader led a strong rally to set a new all-time high of $126,198.17 on October 6, 2025. Interestingly, recent data on the Bitcoin Options market indicated a wave of cautious positioning among institutional investors amid this price surge ahead of the current market downturn. Institutions Step Back As Bitcoin‚Äôs Rally Turns Euphoric ‚Äì Glassnode In an X post on October 10, blockchain analytics firm Glassnode lays out some interesting insights in its weekly options market update. Notably, Glassnode analysts report that while Bitcoin prices surged more than 10% in the recent ascent to a new all-time high, institutional traders appear to have maintained a calm market approach, opting to lock in profits and protect downside rather than chase the rally.Despite the steep move higher, implied volatility, i.e., a gauge of expected price swings, barely budged, hovering around 38‚Äì40%. Normally, a rally of that size would push volatility higher as traders hurriedly call and amplify their exposure. However, the silent reaction suggests composure from institutional investors who were already positioned for the move or simply unwilling to pay up for additional upside. Glassnode analysts also draw attention to another subtle but telling sign in option skew. Even at the height of the rally, demand for put options remained strong, keeping the market elevated. This indicates that many large players were selling calls, effectively capping potential upside, through the options market, while maintaining insurance in case the market reversed.In addition, the put-call ratio also reinforces this cautious pattern among institutions. Amidst the option expiry on Friday, October 9, the ratio climbed above 1.0, indicating more puts traded than calls as traders were busy hedging positions ahead of the current downturn rather than chasing momentum and locking in recent gains. Generally, Glassnode describes the Bitcoin market as having adopted a different behavior this cycle, driven by institutional discipline rather than surging volatility and retail exuberance as seen in previous cycles. The dominance of institutional funding driven by spot ETFs and the recent advent of crypto treasury companies may have added a thick layer of maturity to the $2 trillion market. BTC Market Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $110,805 after a 7.54% decline in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, daily trading volume has surged 150.37%, indicating a rise in market activity as traders react to the sharp pullback.",Bitcoin|bitcoin options|Glassnode|implied volatility|Institutions|Spot ETFs,EN,0,0,MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-11 21:30:37

A whale wallet trading on decentralized derivatives exchange Hyperliquid deposited approximately $160 million worth of USDC, opening $1.1 billion in leveraged short positions on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), according to reports. These trades reportedly occurred approximately 30 minutes before US President Donald Trump announced 100% tariffs on China on October 10. The positions in question were allegedly later closed, generating a profit of approximately $190 million to $200 million. However, there is no definitive evidence of insider trading. Related News: Can We Say the Bull Run Is Over for Bitcoin (BTC) After the Latest Crash? An Experienced Name Responds According to data shared by YouTuber and researcher Coffeezilla, the whale opened its last short position, worth approximately $23 million, at 11:49 PM UTC on October 10th. Exactly one minute later, President Trump's statement threatening 100% tariffs on China followed. This announcement triggered the largest liquidation wave in the crypto market in years. Some have claimed that the Trump family profited $192 million from these transactions, but there is no substantiated evidence to support this claim. *This is not investment advice.

Since the dump, crypto natives have been looking for answers, and a common theme has been suspicion of centralized exchanges. Stakeholders and commentators have linked the recent volatility to broader financial market jitters, not unlike the sell-off that rocked US stock markets. However, the speed and scale of the impact on the crypto market have amplified suspicion. Crypto markets endured what is being considered the largest liquidation event in history. Source: Coinglass Speculations on what caused the crash ‚ÄúWord on the street is that big CEX‚Äôs auto liquidation of collateral tied to cross margined positions is why lots of alts got smoked on the move down,‚Äù Arthur Hayes wrote on X. ‚ÄúCongrats to all you stink bidders. We won‚Äôt be seeing those levels any time soon on many high quality alts.‚Äù Another influencer referred to an event that Cryptopolitan reported on Friday , when a whale opened short positions on BTC and ETH two days ahead of the market bloodbath. The wheels were finally set in motion after Trump‚Äôs declaration on October 10, but the market only dipped slightly; nothing too major. Then, a few hours later, a podium announcement seemingly declared trade war on China, causing panic. ‚ÄúStarting November 1, the United States will impose a 100% tariff on all Chinese imports,‚Äù the declaration said and within minutes, the S&P 500 dropped over 2%, Bitcoin plunged to $104K, Ethereum crashed to $3,574 and altcoins bled 60‚Äì90%, all culminating in almost $1T in crypto market cap wiped in under 3 hours. The influencer noted how suspicious the timing was; Thirty minutes before Trump made the official announcement, the same whale doubled its short exposure, and when the crash hit, those positions were closed for an estimated $200M profit. ‚ÄúToo perfect to be a coincidence,‚Äù wrote the influencer, who remains convinced that this value extraction would not start a bear market. According to him, it was a purge, and that is characteristic of bull markets ‚Äî just before they move up another massive leg. While Trump‚Äôs tariffs may have triggered the cascade, what comes now could fuel the next expansion or kill it. Other theories circulating on the internet are linked to insider trading and ‚Äúengineered liquidations‚Äù fueled by on-chain data, and political timing. For now, these claims are more speculative than proven, but they echo the long-standing factors like thin liquidity and whale dominance that made some steer clear of crypto in the early days. Are we in a bear market? First off, it should be noted that the present circumstances do not fit the criteria of past bear markets. However, immature reactions could trigger bearish continuity, threatening past gains. The volatility was triggered in large part by the latest round of tariffs from US President Donald Trump, only days after BTC made a new all-time high. Trump announced on Friday that he would impose an additional 100% tariff on China and export controls on software, causing prices to tumble at a time the market was already showing weakness. Bitcoin , which had touched above $125,000 earlier this week, dipped as low as $104,000 on Saturday before hovering around $112,000 as of publication time. The fall may not look like much, but over the past 24 hours, over $19 billion worth of bets were wiped out, and more than 1.6 million traders got liquidated, according to Coinglass data. More than $7 billion of those positions were reportedly closed in less than an hour of trading on Friday. Coinglass suspects the total might be much higher since exchanges don‚Äôt necessarily report such orders in real time. Binance, for example, only reports one liquidation order per second, the post claims. ‚ÄúThe focus now turns to counterparty exposure and whether this triggers broader market contagion,‚Äù said Brian Strugats, head trader at Multicoin Capital, before adding that some estimates place total liquidations above $30 billion.

With Binance, there were delays and system strains. Now that the dust has settled, the exchange has voluntarily promised to compensate users for the disruption, particularly focusing on issues related to the stablecoin USDe and staking tokens BNSOL and WBETH. Binance commits to making affected traders whole In response to the disaster that hit the market between October 10 and 11, Binance co-founder and Chief Customer Service Officer Yi He has issued a public apology via X (formerly Twitter). She announced the exchange‚Äôs plans to compensate users whose losses were directly attributable to platform issues, rather than normal market fluctuations. ‚ÄúBinance will handle the issues related to Binance,‚Äù she wrote , while emphasizing that there would be no compensation for ‚Äúpersonal trading losses caused by price fluctuations or unrealized losses.‚Äù Teng‚Äôs message was more heartfelt, beginning with an acknowledgment of the turbulent past day and an apology to those impacted. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt make excuses ‚Äî we listen closely, learn from what happened, and are committed to doing better,‚Äù he added . ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre still experiencing any unresolved issues, please reach out to our Binance Support team. Every case will be handled with the care and attention it deserves, and compensation will be provided where applicable.‚Äù Teng ended the message by pointing out that volatility is a part of the market, encouraging users to stay informed and cautious during these times. What happened to Binance during the mayhem? As earlier stated, Binance experienced significant platform strain during the period of extreme market volatility that caused delays in order execution, API latency spikes, and display issues for users‚Äîparticularly impacting staking products, stablecoins, and futures trading. The unprecedented trading volumes led to a massive liquidation cascade across the crypto sector, wiping out approximately $19.3 billion in leveraged positions globally and affecting more than a million traders. The Binance platform was one of the hardest hit, as it accounted for about $2.3 billion of the total liquidations. Its native token was not spared either; the volatility influenced rapid market movements, leading to an almost 10% dump in BNB. So far, only Binance has mentioned anything about compensation; while the general consensus on the timeline was that there was strain during the thick of it, no other exchange has acknowledged it. On October 11, the founder and CEO of OKX took to X with a message that read: ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs market fluctuations, OKX‚Äôs global risk control system has operated stably, with the platform maintaining smooth and steady performance across all regions, and all system indicators remaining at normal levels. OKX will continue to provide stable and reliable services to global users 7√ó24 hours.‚Äù Traders sharing their experiences on X do not agree with the executive, though, as impacted traders demanded investigations, alleging CEX manipulation and demanding lawsuits against non-responsive exchanges. Arthur Hayes also implied that there was more to the liquidations other than market volatility, while Crypto.com‚Äôs CEO called for regulators to look into the events of the day, as Cryptopolitan reported.

Perpetual futures ‚Äî ‚Äúperps‚Äù in trading shorthand ‚Äî are cash-settled contracts with no expiry that mirror spot via funding payments, not delivery. Profits and losses net against a shared margin pool rather than shipped coins, which is why, in stress, venues may need to reallocate exposure quickly to keep books balanced. Colkitt frames ADL as the last step in a risk waterfall. In normal conditions, a blown-up account is liquidated into the order book near its bankruptcy price. If slippage is too severe, venues lean on whatever buffers they maintain ‚Äî insurance funds, programmatic liquidity, or vaults dedicated to absorbing distressed flow. Colkitt notes that such vaults can be lucrative during turmoil because they buy at deep discounts and sell into sharp rebounds; he points to an hour during Friday's crypto meltdown when Hyperliquid‚Äôs vault booked about $40 million. The point, he stresses, is that a vault is not magic. It follows the same rules as any participant and has finite risk capacity. When those defenses are exhausted and a shortfall still remains, the mechanism that preserves solvency is ADL. The analogies in Colkitt‚Äôs explainer make the logic intuitive. He likens the process to an overbooked flight: the airline raises incentives to find volunteers, but if no one bites, ‚Äúsomeone has to be kicked off the plane.‚Äù In perps, when bids and buffers will not absorb the loss, ADL ‚Äúbumps‚Äù part of profitable positions so the market can depart on time and settle obligations. He also reaches for the card room. A player on a hot streak can win table after table until the room effectively runs out of chips; trimming the winner is not punishment, it is how the house keeps the game running when the other side cannot pay. How the queue works When ADL triggers, exchanges apply a rule to decide who gets reduced first. Colkitt describes a queue that blends three factors: unrealized profit, effective leverage, and position size. That math typically pushes large, highly profitable, highly leveraged accounts to the front of the line‚Äî‚Äúthe biggest, most profitable whales get sent home first,‚Äù as he puts it. Reductions are assigned at preset prices tied to the bankrupt side and continue only until the deficit is absorbed. Once the gap closes, normal trading resumes. Traders bristle because ADL can clip a correct position at peak momentum and outside normal execution flow. Colkitt acknowledges the frustration but argues the necessity is structural. Perp markets are zero sum. There is no warehouse of real bitcoin or ether behind a contract, only cash claims moving between longs and shorts. In his words, it is ‚Äújust a big boring pile of cash.‚Äù If a liquidation cannot clear at or above the bankruptcy price and buffers are spent, the venue must rebalance instantly to avoid bad debt and cascading failures. Colkitt emphasizes that ADL should be rare, and most days it is. Standard liquidations and buffers usually do the job, allowing profitable trades to exit on their own terms. The existence of ADL, however, is part of the compact that lets venues offer non-expiring, high-leverage exposure without promising an ‚Äúinfinite stream of losers on the other side.‚Äù It is the final line in the rulebook that keeps the synthetic mirror of spot from cracking under stress. He also argues that ADL exposes the scaffolding that typically stays hidden. Perps build a convincing simulation of the underlying market, but extreme tapes test the illusion. The ‚Äúedge of the simulation‚Äù is when the platform must reveal its accounting and forcibly redistribute exposure to keep parity with spot and stop a cascade. In practice, that means a transparent queue, published parameters, and, increasingly, on-screen indicators that show accounts where they sit in the line. Colkitt‚Äôs broader message is pragmatic. No mechanism can guarantee painless unwinds, only predictable ones. The reason ADL provokes strong reactions is that it strikes winners, not losers, and often at the most visible moment of success. The reason it persists is that it is the only step left once markets refuse to clear and buffers run dry. For now, exchanges are betting that clear rules, visible queues and thicker buffers keep ADL what it should be ‚Äî a backstop you rarely see but never ignore.",Markets|perpetual contracts|Crypto|News,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-10-11 21:58:55

Whales came in at the $0.25 support point, easing the fall, while retail investors debated whether to buy the dip or wait for clearer trends. Amid this volatility, another crypto went under the radar and silently attracted the attention of savvy investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , now valued at a mere $0.035, has already raised over $17.1 million from over 16,840 investors in its presale. Mutuum Finance combines real-world usability and the type of growth potential that can provide 25x returns. Dogecoin Dips 8% as Whales Step In, Support Holds Near $0.25 Dogecoin (DOGE) fell 8% on Tuesday as whales sold into $0.27 resistance, which caused a billion-token liquidation wave but saw late-session buying near $0.25 suggest a potential technical floor.

Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Source: Coinmarketcap Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth¬†with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana‚Äôs (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150. In May the price continued to rise and ended the month above the $165 price level, a trend that could not extend through June as the month saw a decline falling below the $150 price level to end the month. July saw a sharp rise to the asset‚Äôs volatility with SOL crossing the $200 mark. However, the price could not be maintained and SOL ended the month below the $180 level. In August, on the other hand, SOL made strides and managed to close the month above the $205 mark. In September, the volatility rose sharply as the price rose to the $250 price level but failed to maintain the level and ended the month at $230.",Crypto Price Predictions|Solana,EN,0,0,SOL|TRADING|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-11 22:00:00

Chart Signals Move To New All-Time High,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoins-pullback-healthy/,"Bitcoin appears to be quietly gathering strength beneath the surface. After a healthy pullback that shook out weak hands, the market is showing signs of renewed momentum. Key technical signals suggest this correction may have been a setup for the next major rally, potentially paving the way for a new all-time high. Healthy Correction Within A Dominant Uptrend EtherNasyonaL, in a recent post, highlighted that Bitcoin continues to maintain its upward trajectory despite recent market fluctuations. The analyst described the latest movement as a healthy correction within the broader bullish trend, emphasizing that such retracements are natural in a sustained rally. Related Reading: Bitcoin Pauses Below Key Levels ‚Äì Can It Regain Momentum For A Rally? Following a rejection from the supply zone, Bitcoin found strong support at a key demand area, where buyers quickly stepped in to defend the price. This rebound underscores the underlying strength of market participants and reaffirms that bullish sentiment remains dominant. EtherNasyonaL¬†noted that short-term volatility, for traders not involved in leveraged positions, often appears as noise in the bigger picture. BTC‚Äôs macro trend is still positive, and the ongoing correction may simply serve as fuel for the next leg higher. Overall, Bitcoin‚Äôs structure remains solid, with its trend intact and momentum still alive. Bullish Spring Formation Points To Possible Breakout Setup Crypto analyst Christopher Inks, in an X post, noted that Bitcoin‚Äôs latest price action has refined its trading range, offering a clearer market structure. He suggested that the asset may have just formed a heavy spring or bullish Swing Failure Pattern (SFP), a setup that often precedes strong upward movement. Related Reading: Here‚Äôs Why The Bitcoin Price Crashed After Hitting $125,700 All-Time High If this bullish setup holds, the analyst expects a validation phase, where Bitcoin could form a higher low on lower volume, a classic sign of successful testing. Such a move would confirm the spring‚Äôs strength and potentially trigger momentum toward a new all-time high (ATH). This phase is critical in determining whether the next major rally is about to begin. Inks also pointed to Open Interest (OI) as a key confirmation tool. A decline in open interest as price consolidates would suggest short covering and validate the bullish test. On the other hand, rising OI on lower closes would imply continued distribution, signaling that the market may need more time before reversing decisively. From an Elliott Wave Theory (EWT) perspective, Inks identified a three-wave structure from the swing low while printing a new swing high that fits a flat correction pattern. Since flat corrections often occur before the continuation of a larger uptrend, this analysis aligns with the Wyckoff interpretation, suggesting Bitcoin‚Äôs structure remains strong and poised for another upward leg.

The decision came after China announced restrictions on rare earth minerals, crucial for technology and manufacturing. BTC plunged as low as $104,000 on some exchanges, with the drop liquidating $6 billion in positions in one hour. The reversal has significantly impacted investor sentiment and market optimism. Bitcoin Traders Must Brace For Volatility Swan Bitcoin CEO Cory Klippsten believes Bitcoin could face substantial volatility as trade tensions between the US and China escalated dramatically. Trump announced 100% tariffs on Chinese imports after the latter announced restrictions on rare earth minerals. ‚ÄúIf the broader risk-off mood holds, Bitcoin can get dragged around a bit before it finds support and starts to decouple again.‚Äù Klippsten added that Bitcoin traders should expect volatility over the next few days as leveraged traders will get flushed out. ‚ÄúMacro-driven dips like this usually wash out leveraged traders and weak hands, then reset positioning for the next leg up.‚Äù Over 2.19 billion in Bitcoin long positions were wiped out over the past 24 hours, adding to a total of over $8 billion in liquidations across the crypto market. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got a little panic in the markets right now, classic macro whiplash. Trump and China are trading tariff threats, equities are off, and traders are scrambling to derisk.‚Äù Despite the market bloodbath, Bitcoin analysts remain optimistic and believe the latest price drop presents a buying opportunity. Bitwise Invest strategist Juan Leon stated, ‚ÄúThe best time to buy BTC has tended to be when it is being dragged down by broader markets.‚Äù Morgan Stanley Drops Restrictions On Crypto Morgan Stanley is reportedly expanding its crypto offerings to allow all its clients to access digital assets. According to reports, the bank will allow customers to trade Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana via its eTrade platform. Advisors will be able to offer customers crypto fund investments, including those with retirement accounts. Previously, only the bank‚Äôs high-net-worth clients could invest in crypto. Morgan Stanley has slowly made inroads into the digital asset space. It began offering wealthy clients access to Bitcoin investment funds in 2021 and allowed financial advisors to promote Bitcoin ETFs to clients in 2024. This year, Morgan Stanley CEO and Chairman Ted Pick stated in an interview that the bank will work with regulators to offer clients access to crypto. ‚ÄúFor us, the equation is really around whether we, as a highly regulated financial institution, can act as transactors.‚Äù The bank also confirmed a partnership with crypto and stablecoin infrastructure fund Zerohash to allow customers to trade Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) fell as the broader cryptocurrency market endured a bloodbath after President Trump imposed 100% tariffs on China in a dramatic escalation of the trade war between the two countries. Trump also imposed import controls on ‚Äúany critical software‚Äù after China announced export restrictions on rare earth minerals critical to tech and other manufacturing. Markets went into turmoil following the announcement, with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and other cryptocurrencies plunging deep into the red. BTC fell as low as $102,000 on Binance before recovering and closing the day at $112,980. President Trump stated on Truth Social, ‚ÄúIt has just been learned that China has taken an extraordinarily aggressive position on Trade in sending an extremely hostile letter to the World, stating that they were going to, effective November 1, 2025, impose large-scale Export Controls on virtually every product they make.‚Äù BTC plunged shortly after the announcement, with analysts worried about a plunge below $100,000. The price stabilized around $102,000, its lowest level since June. Meanwhile, data from CoinGlass revealed that over $9.4 billion in crypto market positions were liquidated in the past 24 hours, with $7.15 billion being leveraged long positions. Ravi Doshi, co-head of markets at FalconX, stated, ‚ÄúA renewed trade war between China and the US erupted on Friday, causing uncertainty in markets and a rout in risk assets.‚Äù Rare earth elements are crucial for semiconductor production. China‚Äôs threat to tighten access to critical materials could strain global supply chains for AI, high-performance computing, and crypto mining infrastructure. The market crash has wiped out ‚ÄúUptober‚Äù euphoria, with the crypto market cap shedding nearly 10% in 24 hours.

Gasparino stated on X, ‚ÄúPeople close to CZ, the former Binance chief ... say discussions inside the White House are heating up on the possibility of a pardon from. Many Trump insiders believe the fraud case against [CZ] was pretty weak, and certainly not something that merited a felony conviction and jail time.‚Äù Zhao was one of the most influential figures in the crypto ecosystem. He was convicted of money laundering by the US Department of Justice, served time, and paid $4.3 billion in fines. Zhao remains the largest individual shareholder at Binance, and a presidential pardon could clear the way for a formal return to the exchange he founded in 2017. Trump Leaning Towards Pardon President Trump and several officials in the White House believe the case against Zhao under the previous administration‚Äôs crypto crackdown was weak and did not merit prison time or felony charges. Gasparino stated that Trump is leaning towards a pardon, but the administration is worried about the optics of a pardon to Zhao, given the president‚Äôs involvement in the digital asset space. The Trump family is deeply involved with various crypto projects through their company, World Liberty Financial. Zhao had revealed in May that he had applied for a pardon from President Trump following his release from prison. However, according to reports, Zhao was denied a pardon at that time. Zhao‚Äôs Conviction Zhao‚Äôs conviction marked the end of one of the most high-profile cases during the Biden administration‚Äôs war on crypto. Prosecutors alleged Binance allowed illicit transactions with sanctioned entities and failed to implement anti-money laundering controls. Zhao pleaded guilty to the charges and stepped down as the CEO of Binance. He also paid $50 million in fines, while Binance paid $4.3 billion. Zhao served a four-month prison sentence in a low-security federal prison in California and in a halfway house. Several individuals have questioned whether the charges against Zhao were warranted. Meanwhile, Trump‚Äôs team sees Zhao‚Äôs situation as an opportunity to demonstrate a new era of crypto policy. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The company, which remains privately held and secretive about its finances, has built a reputation for spending other people‚Äôs money faster and louder than any tech giant has ever done before. According to CNBC, its expansion up and down the stack (from massive data centers to coding tools and consumer devices) has left the startup scene struggling to find breathing space. In less than three years, OpenAI has gone from a startup led by ex‚ÄìY Combinator head Sam Altman to a $500 billion heavyweight. It is now building data centers approved by the White House and teaming with Nvidia, the world‚Äôs most valuable company. OpenAI‚Äôs flagship ChatGPT chatbot now serves 800 million users every week, while its new Sora video app hit one million downloads in under five days. At DevDay in San Francisco, attended by around 1,500 developers, Sam announced that Codex, the company‚Äôs software engineering agent, is now fully available, and Sora 2 can be accessed through the API. Investors chase niches as OpenAI dominates every lane Nina Achadjian, a partner at Index Ventures, said the biggest question for entrepreneurs is, ‚ÄúWhere is the white space?‚Äù Her firm just led a $25 million round in Quilter, a startup using AI for printed circuit boards, founded in 2019 by ex-SpaceX engineer Sergiy Nesterenko. Nina described the company as ‚Äúpretty niche‚Äù and ‚Äúnot built on top of any model.‚Äù She explained that OpenAI probably won‚Äôt compete in such a deep engineering space dominated by firms like Cadence Design and Synopsys, but still, ‚Äúthere is no predictability,‚Äù she said. Relative to past cycles, ‚Äúit‚Äôs more opaque and hard to predict which direction those guys are going to go.‚Äù At DevDay, Sam appeared on stage with Jony Ive, the designer behind the iPhone, who joined OpenAI in May as part of a $6.4 billion talent deal to build AI hardware. Jony said his goal was to create tools that ‚Äúmake us happy and fulfilled and more peaceful and less anxious and less disconnected.‚Äù He refused to say what exactly he was building. Still, the company‚Äôs nonstop expansion has made it the center of the AI world, much like Amazon in e-commerce, Google in search, Facebook in social media, and Apple in mobile. Ethan Kurzweil, managing partner at Chemistry Ventures, said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the fastest-moving time in startup creation and disruption in my 17 years of investing.‚Äù He said OpenAI is rolling out services that compete directly with tools built on top of ChatGPT, and even that hasn‚Äôt slowed investment. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a gold rush mentality where a lot of companies will do well,‚Äù he said. AI cash floods the market as moats disappear At a September event hosted by Chemistry, OpenAI‚Äôs COO Brad Lightcap told attendees there are no ‚Äútechnical moats‚Äù anymore. Competing models from Anthropic, Google, and Meta prove the fight is about momentum, not technology. Index Ventures‚Äô Nina said the lack of public oversight gives OpenAI and Anthropic freedom to burn through cash. Anthropic raised $13 billion last month at a $183 billion valuation. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no reckoning, because none of the companies are public,‚Äù she said . ‚ÄúThat further fosters the exuberance of capital raising, capital spending and vertical integration. In the first half of 2025, venture capital growth-stage funding reached $83.9 billion, driven by five billion-dollar AI deals. On that pace, 2025 will surpass 2021‚Äôs record $96.1 billion. ‚ÄúAI continues to dominate the upper end of the deal spectrum,‚Äù said a report from Pitchbook and the National Venture Capital Association. Meanwhile, Exa Labs, founded in 2021, raised $85 million in September at a $700 million valuation from investors including Nvidia. Exa co-founder Jeff Wang said that hobbyists and people building AI products are paying for Exa‚Äôs service, and that it‚Äôs being used within companies that have specific and ‚Äúgigantic needs.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe pie is really big and OpenAI is just one company,‚Äù Jeff said.

Marszalek has taken to X and voiced his opinion about the widespread liquidations, which surpassed previous market crashes, including the one caused by FTX. Regulators should probe crypto exchanges He wrote, ‚ÄúRegulators should look into the exchanges that had most liquidations in the last 24h and conduct a thorough review of fairness of practices.‚Äù Marszalek is concerned that some exchanges failed to treat traders fairly, mispriced assets, or prevented withdrawal requests. Cryptopolitan reported that some centralized exchanges faced major congestion during market liquidation. That led to widespread technical issues resulting in frozen apps and stuck order books. Some people were even locked out of their accounts during market turbulence, causing huge losses. Moreover, Marszalek questioned whether exchanges have a robust setup to monitor trades and if there are any anti-money laundering (AML) programmes in place. He voiced his concerns and said, ‚Äú$20B in liquidations, a lot of users got hurt. The job of regulatory bodies is to protect the consumers and assure market integrity. Hyperliquid faced the biggest liquidations of $10.31 billion. ByBit and Binance ranked second and third with $4.65 billion and $2.41 billion being wiped out, respectively. OKX saw liquidations of $1.21 billion, while HTX and Gate traders lost $362.5 million and $264.5 million, respectively, based on aggregated data from CoinGlass. On the other hand, DeFi platforms passed the stress test with flying colors. Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) such as Uniswap and Aave handled the market turbulence with zero technical issues and no interruptions. Aave handled $180 million in liquidations flawlessly and without any human intervention, while Uniswap processed close to $9 billion in trades as reported by Cryptopolitan. The crypto market sentiment is labeled ‚ÄúFear‚Äù as of October 11. Bitcoin is trading at $110,988 while Ethereum is hovering around $3,733.05 based on CoinGecko data . Despite the major liquidation, privacy coins are still trending up by 2.4% with Zcash trading at $287.50 while Monero is about to reach $300.

The October 10 crash, triggered by renewed trade tensions between Washington and Beijing, sent shockwaves through both traditional and digital markets. Analysts say the downturn tested the resilience of the sector‚Äôs liquidity systems but has also sparked a quick rebound in on-chain activity. Investors buy the dip as Tether, Circle mint new stablecoins Data from on-chain analytics platform Lookonchain showed that Tether and Circle, issuers of USDT and USDC, respectively, minted a combined $1.75 billion in new stablecoins in the immediate aftermath of the crash. In a post on X, the analytics firm said the new issuance reflected ‚Äúliquidity injection‚Äù as investors repositioned into dollar-pegged assets during the sell-off. Not everyone was retreating. Blockchain analytics also revealed that Bitmine, one of the sector‚Äôs largest digital asset investors, bought 27,256 ETH, worth around $104.24 million, during the downturn. The purchase came as part of what market observers describe as bottom-fishing by whales seeking discounted assets ahead of a possible rebound. Bitmine( @BitMNR ) just bought another 27,256 $ETH (104.24M). Tom Lee said that today's dip was a good shakeout and the market is likely to rise in a week. https://t.co/RT53NaLoMF https://t.co/qlNEWX7DLQ pic.twitter.com/4Ighq8PpX6 ‚Äî Lookonchain (@lookonchain) October 11, 2025 Tom Lee, Wall Street strategist and Head of Research at Fundstrat, shared his insights on the current state of the market and how investors will likely react, calling the event ‚Äúa good shakeout,‚Äù and adding that the market was likely to rise in a week. Andrei Grachev, managing partner at DWF Labs, shares similar sentiments. He described the crash as the product of technical liquidations rather than a collapse in fundamentals. ‚ÄúThis crash happened not because of fundamentals like the FTX collapse,‚Äù Grachev wrote on X . ‚ÄúIt was because of the tariffs announcement and following leveraged liquidations. Liquidity got drained, but Bitcoin and strong projects should recover quite soon. DYOR .‚Äù The journey to recovery The speed of the post-crash adjustments shows how much more automated and liquid the crypto ecosystem has become since the major market disruptions of 2022. Within hours of the sell-off, stablecoin supplies expanded, liquidity pools rebalanced, and DeFi protocols such as Aave and Uniswap reported record transaction volumes with minimal downtime . Analysts say that if the market stabilizes in the coming days, this episode may be remembered less as a crash than as a liquidity test, one that key crypto institutions appeared ready to pass. However, if macroeconomic tensions escalate with Trump making another decision that sends panic into the market or a major liquidity crunch hits the stablecoin market, the recovery could stall. Lee also pointed out, as he said, ‚ÄúUnless there‚Äôs a real structural change, this pullback is a buying opportunity.‚Äù So far, the tone across the crypto sector is shifting from fear to measured optimism, and as Grachev noted, the turbulence may have been a test rather than a reckoning; ‚ÄúBitcoin and strong projects should recover quite soon.‚Äù Want your project in front of crypto‚Äôs top minds?

The policy, set to take effect on November 1 , rattled investors globally and unleashed the most severe wave of crypto liquidations seen in years. The fallout was immediate. Within hours, the crypto market shed more than $200 billion in value, with leveraged positions collapsing across major exchanges. Bitcoin (BTC) plunged below $106,000 before recovering to $112,000 , while Ethereum (ETH) rebounded from $3,500 to $3,800 after intense panic selling. Meanwhile, XRP and Solana (SOL) fell 13.5% and 16.1% , respectively, as liquidity evaporated. According to data, over $19.3 billion worth of leveraged positions were liquidated within 24 hours, impacting more than 1.6 million traders . Analysts described the event as ‚Äúpanic-driven,‚Äù spurred by fears of a prolonged U.S. ‚Äì China trade war that could reshape capital flows for the rest of 2025. Despite the carnage, key altcoins have begun to show remarkable resilience, particularly in sectors that blend utility with cultural momentum. Among them, MemeCore and MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out as bright spots in an otherwise battered market. MAGACOIN FINANCE Emerges as a Post-Crash Power Player Amid the chaos, MAGACOIN FINANCE has drawn growing attention for its strength, structure, and staying power. While many tokens struggled to maintain visibility during the crash, MAGACOIN FINANCE continued building momentum through its $16 million+ presale milestone, HashEx and CertiK audits, and scarcity-driven tokenomics. Its community presence on X and Telegram remains one of the most active in the altcoin space, providing consistent visibility even as markets turned red. Analysts projecting 50√ó upside potential say that MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a strategic accumulation target for investors seeking growth exposure without overleveraging. What makes MAGACOIN FINANCE notable in this cycle is its contrast to speculative meme assets, it blends cultural relevance with audit-backed credibility , bridging a gap that has long divided crypto retail enthusiasm from institutional confidence. As capital rotates from short-term trades to projects with stronger foundations, MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äôs clear roadmap and token structure position it as a natural beneficiary of post-crash capital reallocation. Market watchers note that volatility tends to accelerate the discovery of quality projects. In that context, MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äôs continued growth during one of the worst crashes in crypto history signals that it‚Äôs not merely surviving turbulence, it‚Äôs thriving within it. MemeCore Defies Market Panic with Proof-of-Meme Innovation While nearly every token posted double-digit losses, MemeCore (MEME) shocked analysts by gaining 7.87% in 24 hours and 6.07% on the week , defying the selloff. Trading volume more than doubled to $39.8 million , even as broader liquidity dried up. The project‚Äôs strength comes from its Proof-of-Meme (PoM) consensus mechanism, a creative spin on blockchain validation that rewards community engagement and meme-driven activity rather than traditional staking or mining. This innovation, paired with EVM compatibility , attracted retail traders seeking stability within a familiar Layer 1 ecosystem. MemeCore‚Äôs total market cap has now reached $2.32 billion , cementing it as one of the top-performing Layer 1s of 2025. The upcoming MemeX Festival on October 15 is also generating excitement, as it promises to showcase a wave of new meme-based applications and NFT integrations built on the platform. Analysts at CoinMarketCap‚Äôs momentum desk note that MemeCore‚Äôs performance highlights an emerging pattern: in moments of macro fear, traders are shifting from high-beta DeFi and AI tokens toward community-led, culturally resilient ecosystems . However, experts caution that the project‚Äôs relatively low liquidity compared to its market cap could amplify volatility during sharp market moves. Even with that caveat, MemeCore‚Äôs ability to rally during the sharpest market drop of 2025 underscores its growing role as a niche safe haven for retail sentiment. The Road Ahead: From Capitulation to Confidence This week‚Äôs $20 billion liquidation was a harsh reminder of crypto‚Äôs vulnerability to macro shocks. Yet, as seen in prior cycles, these events often serve as catalysts for renewal. Institutional buying near Bitcoin‚Äôs lows suggests that large players are treating this panic as an accumulation opportunity. Meanwhile, resilient altcoins like MemeCore and MAGACOIN FINANCE are capturing the imagination of retail investors seeking both innovation and stability. With the market rebounding from the brink, the coming weeks will test whether these altcoins can sustain their momentum amid geopolitical uncertainty. If they can, both MemeCore‚Äôs cultural narrative and MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äôs scarcity-backed framework may define the recovery phase leading into 2026.

According to his assessment, XRP could serve as a foundation for a new upward movement as liquidity shifts across global financial markets. Rietveld explained that the stock market is currently setting new all-time highs, while the crypto market undergoes a temporary correction. He observed that this pattern has occurred before, most notably earlier in the year, when a surge followed rising equity markets in cryptocurrency valuations. In his view, the present setup mirrors those conditions, suggesting that capital from traditional assets could soon flow into the digital asset space. The MOST Important #XRP Video You Will Ever Watch! pic.twitter.com/W0wh6RxBa9 ‚Äî Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) October 9, 2025 XRP Positioned for Market Rebound Rietveld maintained that XRP‚Äôs market structure indicates growing strength, particularly as it continues to hold above long-term support zones . He expects that the next wave of liquidity entering the crypto market will likely benefit assets such as XRP, which he considers well-positioned for the next stage of growth. His outlook remains optimistic, supported by the ongoing increase in institutional participation and the gradual recovery of investor sentiment following recent corrections. He further noted that as market cycles repeat, patience and awareness of key technical zones are essential. The current phase, he argued, offers investors an opportunity to accumulate at attractive prices before broader market momentum resumes. He pointed out that the cyclical flow of capital, which moves from traditional stocks to digital assets, has consistently preceded bullish phases in cryptocurrency. Institutional Adoption Accelerating Rietveld highlighted a growing trend among institutional investors who are increasing their exposure to digital assets. He cited recent reports showing that over 60% of institutional investors plan to acquire more cryptocurrency in the near term, viewing it as a hedge against the weakening fiat system. He also referenced Luxembourg‚Äôs sovereign wealth fund, which recently allocated one percent of its portfolio to spot Bitcoin ETFs, as an example of major financial institutions entering the space with long-term confidence. He described this move as a sign of broader acceptance of blockchain-based assets and a precursor to large-scale capital inflows. According to Rietveld, sovereign wealth funds across Europe, as well as major U.S. investment institutions, are preparing to expand their digital asset holdings, marking a major turning point for global markets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A Shift Away from Fiat Dependence Rietveld was critical of the traditional monetary system, particularly the practices of central banks that rely on creating debt and devaluing currency. He argued that this system is fundamentally unsustainable and continues to erode public trust. In contrast, he said that cryptocurrencies such as XRP represent a more transparent and efficient alternative capable of restoring balance to the global financial system. He added that as inflation and debt concerns grow worldwide, people are beginning to recognize the advantages of decentralized digital currencies. In his view, the gradual loss of confidence in fiat money is accelerating the adoption of blockchain-based solutions. He emphasized that XRP and other digital assets offer a path toward financial independence by providing an escape from the flaws of centralized monetary control.

Wildberger said the goal is digital sovereignty, not isolation, explaining that Germany and the European Union must act as players in the technology sector rather than customers. ‚ÄúWe need to actively participate in this sector as players, not as customers,‚Äù he said. This comes as many Europeans grow uneasy about U.S. President Donald Trump‚Äôs trade policies , which focus heavily on promoting American interests and have pushed some European governments and businesses to look for alternatives to U.S. technology providers that dominate everything from cloud services to AI infrastructure. Wildberger said Europe must not stay dependent when ‚Äúthere is a huge growth market for technology, innovation, software, data and artificial intelligence.‚Äù Germany demands real control over data and infrastructure Wildberger said that Germany and Europe have already built impressive players in the field, naming Mistral AI, DeepL, and Aleph Alpha as proof that the continent can compete globally. But the German lawmaker admitted that the U.S. still leads in several core areas, especially in artificial intelligence, and that cooperation will remain necessary. ‚ÄúDigital sovereignty doesn‚Äôt mean protectionism,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe want to and must be accessible for the global market.‚Äù Asked about fears that Trump might disrupt transatlantic partnerships, Wildberger downplayed them. ‚ÄúU.S. companies of course also continue to be interested in doing business abroad,‚Äù he said, but added that German firms must be able to choose who they work with, where they store their data, and who runs their digital infrastructure. For Wildberger, digital sovereignty reportedly means rethinking the entire supply chain from rare earth materials and chip design to servers and undersea cables that make the modern internet possible. Europe keeps leaning on US hyperscalers despite new policies Meanwhile, at the Forrester Technology & Innovation Summit EMEA in London, Forrester predicted that Europe will intensify its push to reduce dependence on global providers and take more control over its technology stack. But despite all that effort, no European company will fully detach from U.S. hyperscalers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud by 2026. Analysts linked this continued dependence to geopolitical tensions, economic instability, and strict new laws such as the European Green Deal and the EU AI Act, both of which restrict experimental, high-risk technology use. These conditions, they said, will force European businesses to keep working with American cloud providers that already dominate the market. The same report said that consumer use of generative AI across Europe will double by 2026, but enterprise adoption will still lag far behind the United States due to tighter regulations and less-developed AI ecosystems. The United Kingdom, however, is expected to move faster because of lighter rules and fewer language barriers. The study also predicted that EU defense spending would bring a 20% increase in technology budgets for public infrastructure. This comes after NATO members agreed in June 2025 to lift defense spending to 5% of GDP, with 1.5% of that set aside for ‚Äúenabling infrastructure.‚Äù Finally, it warned that Britain‚Äôs AI policies could backfire. The UK government‚Äôs enthusiasm for U.S. technology firms like Anthropic and OpenAI, its refusal to sign global AI governance agreements, and its lack of binding regulation could erode public trust even as productivity rises.

The sale is reportedly already in the advanced stage. The decision to offload its chemicals division follows the surge in demand for AI infrastructure, as companies across the technology sector realign their strategies to benefit from the innovation boom. MKS moves for semiconductor growth MKS Instruments, a Massachusetts-based supplier to major semiconductor manufacturers including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company ( TSMC ), is preparing to sell a $1B specialty chemicals division, which it acquired as part of its $5.1B takeover of Atotech in 2021. The division up for sale brings in roughly $100M in adjusted annual earnings and its major function is to supply the technology used to apply coatings and finishes to cars and industrial equipment. MKS intends to keep the parts of the business that produce equipment for semiconductor and circuit board manufacturing. The sale process is reportedly at an advanced stage, but there is no guarantee a deal will be finalized. The company‚Äôs shares closed at $121.30 on Friday, representing an increase of 14.4% year-to-date, giving it a market capitalization of $8.3B. Markets are closed over the weekend, but MKS stock closed Friday at around $121.26. Source: Google Finance AI demand fuels investor confidence In recent months, MKS has attempted to persuade investors that its tools and systems are important to fulfilling the surge in semiconductor demand. The company supplies some of the world‚Äôs largest chipmakers, including TSMC, Applied Materials, and Lam Research. During its August earnings call, Chief Executive John Lee said that the company‚Äôs double-digit growth in its electronics and packaging departments shows the growing complexity of modern electronics applications and validates the firm‚Äôs role in supporting innovation. ‚ÄúComplex electronics applications like AI are driving growth,‚Äù Lee said. MKS‚Äôs semiconductor and electronics divisions delivered revenue growth that exceeded analyst expectations in the most recent quarter. The global AI boom , led by rising demand for data center infrastructure and advanced chips from companies like Nvidia, TSMC, and Intel, has triggered a wave of investment in the semiconductor supply chain. MKS has benefited directly from this momentum due to chipmakers expanding production capacity and seeking more advanced tools to meet processing demands. The sale of MKS‚Äôs chemicals division has reportedly attracted interest from a range of strategic buyers and private equity firms. Earlier this month, Carlyle Group struck a ‚Ç¨7.7B deal to acquire a majority stake in BASF‚Äôs coatings unit, with BASF retaining a minority share. Notably, Carlyle previously owned 79% of Atotech before MKS acquired it in 2021.

Optimism price prediction for 2028 suggests the token could reach a maximum value of $11.14. In 2031, OP tokens will range between $27.9 and $33.66, with an average value of $28.88. Optimism‚Äôs (OP) commitment to innovation is highlighted by its support for Layer-3 solutions. These solutions enable the development of decentralized applications (dApps) on top of Layer-2 chains, contributing to the expansive Optimism Superchain. The platform‚Äôs initiatives, including introducing custom gas tokens and Plasma mode aimed at reducing onboarding and operational costs, make it more accessible for new users and developers. As the market closely watches the price movements and growth trajectory of the token, can Optimism reach $10 soon? Let‚Äôs get into the OP price prediction for 2025 ‚Äì 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Optimism Token OP Price $0.4512 Market Cap $787.13B Trading Volume $571.76M Circulating Supply 1.778B OP All-time High $4.85 (Mar 06, 2024) All-time Low $0.4005 (Jun 18, 2022) 24-hour High $0.607 24-hour Low $0.3408 Optimism price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 7.10% 50-Day SMA $0.7274 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 27 (Fear) Green Days 14/30 (47%) 200-Day SMA $0.7524 Optimism price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: OP is severely oversold after dropping below $0.50, but bearish momentum is still strong. The 4-hour chart shows minor stabilization, though volume and MACD remain weak. Optimism 1-day price chart The OP/USDT daily candle for October 11 shows continued downside follow-through after the major breakdown below $0.55. Price now sits below the lower Bollinger band at $0.5293, suggesting the market is deeply oversold and under strong bearish control. OPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD remains firmly bearish, with both lines diverging lower and no sign of a crossover. The histogram bars have expanded downward, showing that momentum continues to favor sellers. Volume has surged to 83.4M, indicating panic-driven liquidation rather than bottom accumulation. Unless the price closes back above $0.50 soon, OP risks sliding further toward the next supports around $0.42 and $0.39. Bulls need a daily close above $0.50‚Äì$0.53 to regain short-term stability. Optimism 4-hour price chart On the 4-hour timeframe, OP is attempting to base around $0.45 after a sharp decline, but the structure remains fragile. The Alligator lines are strongly fanned out to the downside, confirming a solid bearish trend. However, they‚Äôre beginning to slightly flatten, hinting that selling pressure may be easing slightly in the short term. OPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The RSI has lifted from extreme lows near 15 to around 30, which suggests the token is oversold but trying to stabilize. Still, this is not yet a confirmed reversal, merely a pause in downside momentum. The OBV continues to trend lower at 67.7M, indicating no fresh accumulation. Immediate resistance sits around $0.50‚Äì$0.52 (the green Alligator line), which aligns with the lower boundary of the prior consolidation zone. A bounce toward this area would likely face rejection unless volume picks up significantly. On the downside, $0.43 remains the nearest support, followed by $0.40.

OP remains under heavy bearish pressure, with no clear reversal signals yet. The current setup suggests a short-term consolidation or small relief bounce could form between $0.43‚Äì$0.50, but the overall direction remains downward until a daily close above $0.53 confirms strength. For now, any rebound should be seen as corrective rather than the start of a new uptrend. Is Optimism a good crypto investment? Optimism (OP) could be a good investment if you believe in Ethereum scaling and the growth of Layer 2 solutions. However, like all crypto, it‚Äôs risky, and its value depends on adoption and market trends. Only invest what you‚Äôre willing to lose! Will OP recover? A recovery is possible, but we fear the overall bearish sentiment makes a short-term rebound unlikely. However, as the market consolidates, we expect reduced volatility, which may lead to a breakout in either direction, depending on market dynamics. Will Optimism reach $10? Yes, Optimism is projected to close up to $10 by 2028. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in its price. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and require unprecedented growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook.

Optimism historic price sentiment Optimism price history by Coingecko OP launched with an initial value of $4.57 on May 31 but dropped sharply in June due to the UST stablecoin de-pegging and LUNA collapse, closing June at $0.5434. It further declined to $0.4147 by mid-July. In August, OP briefly surged above $1.90, but by mid-October, it dropped to $0.70 following the FTX collapse. In Q1 2023, OP surged past $3.00 during a crypto bull run but lost 66% shortly after. A recovery saw it close the year at $3.90. OP saw an eventful 2024, reaching an all-time high of $4.85 in March before sliding below $2.30 by mid-April. After a brief recovery to over $2.90 in May, it entered a bearish phase, trading at $1.82‚Äì$1.96 by July and $1.54‚Äì$1.62 by October. November brought a spark of hope with a peak at $2.60. OP closed December within the range of $1.611‚Äì$2.773. In January 2025, OP peaked at $2.18 but lost momentum, dropping to as low as $0.84 in February.

What looked like a hold above $0.25 turned into a fast breakdown that dragged the Dogecoin price to as low as $0.148 within 24 hours. However, technical analysis from crypto analyst Kaleo shows Dogecoin is ready to hit new all-time highs. In a post on X, he doubled down on a remarkably bullish prediction, stating that $6.90 is a ‚Äúmagnet‚Äù for Dogecoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Who? XRP Leads Coinbase Search Charts, Beating The Giants Dogecoin Chart Tells The Story In his post on the social media platform X, Kaleo noted how members of the crypto community are increasingly waking up to see how primed Dogecoin is to reach higher levels. The chart accompanying Kaleo‚Äôs post shows the historical pattern that Dogecoin has followed after previous Bitcoin halvings. Each halving has always been followed by years of massive upside moves in Dogecoin‚Äôs price, with the meme coin breaking out of long-term descending resistance lines to record exponential gains. Examples shown in this chart are the 2017 and 2021 explosive price surges. Kaleo suggested that the current market phase mirrors the same structure seen just before the 2021 bull run, when Dogecoin broke above a key lower-high resistance from its previous all-time high. This moment is illustrated on the chart with the label ‚ÄúWe are here.‚Äù Dogecoin Price Chart. Source: @CryptoKaleo on X The $6.90 Magnet: Kaleo‚Äôs Logic Behind The Forecast Kaleo acknowledged that the projection of a $6.9 Dogecoin price target might sound a little too bullish, but his logic is based on the logic of market cap math. In his post, he explained that his projection for Bitcoin this cycle is to surpass $500,000. If Bitcoin surpasses $500,000 as expected, it would translate to a $10 trillion market capitalization. This sheer amount of inflow would flow into the rest of the crypto market, and Dogecoin could theoretically reach 10% of Bitcoin‚Äôs valuation, just as it did during the 2021 mania. That ratio implies a $1 trillion market cap for Dogecoin, which is equivalent to a $6.94 price per token based on the current circulating supply. Dogecoin‚Äôs recent price crash has complicated this bullish narrative. Instead of confirming an imminent breakout, the meme coin has fallen below the $0.25 support level. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.1971, down by 21.4% in the past 24 hours and having reached an intraday low of $0.1489.

Yet, it also risks extending Dogecoin‚Äôs bearish structure and delaying any breakout if the price fails to recover quickly. Right now, recovery above $0.25 is important for bulls to rebuild bullish momentum.

Prominent market commentator Chad Steingraber described the incident as an ‚ÄúXRP Black Swan,‚Äù pointing to the scale of losses that accompanied the broader market crash on October 10. The global financial landscape suffered a sudden shock following an unexpected policy announcement by U.S. President Donald Trump, who declared that his administration would introduce an additional 100% tariff on goods imported from China. The move reignited fears of a renewed trade conflict between the world‚Äôs two largest economies, sparking heavy sell-offs across equities, commodities, and digital assets. As panic spread, the total value of the cryptocurrency market dropped below $4 trillion, landing around $3.7 trillion. Billions of dollars in leveraged positions were liquidated within hours, leaving the market in one of its most volatile trading sessions to date. History made with an XRP Black Swan The biggest XRP LONG liquidation ever at nearly HALF A BILLION ‚Äì> $422.103Million https://t.co/hFZhOFQj1g pic.twitter.com/AQb3YKO4xS ‚Äî Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) October 10, 2025 XRP Drops $1.27 in a Single Day Before the sell-off began, XRP had been trading in a relatively stable range around $2.80, showing moderate strength despite broader market uncertainty. However, the sudden wave of panic selling erased those gains. By the afternoon of October 10 (UTC), the token had fallen sharply, reaching an intraday low of $1.53, a loss of approximately $1.27 within hours. Despite the steep fall, XRP later regained some ground as buyers stepped in to stabilize prices. The asset closed the day at $2.35, reflecting a significant recovery from its daily low but still ending the session in negative territory. Data from CoinGlass confirmed that the turbulence triggered one of the largest liquidation events ever recorded in the crypto sector. Within a 12-hour window, more than $19 billion worth of leveraged positions were wiped out across major exchanges. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Of this amount, long traders absorbed most of the impact, losing around $16.7 billion, while short traders accounted for roughly $2.4 billion in liquidations. Updated figures later in the day showed the total amount of liquidations rising slightly to $19.31 billion, as both long and short traders continued to face margin calls amid the persistent volatility. ‚ÄòXRP Black Swan‚Äô Becomes a Defining Moment According to Steingraber , XRP‚Äôs price collapse represented the largest single-session liquidation event in the token‚Äôs history. He referred to it as an ‚ÄúXRP Black Swan,‚Äù emphasizing the scale and suddenness of the market reaction. CoinGlass data supported this assessment, showing that XRP traders collectively lost $707 million over the past 24 hours. Long positions bore the majority of the losses, totaling $615.46 million, while short positions accounted for approximately $91.96 million. Analysts have noted that this is the most severe liquidation event XRP has experienced since its inception. Currently, XRP is trading around $2.47, marking a 12.13% decline over the previous 24 hours and extending its weekly drop to 17.43%. The event underscores the growing fragility of leveraged trading in the digital asset market and highlights how swiftly sentiment can reverse in reaction to geopolitical developments.

Perpetual futures ‚Äî ‚Äúperps‚Äù in trading shorthand ‚Äî are cash-settled contracts with no expiry that mirror spot via funding payments, not delivery. Profits and losses net against a shared margin pool, which is why, in stress, venues may need to reallocate exposure quickly to keep books balanced. Man, who is the lead portfolio manager of the Bitwise Multi-Strategy Alpha Fund, said bitcoin fell 13% from peak to trough in a single hour, while losses in long-tail tokens were far steeper ‚Äî he added that ATOM ‚Äúfell to virtually zero‚Äù on some venues before rebounding. He estimated roughly $65 billion in open interest was erased, resetting positioning to levels last seen in July. The headline numbers, he argued, mattered less than the plumbing: when uncertainty spikes, liquidity providers widen quotes or step back to manage inventory and capital, organic liquidations stop clearing at bankruptcy prices, and venues turn to emergency tools. According to Man, exchanges in that situation leaned on safety valves. He said auto-deleveraging kicked in at some venues, forcibly closing part of profitable counter-positions when there was not enough cash on the losing side to pay winners. He also pointed to liquidity vaults that absorb distressed flow ‚Äî Hyperliquid‚Äôs HLP ‚Äúhad an extremely profitable day,‚Äù he said, buying at deep discounts and selling into spikes. What failed and what held Man said centralized venues saw the most dramatic dislocations as order books thinned, which is why long-tail tokens broke harder than bitcoin and ether. By contrast, he said DeFi liquidations were muted for two reasons: major lending protocols tend to accept blue-chip collateral such as BTC and ETH, and Aave and Morpho ‚Äúhardcoded USDe‚Äôs price to $1,‚Äù limiting cascade risk. Although USDe remained solvent, he said it traded around $0.65 on centralized exchanges amid illiquidity ‚Äî leaving users who posted it as margin on those venues vulnerable to liquidation. Beyond directional traders, Man highlighted hidden exposures for market-neutral funds. He said the real risks on days like Friday are operational ‚Äî algorithms running, exchanges staying up, accurate marks, the ability to move margin and execute hedges on time. He checked in with several managers who reported they were fine, but said he would not be surprised if ‚Äúsome c-tier trading teams got carried out.‚Äù Man also described unusually wide dispersion across venues, citing $300-plus spreads at times between Binance and Hyperliquid on ETH-USD. Prices recovered from extreme lows, he said, and positioning flushes created opportunities for traders with dry powder. Man also mentioned that with open interest down sharply, markets entered the weekend on firmer footing than the day before.",Markets|Crypto|Markets|perpetual contracts|Liquidations|News,EN,0,0,MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|TRADING|ATOM,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-10-11 23:57:30

Prices have been volatile all through 2025 as the old and new projects battle it out. MAGACOIN FINANCE has ascended to unprecedented heights amid the chaos. Investors are looking to get in early as the project‚Äôs community is growing rapidly while the project itself is growing exponentially. Many people see this as an ideal opportunity to enter the market before the next significant upward move and before the project reaches its expected 20,000% ROI. As the market shifts, Ethereum is struggling to hold key levels, whilst Tron remains surprisingly resilient. Ethereum Loses Key Support Ethereum , the world‚Äôs second-largest cryptocurrency, dropped below important price levels this week. Once the price of ETH didn‚Äôt hold above $3900, it started slipping further to the $3800 range. Analysts think the drop happened because the market was liquidated due to BTC‚Äôs correction and issues with the ETF. The drop was also met with declining on-chain activities as gas fees declined significantly due to less congestion. Although Ethereum has some weakness in the short term, the long-term sentiment is bullish. Once macroeconomic stability returns and fresh staking inflows are deep, several traders expect a strong rebound. According to some experts, ETH could rise to $4,500 to $5,000 later this year if ETF approvals arrive and Layer-2 adoption speeds up. Currently, the asset faces resistance zones that may limit its upside until institutional demand reinvigorates. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Hidden Gem of 2025 While the spotlight remains on the larger market players, MAGACOIN FINANCE has quietly become one of the most talked-about projects in the altcoin community. The token has achieved massive growth in a short period, quickly positioning itself as a major contender for the next breakout. MAGACOIN FINANCE has built a foundation of trust and credibility rarely seen among early-stage cryptocurrencies. Its focus on innovation, security, and long-term development continues to attract a wave of new investors eager to get in before listings on major exchanges. Experts predict that once listings go live and trading opens globally, MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver up to 20,000% ROI, placing it among the top-performing assets in the market. The project‚Äôs roadmap emphasizes continuous ecosystem growth, partnerships, and expanding token utility ‚Äì all key factors for sustained momentum. With every new milestone, community interest grows stronger, and analysts now describe MAGACOIN FINANCE as the most promising early-stage crypto project of 2025 , capable of outperforming established names once the market turns bullish again. Tron Defies the Market Trend Tron (TRX) performed well, outpacing other major cryptocurrencies that dropped by double-digit percentages. The stablecoin transactions of the network and the constant growth of its DeFi have helped it remain one of the few cryptoassets with stable prices. TRX has been holding quite well at the $0.31 level. The Tron DAO Reserve is getting stronger while cross-chain activities are getting bigger. This is what powers the momentum. In recent weeks, the transaction volume and total value locked (TVL) of the blockchain are setting new records owing to to the increased user activity. As per analysts, a suitable focus on stability, liquidity and utility-based products could make Tron a safe haven like Bitcoin during crypto market volatility. It has further strengthened its market position through ongoing integrations with a diverse array of payment solutions and blockchain applications. Market Volatility and Investor Strategy Due to current uncertain times, investors have become more selective yet opportunistic. Many traders are using the market correction as an opportunity to reposition their portfolios before the subsequent recovery. The primary large-cap assets in the portfolio, Bitcoin and Ethereum, have proven to be invaluable. However, the focus is on newer emerging altcoins which have the potential of high upside. As we‚Äôve seen in the past, buying into strong projects while price action is down tends to yield incredible gains when the action picks up again. Initiatives like MAGACOIN FINANCE are now recognised as a strategic move for those seeking to achieve exponential growth in the future cycle. The fact that its audited foundation, organic community growth and future listing on exchanges make it this year‚Äôs emerging token. Conclusion As Ethereum struggles to recover and Tron continues to disregard the market trend, the attention is slowly shifting to the new-generation projects with huge growth potential. The volatility that marked 2025 has shown that innovation still manages to stand out and MAGACOIN FINANCE is proving this with its prominence. MAGACOIN FINANCE is expected to give its investors a 20,000% ROI. This is due to its amazing growth, audited verification and robust roadmap prior to global launch. To many, it will be seen as something more than just another altcoin. It‚Äôs a rare opportunity in being involved in one of the next success stories of the cryptocurrency space.

Riley has stated that XRP could soon achieve its most bullish weekly candle on record if the token maintains its current momentum through the end of the week. In an update shared on X, Riley explained that a weekly close at $3.115 would set a new record for XRP, marking the strongest weekly candle since its inception. The projection comes as the broader crypto market attempts to stabilize following a period of sharp volatility and widespread liquidations. Market Turbulence Follows Tariff Announcement The analyst‚Äôs remarks came after a turbulent trading session that saw several major cryptocurrencies plunge in value before making rapid recoveries. The sharp downturn was triggered by U.S. President Donald Trump‚Äôs announcement of a 100% tariff on Chinese imports, a move that reignited fears of a trade conflict between the two largest global economies. If we close over $3.1150 by Sunday, it'll be the most bullish $XRP weekly candle in history. ‚Äî Patrick L Riley (@Acquired_Savant) October 10, 2025 The announcement led to significant sell-offs across traditional and digital financial markets. Within hours, the total global cryptocurrency market capitalization dropped to about $3.7 trillion, while the U.S. stock market reportedly lost $1.65 trillion in value. Data from CoinGlass showed that $19 billion in leveraged positions were liquidated during the crash, marking one of the largest single-day liquidation events in crypto history. XRP Suffers 56% Intraday Drop Before Recovery Amid the turmoil, XRP recorded one of its steepest intraday declines in recent months. On October 10, the token fell from a daily high of $2.84 to a low of $1.25 on Binance, representing a 56% drop within 24 hours. However, the asset quickly regained a large portion of its losses, rebounding to around $2.47 by press time . Despite the sharp volatility, XRP‚Äôs ability to recover nearly 100% from its daily low has been interpreted by some market observers as a sign of underlying strength. Assessing the Possibility of a Historic Weekly Close According to Riley‚Äôs analysis, if XRP closes this week at $3.115, it would mark the most bullish weekly candle in its trading history. The potential milestone is based on the strong recovery from this week‚Äôs low, which represents a 148% rebound from $1.25 to $3.11. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 For comparison, XRP‚Äôs largest weekly gain occurred in December 2017, when the token surged 215%, rising from $0.23 to $0.71. While the current setup may not exceed that performance in terms of total percentage growth, the analyst emphasized that the recovery from extreme lows makes this week particularly significant. XRP began the current week trading at $2.97, meaning a close at $3.11 would represent a more modest 4.86% weekly increase. Nonetheless, the rapid rebound from its intraweek low has strengthened optimism among traders that XRP could be preparing for a more sustained uptrend. XRP Sets New Quarterly Record Beyond its weekly performance, XRP also achieved a historic quarterly close at the end of Q3 2025, finishing the period at $2.846, a 27.16% increase from its Q2 close of $2.23. This figure marks the highest quarterly close ever recorded for XRP. In addition, September 2025 now ranks as the third-highest monthly close in the asset‚Äôs history, behind January 2025 ($3.03) and July 2025 ($3.02). With Q4 2025 now underway , analysts remain optimistic about XRP‚Äôs performance prospects. Historically, the token has recorded its strongest gains during the fourth quarter, with average growth of around 140%. Past examples include a 240% surge in Q4 2024 and a 1,064% increase in Q4 2017, both of which contributed to major bullish cycles in XRP‚Äôs history. While the broader crypto market remains volatile, XRP‚Äôs resilience amid recent turmoil has strengthened investor optimism . Patrick L. Riley‚Äôs analysis underscores the potential for a historic weekly candle if the asset maintains its momentum through the weekend.

53013123,604045,1760229046,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53013123.jpeg,CZ‚Äôs Comeback? Trump Weighs Presidential Pardon For Binance Founder,https://bitcoinist.com/president-trump-potential-pardon-binance-founder-cz/,"US President Donald Trump is reportedly considering a pardon for Binance co-founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao , commonly known as CZ. This development comes amid heavy liquidations in the crypto market after the Republican president also announced plans for a 100% tariff on Chinese goods. Could CZ Be Heading Back To Binance? In a report on October 10, Fox Business reporter Charles Gasparino shared an inside scoop stating that discussions in the White House had commenced over a potential presidential pardon for Binance‚Äôs former boss, CZ. The analyst explains that this motion appeared to have sprung out of a partial belief in Trump‚Äôs camp that the fraud case against the Chinese-born Canadian was ‚Äúweak‚Äù and that his felony conviction and prison sentence were disproportionate.In 2023, US authorities charged Changpeng Zhao and Binance with violating the Bank Secrecy Act and failing to maintain adequate anti‚Äìmoney laundering (AML) controls. According to the US Department of Justice, Binance allowed illicit funds to move through its platform, including transactions linked to sanctioned countries and criminal enterprises such as the Lazarus group of North Korea. CZ personally pleaded guilty to one count of failing to maintain an effective AML program, admitting that he did not implement sufficient safeguards to prevent Binance from being used for unlawful purposes. The plea deal was part of a broader settlement in which Binance agreed to pay over $4.3 billion in penalties, one of the largest corporate fines in US history. As part of the agreement, CZ also stepped down as Binance CEO and was sentenced to four months in federal prison in April 2024. Following his conviction, Zhao temporarily relinquished direct control of Binance but continues to retain his ownership stake. A potential presidential pardon could effectively erase CZ‚Äôs conviction and restore his legal standing. However, likely, the former Binance boss remains away from the formal leadership of the exchange due to Binance‚Äôs agreement with the DOJ under the oversight of a multi-year independent compliance monitor. Presidential Pardon Still Some Time Away Amid the positive news for Zhao, Gasparino has also noted that the presidential pardon may take some time as the US government is facing critical issues, including managing the conflict in the Gaza Strip and Ukraine, while also teasing another tariff battle with China. Notably, Trump has now threatened to impose a 100% tariff on all Chinese goods after the Asian nation announced plans to implement sweeping export controls on almost every product starting from November 1, 2025. In response, the general crypto market is down by 9.63% and is presently valued at around $3.72 trillion. Within this time, Bitcoin, the market leader, has declined by 7.81 with prices now set around $111,900.",Binance|binance|Changpeng Zhao|CZ|Gasparino|President Donald Trump|Presidential Pardon,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|BNB|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-12 00:30:46

As the third-quarter earnings season begins, traders expect Corporate America to prove that the rally is justified. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, analysts are projecting 7.4% profit growth for U.S. companies this quarter, up slightly since mid-August, while the MSCI All-Country World Index is also heading toward an all-time high. The surge, driven by the AI investment boom, has inflated valuations and expectations alike. But that optimism is running into headwinds. The S&P 500 has soared 32% from its April low, yet tensions over tariffs, worries about a tech bubble, and a still-fractured global trade system are weighing on confidence. Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, said: ‚ÄúInvestors will be very unforgiving of any kind of slip, whether it‚Äôs a slip in earnings or a slip of the tongue when talking about expectations.‚Äù The pressure now shifts to the nation‚Äôs biggest players as JPMorgan Chase & Co. and other top banks kick off results next week, followed later by the megacap tech giants whose gains have powered most of this rally. Trump‚Äôs tariffs hammer stock profits ‚Äì Investors demand clarity from companies Trade is once again the story of the season. President Donald Trump announced plans for a new 100% tariff on Chinese goods, plus export controls on ‚Äúany and all critical software,‚Äù to begin November 1. The decision hit markets immediately, with analysts warning that months of elevated tariffs are already cutting into corporate profits. Deutsche Bank AG estimates that S&P 500 earnings growth would have been about one percentage point higher this quarter without those tariffs. Asian exporters, who shipped $1.3 trillion in goods to the U.S. last year, have so far weathered the hikes, though many fund managers think that‚Äôs due to front-loaded exports before tariffs fully take effect. In Europe, earnings expectations are already being trimmed. A Citigroup index shows estimates have been falling steadily since mid-March, lowering the bar for upcoming reports. At the same time, the AI spending boom hasn‚Äôt slowed. UBS forecasts a 67% jump in global capital expenditures this year to $375 billion, with Societe Generale noting that the capex-to-sales ratio is at a 25-year high. But any hint of a slowdown could shake investor confidence. Mike O‚ÄôRourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading, said , ‚ÄúA slowdown would be like slamming on the brakes. A lot of names would enter a real profit-taking mode.‚Äù Layoffs, currency swings, and China‚Äôs weak growth add pressure With the federal government shutdown blocking new employment data, investors are watching earnings calls for signs of workforce cuts. Ross Mayfield, strategist at Robert W. Baird & Co., warned that layoffs could expose deeper weakness in the labor market and weigh on consumer spending. ‚ÄúIf you see enough of those start to stack up,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúit‚Äôs a signal the labor market is weaker than expected.‚Äù Currency trends are also shaping Q3 results. The U.S. dollar rallied against major currencies but remains well below its 2022 peak. That‚Äôs a relief for exporters and multinationals converting foreign income into dollars. Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, said the softer dollar, along with AI-driven capital investment, could add ‚Äúanother 5‚Äì7% upside‚Äù to profit forecasts and lift earnings at a low-teens pace this quarter. In Europe, the stronger euro remains a drag. Susana Cruz, strategist at Panmure Liberum, said the recent dip came too late to benefit Q3 reports, especially for construction, healthcare, and technology firms that generate nearly 60% of sales abroad. Meanwhile, China‚Äôs CSI 300 index is up 17% this year, but its Q3 profit outlook is flat, with just 3% growth expected. The upcoming meeting between Trump and Xi Jinping is now uncertain, as both countries tighten restrictions on tech and material flows. Still, there‚Äôs a glimmer of improvement. Goldman Sachs believes China‚Äôs corporate downgrades are slowing as factory activity and industrial profits rebound. Some analysts also pointed to Beijing‚Äôs efforts to tackle involution, the destructive domestic price wars that have plagued competition. Want your project in front of crypto‚Äôs top minds?

The Oracle of Omaha‚Äôs long game with Japan‚Äôs five powerful trading companies (Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Itochu, Marubeni, Sumitomo) has turned into one of his largest foreign equity plays, as the total value of those stock holdings has rallied by 392% since he first went public with them in Q3 of 2020 on Warren‚Äôs 90th birthday. Back then, Berkshire‚Äôs positions were worth around $6.3 billion. Today, they sit at roughly $31 billion, thanks to both continued buying and stock gains ranging between 227% and 551%. Berkshire had been quietly building these stakes for a year before Warren made them public. At first, he said Berkshire held about 5% in each of the five companies. But recent filings show that two of those holdings have now gone above 10%, suggesting he has continued to buy despite earlier promises to stay below that level. Some of the additional purchases may not even have been disclosed yet, meaning Berkshire‚Äôs real exposure to Japan could be higher than what‚Äôs known. Berkshire boosts its stakes in Mitsui and Mitsubishi This week, Mitsui & Co. confirmed in a statement that Berkshire‚Äôs insurance arm, National Indemnity, owned 292,044,900 shares as of September 30, equal to about 10.1% of the company. At Friday‚Äôs close, those shares were worth nearly $7.1 billion, making Berkshire Mitsui‚Äôs largest shareholder. The number is up from 285,401,400 shares, or a 9.7% stake, reported back in March. Mitsui said Berkshire had earlier informed it that voting rights had exceeded 10%, but this filing was the first to reveal the exact amount. Two weeks earlier, Mitsubishi also confirmed that Berkshire‚Äôs holding had climbed to 10.2%, up from 9.7% in March. The three other companies (Itochu, Marubeni, and Sumitomo) haven‚Äôt issued updates since spring, but market analysts expect those stakes could also have quietly increased. Warren had initially agreed not to raise Berkshire‚Äôs ownership above 10% without approval from each firm. But in his February 2024 annual letter to shareholders, he wrote, ‚ÄúAs we approached this limit, the five companies agreed to moderately relax the ceiling.‚Äù He added, ‚ÄúOver time, you will likely see Berkshire‚Äôs ownership of all five increase somewhat .‚Äù That opened the door for him to expand beyond the original cap. Occidental struggles while Berkshire‚Äôs Japan bet soars Warren said in 2023 that he bought into these Japanese firms in 2020 because ‚Äúthey were selling at what I thought was a ridiculous price, particularly the price compared to the interest rates prevailing at that time.‚Äù He later told shareholders Berkshire plans to keep them for ‚Äú50 years or forever .‚Äù But while Berkshire‚Äôs Japan holdings have performed, its Occidental Petroleum investment hasn‚Äôt.Warren began buying Occidental shares in 2022, building a 26% stake now worth around $12 billion. The company‚Äôs CEO, Vicki Hollub, 65, has led the firm since April 2016, but the stock has fallen from $76 to $45, producing a negative 20% total return, including dividends. Over the same period, the Energy Select Sector SPDR, led by Exxon Mobil and Chevron, has gained over 90%, while competitors like Diamondback Energy and EOG Resources have doubled. At Berkshire‚Äôs 2023 annual meeting, Warren called Hollub an ‚Äúextraordinary manager.‚Äù Still, Barron‚Äôs estimates Berkshire‚Äôs average cost per Occidental share in the low $50s , leaving him in the red. He‚Äôs long preached about keeping strong balance sheets at both Berkshire and its investments (like Apple, Coca-Cola, and American Express) but with Occidental, he broke that rule. And now, he‚Äôs paying the price. So are Occidental‚Äôs other shareholders. Want your project in front of crypto‚Äôs top minds?

XRP and Cardano (ADA) both fell significantly over the past day, which rekindled the capital rotation talk among traders. With the price decrease, investors seek stable opportunities, so MAGACOIN FINANCE can be considered one of the best altcoins to buy this week. Moreover, the rising rotation movement has been characterized by decreased reliance on the old tokens such as XRP, ADA and DOGE to new presales with better returns. According to analysts, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the best altcoin to buy now as investor demand continues to surge. XRP Price Slides Double Digits, What‚Äôs Next? Over the past 24 hours, XRP has experienced a steep drop of 11%, falling from $2.82 to $2.50. The selloff wiped off billions of its market cap, which is currently standing at around $149.8 billion. Although the market declined, the volume of trade increased by over 315% which is an indication of high activity from panic sellers and opportunistic buyers. XRPUSD 1-Day Chart | Source: CMC The chart depicts that XRP is recovering marginally on intraday lows around $2.00 and stabilizing at around $2.50. Nonetheless, the recovery has been weak with sellers still limiting any rise above $2.60. The structure is a sign of a market that is struggling to recover, consisting of lower highs with every attempt to rally. According to the technical indicators, XRP is consolidating between $2.40 and $2.60, a range that is likely to determine the direction in the short term. The persistence of price action above $2.40 may result in an accumulation stage, which would allow potential recovery to $2.80. However, when the token falls below $2.30, a retest of the $2.00 support can occur. Even though it has weakened in the short term, the fundamentals of XRP, especially in the cross-border payment solutions, are still strong in supporting the long-term narrative. Cardano Whales Rotate to This Top Altcoin Cardano (ADA) also endured heavy losses, falling 17% to trade around $0.68. The decline followed a major breakdown below the $0.80 support, leading to cascading liquidations and a 417% surge in trading volume to $5.57 billion. This intense market activity indicates that whales and leveraged traders are actively repositioning portfolios. ADAUSD 1-Day Chart | Source: CMC The token briefly rebounded from lows near $0.50, showing that buyers are defending key liquidity zones. Still, ADA faces strong resistance between $0.70 and $0.72, levels that were once solid supports. Its current volatility mirrors the broader crypto market‚Äôs risk-off sentiment following Bitcoin‚Äôs correction. However, on-chain data shows long-term investors maintaining positions as they seek new entry points. Many are rotating capital into high-potential presales , with MAGACOIN FINANCE emerging as a favored target. Its growing presale traction and strong analyst endorsements have attracted attention from former ADA holders looking for the next growth story. With $15 million already raised, MAGACOIN FINANCE is now viewed as the best altcoin to buy during this market dip. Dogecoin Price Prediction Dogecoin (DOGE) suffered one of the largest declines among top-10 assets, falling over 21% to trade near $0.195. The drop came after a short-lived consolidation around $0.25, triggering widespread liquidations and stop-loss cascades. Market capitalization dropped to $29.55 billion as traders rushed to exit positions. DOGEUSD 1-Day Chart | Source: CMC The chart indicates a flash crash that momentarily drove the prices below $0.15 and then a slight recovery. This volatility suggests both fear-led exits and speculative buyers entering the opportunity. The volume of trading in DOGE increased by 292 percent, which supports the story of panic selling alongside tactical buying. Analysts find the $0.19 mark as vital short-term support, and the resistance is around $0.22 and 0.25. Unless DOGE can regain these areas, then there is the risk that it will move towards $0.16 again. To long-term investors this consolidation can be a possible entry point in case of improvement of the broader sentiment. Nevertheless, capital is moving away from meme tokens such as DOGE and towards newer presale tokens with actual growth traction, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is first in the pack. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is the Best Altcoin to Bet On MAGACOIN FINANCE presale has been a topic that has attracted a lot of attention in the crypto market and has already raised over $15 million . Analysts have multiple reasons why it is popular: Ethereum-based reliability, transparent presale stages and a rapidly expanding investor base. These are the early signs of other successful breakout projects such as Shiba Inu and PEPE before their viral booms. The excitement among investors is still growing with every step of the pre-sale increasing the price of the token, which motivates early participation. Analysts forecast that by the end of 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE will give 100x returns and bearish projections target $1.00 per token after exchange listings. With XRP, ADA, and DOGE under market volatility, capital rotation is proceeding to presales with more fundamental and defined upside potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE is the best altcoin to buy now due to the growing investor demand. Conclusion The sharp correction of the crypto market has provided fresh opportunities to investors looking for early-stage growth. As XRP, Cardano and Dogecoin are struggling to recover from the loss, the presale momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE is taking another turn. Having already raised more than $15 million and being ranked as one of the best altcoins to buy in 2025 by analysts, it has become the obvious target of those investors who focus beyond short-term volatility. With capital still rotating to new projects, MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming the best bet in the next bull cycle.

He noted that a move above $4,000 would be a crucial development, potentially marking a key turning point for Ethereum‚Äôs momentum. Bearish Daily Close Mirrors Bitcoin‚Äôs Market Direction CRYPTOWZRD further explained that Ethereum and ETH/BTC‚Äôs daily candle bearish close followed Bitcoin‚Äôs lead. Despite the negative close, Ethereum displayed relative strength compared to most other cryptocurrencies, maintaining a more resilient structure amid the decline. This reflects the asset‚Äôs continued dominance in the altcoin market. Related Reading: Ethereum Turns Bullish After Multi-Year Breakout ‚Äî $7,000 May Be Imminent He noted that ETH/BTC has now reached its key support target zone. The market‚Äôs behavior around this level will be crucial in determining whether Ethereum is preparing for a rebound or remains at risk of deeper consolidation. A recovery toward $4,170 remains possible if Ethereum can hold this support region and sustain its current stability. The analyst highlighted that a move back above $4,000 would serve as an encouraging signal, validating a successful retest of the lower support area. Such a move could reignite bullish sentiment and set the stage for renewed upside momentum in the short to mid-term. However, CRYPTOWZRD cautioned that Bitcoin‚Äôs price movement will continue to dictate the broader market trend. Heading into the weekend, the analyst acknowledged that the market remains unpredictable, with both bullish and bearish scenarios still in play. His current focus, he stated, will remain on monitoring lower time frame chart formations to identify potential scalp opportunities. Extreme Volatility Hits As Market Faces Major Liquidation Event In his conclusion, CRYPTOWZRD noted that the intraday chart for Ethereum showed extreme volatility as the market experienced one of the most intense liquidation events in its history. Despite the turbulence, he emphasized that reclaiming the $4,000 level places Ethereum back in positive territory. Related Reading: Ethereum Faces TD Sell Signal At Key Resistance‚Äî$4,100 Next? He explained that a retest of the $4,260 intraday resistance could serve as a key turning point in the short term. This zone will be crucial in determining whether Ethereum can sustain its recovery or faces renewed downward pressure. If price action shows weakness after testing this level, it may open the door for short opportunities as momentum begins to fade. CRYPTOWZRD added that he remains open to both bullish and bearish scenarios, acknowledging that weekend trading often brings slower volatility and unpredictable market behavior. With that in mind, he stated that he will continue to monitor price movements, waiting for the next clear trade setup to emerge before making any decisive moves.
