Trump the Solana King (TRUMPKIN), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPKIN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Trump the Solana King can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump the Solana King could become the next viral memecoin. Trump the Solana King launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump the Solana King on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump the Solana King by entering its contract address ‚Äì 6oubDpkm3XF2x3r5vPZAhw2TABZgNrjmgwEqxUxLAYa ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPKIN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SOL|SHIB|BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-19 21:27:28

However, its success will depend on continued adoption, broader market adoption trends, and other cryptocurrency market space developments.

The network‚Äôs robust growth and expanding ecosystem make it a noteworthy player in the blockchain space. DeFi Llama ‚Äôs recent report shows that the L2 network has made significant achievements across multiple sectors. Base, A Rising Star in DeFi Space The DeFi space is growing fast, and Base has become the largest layer-2 network in the crypto world. It now hosts over 410 decentralized apps (dApps), revolutionizing how people use financial systems without relying on traditional banks. Key players in this thriving ecosystem include Aerodrome, Uniswap, Morpho Blue, and Moonwell. One of the standout protocols in the Base DeFi space is Morpho, a competitor to AAVE, which shows promise in decentralized lending and borrowing. Base‚Äôs activity is impressive, handling over $264 billion in transactions since its inception. More recently, transaction volume reached $12.2 billion in just one week, showcasing the high demand and utility of the network‚Äôs offerings. Speculatively, introducing Bitcoin-backed loans on Coinbase could further boost Base‚Äôs growth, pushing Morpho and other DeFi projects to new heights. Memecoins and NFTs Fuel Base‚Äôs Continued Success Base‚Äôs growth is not just about DeFi; its booming memecoin ecosystem also drives it . The memecoins are now worth over $2.6 billion, with tokens like Brett and Akuma Inu leading. NFTs are another highlight, with sales up 45% last week to $8.3 million and over 15,000 unique buyers. Cumulative NFT sales have exceeded $62 million, and the network handles over 40 million monthly transactions. These numbers place Base ahead of rivals like Arbitrum and Polygon. Base Expands Into AI and Gaming Sector In addition to its success in DeFi and NFTs, Base is expanding into emerging sectors such as artificial intelligence (AI) and gaming. This expansion is expected to open up new opportunities for developers and users, making Base an even more attractive platform for growth and innovation. Due to Base‚Äôs impressive expansion and strong user engagement, the network will likely achieve a substantial valuation. This is especially true if Coinbase rolls out the much-anticipated airdrop as part of its roadmap for 2025. The L2 scaling solution is set to become a major player in the layer-2 crypto space with an estimated fully diluted valuation (FDV) of $7 billion. This would place it ahead of competitors like Arbitrum, valued at $3.2 billion, and Optimism, at $2.47 billion. Such a valuation highlights its rapid growth and increasing importance in the DeFi ecosystem. If the trend continues, Base could solidify its position as a leader among layer-2 networks.

The altcoin, which rose above $70 during the day, fell to $40 with the latest decline. So what was the reason for this decline? As is known, TRUMP was officially launched yesterday morning by Donald Trump. The altcoin, which enabled Trump's wealth to increase fivefold at its peak, lost significant value minutes ago after Donald Trump's wife Melania Trump launched a memecoin called MELANIA.

At first, it was thought that Melania Trump's X and Truth Social accounts were hacked, but the tweets in question were also retweeted by Donald Trump's official X account.

This reform has been in progress for nearly a year and aims to align the foundation‚Äôs goals with the evolving needs of the Ethereum ecosystem. Vitalik Buterin shared on X that the changes are intended to fill gaps in technical expertise and improve the foundation‚Äôs collaboration with key ecosystem players, including developers, wallet providers, Layer-2 networks, and users. The updates also focus on enhancing decentralization, privacy, and open-source principles while advancing Ethereum‚Äôs role as a robust, censorship-resistant platform for decentralized applications. The foundation is also planning to integrate more decentralized technologies into its internal processes, such as payments and treasury management. Over the past year, the Ethereum Foundation has faced criticism for being too passive and concerns about its spending and operational priorities. These reforms aim to rebuild trust and strengthen relationships within the ecosystem. Buterin emphasized that the foundation will remain neutral and avoid political lobbying or catering to specific interests, preserving Ethereum‚Äôs position as a global platform. He reaffirmed EF‚Äôs dedication to empowering developers and fostering innovation rather than engaging in political influence. ‚ÄúThe Ethereum Foundation will not aggressively lobby regulators or political figures, especially in powerful countries like the USA. We must maintain Ethereum as a neutral global platform,‚Äù Buterin stated. In addition to Buterin‚Äôs remarks, co-founder Joseph Lubin proposed a dual-leadership model for guiding the foundation into its next phase. Lubin suggested that Ethereum developer Danny Ryan and Ethereum France President J√©r√¥me de Tychey take on leadership roles to balance technical and business strategies. Lubin highlighted their ability to navigate the challenges of the fast-changing blockchain industry while upholding Ethereum‚Äôs core principles. Lubin also stressed the importance of maintaining neutrality, likening Ethereum to Switzerland . Switzerland is a neutral nation that actively promotes its values and fosters international relationships . Lubin argued Ethereum could adopt a similar approach, championing its technological advancements while remaining impartial. He encouraged the community to advocate for Ethereum‚Äôs role in building a better future. Lubin concluded by emphasizing the need for energy, creativity, and determination in Ethereum‚Äôs leadership to ensure it continues to be the most trusted and versatile blockchain ecosystem. The proposed changes reflect a commitment to innovation, decentralization, and collaboration to better serve the Ethereum community and ecosystem.",,EN,0,0,ETH|BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-01-19 22:08:49

The China-owned platform announced that it was already restoring its services. The announcement was made amid reports that US users could access the platform service through its website but not the app. TikTok said : In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service. TikTok The popular social media platform thanked Trump for providing their service providers with clarity and assurance. They were grateful that they would face no penalties for providing the platform to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive. Trump proposes 50% stake of TikTok for America TikTok disappeared for its 170 million users in America on Saturday, a day before the shutdown order became effective. The company was shut down through a federal ban after the US cited National security interest. The US government officials warned that the platform exposes its data, so America‚Äôs data was at risk of being misused. However, the President-elect offered to extend the time frame before the ban takes effect so that America can cut a deal to protect its national security. Trump said that he desires the US to have a 50% ownership position on a joint venture of the fastest-growing social app. Trump said he would protect any company that helped TikTok from going dark through an executive order . Trump had earlier promised to give the platform a 90-day reprieve from the ban after he takes office, a promise the platform cited in a notice posted to users on the app. Trump‚Äôs approach to ensuring the continuity of TikTok in America is exciting and totally different from his first term in office when he issued an order to stop TikTok from operating in the US. The courts later revised the order. Trump also tried to have a deal to protect any data from TikTok reaching authorities in China. The East Asian country has a law that compels companies to submit data when the government demands it. The TikTok ban in the US stains China-US relations Although the TikTok ban was shortlived, it may have caused serious diplomatic wrangles between China and the US. Millions of Americans relied on the app for various initiatives, and the ban disrupted their routine. The app was already a symbol of culture to most users. Earlier, the platform released a brief statement from affected users, explaining that the Federal Reserve had passed a law banning its services in the US. The statement clarified that this was the reason America‚Äôs population could no longer access the platform. However, the users expressed optimism that the president-elect would collaborate with them to resolve the issue and reinstate TikTok. The statement also urged users to stay tuned for updates as had been removed from the Apple and Google app stores. Polymarket priced in a 95% chance of a TikTok ban going into effect TikTok ban and its developments found their way to Polymarket . The case of social media platforms was well represented on Polymarket. Would the app return? People were betting on it, and people were interested in the issue. The popular blockchain-based site Polymarket priced in a 95% chance of a TikTok ban going into effect in the U.S. by May, while its rival site Kalshi priced in 98% odds of a ban by May. The prediction platforms offer users the opportunity to wager on the outcomes of real-life events, purchasing contracts on either side of the outcome with odds moving accordingly based on the public money, similar to how a company‚Äôs share price changes as demand for buying and selling its stock moves. Many lost their bets when TikTok‚Äôs fate unexpectedly turned when they announced they would restore services. This outcome was a moment of relief and celebration for TikTok users, signaling the platform‚Äôs resilience amid challenges. It was a stark reminder for the betting platforms that even well-calculated odds can‚Äôt always account for the shifting tides of politics and diplomacy.

Its ICO was the talk of the crypto town, promising innovation, scalability, and a new way forward for blockchain technology. Those who got in early reaped the rewards as Cardano became one of the most prominent players in the crypto market. For the rest of us, though? It‚Äôs been a constant reminder of a golden opportunity missed. But here‚Äôs the thing about crypto: it‚Äôs full of second chances. Enter Qubetics, a project that‚Äôs redefining global finance with its innovative cross-border transaction solutions. With a presale that‚Äôs already making waves and the potential for explosive growth, Qubetics is positioning itself as one of the top cryptos to invest in January 2025 . If you missed out on Cardano, this is your chance to rewrite your crypto story. Cardano: The One That Set the Standard Cardano wasn‚Äôt just another blockchain project‚Äîit was a revolution. Launched in 2017, its focus on scalability, sustainability, and interoperability made it a standout in a crowded market. The project‚Äôs commitment to rigorous research and peer-reviewed development gave it an edge that few could match. During its ICO, Cardano‚Äôs ADA token was priced at just $0.02. Fast forward to today, and it‚Äôs become a staple in the portfolios of seasoned investors. Cardano‚Äôs rise wasn‚Äôt just about hype‚Äîit was a testament to the power of innovation and long-term vision. But for those of us who didn‚Äôt get in early, it‚Äôs been a tough pill to swallow. Watching Cardano‚Äôs success from the sidelines has been a constant reminder of what could have been. That‚Äôs why Qubetics feels like such a big deal‚Äîit‚Äôs the chance to get in early on something just as transformative.

Qubetics‚Äô presale has already raised over $9.9 million, with more than 425 million $TICS tokens sold . Analysts are predicting a post-launch price of $10-$15, which means early investors are staring at jaw-dropping ROI potential. This isn‚Äôt just a project with potential‚Äîit‚Äôs a project with momentum. And in the fast-paced world of crypto, that‚Äôs everything. Why Missing Qubetics Would Be Worse Than Missing Cardano We‚Äôve all felt the sting of a missed opportunity, but what if you could avoid it this time? Imagine scrolling through your news feed six months from now and seeing Qubetics dominating the headlines. The $TICS token is soaring, and early investors are cashing in on massive returns. Sound familiar? That‚Äôs exactly how Cardano played out for those who got in late‚Äîor not at all. But this time, you don‚Äôt have to be on the sidelines. Qubetics is still in its presale phase, which means the door is wide open. Don‚Äôt let this be another ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù moment. What Sets Qubetics Apart from the Crowd? While many blockchain projects focus on the here and now, Qubetics is building for the long term. Its cross-border transaction solution isn‚Äôt just innovative‚Äîit‚Äôs essential in a world that‚Äôs becoming increasingly interconnected. Qubetics isn‚Äôt just about hype‚Äîit‚Äôs about solving real problems. By making international payments faster, cheaper, and more transparent, it‚Äôs creating value for individuals, businesses, and financial institutions alike. What Happens If You Miss Qubetics? Let‚Äôs be real: missing Cardano hurt, but missing Qubetics could hurt even more. This isn‚Äôt just about financial returns‚Äîit‚Äôs about being part of a project that‚Äôs changing the game. The crypto world moves fast, and opportunities like this don‚Äôt come around often. If you‚Äôre looking for the top cryptos to invest in January 2025 , Qubetics isn‚Äôt just a good choice‚Äîit‚Äôs the choice. Conclusion: Your Second Chance Is Here Cardano taught us that timing is everything in crypto. Early investors saw life-changing returns, and the project became a benchmark for success. But if you missed the Cardano train, it‚Äôs time to stop looking back and start looking forward. Qubetics is here, and it‚Äôs offering a chance to be part of something truly transformative.

Related Reading: Bitcoin Reserve In The US: 65% Chance It Happens In 2025 Coinbase Reports Rise Of Altcoins Coinbase crypto exchange suggested that the upcoming massive market rally for altcoins could be on the way and might happen in the succeeding weeks after Trump returns to the White House. The crypto exchange released its latest weekly market commentary which provided its insights on Trump‚Äôs upcoming inauguration and its impact on the cryptocurrency landscape, saying that although the incoming American president is pro-crypto, it might take a while before ‚Äúall planned crypto-related policies on the agenda‚Äù will be fully implemented. However, Coinbase analysts noted that after Trump‚Äôs inauguration on January 20, they are expecting a surge in altcoins since, they believe, the digital asset space is preparing for a massive altcoin rally. The crypto exchange‚Äôs report stated that crypto traders might be strategically positioning themselves to fuel another growth spurt for altcoins under the Trump administration. According to Coinbase, the latest surge in altcoins is driven by a slight drop in the dominance of Bitcoin. ‚ÄúThe drop in BTC dominance from 58.5% to its support level of 57.3% during the inflation print relief rally on January 15 suggests to us that traders may be positioning for an outsized altcoin market rally on the back of positive catalysts for risk assets and crypto,‚Äù Coinbase explained in the report. BTC‚Äôs Fading Dominance A crypto analyst observed that the dominance of the world‚Äôs most popular cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, could be slightly dipping, a circumstance that allowed the latest altcoin pump. ‚ÄúImportantly for the long tail, $BTC dominance has been slowly fading since late November ‚Äô24 ‚Äì fireworks if that continues,‚Äù VC firm Placeholder partner and former ARK Invest crypto lead Chris Burniske said.

TRX, the network‚Äôs native currency, as well as WTRX, its wrapped version, experienced significant adoption due to decentralized finance (DeFi) activity. This was particularly seen on the Tron-based decentralized exchange (DEX), SunSwap, which sparked an influx of new tokens and increased transaction activity, which, in turn, aided in Tron‚Äôs diversification beyond stablecoin transactions. Tron‚Äôs Shift Beyond Stablecoin Transactions According to CryptoQuant‚Äôs latest analysis , the Tron network‚Äôs activity remains heavily influenced by USDT, which saw its supply increase from $48 billion to $62 billion in 2024. Over the same period, the value of USDT transfers surged from $362 billion to $576 billion. This was accompanied by a rise in monthly transfers from 55 million to 62 million. USDT continues to dominate as the most transferred asset and makes up 99% of token activity. Tron, however, reached a turning point in DeFi activity last year, with SunSwap leading the charge as the network‚Äôs most active decentralized exchange. By August, monthly transactions on SunSwap had climbed to 4 million, with 97% involving WTRX. From August through December, total swap transactions climbed to 8.3 million, reflecting a growth in DeFi engagement. Over 80% of these transactions involved WTRX, which saw its swap volume skyrocket from 4.2 billion to 20 billion units, or $4.1 billion, by year-end. The launch of meme coin generator SunPump further fueled network activity by simplifying meme coin creation, resulting in the introduction of 94,000 new tokens and a surge in transaction volumes. In another milestone, Tron also overtook Bitcoin as the most-used payment blockchain, ultimately securing 31.5% of all transactions. But, the developments failed to lift the price of TRX. TRX‚Äôs Short-Lived Recovery? TRX did see a resurgence last year, climbing back to the 10th spot in market capitalization as it instilled fresh confidence. The subsequent market corrections, however, pushed the asset‚Äôs price to $0.225, representing a nearly 50% decline from its recent all-time high of $0.43. Hopes for a local bottom also proved short-lived when TRX dropped below the $0.23 threshold.

Analyzing the recent price action, MEME‚Äôs price has fluctuated significantly over the past month, with notable resistance and support levels. The bearish trend has been consistent, but the increased trading volume could indicate the potential for a reversal. Despite the current market conditions, long-term projections remain bullish due to Memecoin‚Äôs fundamental potential and market positioning.

Immediate resistance lies at $0.010 and $0.011, while support is found at $0.0095 and $0.0088. Indicators suggest potential stabilization as bullish momentum emerges. Memecoin price analysis on January 19 shows the Memecoin (MEME) is trading at $0.009743, reflecting a 4.15% increase in the past 24 hours, with a trading volume of $138,696,780. This recent price movement has improved sentiment in the market, with MEME ranking #186 on CoinMarketCap, boasting a market capitalization of $355,908,478. The circulating supply stands at 36,529,798,454 MEME, with a maximum supply of 69,000,000,000 MEME coins. MEME/USD daily chart analysis: Consolidation with upside potential The daily chart highlights MEME‚Äôs attempt to break above its recent consolidation range. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 44.26 indicates neutral momentum, with a slight upward bias. The MACD line crossing above the signal line shows that buying pressure is starting to emerge. MEME/USD daily chart analysis: Consolidation with upside potential Resistance levels at $0.010 and $0.011 are critical for MEME to regain bullish momentum, while support at $0.0095 and $0.0088 provides a foundation for stabilization. MEME/USD 4-Hour Chart Analysis: Gradual Recovery In the 4-hour timeframe, MEME demonstrates a gradual recovery. The Awesome Oscillator‚Äôs green bars suggest that momentum is building, albeit at a slow pace. MEME/USD 4-hour chart analysis: Gradual recovery The ADX indicates weak trend strength, underscoring the need for a breakout above $0.010 to solidify bullish sentiment. The SMA-9 at $0.0096 provides immediate dynamic support, aligning with the $0.0095 support level. On the 4-hour chart, MEME has shown signs of recovery after testing key support levels near $0.0090. The Awesome Oscillator (AO) indicates the formation of bullish momentum, as the histogram has turned green above the zero line. The Average Directional Index (ADX) at 22.69, however, suggests that the trend strength remains weak, leaving room for further confirmation of upward momentum. Immediate resistance lies at $0.010 and $0.011, while $0.0095 and $0.0088 serve as support zones. What to expect from Memecoin price analysis If MEME sustains its current momentum, it could target resistance at $0.010 and $0.011 in the short term. A breakout above $0.011 would pave the way for a potential rally toward $0.012. However, a failure to maintain support at $0.0095 could trigger a retest of $0.0088, risking further downside. Given Memecoin‚Äôs growing market capitalization and liquidity, long-term investors may view current levels as an accumulation opportunity.

Memecoin (MEME) shows mixed signals, making it a speculative investment at the current stage. The token trades at $0.0114, reflecting minor consolidation, with short-term resistance at $0.01157 and strong support at $0.01111. While the price has stabilized following a prior downtrend, broader technical indicators suggest market indecision. Despite this, Memecoin has displayed resilience, holding key support levels and gradually building momentum. Is Memecoin a good investment? Investing in MEME coins can be considered a strategic move for those looking to tap into the viral nature of meme-driven assets. These coins often see rapid appreciation or decrease in value driven by social media trends and community enthusiasm, which can lead to substantial short-term gains. The appeal of MEME coin lies in its potential to capitalize on the widespread attention and excitement surrounding viral tokens, making it an attractive option for investors adept at navigating the volatile crypto market and timing their trades to optimize returns. Will Memecoin recover? Based on the chart and the recent upward movement, Memecoin shows signs of recovery. If this positive trend continues, Memecoin has the potential for further recovery. Will Memecoin reach 10? Given its current price levels and market trends, Meme coin prediction is highly unlikely to reach $10 for Memecoin. Will Memecoin reach 100? Reaching $100 for Memecoin is extremely improbable due to its current price levels and the enormous market capitalization required. Such a drastic increase in prices would necessitate unprecedented growth and adoption. Does Memecoin have a good long-term future? Based on data and the recent upward movement, Memecoin may have the potential for a good long-term future. Positive market trends, adoption, and development will be crucial for its success.

Meanwhile, Memecoin is expected to reach a minimum price of $0.0100. The maximum price may reach $0.0245 in 2025. Memecoin historic price sentiment Memecoin was launched on 28th October by the renowned internet humor platform 9GAG and has quickly become a significant player in the meme coin market. The Memecoin garnered immense popularity through a unique launch strategy involving a fire sale and strategic social media airdrops to cultivate a robust and dedicated community. This approach proved highly successful. The fire sale raised over $11 million and sold more than 11.4 billion MEME tokens at $0.001 each, representing a 150% surge from what the team initially planned. Looking at its price history since 27th October 2020, MEME saw its first price pump on the same day, reaching a high of $0.02868. The MEME token price remained above $0.0020 until 7 November, when a minor pullback occurred below the $0.0200 level. By April 2021, the price skyrocketed, reaching an all-time high of over $0.05 as meme-driven tokens gained massive popularity due to social media hype and celebrity endorsements. However, following this rally, the price retraced sharply by June 2021, stabilizing around $0.02-$0.03. After a quiet 2022, Memecoin regained attention in 2023 due to renewed interest in memecoins and a crypto market recovery. A mid-year rally faced resistance, stabilizing at $0.015‚Äì$0.02, but by year-end, the price stagnated amid regulatory scrutiny and waning investor enthusiasm. In 2024, MEME saw price fluctuations: recovering to $0.026 in January with a crypto market surge, dropping to $0.012 by July amid weak sentiment, and rebounding to $0.017 in November with community-driven campaigns, ending the year trading between $0.01624 and $0.018. In January 2025, Memecoin‚Äôs price is hovering around $0.01128 ‚Äì $0.0116.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|MEME|SHIB|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-19 22:42:50

Elon Manipulates Trump (ELTRUMP), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELTRUMP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon Manipulates Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Manipulates Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Manipulates Trump launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.

The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

Trump promised to free Ross Ulbricht during his campaign days Speaking at the Libertarian Party‚Äôs National Convention on May 25, 2024, Donald Trump promised to commute the sentence of Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht on his first day in office. He made the same promise at the 2024 Bitcoin Conference in July 2024. Bitcoin enthusiasts still believe that Trump will keep his word and release Ross within his first 100 days in office. Bets on Kalshi even put Ross at an 81% chance of a presidential pardon, while on Polymarket‚Äôs prediction market, Ross‚Äôs odds of a Trump pardon are at 79%. Not to mention, his wife has hinted that Ross is preparing to leave jail soon. She posted on his behalf on his X account, saying: For my last monthly resolution of 2024, I intend to study every day and to get up to speed as much as I can as I prepare for freedom. Ross Similarly, on November 12, 2024, Ross thanked Trump, saying he could finally see light after 11 years of darkness. Ulbricht wrote a letter to Biden asking for a presidential pardon In 2013, Ulbricht was arrested, with officials having to close his Silk Road and seize over 174000 Bitcoin. Ulbricht was then charged with operating a criminal enterprise, conspiracy to money laundering and computer hacking, and identity fraud. In May 2015, he received a life sentence despite pleading for leniency. Years later, Ross wrote to President Joe Biden asking for pardon. He claimed he started the Silk Road with good intentions and simply pushed for his libertarian beliefs. He also promised to remain law-abiding when released.

Cardano‚Äôs ADA price has climbed past $1 due to its ecosystem advancements and strategic initiatives. At the same time, TRON‚Äôs price has reached new highs, drawing investor interest with consistent gains. Among these shifts, Web3Bay (3BAY) stands out, transforming e-commerce with blockchain. Unlike others reliant on speculation, 3BAY offers real utility, adding real value for its users and early backers. Web3Bay‚Äôs 6430% ROI Potential Shouldn‚Äôt Be Ignored Web3Bay is rapidly gaining recognition in the cryptocurrency world for its innovative approach to decentralizing e-commerce. This blockchain-based platform provides a secure, transparent, and cost-effective marketplace for both buyers and sellers, eliminating the hefty fees typical of traditional platforms. Additionally, the 3BAY token not only facilitates transactions but also offers special advantages such as discounts and governance rights.

Furthermore, Web3Bay is at the forefront of pioneering developments like decentralized storage and cross-chain functionality, establishing itself as a leader in the Web3 e-commerce arena. For those looking for an investment with substantial growth potential and practical application, Web3Bay represents an exceptional opportunity that is too good to miss. ADA Price Climbs Past $1 with Growing Ecosystem Cardano‚Äôs ADA recently surpassed the $1 threshold, part of a wider market recovery, with digital currencies gaining momentum as Bitcoin nears the $100,000 mark. Analysts see ADA potentially rising toward $2 amid a bullish pattern of development. Cardano is seeing major ecosystem developments, with founder Charles Hoskinson joining a new crypto policy team, signaling a significant step for Cardano and wider blockchain usage. The Midnight project further expands Cardano‚Äôs privacy and interoperability, tackling real-world integration and regulatory challenges. TRON Price Reaches New Peak TRON (TRX) has seen significant price changes recently, drawing the interest of both investors and market analysts. On January 17, 2025, TRX was trading at around $0.2444, marking a 2.82% rise from its last close. This increase is part of a wider positive movement within the cryptocurrency market. Ongoing development efforts and strategic alliances are believed to bolster TRON‚Äôs durability and future expansion prospects. Nonetheless, experts warn that the market is still prone to swift shifts, and they recommend that investors keep up-to-date with TRON-specific updates and broader market trends. In summary, the rise in TRON‚Äôs price to $0.2444 highlights its active presence in the cryptocurrency sector. Although the current trend seems favorable, those participating in the market should engage in detailed research and proceed with caution in their investment choices. Final Say! The rise in ADA‚Äôs price bolsters its appeal for the long term, though its future remains uncertain. TRON‚Äôs recent price surge demonstrates its tenacity, albeit without notable distinctiveness. In contrast, Web3Bay stands out with its practical use in e-commerce and its impressive potential for a 6,430% ROI for early investors, setting it apart from others. By integrating blockchain technology with global retail, Web3Bay is not only introducing innovation but also delivering real value where it‚Äôs most needed.

Musk AI Boost (MUSKAIBO), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKAIBO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk AI Boost can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk AI Boost could become the next viral memecoin. Musk AI Boost launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk AI Boost on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk AI Boost by entering its contract address ‚Äì 72pTcxNcaiTgNRSbCHaAPS97WFRdWwpfqbQdqEi7JP8J ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKAIBO.

Is this a good idea?,https://crypto.news/over-50-americans-sell-gold-or-stocks-to-buy-bitcoin/,"Most people who read about cryptocurrencies know that Bitcoin, due to its characteristics, is often referred to as ‚Äòdigital gold.‚Äô A new study reveals that more and more people in the U.S. prefer Bitcoin to gold. The GameFi platform ChainPlay conducted a joint survey with Storible. In their study, they asked 1,428 Americans about cryptocurrencies and investments in their lives. According to the report , over 68% of Americans now own some crypto. 77% consider increasing their crypto investment in 2025. 60% of crypto investors believe the value of their assets will double in 2025. The survey shows that 50% of crypto owners are boomers, while nearly 30% are millennials, and the rest are Gen Z. The report authors conclude that crypto owners get younger. However, it is not clear what digits were used as a reference point. The total lack of Gen X representatives in this report raises questions. Now that‚Äôs the real lost generation! Unfortunately, the report doesn‚Äôt specify what the groups of respondents were and how ChainPlay and Storible chose who to survey. According to other sources, only 13% of Americans owned crypto as of November 2024. It seems that the number heavily depends on the methodology. New crypto investment stats A survey revealed that Trump‚Äôs victory made a serious impact on people‚Äôs perception of cryptocurrencies, with 38% of respondents deciding to invest in crypto following the election outcome. A huge amount of these people, 84%, are first-time buyers who decided to try fortunes in crypto after the win of the pro-crypto candidate. Now, it‚Äôs time to talk more closely about the BTC investment insights found in the report. There are three main points. First, 51% of Americans allocate over 30% of their assets in meme coins. That‚Äôs an interesting statistic proving that a booming meme token market is no joke. The second point notes that one-fifth of Americans allocate over 30% of their investment in crypto. And, finally, third‚Äìnearly 52% of responders admitted they were selling gold or stocks to invest in Bitcoin. The latter revelation illustrates the tectonic shift in people‚Äôs minds. Over half of all respondents believe now that Bitcoin is here to stay, and it is safer and probably more profitable than gold or stocks. The preference for Bitcoin over gold or stocks was still a marginal mindset during the 2017 bull run. Nowadays, when various governments across the globe announce they will mine or stock bitcoins or use it for international payments, people look at Bitcoin without prejudice. On top of that, the stats mean that these people not only decided to buy some BTC, but they have made an additional step of dumping their traditional assets to invest in BTC first. According to the survey, over 51% of such people are in America. It shows the unprecedented bullishness of digital gold. You might also like: Mark Cuban chooses Bitcoin over Gold as economic hedge Bitcoin and gold The ‚Äúdigital gold‚Äù name has its grounds, of course. Bitcoin bears certain similarities with gold. Both assets are scarce and deflationary. There will not be more gold or more Bitcoin in the future. The amount of both assets is finite and isn‚Äôt likely to increase. You have probably heard about the preset Bitcoin mining reward shrinks in two once every four years (so-called halving). The gold mining is decreasing too, however, the speed at which the gold mining drops is far behind Bitcoin‚Äôs increasing scarcity. Experts speculate whether humanity reached the ‚Äúgold peak‚Äù point (a moment after which gold mining will be constantly dropping). In the Bitcoin case, the Bitcoin peak was in the first years, and then, production has always gone down, making Bitcoin scarcer than gold. When gold mining drops by a couple of percent, Bitcoin may drop by 50%. More than that, after every coin is mined, Bitcoin may be going to the moon, and the gold diggers may literally start mining gold on the moon, increasing the total supply available for the Earth‚Äôs markets. While gold gets increasingly scarce due to its use in devices, jewelry, and other products, bitcoins get lost or blocked forever. The speed at which bitcoins get stuck has been so high that in 16 years of Bitcoin‚Äôs existence, around 20% of all units are considered lost. ‚ö°Ô∏èMARK CUBAN: ‚Äú #Bitcoin ‚Äì it became a store of value, it‚Äôs marketed that way and has been marketed for the last 15 years or whatever it is and it‚Äôs gotten to a point of acceptance just like gold.‚Äù pic.twitter.com/w3h2fjEnps ‚Äî Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) January 4, 2025 According to businessman and TV personality Mark Cuban, Bitcoin became a store of value and reached an acceptance level comparable to gold. Both he and MicroStrategy‚Äôs frontman Michael Saylor point out that in contrast to gold, Bitcoin is easy to transport and generally control. Read more: Mark Cuban chooses Bitcoin over Gold as economic hedge Saylor once offered a thought experiment in which we should imagine trying to bring a substantial amount of gold or cash to the plane. The airport officers will treat owners as thieves. The same happens if we try to send a large amount of money abroad via a wire transfer. Saylor notes that, unlike traditional assets, Bitcoin provides owners with autonomy and control over their funds. Michael Saylor on Gold vs Fiat vs #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/9UNtVe0M8x ‚Äî Vivek‚ö°Ô∏è (@Vivek4real_) January 16, 2025 In another instance, Saylor noted that the gold era ended in the 16th century when other means of payment became more popular. However, Cuban‚Äôs estimation, in which he rather puts Bitcoin in line with gold, seems to be less maximalist as people still invest in gold while it‚Äôs obvious that it is Bitcoin, not gold, that is going through the blooming phase. The possible downside of Bitcoin is its higher volatility and shorter market history. However, as of 2025, its ups have always been more prominent than downs.

Stellar has seen a steady climb thanks to its appeal in international transactions, while Dogecoin‚Äôs price is on an upward trajectory, supported by major buying from big holders. Stellar is on the verge of hitting $0.50, generating enthusiasm from big-money players, and Dogecoin might soon reach $3, exciting market watchers. Amid these developments, Web3Bay (3BAY) is introducing a significant shift‚Äîa practical approach to solving real issues in international e-commerce. By merging blockchain with decentralized control, Web3Bay is setting up a marketplace that lowers costs, boosts clarity, and gives power to its users. With over $830,000 collected and a projected 6,430% ROI for early buyers, Web3Bay is not just following trends; it‚Äôs shaping the future of commerce. Web3Bay‚Äôs Blueprint for Tomorrow‚Äôs Global Trading Web3Bay is more than a marketplace; it‚Äôs a blueprint for the future of trading. While old platforms often put earnings before user experience, Web3Bay is rewriting this story. It combines decentralized storage, works across multiple blockchains, and uses Layer-2 scaling to create lasting infrastructure. Its hybrid payment approach, accepting cryptocurrencies and mainstream options like PayPal and Apple Pay, makes it accessible worldwide. Priced at just $0.0045626 in its fourth presale phase, the 3BAY token has already secured over $830,000. With each phase, the token‚Äôs price goes up, leading to a launch price of $0.1959‚Äîa potential return of over 6,430% for early buyers. The roadmap is exciting, too, with plans for an NFT marketplace and staking for 3BAY holders, offering more ways to engage with the ecosystem. As the presale picks up pace, Web3Bay is proving it‚Äôs more than just a concept; it‚Äôs a real answer to the shortcomings of traditional e-commerce. Early backers are not just investors but pioneers of a movement focusing on clarity, safety, and user empowerment. The Web3Bay revolution is here, making now the ideal time to get involved. Stellar Price Rises Amid Market Optimism As of January 16, 2025, Stellar‚Äôs price stands at $0.482793, up by 1.08% from its last close. The cryptocurrency saw a daily high of $0.514258 and a low of $0.4715, showing significant price swings. The recent price increase fits with overall positive market sentiment, as players look forward to favorable regulation and more interest from big investors. Stellar‚Äôs efficient handling of international payments keeps drawing financial and tech interest. Experts think Stellar might soon test the $0.50 resistance if the momentum holds. However, they remind potential buyers that the market‚Äôs unpredictable nature demands thorough research before any purchase decisions. Can Dogecoin Price Reach $3 Soon? Recently, Dogecoin‚Äôs price has seen notable movements. As of January 17, 2025, DOGE trades at about $0.4061, marking a 7.78% rise from its previous close. It touched a high and low of $0.4061 and $0.3688 on the same day. This uptrend coincides with overall market movements, including Bitcoin‚Äôs recent jump past $107,000. Significant buying by large holders, acquiring 200 million DOGE in just 48 hours, shows strong bullish sentiment. Analysts suggest that if Dogecoin continues this momentum and breaks past the $0.40 mark, it could aim for a $3 value. Still, the known volatility of the crypto market warrants caution from investors. Final Remarks! While Stellar‚Äôs durability and Dogecoin‚Äôs significant buys underscore the market‚Äôs speculative nature, neither offers the comprehensive utility that Web3Bay delivers. The 3BAY token is the core of a decentralized marketplace aimed at revolutionizing traditional e-commerce . Currently priced at $0.0045626 in its fourth presale phase, 3BAY presents unmatched growth potential, with a projected launch price of $0.1959. As Web3Bay continues to grow, early supporters gain both financial benefits and a stake in a game-changing ecosystem. For those seeking a high-growth opportunity with a real impact, Web3Bay emerges as the premier choice.

Particularly, data from blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock shows that Ethereum whales now hold about 43% of the total circulating supply of ETH. The imbalance in ETH holdings raises important questions about its implications for Ethereum‚Äôs price and market dynamics moving forward. Whale Accumulation Surges By Over 90% Since Early 2023 According to IntoTheBlock, the total concentration of ETH in whale addresses is currently at 61.09 ETH, which represents about 43% of the total supply. This marks a significant shift from early 2023, when whales held just 22% of Ethereum‚Äôs circulating supply. IntoTheBlock classifies whale addresses as those holding more than 1% of the total circulating supply of ETH. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bulls Eye $3 As Whales Scoop 200 Million DOGE In The Last 2 Days The nearly twofold increase in Ethereum whale holdings within just a year is a noteworthy development. Naturally, such a concentration of a large supply of cryptocurrency into a few wallets would spell doom for the asset, as it would mean a few players would be able to manipulate price dynamics as they wish. However, Ethereum‚Äôs case deviates from this narrative due to the unique nature of its ecosystem and recent structural shifts within the network since 2022. The sharp rise in whale concentration can be attributed to two major factors: the Ethereum merge and the growing appeal of ETH staking to earn rewards. The Ethereum merge, which took place in 2022, transitioned the blockchain from a proof-of-work (PoW) system to a proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism. As such, in-depth data from IntoTheBlock, which shows the 61.09 million ETH concentrated in only three whale addresses, makes much sense. What this means is that these ETH are mostly those locked in the proof-of-stake staking algorithm used by block validators on the Ethereum network. By locking up their Ethereum, ETH miners and large holders have not only reduced the circulating supply but also contribute to price appreciation by reducing the amount of Ethereum available for trading. Ethereum Holder Dynamics ‚Äì Investors And Retailers The increase in ETH among whale addresses has meant less ETH is available for investors and retail owners. IntoTheBlock classifies investors as addresses holding between 0.1% and 1% of the total circulating supply, while retail are those with less than 0.1% of the total circulating supply. At the time of writing, there are 42 investor addresses and they collectively own 15.2 million ETH, which translates to 10.77% of the total circulating supply. Keeping in mind that the three whale addresses do not do much with price dynamics, investor addresses holding significant but more liquid portions of ETH have a greater capacity to affect market movements. Any substantial selloff from these investor addresses could trigger a sharp decline in Ethereum‚Äôs price.

At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $3,225 and is down by 2% in the past 24 hours.

Its chairman Michael Saylor has teased another Bitcoin purchase is on the horizon. With Bitcoin‚Äôs value soaring, currently sitting at around $101,490, the company‚Äôs holdings are now worth an impressive $47.3 billion. Its calculated investment strategy is paying off, with a 69% return, thanks to its relentless accumulation of Bitcoin over time. MicroStrategy‚Äôs ongoing focus on Bitcoin comes as both big institutions and individual investors show increasing interest in the digital asset. MicroStrategy Massive Bitcoin Hoard Michael Saylor has been very open about the company‚Äôs Bitcoin plans. Every week, for 11 weeks in a row, he posted hints about the company‚Äôs Bitcoin purchases. On January 19, he shared a Bitcoin chart, signaling that the firm is planning to buy more soon. Just a few days earlier, the company bought 2,530 BTC worth $243 million that pushed its Bitcoin stash to 450,000 BTC valued at a whopping $47.3 billion. The company‚Äôs plan is part of its 21/21 initiative, a bold move to raise $42 billion through equity and fixed-income securities to fund Bitcoin purchases. Recently, the company announced the plans to raise another $2 billion through a perpetual preferred stock offering to fuel its Bitcoin buying spree. This strategy underscores a long-term vision where Bitcoin is not just an asset but the foundation of MicroStrategy‚Äôs financial future. Saylor‚Äôs Push for a U.S. Bitcoin Reserve Michael Saylor, who has signaled his willingness to join America‚Äôs new political era, is not alone in his vision for Bitcoin. He has repeatedly suggested that the U.S. should consider adopting Bitcoin as a Strategic Reserve Asset (SRA). In a framework he presented in December 2024, Saylor argued that converting the U.S. Treasury‚Äôs gold holdings into Bitcoin would fortify the U.S dollar and neutralize the national debt. His plan even included an ambitious goal to create an $81 trillion Bitcoin strategic reserve. According to Saylor‚Äôs framework, such a move could propel Bitcoin markets to a $10 trillion market capitalization. Also, the overall digital asset capital markets could expand to $280 trillion. Above all, it would position the country as the dominant global force in the digital economy. A Call for Bitcoin Reserves The MicroStrategy Chairman‚Äôs ideas are not going unnoticed. Industry leaders, including Coinbase CEO Brain Armstrong and asset manager Anthony Pompliano, have joined the conversation. In a recent statement, Pompliano urged the U.S. government to acquire as much Bitcoin as possible, emphasizing the situation‚Äôs urgency. He warned that if the U.S. does not act quickly, it could be outpaced by other nations in the race to secure Bitcoin as a reserve asset. With countries like China already taking bold steps to integrate Bitcoin into their economies , the pressure is on the U.S. to act or risk falling behind.

They incentivize word-of-mouth marketing by rewarding users for inviting others into the fold. Not only does this build trust, but it also fuels organic growth. Crypto thrives on community, and referral programs ensure that growth is a collective effort. It‚Äôs a win-win‚Äîusers earn rewards, and projects get exposure to new audiences. Meme coins, in particular, have embraced referral programs as a way to amplify their reach. From Dogecoin‚Äôs viral beginnings to Shiba Inu‚Äôs expansive ecosystem, the biggest players know the value of community-driven promotion. Now, a new wave of meme coins is upping the ante. BTFD Coin (BTFD) stands out as a project poised to redefine the game with its robust referral program, Play-to-Earn (P2E) games, and high-yield staking rewards. Alongside Neiro and Non-Playable Coin (NPC), BTFD represents the best new meme coins to buy for 2025 . With its explosive presale performance and promising features, BTFD is primed to lead the next generation of meme coins. Meanwhile, Neiro and NPC each bring their unique flavor to the mix, offering investors multiple avenues for growth and engagement. Let‚Äôs dive deeper into what makes these projects special. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin Revolution BTFD Coin isn‚Äôt just another meme coin‚Äîit‚Äôs an ecosystem built for growth, engagement, and massive ROI. With its presale already raising ove r $5.2 million and selling more than 64 billion coins to 8,600 holders, BTFD has captured the attention of analysts and investors alike. At its current Stage 13 price of $0.000142, the opportunity to get in early is quickly slippin g away. One of BTFD‚Äôs standout features is its referral program . It‚Äôs simple: users share a unique link, and every successful referral earns them rewards. It‚Äôs not just a marketing tool; it‚Äôs a way to grow the community organically while putting more tokens in the hands of dedicated supporters. The program has been instrumental in driving BTFD‚Äôs presale success, creating a snowball effect of interest and investment. But there‚Äôs more to BTFD than referrals. Its P2E game offers a fun and interactive way for users to earn tokens while staying engaged with the ecosystem. Players can complete challenges, unlock rewards, and grow their portfolios‚Äîall while enjoying an immersive gaming experience. Combined with staking rewards boasting an eye-popping 90% APY, BTFD ensures that every holder has multiple ways to profit. Let‚Äôs talk numbers. An investment of $ 35,000 at the current Stage 13 price would secure 246,478,873 BTFD coins. Once the presale ends and the coin is listed at $0.0006, that investment could grow to an impressive $147,887. Stage 13 is already over 96% complete, so this price won‚Äôt stick around much longer. What‚Äôs more, this coin is poised to hit $0.006 post launch, taking the ROI to a whopping 4000%. Joining the presale is easy. Just visit BTFD‚Äôs Presale Page , connect your wallet, input your details, and confirm the transaction. With its innovative features and explosive potential, BTFD Coin is a no-brainer for investors seeking long-term gains. Neiro (NEIRO): AI Meets Meme Culture Neiro is carving out its own space in the meme coin world by merging artificial intelligence (AI) with community-driven innovation. Its branding is bold, its utility is forward-thinking, and its potential has analysts buzzing. Unlike traditional meme coins that rely solely on humor and community, Neiro integrates AI tools designed to enhance user experience and engagement. One of Neiro‚Äôs standout features is its AI-powered trading assistant, which provides real-time market insights and predictive analytics to help users make informed decisions. This isn‚Äôt just a gimmick; it‚Äôs a game-changing feature that adds real utility to the project. Neiro‚Äôs ecosystem also includes NFT integrations and plans for a decentralized application (dApp) that leverages AI for gamified interactions. Crypto analysts are optimistic about Neiro‚Äôs trajectory, citing its innovative use of AI as a major differentiator. However, while Neiro‚Äôs tech-forward approach is impressive, it lacks the robust financial incentives like high-yield staking or referral rewards that make BTFD so compelling. Still, for investors who value utility and innovation, Neiro is a strong contender. Non-Playable Coin (NPC): Humor and Community at Its Core Non-Playable Coin (NPC) embraces its meme roots wholeheartedly, offering a lighthearted approach to crypto investing. Its branding pokes fun at internet culture while fostering a tight-knit community of holders who share a love for all things quirky. NPC‚Äôs charm lies in its simplicity. The project doesn‚Äôt try to overcomplicate things‚Äîit‚Äôs about humor, engagement, and building a loyal following. Its ecosystem includes meme contests, community events, and plans for exclusive NFT drops that celebrate the NPC theme. The project thrives on social media buzz, with users actively sharing memes and promoting the coin organically. While NPC has carved out a niche for itself, it doesn‚Äôt offer the same depth of features as BTFD or the innovation of Neiro. Its growth is heavily reliant on community engagement, making it a riskier bet for investors seeking long-term returns. That said, NPC‚Äôs loyal fanbase ensures a steady level of interest, making it a fun option for those who value community-driven projects. Why BTFD Coin is the Smartest Investment Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin stands head and shoulders above its competitors as the best new meme coin to buy for 2025 . Its referral program, high-yield staking, and engaging P2E game make it a comprehensive option for both casual and serious investors. While Neiro impresses with its AI-driven approach and NPC captures the humor of meme culture, neither offers the same level of financial incentives or growth potential as BTFD. Join the BTFD Coin presale now and secure your spot in what could be one of the most profitable crypto projects of the year. With every passing stage, the price inches closer to its $0.0006 listing value. Don‚Äôt miss your chance to turn today‚Äôs investment into tomorrow‚Äôs success. Make the most of this wealth-generation opportunity with BTFD Coin.
