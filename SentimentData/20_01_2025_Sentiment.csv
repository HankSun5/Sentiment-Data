Trump the Solana King (TRUMPKIN), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPKIN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Trump the Solana King can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump the Solana King could become the next viral memecoin. Trump the Solana King launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump the Solana King on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump the Solana King by entering its contract address ‚Äì 6oubDpkm3XF2x3r5vPZAhw2TABZgNrjmgwEqxUxLAYa ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPKIN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SOL|SHIB|BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-19 21:27:28

However, its success will depend on continued adoption, broader market adoption trends, and other cryptocurrency market space developments.

The network‚Äôs robust growth and expanding ecosystem make it a noteworthy player in the blockchain space. DeFi Llama ‚Äôs recent report shows that the L2 network has made significant achievements across multiple sectors. Base, A Rising Star in DeFi Space The DeFi space is growing fast, and Base has become the largest layer-2 network in the crypto world. It now hosts over 410 decentralized apps (dApps), revolutionizing how people use financial systems without relying on traditional banks. Key players in this thriving ecosystem include Aerodrome, Uniswap, Morpho Blue, and Moonwell. One of the standout protocols in the Base DeFi space is Morpho, a competitor to AAVE, which shows promise in decentralized lending and borrowing. Base‚Äôs activity is impressive, handling over $264 billion in transactions since its inception. More recently, transaction volume reached $12.2 billion in just one week, showcasing the high demand and utility of the network‚Äôs offerings. Speculatively, introducing Bitcoin-backed loans on Coinbase could further boost Base‚Äôs growth, pushing Morpho and other DeFi projects to new heights. Memecoins and NFTs Fuel Base‚Äôs Continued Success Base‚Äôs growth is not just about DeFi; its booming memecoin ecosystem also drives it . The memecoins are now worth over $2.6 billion, with tokens like Brett and Akuma Inu leading. NFTs are another highlight, with sales up 45% last week to $8.3 million and over 15,000 unique buyers. Cumulative NFT sales have exceeded $62 million, and the network handles over 40 million monthly transactions. These numbers place Base ahead of rivals like Arbitrum and Polygon. Base Expands Into AI and Gaming Sector In addition to its success in DeFi and NFTs, Base is expanding into emerging sectors such as artificial intelligence (AI) and gaming. This expansion is expected to open up new opportunities for developers and users, making Base an even more attractive platform for growth and innovation. Due to Base‚Äôs impressive expansion and strong user engagement, the network will likely achieve a substantial valuation. This is especially true if Coinbase rolls out the much-anticipated airdrop as part of its roadmap for 2025. The L2 scaling solution is set to become a major player in the layer-2 crypto space with an estimated fully diluted valuation (FDV) of $7 billion. This would place it ahead of competitors like Arbitrum, valued at $3.2 billion, and Optimism, at $2.47 billion. Such a valuation highlights its rapid growth and increasing importance in the DeFi ecosystem. If the trend continues, Base could solidify its position as a leader among layer-2 networks.

The altcoin, which rose above $70 during the day, fell to $40 with the latest decline. So what was the reason for this decline? As is known, TRUMP was officially launched yesterday morning by Donald Trump. The altcoin, which enabled Trump's wealth to increase fivefold at its peak, lost significant value minutes ago after Donald Trump's wife Melania Trump launched a memecoin called MELANIA.

At first, it was thought that Melania Trump's X and Truth Social accounts were hacked, but the tweets in question were also retweeted by Donald Trump's official X account.

This reform has been in progress for nearly a year and aims to align the foundation‚Äôs goals with the evolving needs of the Ethereum ecosystem. Vitalik Buterin shared on X that the changes are intended to fill gaps in technical expertise and improve the foundation‚Äôs collaboration with key ecosystem players, including developers, wallet providers, Layer-2 networks, and users. The updates also focus on enhancing decentralization, privacy, and open-source principles while advancing Ethereum‚Äôs role as a robust, censorship-resistant platform for decentralized applications. The foundation is also planning to integrate more decentralized technologies into its internal processes, such as payments and treasury management. Over the past year, the Ethereum Foundation has faced criticism for being too passive and concerns about its spending and operational priorities. These reforms aim to rebuild trust and strengthen relationships within the ecosystem. Buterin emphasized that the foundation will remain neutral and avoid political lobbying or catering to specific interests, preserving Ethereum‚Äôs position as a global platform. He reaffirmed EF‚Äôs dedication to empowering developers and fostering innovation rather than engaging in political influence. ‚ÄúThe Ethereum Foundation will not aggressively lobby regulators or political figures, especially in powerful countries like the USA. We must maintain Ethereum as a neutral global platform,‚Äù Buterin stated. In addition to Buterin‚Äôs remarks, co-founder Joseph Lubin proposed a dual-leadership model for guiding the foundation into its next phase. Lubin suggested that Ethereum developer Danny Ryan and Ethereum France President J√©r√¥me de Tychey take on leadership roles to balance technical and business strategies. Lubin highlighted their ability to navigate the challenges of the fast-changing blockchain industry while upholding Ethereum‚Äôs core principles. Lubin also stressed the importance of maintaining neutrality, likening Ethereum to Switzerland . Switzerland is a neutral nation that actively promotes its values and fosters international relationships . Lubin argued Ethereum could adopt a similar approach, championing its technological advancements while remaining impartial. He encouraged the community to advocate for Ethereum‚Äôs role in building a better future. Lubin concluded by emphasizing the need for energy, creativity, and determination in Ethereum‚Äôs leadership to ensure it continues to be the most trusted and versatile blockchain ecosystem. The proposed changes reflect a commitment to innovation, decentralization, and collaboration to better serve the Ethereum community and ecosystem.",,EN,0,0,ETH|BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-01-19 22:08:49

The China-owned platform announced that it was already restoring its services. The announcement was made amid reports that US users could access the platform service through its website but not the app. TikTok said : In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service. TikTok The popular social media platform thanked Trump for providing their service providers with clarity and assurance. They were grateful that they would face no penalties for providing the platform to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive. Trump proposes 50% stake of TikTok for America TikTok disappeared for its 170 million users in America on Saturday, a day before the shutdown order became effective. The company was shut down through a federal ban after the US cited National security interest. The US government officials warned that the platform exposes its data, so America‚Äôs data was at risk of being misused. However, the President-elect offered to extend the time frame before the ban takes effect so that America can cut a deal to protect its national security. Trump said that he desires the US to have a 50% ownership position on a joint venture of the fastest-growing social app. Trump said he would protect any company that helped TikTok from going dark through an executive order . Trump had earlier promised to give the platform a 90-day reprieve from the ban after he takes office, a promise the platform cited in a notice posted to users on the app. Trump‚Äôs approach to ensuring the continuity of TikTok in America is exciting and totally different from his first term in office when he issued an order to stop TikTok from operating in the US. The courts later revised the order. Trump also tried to have a deal to protect any data from TikTok reaching authorities in China. The East Asian country has a law that compels companies to submit data when the government demands it. The TikTok ban in the US stains China-US relations Although the TikTok ban was shortlived, it may have caused serious diplomatic wrangles between China and the US. Millions of Americans relied on the app for various initiatives, and the ban disrupted their routine. The app was already a symbol of culture to most users. Earlier, the platform released a brief statement from affected users, explaining that the Federal Reserve had passed a law banning its services in the US. The statement clarified that this was the reason America‚Äôs population could no longer access the platform. However, the users expressed optimism that the president-elect would collaborate with them to resolve the issue and reinstate TikTok. The statement also urged users to stay tuned for updates as had been removed from the Apple and Google app stores. Polymarket priced in a 95% chance of a TikTok ban going into effect TikTok ban and its developments found their way to Polymarket . The case of social media platforms was well represented on Polymarket. Would the app return? People were betting on it, and people were interested in the issue. The popular blockchain-based site Polymarket priced in a 95% chance of a TikTok ban going into effect in the U.S. by May, while its rival site Kalshi priced in 98% odds of a ban by May. The prediction platforms offer users the opportunity to wager on the outcomes of real-life events, purchasing contracts on either side of the outcome with odds moving accordingly based on the public money, similar to how a company‚Äôs share price changes as demand for buying and selling its stock moves. Many lost their bets when TikTok‚Äôs fate unexpectedly turned when they announced they would restore services. This outcome was a moment of relief and celebration for TikTok users, signaling the platform‚Äôs resilience amid challenges. It was a stark reminder for the betting platforms that even well-calculated odds can‚Äôt always account for the shifting tides of politics and diplomacy.

Its ICO was the talk of the crypto town, promising innovation, scalability, and a new way forward for blockchain technology. Those who got in early reaped the rewards as Cardano became one of the most prominent players in the crypto market. For the rest of us, though? It‚Äôs been a constant reminder of a golden opportunity missed. But here‚Äôs the thing about crypto: it‚Äôs full of second chances. Enter Qubetics, a project that‚Äôs redefining global finance with its innovative cross-border transaction solutions. With a presale that‚Äôs already making waves and the potential for explosive growth, Qubetics is positioning itself as one of the top cryptos to invest in January 2025 . If you missed out on Cardano, this is your chance to rewrite your crypto story. Cardano: The One That Set the Standard Cardano wasn‚Äôt just another blockchain project‚Äîit was a revolution. Launched in 2017, its focus on scalability, sustainability, and interoperability made it a standout in a crowded market. The project‚Äôs commitment to rigorous research and peer-reviewed development gave it an edge that few could match. During its ICO, Cardano‚Äôs ADA token was priced at just $0.02. Fast forward to today, and it‚Äôs become a staple in the portfolios of seasoned investors. Cardano‚Äôs rise wasn‚Äôt just about hype‚Äîit was a testament to the power of innovation and long-term vision. But for those of us who didn‚Äôt get in early, it‚Äôs been a tough pill to swallow. Watching Cardano‚Äôs success from the sidelines has been a constant reminder of what could have been. That‚Äôs why Qubetics feels like such a big deal‚Äîit‚Äôs the chance to get in early on something just as transformative.

Qubetics‚Äô presale has already raised over $9.9 million, with more than 425 million $TICS tokens sold . Analysts are predicting a post-launch price of $10-$15, which means early investors are staring at jaw-dropping ROI potential. This isn‚Äôt just a project with potential‚Äîit‚Äôs a project with momentum. And in the fast-paced world of crypto, that‚Äôs everything. Why Missing Qubetics Would Be Worse Than Missing Cardano We‚Äôve all felt the sting of a missed opportunity, but what if you could avoid it this time? Imagine scrolling through your news feed six months from now and seeing Qubetics dominating the headlines. The $TICS token is soaring, and early investors are cashing in on massive returns. Sound familiar? That‚Äôs exactly how Cardano played out for those who got in late‚Äîor not at all. But this time, you don‚Äôt have to be on the sidelines. Qubetics is still in its presale phase, which means the door is wide open. Don‚Äôt let this be another ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù moment. What Sets Qubetics Apart from the Crowd? While many blockchain projects focus on the here and now, Qubetics is building for the long term. Its cross-border transaction solution isn‚Äôt just innovative‚Äîit‚Äôs essential in a world that‚Äôs becoming increasingly interconnected. Qubetics isn‚Äôt just about hype‚Äîit‚Äôs about solving real problems. By making international payments faster, cheaper, and more transparent, it‚Äôs creating value for individuals, businesses, and financial institutions alike. What Happens If You Miss Qubetics? Let‚Äôs be real: missing Cardano hurt, but missing Qubetics could hurt even more. This isn‚Äôt just about financial returns‚Äîit‚Äôs about being part of a project that‚Äôs changing the game. The crypto world moves fast, and opportunities like this don‚Äôt come around often. If you‚Äôre looking for the top cryptos to invest in January 2025 , Qubetics isn‚Äôt just a good choice‚Äîit‚Äôs the choice. Conclusion: Your Second Chance Is Here Cardano taught us that timing is everything in crypto. Early investors saw life-changing returns, and the project became a benchmark for success. But if you missed the Cardano train, it‚Äôs time to stop looking back and start looking forward. Qubetics is here, and it‚Äôs offering a chance to be part of something truly transformative.

Related Reading: Bitcoin Reserve In The US: 65% Chance It Happens In 2025 Coinbase Reports Rise Of Altcoins Coinbase crypto exchange suggested that the upcoming massive market rally for altcoins could be on the way and might happen in the succeeding weeks after Trump returns to the White House. The crypto exchange released its latest weekly market commentary which provided its insights on Trump‚Äôs upcoming inauguration and its impact on the cryptocurrency landscape, saying that although the incoming American president is pro-crypto, it might take a while before ‚Äúall planned crypto-related policies on the agenda‚Äù will be fully implemented. However, Coinbase analysts noted that after Trump‚Äôs inauguration on January 20, they are expecting a surge in altcoins since, they believe, the digital asset space is preparing for a massive altcoin rally. The crypto exchange‚Äôs report stated that crypto traders might be strategically positioning themselves to fuel another growth spurt for altcoins under the Trump administration. According to Coinbase, the latest surge in altcoins is driven by a slight drop in the dominance of Bitcoin. ‚ÄúThe drop in BTC dominance from 58.5% to its support level of 57.3% during the inflation print relief rally on January 15 suggests to us that traders may be positioning for an outsized altcoin market rally on the back of positive catalysts for risk assets and crypto,‚Äù Coinbase explained in the report. BTC‚Äôs Fading Dominance A crypto analyst observed that the dominance of the world‚Äôs most popular cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, could be slightly dipping, a circumstance that allowed the latest altcoin pump. ‚ÄúImportantly for the long tail, $BTC dominance has been slowly fading since late November ‚Äô24 ‚Äì fireworks if that continues,‚Äù VC firm Placeholder partner and former ARK Invest crypto lead Chris Burniske said.

TRX, the network‚Äôs native currency, as well as WTRX, its wrapped version, experienced significant adoption due to decentralized finance (DeFi) activity. This was particularly seen on the Tron-based decentralized exchange (DEX), SunSwap, which sparked an influx of new tokens and increased transaction activity, which, in turn, aided in Tron‚Äôs diversification beyond stablecoin transactions. Tron‚Äôs Shift Beyond Stablecoin Transactions According to CryptoQuant‚Äôs latest analysis , the Tron network‚Äôs activity remains heavily influenced by USDT, which saw its supply increase from $48 billion to $62 billion in 2024. Over the same period, the value of USDT transfers surged from $362 billion to $576 billion. This was accompanied by a rise in monthly transfers from 55 million to 62 million. USDT continues to dominate as the most transferred asset and makes up 99% of token activity. Tron, however, reached a turning point in DeFi activity last year, with SunSwap leading the charge as the network‚Äôs most active decentralized exchange. By August, monthly transactions on SunSwap had climbed to 4 million, with 97% involving WTRX. From August through December, total swap transactions climbed to 8.3 million, reflecting a growth in DeFi engagement. Over 80% of these transactions involved WTRX, which saw its swap volume skyrocket from 4.2 billion to 20 billion units, or $4.1 billion, by year-end. The launch of meme coin generator SunPump further fueled network activity by simplifying meme coin creation, resulting in the introduction of 94,000 new tokens and a surge in transaction volumes. In another milestone, Tron also overtook Bitcoin as the most-used payment blockchain, ultimately securing 31.5% of all transactions. But, the developments failed to lift the price of TRX. TRX‚Äôs Short-Lived Recovery? TRX did see a resurgence last year, climbing back to the 10th spot in market capitalization as it instilled fresh confidence. The subsequent market corrections, however, pushed the asset‚Äôs price to $0.225, representing a nearly 50% decline from its recent all-time high of $0.43. Hopes for a local bottom also proved short-lived when TRX dropped below the $0.23 threshold.

Analyzing the recent price action, MEME‚Äôs price has fluctuated significantly over the past month, with notable resistance and support levels. The bearish trend has been consistent, but the increased trading volume could indicate the potential for a reversal. Despite the current market conditions, long-term projections remain bullish due to Memecoin‚Äôs fundamental potential and market positioning.

Immediate resistance lies at $0.010 and $0.011, while support is found at $0.0095 and $0.0088. Indicators suggest potential stabilization as bullish momentum emerges.

This recent price movement has improved sentiment in the market, with MEME ranking #186 on CoinMarketCap, boasting a market capitalization of $355,908,478. The circulating supply stands at 36,529,798,454 MEME, with a maximum supply of 69,000,000,000 MEME coins. MEME/USD daily chart analysis: Consolidation with upside potential The daily chart highlights MEME‚Äôs attempt to break above its recent consolidation range. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 44.26 indicates neutral momentum, with a slight upward bias. The MACD line crossing above the signal line shows that buying pressure is starting to emerge. MEME/USD daily chart analysis: Consolidation with upside potential Resistance levels at $0.010 and $0.011 are critical for MEME to regain bullish momentum, while support at $0.0095 and $0.0088 provides a foundation for stabilization. MEME/USD 4-Hour Chart Analysis: Gradual Recovery In the 4-hour timeframe, MEME demonstrates a gradual recovery. The Awesome Oscillator‚Äôs green bars suggest that momentum is building, albeit at a slow pace. MEME/USD 4-hour chart analysis: Gradual recovery The ADX indicates weak trend strength, underscoring the need for a breakout above $0.010 to solidify bullish sentiment. The SMA-9 at $0.0096 provides immediate dynamic support, aligning with the $0.0095 support level. On the 4-hour chart, MEME has shown signs of recovery after testing key support levels near $0.0090. The Awesome Oscillator (AO) indicates the formation of bullish momentum, as the histogram has turned green above the zero line. The Average Directional Index (ADX) at 22.69, however, suggests that the trend strength remains weak, leaving room for further confirmation of upward momentum. Immediate resistance lies at $0.010 and $0.011, while $0.0095 and $0.0088 serve as support zones. What to expect from Memecoin price analysis If MEME sustains its current momentum, it could target resistance at $0.010 and $0.011 in the short term. A breakout above $0.011 would pave the way for a potential rally toward $0.012. However, a failure to maintain support at $0.0095 could trigger a retest of $0.0088, risking further downside. Given Memecoin‚Äôs growing market capitalization and liquidity, long-term investors may view current levels as an accumulation opportunity.

The token trades at $0.0114, reflecting minor consolidation, with short-term resistance at $0.01157 and strong support at $0.01111. While the price has stabilized following a prior downtrend, broader technical indicators suggest market indecision. Despite this, Memecoin has displayed resilience, holding key support levels and gradually building momentum. Is Memecoin a good investment? Investing in MEME coins can be considered a strategic move for those looking to tap into the viral nature of meme-driven assets. These coins often see rapid appreciation or decrease in value driven by social media trends and community enthusiasm, which can lead to substantial short-term gains. The appeal of MEME coin lies in its potential to capitalize on the widespread attention and excitement surrounding viral tokens, making it an attractive option for investors adept at navigating the volatile crypto market and timing their trades to optimize returns. Will Memecoin recover? Based on the chart and the recent upward movement, Memecoin shows signs of recovery. If this positive trend continues, Memecoin has the potential for further recovery. Will Memecoin reach 10? Given its current price levels and market trends, Meme coin prediction is highly unlikely to reach $10 for Memecoin. Will Memecoin reach 100? Reaching $100 for Memecoin is extremely improbable due to its current price levels and the enormous market capitalization required. Such a drastic increase in prices would necessitate unprecedented growth and adoption. Does Memecoin have a good long-term future? Based on data and the recent upward movement, Memecoin may have the potential for a good long-term future. Positive market trends, adoption, and development will be crucial for its success.

Meanwhile, Memecoin is expected to reach a minimum price of $0.0100. The maximum price may reach $0.0245 in 2025. Memecoin historic price sentiment Memecoin was launched on 28th October by the renowned internet humor platform 9GAG and has quickly become a significant player in the meme coin market. The Memecoin garnered immense popularity through a unique launch strategy involving a fire sale and strategic social media airdrops to cultivate a robust and dedicated community. This approach proved highly successful. The fire sale raised over $11 million and sold more than 11.4 billion MEME tokens at $0.001 each, representing a 150% surge from what the team initially planned. Looking at its price history since 27th October 2020, MEME saw its first price pump on the same day, reaching a high of $0.02868. The MEME token price remained above $0.0020 until 7 November, when a minor pullback occurred below the $0.0200 level. By April 2021, the price skyrocketed, reaching an all-time high of over $0.05 as meme-driven tokens gained massive popularity due to social media hype and celebrity endorsements. However, following this rally, the price retraced sharply by June 2021, stabilizing around $0.02-$0.03. After a quiet 2022, Memecoin regained attention in 2023 due to renewed interest in memecoins and a crypto market recovery. A mid-year rally faced resistance, stabilizing at $0.015‚Äì$0.02, but by year-end, the price stagnated amid regulatory scrutiny and waning investor enthusiasm. In 2024, MEME saw price fluctuations: recovering to $0.026 in January with a crypto market surge, dropping to $0.012 by July amid weak sentiment, and rebounding to $0.017 in November with community-driven campaigns, ending the year trading between $0.01624 and $0.018.

Elon Manipulates Trump (ELTRUMP), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELTRUMP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon Manipulates Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Manipulates Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Manipulates Trump launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.

The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

Trump promised to free Ross Ulbricht during his campaign days Speaking at the Libertarian Party‚Äôs National Convention on May 25, 2024, Donald Trump promised to commute the sentence of Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht on his first day in office. He made the same promise at the 2024 Bitcoin Conference in July 2024. Bitcoin enthusiasts still believe that Trump will keep his word and release Ross within his first 100 days in office. Bets on Kalshi even put Ross at an 81% chance of a presidential pardon, while on Polymarket‚Äôs prediction market, Ross‚Äôs odds of a Trump pardon are at 79%. Not to mention, his wife has hinted that Ross is preparing to leave jail soon. She posted on his behalf on his X account, saying: For my last monthly resolution of 2024, I intend to study every day and to get up to speed as much as I can as I prepare for freedom. Ross Similarly, on November 12, 2024, Ross thanked Trump, saying he could finally see light after 11 years of darkness. Ulbricht wrote a letter to Biden asking for a presidential pardon In 2013, Ulbricht was arrested, with officials having to close his Silk Road and seize over 174000 Bitcoin. Ulbricht was then charged with operating a criminal enterprise, conspiracy to money laundering and computer hacking, and identity fraud. In May 2015, he received a life sentence despite pleading for leniency. Years later, Ross wrote to President Joe Biden asking for pardon. He claimed he started the Silk Road with good intentions and simply pushed for his libertarian beliefs. He also promised to remain law-abiding when released. However, President Biden never acted on the letter. Perhaps with Trump, Ross could have a better chance of earning freedom.

Cardano‚Äôs ADA price has climbed past $1 due to its ecosystem advancements and strategic initiatives. At the same time, TRON‚Äôs price has reached new highs, drawing investor interest with consistent gains. Among these shifts, Web3Bay (3BAY) stands out, transforming e-commerce with blockchain. Unlike others reliant on speculation, 3BAY offers real utility, adding real value for its users and early backers. Web3Bay‚Äôs 6430% ROI Potential Shouldn‚Äôt Be Ignored Web3Bay is rapidly gaining recognition in the cryptocurrency world for its innovative approach to decentralizing e-commerce. This blockchain-based platform provides a secure, transparent, and cost-effective marketplace for both buyers and sellers, eliminating the hefty fees typical of traditional platforms. Additionally, the 3BAY token not only facilitates transactions but also offers special advantages such as discounts and governance rights.

With an anticipated launch price of $0.1959, early investors are positioned for a potential 6,430% return. Furthermore, Web3Bay is at the forefront of pioneering developments like decentralized storage and cross-chain functionality, establishing itself as a leader in the Web3 e-commerce arena. For those looking for an investment with substantial growth potential and practical application, Web3Bay represents an exceptional opportunity that is too good to miss. ADA Price Climbs Past $1 with Growing Ecosystem Cardano‚Äôs ADA recently surpassed the $1 threshold, part of a wider market recovery, with digital currencies gaining momentum as Bitcoin nears the $100,000 mark. Analysts see ADA potentially rising toward $2 amid a bullish pattern of development. Cardano is seeing major ecosystem developments, with founder Charles Hoskinson joining a new crypto policy team, signaling a significant step for Cardano and wider blockchain usage. The Midnight project further expands Cardano‚Äôs privacy and interoperability, tackling real-world integration and regulatory challenges. TRON Price Reaches New Peak TRON (TRX) has seen significant price changes recently, drawing the interest of both investors and market analysts. On January 17, 2025, TRX was trading at around $0.2444, marking a 2.82% rise from its last close. This increase is part of a wider positive movement within the cryptocurrency market. Ongoing development efforts and strategic alliances are believed to bolster TRON‚Äôs durability and future expansion prospects. Nonetheless, experts warn that the market is still prone to swift shifts, and they recommend that investors keep up-to-date with TRON-specific updates and broader market trends. In summary, the rise in TRON‚Äôs price to $0.2444 highlights its active presence in the cryptocurrency sector. Although the current trend seems favorable, those participating in the market should engage in detailed research and proceed with caution in their investment choices. Final Say! The rise in ADA‚Äôs price bolsters its appeal for the long term, though its future remains uncertain. TRON‚Äôs recent price surge demonstrates its tenacity, albeit without notable distinctiveness. In contrast, Web3Bay stands out with its practical use in e-commerce and its impressive potential for a 6,430% ROI for early investors, setting it apart from others. By integrating blockchain technology with global retail, Web3Bay is not only introducing innovation but also delivering real value where it‚Äôs most needed.

Chosun Ilbo reported that a 42-year-old individual surnamed Lee was found guilty of violating the National Security Act. Lee was also suspended from working in similar roles for a further four years.

Musk AI Boost (MUSKAIBO), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKAIBO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk AI Boost can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk AI Boost could become the next viral memecoin. Musk AI Boost launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk AI Boost on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk AI Boost by entering its contract address ‚Äì 72pTcxNcaiTgNRSbCHaAPS97WFRdWwpfqbQdqEi7JP8J ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKAIBO.

Is this a good idea?,https://crypto.news/over-50-americans-sell-gold-or-stocks-to-buy-bitcoin/,"Most people who read about cryptocurrencies know that Bitcoin, due to its characteristics, is often referred to as ‚Äòdigital gold.‚Äô A new study reveals that more and more people in the U.S. prefer Bitcoin to gold. The GameFi platform ChainPlay conducted a joint survey with Storible. In their study, they asked 1,428 Americans about cryptocurrencies and investments in their lives. According to the report , over 68% of Americans now own some crypto. 77% consider increasing their crypto investment in 2025. 60% of crypto investors believe the value of their assets will double in 2025. The survey shows that 50% of crypto owners are boomers, while nearly 30% are millennials, and the rest are Gen Z. The report authors conclude that crypto owners get younger. However, it is not clear what digits were used as a reference point. The total lack of Gen X representatives in this report raises questions. Now that‚Äôs the real lost generation! Unfortunately, the report doesn‚Äôt specify what the groups of respondents were and how ChainPlay and Storible chose who to survey. According to other sources, only 13% of Americans owned crypto as of November 2024. It seems that the number heavily depends on the methodology. New crypto investment stats A survey revealed that Trump‚Äôs victory made a serious impact on people‚Äôs perception of cryptocurrencies, with 38% of respondents deciding to invest in crypto following the election outcome. A huge amount of these people, 84%, are first-time buyers who decided to try fortunes in crypto after the win of the pro-crypto candidate. Now, it‚Äôs time to talk more closely about the BTC investment insights found in the report. There are three main points. First, 51% of Americans allocate over 30% of their assets in meme coins. That‚Äôs an interesting statistic proving that a booming meme token market is no joke. The second point notes that one-fifth of Americans allocate over 30% of their investment in crypto. And, finally, third‚Äìnearly 52% of responders admitted they were selling gold or stocks to invest in Bitcoin. The latter revelation illustrates the tectonic shift in people‚Äôs minds. Over half of all respondents believe now that Bitcoin is here to stay, and it is safer and probably more profitable than gold or stocks. The preference for Bitcoin over gold or stocks was still a marginal mindset during the 2017 bull run. Nowadays, when various governments across the globe announce they will mine or stock bitcoins or use it for international payments, people look at Bitcoin without prejudice. On top of that, the stats mean that these people not only decided to buy some BTC, but they have made an additional step of dumping their traditional assets to invest in BTC first. According to the survey, over 51% of such people are in America. It shows the unprecedented bullishness of digital gold.

Both assets are scarce and deflationary. There will not be more gold or more Bitcoin in the future. The amount of both assets is finite and isn‚Äôt likely to increase. You have probably heard about the preset Bitcoin mining reward shrinks in two once every four years (so-called halving). The gold mining is decreasing too, however, the speed at which the gold mining drops is far behind Bitcoin‚Äôs increasing scarcity. Experts speculate whether humanity reached the ‚Äúgold peak‚Äù point (a moment after which gold mining will be constantly dropping). In the Bitcoin case, the Bitcoin peak was in the first years, and then, production has always gone down, making Bitcoin scarcer than gold. When gold mining drops by a couple of percent, Bitcoin may drop by 50%. More than that, after every coin is mined, Bitcoin may be going to the moon, and the gold diggers may literally start mining gold on the moon, increasing the total supply available for the Earth‚Äôs markets. While gold gets increasingly scarce due to its use in devices, jewelry, and other products, bitcoins get lost or blocked forever. The speed at which bitcoins get stuck has been so high that in 16 years of Bitcoin‚Äôs existence, around 20% of all units are considered lost. ‚ö°Ô∏èMARK CUBAN: ‚Äú #Bitcoin ‚Äì it became a store of value, it‚Äôs marketed that way and has been marketed for the last 15 years or whatever it is and it‚Äôs gotten to a point of acceptance just like gold.‚Äù pic.twitter.com/w3h2fjEnps ‚Äî Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) January 4, 2025 According to businessman and TV personality Mark Cuban, Bitcoin became a store of value and reached an acceptance level comparable to gold. Both he and MicroStrategy‚Äôs frontman Michael Saylor point out that in contrast to gold, Bitcoin is easy to transport and generally control. Read more: Mark Cuban chooses Bitcoin over Gold as economic hedge Saylor once offered a thought experiment in which we should imagine trying to bring a substantial amount of gold or cash to the plane. The airport officers will treat owners as thieves. The same happens if we try to send a large amount of money abroad via a wire transfer. Saylor notes that, unlike traditional assets, Bitcoin provides owners with autonomy and control over their funds. Michael Saylor on Gold vs Fiat vs #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/9UNtVe0M8x ‚Äî Vivek‚ö°Ô∏è (@Vivek4real_) January 16, 2025 In another instance, Saylor noted that the gold era ended in the 16th century when other means of payment became more popular. However, Cuban‚Äôs estimation, in which he rather puts Bitcoin in line with gold, seems to be less maximalist as people still invest in gold while it‚Äôs obvious that it is Bitcoin, not gold, that is going through the blooming phase. The possible downside of Bitcoin is its higher volatility and shorter market history. However, as of 2025, its ups have always been more prominent than downs.

Stellar has seen a steady climb thanks to its appeal in international transactions, while Dogecoin‚Äôs price is on an upward trajectory, supported by major buying from big holders. Stellar is on the verge of hitting $0.50, generating enthusiasm from big-money players, and Dogecoin might soon reach $3, exciting market watchers. Amid these developments, Web3Bay (3BAY) is introducing a significant shift‚Äîa practical approach to solving real issues in international e-commerce. By merging blockchain with decentralized control, Web3Bay is setting up a marketplace that lowers costs, boosts clarity, and gives power to its users. With over $830,000 collected and a projected 6,430% ROI for early buyers, Web3Bay is not just following trends; it‚Äôs shaping the future of commerce. Web3Bay‚Äôs Blueprint for Tomorrow‚Äôs Global Trading Web3Bay is more than a marketplace; it‚Äôs a blueprint for the future of trading. While old platforms often put earnings before user experience, Web3Bay is rewriting this story. It combines decentralized storage, works across multiple blockchains, and uses Layer-2 scaling to create lasting infrastructure. Its hybrid payment approach, accepting cryptocurrencies and mainstream options like PayPal and Apple Pay, makes it accessible worldwide. Priced at just $0.0045626 in its fourth presale phase, the 3BAY token has already secured over $830,000. With each phase, the token‚Äôs price goes up, leading to a launch price of $0.1959‚Äîa potential return of over 6,430% for early buyers. The roadmap is exciting, too, with plans for an NFT marketplace and staking for 3BAY holders, offering more ways to engage with the ecosystem. As the presale picks up pace, Web3Bay is proving it‚Äôs more than just a concept; it‚Äôs a real answer to the shortcomings of traditional e-commerce. Early backers are not just investors but pioneers of a movement focusing on clarity, safety, and user empowerment. The Web3Bay revolution is here, making now the ideal time to get involved. Stellar Price Rises Amid Market Optimism As of January 16, 2025, Stellar‚Äôs price stands at $0.482793, up by 1.08% from its last close. The cryptocurrency saw a daily high of $0.514258 and a low of $0.4715, showing significant price swings. The recent price increase fits with overall positive market sentiment, as players look forward to favorable regulation and more interest from big investors. Stellar‚Äôs efficient handling of international payments keeps drawing financial and tech interest. Experts think Stellar might soon test the $0.50 resistance if the momentum holds. However, they remind potential buyers that the market‚Äôs unpredictable nature demands thorough research before any purchase decisions. Can Dogecoin Price Reach $3 Soon? Recently, Dogecoin‚Äôs price has seen notable movements. As of January 17, 2025, DOGE trades at about $0.4061, marking a 7.78% rise from its previous close. It touched a high and low of $0.4061 and $0.3688 on the same day. This uptrend coincides with overall market movements, including Bitcoin‚Äôs recent jump past $107,000. Significant buying by large holders, acquiring 200 million DOGE in just 48 hours, shows strong bullish sentiment. Analysts suggest that if Dogecoin continues this momentum and breaks past the $0.40 mark, it could aim for a $3 value. Still, the known volatility of the crypto market warrants caution from investors. Final Remarks! While Stellar‚Äôs durability and Dogecoin‚Äôs significant buys underscore the market‚Äôs speculative nature, neither offers the comprehensive utility that Web3Bay delivers. The 3BAY token is the core of a decentralized marketplace aimed at revolutionizing traditional e-commerce . Currently priced at $0.0045626 in its fourth presale phase, 3BAY presents unmatched growth potential, with a projected launch price of $0.1959. As Web3Bay continues to grow, early supporters gain both financial benefits and a stake in a game-changing ecosystem. For those seeking a high-growth opportunity with a real impact, Web3Bay emerges as the premier choice.

Particularly, data from blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock shows that Ethereum whales now hold about 43% of the total circulating supply of ETH. The imbalance in ETH holdings raises important questions about its implications for Ethereum‚Äôs price and market dynamics moving forward. Whale Accumulation Surges By Over 90% Since Early 2023 According to IntoTheBlock, the total concentration of ETH in whale addresses is currently at 61.09 ETH, which represents about 43% of the total supply. This marks a significant shift from early 2023, when whales held just 22% of Ethereum‚Äôs circulating supply. IntoTheBlock classifies whale addresses as those holding more than 1% of the total circulating supply of ETH. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bulls Eye $3 As Whales Scoop 200 Million DOGE In The Last 2 Days The nearly twofold increase in Ethereum whale holdings within just a year is a noteworthy development. Naturally, such a concentration of a large supply of cryptocurrency into a few wallets would spell doom for the asset, as it would mean a few players would be able to manipulate price dynamics as they wish. However, Ethereum‚Äôs case deviates from this narrative due to the unique nature of its ecosystem and recent structural shifts within the network since 2022. The sharp rise in whale concentration can be attributed to two major factors: the Ethereum merge and the growing appeal of ETH staking to earn rewards. The Ethereum merge, which took place in 2022, transitioned the blockchain from a proof-of-work (PoW) system to a proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism. As such, in-depth data from IntoTheBlock, which shows the 61.09 million ETH concentrated in only three whale addresses, makes much sense. What this means is that these ETH are mostly those locked in the proof-of-stake staking algorithm used by block validators on the Ethereum network. By locking up their Ethereum, ETH miners and large holders have not only reduced the circulating supply but also contribute to price appreciation by reducing the amount of Ethereum available for trading. Ethereum Holder Dynamics ‚Äì Investors And Retailers The increase in ETH among whale addresses has meant less ETH is available for investors and retail owners. IntoTheBlock classifies investors as addresses holding between 0.1% and 1% of the total circulating supply, while retail are those with less than 0.1% of the total circulating supply. At the time of writing, there are 42 investor addresses and they collectively own 15.2 million ETH, which translates to 10.77% of the total circulating supply. Keeping in mind that the three whale addresses do not do much with price dynamics, investor addresses holding significant but more liquid portions of ETH have a greater capacity to affect market movements. Any substantial selloff from these investor addresses could trigger a sharp decline in Ethereum‚Äôs price.

At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $3,225 and is down by 2% in the past 24 hours.

Its chairman Michael Saylor has teased another Bitcoin purchase is on the horizon. With Bitcoin‚Äôs value soaring, currently sitting at around $101,490, the company‚Äôs holdings are now worth an impressive $47.3 billion. Its calculated investment strategy is paying off, with a 69% return, thanks to its relentless accumulation of Bitcoin over time. MicroStrategy‚Äôs ongoing focus on Bitcoin comes as both big institutions and individual investors show increasing interest in the digital asset. MicroStrategy Massive Bitcoin Hoard Michael Saylor has been very open about the company‚Äôs Bitcoin plans. Every week, for 11 weeks in a row, he posted hints about the company‚Äôs Bitcoin purchases. On January 19, he shared a Bitcoin chart, signaling that the firm is planning to buy more soon. Just a few days earlier, the company bought 2,530 BTC worth $243 million that pushed its Bitcoin stash to 450,000 BTC valued at a whopping $47.3 billion. The company‚Äôs plan is part of its 21/21 initiative, a bold move to raise $42 billion through equity and fixed-income securities to fund Bitcoin purchases. Recently, the company announced the plans to raise another $2 billion through a perpetual preferred stock offering to fuel its Bitcoin buying spree. This strategy underscores a long-term vision where Bitcoin is not just an asset but the foundation of MicroStrategy‚Äôs financial future. Saylor‚Äôs Push for a U.S. Bitcoin Reserve Michael Saylor, who has signaled his willingness to join America‚Äôs new political era, is not alone in his vision for Bitcoin. He has repeatedly suggested that the U.S. should consider adopting Bitcoin as a Strategic Reserve Asset (SRA). In a framework he presented in December 2024, Saylor argued that converting the U.S. Treasury‚Äôs gold holdings into Bitcoin would fortify the U.S dollar and neutralize the national debt. His plan even included an ambitious goal to create an $81 trillion Bitcoin strategic reserve. According to Saylor‚Äôs framework, such a move could propel Bitcoin markets to a $10 trillion market capitalization. Also, the overall digital asset capital markets could expand to $280 trillion. Above all, it would position the country as the dominant global force in the digital economy. A Call for Bitcoin Reserves The MicroStrategy Chairman‚Äôs ideas are not going unnoticed. Industry leaders, including Coinbase CEO Brain Armstrong and asset manager Anthony Pompliano, have joined the conversation. In a recent statement, Pompliano urged the U.S. government to acquire as much Bitcoin as possible, emphasizing the situation‚Äôs urgency. He warned that if the U.S. does not act quickly, it could be outpaced by other nations in the race to secure Bitcoin as a reserve asset. With countries like China already taking bold steps to integrate Bitcoin into their economies , the pressure is on the U.S. to act or risk falling behind.

They incentivize word-of-mouth marketing by rewarding users for inviting others into the fold. Not only does this build trust, but it also fuels organic growth. Crypto thrives on community, and referral programs ensure that growth is a collective effort. It‚Äôs a win-win‚Äîusers earn rewards, and projects get exposure to new audiences. Meme coins, in particular, have embraced referral programs as a way to amplify their reach. From Dogecoin‚Äôs viral beginnings to Shiba Inu‚Äôs expansive ecosystem, the biggest players know the value of community-driven promotion. Now, a new wave of meme coins is upping the ante. BTFD Coin (BTFD) stands out as a project poised to redefine the game with its robust referral program, Play-to-Earn (P2E) games, and high-yield staking rewards. Alongside Neiro and Non-Playable Coin (NPC), BTFD represents the best new meme coins to buy for 2025 . With its explosive presale performance and promising features, BTFD is primed to lead the next generation of meme coins. Meanwhile, Neiro and NPC each bring their unique flavor to the mix, offering investors multiple avenues for growth and engagement. Let‚Äôs dive deeper into what makes these projects special. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin Revolution BTFD Coin isn‚Äôt just another meme coin‚Äîit‚Äôs an ecosystem built for growth, engagement, and massive ROI. With its presale already raising ove r $5.2 million and selling more than 64 billion coins to 8,600 holders, BTFD has captured the attention of analysts and investors alike. At its current Stage 13 price of $0.000142, the opportunity to get in early is quickly slippin g away. One of BTFD‚Äôs standout features is its referral program . It‚Äôs simple: users share a unique link, and every successful referral earns them rewards. It‚Äôs not just a marketing tool; it‚Äôs a way to grow the community organically while putting more tokens in the hands of dedicated supporters. The program has been instrumental in driving BTFD‚Äôs presale success, creating a snowball effect of interest and investment. But there‚Äôs more to BTFD than referrals. Its P2E game offers a fun and interactive way for users to earn tokens while staying engaged with the ecosystem. Players can complete challenges, unlock rewards, and grow their portfolios‚Äîall while enjoying an immersive gaming experience. Combined with staking rewards boasting an eye-popping 90% APY, BTFD ensures that every holder has multiple ways to profit. Let‚Äôs talk numbers. An investment of $ 35,000 at the current Stage 13 price would secure 246,478,873 BTFD coins. Once the presale ends and the coin is listed at $0.0006, that investment could grow to an impressive $147,887. Stage 13 is already over 96% complete, so this price won‚Äôt stick around much longer. What‚Äôs more, this coin is poised to hit $0.006 post launch, taking the ROI to a whopping 4000%. Joining the presale is easy. Just visit BTFD‚Äôs Presale Page , connect your wallet, input your details, and confirm the transaction. With its innovative features and explosive potential, BTFD Coin is a no-brainer for investors seeking long-term gains. Neiro (NEIRO): AI Meets Meme Culture Neiro is carving out its own space in the meme coin world by merging artificial intelligence (AI) with community-driven innovation. Its branding is bold, its utility is forward-thinking, and its potential has analysts buzzing. Unlike traditional meme coins that rely solely on humor and community, Neiro integrates AI tools designed to enhance user experience and engagement. One of Neiro‚Äôs standout features is its AI-powered trading assistant, which provides real-time market insights and predictive analytics to help users make informed decisions. This isn‚Äôt just a gimmick; it‚Äôs a game-changing feature that adds real utility to the project. Neiro‚Äôs ecosystem also includes NFT integrations and plans for a decentralized application (dApp) that leverages AI for gamified interactions. Crypto analysts are optimistic about Neiro‚Äôs trajectory, citing its innovative use of AI as a major differentiator. However, while Neiro‚Äôs tech-forward approach is impressive, it lacks the robust financial incentives like high-yield staking or referral rewards that make BTFD so compelling. Still, for investors who value utility and innovation, Neiro is a strong contender. Non-Playable Coin (NPC): Humor and Community at Its Core Non-Playable Coin (NPC) embraces its meme roots wholeheartedly, offering a lighthearted approach to crypto investing. Its branding pokes fun at internet culture while fostering a tight-knit community of holders who share a love for all things quirky. NPC‚Äôs charm lies in its simplicity. The project doesn‚Äôt try to overcomplicate things‚Äîit‚Äôs about humor, engagement, and building a loyal following. Its ecosystem includes meme contests, community events, and plans for exclusive NFT drops that celebrate the NPC theme. The project thrives on social media buzz, with users actively sharing memes and promoting the coin organically. While NPC has carved out a niche for itself, it doesn‚Äôt offer the same depth of features as BTFD or the innovation of Neiro. Its growth is heavily reliant on community engagement, making it a riskier bet for investors seeking long-term returns. That said, NPC‚Äôs loyal fanbase ensures a steady level of interest, making it a fun option for those who value community-driven projects. Why BTFD Coin is the Smartest Investment Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin stands head and shoulders above its competitors as the best new meme coin to buy for 2025 . Its referral program, high-yield staking, and engaging P2E game make it a comprehensive option for both casual and serious investors. While Neiro impresses with its AI-driven approach and NPC captures the humor of meme culture, neither offers the same level of financial incentives or growth potential as BTFD. Join the BTFD Coin presale now and secure your spot in what could be one of the most profitable crypto projects of the year. With every passing stage, the price inches closer to its $0.0006 listing value. Don‚Äôt miss your chance to turn today‚Äôs investment into tomorrow‚Äôs success. Make the most of this wealth-generation opportunity with BTFD Coin.

Recent insights from TradingView analyst Real CryptoRoy, highlight that the token has likely found a local bottom, suggesting favorable conditions for upward momentum. Recovery Signs Appear as Shiba Inu (SHIB) Stabilizes In December 2024, the token reached a high of $0.00003330, marking its strongest price point in eight months. However, this peak was followed by a corrective phase, during which the token‚Äôs value declined by approximately 44% to $0.0000186. Since then, SHIB has shown signs of stabilization, bouncing back to the $0.00002 range and holding within a tight trading band over several weeks. In early January 2025, the token briefly climbed to $0.000024 before falling below $0.00002. While these fluctuations posed challenges for investors who entered the market near the December highs, they presented potential opportunities for medium-term investors seeking to benefit from a recovery phase. According to CryptoRoy, January 13 marked a significant turning point when Bitcoin dropped to a yearly low of $89,000. Despite Bitcoin‚Äôs dip, Shiba Inu demonstrated resilience by avoiding a new low, closing above $0.000021 after briefly touching $0.00001978. The analyst viewed this ability to maintain a ‚Äúhigher low‚Äù as an indication of growing bullish momentum for the token. Key Resistance Levels and Potential Price Targets The analyst emphasizes that the digital asset‚Äôs ability to hold above critical support levels suggests the correction phase may be nearing its conclusion. He identifies $0.000025 as a key resistance level the token must surpass to sustain a bullish breakout. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 If this successfully happens, especially with strong trading volume, it could pave the way for a retest of its December high of $0.000033. Furthermore, a decisive breakout could trigger additional rallies, potentially pushing the token to new all-time highs. However, CryptoRoy underscores that broader market trends, particularly Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements, will help determine SHIB‚Äôs trajectory. The performance of Bitcoin has a direct impact on altcoins like Shiba Inu. Broader Market Sentiment Boosts Prospects The overall sentiment in the cryptocurrency market has improved recently, driven by Bitcoin‚Äôs recovery to the $100,000 mark for the second time this year. This renewed optimism benefits Shiba Inu , which reached a weekly high of $0.00002282 following Bitcoin‚Äôs rally. As the market outlook becomes increasingly positive, analysts remain watchful of the asset‚Äôs performance, particularly its ability to break above critical resistance levels. Investors are advised to monitor Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance (BTC.D) and overall market trends to understand better the factors influencing Shiba Inu‚Äôs recovery potential. The token is on the brink of a significant price movement, supported by recent stabilization and technical indicators pointing toward bullish momentum. While key resistance levels and broader market dynamics will determine the extent of its recovery, the token‚Äôs resilience during market fluctuations highlights its potential for a strong rebound.

Trump the Solana King (TRUMPKIN), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPKIN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Trump the Solana King can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump the Solana King could become the next viral memecoin. Trump the Solana King launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump the Solana King on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump the Solana King by entering its contract address ‚Äì 6oubDpkm3XF2x3r5vPZAhw2TABZgNrjmgwEqxUxLAYa ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPKIN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SOL|SHIB|BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-20 00:50:00

Crypto strategist Ali Martinez tells his 115,00 followers on the social media platform X that the native asset of the decentralized oracle Chainlink appears to have broken out of a bull flag on the four-hour chart.

XRP is thriving due to positive economic shifts and legal victories, demonstrating its durability, while Algorand‚Äôs 20% increase underlines its robust market indicators and positive market reception. Amid these notable trends, Web3Bay‚Äôs 3BAY token stands out as a superior choice for both investors and pioneers. Unlike XRP and ALGO, which are primarily driven by market speculation and technical trends, Web3Bay offers tangible benefits by transforming e-commerce through blockchain technology. For those pursuing more than fleeting profits, Web3Bay presents a unique blend of practical utility and significant growth potential. Web3Bay Presale: A Unique Chance for Forward-Thinking Investors Web3Bay is revolutionizing e-commerce by building a secure and inclusive marketplace utilizing Web3 technology. Through blockchain, it resolves traditional system flaws, enabling a direct, decentralized, and efficient connection between buyers and sellers. The 3BAY token presale represents an unparalleled opportunity for investors eager to participate from the start of this innovative project. To date, Web3Bay has successfully raised over $830,000 and distributed 220 million tokens, indicating increasing trust in its future prospects. Priced currently at only $0.0045626, the token is exceptionally valuable, especially considering its anticipated launch price of $0.1959. With only a few million tokens left in stage 4, this presents a rare chance for significant returns. Beyond financial benefits, the 3BAY token serves a vital role, underpinning Web3Bay‚Äôs decentralized marketplace. As Web3Bay continues to expand and its adoption grows, the demand for 3BAY is expected to surge. Capitalizing on this opportunity now could secure the token at an optimal price before it garners broader market attention. XRP Price Achieves Seven-Year Peak Amid Favorable Market Trends XRP price has soared, hitting a seven-year pinnacle at $3.36‚Äîa 16% increase in just 24 hours. This significant rise is fueled by various factors, including a dip in U.S. core inflation, which boosts the likelihood of Federal Reserve rate cuts, typically favoring cryptocurrencies. The prospect of new spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that would directly own cryptocurrencies also enhances market optimism. Additionally, recent positive outcomes in the SEC‚Äôs lawsuit against Ripple have bolstered investor confidence. Analysts predict that the XRP price might climb to $4.40 following a Fibonacci extension pattern, although some long-standing investors might start to take profits following these sharp increases. Algorand (ALGO) Witnesses a 20% Increase, Market Valuation Reaches $4 Billion ALGO has witnessed a 20% surge in the last 24 hours, pushing its market cap back up to $4 billion. In the past week alone, ALGO has appreciated by 38%, showing robust bullish momentum. Important metrics like the Directional Movement Index (DMI) and the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicate strengthening trends and buyer dominance, which boosts confidence in the ongoing positive trend. With a recent golden cross in its Exponential Moving Averages (EMA), ALGO is poised to challenge significant resistance levels, potentially leading to further gains if the bullish momentum continues. Summing Up While XRP leverages favorable legal and economic conditions and ALGO rides on technical momentum, both rely largely on market speculation. In contrast, Web3Bay introduces real value by tackling global e-commerce challenges through its decentralized marketplace and the 3BAY token. With its successful presale, innovative payment solutions, and commitment to reducing fees and enhancing transparency, Web3Bay transcends typical crypto offerings, representing a pivotal shift in blockchain-based commerce . For those seeking innovations with substantial applications, Web3Bay presents a compelling option.

Crypto market observer Crypto Rand has labeled the token‚Äôs price chart as one of the most promising in the current bull market, citing its solid price structure as a foundation for further gains. Bullish Pennant Formation Suggests Upward Potential Crypto Rand shared his observations on Cardano‚Äôs chart, pointing to a strong rally in late 2024. This upward movement created a clear flagpole, which has since been followed by a consolidation phase represented by a symmetrical triangle pattern. This pattern, known as a bullish pennant, is widely regarded as a signal of continuation in technical analysis. It reflects the gradual dominance of buying pressure over selling activity, suggesting that ADA could resume its upward trend if the pattern resolves positively. $ADA continues consolidating the bull pennant, one of the best looking charts out there pic.twitter.com/iDGRzCKL7q ‚Äî Crypto Rand (@crypto_rand) January 16, 2025 In recent price action, Cardano rose 6.8%, climbing from $1.03 to $1.10. Currently , the token is approaching a key resistance level near $1.20. A breakout beyond this threshold could lead to much higher price targets, with Crypto Rand‚Äôs analysis hinting at the possibility of ADA reaching or surpassing $2 in the near term. Analysts Support Bullish Outlook for Cardano (ADA) Crypto Rand is not the only analyst optimistic about Cardano‚Äôs price potential. Market analyst Aboozar has highlighted another bullish structure on ADA‚Äôs chart, sharing his findings in a recent update. Aboozar pointed to a cup-and-handle pattern, often a precursor to significant upward movements. His analysis shows that the asset has spent several months in a period of accumulation, completing a rounded base during this time. The token is now consolidating within a narrow range above a key support zone between $0.80 and $1.00. Aboozar predicts a breakout to much higher levels, with a possible target near $3 if this pattern plays out. This projection aligns with the belief that the asset could reclaim its 2021 all-time high.

In his commentary, Sherpa highlighted that Cardano was one of the few altcoins to approach its previous highs from the 2017‚Äì2018 market cycle during the 2021 rally. Sherpa believes the token‚Äôs strong chart structure and market history position it well for continued growth, provided the broader cryptocurrency market maintains its positive momentum. The recent price action and technical patterns suggest that the token is well-positioned for further gains. Key bullish indicators, including the pennant and cup-and-handle formations, point to the potential for significant breakouts. While market conditions will play a critical role in ADA‚Äôs performance, the widespread optimism among analysts reflects the strong prospects for the token in the weeks ahead.

He took to the social media platform X to criticize these projections as overly optimistic and detached from market realities. Soni specifically targeted claims suggesting XRP could reach $100 or even $1,000 during the current market cycle. He dismissed these predictions as implausible and questioned the judgment of those making such claims. According to him, these forecasts indicate a lack of understanding of market fundamentals. Market Capitalization Analysis Highlights Unfeasibility The analyst supported his critique with an analysis of market capitalization. He argued that the token reaching $100 per coin would require a total market cap of approximately $10 trillion, a figure he deems far beyond what the current cryptocurrency market can realistically support. Additionally, he noted that an XRP price of $1,000 would push its market cap to an unprecedented $100 trillion, a valuation he described as entirely unrealistic. Highlighting the need for practicality in investment strategies, Soni advised against focusing on such exaggerated projections. Instead, he recommended established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which he views as a more reliable and proven investment option. He further described the asset as a distraction in the broader cryptocurrency space. Recent Price Movements and Community Sentiment Soni‚Äôs remarks come as the token gains traction, recently surpassing its all-time high. The cryptocurrency has been experiencing an upward trend, with its price climbing to $3.29 and a market capitalization of $189 billion at the time of reporting. This price movement has prompted some XRP supporters to adopt even more optimistic outlooks, with certain analysts revising their predictions upward. Despite the momentum, many within the community remain divided on the feasibility of reaching such high valuations. Some analysts have warned against inflated expectations, emphasizing that while the token‚Äôs historical performance has been strong, projections of $100 or more per coin lack solid evidence or realistic timelines. Diverging Opinions Among Analysts While some financial commentators, such as Linda Jones , believe XRP could reach $100 in the future, they have refrained from specifying a timeline. Other proponents, like analyst Javon Mark, have suggested even higher valuations, arguing that the asset‚Äôs technical indicators support the possibility of a significant price surge in this cycle. However, more conservative voices within the XRP community have cautioned against over-optimism. They argue that while the asset has demonstrated strong growth, its ability to achieve such high prices remains speculative. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Responses from the Community Soni‚Äôs criticism has sparked debate among supporters. Many have countered his claims by pointing out the speculative nature of Bitcoin maximalists‚Äô predictions, which often involve the eventual repricing of all global assets in Bitcoin. When pressed for further insights, Soni reiterated his negative stance on the token, describing it as a worthless asset with no long-term viability. He also predicted that XRP‚Äôs value could eventually collapse entirely. Despite these remarks, many in the community view Soni‚Äôs comments as biased, citing the token‚Äôs recent performance, which has outpaced Bitcoin‚Äôs in certain metrics. The ongoing discourse underscores the polarized perspectives surrounding the asset‚Äôs potential and place in the cryptocurrency market.

Elon Manipulates Trump (ELTRUMP), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELTRUMP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon Manipulates Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Manipulates Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Manipulates Trump launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Manipulates Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Manipulates Trump by entering its contract address ‚Äì HbYCEX5o56wcb5u6M8T3fkiaeFYgvQtxqBwt9yDoBoAV ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELTRUMP. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|DOGE|SOL|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-20 02:03:00

The leading cryptocurrency by market value briefly dipped below $100,000, representing a 4.5% drop on a 24-hour basis. ETH, XRP, SOL and BNB posted bigger losses, with ADA and DOGE losing over 10%, according to data sources CoinDesk and Coingecko. TRUMP, the memecoin linked to President-elect Donald Trump, which debuted Saturday, tanked 30% to $49, as Trump's wife, Melania launched her own memecoin, MELANIA. ""The Official Melania Meme is live! You can buy $MELANIA now,‚Äù Melania Trump posted on the social platform X on Sunday. The meme coin's website describes the token as a fungible cryptocurrency created and tracked on the Solana blockchain. The MELANIA token rallied a staggering 24,000% to a record price of $13, supposedly sucking out liquidity from the TRUMP coin, which was the most-traded digital asset on Binance over the weekend. Per some observers , the frenzied trading in TRUMP and MELANIA coins represents the FOMO phase of the bull market and could lead to a notable BTC price correction. Meanwhile, others like Arca's CIO Jeff Dorman believe the debut of TRUMP is a green light to all possibilities. ""To start, the pushback for 3+ years from both potential token issuers and potential investors in the U.S. has been ‚Äúregulatory concerns‚Äù.

""TRUMP token just signaled to every company, municipality, university & individual brand that crypto can now be used as a capital formation and customer bootstrapping mechanism.,"" Dorman continued.

Following a period of price accumulation, the meme coin has shown signs of bullish momentum, with analysts speculating a ‚Äúbig pump‚Äù is imminent. This forecast comes after the asset quickly recovered from a downtrend earlier this week, gaining more than 9% in value following a 3.17% drop the previous day. Despite this recent recovery, the token‚Äôs performance still lags behind some major market assets. In the past week, SHIB has risen by just 8%, while other notable cryptocurrencies, such as XRP and Dogecoin, have appreciated by 43% and 18%, respectively. Nevertheless, technical indicators suggest a substantial increase in Shiba Inu (SHIB) price could occur soon, according to several analysts. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Technical Analysis A key contributor to the optimistic outlook for SHIB is the recent identification of a price compression pattern on the cryptocurrency‚Äôs monthly chart. Analyst SimpleTrader2018 from TradingView has pointed out that Shiba Inu has been moving within a symmetrical triangle formation for the past six months. This pattern began at SHIB‚Äôs low in August 2024, at $0.00001083, with the price climbing to $0.00003341 by December. The breakout from this symmetrical structure is crucial to the next phase of the asset‚Äôs price action. According to SimpleTrader2018, the meme coin is expected to surge if it can regain bullish momentum. The analyst predicts that a breakout could lead to a significant price increase within one to two monthly candlesticks, signaling a potential breakout in the short term. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Several analysts have supported the prediction of a major surge for Shiba Inu, with some estimating a tenfold price increase soon. CryptoELITE, another market analyst, highlighted the token‚Äôs positive technical indicators, asserting that the cryptocurrency could experience a substantial rise if the current bullish trend continues. CryptoELITE based this forecast on the formation of a symmetrical triangle pattern on the token‚Äôs price chart, which began after the coin‚Äôs surge to $0.00004567 in March 2024. Since then, the coin has been consolidating within this formation, leading the analyst to predict that SHIB could break out reaching a target price of $0.00023. Alan Santana , a market expert, shares a similar outlook, setting a target of $0.00023 for the token during the upcoming bull run. Santana suggests that the price movement could occur within the year, further supporting the notion of an imminent breakout. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Current Price and Market Sentiment At the time of press, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading at $0.00002276, reflecting a 0.63% decrease on the day. While the price has shown some upward movement, it is clear that analysts expect the cryptocurrency to experience a more substantial surge if it breaks free from its current price consolidation. CryptoELITE and Santana predict that the breakout could send the token to a new price level of $0.00023, a significant increase from its current position.

DOGE Millionaires Move Forward With $5 Million Bet For WallitIQ (WLTQ) To Rally 50,900%",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/dogecoin-price-set-for-parabolic-breakout-doge-millionaires-move-forward-with-5-million-bet-for-wallitiq-wltq-to-rally-50900/,"While Dogecoin (DOGE) is preparing for what analysts predict could be a parabolic breakout, the real buzz is around WallitIQ (WLTQ), a groundbreaking AI-powered platform that‚Äôs transforming crypto wallet management. DOGE millionaires, known for their early bets on meme coins, are now placing significant wagers on the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token , betting on its 50,900% rally potential to outshine Dogecoin price gains in 2025. WallitIQ (WLTQ): A Revolution In Crypto Wallets With 50,900% Growth Potential The WallitIQ (WLTQ) platform is setting a new standard in decentralized finance by combining cutting-edge AI technology with unmatched token utility . The platform offers users a secure, efficient, and intuitive experience for managing their digital assets. But what truly makes the WallitIQ (WLTQ) platform stand out is its potential to deliver a massive return on investment, with DOGE millionaires already eyeing a 50,900% price rally by 2025. At the core of WallitIQ‚Äôs (WLTQ) innovation is its AI-powered wallet that removes common pain points for crypto users. Instead of manually converting cryptocurrencies to cover transaction fees, users can pay gas fees directly with the native WLTQ token. This cost-effective solution also offers discounts to those using WLTQ for transactions, making it an essential tool for active traders. The WallitIQ (WLTQ) platform keeps users updated with real-time on-chain notifications, guaranteeing that they never miss important wallet activity. Its advanced security, with biometric and facial recognition features, provides top-tier protection against unauthorized access. WallitIQ (WLTQ) provides an innovative MVP build app that offers real-time crypto pricing through the CoinGecko API, allowing users to track market movements and view interactive candlestick charts. Additionally, WallitIQ (WLTQ) provides AI-driven predictive analytics that helps users anticipate market trends. As crypto markets move fast, having this level of insight can mean the difference between capturing massive gains or missing out. For early investors, holding WLTQ tokens comes with incredible perks, including reduced transaction fees, staking rewards of up to 180% APY , and access to premium features. The presale price of $0.0420 presents a golden opportunity to acquire WLTQ before its expected rally. To put into perspective, a modest $1,000 investment can turn into $510,000; a $10,000 investment can grow to $5.1 million, and a $100,000 investment could explode into $51 million. These numbers are staggering, and early adopters who secure their tokens now stand to benefit the most. If you invest just $1,000 today, you could be sitting on half a million dollars by the time WLTQ hits its projected price. This window of opportunity is closing fast. With DOGE millionaires and savvy investors rushing to secure their positions, the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale is your chance to lock in life-changing gains before the token price skyrockets. Why DOGE Millionaires Are Betting On WallitIQ (WLTQ) Dogecoin price predictions are currently optimistic, with analysts suggesting that a parabolic breakout could be on the horizon. However, even DOGE millionaires, who have profited immensely from the previous Dogecoin price parabolic breakout, are now moving a whopping $5 million into WallitIQ‚Äôs presale because WallitIQ (WLTQ) offers utility, innovation, and a clear path to sustained growth, something that Dogecoin lacks. With a CoinMarketCap listing and SolidProof smart contract audit , the project is fully secure and transparent. DOGE millionaires recognize that the WallitIQ (WLTQ) platform solves critical issues in crypto wallet management, making it a more promising investment for the next bull run. The potential for the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token to outperform Dogecoin is hard to ignore. DOGE millionaires understand that securing tokens at $0.0420 before the anticipated 50,900% rally could result in massive wealth creation. In contrast, even a parabolic breakout for the Dogecoin price is unlikely to match the WLTQ token‚Äôs projected gains. Dogecoin Price: Can It Deliver Another Parabolic Breakout? Over the years, the Dogecoin price has experienced several parabolic breakouts, often fueled by hype from social media influencers. However, DOGE‚Äôs recent performance has been less impressive, leaving investors wondering if the next parabolic breakout will be substantial enough to generate life-changing wealth. Analysts believe that Dogecoin‚Äôs price could see a parabolic breakout in the coming months, especially if the broader crypto market enters a bull cycle. Yet, even with a potential rally, the Dogecoin price is unlikely to match that of WallitIQ (WLTQ). DOGE millionaires know this and are diversifying their portfolios by participating in the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale. Rather than hope for a Dogecoin price parabolic breakout, smart investors like the DOGE millionaires have locked in early access to the WallitIQ (WLTQ) platform that‚Äôs projected to deliver 50,900% returns Conclusion: Secure Your Future With WallitIQ (WLTQ) Before The Window Closes The crypto market is on the brink of a major shift, and DOGE millionaires and savvy investors are already positioning themselves for the next bull run. While Dogecoin price could see a parabolic breakout, the smart money is moving toward WallitIQ (WLTQ) , a platform that offers far greater potential for life-changing gains. The fact that DOGE millionaires are betting millions on WallitIQ (WLTQ) should be a clear signal to all investors. The presale price of $0.0420 won‚Äôt last long, and once WallitIQ (WLTQ) hits the open market, the price is expected to surge by 50,900%. Imagine turning a $1,000 investment into $510,000 or a $10,000 investment into $5.1 million. The right time to act is now. Don‚Äôt wait forthe Dogecoin price to make headlines again. Join the ranks of DOGE millionaires who have already made the switch to WallitIQ (WLTQ). With its AI-driven solutions, top-notch security features, and game-changing utility, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is poised to become one of the most valuable tokens in DeFi. The crypto bull run of 2025 is fast approaching. Make sure you‚Äôre holding WLTQ when it happens. Buy now, secure your future, and don‚Äôt miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to create wealth.

Musk AI Boost (MUSKAIBO), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKAIBO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk AI Boost can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk AI Boost could become the next viral memecoin. Musk AI Boost launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk AI Boost on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk AI Boost by entering its contract address ‚Äì 72pTcxNcaiTgNRSbCHaAPS97WFRdWwpfqbQdqEi7JP8J ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKAIBO. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|DOGE|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-20 03:23:00

OFFICIAL TRUMP has quickly achieved a top ten fully diluted market capitalization in less than three days of trading. While the coin's valuation is high, the Tokenomics of TRUMP are dubious, with no observable utility and a high level of dilution over just 3 years. The big winner here is Solana, which is the blockchain chosen by the President (and/or his team) for his official memecoin launch. President Donald Trump is back. If there have been any doubts about '47' overseeing crypto industry-friendly regulatory policy, US-based digital asset companies may have just been given the biggest reassurance an incoming President can possibly give before being inaugurated; the Trump team has officially launched a crypto coin. In less than three full days of trading, OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP) briefly achieved a top ten fully diluted market capitalization: $TRUMP (CoinMarketCap) At one point on January 19th, $TRUMP had a $72 billion fully diluted market cap. This made $TRUMP briefly the most valuable memecoin in the market and give the coin the 7th largest valuation of any coin. We're going to get into all of the reasons why you probably shouldn't buy this coin in a moment. But before we get to that, please remember that the barrier to entry for meme-coin creation is virtually nothing. Because of this, there are literally dozens of ""TRUMP"" coins that could be purchased rather than the 'official' coin if prospective buyers aren't careful: Other 'TRUMP' Coins (CoinMarketCap) One certainly wouldn't want to accidentally purchase 'trumpwifhat' - a derivative of dogwifhat ( WIF-USD ) - instead of OFFICIAL TRUMP; each of which uses TRUMP as the symbol. So if you're actually interested in plowing into a meme coin at a $72 billion fully diluted valuation, make sure you know the correct contract address before you incinerate your capital. TRUMP is Not An Investment Anyone looking at TRUMP as an investment opportunity should consider that President Trump's own disclosure overtly says that the coin should not be viewed as such: Trump Memes are intended to function as an expression of support for, and engagement with, the ideals and beliefs embodied by the symbol ""$TRUMP"" and the associated artwork, and are not intended to be, or to be the subject of, an investment opportunity, investment contract, or security of any type. So, now that we know TRUMP should not be viewed as an investment, we can dive into the supply dynamics and holder data. Tokenomics and Distribution As far as I can tell, there is no utility for TRUMP whatsoever. In the past, NFTs released by Trump have offered token holders potential perks or privileges when purchased at a certain scale; for instance, meet and greet opportunities. However, no such perks appear to exist for TRUMP holders. Thus, the inflation of TRUMP supply and its distribution will likely play a large role in how this coin performs over time: TRUMP Token Distribution (GetTrumpMemes.com) There are a total of 1 billion TRUMP coins, 800 million of which are owned by ""creators and CIC Digital."" President Trump has an ownership stake in CIC Digital, though it is unclear how much TRUMP he owns through that entity. Regardless, at an 80% token allocation to the creators and CIC Digital, TRUMP has one of the more dilutive coin distributions that I can recall seeing in this market. TRUMP Emission Schedule (GetTrumpMemes.com) To be sure, there have been other coins that have launched with 80% of supply in lockup, but I don't know if I can remember seeing one where the total supply is unlocked within 3 years. Furthermore, the lockup periods begin in just 3 months and the emission schedule appears to show circulating supply doubling within 12 months. Meaning, TRUMP dilution is going to be quite quick compared to some of the other coins that I've covered for Seeking Alpha in the past. Early Trading Data Through less than three full days of trading, interest in TRUMP has been robust. There has been over $52 billion in total transfer value of the TRUMP coin and $32.2 billion in DEX trading value. The coin has quickly scaled to over three quarters of a million total token holders. However, most of those holders have very small allocations based on the Top 20 holder data: TRUMP Holders (SolScan) Again, 80% of supply is locked for creators and CIC Digital. Another 4% or so is held cumulatively by various centralized exchanges like OKX and Kraken. We can see an absolutely enormous percentage of TRUMP is held by the top 20 addresses. 88.5% of the total coin supply is held by just 20 wallets. If it hasn't been deduced by the reader at this point already, I'll be overt; I wouldn't buy this coin with free money. Like TRUMP? Buy Solana The biggest winner here is perhaps Solana USD ( SOL-USD ). While there is certainly an argument to be made that $TRUMP is simply cannibalizing liquidity from all of the other memecoins on the Solana Blockchain, there is no question the coin launch is bringing fresh liquidity to Solana through the President's non-crypto native supports. The price of SOL has been a large out-performer on the launch of TRUMP. Rallying over 40% from the January 16th close in just 3 days, SOL has made a new all-time high at $295 as of January 19th. L1 P/F Ratios (Token Terminal) And at just 82x circulating fees, SOL is the second cheapest L1 blockchain gas token when viewed through the price to annualized fee ratio. So if all of this activity isn't totally off-putting, I think the right way to play President Trump's memecoin on Solana is simply buying Solana. Closing Thoughts I don't think that I've made it any real secret on Seeking Alpha or on my Substack newsletter that I'm generally not a fan of memecoins. In my opinion, there is an element of financial nihilism that is pervasive through most of the memecoin segment that I don't think has been helpful to broader sentiment about digital assets or public blockchains as a legitimately useful innovation. But I do think the broader implications of TRUMP are compelling. On one hand, we could look back at this moment 5 to 10 years from now and see a memecoin launch from a US President - and subsequently his wife as well - as a clear sign of a market top. On the other hand, we could look back at this moment 5 to 10 years from now and see it as the certification of progress in financial technology. Readers can place their own chips on that one. For me, TRUMP is untouchable and SOL is worth some long term speculative capital.",SOL-USD,EN,0,0,SOL|REGULATION|TRADING|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-01-20 03:23:57

Koji Higashi‚Äôs company Diamond Hands is also facing issues, recently announcing a pivot away from their Lightning Network community node. The broken protocol that‚Äôs just 2 years away from being ready doesn‚Äôt seem to be doing them any favors. Still, the Japanese entrepreneur lamented and mentioned ‚Äúdespair‚Äù in an X post about the latest meme coin, Official Trump . Is TRUMP just another meme coin or ‚ÄòThe sh*ttiness of the industry‚Äô? Indeed, the massive political capture of crypto ‚Äî that was once supposed to be about separation of money and state ‚Äîis nauseating to anyone, like Higashi , who‚Äôs been in the game more than five years. But there is no rationality to manipulated markets. Trump, who has promised to free Silk Road darknet marketplace founder Ross Ulbricht ‚Äú on day one ‚Äù (amongst a plethora of other assurances) has now launched a website for his own premined, crypto just before being stepping into his White House role once again, tomorrow. The website for Trump‚Äôs stunt amusingly reads that the coin has nothing to do with politics. It further lays out the premined nature of the coin in small print at the bottom of the page: ‚ÄúCIC Digital LLC, an affiliate of The Trump Organization, and Fight Fight Fight LLC collectively own 80% of the Trump Cards, subject to a 3-year unlocking schedule.‚Äù Tokenomics show the asset‚Äôs heavily premined and centrally captured nature (Source: gettrumpmemes.com) Higashi noted in another X post that some people who used to support bitcoin are now turning away due to this meme coin. He also stated that ‚Äúthe people who originally got interested in Bitcoin got into it because they didn‚Äôt like this kind of thing, so it‚Äôs like a polar opposite world.‚Äù However, the coin‚Äôs team says on his self-congratulatory site, ‚Äú‚Ä¶ President Trump showed the world what a LEADER is made of.

The hourly chart also indicates a consolidation phase, as Bitcoin fell from $106K to $101K. Major altcoins are following a similar trend, and it remains to be seen how the market will react after Donald Trump‚Äôs presidential inauguration.

Every buy order is simply matched by a sell order. And after an initial spike, the price eventually crashes and the last buyers lose everything,‚Äù he posted, calling memecoins a zero-sum ‚Äì even negative sum after exchange fees ‚Äì lottery. Balaji said that memecoins should be approached in the same way as gambling in Las Vegas for entertainment purposes. ‚ÄúMost should buy assets that retain their value over the long run,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúIt is sometimes possible to add use cases to a memecoin, or to keep it in the headlines to keep its value aloft indefinitely. And we‚Äôve seen examples of that as well.‚Äù In response to the post, many asked Balaji if bitcoin was ever considered a memecoin, to which he argued that it wasn‚Äôt because of its use cases and decade-plus staying power. ‚ÄúBitcoin is the base layer asset of a blockchain with ~800 Th/s in hashrate across hundreds of datacenters worldwide,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúIt grew gradually over time, rather than all at once, and the mining issuance schedule limits how much can be sold by any one party.‚Äù Market interest in the official Trump memecoin has sucked liquidity out of other memecoins, with CoinGecko data reporting that the category has shrunk by 8% in the last 24 hours.

The meme coin was released just days before Trump‚Äôs inauguration as the 47th President of the United States. Critics have raised concerns that the timing of the release may be an attempt by Trump to cash in on his presidency. There is a growing concern that this move could fuel speculation, with investors rushing to capitalize on the hype before the value crashes. In light of this, attorney John Deaton has weighed in on the broader state of the cryptocurrency market, particularly in relation to ongoing legal cases involving major crypto players like Ripple, Coinbase, Kraken, and LBRY. Deaton, who has been heavily involved in filing amicus briefs for users, developers, and investors, expressed frustration with the resources and energy spent on these cases over the past few years. He said that many of these legal battles‚Äîparticularly the SEC‚Äôs case against Ripple‚Äîare non-fraud cases, meaning that the companies involved have not engaged in fraudulent activity, yet they have incurred massive legal expenses and losses.

Despite their efforts to cooperate, these companies are still being targeted by regulators. Deaton stressed that if a new ‚ÄúGolden Age of Innovation‚Äù is indeed on the horizon, the SEC should dismiss these non-fraud cases in order to allow companies like Ripple, Coinbase, and others to thrive without the burden of legal battles.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE|XRP|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-20 04:17:54

He emphasized that advancements in U.S. regulatory frameworks will be a major catalyst for this progress, enabling the stablecoin market to grow and achieve widespread adoption. According to McDonald, regulatory clarity will play a critical role in setting the stage for innovation, standardization, and increased trust in stablecoins. He expressed confidence in Ripple‚Äôs ability to lead this evolution with its USD-pegged stablecoin, RLUSD. ‚ÄúAs U.S. regulation advances, standards will evolve, innovation will expand, and real utility will take off,‚Äù he wrote in a recent social media post, underscoring Ripple‚Äôs readiness to drive this shift. Growing Stablecoin Market and Ripple‚Äôs Position The stablecoin sector has shown consistent growth, with a current market capitalization approaching $216 billion. Projections indicate that this figure could surge to nearly $3 trillion within the next five years, highlighting the expanding role of stablecoins in global finance. Ripple‚Äôs RLUSD, which debuted on December 17, has been introduced as part of this broader trend. The stablecoin was specifically designed to meet the rising demand for USD-denominated stablecoins, particularly in regions such as Asia-Pacific (APAC), the European Union (EU), and Australia. By leveraging blockchain technology, RLUSD aims to strengthen Ripple‚Äôs cross-border payment offerings, a critical area for global financial connectivity. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple‚Äôs Expansion Beyond Cross-Border Payments Ripple initially gained recognition for its blockchain-based cross-border payment solutions. Over the years, the company has expanded its capabilities to include asset tokenization, custody solutions, and other enterprise applications. Ripple Payments has facilitated over $70 billion in transactions, cementing its role as a major player in blockchain-driven financial services. The introduction of RLUSD aligns with Ripple‚Äôs vision to enhance its payment ecosystem. As a USD-pegged stablecoin, RLUSD is issued on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and Ethereum blockchains, offering flexibility and accessibility for users. Ripple aims to capitalize on the growing integration of stablecoins into the financial system by providing a reliable, blockchain-powered alternative for USD transactions. Implications of U.S. Regulation McDonald‚Äôs prediction hinges on the advancement of regulatory policies in the United States, which has lagged behind other jurisdictions in providing comprehensive guidelines for stablecoins. Clearer regulatory standards are expected to address concerns related to transparency, security, and compliance, ultimately fostering greater confidence among institutional and retail users. With stablecoins rapidly becoming integral to the payments landscape, 2025 could mark a turning point for their adoption and utility. RLUSD is expected to help drive this momentum, supported by the company‚Äôs broader efforts to redefine global payment systems through blockchain technology.

The selling pressure was so strong that Solana, $SOL , the cryptocurrency itself, fell nearly 20% in minutes. The trade went from a rush to the entrance to a rush to the exit.

This imbalance contributed to the decline in TRUMP‚Äôs price. Kobeissi Letter also noted that the selling pressure on TRUMP spilled over to Solana ( SOL ), causing its value to drop by nearly 20% in minutes.

Trump the Solana King (TRUMPKIN), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPKIN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Trump the Solana King can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump the Solana King could become the next viral memecoin. Trump the Solana King launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.

According to the press release shared with CryptoPotato , the network aims to onboard 25 million users and 25,000 developers, significantly expanding its community and technical contributions. Base also plans to scale its blockspace capacity to 250 Mgas/s, to enable faster and more efficient transactions, while targeting $100 billion in total assets on the platform. Base Unveils Ambitious 2025 Goals Base has outlined its 2025 strategy through five key focus areas. First, it aims to empower developers by creating open tools, including OnchainKit and support for AI-driven apps, to streamline app development and adoption. Second, it seeks to foster a robust ecosystem of on-chain applications, focusing on distribution, monetization, and improving core functionalities like social, trading, payments, and messaging. Third, Base plans to simplify user experience by ramping up its Smart Wallet, to facilitate quick onboarding, seamless app interactions, and secure management of assets and identities. Fourth, it aims to become a hub for global on-chain markets by increasing asset liquidity. ‚ÄúWe will decentralize, scale, and accelerate Base to enable everyone, everywhere to come on-chain. The only way we can build a truly global economy is by making sure it‚Äôs built on a decentralized, open platform ‚Äì and we are proud to do this as part of Ethereum and the Superchain.‚Äù Base TVL Growth The roadmap follows a milestone in November when Base hit $10 billion in total value locked (TVL) for the first time. The figure has since increased by over 50% as the TVL of the Layer 2 now stands at $15.2 billion, as per data compiled by L2Beat. Base is currently, the second Ethereum Layer 2 network trailing closely behind Arbitrum which has a TVL of $18.09 billion. The growth of Layer 2 networks played a crucial role in the Ethereum ecosystem last year and data suggests that this trend will continue going forward. For instance, in its latest report , Fidelity expressed optimism about the performance and adoption of Layer 2s in 2025, stating that these solutions are expected to build on the momentum gained in 2024, with a focus on reducing transaction costs, improving transaction speed, and enhancing cross-chain interoperability. ‚ÄúThe continued innovation in Layer 2 technology will make DeFi more accessible and scalable, potentially attracting more institutional investors and enterprises.

While signaling deregulation, I think the coin's tokenomics could hurt crypto‚Äôs short-term credibility. I believe the coin may give opponents arguments against Bitcoin as a U.S. strategic reserve, deterring institutional interest. 90% of Trump's meme coin supply is controlled by ""Creators"". Listings on centralized exchanges could increase risks for investors and damage crypto‚Äôs reputation. Trump‚Äôs meme coin launch may however signal a broader trend of crypto deregulation, which could create a more favorable environment for Bitcoin‚Äôs growth as a neutral, decentralized global reserve asset. Despite short-term risks, I believe Bitcoin remains promising as a global reserve asset, with deregulation likely to boost its long-term growth. In this article, I explain why I see the launch of Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúmeme coin‚Äù as a slightly negative catalyst for Bitcoin ( BTC-USD) in the short term but a positive one in the mid and long term. This belief is rooted in the fact that broader crypto deregulation (signalled by the launch of this coin) will ultimately support Bitcoin‚Äôs maturing as the dominant ecosystem. I will start by describing what a meme coin is and sharing my thoughts on the tokenomics of Trump‚Äôs meme coin - meaning its economics related to supply, distribution, and utility. Then, I will analyze the good, the bad, and the ugly of what this launch means for Bitcoin, in my opinion. Readers familiar with the crypto space may wish to skip the first section and go directly to my analysis of its implications for Bitcoin. This article is not intended as a recommendation to trade Trump‚Äôs meme coin or any other meme coin or blockchain project. All crypto projects mentioned are based on my own research and experience and should not be taken as investment advice. What is a ‚ÄúMeme Coin‚Äù and what did Trump do? A meme coin is a cryptocurrency inspired by internet memes, jokes, or pop culture, often created with little to no utility or underlying value. Its value tends to rely solely on community hype and social media trends rather than fundamental factors. DJT's trump tweet announcing his meme coin (X.com) Donald J. Trump announced on Friday the launch of a Trump meme coin, with ticker $TRUMP . This meme coin was launched on Solana USD ( SOL-USD ), a popular blockchain that competes with Ethereum USD ( ETH-USD ). As a crypto enthusiast, it took me a good 30 minutes to figure out which one was exactly Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúofficial meme coin‚Äù, as there are dozens of meme coins with similar names available on Ethereum, Solana and other chains. Interestingly, even Seeking Alpha features a ‚ÄúTrumpCoin USD‚Äù ( TRUMP-USD ), which is NOT Trump‚Äôs official meme coin, but rather another unrelated meme coin launched in May last year. The challenge in identifying the ""correct"" Trump meme coin is partly due to the fact that, at the time of writing, this can only be purchased through decentralized exchanges (DEXs). These are blockchain-based platforms that use smart contracts to facilitate trading without a central entity or control, unlike centralized exchanges (CEXs) such as Coinbase, Inc. ( COIN ). To make matters more complicated, the Trump meme coin is only available on those DEXs which deal with Solana, its underlying blockchain. An example of such a DEX is Moonshot, which is what the official website of the Trump meme coin suggests to people interested in buying it. Another popular option for Solana, which I personally sometimes use, is raydium.io. Using a DEX implies having a hot wallet that works with the Solana blockchain, and some level of technical understanding of the crypto space. Trump‚Äôs meme coin tokenomics: not great Trump's meme coin white paper (gettrumpmemes.com) What stands out from Trump‚Äôs meme coin ‚Äúwhite paper,‚Äù in my view, is that only about 10% of Trump‚Äôs meme coin supply is available for trading during this initial phase. The remaining 90% is locked by what the official website refers to as ‚ÄúCreators‚Äù and is planned for gradual release over the next 36 months. I find these tokenomics concerning, as they allow the ""Creators"" to potentially liquidate their holdings unexpectedly, which could harm investors. This type of setup is often associated with ‚Äú rug pulls ‚Äù in the crypto space, where creators dump their tokens, leaving investors with significant losses. A prominent example occurred earlier this year when a U.S. social media influencer faced backlash after her token was rug-pulled. That said, the creators‚Äô control over the majority of Trump‚Äôs meme coin supply does not guarantee a rug pull. This ultimately depends on their actions. Additionally, it‚Äôs worth noting that Trump‚Äôs meme coin website includes a prominent disclaimer stating that the coin is not an investment opportunity but rather a symbolic expression of support for the incoming U.S. president. Trump Memes are intended to function as an expression of support for, and engagement with, the ideals and beliefs embodied by the symbol ""$TRUMP"" and the associated artwork, and are not intended to be, or to be the subject of, an investment opportunity, investment contract, or security of any type. GetTrumpMemes.com is not political and has nothing to do with any political campaign or any political office or governmental agency. Personally, I don‚Äôt see the relevance of Trump‚Äôs meme coin to the crypto space or Bitcoin as having anything to do with its viability as an investment - it‚Äôs not, and I strongly encourage readers not to view it that way. What does this mean for Bitcoin? The good, the bad, the ugly. I believe Bitcoin possesses all the technical qualities required to become a superior global reserve asset: durability, divisibility, fungibility, portability, verifiability, and scarcity. Given these attributes, I see Bitcoin at current levels as an asymmetric bet on its potential adoption as a global reserve asset, complementing and partially replacing gold and fiat currencies held by major nations as reserves. Author's model for BTC valuation (Author's own work) My model for evaluating Bitcoin is outlined in the table above. In my most recent update , I revised the expected value range to $112,500 to $200,000 per Bitcoin . While I won‚Äôt dive deeper into the details of my model in this article, I encourage readers to explore my previous work and thoughts on Bitcoin, available on my Seeking Alpha profile . In the context of this model, viewing Bitcoin as an asymmetric bet, a critical factor will be whether the U.S. adopts a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve. Senator Cynthia Lummis has introduced a ‚Äú Bitcoin Act ‚Äù to Congress, and Trump has pledged during his campaign to support such legislation. In the following paragraphs, I will discuss the good, the bad and the ugly of how I believe the launch of Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúmeme coin‚Äù could influence Bitcoin. Of particular importance is its impact on the likelihood of the U.S. adopting a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve. The good: Deregulation A US president launching a meme coin just two days before his inauguration is something that I personally could have never imagined happening just one year ago. At that time, SEC Chair Gary Gensler was just barely conceding defeat in a multi-year battle against approving Bitcoin ETFs after losing a pivotal court case . In my view, this is a clear signal we are entering a new deregulation era for crypto. Donald Trump has campaigned heavily on overall deregulation , including deregulating the banking and crypto industries. The launch of the Trump meme coin happened the Friday before Gary Gensler‚Äôs official day of resignation - Monday, January 20th 2025. I believe this is no coincidence. The Trump‚Äôs administration has shaped up to be very crypto-friendly, with nominations such as Paul Atkins as new SEC chair and Gail Slater as head of the Justice Department‚Äôs antitrust division. I see the launch of this crypto project as yet another signal that this administration is going to heavily deregulate and incentivize the Crypto industry on US soil. Readers who, like me, trust in the market‚Äôs ability to self-regulate and view government intervention as something to minimize, will likely agree that this is a positive catalyst for both Bitcoin and the broader US economy. Of course, readers who believe governments should be heavily involved in regulation might disagree with my view. Personally, I‚Äôm not a fan of meme coins or any other blockchain projects outside of Bitcoin. While I observe the broader crypto space with interest, my exposure is overwhelmingly focused on Bitcoin, which makes up more than 95% of my crypto holdings. Despite my Bitcoin-first perspective, I view broader crypto deregulation as a positive for Bitcoin . I believe Bitcoin, as the only mature and truly neutral, decentralized blockchain project, is best positioned to outperform other projects in the long term. This is especially true in relation to Bitcoin as a global reserve asset that might complement the role of gold. The bad: meme coins ‚Äúinvestors‚Äù beware There is no doubt in my mind that Trump‚Äôs meme coin tokenomics are potentially a dangerous setup. While I believe the project‚Äôs website is very clear about this meme coin not being an investment, I still see a risk that some people might lose money if they put significant amounts of money into this meme coin. This might very well happen even if the meme coin does not go through a ‚Äúrug pull,‚Äù but simply stagnates or slowly declines in value over time. I believe the fact that the Trump meme coin is only available to purchase via DEXs has ‚Äúshielded‚Äù most investors so far. Many, in my view, are simply not savvy enough about the crypto space to go through the process of buying this coin via a DEX. However, this is bound to change soon. Coinbase and other CEXs have already announced they plan to list Trump‚Äôs meme coin. I see this as a significant risk that will put people in danger of losing money and ‚Äútarnish‚Äù the reputation of cryptocurrencies (and, by reflection, Bitcoin) at scale. As a proponent of free markets, ultimately I don‚Äôt view this risk as a fundamental issue - one could argue that reckless investors and gamblers should be aware of the risks they‚Äôre taking. However, I still see it as a ‚Äúbad‚Äù short-term catalyst for Bitcoin, as it could deter investors, particularly institutional ones, from engaging with Bitcoin. The ugly: A potential argument against a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Readers might believe that a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve is more likely to happen when the US president launches a meme coin. I disagree. I believe Trump might have handed his opponents a powerful argument against the adoption of a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve by launching his own meme coin with such short notice before installation. Trump's administration now holds control over the House of Representatives, the Senate, and the Presidency. Additionally, six of the nine Supreme Court justices were appointed by Trump, giving his administration significant influence across all branches of government. Despite this apparent dominance, I believe the passage of a ‚ÄúBitcoin Act‚Äù would still require committee reviews, debates, and amendments. Bipartisan support would also be preferable to ensure the long-term viability of a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve for the U.S. However, I believe this now seems less likely following the launch of Trump‚Äôs meme coin with questionable tokenomics. Political opponents may challenge the idea of a Bitcoin Reserve, questioning whether it should include other cryptocurrencies or arguing that Trump‚Äôs associates appear to have financially benefited from the meme coin‚Äôs launch. This could fuel opposition to Bitcoin adoption, framing it as a means of enriching Trump‚Äôs circle rather than a strategic decision for the U.S. economy. Polymarket - chances of BTC reserve in the first 100 days of Trump's admin (Polymarket.com) Polymarket, a blockchain-based prediction platform that accurately forecasted Trump‚Äôs election victory, currently places the likelihood of a Bitcoin reserve being established within the first 100 days of Trump‚Äôs administration at 42%. This is a notable increase from the 25% probability I observed during my last update to my Bitcoin model. However, I personally believe that the launch of Trump‚Äôs meme coin may have undermined the credibility of his incoming administration in the eyes of many. This, in my view, reduces the likelihood of Bitcoin being adopted by the U.S. as a strategic reserve and is a net negative catalyst for Bitcoin in the short term. Risks This article is not intended as a recommendation or suggestion to trade any cryptocurrency, including Trump‚Äôs meme coin. Cryptocurrencies, particularly meme coins, are highly speculative and carry substantial risks. As a crypto enthusiast, I was surprised to see the sheer number of Trump-themed coins currently in circulation. Beyond the challenge of even simply identifying and accessing Trump‚Äôs official meme coin, this type of trade involves significant risks, including lack of regulation, potential fraud, and extreme price volatility. Investors should proceed with caution and be fully aware of these risks. Regarding my thoughts on what Trump‚Äôs meme coin means for Bitcoin, I acknowledge that I could be wrong. Deregulation of the cryptocurrency space could lead to chaos in this space, potentially permanently undermining Bitcoin's chances of emerging as the dominant blockchain ecosystem for a digital reserve asset and scaring investors away from this asset class. Conversely, I may also be wrong in assuming that Trump‚Äôs meme coin launch is reducing the chances of the U.S. adopting Bitcoin as a strategic reserve. The Trump administration could move quickly to pass its ‚ÄúBitcoin Act,‚Äù and the meme coin might ultimately simply prove to be a lighthearted way to engage supporters and rally political enthusiasm. Conclusion I view the launch of Trump‚Äôs official meme coin as a slightly net negative catalyst for Bitcoin in the short term. Political opponents may use it as a case study to argue that crypto-related legislation, including the adoption of Bitcoin as a reserve asset, primarily serves to enrich Trump‚Äôs associates rather than benefit the United States as a whole. While I personally disagree with this assessment and view Trump‚Äôs meme coin simply as a fun way to engage with his audience, it remains a political risk that could undermine the likelihood of the US adopting Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset in the near future. On the positive side, I see Trump‚Äôs meme coin as a symptom and signal of a broader trend for this upcoming administration: deregulation. As a proponent of free markets, I believe this is a long-term positive catalyst for the US economy and for the crypto industry. I‚Äôm confident that Bitcoin will thrive in a deregulated crypto environment, emerging as the most mature, neutral, and truly decentralized blockchain - one that possesses all the necessary characteristics to become a global reserve asset.",BTC-USD,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-01-20 04:34:37

The altcoin has been consolidating just below its all-time high territory, and while the market remains in a mixed phase, the outlook is still positive. At the time of writing, XRP is down and is trading at $3.10 levels. Support Levels and Short-Term Outlook XRP is caught in a period of consolidation, hovering just below key resistance levels, particularly the breakout point at around $3.40. The support area is clearly defined between $2.52 and $2.94, and as long as this range holds, the bullish bias remains intact. A drop below $2.52, however, would challenge the short-term bullish thesis and may require a revision of market expectations. Market Structure and Key Resistance The market recently surged by 72% after breaking out of a triangle pattern, which was completed on January 13. However, the price is still below a critical resistance level, and this zone has historically been tough to break through. The all-time high remains a hurdle for XRP, but it is not surprising to see the market consolidate before attempting another push higher. Euphoria in the Market: A Sign of Potential Rallies There‚Äôs a surge in market enthusiasm, which could act as a catalyst for a rally in the coming weeks. While euphoria is often seen during the final leg of an uptrend, it is important to remain cautious as blow-off tops can form in such conditions, especially with Bitcoin and other major assets. Key Levels to Watch for the Next Upside The next important upside targets for XRP, if the support levels hold, are $4.19 and $5.00. The $4.19 mark represents a smaller Fibonacci extension, while the $5 level is a more significant target. A decisive move above these levels would set the stage for further gains and potentially a new rally.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-20 04:55:15

During this shaky phase for Pepe, many holders were nostalgic for its glory days in late 2023 and early 2024, when Pepe (PEPE) skyrocketed over 3,000%. Many ambitious holders looking to recreate this scenario are turning their attention to Remittix, a revolutionary new PayFi protocol that is positioned optimally to tap into the lucrative $190 trillion cross border payments market. So what is so special about Remittix and how will it stack up against Pepe in 2025? Pepe Posts 16.88% Increase In 7 Days Pepe (PEPE) has experienced notable volatility as 2025 unfolds. Currently trading at approximately $0.00002003, it has seen a 10.07% increase in the last 24 hours. Despite this short-term uptick, Pepe remains about 29.52% below its all time high reached in early December. The market capitalization of Pepe stands at approximately $8.42 billion, reflecting its relevance in the meme coin space. However, on chain analytics indicate that many whales have been reducing their positions, contributing to downward pressure on the price. The future trajectory of Pepe (PEPE) remains unclear, though it looks like things could easily go either way.

But their weekly gain is more impressive, with XLM recording 7.5% gain while XRP records 23.7% gain. Meanwhile, RTX token, the native currency of Remittix, a project revolutionizing the $190 trillion cross-border payments market is set to debut on major exchanges. Experts analysis capture this token with numerous use cases set to rival XLM and XRP. Stellar (XLM) Consolidating Following Bullish Breakout XLM broke out from a bullish pattern on January 15. However, the coin has been consolidating since then with long term holders accumulating more tokens, per on chain analytics from Coinglass. Also, netflow analysis shows that $20 million worth of XLM left exchanges over the past three days. This significant outflow, following a bullish breakout, is considered an ideal opportunity. Meanwhile, price history and technical indicators show that XLM could reach $0.65, a 25% rise if its daily candle closes above the $0.50 level. Currently, Stellar is trading at $0.4572 after an impressive 34% rise in the past month. Relative Strength Index (RSI) also indicates the token is below the overbought zone, providing opportunities for upside moves. However, reaching this price point may depend on the general market trend. XRP Rallies Amid Bullish Indicators XRP‚Äôs price could go further from its current price at $3.10, according to experts‚Äô analysis and on chain metrics. LbiDefi, an independent market analyst noted that the XRP‚Äôs RSI has bounced off the pivotal 50, a move often seen as the first sign of a bullish trend. Also, the token has reclaimed its daily moving average ribbon, an indicator for upward price action. The On-Balance Volume has also broken out, reinforcing the bullish view. ‚ÄúThe technical charts for XRP look exceptionally promising,‚Äù LbiDefi stated. Another analyst, Dark Defender, added to the optimism. He predicts XRP to reach new all time highs of $10.22 and $18.22 in the near term, a monumental surge from the current level. Its 600% rise since November to 3.40$ provides a foundation for future moves. Several reasons for bullish potential include the greenlight of a possible spot XRP ETF. The growing interest has seen XRP outpace Bitcoin in Google search trends for the first time. Additionally, increased adoption and expectations of regulatory clarity in the United States could contribute to XRP‚Äôs rally. Will Remittix Rival Stellar XLM and Ripple‚Äôs XRP? XLM and XRP are among the tokens with numerous utilities. Remittix also follows this pattern as it changes how international payments work by combining blockchain technology with traditional money systems. Remittix‚Äôs platform supports over 40 cryptocurrencies, allowing users to easily convert digital currencies like Bitcoin into fiat currencies such as USD and EUR. This creates a faster, cheaper alternative to traditional systems like SWIFT, which are often slow and expensive. Among its numerous advantages is Remittix‚Äôs open pricing. Remittix guarantees the recipient gets exactly what was sent by using a flat fee approach unlike other providers that include hidden charges. People and companies who wish for dependability and clarity in their transactions would notably benefit from this. Its use cases for businesses in particular how Remittix present a useful alternative for global payroll. Businesses can pay staff members cryptocurrency, the platform converts that into fiat and deposits it straight into staff bank accounts. This simplifies worldwide operations, lowers transaction costs and eliminates the complexities of conventional cross-border payments. Another use case that would make Remittix rival XLM and XRP is its security and user control factors. Eliminating outside participation allows the platform to provide consumers with complete transaction control. Furthermore, guaranteeing a safe and dependable system are audits conducted by reputable companies such as Solidproof and BlockSAFU. The team has frozen its tokens for three years to show its dedication to long term stability and establish confidence. Talking about the RTX token and why its price would outperform XLM and XRP, the coin in its ongoing token presale, has generated over $3.7 million. This means over 2 million of the token is sold with a unit price currently at $0.0221. Given its limited 1.5 billion coin supply, RTX appeals to driven traders. By 2025, experts estimate its value might explode and provide up to 100x returns. Investors that have keyed on this project have seen over 100%. Meanwhile, the token is set to increase in its presale price ahead of listing, providing anyone buying at this rate a 200% surge ahead of listing.

The overall crypto market capitalization has fallen by around 4%, now sitting at approximately $3.54 trillion . Let‚Äôs dive into the factors driving this decline. Trumps Accused of Pump and Dump Scheme One key event shaking the market involves accusations against Donald Trump and his team regarding a ‚Äúpump and dump‚Äù scheme. Over the weekend, Trump-backed memecoins, including the Official Trump (TRUMP) token and Melania Trump‚Äôs self-branded memecoin , launched and soared in value. Together, these tokens reached a combined market cap of over $15 billion. However, critics have accused the Trump family of manipulating the market for personal gain, which has created uncertainty among investors. Profit-Taking Hits Bitcoin Bitcoin, currently trading at $102,484 , has seen a minor drop of 2%. This comes after an impressive 10% surge since in the last weeks. However, short-term holders appear to be cashing in on profits, contributing to the current price dip. On-chain data from Santiment reveals that the 7-day Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio is nearing levels where investors typically book profits. Historically, when this indicator‚Äôs 7-day moving average (MA) reaches around 3%, a reversal tends to occur. Liquidations Add to the Pressure The market has also experienced heavy liquidations. According to CoinGlass , $1.18 billion worth of positions were liquidated in the past 24 hours as Bitcoin briefly dropped below $100,000. Long traders were hit the hardest, with $921 million in liquidations compared to $260 million in short positions. Binance recorded the largest single liquidation order, valued at $15.24 million. What Next For BTC? Despite the dip, Bitcoin‚Äôs breakout above $99,800 is seen as an important step forward. Experts believe the next key level to watch is $105,700. If Bitcoin moves past this, it could lead to higher prices. While some profit-taking may cause a pullback into the $99,100‚Äì$100,400 range, strong buying interest at these levels could reignite momentum.Using Fibonacci levels, Bitcoin‚Äôs next major target is projected at $120,362, signaling optimism for the weeks ahead.",News,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-20 05:26:13

Amid a month of notable developments, MicroStrategy's continued accumulation of Bitcoin and bold predictions from market analysts signal growing confidence in the asset's long-term potential. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market also saw the rise of OFFICIAL TRUMP (TRUMP), a meme coin tied to US President-elect Donald Trump, further highlighting the expanding influence of digital assets in mainstream discourse. As traders eye key resistance levels and lofty price targets, Bitcoin's journey into uncharted territory appears increasingly within reach. MicroStrategy's Bitcoin Crusade: Michael Saylor's Vision for BTC Adoption Intensifies MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor has once again demonstrated his unwavering commitment to Bitcoin, posting the SaylorTracker chart on Jan. 19 for the 11th consecutive week. The post hinted at another major Bitcoin purchase, marking another chapter in the firm‚Äôs ambitious Bitcoin acquisition strategy. On social media, Saylor wrote, ‚ÄúThings will be different tomorrow,‚Äù seemingly alluding to the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump on Jan. 20. This cryptic message, combined with Saylor's track record, has fueled speculation about MicroStrategy‚Äôs evolving Bitcoin strategy. MicroStrategy, already the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, added another 2,530 BTC on Jan. 13, 2025, valued at approximately $243 million at the time of purchase. This brings the company‚Äôs total holdings to an impressive 450,000 BTC, solidifying its dominance in corporate Bitcoin adoption. The company‚Äôs Bitcoin accumulation is part of its ambitious 21/21 plan, which aims to raise $42 billion through equity and fixed-income securities to fund its Bitcoin purchases. This bold strategy is part of MicroStrategy‚Äôs belief that Bitcoin is a superior store of value and a hedge against traditional financial risks. Michael Saylor has long advocated for Bitcoin's role in transforming global finance. His latest actions reinforce his belief that Bitcoin is the ultimate reserve asset for corporations, governments, and nations. Saylor has argued that the first country to adopt a debt-to-BTC strategy could position itself as a global economic leader. He has even urged the United States Treasury to convert its gold reserves into Bitcoin, suggesting that such a move could: Neutralize national debt: By leveraging Bitcoin's growth, the US could address its fiscal challenges more effectively than through traditional monetary strategies. Weaken adversaries: Converting gold to Bitcoin would diminish the value of gold reserves held by foreign competitors while strengthening US Bitcoin reserves. Position the US as a global digital leader: By adopting Bitcoin as a strategic reserve, the US could spearhead the transition to a digital-first economy. In December 2024, Saylor proposed a regulatory framework for the US that included the establishment of an $81 trillion Bitcoin strategic reserve. His framework also envisioned the digital asset market reaching a $10 trillion market capitalization and the broader digital asset capital markets expanding to $280 trillion. Calls for a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Gain Momentum Saylor is not alone in his push for Bitcoin adoption at the national level. Asset manager Anthony Pompliano has also championed the idea of a Bitcoin strategic reserve. In November 2024, Pompliano urged municipalities, state governments, and the federal government to acquire Bitcoin as quickly as possible. He emphasized the urgency of adopting Bitcoin before other nations capitalize on its potential. Pompliano echoed Saylor‚Äôs sentiments, warning that the US risks being ‚Äúfront-run‚Äù by countries that adopt Bitcoin earlier. He emphasized that the rapid accumulation of Bitcoin could yield massive economic advantages in the future. MicroStrategy‚Äôs continued Bitcoin accumulation sends a strong signal to both private and public sectors. The company‚Äôs success could set a precedent for other corporations and governments to follow suit. By demonstrating the viability of a debt-financed Bitcoin strategy, MicroStrategy is blazing a trail for others to explore the benefits of BTC as a reserve asset. However, this strategy is not without its risks. Critics have raised concerns about the volatility of Bitcoin and the potential consequences of such concentrated exposure. Nonetheless, Saylor remains undeterred, emphasizing that Bitcoin's long-term value far outweighs its short-term price fluctuations. As MicroStrategy continues to accumulate Bitcoin, the broader implications of its actions are becoming clearer. Saylor‚Äôs vision for Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset aligns with growing calls for governments and institutions to embrace digital assets. Whether the US will heed these calls remains uncertain, but the momentum behind Bitcoin adoption is undeniably gaining strength. With the inauguration of Donald Trump and Saylor‚Äôs cryptic hint of a ‚Äúdifferent tomorrow,‚Äù the stage is set for potential shifts in Bitcoin adoption and regulatory approaches. As MicroStrategy leads the charge, the question remains: will others follow suit, or will the US risk falling behind in the race to embrace the future of finance? Bitcoin Nears Monthly Highs as Traders Anticipate Price Discovery and Record-Breaking Moves In related news, Bitcoin is on the verge of hitting new monthly highs, closing in on a pivotal price level as market participants prepare for the next phase of price discovery. On Jan. 19, BTC/USD approached $105,500 on Bitstamp, fueled by bullish sentiment across the cryptocurrency landscape. Data from TradingView highlighted Bitcoin‚Äôs robust performance, with the cryptocurrency gaining 12% month-to-date. This bullish momentum has positioned Bitcoin as a favorite for long positions, just before the inauguration of US President-elect Donald Trump‚Äîa moment that has generated renewed interest in the crypto space. Adding to the excitement is the rise of Trump‚Äôs own meme coin, OFFICIAL TRUMP (TRUMP), which has surpassed an $11 billion market capitalization. This milestone has placed it among the top 20 cryptocurrencies, showcasing a broader positive sentiment for digital assets. Market experts and analysts are increasingly optimistic about Bitcoin‚Äôs trajectory. Prominent trader Pentoshi predicted an imminent return to Bitcoin‚Äôs all-time high, stating on X, ‚Äú$BTC ATH incoming pretty soon imo.‚Äù Another influential voice, Moataz Elsayed, known as Eljaboom, described Bitcoin‚Äôs current price movement as entering the ‚Äúbelief phase‚Äù of its cycle. Drawing comparisons between BTC‚Äôs present trajectory and its behavior during the last bull run, Eljaboom forecasted a dramatic price target of $150,000 this cycle. While the market is brimming with optimism, analysts are also emphasizing the importance of maintaining critical support levels. Daan Crypto Trades, a popular crypto trader, pointed to Bitcoin‚Äôs recent retest of the prior yearly high as a crucial area to watch. ‚Äú$BTC Clean retest of the prior yearly high,‚Äù he noted, adding that the $102,700 level must hold to keep the momentum alive for a move toward all-time highs next week. Amid widespread bullish sentiment, traders are setting ambitious short-term targets for Bitcoin. One of the most discussed predictions comes from Nunya Bizniz, who identified a target of $122,000 by early February. This projection aligns with a breakout from an upward trend line observed in Bitcoin‚Äôs daily price chart. Another notable analysis from Keith Alan, co-founder of Material Indicators, highlighted the significance of a cup-and-handle pattern on Bitcoin‚Äôs weekly chart. According to Alan, this pattern points to a $122,000 target, supported by key milestones such as: Double Top Resistance at $108,000 Psychological Resistance at $110,000 ‚ÄúBitcoin has reclaimed the key moving averages and is grinding back toward ATH Territory,‚Äù Alan reported on Jan. 17. Market Outlook: A Break into Price Discovery As Bitcoin flirts with its previous highs, the market is abuzz with speculation about its next move. With traders like Pentoshi, Eljaboom, and Keith Alan projecting new records in the near term, the focus has shifted to Bitcoin‚Äôs ability to sustain its upward momentum and break into price discovery territory. The convergence of multiple bullish indicators and high-profile endorsements further solidifies the narrative of a potentially explosive price rally. Should Bitcoin surpass its current resistance zones, the journey toward $150,000 could become a defining moment in this market cycle. Bitcoin‚Äôs recent performance reflects growing confidence among traders and institutional players alike. The upcoming inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, coupled with the surging popularity of crypto-related assets like the OFFICIAL TRUMP meme coin, adds another layer of intrigue to Bitcoin‚Äôs market dynamics.

A crypto price surge is unfolding as crypto whales make bold moves, fueling major gains for XRP, Rollblock (RLBK) , and XLM. XRP recently hit $2.49 its highest since 2018 after whales scooped up 679.1 million tokens worth $1.66 billion in just three weeks. Meanwhile, Rollblock , a groundbreaking GambleFi protocol, has already sold over 52 million tokens in its presale. XLM is also seeing impressive traction. These whale activities could be the spark for the next big breakout‚Äîare you watching closely? Rolling the dice: Why Crypto Whales Are Betting Big On Rollblock Rollblock is shaking up the GambleFi space, and it‚Äôs no wonder crypto whales are taking notice. Bridging the gap between decentralized and centralized gaming, this innovative platform offers the best of both worlds‚Äîseamless transactions and robust gameplay. With the online gambling industry worth billions, Rollblock‚Äôs vision is clear: redefine how players interact with games, rewards, and security. It‚Äôs no surprise this has sparked a crypto price surge around its token, RBLK. RBLK isn‚Äôt just another token. Designed to reward player activity, it transforms loyalty into real value. Imagine playing your favorite game and earning tokens for it‚Äîtokens that can be reinvested or held for potential gains. Crypto whales love utility like this. It drives engagement and retention.

XRP Whales Are Diving In: Here‚Äôs Why It‚Äôs Happening XRP has recently surged to $2.83, its highest since early 2018, and crypto whales are playing a big role here. Whales holding between 1 million and 10 million XRP tokens are steadily accumulating, with a significant increase in volume. Speculation around a potential XRP ETF listing in the US, along with optimism surrounding President-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs inauguration, fuels investor interest. Crypto whales clearly see the potential as they capitalize on this momentum. Experts suggest that as Bitcoin‚Äôs price rises, investors may look to shift capital into altcoins like XRP, further driving the crypto whale accumulation. With XRP‚Äôs price increase, the positive sentiment is contagious, and crypto whales are eager to ride the wave. Crypto Whales Are Making Moves On XLM And Here‚Äôs The Catch XLM is subtly attracting the attention of cryptocurrency whales, with factors outside price influencing their interest. Stellar has established a reputation for efficiency and scalability due to its rapid transactions and minimal fees. Cryptocurrency whales are investing because of their tangible uses, particularly in cross-border payments, where XLM may surpass its competitors. Its decentralized structure, together with its distinctive consensus mechanism, makes it safe and energy-efficient, satisfying the requirements of substantial investors. As an increasing number of enterprises and financial organizations investigate Stellar‚Äôs functionalities, cryptocurrency investors are actively acquiring assets, certain of its long-term development prospects. It seems they possess information that eludes us! Conclusion As crypto whales continue to accumulate XRP and XLM, Rollblock‚Äôs unique GambleFi protocol offers something truly groundbreaking. With its seamless blend of decentralized and centralized gaming, enhanced player rewards, and robust security, Rollblock is well-positioned for long-term success.

MELANIA also faced some scrutiny over its token distribution and rushed development, as 90% of its supply is reportedly held in a single wallet. Meanwhile, TRUMP, the Solana-based meme coin, spurred a lot of activity on the blockchain. It also boosted Solana‚Äôs native asset, SOL, and elevated NFT collections like Mad Lads. Additionally, the broader crypto market saw increased interest after decent gains in Solana-based tokens and a resurgence of Trump‚Äôs Digital Trading Cards. Melania Trump Launches Meme Coin The crypto world was shaken on Jan. 19 after Melania Trump, the incoming First Lady of the United States, launched her self-titled meme coin, MELANIA . The crypto reached a staggering $6 billion market cap in just two hours of its debut. This sudden rise led to a dramatic shift in the market as Donald Trump‚Äôs own meme coin, TRUMP, experienced a large drop in value. The TRUMP token‚Äôs market cap plummeted by $5 billion, while its price fell 30+% to $45.9 in just 40 minutes, according to CoinMarketCap data. TRUMP‚Äôs price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Melania Trump announced the launch of her token through a social media post , which was also shared by her husband. Data from DEXScreener revealed that more than 45,000 wallets participated in buying the token, which quickly surged to a market cap of $6.14 billion. The website promoting MELANIA stated that the token was created to foster ‚Äúsupport‚Äù and ‚Äúengagement‚Äù rather than being positioned as an investment opportunity. According to the website , the token distribution includes allocations of 35% to the team, 20% each to treasury and community, 15% to the public, and 10% for liquidity. However, blockchain analytics platform Bubblemaps contradicted these claims by revealing that almost 90% of the token‚Äôs supply is held in a single wallet. This raised some serious concerns about transparency and the token‚Äôs true distribution. Coinbase executive Conor Grogan commented that while MELANIA‚Äôs launch does not look to be a rug pull, it seems to have been handled by a less organized team compared to the TRUMP token, which showed signs of professional market-making. Grogan speculated that MELANIA might have been managed by a new team with possibly inexperienced developers . More scrutiny of MELANIA‚Äôs launch uncovered even more potential red flags. The creator wallet was reportedly funded through a transaction on Solana‚Äôs meme coin launchpad pump.fun. Additionally, the website hosting the token‚Äôs details, ‚Äúmelaniameme.com,‚Äù was registered only a day before the launch and did not have key cybersecurity measures. Crypto developer ‚Äúcygaar‚Äù pointed out that the site seems quite rushed with substandard front-end coding. MKT World LLC, a company that was established by Melania Trump in 2021 and sharing an address with the Trump International Golf Club, holds the intellectual property rights to the website. Google Searches Surge Amid TRUMP Meme Coin Hype The launch of President-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs meme coin, TRUMP, also drove search volumes for terms like ‚Äú buy crypto ‚Äù and ‚Äú buy Solana ‚Äù to record highs. Data from Google Trends shows that both terms reached a perfect score of 100, indicating peak search interest. Other crypto-related terms, like ‚ÄúCoinbase‚Äù and ‚Äúcrypto app,‚Äù also saw a sharp increase in search activity as part of¬†the buzz surrounding the current meme coin frenzy. Google searches for ‚Äòbuy Solana‚Äô (Source: Google Trends ) TRUMP is a Solana-based meme coin that very quickly captured headlines and divided opinions in the crypto community. The meme coin was initially met with a lot of skepticism due to the existence of numerous knock-off Trump-themed tokens, but the authenticity of the project was confirmed by members of Trump‚Äôs team after a promotional post by the president-elect on X. Trump declared the launch of his ‚ÄúOfficial Trump Meme‚Äù as a celebration of his vision and invited supporters to join his community. This endorsement sent the token‚Äôs price soaring to $67 and a fully diluted valuation of approximately $67 billion. The token‚Äôs meteoric rise had a ripple effect on the broader market as well, especially on Solana‚Äôs native asset, SOL . The altcoin surged to highs and caused it to peak at $270 per coin, boosted by the attention drawn to the Solana ecosystem by TRUMP‚Äôs success. At press time, the price of the altcoin stabilized around $239. Arthur Hayes, market analyst and co-founder of BitMEX, predicts that TRUMP could achieve a fully diluted valuation of $100 billion by the time of the inauguration on Monday. Hayes also suggested that meme coins like TRUMP could potentially bring political accountability onto the blockchain. He also promised to release an essay exploring this concept even more. TRUMP Meme Coin Boosts Solana and Mad Lads NFTs The Solana blockchain is experiencing a big surge in activity, driven by the launch of the TRUMP meme coin and a rally in its native asset, SOL. The increased attention even propelled the NFT collection Mad Lads to the 8th spot among the most valuable NFTs by floor market cap. With a market cap of close to $151 million and a floor price of $15,177, the collection recorded $472,748 in trading volume from 27 sales in the past 24 hours. This was still slightly less than the NFT collection‚Äôs performance from the day before. Mad Labs was created by Armani Ferrante and Tristan Yver of Backpack Exchange, and it¬†blends anime-style art with themes inspired by Peaky Blinders. Top NTF rankings (Source: NFT Price Floor ) The broader Solana NFT market also grew by about 15% on Jan. 19, with its total market cap reaching $714 million and trading volume hitting $3.39 million. Other collections, like Claynosaurz and Solana Monkey Business , also saw some impressive gains. Claynosaurz hit a floor price of $4,882, up 13.8%, with a market cap of $48.8 million, while Solana Monkey Business has a floor price of $7,956, which is a 7.1% increase and a market cap of $39.7 million. Solana-based tokens mirrored this upward trend on Jan. 19. Jupiter‚Äôs token, JUP , rose 33%, while Raydium‚Äôs token, RAY , climbed 10%. Despite their impressive gains the day before, both of these tokens saw double digit losses at press time. The impact of the TRUMP meme coin extended beyond Solana by reigniting interest in Trump‚Äôs Digital Trading Cards on the Polygon blockchain. The first collection traded at a floor price of $936.91 on Jan. 19, up 12%, with a market cap of $93.5 million and a trading volume of $2.44 million. The second collection also gained some traction, with its floor price rising 10% to $213, supported by 2,133 sales, a market cap of $22.6 million, and a trading volume of $940,000.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-20 05:37:27

Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal explained this observation in an X post on January 2, illustrating why XRP is still favored by newcomers in the crypto space. Despite the lengthy court battles, XRP has cemented its place as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. XRP is now valued at $180 billion, based on data from CoinMarketCap, and as of January 3rd, it has a 24-hour trading volume of $18 billion. Pal‚Äôs insights point to a unique attribute‚Äîits ability to resonate with ‚Äúnormies,‚Äù or average retail investors entering the volatile crypto space. Raoul Pal‚Äôs Take on XRP‚Äôs Unique Appeal In his recent critique of the growing AI agent craze in crypto, Pal contrasted the hype surrounding AI agents with XRP‚Äôs steady appeal. He dismissed the AI narrative as a short-lived fad driven by thrill-seeking market players, stating, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll come in and buy XRP anyway.‚Äù Source: X Pal attributes XRP‚Äôs enduring popularity to its simplicity, affordability, and association with Ripple, a reputable payments firm. Low transaction fees and a user-friendly approach make XRP an attractive entry point for those new to crypto, according to industry analysis. A ‚ÄúCult-Like‚Äù Following XRP‚Äôs loyal user base is another factor contributing to its mass appeal. In an August 2024 video, Pal described XRP‚Äôs community as having a ‚Äúcult-like‚Äù following, drawn to the token‚Äôs reliability and its role in cross-border payments. This support persisted even during XRP‚Äôs legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which led to temporary delistings from major exchanges like Coinbase. Despite this setback, XRP staged an impressive comeback. Between November and December 2024, XRP soared 475% , outperforming most other cryptocurrencies. The rally followed Donald Trump‚Äôs election victory, with market participants speculating on regulatory clarity for XRP under a new administration. AI Agents vs. XRP: Market Sentiment While XRP thrives on its simplicity and proven utility, the rise of AI agents has introduced a new layer of complexity to the crypto space. These unsupervised software use artificial intelligence to perform blockchain operations such as portfolio management and tokenized trade. However, Pal raised his eyebrows about their sustainability, claiming it to be a ‚Äúthrill-seeker‚Äôs game.‚Äù Logical barriers and the scarcity of applications also provoked questions regarding AI agent sustainability. XRP, on the other hand, remains to provide value-adding services, thus should not be only considered a speculative investment. The recent performance shows why XRP remains relevant in the portfolio of retail investors. Although extraneous fads such as AI agents may serve to mesmerize the general public temporarily, XRP is the only digital currency consistently demonstrating stable growth and constantly expanding its circle of recognition among traders.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,XRP|BUSINESS|MARKET|EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-20 05:59:58

The lawsuit filed Friday is one of the latest enforcement actions under outgoing SEC Chairman Gary Gensler. The SEC‚Äôs lawsuit focuses on three Helium-related tokens: Helium Network Token (HNT), Helium Mobile Token (MOBILE), and Helium IoT Network Token (IoT). The agency alleges that these tokens were sold as unregistered securities and violated federal securities laws. Additionally, the SEC accuses Nova Labs of misleading investors about partnerships with leading companies such as Nestl√©, Lime, and Salesforce. While Nova Labs claims that these companies used the Helium network, the SEC alleges that these companies were neither customers nor active users. The lawsuit states that both Nestl√© and Lime sent cease and desist letters to Nova Labs after learning of the allegations. The SEC is seeking civil penalties and a ban on Nova Labs from purchasing, offering, or selling any crypto assets that are considered securities. Related News: Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) Responds to ""CZ Coin"" Memecoin Rumors Helium founder Amir Haleem responded defiantly to the lawsuit in a post on X (formerly Twitter) today, accusing the SEC of waging a ‚Äúfailed war on crypto companies in the US.‚Äù Haleem also addressed the misleading partnership claims, saying, ‚ÄúWe have addressed this issue in the past and have worked with every company named in the complaint on Helium.‚Äù Haleem added that he was reviewing Nova Labs‚Äô practices, and had previously said in a statement that the company would implement a more rigorous logo approval process to avoid misunderstandings in the future. Haleem also viewed the case as a broader threat to decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePINs), arguing that classifying Helium hotspots as securities could endanger the entire DePIN industry. Haleem concluded his remarks by saying: ‚ÄúWe will vigorously defend ourselves and continue to uphold Gensler SEC‚Äôs record of miserable losses and outright lies. Not just for us, but for all DePIN projects. ‚ÄúHaving Helium hotspots as securities would endanger all DePINs. We will not allow that to happen.‚Äù *This is not investment advice.

This transaction, flagged by blockchain analytics firm Whale Alert, has triggered a wave of speculation within the cryptocurrency community regarding its potential implications for the market. The Mechanics of Whale Movements Large-scale cryptocurrency transfers to exchanges often hint at impending market activity. When assets are deposited on exchanges like Binance, it‚Äôs typically interpreted as preparation for liquidation. Conversely, withdrawals to private wallets might signal accumulation or long-term holding strategies. The transfer of such a substantial amount of DOGE raises questions about the holder‚Äôs intentions. Could it be a ‚Äúwhale‚Äù‚Äîa term for individuals or entities holding significant quantities of cryptocurrency‚Äîplanning to capitalize on recent price movements? Or is this a strategic move for other financial maneuvers, such as portfolio diversification or liquidity needs? A Trend of Significant Transfers This transaction is not an isolated event. Over the past 48 hours, Dogecoin has seen a flurry of high-value movements- two transfers totaling over 51.9 million DOGE ($21.3 million) was shifted from Robinhood to Coinbase, hinting at potential trading or liquidity adjustments. Likewise, another substantial transfer of 80.4 million DOGE ($33.1 million) was moved from Robinhood to an unidentified wallet, suggesting possible long-term holding intentions. Even larger movements were recorded, with 400 million DOGE ($154.3 million) and 200 million DOGE ($77.3 million) exchanged between anonymous wallets. These transactions underscore heightened activity surrounding Dogecoin, a trend that often precedes price volatility. Dogecoin‚Äôs Recent Price Action Despite the excitement around these transfers, Dogecoin‚Äôs price has experienced a mixed trajectory. Over the past 24 hours, DOGE has dropped by 4.37%, likely driven by market profit-taking following a broader rally in meme coins. However, the cryptocurrency remains up 15.73% over the past week, showcasing its resilience amidst market turbulence. This price behavior aligns with a broader trend in the cryptocurrency market, where meme coins frequently experience sharp spikes followed by equally rapid corrections as traders seek to lock in profits.

The community is left to speculate whether the whales are cashing out. The transfer to Binance could indicate a sell-off, potentially placing downward pressure on DOGE‚Äôs price. Alternatively, such movements reflect strategic reallocations by long-term holders confident in Dogecoin‚Äôs future potential. The broader implications of these transactions remain uncertain, but they remind us of whales‚Äô significant influence in the cryptocurrency market. A Dynamic Market Landscape Dogecoin , often considered a meme coin, continues to capture the spotlight with its massive transactions and active trading patterns. While recent price dips may concern some investors, the broader trend of large-scale movements suggests ongoing interest and engagement from major players. As the market watches for the next move, one thing is certain: the Dogecoin story is far from over, and its loyal community remains as engaged as ever in deciphering its twists and turns.

The largest cryptocurrency touched $109,333 on Binance. Trump mentioned the asset's record performance in a Sunday speech alongside gains in the broader U.S. stock market. ""Since the election, the stock market has surged and small business optimism has soared a record 41 points to a 39-year high. Bitcoin has shattered one record high after another,"" Trump said. BTC reversed losses from earlier in the day when it fell to nearly $100,000 from a high over $102,000 on Sunday as first lady Melania Trump issued a memecoin, drawing liquidity away from major assets. Trump has been vocal about his support for cryptocurrencies during his campaign. Promises like making the U.S. the ""crypto capital of the planet"" and creating a ""strategic national bitcoin reserve"" have fueled investor optimism. ""Bitcoin reached $108K while other cryptocurrencies have rapidly pumped on the eve of the US presidential inauguration, with hopes that new policies and regulators will send the price of BTC much further this year as the US economy continues to show strength in the long term,"" Ben El-Baz, Managing Director of HashKey Global, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. ""The forward momentum has been further accelerated by the launch of the TRUMP and MELANIA memecoins which have attracted more retail users, and hopes that Trump will prioritize and reaffirm his commitment to the crypto industry."" ""Designating crypto as a national priority and launching TRUMP coin over the past few days have been strong, positive signals. As the main bellwether for the industry, Bitcoin's surge was expected and is likely to continue through the week,"" Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE, said in a Telegram message. Year-end bitcoin targets range from $185,000 to as high as $250,000, as CoinDesk previously reported . Meanwhile, bitcoin dominance has started to trend higher and is now approaching 60%, the highest level since Dec. 20.

Over the day, the coin gained 220% with an FDV of $62 billion. Donald Trump's Coin Price and Growth At the time of writing, the asset is trading at $61,9 with a market capitalization of $12.1 billion. TRUMP has already climbed to the 16th position in the ranking of the largest cryptocurrencies, ahead of TON and SHIB. The daily trading volume has reached almost $1 billion. The excitement around TRUMP occurs against the background of relative stagnation in the rest of the market of digital assets. However, a surge of activity in the Solana network ensured SOL's growth to new historical highs - the coin is now trading at peak values around $286. Centralized exchanges including Binance, Bybit, HTX, Gate and Bitget have all floated the token. DEX on Solana are also recording record highs. Daily trading volume on the network holds at $21 billion for the second day in a row. TRUMP's Coin Tokenomics: Emission and Allocation The available supply on launch day was 200 million TRUMP for a total issuance of 1 billion coins. According to the project's website, the tokens are planned to be unlocked gradually over three years. A total of 100 million TRUMP is earmarked for public distribution, with another 100 million coins to provide liquidity. The remaining 800 million TRUMP are earmarked for ‚Äúcreators‚Äù and CIC Digital, a company associated with Trump's NFT project. The first unlock is scheduled to take place in three months. Crypto investor and host of The Wolf Of All Streets podcast Scott Melker said Trump's meme coin is a ‚Äúsignificant benefit‚Äù for cryptocurrency but a ‚Äúdetriment to humanity.‚Äù $TRUMP First take.

If the interest in the figure of Donald Trump remains high, the volatility of the projects will be significant. Positive news background raises the price, while any negative event can sharply collapse the rates. It is recommended not to ‚Äúbuy on highs‚Äù and not follow the global trends of the crypto market. Professional traders advise using risk management and diversification, because a sudden ‚Äúdump‚Äù can completely nullify the deposit of an unprepared investor. The future of Trump's coin Arkham Intelligence suggested that if the firms CIC Digital and Fight Fight Fight, which together own 80% of the TRUMP issue, are actually owned by the president-elect, then his fortune has multiplied several times over.

In response to criticism and concerns from the community, crypto-enthusiast Eric Scott stated that 80% of the supply in the hands of a politician makes TRUMP one of the ‚Äúsafest coins‚Äù to hold.

Regardless of the short-term correction, Bitcoin price today is up No data found for bitcoin on 49 minutes ago% and hit a new all-time high (ATH) of $110,000.

Polymarket data shows that the odds of a strategic Bitcoin reserve approval have shot up from 37% to 59% in just a few minutes. Will Trump create Bitcoin reserve in first 100 days? Why Bitcoin Price Today Is Up 8% as BTC Hits New ATH? Bitcoin price today set up a new ATH of $110,000 and trades at No data found for bitcoin on 49 minutes ago after shooting up No data found for bitcoin on 49 minutes ago%. This spike in buying pressure could be attributed to investors pulling out of the TRUMP coin and reinvesting profits into a more risk-averse asset like Bitcoin. Moreover, the long-term outlook of BTC remains bullish, with higher highs and higher lows on the daily and weekly charts, adding credence to the recent spike in buying pressure and a new ATH. The second reason for this uptrend could be the Presideent-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs inauguration, which is scheduled to take place today. Investors may have considered the recent launch of a meme coin on Solana as a show of Trump‚Äôs support for the crypto space. Additionally, it wouldn‚Äôt be surprising that capital is rotating back into BTC in anticipation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve.

Crypto experts and industry leaders raise concerns over politicians‚Äô unfair market advantage, highlighting the lack of regulatory clarity. Pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton underscored the priority of memecoin regulation over other concerns, including SAB 121 legislation. Trump‚Äôs surprise launch of the memecoin ahead of his presidential inauguration has ignited a heated discussion about the pressing need for clearer regulations in the crypto space. XRP Lawyer John Deaton Pushes for Urgent Memecoin Regulation In a recent X post , John Deaton stressed the urgency in implementing memecoin regulations prompted by the frenzy surrounding Trump‚Äôs memecoin launch. Deaton stated that he previously believed SAB 121 stablecoin legislation , CFTC oversight, and tax reform were the immediate areas requiring attention from the Trump administration and Congress. Correcting his earlier stance, he wrote, ‚ÄúI stand corrected: it‚Äôs Meme Coin Regulation.‚Äù Backlash Grows Over Memecoin Frenzy Notably, Nic Carter, who calls himself a devoted Trump supporter, expressed his disagreement with Trump‚Äôs memecoin launch. Calling the move unreasonable, Nic Carter stated, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre plumbing new depths of idiocy with the memecoin launch.‚Äù Another significant personality who urged action for memecoin regulation is the US representative Ro Khanna. He recommended banning elected officials from owning highly speculative memecoins. Reflecting on the TRUMP memecoin launch , Khanna wrote: Elected officials must be barred from having meme coins by law. Meme coins are highly speculative and like gambling must be regulated by the SEC. They are neither neutral money (not controlled by insiders) nor platforms for innovation. Trump‚Äôs Memecoin Promotion Impacts XRP Lawsuit Deaton‚Äôs push for memecoin regulations follows concerns raised by XRP advocate Bill Morgan about the potential TRUMP‚Äôs impact on XRP lawsuit . According to Morgan, the incoming President‚Äôs unprecedented launch of the token emphasizes the need for clear crypto guidelines. With XRP lawyer like Deaton and Morgan expressing concerns over the TRUMP token launch, its impact extends beyond the crypto market. As the situation unfolds, it is clear that the urge for clear regulations has never been more pressing.

This idea could change the way politics and cryptocurrency interact. But how would it work, and what does it mean for the future of money? Trump‚Äôs $59 Billion Crypto Fortune Balaji Srinivasan suggests that Trump‚Äôs net worth could be redefined if he shifts most of his wealth into cryptocurrency. Currently valued at $59 billion, Trump could, in theory, hold 90% of his fortune in crypto, just as many early Bitcoin and Ethereum investors did. FIRST CRYPTO PRESIDENT Overnight, the vast majority of the net worth ($59B) of the next President of the United States is now held in cryptocurrency. This will hold true even with a 90% drop. What are the implications? 1) First, President Trump just went from crypto being‚Ä¶ https://t.co/yh3bSytZx4 ‚Äî Balaji (@balajis) January 19, 2025 Srinivasan warns that this isn‚Äôt just a U.S. phenomenon. As fiat currencies lose their value over time, millions across the globe will likely face similar transitions to crypto wealth. Politicians, celebrities, and influencers worldwide watch this change closely. The future of money might be digital, and Trump‚Äôs crypto journey could be the first of its kind on the global stage. Can TRUMP Token Will Survive? The big question is whether the TRUMP token will retain its value. History has shown that celebrity-backed coins tend to fall quickly. However, Trump is no ordinary celebrity. Trump has over 100 million followers and continues to receive constant media attentio Unlike other celebrity-backed tokens that failed to keep their value, the TRUMP token could benefit from Trump‚Äôs powerful influence, provided it manages to keep the public‚Äôs interest. Airdrop Proposal: $100 per Voter? One of the most eye-catching elements of Srinivasan‚Äôs proposal is the potential airdrop of TRUMP tokens to all 77 million Trump voters. If Trump were to give $100 worth of TRUMP to each supporter, it would cost him roughly $7.7 billion. While this amount might seem large, it could make sense given the rapid growth of the TRUMP token‚Äôs value. By offering free tokens, Trump could not only gain more support but also strengthen his base, turning loyal voters into even more dedicated followers. Legal and Ethical Considerations Of course, there are some legal and ethical concerns that could arise from such a move. While it‚Äôs common for politicians to ask for donations, no politician has attempted to send an airdrop of cryptocurrency to millions of people. Srinivasan believes Trump could overcome these challenges by presenting the airdrop as a personal, voluntary exchange.",News,EN,0,0,AIRDROP|EXCHANGE|MINING|REGULATION|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-20 07:37:47

This cryptocurrency niche, where projects ride on narrative, hype, and community support rather than the utility anchor for traditional crypto projects, has become a favorite investment niche for crypto investors. Following the recent record-breaking move of Bitcoin above $100,000 and other favorable crypto considerations globally, the Meme coin market is set for another long ride in green. One of the Meme coins tipped to be a goldmine in 2025 is Chill Drone ( $CHONE ). A uniquely positioned meme coin with a narrative that ticks every box of its predecessors like $DOGE and $SHIB.

Chill Drone goes beyond just a meme coin to a movement that hopes to inject a new lifestyle into the crypto market, where it creates a strong community of people separated from the pressure and endless grind of domination. It is a community of holders embracing relaxation, balance, tranquility, creativity, humor, and fun. What Makes $CHONE Appealing? Dogecoin and Shiba Inu had a good narrative, humor, community, and shareability in common, which contributed to their widespread success. The case is not entirely different with Chill Drone, as it shares all of these features, which positions it for similar success. Top of the list of $CHONE‚Äôs unique appeal is its meme-worthy vibes. Social media virality is a big part of successful meme coins. Chill Drone‚Äôs quirky drone character with half-open eyes and a serene philosophy practically markets itself. Its relatable philosophy is also an appealing factor. ‚ÄúChill out‚Äù is just the statement a lot of people want to hear in a fast-paced and chaotic world. High relatability makes it easier for virality in the world of meme coins. $CHONE isn‚Äôt screaming ‚Äúto the moon,‚Äù rather it‚Äôs whispering ‚ÄúEnjoy the ride.‚Äù $CHONE‚Äôs young presence in a crypto market tipped to be highly favored under the incoming US government makes it a good investment consideration. Early investors will have the opportunity to ride the wave before it goes mainstream. The meme coin market thrives on stories (narratives), and Chill Drone has one of the best narratives in the market right now.

Economic Events Jan. 20 to 24 President-elect Donald Trump will be sworn into office on Monday, but markets may have already factored this in. However, the signing of executive orders may come quickly, inducing further market volatility. Over the weekend, Trump launched his own memecoin (TRUMP), which surged to over $70 billion in fully diluted valuation in a matter of hours before dumping 50% in a massive market crash.

On Saturday, Donald Trump‚Äôs official token, TRUMP, was issued on the Solana blockchain, which led to an uptick in trading volumes over the weekend. Between Saturday and Sunday, the network generated fees of over $35 million and revenue of at least $14 million, DeFiLlama data shows. This volume originated from some 6 million active addresses. These fees are more than double of Nov. 22 levels of nearly $14 million, when several AI Agent tokens populated the network and led to a trading frenzy. Such fees are remarkably high for a low-cost blockchain, when transactions typically take fractions of a cent to settle. The TRUMP token attracted over $3 billion in trading volumes on Saturday and Sunday, with other ecosystem plays, such as Jupiter‚Äôs JUP, seeing heightened interest from traders. The choice of Solana as an issuance network, in turn, bumped demand and sentiment for SOL tokens, as reported by CoinDesk . SOL trading volumes have rocketed from Thursday‚Äôs $3 billion to over $26 billion in the past 24 hours, with Saturday‚Äôs moves bringing weekly gains to over 46%. SOL has surged nearly 3,000% from its three-year low of $9 back in December 2022 when the implosion of crypto exchange FTX and prominent Solana backer Sam Bankman-Fried, dented sentiment for the network. Late Sunday, First Lady Melania Trump launched her own memecoin in a move that sent TRUMP spiraling down 50% at one point. The high volumes and network requests briefly caused ecosystem applications Jito and Phantom to encounter delays in Asian morning hours, though these were quickly rectified.

Authorities in Jeju Island, South Korea ‚Äòs largest island, have arrested six Chinese nationals for allegedly stealing 1 billion won (nearly $690,000) during Tether ( USDT ) transaction at a hotel on Jan. 16, Maeil Business Newspaper reports , citing Jeju Western Police. The group is accused of attacking the crypto dealer ‚Äî known just as A ‚Äî and taking the cash. The suspects, including a man in his 40s ‚Äî called B ‚Äî, say they‚Äôre the real victims. Police said the group accused A of ‚Äúmaking Tether stablecoins disappear‚Äù during the transaction. The authorities allege that the group attacked the A person and took the cash meant for the exchange. Two suspects were arrested at the hotel, the report reads, adding that three others were caught at Jeju International Airport, and one was arrested at another currency exchange. Police recovered 369 million won in cash from the suspects but are still tracking the rest.

They claim they originally planned to exchange Korean won for Chinese currency but were convinced to use virtual currency instead. Investigators believe the group always intended to use Tether and think they moved the stablecoins out of the wallet during the exchange before attacking A to steal the funds. Meanwhile, South Korea‚Äôs financial regulator, the Financial Services Commission, has officially started working on the second phase of its crypto rules to boost user protection. Kim So-young, Vice Chairman of the FSC, said the move to push ahead with phase two comes as the global crypto market faces ‚Äúrapid changes with mixed feelings of optimism and uncertainty.‚Äù The new set of rules will reportedly cover such areas as stablecoins , crypto exchanges, and business entry regulations, though detail are yet to be revealed.

Chart Pattern Suggests Yes,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/will-dogecoin-skyrocket-soon-chart-pattern-yes/,"A key technical development on the Dogecoin (DOGE/USD) chart could hint at a bullish move if current support levels hold, according to crypto market analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA). After roughly a month in a downward-sloping pattern, DOGE appears to be rebounding off the former resistance line of this channel‚Äîan event that often garners attention among traders looking for an upswing. Dogecoin Price Ready To Skyrocket? On Sunday (Jan 19), Kevin noted that Dogecoin had been ‚Äútrading in a falling channel for over a month‚Äù and was ‚Äúcurrently back testing‚Äù the channel‚Äôs upper boundary. He emphasized that it was crucial for DOGE ‚Äúto hold this and bounce,‚Äù noting that failure to do so might force a ‚Äúreassessment‚Äù of the chart. Thus far, it seems the cryptocurrency is managing to defend its newfound support. DOGE briefly dipped to about $0.345 before closing two deep wick four-hour candles back above the trend line. Kevin pointed out this ‚Äúnice bounce off the retest‚Äù and its alignment with key four-hour moving averages, suggesting the potential for higher prices. Related Reading: Dogecoin‚Äôs Bullish Push Gains Steam, A Retest To $0.4 Ahead At press time, Dogecoin sits around the $0.38‚Äì$0.39 level, showing resilience at its former resistance-turned-support. Kevin noted: ‚ÄúDogecoin is catching a nice bounce off the retest of the falling channel I have been tracking along with its key 4HR moving averages. Very nice.‚Äù Despite Dogecoin‚Äôs promising technical setup, Kevin stressed that altcoins remain heavily dependent on Bitcoin‚Äôs direction and market dominance. He referred to the ongoing crypto cycle, asserting that ‚Äúwe have never been in an altseason‚Äù so far in this bull run. According to Kevin, altcoins will not ‚Äúdurably outperform the King‚Äù unless BTC dominance falls below the 54.51% threshold and USDT dominance sinks beneath 3.7%. Related Reading: Dogecoin Leads The Pack As Dog-Themed Coins Rally ‚Äì ‚ÄúTrump Effect‚Äù Sparks Excitement He also observed that Bitcoin dominance was nearing 59%, effectively ‚Äúattacking the macro golden pocket‚Äù and potentially threatening altcoin performance. If BTC reestablishes its lead above these critical dominance levels, Kevin believes the short-term outlook for most altcoins‚ÄîDogecoin included‚Äîmay remain constrained, even if their individual charts look constructive. Another factor adding turbulence to the crypto market is the recent memecoin launch by incoming US President Donald Trump. Kevin lamented that, in his view, the crypto market had been ‚Äúthe healthiest‚Äù it had looked in four years‚Äîhighlighting how higher-quality utility coins were gaining traction and how investors seemed to be ‚Äúfleeing to quality left and right.‚Äù However, he claims that ‚Äúin just 36 hours,‚Äù those close to Trump released a memecoin that derailed this dynamic, sparking renewed meme coin speculation and pulling many solid projects down by double-digit percentages. Despite describing this frenzy as a ‚Äútemporary derailment,‚Äù Kevin believes the situation will eventually stabilize: ‚ÄúIt may take a few weeks, but I still think we‚Äôre in a very good spot.‚Äù For Dogecoin, the immediate signal to watch is whether it can continue holding above its retested channel line. A decisive bounce above the $0.40-$0.41 region could bolster the bullish case, especially if broader market conditions remain supportive. On the other hand, any surge in Bitcoin dominance‚Äîand the possible return of heightened meme coin mania‚Äîmay introduce fresh headwinds. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.38.

The flagship coin signaled the onset of a fresh parabolic rally fueled by rising demand from institutional investors, and soon nation-states. Following the sudden Bitcoin price surge after retesting the support level around $100k, more than $264 million was liquidated from the BTC‚Äôs leveraged market in the last 24 hours, with the majority involving long traders. The altcoin industry followed in similar volatility, thus resulting in $1.25 billion in forced liquidations, with over $911 million involving long traders. Rising Demand for Bitcoin by Whale Investors Bitcoin price has enjoyed robust support from institutional investors seeking to hedge against global inflation and significant uncertainty in macroeconomics. For instance, the US spot BTC ETFs have registered exponential growth in the net cash inflow since the yearly calendar flipped three weeks ago. According to the latest market data, the US spot BTC ETFs have registered a net cash inflow of over $1.5 billion year-to-date. As a result, the US spot BTC ETFs have registered a cumulative total net inflow of $38 billion and currently have a total net assets of $120.95 billion.

This marks a new all-time high (ATH) for the flagship cryptocurrency, eclipsing its previous record of $108,000 set in December 2024. According to CoinMarketCap data , Bitcoin‚Äôs price touched $109,036 at 6:55 a.m. UTC, only to retreat below $108,000 minutes later. As of now, Bitcoin is trading at $107,293, up 3% in the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency boasts a market capitalization of $2.14 trillion, reflecting a remarkable 25% surge over the last seven days. Its 24-hour trading volume has also skyrocketed by 120%, reaching an impressive $108 billion. This historic milestone comes as the global financial markets closely monitor Trump‚Äôs upcoming inauguration at 4:00 p.m. UTC. The event has proven to be a powerful catalyst for Bitcoin, which first breached the $100,000 mark in December 2024 following Trump‚Äôs electoral victory. Bitcoin Breaks Records Market analysts point to growing optimism within the crypto community as a key driver of Bitcoin‚Äôs meteoric rise. Trump‚Äôs administration has consistently signaled a favorable stance toward cryptocurrencies, with campaign promises including crypto deregulation and a potential strategic Bitcoin reserve . These plans have injected fresh confidence into the market, fueling an extended bull run since his victory in November 2024. The President-elect‚Äôs crypto-friendly rhetoric has also revived hopes of greater adoption and innovation in the sector. Investors appear to be pricing in the possibility of relaxed regulatory frameworks, which could pave the way for enhanced institutional participation and new use cases for Bitcoin. Crypto Community Bets Big Trump‚Äôs anticipated policies have sparked debate among crypto enthusiasts and skeptics alike. While proponents celebrate the prospect of Bitcoin becoming a strategic asset for the U.S. economy, others warn of potential volatility stemming from policy overhauls. Nevertheless, Bitcoin‚Äôs record-breaking performance underscores its resilience and growing appeal as a hedge against economic uncertainty. With the cryptocurrency‚Äôs market cap now exceeding $2 trillion, it remains at the forefront of the digital asset revolution. As Trump prepares to assume office, all eyes are on the administration‚Äôs next moves and their potential to shape the future of Bitcoin and the broader crypto market.

On the sidelines, established player Solana (SOL) has been making big moves the last week despite a slow start to the year. However, investors are increasingly looking for projects that offer something different, and many are setting their sights on Rollblock as a preferable option. Rollblock ($RBLK) offers an engaging iGaming environment while employing blockchain principles in its design to ensure fairness for players, while adding a twist to the usual casino setup. So how will Rollblock, Solana, and Shiba Inu perform in the next quarter? Solana Sees 39% Rise In A Week Solana (SOL) has been on a tear this week, rising by 39% over its duration. Solana is now trading at $261.63, having posted a 19.12% gain in the last 24 hours alone. So why is Solana seeing so much traction? It could have to do with the technological foundation Solana has built for itself throughout 2024. The year saw the introduction of the Firedancer validator client, which boosted the network‚Äôs transaction throughput drastically. Despite this, Solana (SOL) has faced some criticisms for a slew of network outages that plagued users on the platform throughout 2023 and 2024. Recent rises may be partially attributed to this issue being ironed out by the developers. Shiba Inu Loses 6% In 24 Hours Shiba Inu had several ups and downs throughout January. In particular, it saw wild fluctuations between the 2nd and 8th and again between the 15th and 17th, to reach a net monthly gain of 6%. But the last 24 hours have shattered Shiba Inu, as it fell by 6%. Shiba Inu developers have been busy trying to introduce more utility to Shiba Inu‚Äôs ecosystem as they attempt to lift it from its meme coin reputation. Rollblock Raises the Bar for GambleFi Rollblock ($RBLK) is redefining the $450 billion online gambling market with its innovative GambleFi platform. Combining blockchain transparency with an extensive iGaming ecosystem, Rollblock addresses the critical issues of trust and fairness that have plagued traditional casinos for the past decade. Built on Ethereum, Rollblock ensures every transaction and bet is immutable and tamper-proof. The platform features over 7,000 games, including live casino classics like baccarat and blackjack, as well as modern virtual experiences such as ‚ÄúMystic Safari‚Äù and ‚ÄúAstro Dash.‚Äù Its recently launched sportsbook has also gained traction, generating $1.75 million in wagers in December and driving a 600% increase in deposits and sign-ups. Rollblock‚Äôs tokenomics set it apart from its competitors. Up to 30% of weekly profits are allocated to repurchasing $RBLK tokens from the open market, with 60% burned to increase scarcity and 40% distributed as staking rewards to native token holders. Licensed by Anjouan Gaming, Rollblock operates as a fully verified and transparent casino. Collaborating with over 20 leading gaming providers, the platform ensures all games are provably fair, addressing a major pain point in the online gambling industry. Rollblock Closes In On $9 Million In Presale While Solana and Shiba Inu have proven their ability to generate returns, Rollblock ($RBLK) offers a unique and transformative approach to GambleFi that could redefine the market. Proactive investors can snap up $RBLK tokens for just $0.046 in stage 9 of its presale , which has nearly raised $9 million and continues to gather momentum. As analysts forecast an 880% rise during the presale and up to a 100x return post-launch, iGaming and DeFi enthusiasts alike will not want to miss out on Rollblock ($RBLK) in 2025.

It has attracted huge liquidity that has helped the token enter the top 20 cryptos in the market. Meanwhile, Bitcoin, which traded within a narrow range and was believed to head back below $100K, suddenly surged and formed a new ATH above $109K in no time. Hence, there is a huge possibility that the BTC price will break above $110K soon after the new president‚Äôs inauguration. Along with the new president, the SEC is expected to get a new chairman, Gary Gensler, who will take an exit from his position. With this, the market is anticipated to take a major shift towards less stringent regulations under Trump‚Äôs inauguration. This may further usher in a new era for digital assets, bolstering the growth across the board. With a potential Bitcoin reserve announcement, there has not been any major correction in the BTC price. The Bitcoin price is sitting at a new ATH, which suggests investor sentiment is moving around the long-term prospect instead of short-term profit-making. Presently, BTC has entered into the profit-taking stage but this could be just a start. The BTC price has entered the final resistance before entering the discovery phase, which is also the neckline of the ‚Äòw-shaped‚Äô or double bottom pattern. The supertrend has turned bullish, which suggests more upside potential is on the horizon. Besides, the RSI is heading towards the upper threshold and once these levels enter the overbought zone, Bitcoin is expected to mark a new ATH at around $115K. A minor retracement to the resistance-turned-support zone between $107.9 and $109.3 is possible but it could be for a short time frame. However, the ongoing TRUMP & MELANIA mania is assumed to be the reason for the volatility within the markets. Therefore, a major change is expected in the next few days, but the sustainability of the rally above the gains remains unclear.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|REGULATION|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-20 07:56:02

The Mystery Behind the Mega Purchase,https://coinpedia.org/news/did-donald-trump-buy-48-million-ethereum-the-mystery-behind-the-mega-purchase/,"The post Did Donald Trump Buy $48 Million Ethereum? The Mystery Behind the Mega Purchase appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News While the White House is making its last-minute arrangements to welcome Donald Trump, ventures and persons linked to the Trump family have made some sensational moves in the cryptocurrency market. The latest is the massive Ethereum purchase done by World Liberty Financial. Interesting, hinting at more exciting developments, Eric Trump states: ‚ÄúWait until you see what they do tomorrow.‚Äù Definitely, the Trump family‚Äôs engagements have created extreme excitement in the market. The element of curiosity has been lifted to its peak. What‚Äôs next? Let‚Äôs examine the scenario a bit deeper. Ready? Dive in! Trump‚Äôs WLF‚Äôs $48 Million Ethereum Purchase On January 19, World Liberty Financial, a DeFi venture linked to US President-elect Donald Trump, acquired as much as 14,403 ETH at an average price per coin of $3,300. This indicates that the DeFi project invested at least $48 million to materise the deal. Data shows that, with the recent purchase, the total ETH holdings of WLF has surged to around 28,612 ETH. Considering that, at the time of writing, the price of Ethereum stands at $3,357, the value of the total ETH holdings of WLT is at least $96,050,484. Analysts, like Min Jung, opine that WLF operates more like a fund than a traditional DeFi protocol. WLF Token Sales and Asset Growth Reports suggest that WLF has sold at least 20% of its total token supply. Highlighting that the WLF team is preparing to utilise the growing demand for the asset, reports also reveal that it is set to open an additional block of 5% of the supply. According to reports, the value of the total holdings of WLF has sharply surged from around $187 million to over $235 million. Trump Family‚Äôs Growing Crypto Influence In the last weekend, at least two sensational meme coin launches were made by the Trump family. $TRUMP, launched on January 18, has seen a growth of 837.15% so far. Its price now stands at $60.61. At one point on January 19, it touched a peak of $72.62. $MELANIA, introduced a day after the launch of $TRUMP, has witnessed a surge of 42.80%. Its price now remains at $13.06. At one point on January 20, it reached a peak of $12.95. In the last 24 hours alone, the meme coin has experienced a rise of 75.8%. Eric Trump, the son of Donald Trump, expresses extreme happiness about the way his family has created a buzz in the cryptocurrency market. Meanwhile, he also hints at more sensational developments. WLT‚Äôs Controversial Actions & Market Concerns Recently, WLT‚Äôs action to move $60 million in assets triggered serious speculations. Later, the WLT team, dismissing all the speculations that emerged related to the action, defended it as ‚Äúroutine treasury management‚Äù. In conclusion, World Liberty Financial‚Äôs strategic Ethereum acquisition, coupled with the Trump family‚Äôs meme coin ventures, underscores the intersection of crypto and politics.

Back in late 2020, the SEC sued Ripple Labs, alleging that XRP was being sold as an unregistered security. This lawsuit has been dragging on for nearly four years, and many in the crypto community are now wondering if it‚Äôs about to come to an end. The SEC has recently doubled down on its appeal, arguing that the court erred in deciding that XRP sales were not securities. However, some legal experts, including former SEC lawyer Marc Fagel, believe that the case could continue for another 10 months, or possibly be dropped if new SEC leadership decides not to pursue it. With Gary Gensler‚Äôs exit from the SEC, there is a growing possibility that the new leadership may go ahead with what Fagel said. Ripple‚Äôs legal team remains confident that the SEC‚Äôs arguments are weak and that the appeal could be dismissed. If Ripple wins, it could have far-reaching effects on the crypto market. A ruling in Ripple‚Äôs favor would set a precedent for other cryptocurrencies, potentially shielding them from SEC scrutiny. On the other hand, if the SEC wins, it could create broader regulatory challenges for tokens that rely on community-driven hype or marketing, as they might be classified as securities. XRP Rally Continues: XRP has just reached its highest price since 2018, surpassing $3.Several factors could push XRP to higher levels. A favorable outcome in the SEC lawsuit would act as a major catalyst for growth. Additionally, the broader adoption of Ripple‚Äôs technology in cross-border payments could drive more demand for XRP.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP|ALTCOIN|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-20 08:14:41

The altcoins are also in the green now on a daily scale, even though they plunged during the Monday morning Asian trading session. BTC‚Äôs New Peak The past seven days showcased what bitcoin and the crypto markets are capable of. Recall that the largest digital asset plunged beneath $90,000 for the first time since November last Monday after a massive daily drop of more than seven grand. However, it reacted well to this crash and started to recover some value almost immediately. It kept climbing by the end of the trading week and saw its price cruise above $100,000 after the more favorable CPI data that came out on Wednesday. Although all eyes were on Trump‚Äôs meme coin during the weekend, BTC maintained its position and even spiked to $106,000 on Sunday. That‚Äôs when real volatility transpired, as the cryptocurrency plummeted once again by several grand amounts to under $100,000. As the market was preparing for another price slip ahead of Trump‚Äôs inauguration today, bitcoin reversed its trajectory and skyrocketed to over $109,000 to mark a new all-time high. As of now, it stands at just over $108,000. Its market cap has soared to $2.140 trillion, while its dominance over the alts is at 55.4%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView LINK on the Move Most altcoins went through similar volatility on Monday morning but have turned green on a daily scale. Ethereum has tapped $3,400 after a 5.5% surge since yesterday. ADA has jumped to $1.1 after a similar increase. XRP, BNB, DOGE, XLM, TRX, and AVAX are also in the green. LINK has stolen the show today with a massive 15% surge. As a result, Chainlink‚Äôs token now sits above $26. The two newest and most controversial meme coins ‚Äì TRUMP and MELANIA ‚Äì faced massive price volatility and is expected to continue as the day progresses.

The acquisitions , valued at $48 million, bring the platform‚Äôs total Ethereum holdings to 33,630 ETH, worth over $107 million, according to data from Arkham Intelligence. This surge in ETH accumulation comes as the ETH/BTC ratio, which measures Ether‚Äôs strength relative to Bitcoin, experienced a 0.79% increase, reaching 0.03197. This marks a slight rebound for Ethereum , which had dropped 18% against Bitcoin in the last six weeks. Speculation Grows Amid Ether Price Swings The rationale behind World Liberty Financial‚Äôs Ether purchases remains unclear. However, Eric Trump, an adviser to the platform and son of Donald Trump, hinted at forthcoming developments in a Jan. 19 X post, writing, ‚ÄúWait until you see what they do tomorrow.‚Äù Amid these developments, Ether has experienced price fluctuations, trading between $3,133.98 and $3,439.78 within 24 hours. Despite this volatility, ETH price dipped 1.5% on the day, settling at $3,230, per CoinGecko. Interestingly, the token‚Äôs activity coincided with a spike in Google search trends for ‚ÄúEthereum,‚Äù reaching peak popularity on Jan. 19. Memecoin Craze Adds to Market Drama The crypto market frenzy wasn‚Äôt limited to Ether. The Trump family‚Äôs recent ventures into memecoins have stirred significant attention. On the eve of his presidential inauguration, Donald Trump launched a memecoin that saw its market cap plummet by $5 billion following the debut of MELANIA, a memecoin launched by the incoming First Lady, Melania Trump. Melania‚Äôs memecoin gained remarkable traction, achieving a valuation of $6 billion within two hours of its release. The project‚Äôs website described the token as a means for supporters to express their allegiance. Meanwhile, Donald Trump‚Äôs memecoin took a hit, dropping 38% in just 40 minutes, according to CoinMarketCap.

This milestone reflects strong buying demand and growing market optimism for the leading cryptocurrency. BTC is currently trading just below its peak, but bullish momentum suggests the rally could continue. Despite a challenging market environment, BTC‚Äôs price remains supported by increased spot inflows, which have reached a 30-day high. According to Coinglass, this rise in inflows signals growing interest and robust buying activity. The balance of power (BoP) indicator, currently trending positively, confirms that buyers are dominating and pushing prices upward. When spot inflows rise, more funds enter the market, often leading to higher demand. With limited supply, this demand has been a key driver of BTC‚Äôs upward trajectory. Analysts suggest that if this momentum persists, Bitcoin could surpass its latest peak and aim for the $110,000 mark . However, increased selloffs might push the price below $100,000. Bitcoin‚Äôs performance is also expected to face volatility around Donald Trump‚Äôs upcoming inauguration. Speculation is growing that he might reference the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve , which could have far-reaching implications for the crypto market. Tom Trowbridge, CEO of Fluence, shared insights on the potential impact of the Trump administration on cryptocurrency. He described the moment as transformative for the crypto ecosystem, with the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve possibly sparking a global race among nations to accumulate Bitcoin and other digital assets. He added that the US's pro-crypto stance could encourage favorable legislation worldwide. While Bitcoin continues to chart new heights, market participants are closely monitoring whether buying pressure will sustain its rally or if profit-taking will lead to a pullback. The coming days could determine if BTC breaks past its recent all-time high or consolidates below key levels.",,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-01-20 09:09:17

After trading relatively flat over the past three months, Solana-based meme coin named ‚ÄòAmerican Coin‚Äô with the ticker ‚ÄòUSA‚Äô formed a God candle on Jan. 19 as it rose to $0.0000254, up 405% from an intraday low of $0.00000503 while its market cap surged to nearly $300 million at that time. American Coin‚Äôs (USA) dramatic rally came in a high-volume trading environment, with its daily trading volume soaring by over 550% to hover around $300 million. The surge in activity fueled speculation-driven gains, pushing the meme coin to trend on platforms like CoinGecko. While the meme coin project has no affiliation with the country USA, the majority of gains witnessed on Sunday came after community members reported that incoming U.S. President Donald Trump is potentially considering launching a USA meme coin possibly by the end of this week. Notably, USA coin, which shares a similar name, had already been in the market prior to these rumors. The speculation surrounding a presidential link fueled confusion and boosted interest in the token despite it not being directly connected to any official initiative or the potential launch of a new meme coin. However, the gains were short-lived, and the token crashed as Eric Trump, the upcoming President‚Äôs second eldest son, debunked the rumors, clarifying that the USA coin had nothing to do with the Trump family.

Such occurrences are common in hype-driven meme coins, and the phenomenon was also observed in recent Trump family-launched meme coins such as the Official Trump ( TRUMP ) token and Melania Meme ( MELANIA ). On Jan. 17, Trump unveiled the TRUMP meme coin, which subsequently surged over 1,000% within the next day, bringing its market cap to over $14.5 billion. Similarly, MELANIA also showcased increased volatility after its launch, initially surging nearly 75% to an all-time high of $13.04 within two hours. The price then dropped to $7.43 before rebounding above $13 and eventually stabilizing at over $11.

The token linked to Melania Trump gained over 69% in the last 24 hours, trading at an average price of $12.34, at press time. MELANIA has detracted massively from the first token which has caused some bad losses for many investors.

Altcoins, specifically memecoins, also reached new highs, and their run is likely to continue as we near the start of the altcoin season. The crypto market has exploded, with Bitcoin setting new ATHs day after day and altcoins making double-digit daily gains. A fierce bull run was triggered after the pro-crypto republican candidate Donald Trump secured victory in the US presidential election, and his inauguration is set for January 20. BTC set its all-time high earlier today at $109,114, and we might see it run further amid Trump‚Äôs inauguration ceremony. Bitcoin (BTC) Soars to New ATH Amid Trump Inauguration Bitcoin's impressive surge following the election result sparked renewed interest in cryptocurrencies. With BTC leading the charge, altcoins have firmly followed in its footsteps, and the memecoin sector has gained immensely. The renewed interest gives market watchers a glimpse of what is possible as traders and investors gear up for the incoming administration. Let‚Äôs look at some of the hottest memecoins with immense profit potential. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin (DOGE) is the largest memecoin by market cap and is the 7th¬†largest crypto with a market cap exceeding $56.4 billion. Elon Musk, the world‚Äôs richest man with a net worth exceeding $430 billion, is the CEO of Tesla, owner of social media platform X (formerly Twitter), and one of the president-elect‚Äôs most prominent supporters and has long endorsed Dogecoin . The tech billionaire later joined the Trump campaign and was integral to Trump‚Äôs victory, and his involvement with the republican party could see DOGE run to new highs in the coming months.¬†DOGE‚Äôs surge stepped into overdrive after Donald Trump released a statement revealing that Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy will lead the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. According to Trump, DOGE will pave the way for his administration to ‚Äúdismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditure, and restructure Federal Agencies ‚Äì Essential to the ‚ÄúSave America‚Äù Movement.‚Äù DOGE is up nearly 18% in the past week, currently trading at $0.3819. Shiba Inu (SHIB): A Bargain Buy Shiba Inu (SHIB) quickly rose to fame in the crypto industry and has since become a household name with a market cap exceeding $12.7 billion . SHIB, launched in 2020, is currently the 17th largest crypto by market cap and the second biggest memecoin after Dogecoin (DOGE). This decentralized, community-led project and its native token, SHIB, quickly gained the attention of its dedicated community of investors thanks to its overall charm and support from industry giants such as Vitalik Buterin. SHIB is currently available for a bargain at $0.00002163 and has gained over 4% in the 7-day charts. SHIB gained a massive 128% over the past year, making this an attractive investment opportunity for diversifying their portfolios and stepping into the memecoin sector. Newcomer Husky Inu (HINU) Nears $700,000 in Presale As BTC hovers around the $107,000 level and large-cap altcoins make good gains, investors must look for well-priced alternative investment opportunities to profit from the bull run, and Husky Inu is precisely that. Husky Inu (HINU) is one of the newest members of the Solana network, created to bring its holders more value and utility by leveraging the power of this robust blockchain. Husky Inu recently launched the presale of its native token, HINU , with tremendous success, and the two are on a mission to conquer the memecoin industry through a robust and supportive community with innovative features and enhanced rewards. Husky Inu‚Äôs successful presale has generated nearly $700,000 since going live. Husky Inu is working on some exciting things, including an Earn App and a Decentralized Exchange. The Earn App will reward users with HINU tokens for engaging with the project, and the Decentralized Exchange will facilitate decentralized trading to improve utility and value for HINU holders. Husky Inu boasts several unique features that set it apart from traditional investment opportunities, including a capped token supply, a deflationary mechanism, speedy transactions, and charity voting.

At this point, the TRUMP and MELANIA launch has helped Solana generate record fees and revenue, pushing its total valuation past $10 billion for the first time since the FTX crash. Donald Trump‚Äôs choice to mine his memecoin on Solana increased interest in Solana and helped SOL surge more than 23% after launch and reach a new ATH. After Trump‚Äôs memecoin TRUMP was minted on January 18, the Solana blockchain generated more than $35 million in fees and $14 million in revenue over the weekend, data shows. Moonshot, the memecoin trading platform hosted on Trump's memecoin's website, reported a 12-hour trading volume of nearly $400 million after TRUMP's launch, adding more than 200,000 users to the network in the process. Experts said the launch of a cryptocurrency by a US President indicates a shift towards a more tolerant approach to crypto innovation in the US, while Trump‚Äôs preference for Solana also increases the likelihood of the SOL ETF being launched.

Decoding the Truth,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/is-the-trump-rally-a-top-signal-for-the-market-has-an-era-of-celebrity-coins-begun-decoding-the-truth/,"The post Is the TRUMP Rally a ‚ÄòTop Signal‚Äô for the Market? Has an Era of ‚ÄòCelebrity Coins‚Äô Begun? Decoding the Truth appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ever since Donald Trump was elected as the new president of the U.S., the crypto markets have turned extremely bullish. A couple of crypto-favourable moves raised optimism, which pushed the Bitcoin price beyond the $100K milestone. Moreover, with the launch of Trump‚Äôs official memecoin, OFFICIAL TRUMP, a new era of memecoins seems to have begun, which may be termed celebrity coins. Donald Trump launched his token, followed by Melania, which has circulated shockwaves across the markets. This also indicates that Trump‚Äôs administration is less interested in regulating the sentiments but more inclined to take advantage of them. Their approach appears to be using them if they are set to remain forever. The launch of TRUMP is the biggest example of it and with its decentralised nature and unrestricted market, more meme-like assets will emerge in the coming days. Should You Buy TRUMP Now? TRUMP has attracted massive liquidity, making it the fourth largest traded token after USDT, BTC, and ETH. Currently, many traders are still jumping in to buy TRUMP, despite the massive 45% plunge that occurred a few hours ago. It was launched on a Friday night with 80% of the supply in control. Besides, it is slurping liquidity from the other altcoins as well, which have exhausted the markets and also broken down the retailers. Hence, a popular analyst, Michael van de Poppe , suggests considering the altcoins, which have dropped by 20%‚Äì30% in the past couple of days, rather than buying TRUMP. The decentralised crypto market will remain a global financial commons. Besides, the administration seems to have embraced free markets instead of regulated ones. Hence, in the next four years, all kinds of experiments with memes may emerge, which could change the market dynamics. Presently, traders are aggressively buying TRUMP, even by selling their altcoins but Trump‚Äôs team is dumping their tokens . Donald Trump made over $700 million in just a couple of days while his team has sold about 12 million tokens, which is constantly mounting the selling pressure over the token. Therefore, the market participants need to be highly vigilant and think before buying TRUMP or any celebrity token.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-20 09:36:30

The TRUMP/USDT pair has emerged as the most-traded pair over the past 24 hours on the leading exchange, Binance, representing 13.3% of the total exchange volume, according to Coingecko . While this activity is thrilling, the bulls and those looking to join the market ahead of Donald Trump's inauguration might want to exercise caution, as a key derivatives market indicator has diverged bearishly from the token's rising futures open interest. Open interest in TRUMP perpetual futures has increased by 6% in the past 24 hours, according to data source Velo Data . Although prices have retraced from $70 to $58 since the Asian hours, they remain up by 3%. However, the perpetual futures cumulative volume delta, which reflects the difference between buying and selling volume, has dropped by over 1%, indicating a relative increase in selling volume. In other words, traders are either taking outright shorts or bearish bets or closing long positions. Besides, the market for TRUMP looks overheated, with those holding long positions paying an annualized funding fee of over 170% to shorts to keep their positions open. If the market stops rallying, holding longs will become a burden, potentially spurring an unwinding of the bullish bets. That, in turn, could lead to a deeper price slide. The chart shows most major cryptocurrencies have experienced a net selling in perpetual futures in the past 24 hours. Perhaps, market participants are fearing market-wide price losses in a classic ""sell the fact"" action following Trump's inauguration.",Markets|Donald Trump|Trump|Markets,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|EXCHANGE|BNB,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-20 09:38:10

However, some analysts believe that both coins have reached their pinnacle for spectacular growth, making them less likely to turn little investments into large riches. Concern over Bitcoin investment risks has led many to explore alternative tokens, including a newcomer named Remittix (RTX) . With $3,701,577.5 raised and 205,144,308.03 tokens sold at $0.0221, Remittix (RTX) aims to deliver a solution that could outshine the returns of Ethereum (ETH)and Bitcoin (BTC) in the years ahead. Ethereum (ETH): Solid but Slowing Ethereum (ETH) has been a big force in the DeFi space, running lots of decentralized apps and smart contracts. However, some people think Ethereum (ETH) is becoming more stable now, which might mean fewer huge price jumps for everyday traders. While ETH still has plenty of room to grow, doubling or tripling might be more realistic than the 50x or 100x leaps seen in its early days. As institutions keep entering the market, Ethereum (ETH)could become more ‚Äúblue-chip,‚Äù meaning steadier returns but fewer earth-shattering windfalls. Bitcoin (BTC): The Oldest Crypto Bitcoin (BTC) remains the first and most recognized cryptocurrency. Its finite supply and widespread adoption instill confidence in many, yet others worry about Bitcoin investment risks. The coin‚Äôs massive market cap means it might not deliver the jaw-dropping multipliers of its early bull runs. Indeed, BTC has shown steady, if sometimes volatile, growth, making it a potentially reliable store of value but less likely to mint instant millionaires. Investors hoping for huge gains may find themselves seeking out up-and-coming projects rather than waiting on another epic BTC rally. A New Player: Remittix (RTX) Enter Remittix (RTX), a project focusing on practical cross-border remittances. Rather than relying on hype, Remittix (RTX)aims to solve the problems of high fees and slow transaction times that plague global payments. By converting crypto into fiat and depositing it directly into bank accounts around the world, the platform targets a vast market in need of innovation. Given that Remittix (RTX)has already raised $3,701,557.5 and sold more than 205 million tokens, some argue it could mirror or even surpass the early surge once enjoyed by Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC)‚Äîbut without the same levels of speculation. Weighing Bitcoin Investment Risks To understand why some might abandon Bitcoin (BTC) for a new altcoin, it‚Äôs vital to consider Bitcoin investment risks. Regulatory questions loom large; if governments clamp down hard on BTC, its valuation could stall or decline. Additionally, competing tokens offer faster transactions and advanced functionalities. Remittix (RTX), for instance, could see rapid adoption if real-world users flock to its low-cost remittance model. In a future where practicality trumps mere recognition, tokens like RTX could capture investor attention more than legacy coins such as BTC and Ethereum (ETH). Conclusion By 2025, Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC)might maintain solid positions in the market, but their potential to turn small investments into fortunes could be limited. With Bitcoin investment risks and the possibility that ETH matures into a stable platform, many traders now look to tokens like Remittix (RTX) for a bigger upside. The platform‚Äôs focus on solving real-world finance challenges may lead to rapid user adoption, delivering gains that established coins can no longer match. Each investor has a unique risk appetite, but if explosive growth is the goal, Remittix (RTX) might be the more compelling option in a market increasingly hungry for utility.

Binance‚Äôs markets have already onboarded the new meme assets, as official tokens are much easier to verify. The launch of official tokens may be a new iteration of the fan token trend, where celebrities capitalized on their fame. Prime candidates for crypto tokens may include El Salvador‚Äôs president Nayib Bukele, and Argentina‚Äôs leader, Javier Milei. For now, Bukele has mostly focused on being a Bitcoin maximalist, while Milei seems unaware of the Solana meme space. Trump‚Äôs decision also sparked discussion of Grade-A celebrities finally launching a token. Social media posts pointed to Taylor Swift or Mr. Beast as having the cultural clout for a successful, mass-adoption token. No official tokens have been confirmed, but traders may be on the lookout for new launches. Politician or top celebrity tokens are seen as a new class of asset with potential utility. Governance, fan token burns or a rating based on price have been proposed as potential use cases for a new wave of official celebrity tokens. However, the crypto space remains illiquid and even official assets may be increasingly volatile or easily manipulated by early whales. Politician or celebrity tokens, however, may not work in all regions, due to available funds and liquidity. US-based celebrities and politicians may have a wider reach and a much larger pool of potential buyers. TRUMP is a unique case, which tapped the political energy of a highly contested election. Celebrity meme tokens gain listings faster The cultural clout and connections of celebrity tokens meant they gained listings more easily. TRUMP and MELANIA were among the new additions to Hyperliquid soon after the token launches. TRUMP was also added to the Coinbase roadmap, with a potential listing coming soon. However, the news did not translate into price action, as the token started showing weakness after a few hours. Assets added to the roadmap today: Official Trump (TRUMP) https://t.co/rRB9d3hSr2 ‚Äî Coinbase Assets üõ°Ô∏è (@CoinbaseAssets) January 19, 2025 Just a day later, MELANIA also gained a listing on Binance Futures, though with no guarantee of gaining a spot market. The listing on Coinbase reflects demand from US-based traders, who want to gain easier access to the token. The listing of TRUMP follows a trend of ‚ÄòMade in USA‚Äô crypto tokens, especially those using the Solana ecosystem. Fan tokens get a boost from Trump Official Before Trump‚Äôs official token launch, several waves of fan tokens competed for the attention of traders. Some, like CardiB‚Äôs WAP token, launched with controversy and insider selling. Others, like Andrew Tate‚Äôs DADDY, go through regular pumps, often traced back to Tate himself. Some, like Hailey Welch‚Äôs token, behaved like risky memes, performing a rug pull soon after launch. Overall, celebrity-themed tokens are a small subset, valued at a total of $76M. The recent launch of TRUMP caused rallies for most of the tokens. The mindshare of meme tokens, which has been lagging for weeks, tripled in just a day. TRUMP, MELANIA and BARRON were among the mindshare leaders , but gave a boost to other related tokens. Fan tokens also gained popularity after the launch of Kekius Maximus (KEKIUS), after Elon Musk briefly swapped his used name on X. Football fan tokens are also a small category that may give some hints on how TRUMP and MELANIA may play out. Club-related fan tokens are seen as more stable, with less probability of a rug pull. Occasionally, some of the assets rally, if a token gains more mainstream attention. Along with the official tokens, Pump.fun replied with a new wave of launches. Some were spoofing the Official Trump asset, while others played on themes of patriotism or financial independence. Trump‚Äôs launch was also crossed over with AI tokens, with new AI agent personalities also created around his brand.

Bitcoin has reached an all-time high of $109,241, marking a 6% surge in an hour, as traders speculate on the pro-crypto policies Trump may announce. Here‚Äôs what to expect! Trump‚Äôs Inauguration Ceremony The inauguration ceremony will begin at 12 p.m. ET (17:00 GMT), where Chief Justice John Roberts will administer the oath of office. Trump‚Äôs victory over Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential race has brought him back to the White House. The crypto market is growing with excitement, fueled by Trump‚Äôs pledge to turn the U.S. into a global crypto hub. Just hours before the ceremony, Bitcoin hit a record $109K , with a market cap of $2.15 trillion. Other cryptocurrencies also experienced significant gains, with Ethereum surging by 6% to reach $3,384.20. Meanwhile, XRP and Dogecoin saw notable increases of 5% and 2.4%, respectively. Pro-Crypto Moves from Trump‚Äôs Administration Trump‚Äôs administration is already taking steps that could favor the crypto market by appointing crypto-friendly leaders to key positions. He has chosen Paul Atkins , a former SEC official known for supporting deregulation, to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Additionally, David Sacks , a former PayPal executive, has been named the White House crypto czar. Sacks will work on developing a legal framework for cryptocurrencies, a move long awaited by the industry. Trump has also formed a new Department of Government Efficiency, led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, to drive innovation and reduce government costs. Experts Weigh In Market analysts are optimistic about the impact of Trump‚Äôs presidency on digital assets. Xremlin, a well-known market expert, believes this could be a ‚Äúgolden era‚Äù for crypto. He predicts that U.S.-based coins and assets tied to the Trump family could see significant growth.

As the demand level rises, it shows signs of strength following a bounce back this week. Avax ended a five-week correction with a double-bottom pattern after staying above $32 this week. Because of the hold, this price level is now considered base support on the daily chart. The bulls acted upon that, and as we can see on the daily chart, the bullish pattern is interestingly playing out well as they have gained control of the market since the start of this week. A further surge in volatility should strengthen the market and bring more growth. However, the latest surge has yet to confirm a breakout. A strong push above the previous monthly high should validate a break, which could lead to a mega rally in the near term. There‚Äôs nothing much to expect from the bears, as they are currently off the market. If they manage to step back in, we may see a drop. Still, the price must break below the monthly low before confirming a continuation. But following the latest positive sentiment surrounding the entire market lately, there‚Äôs no room for selling. The bulls will likely have an upper hand in the future. Avax‚Äôs Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview The potential obstacle for buying right now is the $45 resistance level. If the bulls overcome, they may face resistance at $50 before reclaiming the $55.5 resistance, where a major breakout lies. Currently, there are no signs of bears in the market. If they intercept the latest buying, the support level to watch for a pullback is $38. Failure to bounce off it could result in a dip to $33.6 and potentially $30.6.

It broke briefly out to a new high as the bulls stepped back but can they stay long? The past month saw Hbar through a little retracement as the price tested a low of $0.23 a month ago. This low level held firmly and the price recovered briefly for days. It lost grip again and fell but the price quickly bounced back from $0.25 on Monday. Technically, that bounce brought an end to the correction phase and the price increased significantly the following day. Volatility increased yesterday and the price broke out to a new high of $0.4 today. The breakout is not clear enough, but looking at the market structure, we can expect a bigger price movement in the coming days. This anticipated movement could see us to the $1 level as the demand level rises. Looking at the price actions, the bulls are fully back in control. Though the bears are in disbelief as they hope to claim more lows ‚Äì but currently appear trapped on the daily chart. They will likely suffer more loss when the bulls mount pressure in the market. HBAR‚Äôs Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview Following the price break, the resistance level to consider for a test on the way up is $0.5 along with the $0.6 level. A continuous surge through these levels could bring us to $0.7 in no time. The support level to watch for a pullback is $0.30. If the price pulls below $0.234, we may see a breakdown to the $0.187 level. Key Resistance Levels: $0.5, $0.6, $0.7 Key Support Levels: $0.30, $0.234, $0.187 Spot Price: $0.371 Trend: Bullish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Expert Recommends Monitoring This $0.14 Altcoin Pre-listing,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/how-high-can-cardano-ada-go-after-trump-expert-recommends-monitoring-this-0-14-altcoin-pre-listing/,"As the crypto market faces mounting volatility, Cardano (ADA) remains a beacon of hope for long-term investors, and with recent developments, including the endorsement of ADA by former U.S. President Donald Trump, all eyes are on how the price will respond. But while Cardano shows promise, another altcoin is generating increasing interest: DTX Exchange (DTX) , a promising project that has already raised over $12 million during its ongoing presale. With ADA breaking key technical levels and DTX poised for an explosive debut, traders are split between these two high-potential blockchain platforms. Cardano Price Surges as Trump‚Äôs Endorsement Fuels Bullish Momentum Cardano has emerged as a strong performer in the current market, breaking out of an inverted head-and-shoulders pattern, a classic bullish signal. With ADA trading at $1.14, analysts suggest the token could rally to $1.63 if it holds above the critical $1.15 support level. This optimism is fueled by Trump‚Äôs pro-crypto policies, which have created a favorable backdrop for blockchain projects like Cardano. Trump‚Äôs endorsement has heightened interest in ADA, with whales accumulating 130 million tokens in the past week, signaling confidence in the token‚Äôs potential. ADA‚Äôs Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently sits at 63, indicating plenty of room for growth as traders eye the next resistance level. Coupled with increased trading volumes and a recovering market, Cardano appears poised for further upside, driven by both technical and macroeconomic factors. DTX: The $0.14 Altcoin Positioned for a Breakout While Cardano rides the wave of Trump‚Äôs endorsement, DTX Exchange is carving out its own path as a next-gen blockchain platform. Powered by its VulcanX blockchain, which achieved a groundbreaking 200,000 transactions per second (TPS) during its testnet, DTX is setting a new standard for Layer-1 scalability. The DTX Token, priced at $0.14 during its presale, has already raised over $12 million, reflecting strong investor interest. The platform‚Äôs unique approach integrates multi-asset trading, offering access to cryptocurrencies, stocks, forex, and tokenized real-world assets within a unified ecosystem. The Phoenix Wallet, with over 330,000 downloads, has played a pivotal role in DTX‚Äôs rapid adoption. By providing secure, decentralized storage and seamless trading capabilities, the wallet has cemented itself as an essential tool for modern traders. Analysts predict that DTX could see a 13,200% surge, driven by its technological superiority and growing adoption, potentially reaching a $10 billion market cap. Trump Effect: A Catalyst for Both ADA and DTX Donald Trump‚Äôs return to office has sent shockwaves through the crypto market, with his administration‚Äôs pro-crypto policies expected to drive significant growth across the industry. Trump‚Äôs endorsement of blockchain technology and his appointments of industry-friendly regulators have created a bullish environment for projects like ADA and DTX. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently highlighted the ‚ÄúTrump effect,‚Äù noting its potential to accelerate crypto adoption and regulatory clarity. For DTX Exchange, which is gearing up for its official launch, the timing couldn‚Äôt be better, as the platform seeks to capitalize on the market‚Äôs growing appetite for scalable and utility-driven solutions. Market Outlook As 2025 begins, Cardano and DTX Exchange represent two distinct yet equally promising paths in the crypto market. ADA‚Äôs Trump-driven momentum highlights its enduring appeal, while DTX‚Äôs technological innovation and rapid growth make it a standout among emerging altcoins. For investors, these two projects offer a glimpse into the future of blockchain technology, each with the potential to deliver significant returns in the months ahead.

The ‚ÄòRich Dad Poor Dad‚Äô author limited his comments on the coin but offered a general perspective on cryptocurrency, stating that the sector as a whole is evolving into a ‚Äúfarce,‚Äù straying from its initial purpose as the future of finance , he said in an X post on January 19. With the unveiling of celebrity-endorsed tokens like TRUMP, which lack significant underlying fundamentals, Kiyosaki argued that the sector is becoming tyrannical. ‚ÄúWhat do I think about TRUMP COIN? Not much. Unfortunately, the whole crypto world is becoming a ‚Äútranny‚Äù transforming from the ‚Äúfuture‚Äù to a farce,‚Äù Kiyosaki said. The financial educator also used the opportunity to emphasize his investment philosophy, anchored in tangible assets like gold , silver , and Bitcoin ( BTC ), while dismissing other products such as exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ). Indeed, Kiyosaki remains bullish on these three commodities , projecting they are ideal stores of wealth, especially during his forecast of an impending market crash . What do I think about TRUMP COIN? Not much. Unfortunately, the whole crypto world is becoming a ‚Äútranny‚Äù transformimg from the ‚Äúfuture‚Äù to a ‚Äúfarce.‚Äù I hold my course buying real Gold, real silver, and real Bitcoin. As a personal rule I do not invest in any ETFs. I am old‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) January 19, 2025 TRUMP launch controversy On January 17, Trump surprised the cryptocurrency and the financial world in general by announcing the launch of TRUMP in what he described as a celebration. The coin launched on the Solana ( SOL ) network experienced a meteoric rise within hours, surging by about 30,000% to peak at $75 on January 19. However, TRUMP later suffered a significant correction, losing almost 50% of its value and dropping to $40 at one point before recovering. The drop was attributed to investors redirecting capital to another new meme coin launched by incoming First Lady Melania Trump, MELANIA, which also recorded a meteoric rise. TRUMP‚Äôs price recovery emerged in the wake of news regarding the continued listing of the coins on major trading platforms. Robinhood (NASDAQ: HOOD ) is among the latest platforms to announce the listing, joining other exchanges, including Bitget , KuCoin , and Kraken . The coin‚Äôs structure‚Äî80% of its supply reportedly held in Trump‚Äôs wallet and no lockup period‚Äîhas raised ethical concerns about potential market manipulation and a ‚Äúrug pull.‚Äù TRUMP token distribution by group. Source: The Kobeissi Letter To this end, cryptocurrency scam investigator Stephen Findeisen (Coffeezilla) criticized the setup and speculated that incoming regulators might protect the project from legal scrutiny. Overall, given Trump‚Äôs pledge to spearhead cryptocurrency growth in the United States once he assumes office, his decision to roll out a highly speculative asset with no underlying value has elicited questions about its impact on more established entities like Bitcoin. TRUMP price analysis As of press time, TRUMP was valued at $57, dropping nearly 9% in the past 24 hours. Its market capitalization was about $11.45 billion. The sudden surge in TRUMP‚Äôs value and recovery since Sunday‚Äôs dip suggests potential for further growth, driven by any hype surrounding Trump‚Äôs January 20 inauguration. Like all other meme cryptocurrencies, the coin remains precarious due to the volatility associated with such an asset. However, as the first meme token launched by a U.S. president, it remains to be seen which direction the coin will ultimately take. Featured image via Ben Shapiro‚Äôs YouTube . The post R.

However, controversy arose after the launch of the TRUMP and MELANIA meme coins. The rapid succession of the launch attracted allegations of pump-and-dump schemes and market manipulation. Meanwhile, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong recently advocated for global Bitcoin reserves, which could not only help the states or countries that adopt these reserves, but could give the price of Bitcoin a nice boost as well. Bitcoin Surges Past $109K! The price of Bitcoin surged by over 6% in mere minutes, which allowed it to reach a new all-time high (ATH) just hours before Donald Trump‚Äôs inauguration as the 47th President of the United States. On Jan. 20, Bitcoin briefly jumped past $109,000 to set a new peak at $109,114, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Bitcoin‚Äôs price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Its previous ATH was close to $108,000, which was set on Dec. 17, 2024. However, the price quickly retreated below $108,000 shortly after hitting the milestone. At press time, BTC was trading hands at $107,677. Bitcoin‚Äôs price climbed by approximately 3% in the past 24 hours. This surge happened in the middle of the heightened anticipation of Trump‚Äôs swearing-in ceremony that is scheduled for 4:00 pm UTC. Beyond Bitcoin, the event fueled widespread bullish sentiment in the crypto market. His November election victory already led to a massive rally, which pushed Bitcoin above $100,000 for the first time in early December of 2024. Optimism in the crypto community is also growing because of Trump‚Äôs crypto-friendly stance. His proposed plans to potentially establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve and pursue regulatory easing in the crypto sector made a lot of traders and analysts very excited, and it very likely contributed to the latest rally. TRUMP and MELANIA Tokens Spark Controversy While Trump‚Äôs inauguration may be behind Bitcoin‚Äôs latest achievement, the soon-to-be President and his team are still under scrutiny due to allegations of orchestrating a ‚Äúpump and dump scheme‚Äù after the launch of back-to-back meme coins. On Jan. 18, the Official Trump (TRUMP) token was introduced, and it quickly soared to a $15 billion market cap. The next day, Melania Trump launched her own self-branded meme coin, MELANIA. These launches so close in succession caused widespread accusations of unethical behavior. Critics pointed to the rapid succession of launches as evidence of greed. Jim Bianco , president of Bianco Research, shared his thoughts on the strategy, and believes that the introduction of MELANIA after TRUMP‚Äôs success was seen as dilution. The market reacted quite unfavorably as the TRUMP token lost more than 30% of its value in just hours after MELANIA‚Äôs debut. Naturally, the fallout attracted a lot of sharp criticism. Edward Dowd , founder of Phinance Technologies, described the situation as the largest unforced error ahead of a presidential inauguration. Financial analyst Michael A. Gayed called the TRUMP token a ‚Äúpump and dump‚Äù scheme, and shared that Trump‚Äôs credibility was irreparably damaged. Jos√© Maria Macedo , co-founder of Delphi Labs, suggested that the launches were rushed attempts to capitalize on the success of TRUMP. Ryan Selkis , a Trump supporter and former CEO of Messari, even recommended that Trump fire the developers behind the MELANIA token because of their incompetence. The launch of MELANIA also coincided with a broader downturn in the crypto market , as Bitcoin fell nearly 6% from $105,900 to below $99,650. However, Bitcoin was able to reach its new ATH not too long after. Despite the controversy, the two tokens still attracted a lot of¬†attention from traders, with a combined market cap of more than $16 billion. For now, the launches and their aftermath caused intense debate about the ethical implications and potential legal ramifications of the meme coins. Coinbase CEO Pushes for Global Bitcoin Reserves Despite the volatility caused by Trump‚Äôs inauguration and meme coin drama, Bitcoin could still receive a nice boost after Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, advocated for global leaders to establish Bitcoin strategic reserves. Overall, he believes crypto is a key component of the future digital economy. In a Jan. 17 blog post, Armstrong described cryptocurrencies as ‚Äúthe next chapter of capitalism‚Äù and urged policymakers to adopt crypto-friendly laws, improve government efficiency, create special economic zones, and consider Bitcoin reserves as a hedge against inflation. He also speculated that Bitcoin could play a role as major as gold in the global economy and could even potentially shift the balance of power among nations. (Source: Coinbase ) Over the past year, Coinbase deepened its political influence by donating more than $45 million to the Fairshake PAC and $1 million to President-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs inauguration fund during the 2024 election cycle. Armstrong also met with Trump in November to discuss personnel appointments. Many people believed that this was a clear sign that the company could play a major role when it comes to shaping US crypto policy. Trump is reportedly considering making cryptocurrency a national priority in 2025. Although Coinbase and its execs are excited about the future of crypto in the US, legal challenges involving Coinbase and US regulators are still¬†unresolved. The SEC filed an enforcement action against Coinbase in 2023 due to unregistered securities exchange activities. Coinbase also pursued lawsuits against the SEC and FDIC over alleged attempts to debank crypto firms. With the Trump administration is set to take office and possibly reframe the SEC‚Äôs leadership, the future of these legal battles and the broader regulatory environment of the US is still unclear for now. Wyoming Pushes for Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Some US states are taking the Coinbase CEO‚Äôs advice to heart. Wyoming recently introduced a bill to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, which made it the latest US state to consider investing state funds in Bitcoin. The bill is titled ‚Äú State Funds-investment in Bitcoin ,‚Äù and was announced on Jan. 17. It¬†allows a portion of Wyoming‚Äôs state funds to be allocated to Bitcoin if passed. Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis, who is a very well known Bitcoin advocate, praised Representative Jacob Wasserburger for spearheading the legislation, which she described as a ‚Äúforward-thinking approach‚Äù that positions Wyoming as a leader in financial innovation. The proposed legislation will permit the Wyoming state treasurer to invest funds from the general fund, the permanent Wyoming mineral trust fund, and the permanent land fund in Bitcoin. However, each fund is limited to a maximum allocation of 3%. If the market value of the Bitcoin investments in any fund rises over the 3% cap, the treasurer will not be obligated to sell assets to comply with the limit. Several other states, including Pennsylvania, Texas , Ohio, New Hampshire, Oklahoma , North Dakota, and Massachusetts, have also introduced similar Strategic Bitcoin Reserve bills. The push for these reserves were likely made due to the increasing speculation that President-elect Donald Trump may prioritize the establishment of a national Bitcoin reserve after taking office on Jan. 20.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING|FIAT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-20 10:06:35

The proceeds were converted into SOL and directed toward purchasing $TRUMP. Just two hours later, the trader liquidated their $TRUMP position, realizing a profit of nearly $172,000. Using this profit, they returned to SWARMS through a new address, acquiring $485,000 worth of tokens at an average price of $0.1215. This move added 1.35 million SWARMS tokens to their holdings. SWARMS Market Overview SWARMS has experienced a significant price pullback, trading well below its recent highs. Despite this correction, the project continues to demonstrate strong liquidity, indicating sustained market interest. The current price levels could attract value-seeking buyers eyeing a potential rebound. If momentum builds, SWARMS has the capability to recover and push higher, making it an attractive option for traders willing to capitalize on volatility. Strategic Moves by Whales This latest activity highlights the strategic approach whales are taking with SWARMS. By leveraging market corrections and reinvesting profits, they position themselves for potential long-term gains. The cycle of buying low and selling high demonstrates confidence in the project‚Äôs fundamentals and liquidity strength, even amid short-term price fluctuations.

According to data from Etherscan, Orbiter Finance has already made its first donation of 10 ETH ( ETH ), worth around $33,607, to the smart contract wallet for Trump‚Äôs token, World Liberty Financial. The donation was made through Orbiter‚Äôs OmniChain interoperability protocol. Donald Trump is scheduled to be sworn in as president on Monday, Jan. 20 inside the Capitol rotunda around mid-day. In a recent post , the protocol also vowed to keep sending donations throughout Donald Trump‚Äôs presidency after he takes office. Orbiter is not the only crypto firm to sponsor Trump‚Äôs inauguration. According to the Politico , major crypto companies including Ripple, Coinbase, Kraken and Robinhood have donated at least $10 million into the Trump inaugural fund to welcome the new pro-crypto president-elect into the oval office. You might also like: Orbiter Finance to airdrop OBT tokens on Trump‚Äôs inauguration Prior to the donation announcement, Orbiter declared that it would release its governance token, OBT , on the day of Trump‚Äôs inauguration.

The remaining 3% of the airdrop will then be distributed monthly over a period of six months. In order to be eligible for the airdrop, users must have actively interacted with Orbiter‚Äôs cross-chain protocol for at least 60 days since December 2021. Coincidentally, ahead of his inauguration, Trump had launched his very own meme coin $TRUMP ( TRUMP ) on Jan. 18. The $TRUMP token has accumulated a market cap of more than $10 billion within 24 hours of its launch. Former Coinbase CTO, Balaji Srinivasan, had urged the President-elect to distribute some $TRUMP tokens via airdrop to every U.S. citizen through a mailing list. He believes a massive airdrop could sway Democrats into supporting Trump‚Äôs presidency as well as his pro-crypto policies.

Bitcoin has touched a new ATH today and seems ready for explosive growth in the upcoming sessions. Digital assets remained at the core of Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign, and the momentum isn‚Äôt slowing down.

According to Bloomberg , President-elect Donald Trump is planning to release an executive order elevating crypto as a policy priority and giving industry insiders a voice within his administration. The prevailing broad market outlook suggests extended bullishness for crypto prices. While most digital assets signal robust gains in the upcoming sessions, specific segments will outperform. AI agents have dominated crypto trends since Q4 2024, with the likes of ai16z and Virtual Protocols skyrocketing to record peaks. Artificial intelligence proves crucial for the crypto market, and experts believe the narrative will drive 2025‚Äôs bull run. That likely explains the massive interest IDEGEN has seen since its ICO launch. The early-stage crypto AI project has raised over $17 million and sold 1.48 billion tokens in its ongoing presale. IDGN‚Äôs ICO performance demonstrates significant investor trust in IDGN‚Äôs future performance. iDEGEN and its growing popularity iDEGEN is a crypto experiment that leverages the crypto community on X (former Twitter). It utilizes its artificial intelligence capabilities to absorb information, learn, and post on X hourly. Meanwhile, the project‚Äôs harsh and critical posts and replies on the social media site violated X rules, leading to a suspension that X lifted on January 19. iDEGEN takes decentralization to another level.

Their website highlights that IDGN price will soar after presale end Because the crypto lords will raise iDEGEN into a king.

The past six years have seen Trump evolve from bashing and criticizing Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to embracing digital assets and launching his own project and meme coin. While the journey has been rocky, Trump‚Äôs evolution in the market has significantly impacted the industry and will continue to, especially as he is the first pro-crypto U.S. president with several favorable promises for the sector. When Trump Hated BTC Sometime in the third quarter of 2019, CryptoPotato published a report about Trump openly bashing Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies. To quote the U.S. president, he said he was not a fan of cryptocurrencies because they are not money, are highly volatile, and have value based on thin air. Trump insisted that unregulated crypto assets could facilitate unlawful behavior like drug trade and other forms of illicit activity. At the time, Meta Platforms (formerly known as Facebook) was gearing up to launch its cryptocurrency project, Libra. Although the project eventually shut down in 2022 following intense regulatory scrutiny, Trump asserted in 2019 that the cryptocurrency would have little dependability and standing. The POTUS maintained his advocacy for the United States dollar (USD) and even mentioned in mid-2021 that Bitcoin looked like a scam as it competed with the dominant fiat currency. Trump made numerous tweets and statements about his dislike and disregard for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies until he kicked off his presidential campaign in late 2022. Although the U.S. president got a bit involved in the crypto space via non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in the following months, he did not fully embrace Bitcoin until 2024, as the presidential election campaigns became more heated. The U-Turn Noteworthily, Trump‚Äôs pivot to a pro-crypto stance made the headlines in 2024. On numerous occasions, he promised to protect the U.S. digital asset industry from anti-crypto leaders, mine all the remaining bitcoins in the country, and establish a more favorable environment for the budding environment. The U-turn from an anti to a pro-crypto stance swayed OGs and traders in favor of Trump, with industry big names donating and rallying for his victory in the elections. Fortunately, Trump did win, triggering a market surge that saw BTC cross $100,000 for the first time. In addition to embracing the industry, Trump and his family launched World Liberty Financial, a crypto project aimed at empowering everyday people, in September 2024. Two days ago, the POTUS also launched Official Trump (TRUMP), a meme coin that skyrocketed within two days and turned many traders into millionaires overnight. The inauguration that will usher Trump into the White House is set to happen today. As the market has been abuzz with excitement over the weekend, it remains to be seen how well or poorly Trump‚Äôs administration will affect the crypto industry.

Realized volatility is the historical price fluctuations of bitcoin over the past 30 days. It hit 67 on the Bitcoin Volatility Index (BVOL) on Deribit. The Bitcoin Volmex Implied Volatility index (BVIV) hit a high of 71. Implied volatility is the market's expectation for future price fluctuations derived from options pricing. Both indexes are up around 2% on the day. ""The positive correlation between bitcoin's price and implied volatility remains intact. It‚Äôs a sign traders are chasing options, particularly calls, as risk reversals show calls are trading at a premium relative to puts that offer downside protection,"" said Omkar Godbole, a markets analyst and managing editor of markets at CoinDesk In addition, short-duration calls are priced higher than longer-duration ones, a rare occurrence that indicates strong short-term bullish sentiment, according to Andre Dragosch , the European head of research at Bitwise. Open interest in options has increased by 44,000 BTC, reflecting heightened speculative activity, Dragosch noted. Traders are expecting a rapid price gain following President-elect Donald Trump's potential announcement of a strategic bitcoin reserve. Trump's ""influential use of social media, which has historically moved markets, is adding to the uncertainty surrounding the next few days,"" suggests Mitch Galer, a trader at GCR.

Navigating the complexities of the crypto market it‚Äôs easier said than done. It can be an overwhelming task to sift through hundreds of projects to pick those that can yield the biggest returns. Ripple (XRP) and Polkadot (DOT) have already solidified their positions in the market and will likely see massive rallies at the height of the 2025 bull run. However, a new contender has entered the arena: Elluminex (ELX). Offering an innovative DeFi framework on the rapidly growing Toncoin blockchain, Elluminex could soon emerge as a dark horse and take everyone by surprise. Let‚Äôs dive deeper into what each of these projects brings to the table, and why Elluminex might be the true golden ticket. Elluminex: The DeFi Pioneer On Toncoin While the DeFi landscape might be oversaturated, Elluminex sets itself apart from the competition as the first-ever project to leverage the powerful TON Ton Coin blockchain. Elluminex taps into an underdeveloped DeFi niche, bringing a unique solution to the 950-million Telegram user base. The premise is very simple: habitual Telegram users are most likely to opt for a platform tailored specifically to interface with their most-used messaging app. In addition to this, Elluminex offers an innovative cross-chain bridge, enabling near-instantaneous transactions between isolated blockchains. This means that Elluminex is the last DEX crypto traders and holders will ever need. Moreover, this framework also addresses the typical inefficiencies of single-chain platforms as they source liquidity from a variety of chains. This results in reduced waiting times and low slippage, allowing users to capture every opportunity without incurring exorbitant transaction fees. One of the standout features of Elluminex is its focus on user autonomy, ensuring that stakeholders have full control over their assets without relying on intermediaries. This is a key differentiator from centralized platforms that have eroded user trust in recent years. Elluminex is also incorporating a native $ELX token that powers staking, governance, and other ecosystem features. With projected staking rewards as high as 18% APY, Elluminex offers attractive incentives for early adopters while promoting long-term engagement. As the project gears up for its presale, paying attention to Elluminex‚Äôs social media presence and official website could be a winning strategy, as early buyers will have the opportunity to scoop up $ELX tokens at a discounted price. Ripple Faces Turbulence, Will The Stablecoin Launch Reverse The Trend? Currently, the Ripple (XRP) price is experiencing significant volatility amid the broader market decline. After overcoming regulatory challenges, particularly the infamous legal battle with the SEC, XRP has experienced a triple-digit price surge, with recent highs reaching around $2.84. However, as the downturn began, many of Ripple‚Äôs gains were claimed by the market, and today, XRP trades at $2.24 with a 10% daily decrease. However, on the fundamental level, Ripple is stronger than ever. Just the other day, Ripple‚Äôs highly-anticipated native stablecoin RLUSD was released, placing Ripple at the forefront of the stablecoin industry, which is projected to reach $3 trillion in valuation by 2028. This in turn has revamped sentiment within the Ripple community, which will inevitably translate into massive returns once the market finds its footing again, with some speculators projecting a reclaim of the 2018 all-time high of $3.84 by the end of Q1 2025. Polkadot Is Resting On Crucial Support, Will It Hold? Polkadot (DOT) is facing strong headwinds as it lost nearly 23% in valuation over the last week alone. Amid the market-wide surge, Polkadot rode Bitcoin‚Äôs coattails, peaking at $11.57 in early December. Shortly after, as the short-term trend shifted back to bearish, Polkadot saw much of these gains evaporate and is now flirting with the $7 support level. This is where Polkadot bulls must focus their efforts to contain the disruption, otherwise, a drop to the pre-Trump levels below $6 shouldn‚Äôt be ruled out. On the macro level, things are looking better for Polkadot. Luca has drawn attention to Polkadot‚Äôs current chart formation, which projects a surge above $12 in early 2025. This means that market players who bid today will likely see predictable gains relatively soon. However, with its magnitudes lower market cap, Elluminex has the potential to provide comparatively greater returns, while simultaneously unlocking Toncoin‚Äôs dormant DeFi capabilities.

Just last week, the incoming president of the United States, Donald Trump created a meme coin. And guess what? The effects were mind-blowing. The TRUMP meme coin is pumping and creating a Solana surge along with it. While this coin has taken the stage, it has not taken expert eyes off the new coin, Remittix. With a new 30% surge in its ICO, experts are saying that Remittix is set to rip through the charts. Now, whales are taking some profits off their TRUMP bag and rotating into Remittix. Amidst the Remittix attention and surge, Cardano loses momentum with an aim for the bottom. TRUMP Coin Boosts Solana The TRUMP meme coin was launched on Solana in the early hours of January 18, 2025. It all started when Donald Trump tweeted, ‚ÄúMy NEW Official Trump Meme is HERE! It‚Äôs time to celebrate everything we stand for: WINNING! Join my very special Trump Community. GET YOUR $TRUMP NOW‚Äù. Now, the TRUMP meme coin has a market cap of over $50B with more promises for the future. Also, the liquidity flow to Solana has not gone unnoticed with Solana hitting an all-time high of $270 while tokens like Cardano starting to decline. While there is so much buzz, experts are not taking their eyes off the bag. This is cryptocurrency after all and unrealized profit is not yet profit. This has prompted some top traders to accrue some Solana profits and invest in other trending coins. Word on the chain is that Remittix might be the main breakout coin in 2025 and traders are not oblivious to this fact. Cardano Loses ground With more faith and liquidity in the TRUMP meme coin on Solana and emerging coins like Remittix, Cardano and some other tokens are beginning to look bleak. The future doesn‚Äôt look rosy after all as traders are sure to dump Cardano for greener pastures, or should we say greener coins. Recently, Cardano released node v.10.1.4. This node is said to block problematic transactions and enhance its security network. This news offered an initial boost in the Cardano ADA price but this effect has begun to dwindle with each passing day. Although Cardano continues to invent new ways to better serve their users, it seems their upgrades are not enough. Now, this begs the question, will Cardano survive these trying times with liquidity rotating so fast? Experts advise traders not to wait to find out. Remittix ICO Gains with Trump Bonus Amidst the Solana surge, Remittix ICO picks up speed with a 30% bonus from the recent hype. For traders who missed TRUMP on Solana, RTX represents another chance to hop on a life-changing opportunity. RTX is the native token of Remittix, a payment network that links traditional payment systems to the blockchain. With a seamless framework, Remittix allows you to send money all over the world with decentralized finance. This technology, referred to as Payfi, creates a perfect connection between fiat and crypto. Also, Remittix supports over 40 different cryptocurrencies including Solana and ETH with no hidden charges or conditions. In terms of security, Remittix features an advanced encryption framework that protects all transactions and personal information. Conclusion With RTX price at $0.0221, Remittix looks destined for the top. While the TRUMP meme coin might be at the center stage of the Solana surge, Remittix is setting the bar for new and emerging coins. To be a part of this groundbreaking venture, Remittix invites traders and experts to join its public presale which is set to raise $36M. With a projection of a 800% price jump at the end of the presale, Remittix might just be the alpha everyone needs for 2025.

These are the official cryptocurrencies of the soon-to-be 47th US president, Donald Trump, and the first lady in waiting, Melania Trump. These have taken over the market with heavy demand, high price trajectories, and trading volume. However, these Trump-family meme coins also faced volatility and significant drops, leading to concerns about their long-term performance. Let‚Äôs see where these tokens will stand by January‚Äôs end. TRUMP and MELANIA Meme Coin Enter Market With Boom Donald Trump‚Äôs official TRUMP meme coin entered the market on January 17 and surged 3500% within a day. The surge continued until today, creating an ATH of $75.35 with high demand and trading volume. The TRUMP token is still highly bullish, trading at $57.47 with $51.90 billion in trading volume, up by 250% and counting. Not only will Donald Trump become the first sitting US President with meme coin holdings , but he has also launched his own meme-themed cryptocurrency. While investors are enthusiastic about this, critics have raised concerns about his involvement with a volatile asset. MELANIA meme coin followed up soon and presented a similar bullish rally. Within hours of launch, MELANIA flipped the TRUMP coin , reaching an ATH at $13.73. However, the volatility soon took over, causing a sharp correction, currently trading at $10.92. Donald Trump‚Äôs launch of a meme-themed cryptocurrency was a monumental decision before Inauguration Day. The crypto community is now watching these tokens‚Äô further performance, but there is still a fear of a crash. TRUMP and MELANIA Memecoin Price Prediction For January End The performance of the TRUMP and MELANIA meme coins is still parallel to their bullishness. However, due to their recent launch, only limited technical factors can be considered for their long-term prediction, especially as the prices of TRUMP and MELANIA face volatility challenges. Despite that, the future looks bright for these cryptocurrencies due to their connection with the elected president and his wife. If Donald Trump‚Äôs inauguration went per investor expectation, and the crypto maintained the bullishness, the TRUMP meme coin price could hit $100 by January end. At the same time, the MELANIA price can hit $30 or higher. However, Trump‚Äôs meme token will certainly have a higher valuation due to its direct attributes with the President. On the other hand, the MELANIA meme coin might maintain its market cap on the higher side. However, this all depends on January 20 and the inauguration day. TRUMP and MELANIA Price Fears Crash With Inauguration Day The close launch of TRUMP and MELANIA meme coin has disrupted the entire crypto market. Many investors came to the front, making millions in profits within hours or days of launch. However, the volatility did hit these meme-themed cryptocurrencies, bringing significant consolidation. Although this is quite common, this can disrupt their entire price trajectories despite becoming the top meme coins of the market. Interestingly, the performance of these TRUMP-themed coins will highly depend on the crypto regulations and soon-to-be President Donald. Considering that three scenarios can take place. If today‚Äôs Trump inauguration event went well, the TRUMP and MELANIA price could rise higher thanks to bullish crypto-related developments. However, these tokens could crash if the inauguration failed to share significant crypto announcements. This will lead to hundreds of holders losing billions, as people have actively bought these tokens in FOMO and hype. The third situation indicates the possibility of a sideways trend, which can happen if the audience becomes desensitized to the news. Overall, the January 20 inauguration could make or break these cryptos, and the entire crypto market will also witness its effects. In the optimistic scenario, the TRUMP meme coin price could hit $100, and MELANIE could jump to $30 by the end of the month. Key Points To Remember From This Post Donald Trump and his wife Melania‚Äôs official meme cryptocurrencies have taken over the crypto market with continuous gains. As the tokens were launched just days ago, higher investor demand has given them a speedy start, but the next few days remain a crucial period, during which consolidations and price drops may take over. The biggest event is Trump‚Äôs inauguration on January 20, which can result in three situations: price rally, crash, or consolidation for the price of the MELANIA and TRUMP meme coin. Moreover, considering these tokens‚Äô high demand, the TRUMP price may reach the $100 mark, and the MELANIA price may reach $30, ending the January price prediction positively. However, these are just speculations for now, and the actual price may vary depending on market conditions.

However, this success has not come without its challenges. As Solana struggles to deal with the congestion caused by an unprecedented (no pun intended) surge in transactions, this Solana Layer-2 solution, Solaxy ($SOLX) , couldn‚Äôt come up at a better time. On 19 January, the $SOL price soared to a new all-time high above $290 and a market cap above $128B in direct relationship to the mania around the Trump-family meme coins. Can $TRUMP & $MELANIA Get Along? First came $TRUMP after¬†incoming US president Trump announced his official meme coin on X late on Friday, 17 January. The $TRUMP meme coin attracted massive trading volumes of some $3B over the weekend, reaching its peak at $6B in market cap and $30B in fully diluted value within 24 hours. Trump‚Äôs coin went on to become the third-largest cryptocurrency across all blockchains in terms of market capitalization by Sunday, before suddenly falling back, just as the MELANIA coin launched and started gaining traction. A Tough Act to Follow Like her husband‚Äôs coin before her, $MELANIA shot the lights out, surging over 21,000% and reaching $12B in less than three hours from launch on Sunday, 19 January. Indeed, the two Trump family meme coins sent traffic on Solana ($SOL) through the roof over the weekend. While this helped $SOL generate over $35 million in fees and at least $14 million in revenue, the pre-inauguration surge also led to some of Solana‚Äôs ecosystem applications, like Jito and Phantom reporting technical difficulties and delays . As the pressure on Solana‚Äôs blockchain mounts, a project like Solaxy ( $SOLX ) is in a great position to make its debut. What Is Solaxy? Solaxy is the token powering the first-ever Layer-2 (L2) blockchain built on Solana. The L2 Solana network will tackle the network congestion, scalability issues, and failed transactions we‚Äôve seen during this recent peak trading activity. While the Layer 2 won‚Äôt be ready to take the pressure off during this current TRUMP surge, it will lay the foundation for Solana‚Äôs future expansion. $SOLX is based on Ethereum and aims to tap into the liquidity of Ethereum to enhance Solana, enabling faster, cheaper, and more reliable transactions at a scale previously unseen. The $SOLX token presale launched on December 12, 2024, and has already raised close to $12M ($11.93M). To date, the token price has gone from $0.001 to over $0.0016 ‚Äî a 60% increase, reflecting significant investor interest. With demand for Solana‚Äôs infrastructure only rising, analysts believe Solaxy could reach $0.025 by the end of 2025, offering potential returns of 1,462.5% for presale investors, with even higher gains for the early adopters. Early $SOLX investors also benefit from dynamic staking rewards, currently offering 306% annual returns. The Solaxy network is still under development and is only slated for release later this year, but its promise to address Solana‚Äôs pain points has already attracted marked interest, as its growing community on Telegram and 61K follower count on X testify. Solaxy to Rise 100x? As Solana‚Äôs galaxy of meme coins continues to expand, Solaxy‚Äôs positioning as an L2 project for the meme coin market, along with its attractive early investor rewards, could set it up to become Solana‚Äôs next 100x coin by the year‚Äôs end. However, as with any new cryptocurrency, the risks remain, and you should always do your own research and never invest more than you can afford to lose. This is not financial advice, and while some make billions, others can lose great portions of their savings by betting on meme coins making it big.",Altcoins|Solana,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-01-20 11:51:57

As per the data, the address D5nuZhL.. made the purchase worth $29.86 million. Primarily, the accumulation right ahead of Donald Trump‚Äôs inauguration ceremony underscores market sentiments of bolstered prices ahead, attributable to the pro-crypto Republican‚Äôs win. Further, it‚Äôs also worth mentioning that Dogecoin-backer and American billionaire Elon Musk is set to begin his D.O.G.E. role under Trump‚Äôs presidency. Overall, the whale‚Äôs accumulation in light of these events has supported investor sentiments of price gains ahead.

Analysts now anticipate further gains, with Chainlink eyeing a potential breakout to $30. Market participants remain closely focused on this bullish momentum. The LINK price soared today, outperforming most top altcoins amid optimism sparked by U.S. President-Elect Donald Trump‚Äôs inauguration. His administration, widely regarded as pro-crypto, has fueled a positive sentiment across the market. Bitcoin price reacted strongly, hitting a new all-time high of $109,11 4. This crypto market rally reflects renewed confidence in digital assets under the incoming administration‚Äôs potential crypto-friendly policie s. Investors are shifting focus to prominent cryptocurrencies, including LINK, TRUM, MANIA, and BTC. LINK remains among today‚Äôs top gainers, highlighting growing interest in its utility and potential. Chainlink Price Jumps 10%; Could $30 Be the Next Target? In its recent uptrend, Chainlink has been noted by a crypto analyst , who believes that $30 is possible. The cryptocurrency that is well grounded and has practical applications in the real world has been on the rise in the past few days.

Source: X Chainlink Price Analysis As of Monday, the LINK price hovered at $25.59, recording a notable 40% surge over the past week.

XRP saw another $31 million inflows last week, bringing its total inflows since mid-November 2024 to a staggering $484 million. ‚ÄúThere are small inflows in Stellar of $2.1 million but very little other altcoin activity.‚Äù When looking at regional fund inflows and outflows, it was seen that the USA ranked first with an inflow of 2.099 billion dollars.

During this time, DTX Exchange has impressed many people through its innovation in trading, such as the fact that it has introduced tokenized ETFs to the market, which, according to its description, may open new possibilities for investors to enter these very financial markets. For Ripple and SHIB traders who want to find new avenues into lucrative gain, DTX Exchange is emerging as one of the most hopeful platforms that potentially up to 10,000% upside. This article discusses the next events in Ripple XRP ETF prospects, liquidity for SHIB, and the more casual reasons why the DTX Exchange has become quite an attractive asset. Ripple‚Äôs XRP ETF Prospects and Market Optimism Ripple‚Äôs XRP has seen significant price surges recently, partly due to optimism surrounding potential regulatory changes under the new U.S. administration. There are rumors of an ‚ÄúAmerica-first strategic reserve‚Äù that could prioritize cryptocurrencies like XRP for cross-border payments. The prospect of an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) is also becoming more accurate, with JPMorgan going as far as predicting that retail investors can inject as much as $8 billion into such a fund. This hope keeps XRP holders and traders in a lot of positivity and anticipation of the possibility that Ripple would still be freed from the SEC suit on the optimism of a more favorable regulatory framework. Regardless of the volatility of the price of XRP, its market capitalization still remains remarkably high at $177 billion, depicting the digital asset‚Äôs profound permanence in the timepiece. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Movements and Market Sentiment Shiba Inu (SHIB), known for its meme-inspired origins, has been experiencing a resurgence in market interest. Despite recent price drops, SHIB‚Äôs price has shown resilience, with analysts predicting potential targets up to $0.000083. The SHIB community is fervently working on removing some of its tokens that could shrink the circulating supply, thus creating positive vibes. SHIB remains a contender within the crypto market thanks to the nice market cap of over $12 billion, which attracts both the interest of retail and institutional investors. These price movements usually bother many, especially about the test forthcoming for significant resistance levels. DTX Exchange Is The Future of Tokenized ETFs and Trading Innovation Revolutionizing the trading landscape, DTX Exchange is, with its innovative tokenized ETFs, aimed at having a speed never seen before. Its blockchain ‚ÄúVulcanX‚Äù has already demonstrated a TPS of 200.000 during its testnets, making it the leader in DeFi, so it is said. With a leverage of up to 1,000x, the DTX Exchange becomes a place where everything related to stocks, forex, and ETF trading is, at the same time, an actual financial transaction ecosystem. The combination of unparalleled accessibility, no-KYC policy, and highly advanced trading tools gives DTX the power to become a game-changer for novices and professionals. The width of user count and the collection of contributions amounting to more than $12 million, second to over 300,000 in already wallet addresses, all prepare this DTX to canonize its mainnet shortly with guarantees for early investors in more significant volumes of returns. The current token price of $0.14 is set to increase to $0.16 in the next stage, indicating strong investor confidence. Conclusion DTX Exchange could also be very enticing for serious investors, mainly due to the significant potential upsides, a fast-growing user base, and the forthcoming mainnet launch. If you are a well-seasoned trader or getting into cryptocurrency for the first time, DTX Exchange sounds like an interesting option to swallow, particularly for those willing to bite off the future of ETF and high-speed trading inside cryptos. As the crypto market grows, platforms such as DTX are expected to forge the future of cryptocurrency trading.

Why PEPETO Stands Out Though many memecoins exist, PEPETO‚Äôs method might offer an advantage: Balanced Ecosystem: Offering both fun along practical uses, PEPETO could attract a wide range of people ‚Äí from meme fans to crypto users seeking real applications.

While the SOL token has pulled back from its weekend highs, analysts expect that it has more upside to go. Key catalysts will be its DEX dominance, potential strategic reserves, and the robustness of its DEX ecosystem. Key Reason Why Solana Price Could Surge 12.9x One of the top fundamental reasons why the Solana price could surge by 12.9x or to over $3,300 in the next three months. According to Kook Capital , a popular player on X with over 137k users, the key catalyst for this surge will be Donald Trump. Kook cited leaks that showed that Donald Trump will launch a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and then offer 0% capital gain taxes on crypto investments. He also noted that three more coins will be launched soon, including one on Elon Musk. Other potential Trump coins to come are World Liberty Financial and one offering yields. Insiders are upbeat about SOL price Kook cited insiders who believe that the SOL price could jump by 12.8x in the next three months, pushing its value to $3,300. This move would push Solana‚Äôs market cap to over $1.5 trillion. Trump and Melania Meme Coins to Usher A New Era Solana price will also be boosted by the embrace of meme coins by Donald Trump and Melania Trump. The TRUMP token attracted a valuation of over $10 billion, while the new Melania token is worth almost $2 billion . These are signs that many prominent people and companies will start to launch their official coins. For one, that could be a sign that the Trump administration will not crack down on the meme coin industry. Solana has become the go-to chain for Solana chain for meme coins. Its tokens are now worth almost $30 billion, with other top names being Bonk, Fartcoin, and Pudgy Penguins. Solana DEX Volume Surged to a Record High Meanwhile, Solana‚Äôs network has proven that it can handle big events. Its chain handled over $27.6 billion volume , about a 10th of what NASDAQ handles. It handled $89 billion in the last seven days, bringing the cumulative volume to $769 billion. That is a big event considering that the crypto industry is still in its infancy. The biggest DEX protocols in Solana are the likes of Raydium, Orca, Jupiter, and Meteora. Solana Dex volume Solana Price Analyis: What‚Äôs Next For SOL? The weekly chart shows that the Solana price is in its second consecutive week of gains. It sits at the crucial resistance level at $265, the previous all-time high and the upper side of the cup and handle pattern. C&H is a continuation sign that has a rounded bottom followed by some consolidation. The price target is established by measuring the cup‚Äôs depth and then extrapolating it from its top. In this case, the depth is about 100%, meaning that the SOL price may surge and hit the $535 resistance level soon. Solana price chart The bullish SOL price forecast will end if the coin plunges below the lower side of the handle at $170 will invalidate the bullish view.

With buyers holding the line, Solana might target higher resistance levels, reigniting investors‚Äô optimism. However, failure to maintain $240 would shift the narrative, opening the door to further declines and allowing bearish dominance. Robust Resilience Of Solana Bulls At The $240 Mark Solana‚Äôs bulls have exhibited remarkable strength and resilience in holding the $240 support level, successfully outweighing bearish pressure. Despite the challenges, the price is currently attempting to push toward the $260 level, a clear sign that the bulls are gaining control over the market. This upward movement indicates a change in sentiment, with buying interest intensifying and overshadowing the selling pressure.

The ongoing move toward $260 highlights the positive resolve as traders increasingly target higher price levels. If Solana successfully breaks above the $260 resistance, it might signal the continuation of the uptrend, with the bulls possibly regaining full control and targeting even higher resistance points. This upward movement is backed by increasing buyer confidence, reflected by the bulls‚Äô determination to hold above key support levels. Technical indicators are providing key insights into SOL‚Äôs next potential move. The 4-hour Simple Moving Average (SMA) is currently demonstrating a bullish trend as Solana‚Äôs price remains above this moving average, suggesting continued upward momentum. Also, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has recently risen to 60% after a brief decline to 50%, signaling a shift in market dynamics. This notable increase from 50% to 60% suggests that more buyers are entering the market, strengthening the upward pressure on Solana‚Äôs price. Key Resistance Levels To Watch If Bulls Hold The Line If bulls successfully hold the line and maintain their strength above the $240 support level, the next key resistance level to watch is $260. Looking at the chart, this level is significant as it marks an important hurdle for the bulls to overcome in order to continue their bullish push.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Will Dogecoin break $1 in 2025? As market sentiment improves, XRP and YETIO also capture attention, fueling the buzz around crypto‚Äôs potential this year. Table of Contents Dogecoin: How likely is it for the $1 mark to be achieved? XRP: Institutional interest sparks momentum Yeti Ouro: Blockchain Gaming Reimagined In 2025, the crypto market sentiment has improved. This year, along with Dogecoin (DOGE), XRP and Yeti Ouro (YETIO) emerged as promising contenders. DOGE aims to reach the unprecedented $1 mark, XRP trades flat but remains near its all-time highs, and YETIO pushes the boundaries of innovation within blockchain gaming presales. The inauguration of Trump has signaled a wave of boost in prices for cryptocurrencies as the crypto market begins to pick up. Dogecoin: How likely is it for the $1 mark to be achieved? Trading suspended at $0.418, DOGE price has increased by 27% in the last week, thanks to the renewed popularity of the meme coin driven by correspondent interest under the Trump administration. In continuation, Elon Musk, alongside his support for the crypto-enthused D.O.G.E. department, continues to strengthen market confidence. The current price of Dogecoin exceeds that of its 20-day EMA, which is set at $0.38, hence suggesting a bullish trend for the short term. The price support is at $0.39, while the main resistance level is set at $0.50. If DOGE price breaks this level with strong volume, analysts expect a rally that goes towards $0.75, potentially reaching $1 by the end of the year in a strong bull market. The RSI at 62 indicates that there is room for further upward movement, while the ADX at 28 suggests that trend strengthening is beginning. DOGE‚Äôs rise in social media-driven hype hawking, coupled with Musk‚Äôs soft endorsements, could make 2025 a breakout year. XRP: Institutional interest sparks momentum Ripple‚Äôs XRP asset class is set to become one of the best-performing assets in 2025 as it trades at $3.23 , adjacent to its all-time high of $3.40. XRP price has increased by 40% within the last week due to rising investor confidence and speculation about ETF approvals, which is further fueled by the crypto-friendly government. XRP faces a haunting resistance of $3.40, which, when crossed, may charge it towards $4.20 or even higher. Its price action is supported by good fundamentals. Adoption is increasing, as evidenced by the over 500,000 new wallets in recent months. Whale watch proved lucrative as it surpassed single-day records of high-value transactions from two thousand and three hundred, each exceeding 100,000 thousand dollars. Over 2,300 high-value transactions exceeding $100,000 were recorded in a single day, highlighting whale activity. Yeti Ouro: Blockchain gaming reimagined Yeti Ouro is relatively new and has a specific appeal compared to DOGE and XRP. It has already collected a whopping $1.66 million during presale, proving that the mix between meme coins and utility proves to be successful. Implemented in Unreal Engine, Yeti Ouro has also powered YETIO, a Play-to-Earn (P2E) racing game that has dynamic race conditions driven by AI and vehicles with customizable features. These capabilities foster agile and constant token supply for demand and growth of the ecosystem. There is a fundamental value in YETIO, and unlike other meme coins, Yeti Ouro integrates entertainment with real action. This gives them a strong position in the gaming industry based on the blockchain. These projects mark how cryptocurrencies will be used in the future as 2025 approaches and open the door to wider narratives based on a community or technical prowess. The team shared a video showcasing the first glance at the Level 1 map at a distance. This is a larger area of the map that uses the same death match-style gameplay. Players have a large surface area to avoid attackers and collect power-ups to help them defeat opponents. There is so much detail yet to be shown, with garages for vehicle repairs and upgrades as well as hidden tunnels and harsh terrains to get through.

Solana brings in the most fees Generally, the overall picture for Solana is extremely positive. In just about all measures, Solana is crushing the opposition. DEX volume on the network is streets ahead of any other blockchain and 67% of all transactions are now taking place on Solana. In fees for Sunday, despite being the cheapest, the Solana network brought in $4.7 million, with Ethereum in second place at $2.8 million. Solana literally unusable However, all the action that took place on Solana on Sunday had its cost. The sheer weight of transactions by investors FOMOing into memecoins $TRUMP and $MELANIA caused some serious failures, with eventually 40% of transactions failing. At one point the network was described as ‚Äúliterally unusable‚Äù. With such a deterioration for users leading to criticisms that the much-touted Solana high-transaction throughput network was still not ready for widespread adoption. $SOL huge volatility Source: TradingView The daily chart for $SOL shows the huge volatility that the cryptocurrency is currently experiencing. That said, the breakout from the downtrend has been successful and a daily candle wick has been down to test the 0.618 Fibonacci, which is a healthy sign. It might be expected that the price could get above the previous all-time high at $264, and start to consolidate there. A spike to $295 took place on Sunday. $323 is the level of the 1.618 Fibonacci, which could be the next target. $TRUMP heading for $100? Source: TradingView Only having been launched last Friday, there is not much price action still for $TRUMP. However, given the interest in this memecoin, and having seen a good retrace from the high at $76, down to $37, further upward spikes could certainly take place.

On Sunday, despite offering the lowest fees, Solana generated $4.7 million in fees, surpassing Ethereum, which collected $2.8 million. Solana Becomes Unresponsive The intense activity on Solana this past Sunday came at a cost. The surge in transactions from investors rushing to acquire $TRUMP and $MELANIA memecoins led to significant disruptions, with a failure rate of 40% for transactions.

With Trump‚Äôs inauguration and SEC Chair Gary Gensler‚Äôs resignation, the XRPArmy anticipates an imminent resolution in the Ripple vs SEC case. However, legal experts such as Securities attorney Marc Fagel warn about the Ripple vs SEC case‚Äôs unpredictable nature, predicting a possible 10-month delay. The controversy surrounding Trump‚Äôs token launch has reignited the discussion on the much-awaited XRP lawsuit settlement. Securities Lawyer Predicts 10-Month Delay in Ripple vs SEC Case In an X post , Marc Fagel emphasized the uncertain nature of the Ripple vs SEC case, positing that the case could be further prolonged to 10 months. He has also commented on the possibility of a sooner settlement under the Trump government if the new SEC Chair Paul Atkins opts to drop the appeal. The discussion began with Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett‚Äôs post on Trump‚Äôs TRUMP token. While Eric Trump hailed the TRUMP coin as the ‚Äúhottest digital meme on earth,‚Äù Fagel dismissed it as a ‚Äúpyramid scheme.‚Äù NEW: @EricTrump has officially commented on the launch of the $TRUMP token, calling it ‚Äúthe hottest digital meme on earth.‚Äù It‚Äôs real. https://t.co/iAXrFwcnjh ‚Äî Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) January 18, 2025 The conversation quickly escalated into a debate about hot topics, including the Ripple vs SEC case, Elon Musk‚Äôs ongoing battle with the SEC, and the broader implications of crypto regulations. Marc Fagel wrote, Ripple broke the law, as a federal court confirmed. Musk, previously charged with securities fraud and thus a repeat offender, seems to have pretty clearly broken the law. But I guess we just give billionaires and well-financed companies a pass. How Trump‚Äôs Memecoin Will Impact XRP Lawsuit? Following the recent memecoin frenzy triggered by the TRUMP token, XRP lawyers are closely examining the potential outcome of the XRP lawsuit. For instance, attorney Bill Morgan raised concerns over the memecoin‚Äôs impact, urging Congress to adopt clearer crypto guidelines. At the same time, pro-XRP advocate John Deaton emphasized his preference for memecoin regulations over other concerns like SAB 121, CFTC oversight, and tax reform. Ripple Lawsuit‚Äôs Broader Impact on Crypto Market The Ripple vs SEC case conclusion could have a broader impact on the crypto market, especially in the regulatory landscape. Ripple‚Äôs win over the SEC could establish a legal precedent for other¬†cryptocurrencies, clarifying digital assets as non-securities. However, if Ripple loses to the SEC, it could usher in a stricter regulatory environment, posing significant challenges for cryptocurrencies.

XRP is trading at $3.18 after a 25.7% surge over the past week, and EGRAG CRYPTO‚Äôs latest post highlights the growing potential of the digital asset. His analysis from 2023 is centered on Fibonacci projections, with the 1.618 Fib level indicating a $10 price target and the 2.618 Fib level pointing toward $124. According to him, history may repeat itself, and XRP could achieve these targets, especially as it remains one of the few cryptocurrencies with regulatory clarity . He believes reaching the $10 target will be a breeze for XRP, and the $124 level is the clear roadmap for the asset, suggesting a long-term climb to this ambitious target. #Reposting : This is one of the simplest yet most illustrative charts. When #XRP was at $0.40, only a few OGs were eyeing the high targets. If we break through the $10 mark, holding #XRP below $1 will position you among the visionaries and gurus. How many times have we said‚Ä¶ https://t.co/JatNlDXdEN ‚Äî EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) January 18, 2025 XRP‚Äôs Superiority to Other Digital Assets In his June 2023 post , EGRAG CRYPTO stated that ‚ÄúXRP might be the only crypto with legal clarity,‚Äù a reference to the regulatory challenges faced by other cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. Since his post, Ripple has secured multiple favorable rulings in its legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including a ruling that XRP is not a security and non-institutional XRP sales are not securities offerings. This distinction, he argues, sets XRP apart in the digital asset landscape. He also noted that the outlined targets are grounded in technical analysis, historical patterns, and trading principles. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Why You Should Hold XRP In his recent post, EGRAG CRYPTO encouraged early adopters to recognize the opportunity presented by XRP trading below $1, calling it a potential path to ‚Äúgenerational wealth.‚Äù His post stressed the importance of holding XRP through pivotal price points like $10, reaffirming his belief in the asset‚Äôs long-term value. He noted that once the asset breaks through the $10 level, those who were wise enough to buy XRP at $1 will be among the ‚Äúvisionaries and gurus.‚Äù At the time of his analysis in 2023, XRP was trading below $0.5, but EGRAG CRYPTO and many in the community had faith in the asset. Now it has crossed $3, and many believe it will never come down again. The analyst added, ‚ÄúIf anyone DMs me asking whether to buy XRP at $2.80, $2.70, or any other price, I will block them.‚Äù After years of convincing investors to buy low, the time has come for those who invested early to reap their rewards. Another well-respected crypto figure recently stated that he will not sell his XRP below $100 , and EGRAG CRYPTO‚Äôs target of $124 suggests the asset would climb much higher.

In a recent‚ÄÇpost on X, Ki noted how Trump‚Äôs launch of TRUMP capitalizes on the retail investing trend that continues to dominate, turning speculative fervor into a potent force. With the advent of the Official TRUMP ( TRUMP ) token, which launched on Jan. 18, Trump is moving forward with speculation on retail-driven crypto markets to secure profits by leveraging his enormous fan base. Trump Opened the Era of Meme Coins For retail investors, financial markets have always been about chasing memes. Following trends is nothing new‚Äîit‚Äôs just how they‚Äôve always operated. Even the decades-long mantra of ‚Äúinvest in the S&P 500‚Äù that many followed for their pensions‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) January 20, 2025 Retail investors have always pumped‚ÄÇmoney into financial market trends, and decades of ‚Äúinvesting in the S&P 500‚Äù is like investing in meme coins, Ki argued. Now, the retail investor plays the game as hype-forming influencers are followed, trends are replicated, and entrepreneurs are idolized, aided by platforms such as Robinhood and crypto exchanges, which facilitate active participation. He says the Official Trump coin is the perfect representation of this story, which is heavily aided by an army of‚ÄÇTrump believers. As opposed to traditional investments, Ki said,‚ÄÇthe celebrity meme coins ‚Äî such as TRUMP ‚Äî does not create direct value. Their value instead comes from their‚ÄÇpower of community-building. He said Trump‚Äôs coin probably won‚Äôt tank until he pulls the rug from underneath with his avid fan base. Many others within the crypto community, however, believe that a rug pull might not be in the cards for the Trump token which has a market cap of 45 billion, as per CoinMarketCap .

The pro-free-market approach under Trump will mean little regulation. This means dozens of meme coin communities can experiment their fate over the next four years, until 2028. However, Ki has cautioned that although these meme coins have the potential to promote goodwill and innovation, they‚ÄÇcould also be used by malicious groups. One such example was seen in the case of the Hawk Tuah meme coin, which crashed 88% in 20 minutes in December.

Dogecoin: From Meme to Mainstream ‚Äì Is DOGE the Next Big Crypto Bet? Dogecoin started as a joke in 2013, featuring the Shiba Inu meme as its logo. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it was a fun alternative to other cryptocurrencies. Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin has no supply limit and produces 10,000 new coins every minute. Initially a ‚Äúmemecoin,‚Äù it surged in 2021. Social media buzz and Elon Musk‚Äôs endorsements propelled it into the top ten cryptocurrencies, with a market cap over $50 billion. This rise showed the power of community and social media in finance. Despite its humorous beginnings, Dogecoin has potential. It offers fast transactions with low fees, making it user-friendly. In today‚Äôs market, as investors look beyond traditional coins, DOGE stands out for its community and accessibility. While it lacks Bitcoin‚Äôs scarcity or Ethereum‚Äôs smart contracts, its popularity makes it appealing. As the crypto market evolves, Dogecoin could be attractive for diversification. Its mix of fun and utility might keep it in the spotlight. PEPE: The Frog Meme That Took the Crypto World by Storm PEPE is a deflationary memecoin launched on the Ethereum blockchain as a tribute to the iconic Pepe the Frog meme created by Matt Furie. Embracing the spirit of simplicity, PEPE stands out by having no tax policy and openly acknowledging its lack of utility, appealing to enthusiasts who appreciate the pure meme essence. In a remarkable surge between late April and May 2023, PEPE‚Äôs market cap soared to an astonishing $1.6 billion. This explosive growth not only minted millionaires but also ignited a ‚Äúmemecoin season,‚Äù with countless new meme-based cryptocurrencies experiencing wild rides of sudden spikes and drops. The project‚Äôs roadmap is ambitious, outlining plans across three phases that include listings on major exchanges like CoinMarketCap and aiming for a ‚Äúmeme takeover.‚Äù While PEPE doesn‚Äôt offer technological innovations like some other cryptocurrencies, its strength lies in its vibrant community and the power of internet culture. In the current market cycle, with the anticipated Bitcoin halving and hopes for a bull run, PEPE captures the speculative excitement that drives many meme coins. Whether it will reach new heights remains uncertain, but it undeniably highlights the unpredictable and spirited nature of the crypto landscape. BONK‚Äôs Big Leap: A Meme Coin Revolution on Solana BONK is shaking up the crypto world. With a cute Shiba Inu mascot, this memecoin on the Solana blockchain aims to give power back to the community, taking it from big investors. After a Coinbase listing, BONK‚Äôs value more than doubled. It gave away half its coins to active members in Solana‚Äôs NFT and DeFi spaces to build a loyal following. Despite its surge, BONK faces challenges. Its huge supply can impact price. Memecoins are unpredictable, and BONK is no different. But its role in Solana‚Äôs growing ecosystem is promising. The launch of BonkSwap, a decentralized exchange, shows its innovative push. In today‚Äôs market, BONK stands out as an interesting player. Whether it‚Äôs a good buy now depends on your risk level and belief in its future.

While established players like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Litecoin (LTC) show resilience and are poised to deliver more gains, DTX Exchange (DTX), a new gem, is on the horizon, offering massive growth potential. Given their respective utilities, experts suggest this could be the final chance to secure these prospective altcoins before they hit new highs. Dogecoin, known for its cult-like following, is gaining traction, while Litecoin remains a top altcoin among crypto traders. Meanwhile, DTX Exchange emerges as a game-changer that blends advanced tech with utility. Dogecoin (DOGE) Could Deliver More Gains Soon Everyone‚Äôs favorite meme coin, Dogecoin (DOGE), is again stealing the spotlight with an electrifying surge that has captivated investors worldwide. In the past months, crypto whales made bold moves, amassing a staggering 200 million DOGE worth an estimated $83 million , signaling massive confidence in the coin‚Äôs future potential. Currently priced at $0.42 , DOGE has seen an impressive 12% jump in the last 24 hours and a jaw-dropping 25% increase in just a week. With a market cap of $61 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of around $6 billion, Dogecoin has outpaced its peers, reaffirming its position as a powerhouse in the crypto space. The recent surge highlights growing interest in DOGE‚Äôs long-term potential, driven by strategic moves from major players. Investors can get involved with Dogecoin now as it sets its sights towards $1. Litecoin (LTC) Gears Up for a Bullish Breakout Litecoin is another altcoin that could break out soon after a period of consolidation in its price action. Despite a recent resistance rejection, the technical indicators suggest a major rebound is on the horizon. LTC has reached the lower bands of the Bollinger Bands, signaling reduced volatility and a likely price squeeze. Adding fuel to this bullish outlook, its technical analysis shows signs of a potential upward rally. Analysts predict that LTC could soon break free from the falling wedge pattern, establishing a new resistance zone at $140. With market dynamics expected to shift as we continue in this new quarter, Litecoin‚Äôs price could surge beyond $135, marking a pivotal moment for the token. Investors looking to invest in LTC can do so at this current price action. DTX Exchange (DTX) is a New Gem That Could Revolutionize Crypto Trading DTX Exchange wraps up the altcoin list as a game-changing platform that could simplify crypto trading for retail and institutional investors. With support for over 100,000 currency pairs, including crypto, stocks, forex, and more, this asset is poised to redefine how investors interact with the financial market. Powered by its ultra-fast VulcanX blockchain, DTX guarantees lightning-speed transactions, capable of handling over 200,000 transactions per second. This functionality and performance enhance retail investors‚Äô access while boosting operational efficiency. DTX Exchange also introduces other key features, like governance rights, where token holders influence future products. A profit-sharing rebate program further sweetens the deal for participants. DTX Exchange‚Äôs fair launch strategy and wildly successful presale, which has raised over $12 million, demonstrate its strong market reception. Early adopters already enjoy over 600% returns, with the presale price at just $0.14 per token. The platform‚Äôs advanced tools, including 1,000x leverage and the Phoenix Wallet for secure asset custody, make it a one-stop destination for crypto enthusiasts. With its full launch scheduled for the first quarter of 2025, DTX could challenge established players and set new standards in trading. Early participation could lead to substantial gains as the platform continues to gain momentum. Final Verdict The crypto market is buzzing with opportunities, and this week‚Äôs top picks could be your gateway to life-changing returns. Among them, Dogecoin, Litecoin, and DTX Exchange are must-watch tokens. These projects are perfectly positioned to thrive in their respective sectors, making now the perfect time to invest before their values skyrocket. As the race heats up, experts predict that DTX Exchange could be prominent in terms of gains, with forecasts reaching up to 100x returns this year.

Bitcoin technicals are highly bullish as the cryptocurrency soared from $99K to $109K in a matter of hours. Bitcoin (BTC) achieved a new all-time high of $109,114.88 earlier today, briefly reclaiming a valuation of $2.15 trillion.

39220579,https://invezz.com/?p=2459823,1737380057,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Predictions show Solana price will reach $420 by Jan 31 as new $0.175 coin emerges as top crypto to watch,https://invezz.com/news/2025/01/20/predictions-show-solana-price-will-reach-420-by-jan-31-as-new-0-175-coin-emerges-as-top-crypto-to-watch/,"The cryptocurrency market heated up at the beginning of 2025, with Solana (SOL) indicating a strong possibility of a big rally. In addition, Rexas Finance (RXS), an emerging coin at $0.175, is quickly gaining popularity as the next top crypto. These two projects have massive potential but differ in several ways, making them interesting prospects for people who wish to earn money in the bull market. Solana (SOL): aiming for a massive breakout Solana started on a strong footing, trading at $204.11 and reaching a market capitalization of $98.72 billion during the year‚Äôs opening month. Market indicators support this bullish perception as Solana prices have consistently shown resilience and growth. The weekly chart displays a rounding bottom pattern that confirms optimism; it usually indicates the end of the downtrend and the start of the new bullish trend. Experts predict SOL will surpass its previous peak of $264. According to estimates, it could jump as high as $420 by January 31, driven by robust investor demand and the rapid expansion of its ecosystem. Solana maintains dominance in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) markets due to its low transaction costs, which developers prefer over other platforms for such purposes. Additionally, the platform has become a preferred choice for institutional clients due to its blazing-fast network and energy-efficient system, making it a green alternative to Ethereum and other older blockchain networks. As more institutional investors adopt the currency, it will likely lead to a further price increase. Therefore, it can be argued that Solana could exhibit significant gains in 2025. Rexas Finance (RXS): a game changer There are promising signs that the Solana network will soon experience rapid growth that will attract more investors. However, Rexas Finance may be an ideal investment opportunity for long-term gains. At $0.175, RXS became the first token to provide real-world asset tokenization and allow access to high-value investments like real estate. The ongoing presale has been hugely successful, raising over $36.6 million and selling 400 million tokens. Initially valued at $0.03, this coin has maintained its upward trajectory throughout, displaying healthy demand forces in the market. Because of its model, these features make it one of the major game changers in the blockchain industry. Tokenization of real-world assets Rexas Finance emphasizes using blockchain technology to make physical assets available tokenized. RXS allows people to own fractions of high-end properties by tokenizing them as real estate assets. This shift makes markets previously out of reach accessible to normal investors, thus promoting fairness within the sectors. Moreover, blockchain ensures transparency and security since all transactions are immutably recorded on this platform, increasing its attractiveness among worldwide users who prefer digitalization in their operations. As global economies undergo digital transformations, Rexas Finance stands strategically placed to ride this wave, making it an exciting investment opportunity for next year‚Äôs portfolio. CertiK audit and listings Rexas Finance has undergone a CertiK audit to ensure the platform meets the highest security standards. This independent verification increases investor confidence by protecting funds and maintaining ecosystem integrity. Additionally, RXS is listed on popular platforms such as CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, increasing its exposure and credibility. These listings help interested investors track coin performance and participate in its appreciation. Community engagement and giveaway Rexas Finance has introduced a $1 million giveaway to expand its reach and build a dedicated community. Twenty winners will each receive $50,000 worth of RXS tokens. This initiative rewards early adopters, builds trust, and fosters engagement among the user base. Participation is simple: visit the official website of Rexas Finance, complete tasks such as following the project on social networks, and submit entries. Transparency in selecting winners ensures fairness and adds credibility to the initiative. Buying RXS Obtaining RXS coins is straightforward for investors. Tokens can be purchased directly through the ongoing presale event on the Rexas Finance website. Users can buy tokens at the current price by connecting their wallets and using popular cryptocurrencies like Ethereum or Tether (USDT). The presale recently ended, so now is the time to acquire RXS before it lists on major exchanges. Unlike other cryptocurrencies that are primarily speculative, Rexas Finance provides real utility. Its tokenization model addresses concrete problems, attracting both individual and institutional investors. In 2025, the coin‚Äôs steady presale performance and innovative approach to real estate asset ownership give it a solid chance for significant growth. Market optimism continues to build, making Solana and Rexas Finance two interesting cryptocurrencies. Solana‚Äôs bullish technical indicators and expanding ecosystem suggest the potential for substantial short-term gains. Meanwhile, Rexas Finance, with its strong presale performance and innovative tokenization model, stands out as a leading contender for long-term growth. For individuals seeking immediate returns or long-term value, these two virtual currencies provide compelling investment opportunities in the ever-evolving blockchain technology space.

This has put a stamp on the growing market shift as new tokens emerge to compete with the older ones. The milestone proves that more investors are getting interested in the $TRUMP coin, as well as its performance in the past several days. However, since then the $TRUMP coin has retraced and is now ranking as the 3rd largest memecoin. Over the past 24 hours, the $TRUMP coin‚Äôs value has skyrocketed by an impressive 169.16%, reaching $65. This rise was supported by a massive jump in trading volume of 328.69% to $25.23 billion. The trading volume of the coin stands at $47 billion, while the market capitalization now stands at $13.06 billion, proving the investors‚Äô confidence and positive market direction. Shiba Inu The price for Shiba Inu (SHIB) went down by 6.05% in the same 24-hour period. The token‚Äôs value has currently risen to $0.00002163 . Despite this, trading volume increased by 15% to $992 million, which is an indication that there was still trading going on in the market even after the price drop. The market capitalization of Shiba Inu has fallen to $12.74 billion, making it a difficult day for the previous leading cryptocurrency. The $TRUMP coin has risen sharply in value after its introduction by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Originally, $TRUMP was launched as a meme coin, but it was able to amass a market capitalization in the billions demonstrating its mass adoption. Rising interest from the market ahead of Trump‚Äôs inauguration as the 47th President of the United States on Monday has also contributed to pushing up the token‚Äôs price.

These figures point to market confidence, with states like Wyoming and Massachusetts exploring Bitcoin reserves. However, the debut of Trump‚Äôs meme coin is grabbing attention too, hinting that political circles could be warming to digital assets. If regulators follow suit, Bitcoin might have a smoother ride ahead. Meanwhile, a project called Remittix has raised over $3.7 million in its Remittix presale , offering an alternative. Observers wonder if BTC could reach $250K this cycle. Why Trump‚Äôs Meme Coin Could Suggest Softer Regulation The launch of Trump‚Äôs meme coin, ‚ÄúOfficial Trump,‚Äù marks a surprising turnaround for someone once critical of crypto. Many believe this shift might signal a broader easing of regulatory pressures in the United States. When politicians embrace digital tokens, it can push policymakers to treat them as emerging technologies rather than gambling. This atmosphere bodes well for Bitcoin, which already draws institutional interest from giants like BlackRock and others. If Washington loosens rules, more banks and hedge funds might funnel capital into BTC, boosting its trajectory. Such an environment could remove uncertainty and encourage mainstream adoption, fueling Bitcoin‚Äôs continued climb. Could Bitcoin Really Hit $250K? With Bitcoin hovering around $104.65K and states like Oklahoma considering strategic reserves, some predict the coin could soar to $250K this cycle. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have already attracted over $1.3 billion in inflows, indicating surging demand. Major financial hubs from Switzerland to Massachusetts are exploring deeper BTC involvement, underscoring broadening acceptance. Still, no bull run is guaranteed. A sudden rate hike or unexpected policy shift might dampen optimism. Even so, many see a turning point for Bitcoin, given its track record of defying skeptics. If these supportive trends continue, hitting that $250K target may be less far-fetched than once imagined. Remittix Presale: A Quiet Contender Amid the spotlight on big-name tokens and meme coins, Remittix (RTX) has been steadily attracting interest with its Remittix presale, now raised over $3.7 million. Unlike speculative projects, Remittix aims to streamline cross-border transactions, converting crypto into fiat for faster, cheaper transfers. This practical focus resonates with investors who appreciate tangible value over fleeting hype. If Remittix succeeds, it could carve out a niche in the massive remittance market, which handles trillions annually. While it lacks Bitcoin‚Äôs brand power, the project might stand on solid ground if mainstream demand for frictionless payments grows. If you‚Äôre curious, check the presale online. Balancing Hype with Reality Crypto markets thrive on hype, but they also reward real innovations. If Trump‚Äôs meme coin suggests looser regulations, Bitcoin could keep climbing, feeding speculation that $250K is within reach. Yet traders should remember that policy shifts and macroeconomic events can strike without warning. Even established projects like BTC face headwinds if the SEC suddenly flips its stance. Meanwhile, upstarts such as Remittix (RTX) show how solving tangible problems might foster sustainable growth. It all boils down to tracking both fundamentals and market sentiment. Big whales and retail FOMO can spike prices overnight, but only lasting utility cements a crypto‚Äôs position. Merging the Hype with Real-World Value Bitcoin‚Äôs quest for $250K hinges on multiple factors, from state-level reserves to potential regulation shifts hinted at by Trump‚Äôs meme coin. If policymakers relax their stance, institutional inflows could boost BTC even higher. Still, any abrupt economic downturn or policy U-turn might derail bullish targets. Meanwhile, Remittix (RTX), with its remittance approach, proves there‚Äôs room for faces focused on real-world solutions. Whether you‚Äôre betting on Bitcoin‚Äôs rocket ride, dabbling in meme tokens, or exploring the Remittix presale, staying flexible remains crucial in a market famed for surprises.

This comes at a time when ETH prices are being traded within a narrow range, and tokens are being sold by the Foundation. Nevertheless, with hours away from Donald Trump‚Äôs inauguration ceremony, chances are that ETH prices will organically navigate their way for an uptick. ETH Staking by Ethereum Foundation Under Consideration Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, has emphasized through an X post that the Ethereum Foundation is reviewing ETH staking options. He has said that two factors were originally hampering plans of ETH staking, namely regulatory concerns and self-staking. If the Ethereum Foundation engages in ETH staking itself, it will have to take a position on the future contentious hard fork. Concerns around regulations are not strong anymore as the Trump Administration is likely to form effective regulations and frameworks for the industry. This will pave the way for ETH staking if the Foundation finds a way to resolve concerns around self-staking. This is something that Vitalik believes can be minimized in several ways but has not written them in detail. Vitalik published this post to respond to a user‚Äôs query who sought clarification about how easily could the Ethereum Foundation stake ETH and use DeFi to cover most of its internal budget. ETH Selling by Ethereum Foundation Meanwhile, a report by Lookonchain has highlighted that the Ethereum Foundation has sold an additional 100 ETH tokens. These are collectively worth approximately $336k and now account for the total selling of 4,666 Ether tokens at the price of $13.3 million since Jan 2, 2024. The Ethereum Foundation previously sold 100 ETH at approximately $336k on Jan 8, taking its total selling to 4,566 ETH for a value of $12.96 million at that time. Another notable sale by the Foundation was reported on Dec 20, when the same number of tokens were sold, and ETH had dipped by almost 17%. The latest ETH sale is speculated to have happened because the TRUMP meme coin went on Solana instead of Ethereum. Bullish Rally Ahead? ETH price is up by 2.98% over the past 24 hours, listed at $3,304.41. There are reasons for ETH to skyrocket to $7,000 . Ethereum MVRV pricing bands indicator by Glassnode, for one, hints that there could be repricing, which fuels the upward trajectory for ETH, the second largest crypto based on market cap. Also, Donald Trump‚Äôs inauguration ceremony is only hours away. This event will officially kickstart his crypto-friendly administration and pro-crypto candidates assuming their respective offices like Paul Atkins as the SEC Chair. The launch of TRUMP and MELANIA meme coins has also strengthened the interest of investors in the crypto sphere. Both meme coins have gained significant value since their launch and continue to add to their market capitalization.

Critics are accusing him of orchestrating a rug pull that caused the coin‚Äôs value to plummet from a high of $90 million to about $5 million. Fournier Defends His Actions Fournier tried to explain the situation in a Sunday night post on X, saying he had been approached by an individual, identified as ‚ÄúAsta‚Äù in online discussions, who wanted to create a coin supporting TikTok‚Äôs comeback to the United States. ‚ÄúI said screw it and let‚Äôs do it,‚Äù the Trump supporter expounded in another post. He subsequently received 50% of the supply of the meme coin, dubbed TIKTOK, and watched as its value soared to unimaginable heights. At one point, according to a screenshot shared by a user of the social media platform, Fournier‚Äôs TIKTOK stash was worth more than $19 million, with the meme coin‚Äôs price skyrocketing nearly 18,000%. However, as the price started to drop, the conservative campaigner decided to cut his losses, swapping 505 million tokens for about $700,000 worth of SOL. Following the episode, which Fournier described as a ‚Äúchaotic mess,‚Äù an X user accused him of rugging the project, with the 29-year-old blaming his naivety for the debacle. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very new to crypto and I promise you I didn‚Äôt rug it,‚Äù he replied. Community Reacts When challenged to explain his actions by another user, he claimed his decision to sell was driven by fear after he saw the coin‚Äôs price going down. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to sell,‚Äù he responded. ‚ÄúBut I ended up having to sell when it kept dropping.‚Äù Still, that clarification did not stop the criticism, with many accusing Fournier of deliberately draining liquidity from the project. Some pointed to blockchain data, which apparently showed that his sell-off occurred when the coin was relatively stable, suggesting his actions directly caused the price crash. One detractor summarized the situation bluntly: ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs on chain, dude. You can‚Äôt erase where you rugged it.‚Äù The drama comes against a backdrop of heightened meme coin activity spearheaded by the launch of Donald Trump‚Äôs official token, followed by another from his wife, Melania. During a certain period, Trump‚Äôs meme coin attained a market value of $15 billion, eclipsing Pepe (PEPE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). However, the introduction of Melania‚Äôs coin rocked the boat somewhat, causing TRUMP to dump 50% of its value and wiping out billions across the broader crypto market.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Rollblock aims to disrupt online gambling in 2025, positioning itself as a potential 100x gem in crypto, outshining SHIB and PEPE. Table of Contents Why Rollblock is a gamechanger Shiba Inu struggles to regain momentum Pepe shows weakness, slips 10% Conclusion Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe (PEPE) made waves in the crypto world and experienced memorable rallies, minting their fair share of millionaires along the way. Experts believe that Rollblock (RBLK) will pick up the torch next, as investor focus is shifting toward utility-driven projects. Rollblock is a web3 casino that could disrupt the online gambling space, and with the crypto gaming narrative expected to ramp up in 2025, this newcomer is uniquely positioned to become the next 100x gem. Why Rollblock is a gamechanger Rollblock is changing the online casino industry with its cutting-edge GambleFi platform, combining high-end security, an intriguing reward system, and explosive growth potential. Over 40,000 early adopters have joined the successful presale of the native RBLK token, which has already amassed over $8.8 million in funds. Rollblock offers an extensive game library, boasting over 7,000 titles ranging from classics like poker and blackjack to exclusive AI-driven games. Furthermore, the platform boasts a newly launched sports betting feature and has announced plans to add more than a dozen games in the coming weeks. In December alone, users wagered over $1.75 million on the platform, highlighting Rollblock‚Äôs growing adoption and viral appeal. The RBLK token plays a central role in the Rollblock ecosystem, powering the payment network and the intriguing rev-share mechanism. Every week the casino will reinvest up to 30% of its earnings to fund buybacks of the RBLK token. 60% of the repurchased RBLK will be burned, while the remaining 40% will be redistributed as staking rewards. This approach grants RBLK holders a two-fold benefit of passive income and scarcity-driven appreciation. Shiba Inu struggles to regain momentum Shiba Inu has slipped out of the top 15 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, with its price stalling due to increased selling activity. Currently trading around $0.00021, Shiba Inu has dipped below the $0.000022 support level, following a 6% intraday decrease. Shiba Inu‚Äôs daily RSI is falling as well, now sitting at 45 points, indicating weakening price action, which could mean that further downside could be in store. This lack of strength has created a cycle of declining returns, as Shiba Inu‚Äôs weekly gains have evaporated, although, on the monthly time frame, it‚Äôs still in the green, with a 7% increase. On the other hand, Shiba Inu‚Äôs burn rate has recorded an impressive 980% surge, with more than 30 million SHIB tokens removed from circulation. Shiba Inu loyalists are expecting this continued deflationary pressure to translate into¬†numbers. Pepe shows weakness, slips 10% Amid the market-wide surge, Pepe is struggling as it saw 10% of its valuation evaporate over the last day. At the time of writing, Pepe trades at $0.000018, a critical support level, that bulls must defend, otherwise further disruption could be in store, which could lead to a breakdown in price structure. Analyst Crypto Michael has recently shared a chart reading that shows the Pepe price being compressed by a descending trendline acting as a dynamic resistance. Once this trendline is flipped into support, Pepe could enter escape velocity and regain momentum. This is expected to happen in the upcoming weeks, as the long-anticipated Pepe Halving event is set to take place on February 4. This update will reduce Pepe‚Äôs emission rate, which will in turn increase scarcity, creating a disparity between demand and supply and priming Pepe for a massive run above $0.000030. Conclusion While both Shiba Inu and Pepe will likely set new all-time highs at the height of the bull run, Rollblock has the advantage of a significantly smaller market cap. This means that it can sustain an exponential rally, granting outsized returns. In the 9th presale stage, RBLK tokens sell for just $0.046, a perfect entry point for early adopters who want to capitalize on Rollblock‚Äôs GambleFi revolution. With an 800% increase expected by the end of the presale alone and a 100x multiplier in the cards post-launch, there has never been a better time to get involved.

That‚Äôs exactly what Rollblock is doing right now. This blockchain-powered GambleFi platform is rewriting the playbook for online gaming, and with its 2025 token presale closing in on the $10 million mark, it‚Äôs clear that people are taking notice. Even loyal Dogecoin and Solana holders who are usually laser-focused on their own ecosystems‚Äîare making room in their portfolios for this rising star. What‚Äôs Behind Rollblock‚Äôs Presale Success? Rollblock isn‚Äôt just another cheap entrant into the many competing crypto projects out there. It‚Äôs carving out a niche in the $450 billion online gambling industry by tackling one of its biggest pain points: trust. In this platform, it is possible to record absolutely every bet, every payout, and every single result, and this is done through the use of Blockchain. This is a more reliable crypto ecosystem that guarantees players of fairness of the games which has been a major concern in the previous days in online traditional casinos. The figures also support Rollblock‚Äôs meteoric rise. Jackpot Joy offers more than 7 thousand games and covers slots, poker, blackjack, and many others. Users bet $1,325,300 in December alone. But they estimate that it will heighten dramatically following the increase in the number of players and investors.. Why Dogecoin and Solana Investors Are Paying Attention It‚Äôs not every day you see communities as established as Dogecoin and Solana flocking to a new project. So what‚Äôs drawing them in? For starters, Rollblock isn‚Äôt just a gambling platform‚Äîit‚Äôs an investment opportunity. Apart from earning a cut from the casino, $RBLK which is Rollblock‚Äôs token also shares in its earnings. Fundamentally, what they are doing is not merely investing in games; they are investing in the success of the ecosystem. There is one more significant advantage ‚Äì the company that owns Rollblock is deflationary. To promote itself-sustainability, besides a part of the profits earned a week, the platform repurchases $RBLK tokens and 60% out of each is reduced. This makes the total potential number of tokens in the market lesser, which could in the long run shoot up its price. Of course, it would seem as an enjoyable idea for investors who are still searching for some longer-term gains. Other examples of such coins are Dogecoin and communities supporting beneficiaries of decentralized technologies like Solana. Rollblock‚Äôs approach aligns with their values by offering transparency and a decentralized revenue-sharing model. It‚Äôs no surprise those within the Dogecoin and Solana communities are embracing Rollblock as a fresh addition to their portfolios. A Fresh Take on Online Gambling Rollblock is addressing one of the biggest complaints players have about online gambling: fairness, which is particularly important for Dogecoin and Solana holders who are used to transparent, community-driven projects."" How often have you played a slot or roulette game and thought that the odds were a tad too small? That is eliminated by Rollblock as the result of every game is stored through the use of blockchain. You can check the data yourself, so there‚Äôs no room for funny business. However, the platform has other qualities that make it favorable, at Rollblock now there are more than 7000 games and new features are introduced quite frequently. And even if you‚Äôre a complete novice who just plays them to pass the time or a strategic bettor who loves to go all in, you‚Äôre in the right place. And if that wasn‚Äôt enough, Rollblock is also experimenting with AI-driven games and partnerships to keep players engaged. They‚Äôre not just coasting on a few flashy features; they‚Äôre building a full-on crypto ecosystem that‚Äôs designed to keep people coming back. The Road to $10 Million and Beyond With Rollblock‚Äôs 2025 presale currently hovering just under the $10 million marker, there appears to be no stopping in the immediate future. The project has also managed to achieve a membership base of more than 40 thousand and counting. Some investors are viewing this as being more than a ‚Äòquick buck‚Äô ‚Äì this is people getting a seat at the table from the ground-up of what could potentially consistently re-define the electronic gaming industry. What‚Äôs next for Rollblock? The team also stated that they have ambitions to expand their crypto ecosystem which implies active development of new games and functions that will ensure a continuous flow of the targeted audience. They are also interested in developing relations with other projects in the crypto sphere in order to attract more attention and users beyond investors in Dogecoin and Solana. How to Get Involved If Rollblock has piqued your interest, now‚Äôs the time to get involved.

Nevertheless, the asset faces a pivotal resistance at $3.5K, and the upcoming price action will likely define its next trend. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart ETH encountered significant buying interest near the 100-day moving average at the $3.2K mark, propelling the price upward by 10%. This heightened buying pressure has brought the asset closer to a critical resistance region at $3.5K, which aligns with the bullish flag‚Äôs upper boundary. If this momentum persists, Ethereum is likely to break above the $3.5K threshold, paving the way for a fresh surge toward the $4K resistance zone. However, the short-term price action will be critical in determining the market‚Äôs direction, with elevated volatility expected. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, ETH‚Äôs volatility is evident as the price fluctuates near the 0.5-0.618 Fibonacci retracement levels. This range, bounded by $3.2K as support and $3.5K as resistance, highlights the ongoing battle between buyers and sellers. The current market structure shows optimism, with the potential for a bullish breakout gaining momentum. If buyers succeed, Ethereum could embark on a sustained rally toward $4K. However, the increased volatility and potential liquidations necessitate careful risk management, as a rejection at $3.5K could lead to short-term retracements. Onchain Analysis By Shayan While Ethereum has been consolidating within a tight range of $3.2K-$3.5K, market participants are considering the likelihood of a bullish breakout following President Trump‚Äôs inauguration. The funding rates metric, a key indicator of market sentiment, has shown declining values recently, suggesting a reduction in long positions and fading bullish sentiment. However, the metric has sharply increased most recently, hinting at growing bullish momentum in the perpetual markets. As Ethereum approaches the $3.5K resistance level, the presence of notable supply at this juncture underscores the necessity of sustained bullish momentum. For a decisive breakout to occur, the funding rates metric must rise further, reflecting heightened market optimism and increased long positions. A break above $3.5K remains contingent on stronger bullish sentiment in the futures market. The funding rates metric will play a pivotal role in determining whether Ethereum can overcome the $3.5K threshold, making the upcoming market action crucial.

The ceremony is set to begin at 12:00 pm ET (10:30 pm IST) in Washington, DC, marking the beginning of his second term. The White House will stream the ceremony on its official website at https://www.whitehouse.gov . Major U.S. networks, including NBC, CNN, ABC, CBS News, Fox News, and C-SPAN, will also provide live coverage of the event. In his pre-inauguration rally, Trump addressed his supporters in Washington, reiterating his commitment to address America‚Äôs crises and ensure the nation‚Äôs future prosperity. Despite bad weather forcing the event indoors, his supporters remain enthusiastic, looking forward to his return to power after a turbulent few years. After the swearing-in, Trump will sign hundreds of executive orders and actions, with members of Congress observing the ceremony. Trump has promised swift action once he takes office, which he stressed in a rally the night before his inauguration. Trump‚Äôs supporters are already in Washington, gathering to watch the inauguration and cheer for their president. Bitcoin has experienced an unexpected surge, despite initial concerns that the launch of political meme coins, particularly the Trump coin, could divert funds away from Bitcoin. Rather than causing a negative impact, the release of the Trump coin seems to have ignited further excitement in the cryptocurrency market. Contrary to expectations, the broader cryptocurrency market, including Bitcoin, is seeing positive momentum, with Bitcoin recently hitting a new record high of $109K just few hours ago. The next few days could see continued growth in the crypto market, especially if executive orders focus on the industry.

Its presale has now hit the $50 million funding milestone, after adding another $5 million in just a week. This growth puts WEPE among the hottest crypto projects of 2025. Most meme coin presales lose traction after a few days of launch ‚Äì so how is Wall Street Pepe defying this trend? One reason for this is that meme coins thrive on community engagement, rather than market optimism alone. The excitement surrounding WEPE centers on the fact that it‚Äôs not just another Pepe-inspired token‚Äîit‚Äôs a multifaceted project that offers exclusive trading insights, to help smaller traders take on the whales who frequently manipulate the markets to their advantage. Investors can buy WEPE for just $0.00036649 , with the price set to quickly take off as the presale progresses. How WEPE Aims to Give Power Back to Retail Traders Wall Street Pepe is a meme coin for everyday retail traders who are tired of watching whales move the markets according to their own preferences. Even though whales have massive holdings and can quickly flip a token‚Äôs price, Wall Street Pepe believes the power of collective intelligence can offset these challenges‚Äîif enough regular investors share insights and join forces. This is why Wall Street Pepe has built an exclusive ‚ÄúWEPE Army‚Äù group, where market pros discuss real-time market calls and outline trade setups. Instead of being caught off-guard by manipulative ‚Äúpump and dump‚Äù schemes, these traders can see the warning signs early and position themselves for better trades. https://twitter.com/WEPEToken/status/1863905080426058015 Given that WEPE‚Äôs approach focuses on leveling the playing field for smaller traders, it‚Äôs resonating with individuals who‚Äôve felt overshadowed by whales during previous meme coin runs. Many popular crypto analysts and influencers are bullish on WEPE. For instance, the Crypto Gains channel recently told its 144K YouTube subscribers why Wall Street Pepe looks ready to achieve a massive upside following its exchange launches. The analyst predicted that if retail investors continue to push WEPE‚Äôs momentum, it could easily see a 10x surge when it starts collecting tier-1 exchange listings. This figure might even be conservative, if market conditions remain favorable and the project continues to attract supporters. Comparisons to Pepe‚Äôs Historic Rise PEPE‚Äôs massive price surge in 2023 made millionaires out of early buyers‚Äìand some investors wonder if WEPE might replicate or surpass that level of success. CoinMarketCap data shows that PEPE surged by over 174 million percent from its all-time low, turning a few hundred dollars into life-changing wealth. While such gains are tough to replicate, Wall Street Pepe‚Äôs presale performance shows that it could see massive demand once it launches on exchanges. Even a fraction of PEPE‚Äôs historical multiplier might see small early investments surge dramatically. Grinding. Stacking. Focused on the green. pic.twitter.com/W0MbgCIoaL ‚Äî Wall Street Pepe (@WEPEToken) January 14, 2025 The real key to these gains often lies in securing a listing on a tier-1 crypto exchange. Historically, tokens that manage to debut on platforms like Binance, Coinbase, or other high-volume exchanges see a significant uptick in price. Per the Wall Street Pepe team, a tier-1 listing is very much on the table‚Äîespecially given the $50 million raised so far. That sum signals to major exchanges that the project has strong community backing and liquidity potential. Last Chance to Buy WEPE Before Presale Ends Looking at its early momentum, Wall Street Pepe‚Äôs presale might sell out even faster than expected. The speed at which it raised $50 million in its presale speaks volumes about the desire for a new meme coin that does more than just ride existing trends. You can visit the official Wall Street Pepe website , link a Web3 wallet (such as Best Wallet ), and buy WEPE tokens using ETH, USDT, BNB, or a credit card. Your WEPE tokens can also still be staked to generate passive income at an APY of up to 25% pa.",Press Release,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|PEPE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-20 13:55:38

This surge underscores buyers‚Äô dominance in the market, with the potential for further upward momentum. XRP Analysis By Shayan The Weekly Chart During the weekly timeframe, XRP demonstrated substantial strength by breaking above a key resistance zone, including the multi-year wedge‚Äôs upper boundary and the prior major swing high of $2. This bullish breakout was fueled by the 100-day and 200-day moving averages at $0.6, highlighting strong buyer activity. The asset has now reached its ATH at $3.4, with the RSI indicator signaling an overbought state. While a temporary correction or consolidation may be anticipated, the ongoing buying pressure suggests the possibility of continuing the uptrend toward new ATHs. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, Ripple‚Äôs bullish structure is evident. After breaking above a short-term sideways wedge pattern at $2.5, the asset surged optimistically, nearing its ATH. However, the price encounters resistance near the $3.3-$3.4 region, a zone with significant supply. While a temporary rejection and market consolidation may occur, the strong bullish momentum suggests a potential breakout above this resistance, possibly setting new ATHs. Nevertheless, heightened volatility should be anticipated in the near term.

Every corner of crypto social media is hosting fierce debates between ‚Äúthis is going to end badly‚Äù and the investor optimism of ‚ÄúTrump is big for crypto.‚Äù We‚Äôre only getting started. Since Friday, January 17, we‚Äôve seen an Inaugural Crypto Ball event attended by industry leaders, and President-elect Trump and his wife Melania have launched their own memecoins, TRUMP and MELANIA. We can‚Äôt deny that in recent months, even beyond the last three days, some ‚Äúlucky‚Äù investors have made a fortune, just as Trump promised during his campaign period. But does the incoming POTUS have the industry‚Äôs best interest at heart? You should know better by now; it is and has always been about business. Memecoins are dangerous gambles; what about TRUMP and MELANIA? Several industry experts, including Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, have long called memecoins assets that are ‚Äúnotoriously over-reliant‚Äù on social media hype and volatile value swings with no utility whatsoever. And really, looking at the price trend of tokens like DOGE and PEPE, it‚Äôs hard to argue with that sentiment; their prices rose because the memes were trendy. The Official Trump token debuted on Friday, and within 24 hours, its market cap soared to $15 billion. Even Melania‚Äôs memecoin, released about 48 hours later, saw its market cap jump past $5 billion hours after launch. The pro-TRUMP community would give you tons and tons of explanations to warrant how all that happened. However, if they attribute it to anything other than hype, don‚Äôt believe them. According to tokenomics details shared by netizens on social media, both projects have more than 80% of their total tokens held in addresses believed to be owned by the development team. If it were any other token or any other personality, the red flags would be unignorable. The utility question does not have any watertight answers either. Enthusiasm at the expense of financial gain Since Trump‚Äôs electoral victory in November, the number of new memecoins has surged, as crypto enthusiasts are banking on a more favorable regulatory environment under his administration. However, the timing of these Trump-affiliated token launches, just hours before his inauguration ceremony, overtly screams predatory behavior. No surprise the New York Times only used the negative part of my post on Trumpcoin Trumpcoin is great. It signals the end of the Biden era of establishment control and the start of crypto innovation flourishing in the U.S. Just hope they put 80% of the supply to good use. pic.twitter.com/ExZnfVEeLR ‚Äî Nick Tomaino (@NTmoney) January 19, 2025 It could also be that the Trump family knows how the crypto market reacts to ‚Äúcertain conditions,‚Äù in regard to memecoins. The man is set to assume responsibilities as the 47th President of the US on Monday. He obviously will be restricted from influencing markets in any kind of way. So what does he do? He launches these memecoins as fast as anyone can say pump-and-dump, and by the time he enters the Oval Office, money is already in his pockets. There‚Äôs a developing pattern with Donald Trump; if a crypto initiative doesn‚Äôt directly benefit him, even if it‚Äôs a federal Bitcoin reserve, then he won‚Äôt actually push for it. The Trump family‚Äôs growing crypto interests If there‚Äôs anything we‚Äôve learned from Hailey Welch‚Äôs HAWK and Justice for Peanut coin stories, it is that memecoins are all about fun and games. At least, until they are not. Jokes have made the rounds on social media about every member of the Trump family launching meme tokens. A time could come when it‚Äôs no longer funny. LIVE: Donald Trump just announced the next meme coins soon to be launched: $TRUMP $BARRON $MELANIA pic.twitter.com/m1nRCFlRk2 ‚Äî MAKE CRYPTO GREAT AGAIN (@cryptobergmann) January 20, 2025 Both Melania and Trump‚Äôs memecoins have been branded as ‚Äúdigital collectibles,‚Äù framed as expressions of their values rather than an investment opportunity. However, naysayers, including Anthony Scaramucci, Trump‚Äôs former communications director, have denounced the family‚Äôs foray into memecoins, calling it harmful to the crypto industry‚Äôs credibility. ‚ÄúLaunch of Melania coin is causing Trump coin to crash. Elon was right, we are living in a simulation. Which one of the kids coins will perform best? The day before inauguration as leader of free world and this is what Trump is focused on. Tells you everything you need to know,‚Äù said Scaramucci on X. For Trump, crypto could be about decentralized finance or technological innovation, but all that is just what the ‚Äúmainstream media‚Äù tells you; it‚Äôs all about the profits. Jonathan Bixby, a crypto entrepreneur, told Bloomberg that the launches could herald a ‚Äúbanana zone‚Äù in which celebrity-backed tokens flood the market, and that could cause people to lose a lot of money. Trump needs to fire his crypto advisors, from top to bottom and replace with people who know what they are doing. The memecoins cost the US, the presidency and his family a lot of credibility and the consequences haven‚Äôt even started. ‚Äî Gabor Gurbacs (@gaborgurbacs) January 20, 2025 The sentiments were also echoed by Gabor Gurbacs, VanEck‚Äôs former digital-asset strategy director, who shared his thoughts on X, saying that the consequences of these launches ‚Äúhave not even started.‚Äù Crypto stakeholders should watch out Launching tokens without a business model or intrinsic value only means one thing: Trump and his family have reinforced stereotypes about them making everything business. This time, it is at the expense of the crypto industry. All of us will finally regret that Donald Trump got involved with crypto Lmao ü§£ A day to inauguration, he has used his own memecoin $trump to wreck other crypto aside from $sol and $btc This is so dangerous, no man is suppose to be that powerful in crypto Crazy ‚Äî dream chaser jtk (@dreamchaserjtk) January 19, 2025 Crypto could be merely another avenue to expand the incoming US President‚Äôs business empire. The general sentiment is that any initiative that doesn‚Äôt serve his personal or financial interests is unlikely to go far during his presidency. The president-elect does not draw from the same source of fanatics within the crypto community; the crypto industry would do better to recognize this and focus on projects that prioritize long-term value and credibility over short-term hype. In the end, if the crypto sector wants to be taken seriously, it must strike a balance between the spectacle of price surges from politically and fame-ridden memecoins, and cryptos that offer real utility. Otherwise, we will continue seeing court cases about huge losses from proclaimed ‚Äúpump-and-dump‚Äù schemes; a little DYOR goes a long way, people.",OP-ED|Hawk|Melania|TRUMP|WLF,EN,0,0,MARKET|BUSINESS|ETH|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-20 13:57:50

Notably, recent reports from across the globe reveal that the advisory panel is being sued right after Donald Trump takes office on Monday. As a result, the crypto realm remains cautious as speculations of Dogecoin price taking a blow also persist, given Musk‚Äôs massive influence on the token. DOGE Lawsuit Right After Trump‚Äôs Inauguration Sparks Concerns According to a recent report from The Washington Post , Elon Musk‚Äôs DOGE is to be sued right after Donald Trump‚Äôs presidential inauguration on January 20. A U.S. watchdog group (National Security Counselors) appears to have alleged that the advisory panel has violated federal transparency laws. Intriguingly, the lawsuit particularly alleges that the Musk-led panel meets the requirements to be called a ‚Äúfederal advisory committee.‚Äù It appears to have failed to meet the requirements of a 1972 law that established rules on disclosure, hiring, and other practices. As a result, the Department of Government Efficiency is sued within minutes of the Republican taking office. However, IBC Group co-founder Mario Nawfal has recently posted on X , claiming that ‚Äúthis is just lawfare to stop Trump‚Äôs plan to slash waste and shrink bloated bureaucracy.‚Äù Altogether, in light of the lawsuit, Dogecoin (DOGE) has captured significant attention across the globe, particularly among crypto enthusiasts across the broader market. Dogecoin Price To Take Hit? At the time of reporting, Dogecoin price witnessed a highly turbulent action, slipping by 1% to reach $0.3716. The coin‚Äôs 24-hour low and high were $0.3472 and $0.3984, respectively. Crypto market traders and investors remain extremely cautious as the DOGE lawsuit unfolds as such previous chronicles have negatively impacted prices. It can be seen in the case of Ripple vs. SEC , as the token showcased a prolonged sluggish performance before finally rallying to cross $3 again in 2025. It‚Äôs noteworthy that the rally came against the backdrop of Gary Gensler‚Äôs exit from the SEC and a pro-crypto wave under Trump‚Äôs presidency.

Dogecoin: From Meme to Mainstream ‚Äì Is DOGE the Next Big Crypto Bet? Dogecoin started as a joke in 2013, featuring the Shiba Inu meme as its logo.

Initially a ‚Äúmemecoin,‚Äù it surged in 2021. Social media buzz and Elon Musk‚Äôs endorsements propelled it into the top ten cryptocurrencies, with a market cap over $50 billion. This rise showed the power of community and social media in finance. Despite its humorous beginnings, Dogecoin has potential. It offers fast transactions with low fees, making it user-friendly. In today‚Äôs market, as investors look beyond traditional coins, DOGE stands out for its community and accessibility. While it lacks Bitcoin‚Äôs scarcity or Ethereum‚Äôs smart contracts, its popularity makes it appealing. As the crypto market evolves, Dogecoin could be attractive for diversification. Its mix of fun and utility might keep it in the spotlight. Conclusion While established tokens like DOGE have merit, XYZ offers a unique sports memecoin experience with significant growth potential and a community-driven ecosystem.

QCP Capital: TRUMP Could Boost SOL‚Äôs Prospects by Kicking Off Memecoin Altcoin Season The firm suggests that TRUMP‚Äôs entry onto the Solana (SOL) blockchain represents a significant validation for the network and could accelerate regulatory approval for a Solana-based ETF. QCP Capital highlighted the importance of selecting Solana for the TRUMP token launch, stating that the move is a strong vote of confidence in the blockchain. Solana has been gaining momentum in recent months due to its high transaction speeds, low costs, and growing ecosystem. ‚ÄúThe launch of the TRUMP memecoin on Solana proves a significant validation of the chain,‚Äù QCP said in its market analysis. Potential ETF Approval Boost QCP claimed that the high-profile nature of TRUMP‚Äôs Solana launch could accelerate approval for a Solana-based exchange-traded fund (ETF). The firm noted that such a move would be in line with growing institutional interest in Solana, particularly as it continues to position itself as a major player in the blockchain space. ‚ÄúGiven the attention Solana has received from the TRUMP launch, it is conceivable that a SOL ETF could gain approval much earlier than expected,‚Äù the report said. The launch of the TRUMP token has already attracted significant media attention, and QCP believes that this interest will further fuel market activity by increasing retail penetration into altcoins. The firm highlighted that the memecoin phenomenon tends to attract retail investors and creates a ripple effect that could benefit a wide range of alternative cryptocurrencies. ‚ÄúAs similar launches receive increased media coverage, retail inflows are likely to flood in, setting the stage for a broader altcoin rally,‚Äù QCP concluded. If QCP's predictions come true, the launch of TRUMP could be the beginning of a significant shift in market dynamics, with altcoins coming to the fore. *This is not investment advice.

He often endorses cryptocurrencies and is in close ties with President-elect Donald Trump, who has recently launched the TRUMP meme coin. With that, the investors await a similar move from a multi-billionaire, but will that happen? Let‚Äôs discuss. Elon Musk‚Äôs Meme Coin Obsession & Endorsement Tesla‚Äôs owner is known for his open support for the most popular meme coin, Dogecoin. Along with the crypto community, he calls himself the Dogefather and has often influenced the price of this token. This involved Trump changing the X (previously known as Twitter) logo to Shiba Inu, the dog behind Dogecoin‚Äôs face‚Äîmoreover, Tesla accepts DOGE for merchandise shopping. ‚ÄúI intend to personally support Dogecoin‚Äù ‚Äî Elon Musk pic.twitter.com/ZAaS9jIw5S ‚Äî CEO (@Investments_CEO) January 18, 2025 Musk believes that this meme-themed cryptocurrency has the potential to transform digital transactions. However, this meme currency frenzy does not just end there, as over the years, Elon has endorsed a few other cryptocurrencies. The latest example is with Kekius Maximus a few months back. Musk changed his profile name and image to the game-based cryptocurrency. This led to KEKIUS prices skyrocketing 4800%. Right after this, Musk endorsed CumRocket memecoin , whose outcome was similar to the first. Interestingly, Musk‚Äôs posts about cryptos immediately boost their prices. Experts believe that if Elon Musk launches a token, it will become even more popular than the TRUMP and MELANIA memecoins . Will Elon Musk Launch A Meme Coin Next? Till reporting, there has been no news of Musk launching a meme coin. However, he has often shown interest in these cryptocurrencies, with which some experts believe in the possible launch, especially as Donald Trump has launched his official meme-themed cryptocurrency. Additionally, Musk has been working on turning X into one in all platforms like WeChat, where users can connect and even make transactions. For this, he has secured a money-transmitting license in 25 US states. Considering Musk‚Äôs love for crypto, experts anticipate a possible crypto launch or adoption of Dogecoin. How Will Elon Musk‚Äôs Crypto Launch Affect the Market? The biggest hurdles to the crypto market‚Äôs growth are the lack of regulations and government disapproval of its decentralized nature. Proper rules and industry support could resolve these issues for both nations and investors. Donald Trump‚Äôs inauguration and presidency are already supportive factors, but Tesla owner‚Äôs involvement could push it to another level. Thanks to Musk‚Äôs popularity, integrating cryptocurrency with X will increase adoption, establish credibility, and build trust among new users. Additionally, it will change X‚Äôs outlook from a simple social media platform into an economic ecosystem. If this happens, people can connect, shop, trade, and engage in other activities, making it a diversified and effective platform. Bottom Line After Donald Trump and celebrities like Hawk Tuah Girl launched their meme-themed cryptocurrencies, Elon Musk is next in line. However, there is no news of this happening, but the anticipation is building, considering his love for these digital assets. At the same time, analysts believe Donald Trump‚Äôs influence could result in Musk launching his meme coin to implement transaction services on X. Musk‚Äôs crypto launch could benefit X by turning it into a multi-functional platform. More importantly, it could influence crypto adoption and early regulation.

According to data from Spot On Chain, the Ethereum Foundation made its first Ethereum ( ETH ) sale in the new year on Jan. 8, 2025, dumping 100 ETH and gaining 329,463 DAI ( DAI ) tokens in return. On-chain data reveals that throughout 2024, EF has sold a total of 4,466 ETH for $12.61 million at an average value of $2,823. These sales are claimed to often occur right before sharp price drops. Traders on X were quick to put EF on blast for continuously dumping ETH instead of staking from their own protocol. ‚ÄúIn order to be totally neutral, we literally cannot use the chain we are here to uphold and protect. I‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù wrote an account with the username DCinvestor in a sarcastic tone, mimicking the EF. ‚Äù ‚ÄòThe EF uses the chain, actually our number 1 use case is dumping ETH.‚Äô Actually insane,‚Äù commented another Ethereum trader with the username eric.eth, adding that EF should stake ETF and use DeFi to cover internal costs. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin came to EF‚Äôs defense by responding to the criticism, stating the two key reasons why the foundation chooses not to stake ETH. The concerns historically were (1) regulatory, (2) if EF stakes ourselves, this de-facto forces us to take a position on any future contentious hard fork. (1) is less than before, (2) remains. There's definitely ways to minimize (2), and we're recently been exploring them. ‚Äî vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 20, 2025 You might also like: Ethereum Foundation offloads 100 ETH for 334k DAI in latest purchase Buterin cited regulatory concerns as being the first reason. Considering Ethereum is one of the largest crypto protocols by market cap, staking a significant amount of ETH could attract unwanted regulatory scrutiny. Such actions could potentially raise questions about whether Ethereum counts as a security or not. Something many crypto firms have had trouble with over the years. The second reason mentioned by Buterin relates to how staking ETH would require the Ethereum Foundation to ‚Äútake a position on any future contentious hard fork.‚Äù In this case, Buterin is referring to potential divide within the ecosystem which could lead to one side of the community preferring one blockchain version over the other. Therefore, if EF were to stake its own tokens using one blockchain instead of the other, it would appear as if the EF were endorsing that chain and making its position known. Vitalik Buterin acknowledges that regulatory concerns have lessened over the years, though the second reason still remains. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs definitely ways to minimize, and we‚Äôre recently been exploring them,‚Äù he wrote. In addition, he also explained how withdrawal of ETH could wound up taking longer compared to simply selling the tokens. This is often due to the high number of validators that also use the chain. Therefore, if the EF is the only entity to withdraw ETH, then it would take 2.6 days to complete. However, if many stakers were to withdraw simultaneously alongside EF, then it could take up to 58 days to complete. That is, if 20% of Ethereum stakers withdraw at the same time.

With 88% of supply in one wallet, MELANIA‚Äôs centralization raises manipulation risks amid high volatility. MELANIA on the Run Donald Trump, the upcoming president of the USA, whose inauguration is later today (January 20), and his wife, Melania Trump, have made serious waves in the crypto sector lately. Both of them launched meme coins, and as it turned out, they turned into sensations. Melania Meme (MELANIA) saw the light of day several hours ago, and its market cap exploded to almost $2 billion mere hours later. Its price surpassed $13 before falling below $7.50. Ever since that dip, though, the valuation started heading north again. It crossed $13 again, while its market cap crossed the $2 billion mark, placing MELANIA among the top 100 biggest cryptocurrencies. Currently, the asset is placed on the 74th spot (per CoinMarketCap‚Äôs data) after another correction that pushed it down to $8. MELANIA‚Äôs previous rally was likely fueled by Binance and Bybit, which allowed trading services with the meme coin. The former introduced MELANIA/USDT perpetual contracts with up to 25x leverage. Bybit launched the same offering but with up to 50x leverage. These products allow traders to speculate on token prices without owning them and can be held indefinitely. They offer high reward potential but come with significant risks due to leverage and liquidation exposure. Support from two of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges usually has a positive effect on the prices of the involved assets due to increased liquidity, improved accessibility, and boosted credibility. Beware the Risks MELANIA‚Äôs pump might be pretty impressive, but investors should keep in mind the volatile nature of such tokens, hence the risks of devastating losses. In addition, 88% of the meme coin‚Äôs total supply is held by a single wallet, which indicates a high concentration of ownership. Reduced decentralization makes such projects vulnerable to manipulation since the large holders can easily influence the market performance by dumping their holdings (for example). People are warned to jump on the bandwagon only after conducting proper research and invest only as much as they are ready to part with.

Here‚Äôs another way for you! Bitget, in a striking move towards driving smarter crypto investment solutions, has launched its highly rewarding and innovative Hold-to-Earn service ‚Äì Bitget HolderYield. This Hold-to-Earn service is currently launched only for two interest-bearing tokens, weETH (Wrapped eTH, a liquid staking token) and USDE (stablecoin). Bitget aims to continuously add more tokens soon apart from the mentioned two. How much will the Bitget users earn from HolderYield tokens? In a rewarding way to distribute passive income to its users, Bitget offers baseline Annual Percentage Returns (APR) and other ways of earning by participating in promotions. Just by holding weETH and USDE , regardless of the account in which the crypto holdings are stored, an APR of around 20% can be expected for users. On partnership with Bitget by offering its token ‚Äì weETH as collateral ‚Äì Ether.fi founder and CEO, Mike Silagadze commented, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had a ton of customer demand for weETH as collateral and are excited to partner with Bitget to make that a reality! Bitget users who hold weETH will passively earn on their ETH while maintaining price exposure.‚Äù Calling the move as more ‚Äúuser-friendly‚Äù, Bitget CEO Gracy Chen also expressed enthusiasm, commenting, ‚ÄúThis has simplified the steps required for users to start earning yields on our platform, making it even more user-friendly as users no longer need to worry about liquidity and lock-up periods‚Äù. What are the ways to invest in HolderYield tokens? After having Bitget main account with complete identity verification, users can buy these interest-bearing tokens in three ways: Spot Holdings ‚Äì where users can purchase and hold tokens directly, enjoying baseline APR. Future Holdings ‚Äì in this, users can use these tokens as margins for futures trading in multi-asset mode, making the margin amount also eligible to make earnings. Sub-account Holdings: for assets held in regular sub-accounts and virtual sub-accounts. Daily Settled Earnings Though you can sell your holdings at any time, to maximize earnings, during promotions, maintaining sufficient holdings are suggested. There are also minimum holding requirements as users must hold at least 1 USDT worth of weETH in their respective account. After investing, earnings are settled daily in respective tokens only. Distributions will be calculated based on the closing price of ETHFI at 8:00 AM (UTC+8) the following day. Users will receive the distributed earnings next day in their respective accounts at 06:00 AM (UTC+8). Bitget‚Äôs initiative user-friendly but demands caution Users have to be cautious about investing as APR at HolderYield token holdings is supposed to fluctuate, owing to market price volatility. Moreover, users also need to keep in mind the profit-generating mechanism of the respective tokens protocol, for example, for WEEETH, it is Blockchain staking yield. Change in its network conditions and staking returns can lead to adjusted yields. Nonetheless, if the tokens experience a rise in price at the time of sale after their holding period, users are poised for good returns ‚Äì making HodlerYield a good non-chaotic investment solution.

Dogecoin (DOGE) can be seen leaving behind Shiba Inu (SHIB) in a heartening revival of meme coins. At the same time, XRP continues its attempt at defeating a critical resistance near its all-time high of 2018. This renewed momentum also led to meme to utility project Yeti Ouro (YETIO) narrowing the gap in presale stages with an astonishing 40% growth. With Trump entering office, the crypto market is already seeing a positive impact. Dogecoin: DOGE Surmounts SHIB In The Revitalisation of Memes Coins In the past 24 hours, DOGE price progressed by 8.5% while jumping to a five-week high which stood at $0.419 . Based on recent data, some analysts attributed the inauguration of a pro-crypto U.S. administration and Elon Musk‚Äôs newly established D.O.G.E. to his bullish sentiment around DOGE. Although muted, some bullish forecasts have begun speculating sentiments on testing $1 by the end of 2025. If DOGE continues to clear the Fibonacci levels and reaches $0.391, there are potential indicators that point to a further rally however it would take somewhere around 20 ‚Äì 40 cents for DOGE to reclaim the $1 level. XRP Price Prediction: XRP Reaches Towards $3.40 Target Mark XRP is also attempting to get as close to the 2018 all-time high of $3.40, while DOGE and SHIB continue to grow the viral meme coin market. XRP has a trading price of approximately $3.23 at this time which is 40% higher than last week‚Äôs price. Some analysts think it got so high because of the rumors surrounding XRP-focused ETF policies. An increase in high-value transactions and whale addresses could also cause XRP price to cross $3.40. Additionally, sources from Ripple claim that there will be higher clarity from the SEC combined with a clearer listing they hope to add could also help with their target. YETIO: 40% Presale Growth Signals Market Appetite Compared to the main coins, Yeti Ouro remains largely unknown, but this did not stop it from growing by 40% in presale rounds. YETIO‚Äôs growth is attributed to its focus on the real world and meme culture. Yeti Ouro is established around a racing game powered by Unreal Engine, which is Play-to-Earn (P2E). By providing utility for his tokens, Yeti Ouro aims to deliver more in-game for mere speculation. Additionally, when combined with a deflationary burn mechanism and a restricted supply of one billion tokens, YETIO offers a stronger tokenomical model than the traditional meme coins that depend purely on market hype. The team shared a video showcasing the first glance at the Level 1 map at a distance. This is a larger area of the map that uses the same death match style game play. Players have a large surface area to avoid attackers and collect power-ups to help them defeat opponents. There is so much detail yet to be shown, with garages for vehicle repairs and upgrades as well as hidden tunnels and harsh terrains to get through. Conclusion The cryptocurrency market continues to demonstrate enthusiasm for established and new projects, as demonstrated by Dogecoin outperforming Shiba Inu and XRP pushing to an all-time high.
