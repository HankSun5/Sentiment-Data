Trump the Solana King (TRUMPKIN), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPKIN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Trump the Solana King can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump the Solana King could become the next viral memecoin. Trump the Solana King launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump the Solana King on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump the Solana King by entering its contract address ‚Äì 6oubDpkm3XF2x3r5vPZAhw2TABZgNrjmgwEqxUxLAYa ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPKIN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SOL|SHIB|BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-19 21:27:28

However, its success will depend on continued adoption, broader market adoption trends, and other cryptocurrency market space developments.

The network‚Äôs robust growth and expanding ecosystem make it a noteworthy player in the blockchain space. DeFi Llama ‚Äôs recent report shows that the L2 network has made significant achievements across multiple sectors. Base, A Rising Star in DeFi Space The DeFi space is growing fast, and Base has become the largest layer-2 network in the crypto world. It now hosts over 410 decentralized apps (dApps), revolutionizing how people use financial systems without relying on traditional banks. Key players in this thriving ecosystem include Aerodrome, Uniswap, Morpho Blue, and Moonwell. One of the standout protocols in the Base DeFi space is Morpho, a competitor to AAVE, which shows promise in decentralized lending and borrowing. Base‚Äôs activity is impressive, handling over $264 billion in transactions since its inception. More recently, transaction volume reached $12.2 billion in just one week, showcasing the high demand and utility of the network‚Äôs offerings. Speculatively, introducing Bitcoin-backed loans on Coinbase could further boost Base‚Äôs growth, pushing Morpho and other DeFi projects to new heights. Memecoins and NFTs Fuel Base‚Äôs Continued Success Base‚Äôs growth is not just about DeFi; its booming memecoin ecosystem also drives it . The memecoins are now worth over $2.6 billion, with tokens like Brett and Akuma Inu leading. NFTs are another highlight, with sales up 45% last week to $8.3 million and over 15,000 unique buyers. Cumulative NFT sales have exceeded $62 million, and the network handles over 40 million monthly transactions. These numbers place Base ahead of rivals like Arbitrum and Polygon. Base Expands Into AI and Gaming Sector In addition to its success in DeFi and NFTs, Base is expanding into emerging sectors such as artificial intelligence (AI) and gaming. This expansion is expected to open up new opportunities for developers and users, making Base an even more attractive platform for growth and innovation. Due to Base‚Äôs impressive expansion and strong user engagement, the network will likely achieve a substantial valuation. This is especially true if Coinbase rolls out the much-anticipated airdrop as part of its roadmap for 2025. The L2 scaling solution is set to become a major player in the layer-2 crypto space with an estimated fully diluted valuation (FDV) of $7 billion. This would place it ahead of competitors like Arbitrum, valued at $3.2 billion, and Optimism, at $2.47 billion. Such a valuation highlights its rapid growth and increasing importance in the DeFi ecosystem. If the trend continues, Base could solidify its position as a leader among layer-2 networks.

The altcoin, which rose above $70 during the day, fell to $40 with the latest decline. So what was the reason for this decline? As is known, TRUMP was officially launched yesterday morning by Donald Trump. The altcoin, which enabled Trump's wealth to increase fivefold at its peak, lost significant value minutes ago after Donald Trump's wife Melania Trump launched a memecoin called MELANIA.

At first, it was thought that Melania Trump's X and Truth Social accounts were hacked, but the tweets in question were also retweeted by Donald Trump's official X account.

This reform has been in progress for nearly a year and aims to align the foundation‚Äôs goals with the evolving needs of the Ethereum ecosystem. Vitalik Buterin shared on X that the changes are intended to fill gaps in technical expertise and improve the foundation‚Äôs collaboration with key ecosystem players, including developers, wallet providers, Layer-2 networks, and users. The updates also focus on enhancing decentralization, privacy, and open-source principles while advancing Ethereum‚Äôs role as a robust, censorship-resistant platform for decentralized applications. The foundation is also planning to integrate more decentralized technologies into its internal processes, such as payments and treasury management. Over the past year, the Ethereum Foundation has faced criticism for being too passive and concerns about its spending and operational priorities. These reforms aim to rebuild trust and strengthen relationships within the ecosystem. Buterin emphasized that the foundation will remain neutral and avoid political lobbying or catering to specific interests, preserving Ethereum‚Äôs position as a global platform. He reaffirmed EF‚Äôs dedication to empowering developers and fostering innovation rather than engaging in political influence. ‚ÄúThe Ethereum Foundation will not aggressively lobby regulators or political figures, especially in powerful countries like the USA. We must maintain Ethereum as a neutral global platform,‚Äù Buterin stated. In addition to Buterin‚Äôs remarks, co-founder Joseph Lubin proposed a dual-leadership model for guiding the foundation into its next phase. Lubin suggested that Ethereum developer Danny Ryan and Ethereum France President J√©r√¥me de Tychey take on leadership roles to balance technical and business strategies. Lubin highlighted their ability to navigate the challenges of the fast-changing blockchain industry while upholding Ethereum‚Äôs core principles. Lubin also stressed the importance of maintaining neutrality, likening Ethereum to Switzerland . Switzerland is a neutral nation that actively promotes its values and fosters international relationships . Lubin argued Ethereum could adopt a similar approach, championing its technological advancements while remaining impartial. He encouraged the community to advocate for Ethereum‚Äôs role in building a better future. Lubin concluded by emphasizing the need for energy, creativity, and determination in Ethereum‚Äôs leadership to ensure it continues to be the most trusted and versatile blockchain ecosystem. The proposed changes reflect a commitment to innovation, decentralization, and collaboration to better serve the Ethereum community and ecosystem.",,EN,0,0,ETH|BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-01-19 22:08:49

The China-owned platform announced that it was already restoring its services. The announcement was made amid reports that US users could access the platform service through its website but not the app. TikTok said : In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service. TikTok The popular social media platform thanked Trump for providing their service providers with clarity and assurance. They were grateful that they would face no penalties for providing the platform to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive. Trump proposes 50% stake of TikTok for America TikTok disappeared for its 170 million users in America on Saturday, a day before the shutdown order became effective. The company was shut down through a federal ban after the US cited National security interest. The US government officials warned that the platform exposes its data, so America‚Äôs data was at risk of being misused. However, the President-elect offered to extend the time frame before the ban takes effect so that America can cut a deal to protect its national security. Trump said that he desires the US to have a 50% ownership position on a joint venture of the fastest-growing social app. Trump said he would protect any company that helped TikTok from going dark through an executive order . Trump had earlier promised to give the platform a 90-day reprieve from the ban after he takes office, a promise the platform cited in a notice posted to users on the app. Trump‚Äôs approach to ensuring the continuity of TikTok in America is exciting and totally different from his first term in office when he issued an order to stop TikTok from operating in the US. The courts later revised the order. Trump also tried to have a deal to protect any data from TikTok reaching authorities in China. The East Asian country has a law that compels companies to submit data when the government demands it. The TikTok ban in the US stains China-US relations Although the TikTok ban was shortlived, it may have caused serious diplomatic wrangles between China and the US. Millions of Americans relied on the app for various initiatives, and the ban disrupted their routine. The app was already a symbol of culture to most users. Earlier, the platform released a brief statement from affected users, explaining that the Federal Reserve had passed a law banning its services in the US. The statement clarified that this was the reason America‚Äôs population could no longer access the platform. However, the users expressed optimism that the president-elect would collaborate with them to resolve the issue and reinstate TikTok. The statement also urged users to stay tuned for updates as had been removed from the Apple and Google app stores. Polymarket priced in a 95% chance of a TikTok ban going into effect TikTok ban and its developments found their way to Polymarket . The case of social media platforms was well represented on Polymarket. Would the app return? People were betting on it, and people were interested in the issue. The popular blockchain-based site Polymarket priced in a 95% chance of a TikTok ban going into effect in the U.S. by May, while its rival site Kalshi priced in 98% odds of a ban by May. The prediction platforms offer users the opportunity to wager on the outcomes of real-life events, purchasing contracts on either side of the outcome with odds moving accordingly based on the public money, similar to how a company‚Äôs share price changes as demand for buying and selling its stock moves. Many lost their bets when TikTok‚Äôs fate unexpectedly turned when they announced they would restore services. This outcome was a moment of relief and celebration for TikTok users, signaling the platform‚Äôs resilience amid challenges. It was a stark reminder for the betting platforms that even well-calculated odds can‚Äôt always account for the shifting tides of politics and diplomacy.

Its ICO was the talk of the crypto town, promising innovation, scalability, and a new way forward for blockchain technology. Those who got in early reaped the rewards as Cardano became one of the most prominent players in the crypto market. For the rest of us, though? It‚Äôs been a constant reminder of a golden opportunity missed. But here‚Äôs the thing about crypto: it‚Äôs full of second chances. Enter Qubetics, a project that‚Äôs redefining global finance with its innovative cross-border transaction solutions. With a presale that‚Äôs already making waves and the potential for explosive growth, Qubetics is positioning itself as one of the top cryptos to invest in January 2025 . If you missed out on Cardano, this is your chance to rewrite your crypto story. Cardano: The One That Set the Standard Cardano wasn‚Äôt just another blockchain project‚Äîit was a revolution. Launched in 2017, its focus on scalability, sustainability, and interoperability made it a standout in a crowded market. The project‚Äôs commitment to rigorous research and peer-reviewed development gave it an edge that few could match. During its ICO, Cardano‚Äôs ADA token was priced at just $0.02. Fast forward to today, and it‚Äôs become a staple in the portfolios of seasoned investors. Cardano‚Äôs rise wasn‚Äôt just about hype‚Äîit was a testament to the power of innovation and long-term vision. But for those of us who didn‚Äôt get in early, it‚Äôs been a tough pill to swallow. Watching Cardano‚Äôs success from the sidelines has been a constant reminder of what could have been. That‚Äôs why Qubetics feels like such a big deal‚Äîit‚Äôs the chance to get in early on something just as transformative.

Qubetics‚Äô presale has already raised over $9.9 million, with more than 425 million $TICS tokens sold . Analysts are predicting a post-launch price of $10-$15, which means early investors are staring at jaw-dropping ROI potential. This isn‚Äôt just a project with potential‚Äîit‚Äôs a project with momentum. And in the fast-paced world of crypto, that‚Äôs everything. Why Missing Qubetics Would Be Worse Than Missing Cardano We‚Äôve all felt the sting of a missed opportunity, but what if you could avoid it this time? Imagine scrolling through your news feed six months from now and seeing Qubetics dominating the headlines. The $TICS token is soaring, and early investors are cashing in on massive returns. Sound familiar? That‚Äôs exactly how Cardano played out for those who got in late‚Äîor not at all. But this time, you don‚Äôt have to be on the sidelines. Qubetics is still in its presale phase, which means the door is wide open. Don‚Äôt let this be another ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù moment. What Sets Qubetics Apart from the Crowd? While many blockchain projects focus on the here and now, Qubetics is building for the long term. Its cross-border transaction solution isn‚Äôt just innovative‚Äîit‚Äôs essential in a world that‚Äôs becoming increasingly interconnected. Qubetics isn‚Äôt just about hype‚Äîit‚Äôs about solving real problems. By making international payments faster, cheaper, and more transparent, it‚Äôs creating value for individuals, businesses, and financial institutions alike. What Happens If You Miss Qubetics? Let‚Äôs be real: missing Cardano hurt, but missing Qubetics could hurt even more. This isn‚Äôt just about financial returns‚Äîit‚Äôs about being part of a project that‚Äôs changing the game. The crypto world moves fast, and opportunities like this don‚Äôt come around often. If you‚Äôre looking for the top cryptos to invest in January 2025 , Qubetics isn‚Äôt just a good choice‚Äîit‚Äôs the choice. Conclusion: Your Second Chance Is Here Cardano taught us that timing is everything in crypto. Early investors saw life-changing returns, and the project became a benchmark for success. But if you missed the Cardano train, it‚Äôs time to stop looking back and start looking forward. Qubetics is here, and it‚Äôs offering a chance to be part of something truly transformative.

Related Reading: Bitcoin Reserve In The US: 65% Chance It Happens In 2025 Coinbase Reports Rise Of Altcoins Coinbase crypto exchange suggested that the upcoming massive market rally for altcoins could be on the way and might happen in the succeeding weeks after Trump returns to the White House. The crypto exchange released its latest weekly market commentary which provided its insights on Trump‚Äôs upcoming inauguration and its impact on the cryptocurrency landscape, saying that although the incoming American president is pro-crypto, it might take a while before ‚Äúall planned crypto-related policies on the agenda‚Äù will be fully implemented. However, Coinbase analysts noted that after Trump‚Äôs inauguration on January 20, they are expecting a surge in altcoins since, they believe, the digital asset space is preparing for a massive altcoin rally. The crypto exchange‚Äôs report stated that crypto traders might be strategically positioning themselves to fuel another growth spurt for altcoins under the Trump administration. According to Coinbase, the latest surge in altcoins is driven by a slight drop in the dominance of Bitcoin. ‚ÄúThe drop in BTC dominance from 58.5% to its support level of 57.3% during the inflation print relief rally on January 15 suggests to us that traders may be positioning for an outsized altcoin market rally on the back of positive catalysts for risk assets and crypto,‚Äù Coinbase explained in the report. BTC‚Äôs Fading Dominance A crypto analyst observed that the dominance of the world‚Äôs most popular cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, could be slightly dipping, a circumstance that allowed the latest altcoin pump. ‚ÄúImportantly for the long tail, $BTC dominance has been slowly fading since late November ‚Äô24 ‚Äì fireworks if that continues,‚Äù VC firm Placeholder partner and former ARK Invest crypto lead Chris Burniske said.

TRX, the network‚Äôs native currency, as well as WTRX, its wrapped version, experienced significant adoption due to decentralized finance (DeFi) activity. This was particularly seen on the Tron-based decentralized exchange (DEX), SunSwap, which sparked an influx of new tokens and increased transaction activity, which, in turn, aided in Tron‚Äôs diversification beyond stablecoin transactions. Tron‚Äôs Shift Beyond Stablecoin Transactions According to CryptoQuant‚Äôs latest analysis , the Tron network‚Äôs activity remains heavily influenced by USDT, which saw its supply increase from $48 billion to $62 billion in 2024. Over the same period, the value of USDT transfers surged from $362 billion to $576 billion. This was accompanied by a rise in monthly transfers from 55 million to 62 million. USDT continues to dominate as the most transferred asset and makes up 99% of token activity. Tron, however, reached a turning point in DeFi activity last year, with SunSwap leading the charge as the network‚Äôs most active decentralized exchange. By August, monthly transactions on SunSwap had climbed to 4 million, with 97% involving WTRX. From August through December, total swap transactions climbed to 8.3 million, reflecting a growth in DeFi engagement. Over 80% of these transactions involved WTRX, which saw its swap volume skyrocket from 4.2 billion to 20 billion units, or $4.1 billion, by year-end. The launch of meme coin generator SunPump further fueled network activity by simplifying meme coin creation, resulting in the introduction of 94,000 new tokens and a surge in transaction volumes. In another milestone, Tron also overtook Bitcoin as the most-used payment blockchain, ultimately securing 31.5% of all transactions. But, the developments failed to lift the price of TRX. TRX‚Äôs Short-Lived Recovery? TRX did see a resurgence last year, climbing back to the 10th spot in market capitalization as it instilled fresh confidence. The subsequent market corrections, however, pushed the asset‚Äôs price to $0.225, representing a nearly 50% decline from its recent all-time high of $0.43. Hopes for a local bottom also proved short-lived when TRX dropped below the $0.23 threshold.

Analyzing the recent price action, MEME‚Äôs price has fluctuated significantly over the past month, with notable resistance and support levels. The bearish trend has been consistent, but the increased trading volume could indicate the potential for a reversal. Despite the current market conditions, long-term projections remain bullish due to Memecoin‚Äôs fundamental potential and market positioning.

Immediate resistance lies at $0.010 and $0.011, while support is found at $0.0095 and $0.0088. Indicators suggest potential stabilization as bullish momentum emerges. Memecoin price analysis on January 19 shows the Memecoin (MEME) is trading at $0.009743, reflecting a 4.15% increase in the past 24 hours, with a trading volume of $138,696,780. This recent price movement has improved sentiment in the market, with MEME ranking #186 on CoinMarketCap, boasting a market capitalization of $355,908,478. The circulating supply stands at 36,529,798,454 MEME, with a maximum supply of 69,000,000,000 MEME coins. MEME/USD daily chart analysis: Consolidation with upside potential The daily chart highlights MEME‚Äôs attempt to break above its recent consolidation range. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 44.26 indicates neutral momentum, with a slight upward bias. The MACD line crossing above the signal line shows that buying pressure is starting to emerge. MEME/USD daily chart analysis: Consolidation with upside potential Resistance levels at $0.010 and $0.011 are critical for MEME to regain bullish momentum, while support at $0.0095 and $0.0088 provides a foundation for stabilization. MEME/USD 4-Hour Chart Analysis: Gradual Recovery In the 4-hour timeframe, MEME demonstrates a gradual recovery. The Awesome Oscillator‚Äôs green bars suggest that momentum is building, albeit at a slow pace. MEME/USD 4-hour chart analysis: Gradual recovery The ADX indicates weak trend strength, underscoring the need for a breakout above $0.010 to solidify bullish sentiment. The SMA-9 at $0.0096 provides immediate dynamic support, aligning with the $0.0095 support level. On the 4-hour chart, MEME has shown signs of recovery after testing key support levels near $0.0090. The Awesome Oscillator (AO) indicates the formation of bullish momentum, as the histogram has turned green above the zero line. The Average Directional Index (ADX) at 22.69, however, suggests that the trend strength remains weak, leaving room for further confirmation of upward momentum. Immediate resistance lies at $0.010 and $0.011, while $0.0095 and $0.0088 serve as support zones. What to expect from Memecoin price analysis If MEME sustains its current momentum, it could target resistance at $0.010 and $0.011 in the short term. A breakout above $0.011 would pave the way for a potential rally toward $0.012. However, a failure to maintain support at $0.0095 could trigger a retest of $0.0088, risking further downside. Given Memecoin‚Äôs growing market capitalization and liquidity, long-term investors may view current levels as an accumulation opportunity.

Memecoin (MEME) shows mixed signals, making it a speculative investment at the current stage. The token trades at $0.0114, reflecting minor consolidation, with short-term resistance at $0.01157 and strong support at $0.01111. While the price has stabilized following a prior downtrend, broader technical indicators suggest market indecision. Despite this, Memecoin has displayed resilience, holding key support levels and gradually building momentum. Is Memecoin a good investment? Investing in MEME coins can be considered a strategic move for those looking to tap into the viral nature of meme-driven assets. These coins often see rapid appreciation or decrease in value driven by social media trends and community enthusiasm, which can lead to substantial short-term gains. The appeal of MEME coin lies in its potential to capitalize on the widespread attention and excitement surrounding viral tokens, making it an attractive option for investors adept at navigating the volatile crypto market and timing their trades to optimize returns. Will Memecoin recover? Based on the chart and the recent upward movement, Memecoin shows signs of recovery. If this positive trend continues, Memecoin has the potential for further recovery. Will Memecoin reach 10? Given its current price levels and market trends, Meme coin prediction is highly unlikely to reach $10 for Memecoin. Will Memecoin reach 100? Reaching $100 for Memecoin is extremely improbable due to its current price levels and the enormous market capitalization required. Such a drastic increase in prices would necessitate unprecedented growth and adoption. Does Memecoin have a good long-term future? Based on data and the recent upward movement, Memecoin may have the potential for a good long-term future. Positive market trends, adoption, and development will be crucial for its success.

Meanwhile, Memecoin is expected to reach a minimum price of $0.0100. The maximum price may reach $0.0245 in 2025. Memecoin historic price sentiment Memecoin was launched on 28th October by the renowned internet humor platform 9GAG and has quickly become a significant player in the meme coin market. The Memecoin garnered immense popularity through a unique launch strategy involving a fire sale and strategic social media airdrops to cultivate a robust and dedicated community. This approach proved highly successful. The fire sale raised over $11 million and sold more than 11.4 billion MEME tokens at $0.001 each, representing a 150% surge from what the team initially planned. Looking at its price history since 27th October 2020, MEME saw its first price pump on the same day, reaching a high of $0.02868. The MEME token price remained above $0.0020 until 7 November, when a minor pullback occurred below the $0.0200 level. By April 2021, the price skyrocketed, reaching an all-time high of over $0.05 as meme-driven tokens gained massive popularity due to social media hype and celebrity endorsements. However, following this rally, the price retraced sharply by June 2021, stabilizing around $0.02-$0.03. After a quiet 2022, Memecoin regained attention in 2023 due to renewed interest in memecoins and a crypto market recovery. A mid-year rally faced resistance, stabilizing at $0.015‚Äì$0.02, but by year-end, the price stagnated amid regulatory scrutiny and waning investor enthusiasm. In 2024, MEME saw price fluctuations: recovering to $0.026 in January with a crypto market surge, dropping to $0.012 by July amid weak sentiment, and rebounding to $0.017 in November with community-driven campaigns, ending the year trading between $0.01624 and $0.018. In January 2025, Memecoin‚Äôs price is hovering around $0.01128 ‚Äì $0.0116.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|MEME|SHIB|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-19 22:42:50

Elon Manipulates Trump (ELTRUMP), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELTRUMP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon Manipulates Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Manipulates Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Manipulates Trump launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.

The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

Trump promised to free Ross Ulbricht during his campaign days Speaking at the Libertarian Party‚Äôs National Convention on May 25, 2024, Donald Trump promised to commute the sentence of Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht on his first day in office. He made the same promise at the 2024 Bitcoin Conference in July 2024. Bitcoin enthusiasts still believe that Trump will keep his word and release Ross within his first 100 days in office. Bets on Kalshi even put Ross at an 81% chance of a presidential pardon, while on Polymarket‚Äôs prediction market, Ross‚Äôs odds of a Trump pardon are at 79%. Not to mention, his wife has hinted that Ross is preparing to leave jail soon. She posted on his behalf on his X account, saying: For my last monthly resolution of 2024, I intend to study every day and to get up to speed as much as I can as I prepare for freedom. Ross Similarly, on November 12, 2024, Ross thanked Trump, saying he could finally see light after 11 years of darkness. Ulbricht wrote a letter to Biden asking for a presidential pardon In 2013, Ulbricht was arrested, with officials having to close his Silk Road and seize over 174000 Bitcoin. Ulbricht was then charged with operating a criminal enterprise, conspiracy to money laundering and computer hacking, and identity fraud. In May 2015, he received a life sentence despite pleading for leniency. Years later, Ross wrote to President Joe Biden asking for pardon. He claimed he started the Silk Road with good intentions and simply pushed for his libertarian beliefs. He also promised to remain law-abiding when released.

Cardano‚Äôs ADA price has climbed past $1 due to its ecosystem advancements and strategic initiatives. At the same time, TRON‚Äôs price has reached new highs, drawing investor interest with consistent gains. Among these shifts, Web3Bay (3BAY) stands out, transforming e-commerce with blockchain. Unlike others reliant on speculation, 3BAY offers real utility, adding real value for its users and early backers. Web3Bay‚Äôs 6430% ROI Potential Shouldn‚Äôt Be Ignored Web3Bay is rapidly gaining recognition in the cryptocurrency world for its innovative approach to decentralizing e-commerce. This blockchain-based platform provides a secure, transparent, and cost-effective marketplace for both buyers and sellers, eliminating the hefty fees typical of traditional platforms. Additionally, the 3BAY token not only facilitates transactions but also offers special advantages such as discounts and governance rights.

Furthermore, Web3Bay is at the forefront of pioneering developments like decentralized storage and cross-chain functionality, establishing itself as a leader in the Web3 e-commerce arena. For those looking for an investment with substantial growth potential and practical application, Web3Bay represents an exceptional opportunity that is too good to miss. ADA Price Climbs Past $1 with Growing Ecosystem Cardano‚Äôs ADA recently surpassed the $1 threshold, part of a wider market recovery, with digital currencies gaining momentum as Bitcoin nears the $100,000 mark. Analysts see ADA potentially rising toward $2 amid a bullish pattern of development. Cardano is seeing major ecosystem developments, with founder Charles Hoskinson joining a new crypto policy team, signaling a significant step for Cardano and wider blockchain usage. The Midnight project further expands Cardano‚Äôs privacy and interoperability, tackling real-world integration and regulatory challenges. TRON Price Reaches New Peak TRON (TRX) has seen significant price changes recently, drawing the interest of both investors and market analysts. On January 17, 2025, TRX was trading at around $0.2444, marking a 2.82% rise from its last close. This increase is part of a wider positive movement within the cryptocurrency market. Ongoing development efforts and strategic alliances are believed to bolster TRON‚Äôs durability and future expansion prospects. Nonetheless, experts warn that the market is still prone to swift shifts, and they recommend that investors keep up-to-date with TRON-specific updates and broader market trends. In summary, the rise in TRON‚Äôs price to $0.2444 highlights its active presence in the cryptocurrency sector. Although the current trend seems favorable, those participating in the market should engage in detailed research and proceed with caution in their investment choices. Final Say! The rise in ADA‚Äôs price bolsters its appeal for the long term, though its future remains uncertain. TRON‚Äôs recent price surge demonstrates its tenacity, albeit without notable distinctiveness. In contrast, Web3Bay stands out with its practical use in e-commerce and its impressive potential for a 6,430% ROI for early investors, setting it apart from others. By integrating blockchain technology with global retail, Web3Bay is not only introducing innovation but also delivering real value where it‚Äôs most needed.

Musk AI Boost (MUSKAIBO), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKAIBO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk AI Boost can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk AI Boost could become the next viral memecoin. Musk AI Boost launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk AI Boost on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk AI Boost by entering its contract address ‚Äì 72pTcxNcaiTgNRSbCHaAPS97WFRdWwpfqbQdqEi7JP8J ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKAIBO.

Is this a good idea?,https://crypto.news/over-50-americans-sell-gold-or-stocks-to-buy-bitcoin/,"Most people who read about cryptocurrencies know that Bitcoin, due to its characteristics, is often referred to as ‚Äòdigital gold.‚Äô A new study reveals that more and more people in the U.S. prefer Bitcoin to gold. The GameFi platform ChainPlay conducted a joint survey with Storible. In their study, they asked 1,428 Americans about cryptocurrencies and investments in their lives. According to the report , over 68% of Americans now own some crypto. 77% consider increasing their crypto investment in 2025. 60% of crypto investors believe the value of their assets will double in 2025. The survey shows that 50% of crypto owners are boomers, while nearly 30% are millennials, and the rest are Gen Z. The report authors conclude that crypto owners get younger. However, it is not clear what digits were used as a reference point. The total lack of Gen X representatives in this report raises questions. Now that‚Äôs the real lost generation! Unfortunately, the report doesn‚Äôt specify what the groups of respondents were and how ChainPlay and Storible chose who to survey. According to other sources, only 13% of Americans owned crypto as of November 2024. It seems that the number heavily depends on the methodology. New crypto investment stats A survey revealed that Trump‚Äôs victory made a serious impact on people‚Äôs perception of cryptocurrencies, with 38% of respondents deciding to invest in crypto following the election outcome. A huge amount of these people, 84%, are first-time buyers who decided to try fortunes in crypto after the win of the pro-crypto candidate. Now, it‚Äôs time to talk more closely about the BTC investment insights found in the report. There are three main points. First, 51% of Americans allocate over 30% of their assets in meme coins. That‚Äôs an interesting statistic proving that a booming meme token market is no joke. The second point notes that one-fifth of Americans allocate over 30% of their investment in crypto. And, finally, third‚Äìnearly 52% of responders admitted they were selling gold or stocks to invest in Bitcoin. The latter revelation illustrates the tectonic shift in people‚Äôs minds. Over half of all respondents believe now that Bitcoin is here to stay, and it is safer and probably more profitable than gold or stocks. The preference for Bitcoin over gold or stocks was still a marginal mindset during the 2017 bull run. Nowadays, when various governments across the globe announce they will mine or stock bitcoins or use it for international payments, people look at Bitcoin without prejudice. On top of that, the stats mean that these people not only decided to buy some BTC, but they have made an additional step of dumping their traditional assets to invest in BTC first. According to the survey, over 51% of such people are in America. It shows the unprecedented bullishness of digital gold. You might also like: Mark Cuban chooses Bitcoin over Gold as economic hedge Bitcoin and gold The ‚Äúdigital gold‚Äù name has its grounds, of course. Bitcoin bears certain similarities with gold. Both assets are scarce and deflationary. There will not be more gold or more Bitcoin in the future. The amount of both assets is finite and isn‚Äôt likely to increase. You have probably heard about the preset Bitcoin mining reward shrinks in two once every four years (so-called halving). The gold mining is decreasing too, however, the speed at which the gold mining drops is far behind Bitcoin‚Äôs increasing scarcity. Experts speculate whether humanity reached the ‚Äúgold peak‚Äù point (a moment after which gold mining will be constantly dropping). In the Bitcoin case, the Bitcoin peak was in the first years, and then, production has always gone down, making Bitcoin scarcer than gold. When gold mining drops by a couple of percent, Bitcoin may drop by 50%. More than that, after every coin is mined, Bitcoin may be going to the moon, and the gold diggers may literally start mining gold on the moon, increasing the total supply available for the Earth‚Äôs markets. While gold gets increasingly scarce due to its use in devices, jewelry, and other products, bitcoins get lost or blocked forever. The speed at which bitcoins get stuck has been so high that in 16 years of Bitcoin‚Äôs existence, around 20% of all units are considered lost. ‚ö°Ô∏èMARK CUBAN: ‚Äú #Bitcoin ‚Äì it became a store of value, it‚Äôs marketed that way and has been marketed for the last 15 years or whatever it is and it‚Äôs gotten to a point of acceptance just like gold.‚Äù pic.twitter.com/w3h2fjEnps ‚Äî Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) January 4, 2025 According to businessman and TV personality Mark Cuban, Bitcoin became a store of value and reached an acceptance level comparable to gold. Both he and MicroStrategy‚Äôs frontman Michael Saylor point out that in contrast to gold, Bitcoin is easy to transport and generally control. Read more: Mark Cuban chooses Bitcoin over Gold as economic hedge Saylor once offered a thought experiment in which we should imagine trying to bring a substantial amount of gold or cash to the plane. The airport officers will treat owners as thieves. The same happens if we try to send a large amount of money abroad via a wire transfer. Saylor notes that, unlike traditional assets, Bitcoin provides owners with autonomy and control over their funds. Michael Saylor on Gold vs Fiat vs #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/9UNtVe0M8x ‚Äî Vivek‚ö°Ô∏è (@Vivek4real_) January 16, 2025 In another instance, Saylor noted that the gold era ended in the 16th century when other means of payment became more popular. However, Cuban‚Äôs estimation, in which he rather puts Bitcoin in line with gold, seems to be less maximalist as people still invest in gold while it‚Äôs obvious that it is Bitcoin, not gold, that is going through the blooming phase. The possible downside of Bitcoin is its higher volatility and shorter market history. However, as of 2025, its ups have always been more prominent than downs.

Stellar has seen a steady climb thanks to its appeal in international transactions, while Dogecoin‚Äôs price is on an upward trajectory, supported by major buying from big holders. Stellar is on the verge of hitting $0.50, generating enthusiasm from big-money players, and Dogecoin might soon reach $3, exciting market watchers. Amid these developments, Web3Bay (3BAY) is introducing a significant shift‚Äîa practical approach to solving real issues in international e-commerce. By merging blockchain with decentralized control, Web3Bay is setting up a marketplace that lowers costs, boosts clarity, and gives power to its users. With over $830,000 collected and a projected 6,430% ROI for early buyers, Web3Bay is not just following trends; it‚Äôs shaping the future of commerce. Web3Bay‚Äôs Blueprint for Tomorrow‚Äôs Global Trading Web3Bay is more than a marketplace; it‚Äôs a blueprint for the future of trading. While old platforms often put earnings before user experience, Web3Bay is rewriting this story. It combines decentralized storage, works across multiple blockchains, and uses Layer-2 scaling to create lasting infrastructure. Its hybrid payment approach, accepting cryptocurrencies and mainstream options like PayPal and Apple Pay, makes it accessible worldwide. Priced at just $0.0045626 in its fourth presale phase, the 3BAY token has already secured over $830,000. With each phase, the token‚Äôs price goes up, leading to a launch price of $0.1959‚Äîa potential return of over 6,430% for early buyers. The roadmap is exciting, too, with plans for an NFT marketplace and staking for 3BAY holders, offering more ways to engage with the ecosystem. As the presale picks up pace, Web3Bay is proving it‚Äôs more than just a concept; it‚Äôs a real answer to the shortcomings of traditional e-commerce. Early backers are not just investors but pioneers of a movement focusing on clarity, safety, and user empowerment. The Web3Bay revolution is here, making now the ideal time to get involved. Stellar Price Rises Amid Market Optimism As of January 16, 2025, Stellar‚Äôs price stands at $0.482793, up by 1.08% from its last close. The cryptocurrency saw a daily high of $0.514258 and a low of $0.4715, showing significant price swings. The recent price increase fits with overall positive market sentiment, as players look forward to favorable regulation and more interest from big investors. Stellar‚Äôs efficient handling of international payments keeps drawing financial and tech interest. Experts think Stellar might soon test the $0.50 resistance if the momentum holds. However, they remind potential buyers that the market‚Äôs unpredictable nature demands thorough research before any purchase decisions. Can Dogecoin Price Reach $3 Soon? Recently, Dogecoin‚Äôs price has seen notable movements. As of January 17, 2025, DOGE trades at about $0.4061, marking a 7.78% rise from its previous close. It touched a high and low of $0.4061 and $0.3688 on the same day. This uptrend coincides with overall market movements, including Bitcoin‚Äôs recent jump past $107,000. Significant buying by large holders, acquiring 200 million DOGE in just 48 hours, shows strong bullish sentiment. Analysts suggest that if Dogecoin continues this momentum and breaks past the $0.40 mark, it could aim for a $3 value. Still, the known volatility of the crypto market warrants caution from investors. Final Remarks! While Stellar‚Äôs durability and Dogecoin‚Äôs significant buys underscore the market‚Äôs speculative nature, neither offers the comprehensive utility that Web3Bay delivers. The 3BAY token is the core of a decentralized marketplace aimed at revolutionizing traditional e-commerce . Currently priced at $0.0045626 in its fourth presale phase, 3BAY presents unmatched growth potential, with a projected launch price of $0.1959. As Web3Bay continues to grow, early supporters gain both financial benefits and a stake in a game-changing ecosystem. For those seeking a high-growth opportunity with a real impact, Web3Bay emerges as the premier choice.

Particularly, data from blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock shows that Ethereum whales now hold about 43% of the total circulating supply of ETH. The imbalance in ETH holdings raises important questions about its implications for Ethereum‚Äôs price and market dynamics moving forward. Whale Accumulation Surges By Over 90% Since Early 2023 According to IntoTheBlock, the total concentration of ETH in whale addresses is currently at 61.09 ETH, which represents about 43% of the total supply. This marks a significant shift from early 2023, when whales held just 22% of Ethereum‚Äôs circulating supply. IntoTheBlock classifies whale addresses as those holding more than 1% of the total circulating supply of ETH. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bulls Eye $3 As Whales Scoop 200 Million DOGE In The Last 2 Days The nearly twofold increase in Ethereum whale holdings within just a year is a noteworthy development. Naturally, such a concentration of a large supply of cryptocurrency into a few wallets would spell doom for the asset, as it would mean a few players would be able to manipulate price dynamics as they wish. However, Ethereum‚Äôs case deviates from this narrative due to the unique nature of its ecosystem and recent structural shifts within the network since 2022. The sharp rise in whale concentration can be attributed to two major factors: the Ethereum merge and the growing appeal of ETH staking to earn rewards. The Ethereum merge, which took place in 2022, transitioned the blockchain from a proof-of-work (PoW) system to a proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism. As such, in-depth data from IntoTheBlock, which shows the 61.09 million ETH concentrated in only three whale addresses, makes much sense. What this means is that these ETH are mostly those locked in the proof-of-stake staking algorithm used by block validators on the Ethereum network. By locking up their Ethereum, ETH miners and large holders have not only reduced the circulating supply but also contribute to price appreciation by reducing the amount of Ethereum available for trading. Ethereum Holder Dynamics ‚Äì Investors And Retailers The increase in ETH among whale addresses has meant less ETH is available for investors and retail owners. IntoTheBlock classifies investors as addresses holding between 0.1% and 1% of the total circulating supply, while retail are those with less than 0.1% of the total circulating supply. At the time of writing, there are 42 investor addresses and they collectively own 15.2 million ETH, which translates to 10.77% of the total circulating supply. Keeping in mind that the three whale addresses do not do much with price dynamics, investor addresses holding significant but more liquid portions of ETH have a greater capacity to affect market movements. Any substantial selloff from these investor addresses could trigger a sharp decline in Ethereum‚Äôs price.

At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $3,225 and is down by 2% in the past 24 hours.

Its chairman Michael Saylor has teased another Bitcoin purchase is on the horizon. With Bitcoin‚Äôs value soaring, currently sitting at around $101,490, the company‚Äôs holdings are now worth an impressive $47.3 billion. Its calculated investment strategy is paying off, with a 69% return, thanks to its relentless accumulation of Bitcoin over time. MicroStrategy‚Äôs ongoing focus on Bitcoin comes as both big institutions and individual investors show increasing interest in the digital asset. MicroStrategy Massive Bitcoin Hoard Michael Saylor has been very open about the company‚Äôs Bitcoin plans. Every week, for 11 weeks in a row, he posted hints about the company‚Äôs Bitcoin purchases. On January 19, he shared a Bitcoin chart, signaling that the firm is planning to buy more soon. Just a few days earlier, the company bought 2,530 BTC worth $243 million that pushed its Bitcoin stash to 450,000 BTC valued at a whopping $47.3 billion. The company‚Äôs plan is part of its 21/21 initiative, a bold move to raise $42 billion through equity and fixed-income securities to fund Bitcoin purchases. Recently, the company announced the plans to raise another $2 billion through a perpetual preferred stock offering to fuel its Bitcoin buying spree. This strategy underscores a long-term vision where Bitcoin is not just an asset but the foundation of MicroStrategy‚Äôs financial future. Saylor‚Äôs Push for a U.S. Bitcoin Reserve Michael Saylor, who has signaled his willingness to join America‚Äôs new political era, is not alone in his vision for Bitcoin. He has repeatedly suggested that the U.S. should consider adopting Bitcoin as a Strategic Reserve Asset (SRA). In a framework he presented in December 2024, Saylor argued that converting the U.S. Treasury‚Äôs gold holdings into Bitcoin would fortify the U.S dollar and neutralize the national debt. His plan even included an ambitious goal to create an $81 trillion Bitcoin strategic reserve. According to Saylor‚Äôs framework, such a move could propel Bitcoin markets to a $10 trillion market capitalization. Also, the overall digital asset capital markets could expand to $280 trillion. Above all, it would position the country as the dominant global force in the digital economy. A Call for Bitcoin Reserves The MicroStrategy Chairman‚Äôs ideas are not going unnoticed. Industry leaders, including Coinbase CEO Brain Armstrong and asset manager Anthony Pompliano, have joined the conversation. In a recent statement, Pompliano urged the U.S. government to acquire as much Bitcoin as possible, emphasizing the situation‚Äôs urgency. He warned that if the U.S. does not act quickly, it could be outpaced by other nations in the race to secure Bitcoin as a reserve asset. With countries like China already taking bold steps to integrate Bitcoin into their economies , the pressure is on the U.S. to act or risk falling behind.

They incentivize word-of-mouth marketing by rewarding users for inviting others into the fold. Not only does this build trust, but it also fuels organic growth. Crypto thrives on community, and referral programs ensure that growth is a collective effort. It‚Äôs a win-win‚Äîusers earn rewards, and projects get exposure to new audiences. Meme coins, in particular, have embraced referral programs as a way to amplify their reach. From Dogecoin‚Äôs viral beginnings to Shiba Inu‚Äôs expansive ecosystem, the biggest players know the value of community-driven promotion. Now, a new wave of meme coins is upping the ante. BTFD Coin (BTFD) stands out as a project poised to redefine the game with its robust referral program, Play-to-Earn (P2E) games, and high-yield staking rewards. Alongside Neiro and Non-Playable Coin (NPC), BTFD represents the best new meme coins to buy for 2025 . With its explosive presale performance and promising features, BTFD is primed to lead the next generation of meme coins. Meanwhile, Neiro and NPC each bring their unique flavor to the mix, offering investors multiple avenues for growth and engagement. Let‚Äôs dive deeper into what makes these projects special. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin Revolution BTFD Coin isn‚Äôt just another meme coin‚Äîit‚Äôs an ecosystem built for growth, engagement, and massive ROI. With its presale already raising ove r $5.2 million and selling more than 64 billion coins to 8,600 holders, BTFD has captured the attention of analysts and investors alike. At its current Stage 13 price of $0.000142, the opportunity to get in early is quickly slippin g away. One of BTFD‚Äôs standout features is its referral program . It‚Äôs simple: users share a unique link, and every successful referral earns them rewards. It‚Äôs not just a marketing tool; it‚Äôs a way to grow the community organically while putting more tokens in the hands of dedicated supporters. The program has been instrumental in driving BTFD‚Äôs presale success, creating a snowball effect of interest and investment. But there‚Äôs more to BTFD than referrals. Its P2E game offers a fun and interactive way for users to earn tokens while staying engaged with the ecosystem. Players can complete challenges, unlock rewards, and grow their portfolios‚Äîall while enjoying an immersive gaming experience. Combined with staking rewards boasting an eye-popping 90% APY, BTFD ensures that every holder has multiple ways to profit. Let‚Äôs talk numbers. An investment of $ 35,000 at the current Stage 13 price would secure 246,478,873 BTFD coins. Once the presale ends and the coin is listed at $0.0006, that investment could grow to an impressive $147,887. Stage 13 is already over 96% complete, so this price won‚Äôt stick around much longer. What‚Äôs more, this coin is poised to hit $0.006 post launch, taking the ROI to a whopping 4000%. Joining the presale is easy. Just visit BTFD‚Äôs Presale Page , connect your wallet, input your details, and confirm the transaction. With its innovative features and explosive potential, BTFD Coin is a no-brainer for investors seeking long-term gains. Neiro (NEIRO): AI Meets Meme Culture Neiro is carving out its own space in the meme coin world by merging artificial intelligence (AI) with community-driven innovation. Its branding is bold, its utility is forward-thinking, and its potential has analysts buzzing. Unlike traditional meme coins that rely solely on humor and community, Neiro integrates AI tools designed to enhance user experience and engagement. One of Neiro‚Äôs standout features is its AI-powered trading assistant, which provides real-time market insights and predictive analytics to help users make informed decisions. This isn‚Äôt just a gimmick; it‚Äôs a game-changing feature that adds real utility to the project. Neiro‚Äôs ecosystem also includes NFT integrations and plans for a decentralized application (dApp) that leverages AI for gamified interactions. Crypto analysts are optimistic about Neiro‚Äôs trajectory, citing its innovative use of AI as a major differentiator. However, while Neiro‚Äôs tech-forward approach is impressive, it lacks the robust financial incentives like high-yield staking or referral rewards that make BTFD so compelling. Still, for investors who value utility and innovation, Neiro is a strong contender. Non-Playable Coin (NPC): Humor and Community at Its Core Non-Playable Coin (NPC) embraces its meme roots wholeheartedly, offering a lighthearted approach to crypto investing. Its branding pokes fun at internet culture while fostering a tight-knit community of holders who share a love for all things quirky. NPC‚Äôs charm lies in its simplicity. The project doesn‚Äôt try to overcomplicate things‚Äîit‚Äôs about humor, engagement, and building a loyal following. Its ecosystem includes meme contests, community events, and plans for exclusive NFT drops that celebrate the NPC theme. The project thrives on social media buzz, with users actively sharing memes and promoting the coin organically. While NPC has carved out a niche for itself, it doesn‚Äôt offer the same depth of features as BTFD or the innovation of Neiro. Its growth is heavily reliant on community engagement, making it a riskier bet for investors seeking long-term returns. That said, NPC‚Äôs loyal fanbase ensures a steady level of interest, making it a fun option for those who value community-driven projects. Why BTFD Coin is the Smartest Investment Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin stands head and shoulders above its competitors as the best new meme coin to buy for 2025 . Its referral program, high-yield staking, and engaging P2E game make it a comprehensive option for both casual and serious investors. While Neiro impresses with its AI-driven approach and NPC captures the humor of meme culture, neither offers the same level of financial incentives or growth potential as BTFD. Join the BTFD Coin presale now and secure your spot in what could be one of the most profitable crypto projects of the year. With every passing stage, the price inches closer to its $0.0006 listing value. Don‚Äôt miss your chance to turn today‚Äôs investment into tomorrow‚Äôs success. Make the most of this wealth-generation opportunity with BTFD Coin.

Recent insights from TradingView analyst Real CryptoRoy, highlight that the token has likely found a local bottom, suggesting favorable conditions for upward momentum. Recovery Signs Appear as Shiba Inu (SHIB) Stabilizes In December 2024, the token reached a high of $0.00003330, marking its strongest price point in eight months. However, this peak was followed by a corrective phase, during which the token‚Äôs value declined by approximately 44% to $0.0000186. Since then, SHIB has shown signs of stabilization, bouncing back to the $0.00002 range and holding within a tight trading band over several weeks. In early January 2025, the token briefly climbed to $0.000024 before falling below $0.00002. While these fluctuations posed challenges for investors who entered the market near the December highs, they presented potential opportunities for medium-term investors seeking to benefit from a recovery phase. According to CryptoRoy, January 13 marked a significant turning point when Bitcoin dropped to a yearly low of $89,000. Despite Bitcoin‚Äôs dip, Shiba Inu demonstrated resilience by avoiding a new low, closing above $0.000021 after briefly touching $0.00001978. The analyst viewed this ability to maintain a ‚Äúhigher low‚Äù as an indication of growing bullish momentum for the token. Key Resistance Levels and Potential Price Targets The analyst emphasizes that the digital asset‚Äôs ability to hold above critical support levels suggests the correction phase may be nearing its conclusion. He identifies $0.000025 as a key resistance level the token must surpass to sustain a bullish breakout. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 If this successfully happens, especially with strong trading volume, it could pave the way for a retest of its December high of $0.000033. Furthermore, a decisive breakout could trigger additional rallies, potentially pushing the token to new all-time highs. However, CryptoRoy underscores that broader market trends, particularly Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements, will help determine SHIB‚Äôs trajectory. The performance of Bitcoin has a direct impact on altcoins like Shiba Inu. Broader Market Sentiment Boosts Prospects The overall sentiment in the cryptocurrency market has improved recently, driven by Bitcoin‚Äôs recovery to the $100,000 mark for the second time this year. This renewed optimism benefits Shiba Inu , which reached a weekly high of $0.00002282 following Bitcoin‚Äôs rally. As the market outlook becomes increasingly positive, analysts remain watchful of the asset‚Äôs performance, particularly its ability to break above critical resistance levels. Investors are advised to monitor Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance (BTC.D) and overall market trends to understand better the factors influencing Shiba Inu‚Äôs recovery potential. The token is on the brink of a significant price movement, supported by recent stabilization and technical indicators pointing toward bullish momentum. While key resistance levels and broader market dynamics will determine the extent of its recovery, the token‚Äôs resilience during market fluctuations highlights its potential for a strong rebound.

Trump the Solana King (TRUMPKIN), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPKIN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Trump the Solana King can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump the Solana King could become the next viral memecoin. Trump the Solana King launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump the Solana King on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump the Solana King by entering its contract address ‚Äì 6oubDpkm3XF2x3r5vPZAhw2TABZgNrjmgwEqxUxLAYa ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPKIN.

Crypto strategist Ali Martinez tells his 115,00 followers on the social media platform X that the native asset of the decentralized oracle Chainlink appears to have broken out of a bull flag on the four-hour chart.

XRP is thriving due to positive economic shifts and legal victories, demonstrating its durability, while Algorand‚Äôs 20% increase underlines its robust market indicators and positive market reception. Amid these notable trends, Web3Bay‚Äôs 3BAY token stands out as a superior choice for both investors and pioneers. Unlike XRP and ALGO, which are primarily driven by market speculation and technical trends, Web3Bay offers tangible benefits by transforming e-commerce through blockchain technology. For those pursuing more than fleeting profits, Web3Bay presents a unique blend of practical utility and significant growth potential. Web3Bay Presale: A Unique Chance for Forward-Thinking Investors Web3Bay is revolutionizing e-commerce by building a secure and inclusive marketplace utilizing Web3 technology. Through blockchain, it resolves traditional system flaws, enabling a direct, decentralized, and efficient connection between buyers and sellers. The 3BAY token presale represents an unparalleled opportunity for investors eager to participate from the start of this innovative project. To date, Web3Bay has successfully raised over $830,000 and distributed 220 million tokens, indicating increasing trust in its future prospects. Priced currently at only $0.0045626, the token is exceptionally valuable, especially considering its anticipated launch price of $0.1959. With only a few million tokens left in stage 4, this presents a rare chance for significant returns. Beyond financial benefits, the 3BAY token serves a vital role, underpinning Web3Bay‚Äôs decentralized marketplace. As Web3Bay continues to expand and its adoption grows, the demand for 3BAY is expected to surge. Capitalizing on this opportunity now could secure the token at an optimal price before it garners broader market attention. XRP Price Achieves Seven-Year Peak Amid Favorable Market Trends XRP price has soared, hitting a seven-year pinnacle at $3.36‚Äîa 16% increase in just 24 hours. This significant rise is fueled by various factors, including a dip in U.S. core inflation, which boosts the likelihood of Federal Reserve rate cuts, typically favoring cryptocurrencies. The prospect of new spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that would directly own cryptocurrencies also enhances market optimism. Additionally, recent positive outcomes in the SEC‚Äôs lawsuit against Ripple have bolstered investor confidence. Analysts predict that the XRP price might climb to $4.40 following a Fibonacci extension pattern, although some long-standing investors might start to take profits following these sharp increases. Algorand (ALGO) Witnesses a 20% Increase, Market Valuation Reaches $4 Billion ALGO has witnessed a 20% surge in the last 24 hours, pushing its market cap back up to $4 billion. In the past week alone, ALGO has appreciated by 38%, showing robust bullish momentum. Important metrics like the Directional Movement Index (DMI) and the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicate strengthening trends and buyer dominance, which boosts confidence in the ongoing positive trend. With a recent golden cross in its Exponential Moving Averages (EMA), ALGO is poised to challenge significant resistance levels, potentially leading to further gains if the bullish momentum continues. Summing Up While XRP leverages favorable legal and economic conditions and ALGO rides on technical momentum, both rely largely on market speculation. In contrast, Web3Bay introduces real value by tackling global e-commerce challenges through its decentralized marketplace and the 3BAY token. With its successful presale, innovative payment solutions, and commitment to reducing fees and enhancing transparency, Web3Bay transcends typical crypto offerings, representing a pivotal shift in blockchain-based commerce . For those seeking innovations with substantial applications, Web3Bay presents a compelling option.

Crypto market observer Crypto Rand has labeled the token‚Äôs price chart as one of the most promising in the current bull market, citing its solid price structure as a foundation for further gains. Bullish Pennant Formation Suggests Upward Potential Crypto Rand shared his observations on Cardano‚Äôs chart, pointing to a strong rally in late 2024. This upward movement created a clear flagpole, which has since been followed by a consolidation phase represented by a symmetrical triangle pattern. This pattern, known as a bullish pennant, is widely regarded as a signal of continuation in technical analysis. It reflects the gradual dominance of buying pressure over selling activity, suggesting that ADA could resume its upward trend if the pattern resolves positively. $ADA continues consolidating the bull pennant, one of the best looking charts out there pic.twitter.com/iDGRzCKL7q ‚Äî Crypto Rand (@crypto_rand) January 16, 2025 In recent price action, Cardano rose 6.8%, climbing from $1.03 to $1.10. Currently , the token is approaching a key resistance level near $1.20. A breakout beyond this threshold could lead to much higher price targets, with Crypto Rand‚Äôs analysis hinting at the possibility of ADA reaching or surpassing $2 in the near term. Analysts Support Bullish Outlook for Cardano (ADA) Crypto Rand is not the only analyst optimistic about Cardano‚Äôs price potential. Market analyst Aboozar has highlighted another bullish structure on ADA‚Äôs chart, sharing his findings in a recent update. Aboozar pointed to a cup-and-handle pattern, often a precursor to significant upward movements. His analysis shows that the asset has spent several months in a period of accumulation, completing a rounded base during this time. The token is now consolidating within a narrow range above a key support zone between $0.80 and $1.00. Aboozar predicts a breakout to much higher levels, with a possible target near $3 if this pattern plays out. This projection aligns with the belief that the asset could reclaim its 2021 all-time high.

In his commentary, Sherpa highlighted that Cardano was one of the few altcoins to approach its previous highs from the 2017‚Äì2018 market cycle during the 2021 rally. Sherpa believes the token‚Äôs strong chart structure and market history position it well for continued growth, provided the broader cryptocurrency market maintains its positive momentum. The recent price action and technical patterns suggest that the token is well-positioned for further gains. Key bullish indicators, including the pennant and cup-and-handle formations, point to the potential for significant breakouts. While market conditions will play a critical role in ADA‚Äôs performance, the widespread optimism among analysts reflects the strong prospects for the token in the weeks ahead.

He took to the social media platform X to criticize these projections as overly optimistic and detached from market realities. Soni specifically targeted claims suggesting XRP could reach $100 or even $1,000 during the current market cycle. He dismissed these predictions as implausible and questioned the judgment of those making such claims. According to him, these forecasts indicate a lack of understanding of market fundamentals. Market Capitalization Analysis Highlights Unfeasibility The analyst supported his critique with an analysis of market capitalization. He argued that the token reaching $100 per coin would require a total market cap of approximately $10 trillion, a figure he deems far beyond what the current cryptocurrency market can realistically support. Additionally, he noted that an XRP price of $1,000 would push its market cap to an unprecedented $100 trillion, a valuation he described as entirely unrealistic. Highlighting the need for practicality in investment strategies, Soni advised against focusing on such exaggerated projections. Instead, he recommended established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which he views as a more reliable and proven investment option. He further described the asset as a distraction in the broader cryptocurrency space. Recent Price Movements and Community Sentiment Soni‚Äôs remarks come as the token gains traction, recently surpassing its all-time high. The cryptocurrency has been experiencing an upward trend, with its price climbing to $3.29 and a market capitalization of $189 billion at the time of reporting. This price movement has prompted some XRP supporters to adopt even more optimistic outlooks, with certain analysts revising their predictions upward. Despite the momentum, many within the community remain divided on the feasibility of reaching such high valuations. Some analysts have warned against inflated expectations, emphasizing that while the token‚Äôs historical performance has been strong, projections of $100 or more per coin lack solid evidence or realistic timelines. Diverging Opinions Among Analysts While some financial commentators, such as Linda Jones , believe XRP could reach $100 in the future, they have refrained from specifying a timeline. Other proponents, like analyst Javon Mark, have suggested even higher valuations, arguing that the asset‚Äôs technical indicators support the possibility of a significant price surge in this cycle. However, more conservative voices within the XRP community have cautioned against over-optimism. They argue that while the asset has demonstrated strong growth, its ability to achieve such high prices remains speculative. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Responses from the Community Soni‚Äôs criticism has sparked debate among supporters. Many have countered his claims by pointing out the speculative nature of Bitcoin maximalists‚Äô predictions, which often involve the eventual repricing of all global assets in Bitcoin. When pressed for further insights, Soni reiterated his negative stance on the token, describing it as a worthless asset with no long-term viability. He also predicted that XRP‚Äôs value could eventually collapse entirely. Despite these remarks, many in the community view Soni‚Äôs comments as biased, citing the token‚Äôs recent performance, which has outpaced Bitcoin‚Äôs in certain metrics. The ongoing discourse underscores the polarized perspectives surrounding the asset‚Äôs potential and place in the cryptocurrency market.

Elon Manipulates Trump (ELTRUMP), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELTRUMP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon Manipulates Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Manipulates Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Manipulates Trump launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Manipulates Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Manipulates Trump by entering its contract address ‚Äì HbYCEX5o56wcb5u6M8T3fkiaeFYgvQtxqBwt9yDoBoAV ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELTRUMP. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|DOGE|SOL|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-20 02:03:00

The leading cryptocurrency by market value briefly dipped below $100,000, representing a 4.5% drop on a 24-hour basis. ETH, XRP, SOL and BNB posted bigger losses, with ADA and DOGE losing over 10%, according to data sources CoinDesk and Coingecko. TRUMP, the memecoin linked to President-elect Donald Trump, which debuted Saturday, tanked 30% to $49, as Trump's wife, Melania launched her own memecoin, MELANIA. ""The Official Melania Meme is live! You can buy $MELANIA now,‚Äù Melania Trump posted on the social platform X on Sunday. The meme coin's website describes the token as a fungible cryptocurrency created and tracked on the Solana blockchain. The MELANIA token rallied a staggering 24,000% to a record price of $13, supposedly sucking out liquidity from the TRUMP coin, which was the most-traded digital asset on Binance over the weekend. Per some observers , the frenzied trading in TRUMP and MELANIA coins represents the FOMO phase of the bull market and could lead to a notable BTC price correction. Meanwhile, others like Arca's CIO Jeff Dorman believe the debut of TRUMP is a green light to all possibilities. ""To start, the pushback for 3+ years from both potential token issuers and potential investors in the U.S. has been ‚Äúregulatory concerns‚Äù. This is now completely eradicated when the President himself is both and issuer and an investor,"" Dorman said on X . ""TRUMP token just signaled to every company, municipality, university & individual brand that crypto can now be used as a capital formation and customer bootstrapping mechanism.,"" Dorman continued.

Following a period of price accumulation, the meme coin has shown signs of bullish momentum, with analysts speculating a ‚Äúbig pump‚Äù is imminent. This forecast comes after the asset quickly recovered from a downtrend earlier this week, gaining more than 9% in value following a 3.17% drop the previous day. Despite this recent recovery, the token‚Äôs performance still lags behind some major market assets. In the past week, SHIB has risen by just 8%, while other notable cryptocurrencies, such as XRP and Dogecoin, have appreciated by 43% and 18%, respectively. Nevertheless, technical indicators suggest a substantial increase in Shiba Inu (SHIB) price could occur soon, according to several analysts. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Technical Analysis A key contributor to the optimistic outlook for SHIB is the recent identification of a price compression pattern on the cryptocurrency‚Äôs monthly chart. Analyst SimpleTrader2018 from TradingView has pointed out that Shiba Inu has been moving within a symmetrical triangle formation for the past six months. This pattern began at SHIB‚Äôs low in August 2024, at $0.00001083, with the price climbing to $0.00003341 by December. The breakout from this symmetrical structure is crucial to the next phase of the asset‚Äôs price action. According to SimpleTrader2018, the meme coin is expected to surge if it can regain bullish momentum. The analyst predicts that a breakout could lead to a significant price increase within one to two monthly candlesticks, signaling a potential breakout in the short term. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Several analysts have supported the prediction of a major surge for Shiba Inu, with some estimating a tenfold price increase soon. CryptoELITE, another market analyst, highlighted the token‚Äôs positive technical indicators, asserting that the cryptocurrency could experience a substantial rise if the current bullish trend continues. CryptoELITE based this forecast on the formation of a symmetrical triangle pattern on the token‚Äôs price chart, which began after the coin‚Äôs surge to $0.00004567 in March 2024. Since then, the coin has been consolidating within this formation, leading the analyst to predict that SHIB could break out reaching a target price of $0.00023. Alan Santana , a market expert, shares a similar outlook, setting a target of $0.00023 for the token during the upcoming bull run. Santana suggests that the price movement could occur within the year, further supporting the notion of an imminent breakout. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Current Price and Market Sentiment At the time of press, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading at $0.00002276, reflecting a 0.63% decrease on the day. While the price has shown some upward movement, it is clear that analysts expect the cryptocurrency to experience a more substantial surge if it breaks free from its current price consolidation. CryptoELITE and Santana predict that the breakout could send the token to a new price level of $0.00023, a significant increase from its current position.

DOGE Millionaires Move Forward With $5 Million Bet For WallitIQ (WLTQ) To Rally 50,900%",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/dogecoin-price-set-for-parabolic-breakout-doge-millionaires-move-forward-with-5-million-bet-for-wallitiq-wltq-to-rally-50900/,"While Dogecoin (DOGE) is preparing for what analysts predict could be a parabolic breakout, the real buzz is around WallitIQ (WLTQ), a groundbreaking AI-powered platform that‚Äôs transforming crypto wallet management. DOGE millionaires, known for their early bets on meme coins, are now placing significant wagers on the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token , betting on its 50,900% rally potential to outshine Dogecoin price gains in 2025. WallitIQ (WLTQ): A Revolution In Crypto Wallets With 50,900% Growth Potential The WallitIQ (WLTQ) platform is setting a new standard in decentralized finance by combining cutting-edge AI technology with unmatched token utility . The platform offers users a secure, efficient, and intuitive experience for managing their digital assets. But what truly makes the WallitIQ (WLTQ) platform stand out is its potential to deliver a massive return on investment, with DOGE millionaires already eyeing a 50,900% price rally by 2025. At the core of WallitIQ‚Äôs (WLTQ) innovation is its AI-powered wallet that removes common pain points for crypto users. Instead of manually converting cryptocurrencies to cover transaction fees, users can pay gas fees directly with the native WLTQ token. This cost-effective solution also offers discounts to those using WLTQ for transactions, making it an essential tool for active traders. The WallitIQ (WLTQ) platform keeps users updated with real-time on-chain notifications, guaranteeing that they never miss important wallet activity. Its advanced security, with biometric and facial recognition features, provides top-tier protection against unauthorized access. WallitIQ (WLTQ) provides an innovative MVP build app that offers real-time crypto pricing through the CoinGecko API, allowing users to track market movements and view interactive candlestick charts. Additionally, WallitIQ (WLTQ) provides AI-driven predictive analytics that helps users anticipate market trends. As crypto markets move fast, having this level of insight can mean the difference between capturing massive gains or missing out. For early investors, holding WLTQ tokens comes with incredible perks, including reduced transaction fees, staking rewards of up to 180% APY , and access to premium features. The presale price of $0.0420 presents a golden opportunity to acquire WLTQ before its expected rally. To put into perspective, a modest $1,000 investment can turn into $510,000; a $10,000 investment can grow to $5.1 million, and a $100,000 investment could explode into $51 million. These numbers are staggering, and early adopters who secure their tokens now stand to benefit the most. If you invest just $1,000 today, you could be sitting on half a million dollars by the time WLTQ hits its projected price. This window of opportunity is closing fast. With DOGE millionaires and savvy investors rushing to secure their positions, the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale is your chance to lock in life-changing gains before the token price skyrockets. Why DOGE Millionaires Are Betting On WallitIQ (WLTQ) Dogecoin price predictions are currently optimistic, with analysts suggesting that a parabolic breakout could be on the horizon. However, even DOGE millionaires, who have profited immensely from the previous Dogecoin price parabolic breakout, are now moving a whopping $5 million into WallitIQ‚Äôs presale because WallitIQ (WLTQ) offers utility, innovation, and a clear path to sustained growth, something that Dogecoin lacks. With a CoinMarketCap listing and SolidProof smart contract audit , the project is fully secure and transparent. DOGE millionaires recognize that the WallitIQ (WLTQ) platform solves critical issues in crypto wallet management, making it a more promising investment for the next bull run. The potential for the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token to outperform Dogecoin is hard to ignore. DOGE millionaires understand that securing tokens at $0.0420 before the anticipated 50,900% rally could result in massive wealth creation. In contrast, even a parabolic breakout for the Dogecoin price is unlikely to match the WLTQ token‚Äôs projected gains. Dogecoin Price: Can It Deliver Another Parabolic Breakout? Over the years, the Dogecoin price has experienced several parabolic breakouts, often fueled by hype from social media influencers. However, DOGE‚Äôs recent performance has been less impressive, leaving investors wondering if the next parabolic breakout will be substantial enough to generate life-changing wealth. Analysts believe that Dogecoin‚Äôs price could see a parabolic breakout in the coming months, especially if the broader crypto market enters a bull cycle. Yet, even with a potential rally, the Dogecoin price is unlikely to match that of WallitIQ (WLTQ). DOGE millionaires know this and are diversifying their portfolios by participating in the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale. Rather than hope for a Dogecoin price parabolic breakout, smart investors like the DOGE millionaires have locked in early access to the WallitIQ (WLTQ) platform that‚Äôs projected to deliver 50,900% returns Conclusion: Secure Your Future With WallitIQ (WLTQ) Before The Window Closes The crypto market is on the brink of a major shift, and DOGE millionaires and savvy investors are already positioning themselves for the next bull run. While Dogecoin price could see a parabolic breakout, the smart money is moving toward WallitIQ (WLTQ) , a platform that offers far greater potential for life-changing gains. The fact that DOGE millionaires are betting millions on WallitIQ (WLTQ) should be a clear signal to all investors. The presale price of $0.0420 won‚Äôt last long, and once WallitIQ (WLTQ) hits the open market, the price is expected to surge by 50,900%. Imagine turning a $1,000 investment into $510,000 or a $10,000 investment into $5.1 million. The right time to act is now. Don‚Äôt wait forthe Dogecoin price to make headlines again. Join the ranks of DOGE millionaires who have already made the switch to WallitIQ (WLTQ). With its AI-driven solutions, top-notch security features, and game-changing utility, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is poised to become one of the most valuable tokens in DeFi. The crypto bull run of 2025 is fast approaching. Make sure you‚Äôre holding WLTQ when it happens. Buy now, secure your future, and don‚Äôt miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to create wealth.

Musk AI Boost (MUSKAIBO), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKAIBO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk AI Boost can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk AI Boost could become the next viral memecoin. Musk AI Boost launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk AI Boost on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk AI Boost by entering its contract address ‚Äì 72pTcxNcaiTgNRSbCHaAPS97WFRdWwpfqbQdqEi7JP8J ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKAIBO. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|DOGE|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-20 03:23:00

OFFICIAL TRUMP has quickly achieved a top ten fully diluted market capitalization in less than three days of trading. While the coin's valuation is high, the Tokenomics of TRUMP are dubious, with no observable utility and a high level of dilution over just 3 years. The big winner here is Solana, which is the blockchain chosen by the President (and/or his team) for his official memecoin launch. President Donald Trump is back. If there have been any doubts about '47' overseeing crypto industry-friendly regulatory policy, US-based digital asset companies may have just been given the biggest reassurance an incoming President can possibly give before being inaugurated; the Trump team has officially launched a crypto coin. In less than three full days of trading, OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP) briefly achieved a top ten fully diluted market capitalization: $TRUMP (CoinMarketCap) At one point on January 19th, $TRUMP had a $72 billion fully diluted market cap. This made $TRUMP briefly the most valuable memecoin in the market and give the coin the 7th largest valuation of any coin. We're going to get into all of the reasons why you probably shouldn't buy this coin in a moment. But before we get to that, please remember that the barrier to entry for meme-coin creation is virtually nothing. Because of this, there are literally dozens of ""TRUMP"" coins that could be purchased rather than the 'official' coin if prospective buyers aren't careful: Other 'TRUMP' Coins (CoinMarketCap) One certainly wouldn't want to accidentally purchase 'trumpwifhat' - a derivative of dogwifhat ( WIF-USD ) - instead of OFFICIAL TRUMP; each of which uses TRUMP as the symbol. So if you're actually interested in plowing into a meme coin at a $72 billion fully diluted valuation, make sure you know the correct contract address before you incinerate your capital. TRUMP is Not An Investment Anyone looking at TRUMP as an investment opportunity should consider that President Trump's own disclosure overtly says that the coin should not be viewed as such: Trump Memes are intended to function as an expression of support for, and engagement with, the ideals and beliefs embodied by the symbol ""$TRUMP"" and the associated artwork, and are not intended to be, or to be the subject of, an investment opportunity, investment contract, or security of any type. So, now that we know TRUMP should not be viewed as an investment, we can dive into the supply dynamics and holder data. Tokenomics and Distribution As far as I can tell, there is no utility for TRUMP whatsoever. In the past, NFTs released by Trump have offered token holders potential perks or privileges when purchased at a certain scale; for instance, meet and greet opportunities. However, no such perks appear to exist for TRUMP holders. Thus, the inflation of TRUMP supply and its distribution will likely play a large role in how this coin performs over time: TRUMP Token Distribution (GetTrumpMemes.com) There are a total of 1 billion TRUMP coins, 800 million of which are owned by ""creators and CIC Digital."" President Trump has an ownership stake in CIC Digital, though it is unclear how much TRUMP he owns through that entity. Regardless, at an 80% token allocation to the creators and CIC Digital, TRUMP has one of the more dilutive coin distributions that I can recall seeing in this market. TRUMP Emission Schedule (GetTrumpMemes.com) To be sure, there have been other coins that have launched with 80% of supply in lockup, but I don't know if I can remember seeing one where the total supply is unlocked within 3 years. Furthermore, the lockup periods begin in just 3 months and the emission schedule appears to show circulating supply doubling within 12 months. Meaning, TRUMP dilution is going to be quite quick compared to some of the other coins that I've covered for Seeking Alpha in the past. Early Trading Data Through less than three full days of trading, interest in TRUMP has been robust. There has been over $52 billion in total transfer value of the TRUMP coin and $32.2 billion in DEX trading value. The coin has quickly scaled to over three quarters of a million total token holders. However, most of those holders have very small allocations based on the Top 20 holder data: TRUMP Holders (SolScan) Again, 80% of supply is locked for creators and CIC Digital. Another 4% or so is held cumulatively by various centralized exchanges like OKX and Kraken. We can see an absolutely enormous percentage of TRUMP is held by the top 20 addresses. 88.5% of the total coin supply is held by just 20 wallets. If it hasn't been deduced by the reader at this point already, I'll be overt; I wouldn't buy this coin with free money. Like TRUMP? Buy Solana The biggest winner here is perhaps Solana USD ( SOL-USD ). While there is certainly an argument to be made that $TRUMP is simply cannibalizing liquidity from all of the other memecoins on the Solana Blockchain, there is no question the coin launch is bringing fresh liquidity to Solana through the President's non-crypto native supports. The price of SOL has been a large out-performer on the launch of TRUMP. Rallying over 40% from the January 16th close in just 3 days, SOL has made a new all-time high at $295 as of January 19th. L1 P/F Ratios (Token Terminal) And at just 82x circulating fees, SOL is the second cheapest L1 blockchain gas token when viewed through the price to annualized fee ratio. So if all of this activity isn't totally off-putting, I think the right way to play President Trump's memecoin on Solana is simply buying Solana. Closing Thoughts I don't think that I've made it any real secret on Seeking Alpha or on my Substack newsletter that I'm generally not a fan of memecoins. In my opinion, there is an element of financial nihilism that is pervasive through most of the memecoin segment that I don't think has been helpful to broader sentiment about digital assets or public blockchains as a legitimately useful innovation. But I do think the broader implications of TRUMP are compelling. On one hand, we could look back at this moment 5 to 10 years from now and see a memecoin launch from a US President - and subsequently his wife as well - as a clear sign of a market top. On the other hand, we could look back at this moment 5 to 10 years from now and see it as the certification of progress in financial technology. Readers can place their own chips on that one. For me, TRUMP is untouchable and SOL is worth some long term speculative capital.",SOL-USD,EN,0,0,SOL|REGULATION|TRADING|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-01-20 03:23:57

Koji Higashi‚Äôs company Diamond Hands is also facing issues, recently announcing a pivot away from their Lightning Network community node. The broken protocol that‚Äôs just 2 years away from being ready doesn‚Äôt seem to be doing them any favors. Still, the Japanese entrepreneur lamented and mentioned ‚Äúdespair‚Äù in an X post about the latest meme coin, Official Trump . Is TRUMP just another meme coin or ‚ÄòThe sh*ttiness of the industry‚Äô? Indeed, the massive political capture of crypto ‚Äî that was once supposed to be about separation of money and state ‚Äîis nauseating to anyone, like Higashi , who‚Äôs been in the game more than five years. But there is no rationality to manipulated markets. Trump, who has promised to free Silk Road darknet marketplace founder Ross Ulbricht ‚Äú on day one ‚Äù (amongst a plethora of other assurances) has now launched a website for his own premined, crypto just before being stepping into his White House role once again, tomorrow. The website for Trump‚Äôs stunt amusingly reads that the coin has nothing to do with politics. It further lays out the premined nature of the coin in small print at the bottom of the page: ‚ÄúCIC Digital LLC, an affiliate of The Trump Organization, and Fight Fight Fight LLC collectively own 80% of the Trump Cards, subject to a 3-year unlocking schedule.‚Äù Tokenomics show the asset‚Äôs heavily premined and centrally captured nature (Source: gettrumpmemes.com) Higashi noted in another X post that some people who used to support bitcoin are now turning away due to this meme coin. He also stated that ‚Äúthe people who originally got interested in Bitcoin got into it because they didn‚Äôt like this kind of thing, so it‚Äôs like a polar opposite world.‚Äù However, the coin‚Äôs team says on his self-congratulatory site, ‚Äú‚Ä¶ President Trump showed the world what a LEADER is made of.

The hourly chart also indicates a consolidation phase, as Bitcoin fell from $106K to $101K. Major altcoins are following a similar trend, and it remains to be seen how the market will react after Donald Trump‚Äôs presidential inauguration.

Every buy order is simply matched by a sell order. And after an initial spike, the price eventually crashes and the last buyers lose everything,‚Äù he posted, calling memecoins a zero-sum ‚Äì even negative sum after exchange fees ‚Äì lottery. Balaji said that memecoins should be approached in the same way as gambling in Las Vegas for entertainment purposes. ‚ÄúMost should buy assets that retain their value over the long run,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúIt is sometimes possible to add use cases to a memecoin, or to keep it in the headlines to keep its value aloft indefinitely. And we‚Äôve seen examples of that as well.‚Äù In response to the post, many asked Balaji if bitcoin was ever considered a memecoin, to which he argued that it wasn‚Äôt because of its use cases and decade-plus staying power. ‚ÄúBitcoin is the base layer asset of a blockchain with ~800 Th/s in hashrate across hundreds of datacenters worldwide,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúIt grew gradually over time, rather than all at once, and the mining issuance schedule limits how much can be sold by any one party.‚Äù Market interest in the official Trump memecoin has sucked liquidity out of other memecoins, with CoinGecko data reporting that the category has shrunk by 8% in the last 24 hours.

The meme coin was released just days before Trump‚Äôs inauguration as the 47th President of the United States. Critics have raised concerns that the timing of the release may be an attempt by Trump to cash in on his presidency. There is a growing concern that this move could fuel speculation, with investors rushing to capitalize on the hype before the value crashes. In light of this, attorney John Deaton has weighed in on the broader state of the cryptocurrency market, particularly in relation to ongoing legal cases involving major crypto players like Ripple, Coinbase, Kraken, and LBRY. Deaton, who has been heavily involved in filing amicus briefs for users, developers, and investors, expressed frustration with the resources and energy spent on these cases over the past few years. He said that many of these legal battles‚Äîparticularly the SEC‚Äôs case against Ripple‚Äîare non-fraud cases, meaning that the companies involved have not engaged in fraudulent activity, yet they have incurred massive legal expenses and losses.

Despite their efforts to cooperate, these companies are still being targeted by regulators. Deaton stressed that if a new ‚ÄúGolden Age of Innovation‚Äù is indeed on the horizon, the SEC should dismiss these non-fraud cases in order to allow companies like Ripple, Coinbase, and others to thrive without the burden of legal battles.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE|XRP|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-20 04:17:54

He emphasized that advancements in U.S. regulatory frameworks will be a major catalyst for this progress, enabling the stablecoin market to grow and achieve widespread adoption. According to McDonald, regulatory clarity will play a critical role in setting the stage for innovation, standardization, and increased trust in stablecoins. He expressed confidence in Ripple‚Äôs ability to lead this evolution with its USD-pegged stablecoin, RLUSD. ‚ÄúAs U.S. regulation advances, standards will evolve, innovation will expand, and real utility will take off,‚Äù he wrote in a recent social media post, underscoring Ripple‚Äôs readiness to drive this shift. Growing Stablecoin Market and Ripple‚Äôs Position The stablecoin sector has shown consistent growth, with a current market capitalization approaching $216 billion. Projections indicate that this figure could surge to nearly $3 trillion within the next five years, highlighting the expanding role of stablecoins in global finance. Ripple‚Äôs RLUSD, which debuted on December 17, has been introduced as part of this broader trend. The stablecoin was specifically designed to meet the rising demand for USD-denominated stablecoins, particularly in regions such as Asia-Pacific (APAC), the European Union (EU), and Australia. By leveraging blockchain technology, RLUSD aims to strengthen Ripple‚Äôs cross-border payment offerings, a critical area for global financial connectivity. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple‚Äôs Expansion Beyond Cross-Border Payments Ripple initially gained recognition for its blockchain-based cross-border payment solutions. Over the years, the company has expanded its capabilities to include asset tokenization, custody solutions, and other enterprise applications. Ripple Payments has facilitated over $70 billion in transactions, cementing its role as a major player in blockchain-driven financial services. The introduction of RLUSD aligns with Ripple‚Äôs vision to enhance its payment ecosystem. As a USD-pegged stablecoin, RLUSD is issued on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and Ethereum blockchains, offering flexibility and accessibility for users. Ripple aims to capitalize on the growing integration of stablecoins into the financial system by providing a reliable, blockchain-powered alternative for USD transactions. Implications of U.S. Regulation McDonald‚Äôs prediction hinges on the advancement of regulatory policies in the United States, which has lagged behind other jurisdictions in providing comprehensive guidelines for stablecoins. Clearer regulatory standards are expected to address concerns related to transparency, security, and compliance, ultimately fostering greater confidence among institutional and retail users. With stablecoins rapidly becoming integral to the payments landscape, 2025 could mark a turning point for their adoption and utility. RLUSD is expected to help drive this momentum, supported by the company‚Äôs broader efforts to redefine global payment systems through blockchain technology.

The selling pressure was so strong that Solana, $SOL , the cryptocurrency itself, fell nearly 20% in minutes. The trade went from a rush to the entrance to a rush to the exit.

This imbalance contributed to the decline in TRUMP‚Äôs price. Kobeissi Letter also noted that the selling pressure on TRUMP spilled over to Solana ( SOL ), causing its value to drop by nearly 20% in minutes.

Trump the Solana King (TRUMPKIN), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPKIN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Trump the Solana King can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump the Solana King could become the next viral memecoin. Trump the Solana King launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.

According to the press release shared with CryptoPotato , the network aims to onboard 25 million users and 25,000 developers, significantly expanding its community and technical contributions. Base also plans to scale its blockspace capacity to 250 Mgas/s, to enable faster and more efficient transactions, while targeting $100 billion in total assets on the platform. Base Unveils Ambitious 2025 Goals Base has outlined its 2025 strategy through five key focus areas. First, it aims to empower developers by creating open tools, including OnchainKit and support for AI-driven apps, to streamline app development and adoption. Second, it seeks to foster a robust ecosystem of on-chain applications, focusing on distribution, monetization, and improving core functionalities like social, trading, payments, and messaging. Third, Base plans to simplify user experience by ramping up its Smart Wallet, to facilitate quick onboarding, seamless app interactions, and secure management of assets and identities. Fourth, it aims to become a hub for global on-chain markets by increasing asset liquidity. ‚ÄúWe will decentralize, scale, and accelerate Base to enable everyone, everywhere to come on-chain. The only way we can build a truly global economy is by making sure it‚Äôs built on a decentralized, open platform ‚Äì and we are proud to do this as part of Ethereum and the Superchain.‚Äù Base TVL Growth The roadmap follows a milestone in November when Base hit $10 billion in total value locked (TVL) for the first time. The figure has since increased by over 50% as the TVL of the Layer 2 now stands at $15.2 billion, as per data compiled by L2Beat. Base is currently, the second Ethereum Layer 2 network trailing closely behind Arbitrum which has a TVL of $18.09 billion. The growth of Layer 2 networks played a crucial role in the Ethereum ecosystem last year and data suggests that this trend will continue going forward. For instance, in its latest report , Fidelity expressed optimism about the performance and adoption of Layer 2s in 2025, stating that these solutions are expected to build on the momentum gained in 2024, with a focus on reducing transaction costs, improving transaction speed, and enhancing cross-chain interoperability. ‚ÄúThe continued innovation in Layer 2 technology will make DeFi more accessible and scalable, potentially attracting more institutional investors and enterprises.

While signaling deregulation, I think the coin's tokenomics could hurt crypto‚Äôs short-term credibility. I believe the coin may give opponents arguments against Bitcoin as a U.S. strategic reserve, deterring institutional interest. 90% of Trump's meme coin supply is controlled by ""Creators"". Listings on centralized exchanges could increase risks for investors and damage crypto‚Äôs reputation. Trump‚Äôs meme coin launch may however signal a broader trend of crypto deregulation, which could create a more favorable environment for Bitcoin‚Äôs growth as a neutral, decentralized global reserve asset. Despite short-term risks, I believe Bitcoin remains promising as a global reserve asset, with deregulation likely to boost its long-term growth. In this article, I explain why I see the launch of Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúmeme coin‚Äù as a slightly negative catalyst for Bitcoin ( BTC-USD) in the short term but a positive one in the mid and long term. This belief is rooted in the fact that broader crypto deregulation (signalled by the launch of this coin) will ultimately support Bitcoin‚Äôs maturing as the dominant ecosystem. I will start by describing what a meme coin is and sharing my thoughts on the tokenomics of Trump‚Äôs meme coin - meaning its economics related to supply, distribution, and utility. Then, I will analyze the good, the bad, and the ugly of what this launch means for Bitcoin, in my opinion. Readers familiar with the crypto space may wish to skip the first section and go directly to my analysis of its implications for Bitcoin. This article is not intended as a recommendation to trade Trump‚Äôs meme coin or any other meme coin or blockchain project. All crypto projects mentioned are based on my own research and experience and should not be taken as investment advice. What is a ‚ÄúMeme Coin‚Äù and what did Trump do? A meme coin is a cryptocurrency inspired by internet memes, jokes, or pop culture, often created with little to no utility or underlying value. Its value tends to rely solely on community hype and social media trends rather than fundamental factors. DJT's trump tweet announcing his meme coin (X.com) Donald J. Trump announced on Friday the launch of a Trump meme coin, with ticker $TRUMP . This meme coin was launched on Solana USD ( SOL-USD ), a popular blockchain that competes with Ethereum USD ( ETH-USD ). As a crypto enthusiast, it took me a good 30 minutes to figure out which one was exactly Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúofficial meme coin‚Äù, as there are dozens of meme coins with similar names available on Ethereum, Solana and other chains. Interestingly, even Seeking Alpha features a ‚ÄúTrumpCoin USD‚Äù ( TRUMP-USD ), which is NOT Trump‚Äôs official meme coin, but rather another unrelated meme coin launched in May last year. The challenge in identifying the ""correct"" Trump meme coin is partly due to the fact that, at the time of writing, this can only be purchased through decentralized exchanges (DEXs). These are blockchain-based platforms that use smart contracts to facilitate trading without a central entity or control, unlike centralized exchanges (CEXs) such as Coinbase, Inc. ( COIN ). To make matters more complicated, the Trump meme coin is only available on those DEXs which deal with Solana, its underlying blockchain. An example of such a DEX is Moonshot, which is what the official website of the Trump meme coin suggests to people interested in buying it. Another popular option for Solana, which I personally sometimes use, is raydium.io. Using a DEX implies having a hot wallet that works with the Solana blockchain, and some level of technical understanding of the crypto space. Trump‚Äôs meme coin tokenomics: not great Trump's meme coin white paper (gettrumpmemes.com) What stands out from Trump‚Äôs meme coin ‚Äúwhite paper,‚Äù in my view, is that only about 10% of Trump‚Äôs meme coin supply is available for trading during this initial phase. The remaining 90% is locked by what the official website refers to as ‚ÄúCreators‚Äù and is planned for gradual release over the next 36 months. I find these tokenomics concerning, as they allow the ""Creators"" to potentially liquidate their holdings unexpectedly, which could harm investors. This type of setup is often associated with ‚Äú rug pulls ‚Äù in the crypto space, where creators dump their tokens, leaving investors with significant losses. A prominent example occurred earlier this year when a U.S. social media influencer faced backlash after her token was rug-pulled. That said, the creators‚Äô control over the majority of Trump‚Äôs meme coin supply does not guarantee a rug pull. This ultimately depends on their actions. Additionally, it‚Äôs worth noting that Trump‚Äôs meme coin website includes a prominent disclaimer stating that the coin is not an investment opportunity but rather a symbolic expression of support for the incoming U.S. president. Trump Memes are intended to function as an expression of support for, and engagement with, the ideals and beliefs embodied by the symbol ""$TRUMP"" and the associated artwork, and are not intended to be, or to be the subject of, an investment opportunity, investment contract, or security of any type. GetTrumpMemes.com is not political and has nothing to do with any political campaign or any political office or governmental agency. Personally, I don‚Äôt see the relevance of Trump‚Äôs meme coin to the crypto space or Bitcoin as having anything to do with its viability as an investment - it‚Äôs not, and I strongly encourage readers not to view it that way. What does this mean for Bitcoin? The good, the bad, the ugly. I believe Bitcoin possesses all the technical qualities required to become a superior global reserve asset: durability, divisibility, fungibility, portability, verifiability, and scarcity. Given these attributes, I see Bitcoin at current levels as an asymmetric bet on its potential adoption as a global reserve asset, complementing and partially replacing gold and fiat currencies held by major nations as reserves. Author's model for BTC valuation (Author's own work) My model for evaluating Bitcoin is outlined in the table above. In my most recent update , I revised the expected value range to $112,500 to $200,000 per Bitcoin . While I won‚Äôt dive deeper into the details of my model in this article, I encourage readers to explore my previous work and thoughts on Bitcoin, available on my Seeking Alpha profile . In the context of this model, viewing Bitcoin as an asymmetric bet, a critical factor will be whether the U.S. adopts a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve. Senator Cynthia Lummis has introduced a ‚Äú Bitcoin Act ‚Äù to Congress, and Trump has pledged during his campaign to support such legislation. In the following paragraphs, I will discuss the good, the bad and the ugly of how I believe the launch of Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúmeme coin‚Äù could influence Bitcoin. Of particular importance is its impact on the likelihood of the U.S. adopting a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve. The good: Deregulation A US president launching a meme coin just two days before his inauguration is something that I personally could have never imagined happening just one year ago. At that time, SEC Chair Gary Gensler was just barely conceding defeat in a multi-year battle against approving Bitcoin ETFs after losing a pivotal court case . In my view, this is a clear signal we are entering a new deregulation era for crypto. Donald Trump has campaigned heavily on overall deregulation , including deregulating the banking and crypto industries. The launch of the Trump meme coin happened the Friday before Gary Gensler‚Äôs official day of resignation - Monday, January 20th 2025. I believe this is no coincidence. The Trump‚Äôs administration has shaped up to be very crypto-friendly, with nominations such as Paul Atkins as new SEC chair and Gail Slater as head of the Justice Department‚Äôs antitrust division. I see the launch of this crypto project as yet another signal that this administration is going to heavily deregulate and incentivize the Crypto industry on US soil. Readers who, like me, trust in the market‚Äôs ability to self-regulate and view government intervention as something to minimize, will likely agree that this is a positive catalyst for both Bitcoin and the broader US economy. Of course, readers who believe governments should be heavily involved in regulation might disagree with my view. Personally, I‚Äôm not a fan of meme coins or any other blockchain projects outside of Bitcoin. While I observe the broader crypto space with interest, my exposure is overwhelmingly focused on Bitcoin, which makes up more than 95% of my crypto holdings. Despite my Bitcoin-first perspective, I view broader crypto deregulation as a positive for Bitcoin . I believe Bitcoin, as the only mature and truly neutral, decentralized blockchain project, is best positioned to outperform other projects in the long term. This is especially true in relation to Bitcoin as a global reserve asset that might complement the role of gold. The bad: meme coins ‚Äúinvestors‚Äù beware There is no doubt in my mind that Trump‚Äôs meme coin tokenomics are potentially a dangerous setup. While I believe the project‚Äôs website is very clear about this meme coin not being an investment, I still see a risk that some people might lose money if they put significant amounts of money into this meme coin. This might very well happen even if the meme coin does not go through a ‚Äúrug pull,‚Äù but simply stagnates or slowly declines in value over time. I believe the fact that the Trump meme coin is only available to purchase via DEXs has ‚Äúshielded‚Äù most investors so far. Many, in my view, are simply not savvy enough about the crypto space to go through the process of buying this coin via a DEX. However, this is bound to change soon. Coinbase and other CEXs have already announced they plan to list Trump‚Äôs meme coin. I see this as a significant risk that will put people in danger of losing money and ‚Äútarnish‚Äù the reputation of cryptocurrencies (and, by reflection, Bitcoin) at scale. As a proponent of free markets, ultimately I don‚Äôt view this risk as a fundamental issue - one could argue that reckless investors and gamblers should be aware of the risks they‚Äôre taking. However, I still see it as a ‚Äúbad‚Äù short-term catalyst for Bitcoin, as it could deter investors, particularly institutional ones, from engaging with Bitcoin. The ugly: A potential argument against a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Readers might believe that a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve is more likely to happen when the US president launches a meme coin. I disagree. I believe Trump might have handed his opponents a powerful argument against the adoption of a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve by launching his own meme coin with such short notice before installation. Trump's administration now holds control over the House of Representatives, the Senate, and the Presidency. Additionally, six of the nine Supreme Court justices were appointed by Trump, giving his administration significant influence across all branches of government. Despite this apparent dominance, I believe the passage of a ‚ÄúBitcoin Act‚Äù would still require committee reviews, debates, and amendments. Bipartisan support would also be preferable to ensure the long-term viability of a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve for the U.S. However, I believe this now seems less likely following the launch of Trump‚Äôs meme coin with questionable tokenomics. Political opponents may challenge the idea of a Bitcoin Reserve, questioning whether it should include other cryptocurrencies or arguing that Trump‚Äôs associates appear to have financially benefited from the meme coin‚Äôs launch. This could fuel opposition to Bitcoin adoption, framing it as a means of enriching Trump‚Äôs circle rather than a strategic decision for the U.S. economy. Polymarket - chances of BTC reserve in the first 100 days of Trump's admin (Polymarket.com) Polymarket, a blockchain-based prediction platform that accurately forecasted Trump‚Äôs election victory, currently places the likelihood of a Bitcoin reserve being established within the first 100 days of Trump‚Äôs administration at 42%. This is a notable increase from the 25% probability I observed during my last update to my Bitcoin model. However, I personally believe that the launch of Trump‚Äôs meme coin may have undermined the credibility of his incoming administration in the eyes of many. This, in my view, reduces the likelihood of Bitcoin being adopted by the U.S. as a strategic reserve and is a net negative catalyst for Bitcoin in the short term. Risks This article is not intended as a recommendation or suggestion to trade any cryptocurrency, including Trump‚Äôs meme coin. Cryptocurrencies, particularly meme coins, are highly speculative and carry substantial risks. As a crypto enthusiast, I was surprised to see the sheer number of Trump-themed coins currently in circulation. Beyond the challenge of even simply identifying and accessing Trump‚Äôs official meme coin, this type of trade involves significant risks, including lack of regulation, potential fraud, and extreme price volatility. Investors should proceed with caution and be fully aware of these risks. Regarding my thoughts on what Trump‚Äôs meme coin means for Bitcoin, I acknowledge that I could be wrong. Deregulation of the cryptocurrency space could lead to chaos in this space, potentially permanently undermining Bitcoin's chances of emerging as the dominant blockchain ecosystem for a digital reserve asset and scaring investors away from this asset class. Conversely, I may also be wrong in assuming that Trump‚Äôs meme coin launch is reducing the chances of the U.S. adopting Bitcoin as a strategic reserve. The Trump administration could move quickly to pass its ‚ÄúBitcoin Act,‚Äù and the meme coin might ultimately simply prove to be a lighthearted way to engage supporters and rally political enthusiasm. Conclusion I view the launch of Trump‚Äôs official meme coin as a slightly net negative catalyst for Bitcoin in the short term. Political opponents may use it as a case study to argue that crypto-related legislation, including the adoption of Bitcoin as a reserve asset, primarily serves to enrich Trump‚Äôs associates rather than benefit the United States as a whole. While I personally disagree with this assessment and view Trump‚Äôs meme coin simply as a fun way to engage with his audience, it remains a political risk that could undermine the likelihood of the US adopting Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset in the near future. On the positive side, I see Trump‚Äôs meme coin as a symptom and signal of a broader trend for this upcoming administration: deregulation. As a proponent of free markets, I believe this is a long-term positive catalyst for the US economy and for the crypto industry. I‚Äôm confident that Bitcoin will thrive in a deregulated crypto environment, emerging as the most mature, neutral, and truly decentralized blockchain - one that possesses all the necessary characteristics to become a global reserve asset.",BTC-USD,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-01-20 04:34:37

The altcoin has been consolidating just below its all-time high territory, and while the market remains in a mixed phase, the outlook is still positive. At the time of writing, XRP is down and is trading at $3.10 levels. Support Levels and Short-Term Outlook XRP is caught in a period of consolidation, hovering just below key resistance levels, particularly the breakout point at around $3.40. The support area is clearly defined between $2.52 and $2.94, and as long as this range holds, the bullish bias remains intact. A drop below $2.52, however, would challenge the short-term bullish thesis and may require a revision of market expectations. Market Structure and Key Resistance The market recently surged by 72% after breaking out of a triangle pattern, which was completed on January 13. However, the price is still below a critical resistance level, and this zone has historically been tough to break through. The all-time high remains a hurdle for XRP, but it is not surprising to see the market consolidate before attempting another push higher. Euphoria in the Market: A Sign of Potential Rallies There‚Äôs a surge in market enthusiasm, which could act as a catalyst for a rally in the coming weeks. While euphoria is often seen during the final leg of an uptrend, it is important to remain cautious as blow-off tops can form in such conditions, especially with Bitcoin and other major assets. Key Levels to Watch for the Next Upside The next important upside targets for XRP, if the support levels hold, are $4.19 and $5.00. The $4.19 mark represents a smaller Fibonacci extension, while the $5 level is a more significant target. A decisive move above these levels would set the stage for further gains and potentially a new rally.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-20 04:55:15

During this shaky phase for Pepe, many holders were nostalgic for its glory days in late 2023 and early 2024, when Pepe (PEPE) skyrocketed over 3,000%. Many ambitious holders looking to recreate this scenario are turning their attention to Remittix, a revolutionary new PayFi protocol that is positioned optimally to tap into the lucrative $190 trillion cross border payments market. So what is so special about Remittix and how will it stack up against Pepe in 2025? Pepe Posts 16.88% Increase In 7 Days Pepe (PEPE) has experienced notable volatility as 2025 unfolds. Currently trading at approximately $0.00002003, it has seen a 10.07% increase in the last 24 hours. Despite this short-term uptick, Pepe remains about 29.52% below its all time high reached in early December. The market capitalization of Pepe stands at approximately $8.42 billion, reflecting its relevance in the meme coin space. However, on chain analytics indicate that many whales have been reducing their positions, contributing to downward pressure on the price. The future trajectory of Pepe (PEPE) remains unclear, though it looks like things could easily go either way.

But their weekly gain is more impressive, with XLM recording 7.5% gain while XRP records 23.7% gain. Meanwhile, RTX token, the native currency of Remittix, a project revolutionizing the $190 trillion cross-border payments market is set to debut on major exchanges. Experts analysis capture this token with numerous use cases set to rival XLM and XRP. Stellar (XLM) Consolidating Following Bullish Breakout XLM broke out from a bullish pattern on January 15. However, the coin has been consolidating since then with long term holders accumulating more tokens, per on chain analytics from Coinglass. Also, netflow analysis shows that $20 million worth of XLM left exchanges over the past three days. This significant outflow, following a bullish breakout, is considered an ideal opportunity. Meanwhile, price history and technical indicators show that XLM could reach $0.65, a 25% rise if its daily candle closes above the $0.50 level. Currently, Stellar is trading at $0.4572 after an impressive 34% rise in the past month. Relative Strength Index (RSI) also indicates the token is below the overbought zone, providing opportunities for upside moves. However, reaching this price point may depend on the general market trend. XRP Rallies Amid Bullish Indicators XRP‚Äôs price could go further from its current price at $3.10, according to experts‚Äô analysis and on chain metrics. LbiDefi, an independent market analyst noted that the XRP‚Äôs RSI has bounced off the pivotal 50, a move often seen as the first sign of a bullish trend. Also, the token has reclaimed its daily moving average ribbon, an indicator for upward price action. The On-Balance Volume has also broken out, reinforcing the bullish view. ‚ÄúThe technical charts for XRP look exceptionally promising,‚Äù LbiDefi stated. Another analyst, Dark Defender, added to the optimism. He predicts XRP to reach new all time highs of $10.22 and $18.22 in the near term, a monumental surge from the current level. Its 600% rise since November to 3.40$ provides a foundation for future moves. Several reasons for bullish potential include the greenlight of a possible spot XRP ETF. The growing interest has seen XRP outpace Bitcoin in Google search trends for the first time. Additionally, increased adoption and expectations of regulatory clarity in the United States could contribute to XRP‚Äôs rally. Will Remittix Rival Stellar XLM and Ripple‚Äôs XRP? XLM and XRP are among the tokens with numerous utilities. Remittix also follows this pattern as it changes how international payments work by combining blockchain technology with traditional money systems. Remittix‚Äôs platform supports over 40 cryptocurrencies, allowing users to easily convert digital currencies like Bitcoin into fiat currencies such as USD and EUR. This creates a faster, cheaper alternative to traditional systems like SWIFT, which are often slow and expensive. Among its numerous advantages is Remittix‚Äôs open pricing. Remittix guarantees the recipient gets exactly what was sent by using a flat fee approach unlike other providers that include hidden charges. People and companies who wish for dependability and clarity in their transactions would notably benefit from this. Its use cases for businesses in particular how Remittix present a useful alternative for global payroll. Businesses can pay staff members cryptocurrency, the platform converts that into fiat and deposits it straight into staff bank accounts. This simplifies worldwide operations, lowers transaction costs and eliminates the complexities of conventional cross-border payments. Another use case that would make Remittix rival XLM and XRP is its security and user control factors. Eliminating outside participation allows the platform to provide consumers with complete transaction control. Furthermore, guaranteeing a safe and dependable system are audits conducted by reputable companies such as Solidproof and BlockSAFU. The team has frozen its tokens for three years to show its dedication to long term stability and establish confidence. Talking about the RTX token and why its price would outperform XLM and XRP, the coin in its ongoing token presale, has generated over $3.7 million. This means over 2 million of the token is sold with a unit price currently at $0.0221. Given its limited 1.5 billion coin supply, RTX appeals to driven traders. By 2025, experts estimate its value might explode and provide up to 100x returns. Investors that have keyed on this project have seen over 100%. Meanwhile, the token is set to increase in its presale price ahead of listing, providing anyone buying at this rate a 200% surge ahead of listing.

The overall crypto market capitalization has fallen by around 4%, now sitting at approximately $3.54 trillion . Let‚Äôs dive into the factors driving this decline. Trumps Accused of Pump and Dump Scheme One key event shaking the market involves accusations against Donald Trump and his team regarding a ‚Äúpump and dump‚Äù scheme. Over the weekend, Trump-backed memecoins, including the Official Trump (TRUMP) token and Melania Trump‚Äôs self-branded memecoin , launched and soared in value. Together, these tokens reached a combined market cap of over $15 billion. However, critics have accused the Trump family of manipulating the market for personal gain, which has created uncertainty among investors. Profit-Taking Hits Bitcoin Bitcoin, currently trading at $102,484 , has seen a minor drop of 2%. This comes after an impressive 10% surge since in the last weeks. However, short-term holders appear to be cashing in on profits, contributing to the current price dip. On-chain data from Santiment reveals that the 7-day Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio is nearing levels where investors typically book profits. Historically, when this indicator‚Äôs 7-day moving average (MA) reaches around 3%, a reversal tends to occur. Liquidations Add to the Pressure The market has also experienced heavy liquidations. According to CoinGlass , $1.18 billion worth of positions were liquidated in the past 24 hours as Bitcoin briefly dropped below $100,000. Long traders were hit the hardest, with $921 million in liquidations compared to $260 million in short positions. Binance recorded the largest single liquidation order, valued at $15.24 million. What Next For BTC? Despite the dip, Bitcoin‚Äôs breakout above $99,800 is seen as an important step forward. Experts believe the next key level to watch is $105,700. If Bitcoin moves past this, it could lead to higher prices. While some profit-taking may cause a pullback into the $99,100‚Äì$100,400 range, strong buying interest at these levels could reignite momentum.Using Fibonacci levels, Bitcoin‚Äôs next major target is projected at $120,362, signaling optimism for the weeks ahead.",News,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-20 05:26:13

Amid a month of notable developments, MicroStrategy's continued accumulation of Bitcoin and bold predictions from market analysts signal growing confidence in the asset's long-term potential. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market also saw the rise of OFFICIAL TRUMP (TRUMP), a meme coin tied to US President-elect Donald Trump, further highlighting the expanding influence of digital assets in mainstream discourse. As traders eye key resistance levels and lofty price targets, Bitcoin's journey into uncharted territory appears increasingly within reach. MicroStrategy's Bitcoin Crusade: Michael Saylor's Vision for BTC Adoption Intensifies MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor has once again demonstrated his unwavering commitment to Bitcoin, posting the SaylorTracker chart on Jan. 19 for the 11th consecutive week. The post hinted at another major Bitcoin purchase, marking another chapter in the firm‚Äôs ambitious Bitcoin acquisition strategy. On social media, Saylor wrote, ‚ÄúThings will be different tomorrow,‚Äù seemingly alluding to the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump on Jan. 20. This cryptic message, combined with Saylor's track record, has fueled speculation about MicroStrategy‚Äôs evolving Bitcoin strategy. MicroStrategy, already the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, added another 2,530 BTC on Jan. 13, 2025, valued at approximately $243 million at the time of purchase. This brings the company‚Äôs total holdings to an impressive 450,000 BTC, solidifying its dominance in corporate Bitcoin adoption. The company‚Äôs Bitcoin accumulation is part of its ambitious 21/21 plan, which aims to raise $42 billion through equity and fixed-income securities to fund its Bitcoin purchases. This bold strategy is part of MicroStrategy‚Äôs belief that Bitcoin is a superior store of value and a hedge against traditional financial risks. Michael Saylor has long advocated for Bitcoin's role in transforming global finance. His latest actions reinforce his belief that Bitcoin is the ultimate reserve asset for corporations, governments, and nations. Saylor has argued that the first country to adopt a debt-to-BTC strategy could position itself as a global economic leader. He has even urged the United States Treasury to convert its gold reserves into Bitcoin, suggesting that such a move could: Neutralize national debt: By leveraging Bitcoin's growth, the US could address its fiscal challenges more effectively than through traditional monetary strategies. Weaken adversaries: Converting gold to Bitcoin would diminish the value of gold reserves held by foreign competitors while strengthening US Bitcoin reserves. Position the US as a global digital leader: By adopting Bitcoin as a strategic reserve, the US could spearhead the transition to a digital-first economy. In December 2024, Saylor proposed a regulatory framework for the US that included the establishment of an $81 trillion Bitcoin strategic reserve. His framework also envisioned the digital asset market reaching a $10 trillion market capitalization and the broader digital asset capital markets expanding to $280 trillion. Calls for a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Gain Momentum Saylor is not alone in his push for Bitcoin adoption at the national level. Asset manager Anthony Pompliano has also championed the idea of a Bitcoin strategic reserve. In November 2024, Pompliano urged municipalities, state governments, and the federal government to acquire Bitcoin as quickly as possible. He emphasized the urgency of adopting Bitcoin before other nations capitalize on its potential. Pompliano echoed Saylor‚Äôs sentiments, warning that the US risks being ‚Äúfront-run‚Äù by countries that adopt Bitcoin earlier. He emphasized that the rapid accumulation of Bitcoin could yield massive economic advantages in the future. MicroStrategy‚Äôs continued Bitcoin accumulation sends a strong signal to both private and public sectors. The company‚Äôs success could set a precedent for other corporations and governments to follow suit. By demonstrating the viability of a debt-financed Bitcoin strategy, MicroStrategy is blazing a trail for others to explore the benefits of BTC as a reserve asset. However, this strategy is not without its risks. Critics have raised concerns about the volatility of Bitcoin and the potential consequences of such concentrated exposure. Nonetheless, Saylor remains undeterred, emphasizing that Bitcoin's long-term value far outweighs its short-term price fluctuations. As MicroStrategy continues to accumulate Bitcoin, the broader implications of its actions are becoming clearer. Saylor‚Äôs vision for Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset aligns with growing calls for governments and institutions to embrace digital assets. Whether the US will heed these calls remains uncertain, but the momentum behind Bitcoin adoption is undeniably gaining strength. With the inauguration of Donald Trump and Saylor‚Äôs cryptic hint of a ‚Äúdifferent tomorrow,‚Äù the stage is set for potential shifts in Bitcoin adoption and regulatory approaches. As MicroStrategy leads the charge, the question remains: will others follow suit, or will the US risk falling behind in the race to embrace the future of finance? Bitcoin Nears Monthly Highs as Traders Anticipate Price Discovery and Record-Breaking Moves In related news, Bitcoin is on the verge of hitting new monthly highs, closing in on a pivotal price level as market participants prepare for the next phase of price discovery. On Jan. 19, BTC/USD approached $105,500 on Bitstamp, fueled by bullish sentiment across the cryptocurrency landscape. Data from TradingView highlighted Bitcoin‚Äôs robust performance, with the cryptocurrency gaining 12% month-to-date. This bullish momentum has positioned Bitcoin as a favorite for long positions, just before the inauguration of US President-elect Donald Trump‚Äîa moment that has generated renewed interest in the crypto space. Adding to the excitement is the rise of Trump‚Äôs own meme coin, OFFICIAL TRUMP (TRUMP), which has surpassed an $11 billion market capitalization. This milestone has placed it among the top 20 cryptocurrencies, showcasing a broader positive sentiment for digital assets. Market experts and analysts are increasingly optimistic about Bitcoin‚Äôs trajectory. Prominent trader Pentoshi predicted an imminent return to Bitcoin‚Äôs all-time high, stating on X, ‚Äú$BTC ATH incoming pretty soon imo.‚Äù Another influential voice, Moataz Elsayed, known as Eljaboom, described Bitcoin‚Äôs current price movement as entering the ‚Äúbelief phase‚Äù of its cycle. Drawing comparisons between BTC‚Äôs present trajectory and its behavior during the last bull run, Eljaboom forecasted a dramatic price target of $150,000 this cycle. While the market is brimming with optimism, analysts are also emphasizing the importance of maintaining critical support levels. Daan Crypto Trades, a popular crypto trader, pointed to Bitcoin‚Äôs recent retest of the prior yearly high as a crucial area to watch. ‚Äú$BTC Clean retest of the prior yearly high,‚Äù he noted, adding that the $102,700 level must hold to keep the momentum alive for a move toward all-time highs next week. Amid widespread bullish sentiment, traders are setting ambitious short-term targets for Bitcoin. One of the most discussed predictions comes from Nunya Bizniz, who identified a target of $122,000 by early February. This projection aligns with a breakout from an upward trend line observed in Bitcoin‚Äôs daily price chart. Another notable analysis from Keith Alan, co-founder of Material Indicators, highlighted the significance of a cup-and-handle pattern on Bitcoin‚Äôs weekly chart. According to Alan, this pattern points to a $122,000 target, supported by key milestones such as: Double Top Resistance at $108,000 Psychological Resistance at $110,000 ‚ÄúBitcoin has reclaimed the key moving averages and is grinding back toward ATH Territory,‚Äù Alan reported on Jan. 17. Market Outlook: A Break into Price Discovery As Bitcoin flirts with its previous highs, the market is abuzz with speculation about its next move. With traders like Pentoshi, Eljaboom, and Keith Alan projecting new records in the near term, the focus has shifted to Bitcoin‚Äôs ability to sustain its upward momentum and break into price discovery territory. The convergence of multiple bullish indicators and high-profile endorsements further solidifies the narrative of a potentially explosive price rally. Should Bitcoin surpass its current resistance zones, the journey toward $150,000 could become a defining moment in this market cycle. Bitcoin‚Äôs recent performance reflects growing confidence among traders and institutional players alike. The upcoming inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, coupled with the surging popularity of crypto-related assets like the OFFICIAL TRUMP meme coin, adds another layer of intrigue to Bitcoin‚Äôs market dynamics.

A crypto price surge is unfolding as crypto whales make bold moves, fueling major gains for XRP, Rollblock (RLBK) , and XLM. XRP recently hit $2.49 its highest since 2018 after whales scooped up 679.1 million tokens worth $1.66 billion in just three weeks. Meanwhile, Rollblock , a groundbreaking GambleFi protocol, has already sold over 52 million tokens in its presale. XLM is also seeing impressive traction. These whale activities could be the spark for the next big breakout‚Äîare you watching closely? Rolling the dice: Why Crypto Whales Are Betting Big On Rollblock Rollblock is shaking up the GambleFi space, and it‚Äôs no wonder crypto whales are taking notice. Bridging the gap between decentralized and centralized gaming, this innovative platform offers the best of both worlds‚Äîseamless transactions and robust gameplay. With the online gambling industry worth billions, Rollblock‚Äôs vision is clear: redefine how players interact with games, rewards, and security. It‚Äôs no surprise this has sparked a crypto price surge around its token, RBLK. RBLK isn‚Äôt just another token. Designed to reward player activity, it transforms loyalty into real value. Imagine playing your favorite game and earning tokens for it‚Äîtokens that can be reinvested or held for potential gains. Crypto whales love utility like this. It drives engagement and retention.

XRP Whales Are Diving In: Here‚Äôs Why It‚Äôs Happening XRP has recently surged to $2.83, its highest since early 2018, and crypto whales are playing a big role here. Whales holding between 1 million and 10 million XRP tokens are steadily accumulating, with a significant increase in volume. Speculation around a potential XRP ETF listing in the US, along with optimism surrounding President-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs inauguration, fuels investor interest. Crypto whales clearly see the potential as they capitalize on this momentum. Experts suggest that as Bitcoin‚Äôs price rises, investors may look to shift capital into altcoins like XRP, further driving the crypto whale accumulation. With XRP‚Äôs price increase, the positive sentiment is contagious, and crypto whales are eager to ride the wave. Crypto Whales Are Making Moves On XLM And Here‚Äôs The Catch XLM is subtly attracting the attention of cryptocurrency whales, with factors outside price influencing their interest. Stellar has established a reputation for efficiency and scalability due to its rapid transactions and minimal fees. Cryptocurrency whales are investing because of their tangible uses, particularly in cross-border payments, where XLM may surpass its competitors. Its decentralized structure, together with its distinctive consensus mechanism, makes it safe and energy-efficient, satisfying the requirements of substantial investors. As an increasing number of enterprises and financial organizations investigate Stellar‚Äôs functionalities, cryptocurrency investors are actively acquiring assets, certain of its long-term development prospects. It seems they possess information that eludes us! Conclusion As crypto whales continue to accumulate XRP and XLM, Rollblock‚Äôs unique GambleFi protocol offers something truly groundbreaking. With its seamless blend of decentralized and centralized gaming, enhanced player rewards, and robust security, Rollblock is well-positioned for long-term success.

MELANIA also faced some scrutiny over its token distribution and rushed development, as 90% of its supply is reportedly held in a single wallet. Meanwhile, TRUMP, the Solana-based meme coin, spurred a lot of activity on the blockchain. It also boosted Solana‚Äôs native asset, SOL, and elevated NFT collections like Mad Lads. Additionally, the broader crypto market saw increased interest after decent gains in Solana-based tokens and a resurgence of Trump‚Äôs Digital Trading Cards. Melania Trump Launches Meme Coin The crypto world was shaken on Jan. 19 after Melania Trump, the incoming First Lady of the United States, launched her self-titled meme coin, MELANIA . The crypto reached a staggering $6 billion market cap in just two hours of its debut. This sudden rise led to a dramatic shift in the market as Donald Trump‚Äôs own meme coin, TRUMP, experienced a large drop in value. The TRUMP token‚Äôs market cap plummeted by $5 billion, while its price fell 30+% to $45.9 in just 40 minutes, according to CoinMarketCap data. TRUMP‚Äôs price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Melania Trump announced the launch of her token through a social media post , which was also shared by her husband. Data from DEXScreener revealed that more than 45,000 wallets participated in buying the token, which quickly surged to a market cap of $6.14 billion. The website promoting MELANIA stated that the token was created to foster ‚Äúsupport‚Äù and ‚Äúengagement‚Äù rather than being positioned as an investment opportunity. According to the website , the token distribution includes allocations of 35% to the team, 20% each to treasury and community, 15% to the public, and 10% for liquidity. However, blockchain analytics platform Bubblemaps contradicted these claims by revealing that almost 90% of the token‚Äôs supply is held in a single wallet. This raised some serious concerns about transparency and the token‚Äôs true distribution. Coinbase executive Conor Grogan commented that while MELANIA‚Äôs launch does not look to be a rug pull, it seems to have been handled by a less organized team compared to the TRUMP token, which showed signs of professional market-making. Grogan speculated that MELANIA might have been managed by a new team with possibly inexperienced developers . More scrutiny of MELANIA‚Äôs launch uncovered even more potential red flags. The creator wallet was reportedly funded through a transaction on Solana‚Äôs meme coin launchpad pump.fun. Additionally, the website hosting the token‚Äôs details, ‚Äúmelaniameme.com,‚Äù was registered only a day before the launch and did not have key cybersecurity measures. Crypto developer ‚Äúcygaar‚Äù pointed out that the site seems quite rushed with substandard front-end coding. MKT World LLC, a company that was established by Melania Trump in 2021 and sharing an address with the Trump International Golf Club, holds the intellectual property rights to the website. Google Searches Surge Amid TRUMP Meme Coin Hype The launch of President-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs meme coin, TRUMP, also drove search volumes for terms like ‚Äú buy crypto ‚Äù and ‚Äú buy Solana ‚Äù to record highs. Data from Google Trends shows that both terms reached a perfect score of 100, indicating peak search interest. Other crypto-related terms, like ‚ÄúCoinbase‚Äù and ‚Äúcrypto app,‚Äù also saw a sharp increase in search activity as part of¬†the buzz surrounding the current meme coin frenzy. Google searches for ‚Äòbuy Solana‚Äô (Source: Google Trends ) TRUMP is a Solana-based meme coin that very quickly captured headlines and divided opinions in the crypto community. The meme coin was initially met with a lot of skepticism due to the existence of numerous knock-off Trump-themed tokens, but the authenticity of the project was confirmed by members of Trump‚Äôs team after a promotional post by the president-elect on X. Trump declared the launch of his ‚ÄúOfficial Trump Meme‚Äù as a celebration of his vision and invited supporters to join his community. This endorsement sent the token‚Äôs price soaring to $67 and a fully diluted valuation of approximately $67 billion. The token‚Äôs meteoric rise had a ripple effect on the broader market as well, especially on Solana‚Äôs native asset, SOL . The altcoin surged to highs and caused it to peak at $270 per coin, boosted by the attention drawn to the Solana ecosystem by TRUMP‚Äôs success. At press time, the price of the altcoin stabilized around $239. Arthur Hayes, market analyst and co-founder of BitMEX, predicts that TRUMP could achieve a fully diluted valuation of $100 billion by the time of the inauguration on Monday. Hayes also suggested that meme coins like TRUMP could potentially bring political accountability onto the blockchain. He also promised to release an essay exploring this concept even more. TRUMP Meme Coin Boosts Solana and Mad Lads NFTs The Solana blockchain is experiencing a big surge in activity, driven by the launch of the TRUMP meme coin and a rally in its native asset, SOL. The increased attention even propelled the NFT collection Mad Lads to the 8th spot among the most valuable NFTs by floor market cap. With a market cap of close to $151 million and a floor price of $15,177, the collection recorded $472,748 in trading volume from 27 sales in the past 24 hours. This was still slightly less than the NFT collection‚Äôs performance from the day before. Mad Labs was created by Armani Ferrante and Tristan Yver of Backpack Exchange, and it¬†blends anime-style art with themes inspired by Peaky Blinders. Top NTF rankings (Source: NFT Price Floor ) The broader Solana NFT market also grew by about 15% on Jan. 19, with its total market cap reaching $714 million and trading volume hitting $3.39 million. Other collections, like Claynosaurz and Solana Monkey Business , also saw some impressive gains. Claynosaurz hit a floor price of $4,882, up 13.8%, with a market cap of $48.8 million, while Solana Monkey Business has a floor price of $7,956, which is a 7.1% increase and a market cap of $39.7 million. Solana-based tokens mirrored this upward trend on Jan. 19. Jupiter‚Äôs token, JUP , rose 33%, while Raydium‚Äôs token, RAY , climbed 10%. Despite their impressive gains the day before, both of these tokens saw double digit losses at press time. The impact of the TRUMP meme coin extended beyond Solana by reigniting interest in Trump‚Äôs Digital Trading Cards on the Polygon blockchain. The first collection traded at a floor price of $936.91 on Jan. 19, up 12%, with a market cap of $93.5 million and a trading volume of $2.44 million. The second collection also gained some traction, with its floor price rising 10% to $213, supported by 2,133 sales, a market cap of $22.6 million, and a trading volume of $940,000.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-20 05:37:27

Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal explained this observation in an X post on January 2, illustrating why XRP is still favored by newcomers in the crypto space. Despite the lengthy court battles, XRP has cemented its place as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. XRP is now valued at $180 billion, based on data from CoinMarketCap, and as of January 3rd, it has a 24-hour trading volume of $18 billion. Pal‚Äôs insights point to a unique attribute‚Äîits ability to resonate with ‚Äúnormies,‚Äù or average retail investors entering the volatile crypto space. Raoul Pal‚Äôs Take on XRP‚Äôs Unique Appeal In his recent critique of the growing AI agent craze in crypto, Pal contrasted the hype surrounding AI agents with XRP‚Äôs steady appeal. He dismissed the AI narrative as a short-lived fad driven by thrill-seeking market players, stating, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll come in and buy XRP anyway.‚Äù Source: X Pal attributes XRP‚Äôs enduring popularity to its simplicity, affordability, and association with Ripple, a reputable payments firm. Low transaction fees and a user-friendly approach make XRP an attractive entry point for those new to crypto, according to industry analysis. A ‚ÄúCult-Like‚Äù Following XRP‚Äôs loyal user base is another factor contributing to its mass appeal. In an August 2024 video, Pal described XRP‚Äôs community as having a ‚Äúcult-like‚Äù following, drawn to the token‚Äôs reliability and its role in cross-border payments. This support persisted even during XRP‚Äôs legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which led to temporary delistings from major exchanges like Coinbase. Despite this setback, XRP staged an impressive comeback. Between November and December 2024, XRP soared 475% , outperforming most other cryptocurrencies. The rally followed Donald Trump‚Äôs election victory, with market participants speculating on regulatory clarity for XRP under a new administration. AI Agents vs. XRP: Market Sentiment While XRP thrives on its simplicity and proven utility, the rise of AI agents has introduced a new layer of complexity to the crypto space. These unsupervised software use artificial intelligence to perform blockchain operations such as portfolio management and tokenized trade. However, Pal raised his eyebrows about their sustainability, claiming it to be a ‚Äúthrill-seeker‚Äôs game.‚Äù Logical barriers and the scarcity of applications also provoked questions regarding AI agent sustainability. XRP, on the other hand, remains to provide value-adding services, thus should not be only considered a speculative investment. The recent performance shows why XRP remains relevant in the portfolio of retail investors. Although extraneous fads such as AI agents may serve to mesmerize the general public temporarily, XRP is the only digital currency consistently demonstrating stable growth and constantly expanding its circle of recognition among traders.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,XRP|BUSINESS|MARKET|EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-20 05:59:58

The lawsuit filed Friday is one of the latest enforcement actions under outgoing SEC Chairman Gary Gensler. The SEC‚Äôs lawsuit focuses on three Helium-related tokens: Helium Network Token (HNT), Helium Mobile Token (MOBILE), and Helium IoT Network Token (IoT). The agency alleges that these tokens were sold as unregistered securities and violated federal securities laws. Additionally, the SEC accuses Nova Labs of misleading investors about partnerships with leading companies such as Nestl√©, Lime, and Salesforce. While Nova Labs claims that these companies used the Helium network, the SEC alleges that these companies were neither customers nor active users. The lawsuit states that both Nestl√© and Lime sent cease and desist letters to Nova Labs after learning of the allegations. The SEC is seeking civil penalties and a ban on Nova Labs from purchasing, offering, or selling any crypto assets that are considered securities. Related News: Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) Responds to ""CZ Coin"" Memecoin Rumors Helium founder Amir Haleem responded defiantly to the lawsuit in a post on X (formerly Twitter) today, accusing the SEC of waging a ‚Äúfailed war on crypto companies in the US.‚Äù Haleem also addressed the misleading partnership claims, saying, ‚ÄúWe have addressed this issue in the past and have worked with every company named in the complaint on Helium.‚Äù Haleem added that he was reviewing Nova Labs‚Äô practices, and had previously said in a statement that the company would implement a more rigorous logo approval process to avoid misunderstandings in the future. Haleem also viewed the case as a broader threat to decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePINs), arguing that classifying Helium hotspots as securities could endanger the entire DePIN industry. Haleem concluded his remarks by saying: ‚ÄúWe will vigorously defend ourselves and continue to uphold Gensler SEC‚Äôs record of miserable losses and outright lies. Not just for us, but for all DePIN projects. ‚ÄúHaving Helium hotspots as securities would endanger all DePINs. We will not allow that to happen.‚Äù *This is not investment advice.

This transaction, flagged by blockchain analytics firm Whale Alert, has triggered a wave of speculation within the cryptocurrency community regarding its potential implications for the market. The Mechanics of Whale Movements Large-scale cryptocurrency transfers to exchanges often hint at impending market activity. When assets are deposited on exchanges like Binance, it‚Äôs typically interpreted as preparation for liquidation. Conversely, withdrawals to private wallets might signal accumulation or long-term holding strategies. The transfer of such a substantial amount of DOGE raises questions about the holder‚Äôs intentions. Could it be a ‚Äúwhale‚Äù‚Äîa term for individuals or entities holding significant quantities of cryptocurrency‚Äîplanning to capitalize on recent price movements? Or is this a strategic move for other financial maneuvers, such as portfolio diversification or liquidity needs? A Trend of Significant Transfers This transaction is not an isolated event. Over the past 48 hours, Dogecoin has seen a flurry of high-value movements- two transfers totaling over 51.9 million DOGE ($21.3 million) was shifted from Robinhood to Coinbase, hinting at potential trading or liquidity adjustments. Likewise, another substantial transfer of 80.4 million DOGE ($33.1 million) was moved from Robinhood to an unidentified wallet, suggesting possible long-term holding intentions. Even larger movements were recorded, with 400 million DOGE ($154.3 million) and 200 million DOGE ($77.3 million) exchanged between anonymous wallets. These transactions underscore heightened activity surrounding Dogecoin, a trend that often precedes price volatility. Dogecoin‚Äôs Recent Price Action Despite the excitement around these transfers, Dogecoin‚Äôs price has experienced a mixed trajectory. Over the past 24 hours, DOGE has dropped by 4.37%, likely driven by market profit-taking following a broader rally in meme coins. However, the cryptocurrency remains up 15.73% over the past week, showcasing its resilience amidst market turbulence. This price behavior aligns with a broader trend in the cryptocurrency market, where meme coins frequently experience sharp spikes followed by equally rapid corrections as traders seek to lock in profits.

The community is left to speculate whether the whales are cashing out. The transfer to Binance could indicate a sell-off, potentially placing downward pressure on DOGE‚Äôs price. Alternatively, such movements reflect strategic reallocations by long-term holders confident in Dogecoin‚Äôs future potential. The broader implications of these transactions remain uncertain, but they remind us of whales‚Äô significant influence in the cryptocurrency market. A Dynamic Market Landscape Dogecoin , often considered a meme coin, continues to capture the spotlight with its massive transactions and active trading patterns. While recent price dips may concern some investors, the broader trend of large-scale movements suggests ongoing interest and engagement from major players. As the market watches for the next move, one thing is certain: the Dogecoin story is far from over, and its loyal community remains as engaged as ever in deciphering its twists and turns.

The largest cryptocurrency touched $109,333 on Binance. Trump mentioned the asset's record performance in a Sunday speech alongside gains in the broader U.S. stock market. ""Since the election, the stock market has surged and small business optimism has soared a record 41 points to a 39-year high. Bitcoin has shattered one record high after another,"" Trump said. BTC reversed losses from earlier in the day when it fell to nearly $100,000 from a high over $102,000 on Sunday as first lady Melania Trump issued a memecoin, drawing liquidity away from major assets. Trump has been vocal about his support for cryptocurrencies during his campaign. Promises like making the U.S. the ""crypto capital of the planet"" and creating a ""strategic national bitcoin reserve"" have fueled investor optimism. ""Bitcoin reached $108K while other cryptocurrencies have rapidly pumped on the eve of the US presidential inauguration, with hopes that new policies and regulators will send the price of BTC much further this year as the US economy continues to show strength in the long term,"" Ben El-Baz, Managing Director of HashKey Global, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. ""The forward momentum has been further accelerated by the launch of the TRUMP and MELANIA memecoins which have attracted more retail users, and hopes that Trump will prioritize and reaffirm his commitment to the crypto industry."" ""Designating crypto as a national priority and launching TRUMP coin over the past few days have been strong, positive signals. As the main bellwether for the industry, Bitcoin's surge was expected and is likely to continue through the week,"" Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE, said in a Telegram message. Year-end bitcoin targets range from $185,000 to as high as $250,000, as CoinDesk previously reported . Meanwhile, bitcoin dominance has started to trend higher and is now approaching 60%, the highest level since Dec. 20.

Over the day, the coin gained 220% with an FDV of $62 billion. Donald Trump's Coin Price and Growth At the time of writing, the asset is trading at $61,9 with a market capitalization of $12.1 billion. TRUMP has already climbed to the 16th position in the ranking of the largest cryptocurrencies, ahead of TON and SHIB. The daily trading volume has reached almost $1 billion. The excitement around TRUMP occurs against the background of relative stagnation in the rest of the market of digital assets. However, a surge of activity in the Solana network ensured SOL's growth to new historical highs - the coin is now trading at peak values around $286. Centralized exchanges including Binance, Bybit, HTX, Gate and Bitget have all floated the token. DEX on Solana are also recording record highs. Daily trading volume on the network holds at $21 billion for the second day in a row. TRUMP's Coin Tokenomics: Emission and Allocation The available supply on launch day was 200 million TRUMP for a total issuance of 1 billion coins. According to the project's website, the tokens are planned to be unlocked gradually over three years. A total of 100 million TRUMP is earmarked for public distribution, with another 100 million coins to provide liquidity. The remaining 800 million TRUMP are earmarked for ‚Äúcreators‚Äù and CIC Digital, a company associated with Trump's NFT project. The first unlock is scheduled to take place in three months. Crypto investor and host of The Wolf Of All Streets podcast Scott Melker said Trump's meme coin is a ‚Äúsignificant benefit‚Äù for cryptocurrency but a ‚Äúdetriment to humanity.‚Äù $TRUMP First take.

If the interest in the figure of Donald Trump remains high, the volatility of the projects will be significant. Positive news background raises the price, while any negative event can sharply collapse the rates. It is recommended not to ‚Äúbuy on highs‚Äù and not follow the global trends of the crypto market. Professional traders advise using risk management and diversification, because a sudden ‚Äúdump‚Äù can completely nullify the deposit of an unprepared investor. The future of Trump's coin Arkham Intelligence suggested that if the firms CIC Digital and Fight Fight Fight, which together own 80% of the TRUMP issue, are actually owned by the president-elect, then his fortune has multiplied several times over.

In response to criticism and concerns from the community, crypto-enthusiast Eric Scott stated that 80% of the supply in the hands of a politician makes TRUMP one of the ‚Äúsafest coins‚Äù to hold.

Regardless of the short-term correction, Bitcoin price today is up No data found for bitcoin on 49 minutes ago% and hit a new all-time high (ATH) of $110,000.

Polymarket data shows that the odds of a strategic Bitcoin reserve approval have shot up from 37% to 59% in just a few minutes. Will Trump create Bitcoin reserve in first 100 days? Why Bitcoin Price Today Is Up 8% as BTC Hits New ATH? Bitcoin price today set up a new ATH of $110,000 and trades at No data found for bitcoin on 49 minutes ago after shooting up No data found for bitcoin on 49 minutes ago%. This spike in buying pressure could be attributed to investors pulling out of the TRUMP coin and reinvesting profits into a more risk-averse asset like Bitcoin. Moreover, the long-term outlook of BTC remains bullish, with higher highs and higher lows on the daily and weekly charts, adding credence to the recent spike in buying pressure and a new ATH. The second reason for this uptrend could be the Presideent-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs inauguration, which is scheduled to take place today. Investors may have considered the recent launch of a meme coin on Solana as a show of Trump‚Äôs support for the crypto space. Additionally, it wouldn‚Äôt be surprising that capital is rotating back into BTC in anticipation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve.

Crypto experts and industry leaders raise concerns over politicians‚Äô unfair market advantage, highlighting the lack of regulatory clarity. Pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton underscored the priority of memecoin regulation over other concerns, including SAB 121 legislation. Trump‚Äôs surprise launch of the memecoin ahead of his presidential inauguration has ignited a heated discussion about the pressing need for clearer regulations in the crypto space. XRP Lawyer John Deaton Pushes for Urgent Memecoin Regulation In a recent X post , John Deaton stressed the urgency in implementing memecoin regulations prompted by the frenzy surrounding Trump‚Äôs memecoin launch. Deaton stated that he previously believed SAB 121 stablecoin legislation , CFTC oversight, and tax reform were the immediate areas requiring attention from the Trump administration and Congress. Correcting his earlier stance, he wrote, ‚ÄúI stand corrected: it‚Äôs Meme Coin Regulation.‚Äù Backlash Grows Over Memecoin Frenzy Notably, Nic Carter, who calls himself a devoted Trump supporter, expressed his disagreement with Trump‚Äôs memecoin launch. Calling the move unreasonable, Nic Carter stated, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre plumbing new depths of idiocy with the memecoin launch.‚Äù Another significant personality who urged action for memecoin regulation is the US representative Ro Khanna. He recommended banning elected officials from owning highly speculative memecoins. Reflecting on the TRUMP memecoin launch , Khanna wrote: Elected officials must be barred from having meme coins by law. Meme coins are highly speculative and like gambling must be regulated by the SEC. They are neither neutral money (not controlled by insiders) nor platforms for innovation. Trump‚Äôs Memecoin Promotion Impacts XRP Lawsuit Deaton‚Äôs push for memecoin regulations follows concerns raised by XRP advocate Bill Morgan about the potential TRUMP‚Äôs impact on XRP lawsuit . According to Morgan, the incoming President‚Äôs unprecedented launch of the token emphasizes the need for clear crypto guidelines. With XRP lawyer like Deaton and Morgan expressing concerns over the TRUMP token launch, its impact extends beyond the crypto market. As the situation unfolds, it is clear that the urge for clear regulations has never been more pressing.

This idea could change the way politics and cryptocurrency interact. But how would it work, and what does it mean for the future of money? Trump‚Äôs $59 Billion Crypto Fortune Balaji Srinivasan suggests that Trump‚Äôs net worth could be redefined if he shifts most of his wealth into cryptocurrency. Currently valued at $59 billion, Trump could, in theory, hold 90% of his fortune in crypto, just as many early Bitcoin and Ethereum investors did. FIRST CRYPTO PRESIDENT Overnight, the vast majority of the net worth ($59B) of the next President of the United States is now held in cryptocurrency. This will hold true even with a 90% drop. What are the implications? 1) First, President Trump just went from crypto being‚Ä¶ https://t.co/yh3bSytZx4 ‚Äî Balaji (@balajis) January 19, 2025 Srinivasan warns that this isn‚Äôt just a U.S. phenomenon. As fiat currencies lose their value over time, millions across the globe will likely face similar transitions to crypto wealth. Politicians, celebrities, and influencers worldwide watch this change closely. The future of money might be digital, and Trump‚Äôs crypto journey could be the first of its kind on the global stage. Can TRUMP Token Will Survive? The big question is whether the TRUMP token will retain its value. History has shown that celebrity-backed coins tend to fall quickly. However, Trump is no ordinary celebrity. Trump has over 100 million followers and continues to receive constant media attentio Unlike other celebrity-backed tokens that failed to keep their value, the TRUMP token could benefit from Trump‚Äôs powerful influence, provided it manages to keep the public‚Äôs interest. Airdrop Proposal: $100 per Voter? One of the most eye-catching elements of Srinivasan‚Äôs proposal is the potential airdrop of TRUMP tokens to all 77 million Trump voters. If Trump were to give $100 worth of TRUMP to each supporter, it would cost him roughly $7.7 billion. While this amount might seem large, it could make sense given the rapid growth of the TRUMP token‚Äôs value. By offering free tokens, Trump could not only gain more support but also strengthen his base, turning loyal voters into even more dedicated followers. Legal and Ethical Considerations Of course, there are some legal and ethical concerns that could arise from such a move. While it‚Äôs common for politicians to ask for donations, no politician has attempted to send an airdrop of cryptocurrency to millions of people. Srinivasan believes Trump could overcome these challenges by presenting the airdrop as a personal, voluntary exchange.",News,EN,0,0,AIRDROP|EXCHANGE|MINING|REGULATION|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-20 07:37:47

This cryptocurrency niche, where projects ride on narrative, hype, and community support rather than the utility anchor for traditional crypto projects, has become a favorite investment niche for crypto investors. Following the recent record-breaking move of Bitcoin above $100,000 and other favorable crypto considerations globally, the Meme coin market is set for another long ride in green. One of the Meme coins tipped to be a goldmine in 2025 is Chill Drone ( $CHONE ). A uniquely positioned meme coin with a narrative that ticks every box of its predecessors like $DOGE and $SHIB.

Chill Drone goes beyond just a meme coin to a movement that hopes to inject a new lifestyle into the crypto market, where it creates a strong community of people separated from the pressure and endless grind of domination. It is a community of holders embracing relaxation, balance, tranquility, creativity, humor, and fun. What Makes $CHONE Appealing? Dogecoin and Shiba Inu had a good narrative, humor, community, and shareability in common, which contributed to their widespread success. The case is not entirely different with Chill Drone, as it shares all of these features, which positions it for similar success. Top of the list of $CHONE‚Äôs unique appeal is its meme-worthy vibes. Social media virality is a big part of successful meme coins. Chill Drone‚Äôs quirky drone character with half-open eyes and a serene philosophy practically markets itself. Its relatable philosophy is also an appealing factor. ‚ÄúChill out‚Äù is just the statement a lot of people want to hear in a fast-paced and chaotic world. High relatability makes it easier for virality in the world of meme coins. $CHONE isn‚Äôt screaming ‚Äúto the moon,‚Äù rather it‚Äôs whispering ‚ÄúEnjoy the ride.‚Äù $CHONE‚Äôs young presence in a crypto market tipped to be highly favored under the incoming US government makes it a good investment consideration. Early investors will have the opportunity to ride the wave before it goes mainstream. The meme coin market thrives on stories (narratives), and Chill Drone has one of the best narratives in the market right now.

Economic Events Jan. 20 to 24 President-elect Donald Trump will be sworn into office on Monday, but markets may have already factored this in. However, the signing of executive orders may come quickly, inducing further market volatility. Over the weekend, Trump launched his own memecoin (TRUMP), which surged to over $70 billion in fully diluted valuation in a matter of hours before dumping 50% in a massive market crash.

On Saturday, Donald Trump‚Äôs official token, TRUMP, was issued on the Solana blockchain, which led to an uptick in trading volumes over the weekend. Between Saturday and Sunday, the network generated fees of over $35 million and revenue of at least $14 million, DeFiLlama data shows. This volume originated from some 6 million active addresses. These fees are more than double of Nov. 22 levels of nearly $14 million, when several AI Agent tokens populated the network and led to a trading frenzy. Such fees are remarkably high for a low-cost blockchain, when transactions typically take fractions of a cent to settle. The TRUMP token attracted over $3 billion in trading volumes on Saturday and Sunday, with other ecosystem plays, such as Jupiter‚Äôs JUP, seeing heightened interest from traders. The choice of Solana as an issuance network, in turn, bumped demand and sentiment for SOL tokens, as reported by CoinDesk . SOL trading volumes have rocketed from Thursday‚Äôs $3 billion to over $26 billion in the past 24 hours, with Saturday‚Äôs moves bringing weekly gains to over 46%. SOL has surged nearly 3,000% from its three-year low of $9 back in December 2022 when the implosion of crypto exchange FTX and prominent Solana backer Sam Bankman-Fried, dented sentiment for the network. Late Sunday, First Lady Melania Trump launched her own memecoin in a move that sent TRUMP spiraling down 50% at one point. The high volumes and network requests briefly caused ecosystem applications Jito and Phantom to encounter delays in Asian morning hours, though these were quickly rectified.

Authorities in Jeju Island, South Korea ‚Äòs largest island, have arrested six Chinese nationals for allegedly stealing 1 billion won (nearly $690,000) during Tether ( USDT ) transaction at a hotel on Jan. 16, Maeil Business Newspaper reports , citing Jeju Western Police. The group is accused of attacking the crypto dealer ‚Äî known just as A ‚Äî and taking the cash. The suspects, including a man in his 40s ‚Äî called B ‚Äî, say they‚Äôre the real victims. Police said the group accused A of ‚Äúmaking Tether stablecoins disappear‚Äù during the transaction. The authorities allege that the group attacked the A person and took the cash meant for the exchange. Two suspects were arrested at the hotel, the report reads, adding that three others were caught at Jeju International Airport, and one was arrested at another currency exchange. Police recovered 369 million won in cash from the suspects but are still tracking the rest.

They claim they originally planned to exchange Korean won for Chinese currency but were convinced to use virtual currency instead. Investigators believe the group always intended to use Tether and think they moved the stablecoins out of the wallet during the exchange before attacking A to steal the funds. Meanwhile, South Korea‚Äôs financial regulator, the Financial Services Commission, has officially started working on the second phase of its crypto rules to boost user protection. Kim So-young, Vice Chairman of the FSC, said the move to push ahead with phase two comes as the global crypto market faces ‚Äúrapid changes with mixed feelings of optimism and uncertainty.‚Äù The new set of rules will reportedly cover such areas as stablecoins , crypto exchanges, and business entry regulations, though detail are yet to be revealed.

Chart Pattern Suggests Yes,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/will-dogecoin-skyrocket-soon-chart-pattern-yes/,"A key technical development on the Dogecoin (DOGE/USD) chart could hint at a bullish move if current support levels hold, according to crypto market analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA). After roughly a month in a downward-sloping pattern, DOGE appears to be rebounding off the former resistance line of this channel‚Äîan event that often garners attention among traders looking for an upswing. Dogecoin Price Ready To Skyrocket? On Sunday (Jan 19), Kevin noted that Dogecoin had been ‚Äútrading in a falling channel for over a month‚Äù and was ‚Äúcurrently back testing‚Äù the channel‚Äôs upper boundary. He emphasized that it was crucial for DOGE ‚Äúto hold this and bounce,‚Äù noting that failure to do so might force a ‚Äúreassessment‚Äù of the chart. Thus far, it seems the cryptocurrency is managing to defend its newfound support. DOGE briefly dipped to about $0.345 before closing two deep wick four-hour candles back above the trend line. Kevin pointed out this ‚Äúnice bounce off the retest‚Äù and its alignment with key four-hour moving averages, suggesting the potential for higher prices. Related Reading: Dogecoin‚Äôs Bullish Push Gains Steam, A Retest To $0.4 Ahead At press time, Dogecoin sits around the $0.38‚Äì$0.39 level, showing resilience at its former resistance-turned-support. Kevin noted: ‚ÄúDogecoin is catching a nice bounce off the retest of the falling channel I have been tracking along with its key 4HR moving averages. Very nice.‚Äù Despite Dogecoin‚Äôs promising technical setup, Kevin stressed that altcoins remain heavily dependent on Bitcoin‚Äôs direction and market dominance. He referred to the ongoing crypto cycle, asserting that ‚Äúwe have never been in an altseason‚Äù so far in this bull run. According to Kevin, altcoins will not ‚Äúdurably outperform the King‚Äù unless BTC dominance falls below the 54.51% threshold and USDT dominance sinks beneath 3.7%. Related Reading: Dogecoin Leads The Pack As Dog-Themed Coins Rally ‚Äì ‚ÄúTrump Effect‚Äù Sparks Excitement He also observed that Bitcoin dominance was nearing 59%, effectively ‚Äúattacking the macro golden pocket‚Äù and potentially threatening altcoin performance. If BTC reestablishes its lead above these critical dominance levels, Kevin believes the short-term outlook for most altcoins‚ÄîDogecoin included‚Äîmay remain constrained, even if their individual charts look constructive. Another factor adding turbulence to the crypto market is the recent memecoin launch by incoming US President Donald Trump. Kevin lamented that, in his view, the crypto market had been ‚Äúthe healthiest‚Äù it had looked in four years‚Äîhighlighting how higher-quality utility coins were gaining traction and how investors seemed to be ‚Äúfleeing to quality left and right.‚Äù However, he claims that ‚Äúin just 36 hours,‚Äù those close to Trump released a memecoin that derailed this dynamic, sparking renewed meme coin speculation and pulling many solid projects down by double-digit percentages. Despite describing this frenzy as a ‚Äútemporary derailment,‚Äù Kevin believes the situation will eventually stabilize: ‚ÄúIt may take a few weeks, but I still think we‚Äôre in a very good spot.‚Äù For Dogecoin, the immediate signal to watch is whether it can continue holding above its retested channel line. A decisive bounce above the $0.40-$0.41 region could bolster the bullish case, especially if broader market conditions remain supportive. On the other hand, any surge in Bitcoin dominance‚Äîand the possible return of heightened meme coin mania‚Äîmay introduce fresh headwinds. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.38.

The flagship coin signaled the onset of a fresh parabolic rally fueled by rising demand from institutional investors, and soon nation-states. Following the sudden Bitcoin price surge after retesting the support level around $100k, more than $264 million was liquidated from the BTC‚Äôs leveraged market in the last 24 hours, with the majority involving long traders. The altcoin industry followed in similar volatility, thus resulting in $1.25 billion in forced liquidations, with over $911 million involving long traders. Rising Demand for Bitcoin by Whale Investors Bitcoin price has enjoyed robust support from institutional investors seeking to hedge against global inflation and significant uncertainty in macroeconomics. For instance, the US spot BTC ETFs have registered exponential growth in the net cash inflow since the yearly calendar flipped three weeks ago. According to the latest market data, the US spot BTC ETFs have registered a net cash inflow of over $1.5 billion year-to-date. As a result, the US spot BTC ETFs have registered a cumulative total net inflow of $38 billion and currently have a total net assets of $120.95 billion.

This marks a new all-time high (ATH) for the flagship cryptocurrency, eclipsing its previous record of $108,000 set in December 2024. According to CoinMarketCap data , Bitcoin‚Äôs price touched $109,036 at 6:55 a.m. UTC, only to retreat below $108,000 minutes later. As of now, Bitcoin is trading at $107,293, up 3% in the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency boasts a market capitalization of $2.14 trillion, reflecting a remarkable 25% surge over the last seven days. Its 24-hour trading volume has also skyrocketed by 120%, reaching an impressive $108 billion. This historic milestone comes as the global financial markets closely monitor Trump‚Äôs upcoming inauguration at 4:00 p.m. UTC. The event has proven to be a powerful catalyst for Bitcoin, which first breached the $100,000 mark in December 2024 following Trump‚Äôs electoral victory. Bitcoin Breaks Records Market analysts point to growing optimism within the crypto community as a key driver of Bitcoin‚Äôs meteoric rise. Trump‚Äôs administration has consistently signaled a favorable stance toward cryptocurrencies, with campaign promises including crypto deregulation and a potential strategic Bitcoin reserve . These plans have injected fresh confidence into the market, fueling an extended bull run since his victory in November 2024. The President-elect‚Äôs crypto-friendly rhetoric has also revived hopes of greater adoption and innovation in the sector. Investors appear to be pricing in the possibility of relaxed regulatory frameworks, which could pave the way for enhanced institutional participation and new use cases for Bitcoin. Crypto Community Bets Big Trump‚Äôs anticipated policies have sparked debate among crypto enthusiasts and skeptics alike. While proponents celebrate the prospect of Bitcoin becoming a strategic asset for the U.S. economy, others warn of potential volatility stemming from policy overhauls. Nevertheless, Bitcoin‚Äôs record-breaking performance underscores its resilience and growing appeal as a hedge against economic uncertainty. With the cryptocurrency‚Äôs market cap now exceeding $2 trillion, it remains at the forefront of the digital asset revolution. As Trump prepares to assume office, all eyes are on the administration‚Äôs next moves and their potential to shape the future of Bitcoin and the broader crypto market.

On the sidelines, established player Solana (SOL) has been making big moves the last week despite a slow start to the year. However, investors are increasingly looking for projects that offer something different, and many are setting their sights on Rollblock as a preferable option. Rollblock ($RBLK) offers an engaging iGaming environment while employing blockchain principles in its design to ensure fairness for players, while adding a twist to the usual casino setup. So how will Rollblock, Solana, and Shiba Inu perform in the next quarter? Solana Sees 39% Rise In A Week Solana (SOL) has been on a tear this week, rising by 39% over its duration. Solana is now trading at $261.63, having posted a 19.12% gain in the last 24 hours alone. So why is Solana seeing so much traction? It could have to do with the technological foundation Solana has built for itself throughout 2024. The year saw the introduction of the Firedancer validator client, which boosted the network‚Äôs transaction throughput drastically. Despite this, Solana (SOL) has faced some criticisms for a slew of network outages that plagued users on the platform throughout 2023 and 2024. Recent rises may be partially attributed to this issue being ironed out by the developers. Shiba Inu Loses 6% In 24 Hours Shiba Inu had several ups and downs throughout January. In particular, it saw wild fluctuations between the 2nd and 8th and again between the 15th and 17th, to reach a net monthly gain of 6%. But the last 24 hours have shattered Shiba Inu, as it fell by 6%. Shiba Inu developers have been busy trying to introduce more utility to Shiba Inu‚Äôs ecosystem as they attempt to lift it from its meme coin reputation. Rollblock Raises the Bar for GambleFi Rollblock ($RBLK) is redefining the $450 billion online gambling market with its innovative GambleFi platform. Combining blockchain transparency with an extensive iGaming ecosystem, Rollblock addresses the critical issues of trust and fairness that have plagued traditional casinos for the past decade. Built on Ethereum, Rollblock ensures every transaction and bet is immutable and tamper-proof. The platform features over 7,000 games, including live casino classics like baccarat and blackjack, as well as modern virtual experiences such as ‚ÄúMystic Safari‚Äù and ‚ÄúAstro Dash.‚Äù Its recently launched sportsbook has also gained traction, generating $1.75 million in wagers in December and driving a 600% increase in deposits and sign-ups. Rollblock‚Äôs tokenomics set it apart from its competitors. Up to 30% of weekly profits are allocated to repurchasing $RBLK tokens from the open market, with 60% burned to increase scarcity and 40% distributed as staking rewards to native token holders. Licensed by Anjouan Gaming, Rollblock operates as a fully verified and transparent casino. Collaborating with over 20 leading gaming providers, the platform ensures all games are provably fair, addressing a major pain point in the online gambling industry. Rollblock Closes In On $9 Million In Presale While Solana and Shiba Inu have proven their ability to generate returns, Rollblock ($RBLK) offers a unique and transformative approach to GambleFi that could redefine the market. Proactive investors can snap up $RBLK tokens for just $0.046 in stage 9 of its presale , which has nearly raised $9 million and continues to gather momentum. As analysts forecast an 880% rise during the presale and up to a 100x return post-launch, iGaming and DeFi enthusiasts alike will not want to miss out on Rollblock ($RBLK) in 2025.

It has attracted huge liquidity that has helped the token enter the top 20 cryptos in the market. Meanwhile, Bitcoin, which traded within a narrow range and was believed to head back below $100K, suddenly surged and formed a new ATH above $109K in no time. Hence, there is a huge possibility that the BTC price will break above $110K soon after the new president‚Äôs inauguration. Along with the new president, the SEC is expected to get a new chairman, Gary Gensler, who will take an exit from his position. With this, the market is anticipated to take a major shift towards less stringent regulations under Trump‚Äôs inauguration. This may further usher in a new era for digital assets, bolstering the growth across the board. With a potential Bitcoin reserve announcement, there has not been any major correction in the BTC price. The Bitcoin price is sitting at a new ATH, which suggests investor sentiment is moving around the long-term prospect instead of short-term profit-making. Presently, BTC has entered into the profit-taking stage but this could be just a start. The BTC price has entered the final resistance before entering the discovery phase, which is also the neckline of the ‚Äòw-shaped‚Äô or double bottom pattern. The supertrend has turned bullish, which suggests more upside potential is on the horizon. Besides, the RSI is heading towards the upper threshold and once these levels enter the overbought zone, Bitcoin is expected to mark a new ATH at around $115K. A minor retracement to the resistance-turned-support zone between $107.9 and $109.3 is possible but it could be for a short time frame. However, the ongoing TRUMP & MELANIA mania is assumed to be the reason for the volatility within the markets. Therefore, a major change is expected in the next few days, but the sustainability of the rally above the gains remains unclear.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|REGULATION|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-20 07:56:02

The Mystery Behind the Mega Purchase appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News While the White House is making its last-minute arrangements to welcome Donald Trump, ventures and persons linked to the Trump family have made some sensational moves in the cryptocurrency market. The latest is the massive Ethereum purchase done by World Liberty Financial. Interesting, hinting at more exciting developments, Eric Trump states: ‚ÄúWait until you see what they do tomorrow.‚Äù Definitely, the Trump family‚Äôs engagements have created extreme excitement in the market. The element of curiosity has been lifted to its peak. What‚Äôs next? Let‚Äôs examine the scenario a bit deeper. Ready? Dive in! Trump‚Äôs WLF‚Äôs $48 Million Ethereum Purchase On January 19, World Liberty Financial, a DeFi venture linked to US President-elect Donald Trump, acquired as much as 14,403 ETH at an average price per coin of $3,300. This indicates that the DeFi project invested at least $48 million to materise the deal. Data shows that, with the recent purchase, the total ETH holdings of WLF has surged to around 28,612 ETH. Considering that, at the time of writing, the price of Ethereum stands at $3,357, the value of the total ETH holdings of WLT is at least $96,050,484.

Back in late 2020, the SEC sued Ripple Labs, alleging that XRP was being sold as an unregistered security. This lawsuit has been dragging on for nearly four years, and many in the crypto community are now wondering if it‚Äôs about to come to an end. The SEC has recently doubled down on its appeal, arguing that the court erred in deciding that XRP sales were not securities. However, some legal experts, including former SEC lawyer Marc Fagel, believe that the case could continue for another 10 months, or possibly be dropped if new SEC leadership decides not to pursue it. With Gary Gensler‚Äôs exit from the SEC, there is a growing possibility that the new leadership may go ahead with what Fagel said. Ripple‚Äôs legal team remains confident that the SEC‚Äôs arguments are weak and that the appeal could be dismissed. If Ripple wins, it could have far-reaching effects on the crypto market. A ruling in Ripple‚Äôs favor would set a precedent for other cryptocurrencies, potentially shielding them from SEC scrutiny. On the other hand, if the SEC wins, it could create broader regulatory challenges for tokens that rely on community-driven hype or marketing, as they might be classified as securities. XRP Rally Continues: XRP has just reached its highest price since 2018, surpassing $3.Several factors could push XRP to higher levels. A favorable outcome in the SEC lawsuit would act as a major catalyst for growth. Additionally, the broader adoption of Ripple‚Äôs technology in cross-border payments could drive more demand for XRP.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP|ALTCOIN|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-20 08:14:41
