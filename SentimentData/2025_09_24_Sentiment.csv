SEC Chair Paul Atkins Says He Has His “Hands Full” According to the September 23 X post published on the official Mornings with Maria account, Atkins pushed back on the idea that the two agencies would merge, saying that he has his “hands full right now.” SEC chairman wants ordinary Americans in private markets: ‘Make IPOs great again’ pic.twitter.com/m2KiX1vSrM — Mornings with Maria (@MorningsMaria) September 23, 2025 “We’re working hand in glove with the CFTC right now, so compartmentalization is what I really envision,” Atkins said. “People have been discussing these issues for a long time, and we’re at a point now, especially when we look at the changes in the digital asset area, that it’s really incumbent on the two agencies to work hand in glove.” However, Atkins did admit that the SEC has been looking at “issues with respect to the crypto area,” alongside the CFTC, with the former SEC commissioner affirming that the “American public will benefit from a joint effort by the two agencies.” CFTC, SEC Prepare for Highly-Anticipated Roundtable News of the CFTC and SEC’s rumored merger comes ahead of the agencies’ joint roundtable next Monday, September 29. According to the SEC’s website , the roundtable will serve as “an opportunity to discuss regulatory harmonization priorities” and will be open to the public. “It is a new day at the SEC and the CFTC, and today we begin a long-awaited journey to provide markets the clarity they deserve,” Atkins and CFTC Acting Chairman Caroline D. Pham said in a September 5 statement. “By working in lockstep, our two agencies can harness our nation’s unique regulatory structure into a source of strength for market participants, investors, and all Americans,” they added. However, exactly how the two agencies will address potential overlapping blockchain jurisdictions remains to be determined.

Just last month, Bitcoin hit a new record high of $124,128. It has since pulled back 9%. However, the Fed’s recent interest rate cuts, along with a flurry of spot altcoin ETF application verdicts due next month, could light the spark on a 2025/2026 bull run. Regulators are also stepping up their pace. In July, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act, the first sweeping U.S. federal law targeting stablecoins, which requires issuers to maintain full reserve backing. Shortly after, the SEC unveiled Project Crypto, designed to modernize securities law and create clearer rules for companies working in the digital asset space. All things considered, the next rally in altcoins will surpass the gold rush of 2021, guided by clearer regulations. If Claude AI’s forecast proves accurate, XRP, Dogecoin, and Pi Network will lead the charge. XRP (Ripple): Claude AI Predicts a Surge of 700%+ Toward $24 According to Claude AI, Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could climb as high as $24 by the end of 2025, a potential gain of more than 739% from its current level around $2.86. XRP has already demonstrated notable strength this cycle. On July 18, it touched $3.65, eclipsing its 2018 peak of $3.40, before retreating by about 21.5% amid broader macroeconomic pressures. Ripple’s global payments ecosystem continues to expand, gaining recognition from major organizations. In 2024, the UN Capital Development Fund endorsed XRP as a low-cost remittance option for developing economies. The resolution of Ripple’s lengthy legal standoff with the SEC in early 2025 cleared one of the biggest overhangs for the token. The regulator officially dropped its lawsuit following a 2023 ruling that retail XRP sales do not meet the definition of securities. Claude AI suggests that if XRP retests and holds its July highs, a move toward $4 to $5 is achievable, with a strong bull case scenario highlighting a run up to anywhere between $7 and $24. The appearance of three bullish flags across XRP’s support and resistance lines over the last year sets up the potential for a rapid breakout in the final quarter. Despite recent Fed rate cuts and the approval of the first spot XRP ETF , markets remain cautious, likely awaiting the SEC’s upcoming decisions on additional ETF applications expected next month, alongside the rollout of comprehensive crypto legislation. Over the past year, XRP has surged 389%, quintupling Bitcoin’s 78% gains, and 7x growth compared with Ethereum’s 58.5% price appreciation over the same period. Dogecoin ($DOGE): Claude AI Expects a Push Beyond $1 for the Meme Coin Pioneer Dogecoin ($DOGE) , which began in 2013 as a joke currency, has grown into a top-10 crypto with a market cap of about $36.3 billion, making up nearly half of the $78.1 billion meme coin sector. Its longevity comes from a passionate community and a steadily increasing role in payments. While DOGE often mirrors Bitcoin’s price movements, its strong liquidity and grassroots following have allowed it to survive multiple downturns. Now priced around $0.2386, Dogecoin has more than doubled in the past year, outperforming Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Shiba Inu, and Pepe. Chart analysts point to repeating bullish falling wedge patterns seen from November through April, and again in mid-summer, suggesting the potential for further major upside pending good industry developments. Dogecoin is likely to face some resistance on the way up at the $0.45 band. However, should it slip, it will have firm support at $0.30. Claude AI’s base case sees DOGE reaching $0.33 by December, with the higher-end target of $1.50 representing a massive 530% rally from current prices. That would also fulfill the “Doge Army’s” long-standing dream of $1 per coin, a psychological milestone that eluded the project during its 2021 all-time high of $0.7316. Real-world adoption is also increasing: Tesla accepts DOGE for merchandise purchases, while platforms like PayPal and Revolut have integrated Dogecoin into their payment ecosystems. Pi Network ($PI): Claude AI Projects Explosive Growth for Tap-to-Mine Coin Pi Network ($PI) has attracted attention with its mobile “tap-to-mine” system, allowing users to earn tokens simply by opening the app and tapping once a day. Currently trading near $0.2731 Claude AI forecasts a potentially aggressive scenario where the token could rise to $50 by year’s end, an astonishing 180× increase. While that outcome may be overly optimistic under current market conditions, the project’s roadmap provides some justification for bullish sentiment. The development team is steadily advancing, with version 23 and a possible mainnet launch expected soon, events that could add fresh momentum. Since debuting in February 2025, Pi Network has shown extreme volatility, including a 171% surge in May. Its RSI now sits at 26, which means it is greatly undervalued right now, so investors that believe in its premise can see this as a prime dip-buying opportunity. Most analysts, however, remain more cautious, seeing a return to February’s $2.99 peak as a strong but unrealistic goal. Even if the ultra-bullish case does not play out, October has historically been a favorable month for crypto, leaving room for doubling, in accordance with Claude’s base case optimistic scenario, or potentially up to $5. Maxi Doge (MAXI): A High-Risk Meme Coin Play For investors seeking more speculative bets outside Claude AI’s primary picks, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) markets itself as the “degenerate cousin” of Dogecoin, embracing volatility and meme culture as part of its brand identity. While Dogecoin has matured into a mainstream digital asset, Maxi Doge is leaning into its risk-on appeal. The presale has already raised over $2.4 million in just its first month. Launched as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, MAXI is focused on viral growth through Telegram and Discord engagement, trading competitions, and partnerships with other projects. Of the 150.24 billion tokens minted, roughly 25% are allocated to the “Maxi Fund,” designed to fund marketing and collaborations. Staking is currently live with yields of 136% APY, though these rates are expected to decline as more users stake. The presale price is currently $0.0002585, with the nominal price hikes scheduled as the presale moves through its funding rounds. Investors can participate through the official Maxi Doge website using MetaMask or Best Wallet . Stay updated through Maxi Doge’s official X and Telegram pages.

52166475,https://cryptonews.com/?p=427060,1758666600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/52166475.jpeg,"Best Crypto to Buy 23 September – XRP, Shiba Inu, Pepe",https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-23-september-xrp-shiba-inu-pepe/,"With countless cryptocurrencies to choose from in a burgeoning $4 trillion market, determining which one offers the best crypto buying opportunity right now can be overwhelming Bitcoin sailed to a new record high of $124,128 just last month. Additionally, the space is diversifying, and enthusiasm remains strong for major altcoins and the best meme coins . Over the past year, numerous tokens have reached fresh highs, reflecting rising optimism within the crypto market. Much of this renewed momentum can be linked to two major policy shifts in Washington. First, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act, the first sweeping U.S. regulation focused on stablecoins. Second, the SEC unveiled Project Crypto, an initiative to update and clarify how securities laws apply to digital assets. As sentiment improves, it’s worth examining how key altcoins such as XRP, Shiba Inu, and Pepe are today’s best dip buying opportunities to prepare for the next bull run. Ripple ($XRP): Cross-Border Payments Leader and Blue-Chip Crypto for 2025 Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) climbed to an all-time high (ATH) of $3.65 on July 18, the same day the GENIUS Act became law, surpassing its 2018 peak of $3.40. Since then, it has eased back to around $2.86, about 21.5% off its recent historic peak. The token’s competitive edge comes from enabling low-cost, fast cross-border payments, offering a modern alternative to traditional networks such as SWIFT. This role has been reinforced by support from groups like the UN Capital Development Fund and even acknowledgment from the White House. Ripple’s influence in the policy arena was also evident when CEO Brad Garlinghouse joined a high-profile White House roundtable on crypto regulation earlier this year. With the launch of the dollar-pegged RLUSD, Ripple has also positioned itself to take significant market share from the stablecoin sector. Momentum accelerated in 2023 after a U.S. court ruled XRP’s retail sales were not securities, effectively ending a five-year clash with the SEC and delivering a milestone win for the broader industry. In the past 12 months, XRP has soared 389%, quintupling Bitcoin’s 78% gains. Following July’s rally, the token found strong support at $3, although with the arrival of September, a month where crypto typically underperforms, it has slipped beneath that threshold. Currently, XRP’s relative strength index (RSI) sits near 42 and may be reversing its course. The Fed’s recent rate cuts and the greenlighting of the first spot XRP ETF failed to unleash a full-scale XRP rall,y but many argue that it was expected and already priced in beforehand. Looking forward, the SEC is expected to rule on additional spot XRP ETFs in mid-October, a decision that could lift the token above $4 within weeks. Shiba Inu ($SHIB): Meme Coin Powerhouse Expanding Into Utility Debuting in August 2020, Shiba Inu ($SHIB) has grown into the second-largest meme coin, boasting a market cap of over $7.2 billion. In the last 24 hours, SHIB’s value rose 1%, outperforming the broader $78.1 billion meme coin sector, which crashed 7%. Considering that the overall $4 trillion crypto market also rose 1% overnight, SHIB’s relatively stable price action, alongside its large market cap and expanding use cases, makes it trade more like a blue-chip crypto than a typical meme coin. It currently sits around $0.0000122. Chart analysis suggests further potential upside. Over the last year, SHIB has developed two bullish formations: a descending wedge between November and March and a flag pattern since May. Breaking through resistance at $0.000022 could pave the way toward $0.00003 by late October. In a stronger bull market, projections range from $0.00006 to $0.00009 by year’s end. Unlike most meme coins, SHIB has tangible applications. These include Shibarium, an Ethereum-based Layer-2 designed to lower fees and speed up transactions, along with privacy-focused tools that broaden its utility. Pepe ($PEPE): Meme Icon With Breakout Potential Launched in April 2023, Pepe ($PEPE) quickly became one of the top meme coins by market cap, driven by the cultural appeal of Matt Furie’s iconic frog character in his webcomic Boy’s Club . Its explosive growth led to many imitators, though none matched its success. With a market cap above $4 billion, Pepe has attracted attention the world over, even briefly cameoing as Elon Musk’s X profile picture. Currently priced near $0.000009689, PEPE’s price remains virtually unchanged in the last 24 hours, highlighting its resilience. However, it’s still 65% below its all-time high of $0.00002803 set in late 2024. However, crypto markets typically strengthen in October, and should “Uptober” materialize, meme coin fervour could mean Pepe is challenging its former high by November. With its RSI at about 40 and downtrending, PEPE is in the midst of a sell-off that could further discount prices during the working week, providing a small window of a dip buying opportunity. Supporters argue that improving macro conditions and growing investor confidence could help propel PEPE to new highs this summer. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): A Cutting-Edge Bitcoin Layer 2 Presale for 2025 Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is quickly becoming one of the standout presales of 2025, aiming to introduce the first Bitcoin Layer 2 that combines viral meme appeal with scalability and decentralized governance. The project’s goal is to expand Bitcoin’s utility by enabling faster payments, smart contracts, and community-led decision-making. The presale has already raised approximately $17.7 million, with some analysts predicting gains of 10× or more after launch. Powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER offers high-speed smart contracts with minimal transaction costs. One of its key features is the Canonical Bridge, which enables near-instant Bitcoin transfers on its Layer 2 while supporting dApps, meme tokens, and payment processing at very low fees. A recent Coinsult audit reported no vulnerabilities, strengthening investor confidence. The $HYPER token serves multiple functions within the ecosystem, from staking and transaction fees to governance rights. Early presale buyers can earn staking rewards of up to 66% APY, along with voting rights once the platform is live.

Some tokens have rebounded strongly in the past 24 hours, with yesterday’s Metaplanet purchase of 5,419 BTC being the major driver of renewed optimism. It’s in this context that the immediate prospects for XRP, Solana and Cardano have improved, with all three coins likely to rally as the week progresses. We also consider where they might be heading towards the end of the year, which could bring a bull rally if the SEC approves most outstanding ETF applications. Crypto Price Prediction: XRP ($XRP) – Oversold Technicals and Incoming ETFs Could Mean New ATH in Q4 XRP has bounced by 2% in the past 24 hours, recovering from its 24-hour low of $2.80 to return to $2.87. However, this current level still means that the altcoin has dropped by 4% in a week and by 5% in a month, making for a disappointing August and September for the market’s fourth-biggest token. Yet as the chart below illustrates, XRP’s recent underperformance (which follows the wider market’s underperformance) has put it in an oversold position, meaning that it should bounce back very soon. For instance, its relative strength index (yellow) dropped below 50 a few days ago, having spent much of August and September in a weak position. Source: TradingView And with the same thing applying to XRP’s MACD (orange, blue), it’s likely that the altcoin will make a concerted recovery soon. Its fundamentals also point in this direction, in that the SEC could approve upwards of ten XRP ETFs in the next few weeks. The approval of most or even a few such ETFs could result in a big influx of institutional money, pushing the XRP price upwards as we approach the festive season. This is why the crypto price prediction for XRP is so bullish right now, and when you add Ripple’s ongoing growth as a cross-border payments firm, we could see the coin hit $5 by December. Crypto Price Prediction: Solana ($SOL) – Institutional Investment Will Enable SOL to Explode Soon At $220, Solana is down by 1% in a day and by 6.5% in a week, although it has posted a 6% gain in the last 30 days. It’s also up by 50% in the past year, a percentage which marks steady if unspectacular annual growth. Yet if Solana’s annual growth hasn’t been spectacular, then the picture could very easily change over the next few weeks. Forward Industries Raises $1.65B for Solana Treasury Strategy Backed by Galaxy, Jump, Multicoin Forward Industries has announced a $1.65 billion private placement in cash and stablecoin commitments through a private investment in public equity (PIPE) round led by Galaxy… — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 12, 2025 As with XRP, this is because SOL is also waiting on the SEC to approve several spot-based Solana ETFs, which again could boost the coin’s market massively. At the same time, Solana has been enjoying some very positive developments and news in recent weeks, including the growth in public companies accumulating the coin as a reserve asset. For instance, the Galaxy Digital-backed Forward Industries has been buying $1.65 billion in SOL, making it the largest publicly listed holder of the token. Source: TradingView Such pieces of news mean that Solana has been faring better than other major tokens this month, yet it’s still far from reaching its full potential or being overbought. Because of this, we could expect the coin to reach $250 by the middle of October, $350 by the end of November, and then $500 by the end of the year. Crypto Price Prediction: Cardano ($ADA) – L1 Growth and Whale Transfers Point to Big Moves Cardano has posted a modest rise to $0.8257 today, although it does remain down by 4.5% in a week and by 9% in a month. On the other hand, it still boasts a decent 130% increase in a year, underlining its potential as an under-appreciated altcoin. In fact, ADA remains down by 73% in relation to its ATH of $3.09, which it set way back in September 2021. This means that it’s way overdue a big rally, and given Cardano’s fundamentals as a major layer-one blockchain, such a rally is likely to come sooner or later. We can see below that its RSI has been struggling to break into higher readings for several weeks now, increasing the odds of such a move. Source: TradingView We have also seen some massive transfers involving unknown whale wallets in the past couple of days, heightening the sense that something major is about to happen for ADA. And given that Cardano is a top-20 blockchain in terms of TVL , and that it continues to grow steadily , we could see big moves towards. There’s also the fact that ADA is also waiting on one ETF application, so its crypto price prediction could also turn hyper-bullish soon. We could see it reach $1 in early October , before closing the year at around $2.50 . Mine-to-Earn Coin PEPENODE Raises $1.3 Million in Presale: Next Big Play? The three coins above are all in great positions to climb vigorously in the final quarter of the year, yet they won’t be the only tokens to post strong returns as we approach 2026. Indeed, traders should also consider diversifying into one of the numerous presale coins that are currently available, with some of these showing the potential to rally hard once they list. One of the best examples of this is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), an ERC-20 token that has now raised just over $1.3 million in its ongoing sale. The PEPENODE presale is live. Buy Nodes. Build Your Server Room. Combine Nodes For Huge Bonuses. Do it all here https://t.co/d1JAronqiv pic.twitter.com/60uLhEoukP — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) September 10, 2025 What makes PEPENODE special is that it’s the market’s first-ever mine-to-earn token, providing holders with the ability to build their own virtual mining rigs and earn mining rewards. By spending PEPENODE on acquiring virtual nodes, users can increase their mining rewards, which will include other meme tokens, such as Fartcoin and PEPE. This comes on top of staking rewards paid out in PEPENODE itself, giving investors lots of incentive to acquire more of the coin. As such, the token could experience huge demand once it lists in the next few weeks, giving it the opportunity to become one of the next big meme coins. Investors can join the sale and buy it early on the PEPENODE website . Just connect a compatible wallet (such as Best Wallet ) and make the payment using crypto or a credit/debit card. It’s currently selling at $0.0010702, although investors should move quickly, since this price will continue to rise throughout the sale.

For those tracking the digital frontier, including the dynamic cryptocurrency space, the foundational infrastructure supporting these advancements is just as crucial as the breakthroughs themselves. Imagine the sheer computational muscle required to power the next generation of AI models, the kind that could redefine industries and even human interaction. This is precisely what OpenAI is gearing up for, embarking on an ambitious journey to construct a network of colossal AI data centers known as Project Stargate. This massive undertaking, backed by industry giants Oracle and SoftBank, signals a new era in AI development, promising to reshape the technological landscape as we know it. What is Project Stargate and Why Does it Matter? Project Stargate is not just another data center initiative; it’s a vision for a supercomputing backbone designed to meet the insatiable demands of advanced AI. At its core, Stargate represents OpenAI ‘s commitment to pushing the boundaries of artificial general intelligence (AGI). The sheer scale of this project is astounding, with a planned capacity of seven gigawatts. To put that into perspective, seven gigawatts is enough energy to power more than five million homes. This monumental energy requirement underscores the immense computational needs of training and deploying increasingly complex AI models, from large language models to advanced generative AI. For anyone invested in the future of technology, understanding the infrastructure behind AI breakthroughs is key. Stargate isn’t just about housing servers; it’s about creating an ecosystem where AI can truly flourish, enabling faster training times, more sophisticated algorithms, and ultimately, more powerful and versatile AI applications. The implications of such a project are far-reaching: Accelerated AI Development: With vastly increased computational power, OpenAI can iterate on models more rapidly, leading to quicker advancements. New Capabilities: More powerful infrastructure enables the development of AI models with capabilities previously deemed impossible. Economic Impact: The construction and operation of these facilities will create jobs, stimulate local economies, and attract further investment in tech hubs. Global Competitiveness: Such infrastructure solidifies the position of the United States as a leader in AI innovation. The Power Players: Oracle , SoftBank , and OpenAI ‘s Strategic Alliance The success of an undertaking as grand as Project Stargate hinges on strategic partnerships. OpenAI has meticulously chosen its collaborators, tapping into the strengths of two industry titans: Oracle and SoftBank . These alliances are not merely financial; they represent a confluence of technological expertise, global reach, and a shared vision for the future of AI. Oracle ‘s Cloud Computing Prowess Oracle , a long-standing giant in enterprise software and cloud infrastructure, brings its robust cloud computing capabilities and expertise in building and managing large-scale data centers. Three of the five new Stargate sites are being developed in collaboration with Oracle, leveraging their Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) platform. OCI is known for its high performance, scalability, and security, making it an ideal foundation for demanding AI workloads. Oracle’s commitment to supporting cutting-edge AI initiatives aligns perfectly with OpenAI ‘s goals, providing the necessary hardware, network, and operational excellence to handle the unprecedented data flows and processing power required. This partnership signifies Oracle’s aggressive push into the AI infrastructure market, positioning them as a critical enabler for the next wave of AI innovation. SoftBank ‘s Visionary Investment and Global Reach SoftBank , the Japanese multinational conglomerate known for its extensive investments in technology and telecommunications, is partnering with OpenAI on the remaining two Stargate sites. SoftBank’s involvement is strategic, providing not only significant capital but also its vast network and experience in large-scale infrastructure projects. SoftBank’s vision often involves identifying and nurturing disruptive technologies, and its investment in Stargate underscores the firm’s belief in the transformative power of AI. Their global perspective and ability to mobilize resources across diverse sectors will be invaluable in navigating the complexities of such a massive buildout. This collaboration highlights a shared understanding that foundational infrastructure is paramount for unlocking AI’s full potential. The synergy between these three entities is undeniable: OpenAI: The AI innovator, driving the demand for advanced compute. Oracle: The infrastructure provider, offering scalable and high-performance cloud solutions. SoftBank: The strategic investor and enabler, providing capital and global project expertise. Unpacking the Scale: The Immense Need for AI Data Centers The rapid evolution of AI models, particularly large language models (LLMs) and generative AI, has created an insatiable demand for computational resources. Training these models requires vast amounts of data and billions of parameters, necessitating an unprecedented scale of hardware and energy. This is where the concept of ‘gigawatt-scale’ AI data centers becomes critical. The existing infrastructure, while powerful, simply isn’t sufficient to handle the future needs of AI development. Consider these factors driving the demand: Model Complexity: AI models are growing exponentially in size and complexity, requiring more processing power and memory. Data Volume: Training data sets are enormous, demanding massive storage and high-speed data transfer capabilities. Inference at Scale: Once trained, these models need to serve millions of users, requiring efficient and powerful inference capabilities. Continuous Innovation: The pace of AI research means constant experimentation and retraining, which consumes vast resources. The $100 billion investment from Nvidia, mentioned in the original report, further illustrates this point. This capital is earmarked specifically for acquiring Nvidia’s cutting-edge AI processors – the very chips that power these advanced models – and building out even more AI data centers. It’s a clear signal that the race for AI dominance is fundamentally a race for computational infrastructure. Companies like OpenAI understand that without robust, scalable, and energy-efficient data centers, the theoretical advancements in AI cannot translate into practical, impactful applications. Geographic Footprint: Where are OpenAI ‘s New Hubs Located? The strategic placement of these new AI data centers is crucial for operational efficiency, energy access, and disaster recovery. OpenAI ‘s expansion includes five new sites across the United States, carefully selected for their potential to support such large-scale operations. Here’s a breakdown of the announced locations: Partner Location Notes Oracle Shackelford County, Texas Leveraging Texas’s energy resources and growing tech infrastructure. Oracle Doña Ana County, New Mexico Strategic location in the Southwest, potentially benefiting from renewable energy initiatives. Oracle Undisclosed location in the Midwest Likely chosen for access to power grids and potentially cooler climates for efficient cooling. SoftBank Lordstown, Ohio Utilizing existing industrial sites and energy infrastructure in the region. SoftBank Milam County, Texas Another significant presence in Texas, highlighting its strategic importance for data center development. These locations are not chosen at random. Factors such as access to reliable and affordable power, fiber optic networks, skilled labor, and favorable regulatory environments play a significant role. Texas, for instance, has become a hotbed for data center development due to its energy grid and pro-business environment. The expansion into the Midwest and Southwest also suggests a strategy of geographical diversification, reducing risks associated with localized natural disasters or energy disruptions. This distributed approach ensures redundancy and resilience, critical for maintaining continuous AI operations. Fueling the Future: The Economic and Technological Impact of Stargate The construction of these new Stargate data centers is more than just an infrastructure project; it’s an investment in the future of technology itself. The economic impact will be substantial, from the creation of thousands of construction and operational jobs to stimulating local economies in the chosen regions. Beyond direct economic benefits, the technological implications are profound. For the broader tech ecosystem, including areas like blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi), the advancements enabled by Stargate could lead to: More Sophisticated AI Tools: Enhanced AI capabilities could improve fraud detection, predictive analytics, and algorithmic trading in financial markets. Improved Security: AI can play a critical role in cybersecurity, protecting digital assets and infrastructure. Innovation in Web3: Advanced AI could power more intelligent smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and user experiences in the Web3 space. Energy Considerations: The immense power consumption of these centers also brings a focus on sustainable energy solutions, a conversation relevant to all high-energy-consumption industries, including cryptocurrency mining. The challenges are also significant. The sheer energy demand of seven gigawatts raises environmental concerns, pushing for innovations in renewable energy sources and energy efficiency. Cooling these massive facilities efficiently will be another engineering feat. However, the benefits of accelerating AI development are seen as outweighing these challenges, driving further investment in green tech and sustainable practices within the data center industry. Conclusion: A New Dawn for AI Infrastructure OpenAI ‘s Stargate project, backed by the formidable resources of Oracle and SoftBank , marks a pivotal moment in the history of artificial intelligence. By committing to build five new gigawatt-scale AI data centers , OpenAI is not just expanding its capacity; it is laying the groundwork for the next generation of AI innovation. This monumental undertaking will provide the computational horsepower necessary to train and deploy models that could redefine industries, from healthcare and finance to education and entertainment. While challenges like energy consumption and environmental impact remain, the strategic partnerships and massive investment underscore a collective belief in the transformative power of AI. As these Stargate hubs come online, they will not only solidify OpenAI ‘s leadership but also accelerate the entire AI ecosystem, promising a future where intelligent machines play an even more integrated and sophisticated role in our lives.

The former CEO of the exchange took to his X account to protest the reports that have made the rounds since earlier today. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) has pushed back against a recent Financial Times report about YZi Labs, a crypto investment firm linked to his fortune. CZ described the report as “complete false news” and stated that it was filled with “fake, wrong, or made-up info.” In a series of posts on X, CZ said that the publication misrepresented YZi’s operations, his role, and even his past regulatory case, while promoting what he called “negative narratives.” CZ pushes back on “false narratives” The FT article portrayed YZi Labs , which was founded in January 2025 and led by former Binance executive Ella Zhang, as one of the world’s largest crypto investors managing Zhao’s wealth. It also reported that the fund is exploring ways to raise funds from outside investors. Zhao, however, denied nearly every element of that framing. In his posts, CZ accused FT of publishing inaccuracies without his participation. “Complete false news from FT, with fake/wrong/made-up info and negative narratives. This is just from what I gathered on social media, I did not even read the FT article. No subscription,” he wrote . CZ then went ahead to list a series of clarifications about YZi Labs. He clarified that the company is not raising external fundraising, does not have a demo or a pitch deck and that there has never been a plan for one. Clearing up rumors In his post, CZ made it clear that YZiLabs, since rebranding, has not sought a single external investor. “No requests, no discussions,” he wrote. He also denied being in communication with the former SEC Commissioner, Paul Atkins, who is now the Chair of the Commission, despite FT reporting otherwise. “I do respect Chairman Atkins tremendously, just from all the public info I see,” CZ added, but maintained there had been no engagement. Zhao also stressed that YZi Labs was not “spun out of Binance,” as reported. He stated that the company is operating independently, disputing the idea that it functions as an extension of his former exchange. The Binance founder also defended his past brush with the U.S. legal system, which was mentioned in the report. “I plead to a single violation of BSA, failure to maintain an adequate ANTI-money laundering program. Contrary to what FT characterized as ‘money laundering’ violations,” he wrote. “Failure to police is not the same as stealing. Two very different things that the traditional media keeps on intentionally mixing up.” CZ mentioned in his post that he had been invited by FT for a lunch interview with assurances of “positive coverage,” but declined at the last minute. “It was a trap! Cancelling that lunch now,” he wrote, before signing off with the remark: “Ethics… 4.” Your crypto news deserves attention - KEY Difference Wire puts you on 250+ top sites",News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|BNB|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-23 22:38:44

The incident involved hackers who took advantage of a vulnerability in the project’s multi-signature wallet that let them gain admin rights. Details of the Breach Blockchain security firm CyversAlerts alerted the community to the breach via an X post, noting that it had detected $11.3 million in suspicious transactions involving the web3 social project. Their analysis reveals that the hacker used an Ethereum address to carry out a “delegateCall,” stripped away the admin role, and installed a new owner with special permissions. They proceeded to move the funds, including $4 million in USDT, $500,000 in USDC, 3.7 WBTC, and 25 ETH. The stolen USDT and USDC were then converted to DAI on Ethereum, while USDT on Arbitrum was swapped to ETH and bridged back to the former. Not long after, a second address linked to the attack received 10 million UXLINK tokens worth around $3 million, with some already being traded. UXLINK later confirmed the incident on X, stating, “We have identified a security breach involving our multi-signature wallet, resulting in a significant amount of cryptocurrency being illicitly transferred to both CEXs and DEXs.” The company said it was working with internal and external security experts to identify the cause of the hack and contain the damage. It added that major platforms had been contacted to freeze suspicious UXLINK deposits, with coordination underway to stop further fund transfers. The case has also been forwarded to law enforcement and other authorities to speed up legal action and recovery efforts. UXLINK Plunges by Over 70% Despite intervention from exchanges such as Upbit, the exploit has severely impacted the token’s supply. In an update, the crypto project disclosed that the hacker had started minting UXLINK tokens. PeckShieldAlert noted that between 1 and 2 billion were created on Arbitrum, nearly doubling the token’s circulating supply. Roughly 490 million of these were dumped across DEXs and CEXs, causing a sharp sell-off. UXLINK’s price dropped by more than 70%, sliding from $0.30 to roughly $0.09, and wiping out around $70 million in market capitalization. Although Upbit reportedly froze $5–7 million worth of assets, most of the stolen funds, converted into 6,732 ETH valued at $28.1 million, remain under the attacker’s control. In an interesting twist, the exploiters also later fell victim to a scam by the Inferno Drainer group, losing over 542 million stolen tokens. UXLINK has since announced plans for a token swap to restore supply integrity and compensate affected holders. Further instructions will be issued through its official accounts.

As recent reports highlighted on Tuesday, this ambitious financial maneuver could position Tether alongside some of the most prominent private enterprises, including OpenAI, which was valued at $300 billion during its recent fundraising round. Tether Explores Fundraising Options The transaction would reportedly involve offering new equity rather than existing shareholders selling their stakes. Sources familiar with the situation told Bloomberg that discussions are still in the preliminary stages, meaning the specifics of the deal, including the total amount raised, could evolve over time.

On Monday, her firm Ark Investment Management bought Alibaba shares through two of its ETFs. The total value? About $16.3 million, according to Ark’s daily trading report. This isn’t some small blip. On Tuesday, Alibaba’s U.S.-traded ADRs hit levels not seen since November 2021. The stock has nearly doubled in 2025 alone. Traders are betting hard on its new AI strategy to turn things around, as its main e-commerce business keeps losing ground to rising players like PDD Holdings. Pinduoduo and Temu have been ripping into Alibaba’s market share. Ark ramps up China tech positions again Cathie first jumped into Alibaba in 2014, right after the company’s IPO. SEC records show steady involvement, until everything stopped cold in September 2021. That’s when Beijing’s regulatory crackdown hit Chinese internet firms hard. After that, there was no trace of Ark voting or trading activity tied to Alibaba. The silence lasted four years. But Monday’s buy looks like a full re-entry. It’s also not isolated. Ark also bought more shares of Baidu on the same day, pushing that position up to $47 million, according to the filings. That move follows earlier 2025 purchases in Baidu, making it clear Ark’s betting again on China’s tech sector. Ark still holds smaller stakes in other China-related names: BYD , Pony AI, and JD Logistics. Those are there, but tiny compared to Alibaba and Baidu. Cathie’s been famous for going after future tech bets. Her main fund, ARKK, is up 49% this year, beating both the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500. But zoom out, and it’s still down over the last five years. And while 2025 has been hot, the fund’s bled out $438 million in investor cash so far this year, based on Bloomberg data. This latest Alibaba move could be Cathie trying to pivot back into sectors she’d avoided since China’s tech meltdown. It also ties into her wider strategy of stacking up AI-focused bets, just as Wall Street’s obsession with artificial intelligence reaches fever pitch. And with Alibaba shifting its focus away from just e-commerce and deeper into machine learning, it fits her pattern. “AI is the next big wave of innovation,” Cathie’s team wrote in a recent update. “Companies leading in this space could see exponential growth.” She’s not alone in that thinking, but her timing is bold. Everyone’s watching to see if this $16.3 million buy-in is the start of a full comeback for Ark’s China exposure—or just a trade. Either way, Alibaba is back in her portfolio.

The meme coin has slipped 11% since the weekend amid a market-wide liquidation event, but the broader narrative continues to support optimism into Q4. Cooling September inflation has strengthened the case for continued rate cuts, though today’s Fed meeting will be pivotal in setting the tone. With markets pricing in another 0.50% of easing before year-end , there is a strong backbone for an explosive run, stimulating demand for risk assets like DOGE. At the same time, Dogecoin is deepening its foothold in U.S. TradFi markets with a second spot ETF approval via 21Shares, adding another touch point for demand.

Yet, momentum indicators suggest early reversal signs. The RSI has steadied at 40 after a sharp pullback from near-overbought levels, signaling easing sell pressure. The MACD histogram shows a similar shift, flattening into what could mark a local bottom for the Dogecoin price. If buyers mount another retest of the channel’s upper boundary, the fuel of ETF adoption and continued macro easing could create a breakout setup. Fully realized, the pattern would eye a return to Dogecoin’s all-time high at $0.48 for a 100% gain , opening the doors to new price discovery. A continued 3 70% move to the $1 milestone , however, will likely hinge on long-term adoption through ETFs and corporate treasury integration, embedding DOGE deeper into U.S. financial markets. The Next Bull Run Could See A Different Doge Coin Go Parabolic With this bullish setup, Dogecoin continues to demonstrate a trend: the strongest social momentum lies with doge-branded tokens. Dogecoin sparked the movement in 2021, followed by Shiba Inu, Floki, Bonk, Dogwifhat, Neiro, and most recently Dowge. The pattern is clear: doge-themed coins drive the biggest waves of social momentum. This time, speculators have their eyes on Maxi Doge ($MAXI) as the next to take off. Maxi Doge presale website.

Since 2021, officials say they targeted 203 people who failed to pay local levies. Of those, crypto from 161 individuals was already frozen or taken, with the city estimating the recovered value at about 1.5 billion won (roughly $1.1 million). City Opens Exchange Account According to city statements, Cheongju created a trading account on a domestic crypto exchange to make seizure and conversion easier. The change matters because it lets officials not only freeze assets but also sell them and apply the proceeds to overdue tax bills. Officials told reporters they now have a clearer path to turn crypto holdings into cash for tax recovery. How The Seizures Are Carried Out Reports describe a multi-step process. Tax offices identify residents with unpaid bills. They then request information from exchanges to see whether those people hold virtual assets. When ownership is confirmed, exchanges are ordered to suspend transactions or to transfer the assets to the municipal account. If the taxpayer does not settle the debt, the city may liquidate the holdings and use the proceeds to cover what is owed. Other Local Governments Have Taken Similar Steps Several other South Korean cities and districts have used similar tactics. Jeju City investigated 2,962 people for unpaid taxes and found 49 of them holding crypto worth about 230 million won. Jeju’s wider unpaid-tax list totaled about 19.7 billion won. Gwacheon, in Gyeonggi Province, built an “electronic virtual asset seizing system” and has recovered roughly 300 million won over recent years, targeting residents who owe more than three million won in local taxes. Paju sent notices to 17 people who owed about 124 million won and has previously seized around 100 million won in similar cases. Implications And Concerns The moves underline how local governments are pressing exchanges for data and exercising legal powers to collect taxes. Some citizens and observers worry about transparency and due process. Questions include how quickly exchanges must act, whether taxpayers receive fair notice, and how volatility is handled when assets are sold. Reports also note growing use of data tools, including AI, by some cities to find undeclared holdings. City Officials Say They Want Compliance Based on reports, city leaders framed the actions as an effort to stop tax evasion through virtual assets. They have warned residents that cryptocurrency cannot be used to hide from tax obligations. Still, legal challenges could arise, and appeals from affected residents may push some cases into the courts.

The company aims to raise $550 million through a mix of PIPE financing and equity-linked products, with the goal of accumulating more than $700 million worth of AVAX tokens. Supported by Hivemind Capital and more than 50 institutions, including Galaxy Digital and Kraken, the move establishes Avalanche as a major player in institutional-grade blockchain adoption. SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci has also joined as an advisor, highlighting growing Wall Street confidence in Avalanche’s role in the asset tokenization revolution. Technical Outlook: AVAX Bulls Defend Key Levels From a technical perspective, AVAX has broken through key resistance levels while remaining stable above its $32–$34 support zone. The token moves within an ascending channel, supported by the 20-day EMA at $30.43, with all major moving averages signaling bullish momentum. The RSI hovers around 71, suggesting slightly overbought conditions, but momentum indicators remain strong. Analysts identify $37 as the next key resistance level. A breakout could unlock higher targets at $40 and eventually $47–$50, aligning with liquidity maps that mark this zone as a major supply area. Tokenization Momentum and On-Chain Data Avalanche’s bullish case is further supported by its growing ecosystem. On-chain flows indicate net inflows of $3.26 million on September 23, signaling renewed accumulation. Futures open interest has also increased to nearly $1.8 billion, highlighting strong leveraged demand. Meanwhile, Avalanche’s growing role in tokenization, already tested by global players like Apollo and JPMorgan, provides a fundamental tailwind. With ETF filings underway and AVAX One’s treasury build-up reducing circulating supply, the long-term trajectory appears robust.

Experts had expected a reading of 51.1. Germany gains while France slips Fresh data revealed a sharp split between the region’s two largest economies. Germany showed strong improvement, while France struggled with ongoing political troubles that hurt business confidence. “The composite PMI for manufacturing and the service sector in the euro area rose slightly again in September. It thus continued its slight upward trend,” said Ralph Solveen at Commerzbank. “The improvement in recent months is solely attributable to a rise in the German index, while there are no signs of improvement in the other countries.” Germany’s PMI jumped to a 16-month peak of 52.4, beating predictions that called for a small increase to 50.6 from 50.5. But France told a different story – activity shrank for the thirteenth month running and at the quickest rate since April, with its PMI dropping to 48.4. “From a country perspective, France stands out negatively. The PMI dropped to the lowest level since April, with declines in both manufacturing and services,” said Bert Colijn at ING. “That stands in contrast to Germany, where services activity picked up according to the PMI. With heightened political uncertainty, the French economy appears to be mirroring this sense of instability.” Last week, hundreds of thousands of people joined protests across France against budget cuts. The demonstrators wanted the previous government’s spending plans thrown out, more money for public services, higher taxes on rich people, and changes to an unpopular rule that makes people work longer before they can retire. In Britain, which left the European Union, companies said they felt less confident and things were slowing down. They worried about possible new taxes in finance minister Rachel Reeves’ budget coming in November. The British PMI also showed fewer people getting hired. Service companies drove the eurozone’s overall growth The services PMI went up to 51.4 from 50.5 in August – the best reading in nine months and much better than experts thought, who predicted no change at all. But manufacturing moved in the wrong direction. That sector’s main number fell into shrinking territory at 49.5 from 50.7 in August. Job numbers stayed flat in September, ending six months of new hiring as companies reacted to the lack of new business coming in. Factories kept cutting workers, while service companies hired people at the slowest pace in seven months. Signs point to little chance of a quick turnaround. The measure that tracks new business orders – which shows demand – fell to exactly 50.0 from 50.3. Price pressures got weaker during the month. Both the costs companies pay and the prices they charge customers went up more slowly than before. Manufacturing companies saw their costs go down for the first time in three months. Service firms still faced high price increases, but not as steep as before, and they raised their own prices at the weakest rate since May. “The services output price PMI – which policymakers might watch particularly closely as a guide to domestic price pressures – declined to 52.7, leaving it only a touch above its 2019 average of 52.4,” said Jack Allen-Reynolds at Capital Economics. The European Central Bank kept interest rates the same earlier this month. Another survey suggests the bank has finished cutting rates for now. The mixed picture shows the eurozone economy growing but facing headwinds. While Germany’s strength helped lift overall numbers, France’s struggles and weak demand across the region raise questions about how long this modest expansion can last.

Confidence in institutional adoption grew this week after Morgan Stanley confirmed it will add crypto trading via Zerohash to its E*Trade platform starting in late 2026. Users will gain direct access to Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and Solana (SOL), marking a significant step toward mainstream integration. Morgan Stanley is partnering with cryptocurrency infrastructure provider Zerohash to let E*Trade clients trade popular coins beginning in the first half of next year https://t.co/t7ibOCdHW5 — Bloomberg (@business) September 23, 2025 This particular move positions Morgan Stanley against rivals like Charles Schwab and Robinhood, both of which already offer crypto-linked products. With Bitcoin representing around $2.25 trillion of the market’s $3.9 trillion value, Wall Street’s deeper involvement highlights how integral digital assets have become to global finance. Morgan Stanley’s E*Trade crypto launch set for late 2026 Access to Bitcoin, Ether, and Solana at rollout Wall Street competition intensifies with Schwab, Robinhood BlackRock’s ETF Profits Fuel Optimism BlackRock’s booming ETF business is also reinforcing institutional confidence. According to Onchain Foundation’s Leon Waidmann, BlackRock’s Bitcoin and Ether ETFs are now generating $260 million in annual revenue, including $218 million from Bitcoin products alone. The firm’s Bitcoin ETF has nearly $85 billion in assets under management, making it one of the largest globally, even compared to traditional funds.

Analysts argue these products could anchor BTC in retirement portfolios, potentially fueling a run toward $200,000 by year’s end if momentum continues. SEC Exemption Could Unlock Growth Adding to the bullish backdrop, SEC Chair Paul Atkins signaled plans for a crypto “innovation exemption” by December 2025. This initiative, part of Project Crypto, aims to reduce regulatory friction and modernize securities laws. Potential exemptions could include ICOs, airdrops, and network incentives—opening the door for more ETFs and structured crypto products. Atkins stressed that the U.S. must aim to become the global leader in digital asset innovation. Traders welcomed the announcement, with Bitcoin stabilizing around $111,000 as regulatory clarity boosted confidence. Bitcoin Technical Forecast: Eyes on $110K On the technical front, Bitcoin price prediction in the near term remains cautious. The breakdown below $115,000 pushed the price under both the 50-EMA ($114,300) and 200-EMA ($114,100), flipping them into resistance. The chart shows a base forming near $112,000, with long lower wicks hinting at dip-buying, although momentum is weak, with the RSI at 38. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Failure to defend $112,000 could expose $110,850, then $108,750. Deeper selling might drag BTC to $107,250. Conversely, a recovery above $113,450 would open the path to $114,750–$116,150, and potentially retest $118,000. While short-term participants may remain defensive, the broader uptrend of higher lows since summer is intact. If institutional inflows accelerate and macro liquidity gets better, Bitcoin could stage a rebound toward $120,000, framing this pullback as a long-term accumulation opportunity. Presale Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Combines BTC Security With Solana Speed Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). Its goal is to expand the BTC ecosystem by enabling lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation.

Calderon, 39, announced his candidacy on Tuesday in a video posted to social media, where he emphasized the need for a “new generation of leadership” to tackle California’s affordability crisis. It’s time for a new generation of leadership in California. pic.twitter.com/WmXIJcC1j1 — Ian Calderon (@IanCalderon) September 23, 2025 Calderon Brings Pro-Bitcoin Agenda to Crowded California Democratic Primary Calderon is no stranger to politics. First elected to the Assembly in 2012 to represent District 57 in Los Angeles County, he later served as Assembly Majority Leader from 2016 to 2020. He chose not to seek reelection in 2020, citing a desire to spend more time with his young family, and went on to launch lobbying firm Majority Advisors, where he has been CEO. His candidacy also extends the legacy of a political family with deep ties to Sacramento. His father, Charles Calderon, held seats in both the Assembly and Senate, while his uncles Ron and Tom also served in the legislature. His stepmother, Lisa Calderon, now represents the same district he once did. What distinguishes Calderon’s campaign is his open endorsement of Bitcoin. In his first post to X following the announcement, he declared his vision for California to become “the undisputed leader on Bitcoin,” a message he also reiterated in his campaign video. California has always been a leader on technology. It's time for us to get back to our roots and make California the undisputed leader on Bitcoin. — Ian Calderon (@IanCalderon) September 23, 2025 His position builds on earlier efforts during his time in office, when he explored the potential for Bitcoin integration at the state level, despite constitutional limits on states recognizing legal tender. The announcement comes as California, home to major crypto firms such as Coinbase, continues to play a pivotal role in shaping national tech and financial policy. Calderon’s pro-crypto stance could attract donations from Silicon Valley and the broader digital asset community, potentially giving him an edge in campaign financing. His entry further complicates the race to replace Governor Gavin Newsom, who cannot run again in 2026. Other Democratic contenders already in the field include former U.S. Representative Katie Porter, former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, Los Angeles’ former mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, state senator Toni Atkins, and Diamond Resorts founder Stephen Cloobeck. For Bitcoin, Calderon’s candidacy indicates how digital assets are moving into mainstream political debates. While his campaign faces a competitive field, his pro-Bitcoin platform ensures cryptocurrency will remain part of California’s 2026 gubernatorial conversation. California Pushes Digital Asset Adoption With New Laws and Pilot Programs California is advancing a sweeping framework for digital assets, positioning itself alongside New York as a key regulatory state. Governor Gavin Newsom signed the Digital Financial Assets Law (DFAL) last year , a licensing regime set to take effect in July 2025. The law requires all individuals and firms offering crypto services in the state to obtain a license from the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI), with strict obligations for audits, record-keeping, and consumer safeguards. Noncompliant firms risk enforcement actions. The DFPI has been given 18 months to implement the law, which is widely viewed as California’s equivalent to New York’s BitLicense. License holders will be required to keep financial records for at least five years, including detailed monthly ledgers of assets and liabilities. California Assembly unanimously approves crypto payments bill. AB-1180 now heads to the Senate. #crypto #California https://t.co/HCk96E5CxN — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 4, 2025 Lawmakers have also advanced complementary legislation. In June, the Assembly unanimously approved AB 1180 , creating a pilot program for paying state fees with digital assets. The program will run until 2031 and requires DFPI to submit a detailed report by 2028 on transaction volumes, challenges, and potential broader adoption. California just passed AB 1052 (78–0), shielding unclaimed crypto from automatic liquidation. #CryptoLaw #AB1052 https://t.co/Pyz8k3Xn1Z — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 5, 2025 Separately, AB 1052 was approved to update unclaimed property laws , ensuring dormant cryptocurrencies held by custodians are preserved in their native form rather than liquidated.

The Brazilian media outlet Livecoins reported that the BCB has released a public consultation paper calling for feedback on its proposals. Forex Rules: Crypto Exchanges to Feel Effect? These proposals focus mainly on Forex platforms, known as eFX in Brazil (short for electronic foreign exchange). In fact, the bank did not make any direct reference to crypto exchanges in its proposals, nor to crypto transactions. But, in their current form, the rules would impact crypto exchange platforms that allow their customers to make international transfers or sell coins for fiats other than the Brazilian real. The BCB is keen to move the largely unregulated Forex industry under its supervisory umbrella. Its proposals include forcing existing and new Forex providers to apply for regulatory permits. Forex platforms would also have to submit data on their clients’ transactions and use designated on/off ramps for client withdrawals and deposits. Furthermore, the proposals advocated capping individual transactions at a value equivalent to $10,000. And the BCB wants to oblige forex platforms to boost their transparency criteria, displaying the real and full cost to customers of each individual transaction they make. Crypto exchanges that allow their customers to make transfers to international accounts “may also be affected,” the media outlet warned. The rules would also have an impact on crypto exchanges that operate from outside Brazil, with traders also potentially limited by $10,000 transaction caps. Source: Ariadne ariadnerb Crypto’s Rising LATAM Appeal The outlet noted that the proposals “do not address” investment functions on eFX platforms, but instead focus “only on currency transactions.” The consultation period runs until November 2, the bank wrote in its document.

Harald, who had been absent from XRP discussions for several months, returned with a bullish comment suggesting that the digital asset may soon attempt a significant upward move, potentially toward the $4 range. His statement has reignited speculation within the community, with several other analysts adding their own perspectives. Market Overview XRP has been consolidating around the $3 level for several weeks, with price movements showing limited momentum in either direction. At the start of the week, the token fell to $2.77 before recovering slightly to $2.82. This performance follows a retreat from a recent swing high of $3.66, reached two months ago, after which the asset lost roughly 25% of its value. As of report time, XRP is trading at $2.86. Market participants have noted that the prolonged stagnation near $3 could soon give way to a breakout. To reach $4 from current levels, XRP would need to advance by more than 42%. Such a move would establish a new all-time high, as the token has not traded above $3.84 since 2018. When Harry speaks I listen XRP $4.00 https://t.co/0Bpfx0cnjH — Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL) September 21, 2025 Harald’s recent comment, shared on social media over the weekend, was his first public statement on XRP since May. His reentry into the conversation drew considerable attention from the community, with prominent influencer Alex Cobb remarking that Harald’s views hold weight and indicating that he sees $4 as the next logical target. Technical Indicators Suggest Rebound Other analysts have supported this bullish outlook through technical analysis. Market strategist Ali Martinez highlighted that XRP’s four-hour chart has issued a TD Sequential buy signal, an indicator often associated with the conclusion of a downtrend after several consecutive lower closes. Martinez suggested this may mark a favorable entry point for buyers. In addition, legal expert and XRP supporter Bill Morgan cited data from Grok AI that demonstrates the TD Sequential’s reliability. According to Grok’s analysis, the indicator has historically shown 60–70% accuracy on higher timeframes. Notably, three out of four buy signals on the two-week chart since 2022 have led to substantial rallies. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Independent trader Unipcs also noted structural improvements in XRP’s chart. According to him, the asset broke a key downtrend line after reaching a low of $2.69 on September 1. Although he does not personally hold XRP, he emphasized that the technical setup favors further gains, making it difficult to maintain a bearish stance. Similarly, analyst Gonzo pointed to XRP’s ability to stay above both the 50% Fibonacci retracement level and the 50-day moving average, describing these as positive signs for continued upward momentum. Fundamental Drivers and ETF Speculation Beyond technical analysis, optimism is also being fueled by potential fundamental catalysts. Growing speculation around the possibility of a U.S.-listed XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) has created enthusiasm among investors. Reports suggest that a decision from the Securities and Exchange Commission could arrive as soon as next month. If approved, many analysts believe the introduction of such a product would attract significant institutional capital into the market, providing strong support for a potential price surge. With XRP consolidating near $3 for an extended period, anticipation is mounting over its next directional move. Harald’s positive projection, combined with technical indicators and renewed ETF speculation, has strengthened the case for a possible advance toward $4 . While market conditions remain uncertain, analysts generally agree that the current environment makes it increasingly difficult to justify a bearish outlook on XRP.

Businesses ranging from online gaming firms to golf cart makers changed their strategies to purchase cryptocurrencies just two months ago. Now these same companies are trying to boost their falling stock prices through share buybacks. Some are even taking on debt to pay for these stock purchases. Seven companies have made these moves in recent weeks. Five of them now have stock values lower than what their cryptocurrency holdings are worth. Investors are getting worried about too many companies doing the same thing and questioning whether this business approach actually works. “It’s probably the death rattle for a few of these companies,” said Adam Morgan McCarthy, who works as a senior research analyst at Kaiko, a company that studies cryptocurrency data. On Monday, Vivek Ramaswamy’s investment firm Strive Asset Management purchased Semler Scientific. This healthcare technology company had switched to collecting bitcoin. This deal shows how companies trading below their crypto values are becoming targets for takeovers. This year, dozens of companies rushed to borrow money or sell new shares to raise cash for buying cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ether, and Solana. Some of these companies have backing from President Donald Trump and his family members. They followed the example of Michael Saylor, a well-known crypto investor. His company MicroStrategy saw its value climb above $100 billion this year after it started buying bitcoin in 2020. Crypto treasury companies are losing money Most crypto treasury companies are losing money or are basically empty shell companies. The only thing driving their stock prices up is executives and investors believing their digital tokens will gain value. A biotech firm called 180 Life Sciences renamed itself ETHZilla last month and started buying ether tokens. Its stock has dropped 76 percent from its August high point. The company is worth $416 million, even though it owns about $460 million worth of ether. Last week, ETHZilla borrowed $80 million using its ether holdings as collateral from Cumberland DRW, the crypto division of market maker DRW run by Don Wilson. The company plans to use this money to buy its own shares as part of a $250 million buyback program. “We continue to view repurchasing shares as opportunistic and an accretive use of capital,” said McAndrew Rudisill, who serves as ETHZilla’s chief executive. However, some experts think these buybacks show the crypto treasury business model might be finished. “It’s only been six months and we’re already talking about their demise,” said Elliot Chun, a partner at crypto advisory firm Architect Partners. “A very small percentage are going to succeed.” Chun explained that raising money to buy back shares instead of spending it on tokens goes against the whole crypto treasury idea. Public companies have been doing more share buybacks in recent years. Company leaders usually do this when they think their stock is undervalued. Real estate investment trusts often buy their own shares when their market value drops below what their properties are worth. But crypto treasury companies built their business on the idea that their stock value would rise faster than their crypto holdings. For companies now doing buybacks, this is not happening anymore. Morgan McCarthy from Kaiko said the companies are “just trying to buy time, sustain things, tide things over until they can capitalize on that next wave of crypto prices rising.” “It’s very circular,” he said about these buyback operations. “A lot of these companies are like a house of cards and are going to collapse very quickly.” If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

We’re talking about the phenomenal rise of Ethereum spot ETFs , which have rapidly carved out a significant slice of the total spot ETH trading volume. This isn’t just a minor trend; it’s a powerful indicator of how traditional finance is embracing digital assets. An Unprecedented Surge: Why Are Ethereum Spot ETFs Dominating? Just last November, Ethereum spot ETFs accounted for a mere 3% of the total spot ETH trading volume. Fast forward to today, and that figure has skyrocketed to an impressive 15%. This five-fold increase, as reported by The Block, highlights a clear preference emerging among investors. But what’s driving this unprecedented surge? The primary reason boils down to accessibility, security, and regulation. Many investors, particularly those coming from traditional financial backgrounds, are increasingly opting for regulated financial products over the complexities of directly managing cryptocurrencies. These ETFs offer a bridge, allowing exposure to Ethereum without the intricacies often associated with digital asset ownership. The Compelling Benefits of Investing via Ethereum Spot ETFs Investing in Ethereum spot ETFs presents several compelling advantages that resonate with a broad spectrum of investors: Simplified Exposure: Investors can gain exposure to ETH’s price movements without the need to set up and manage their own digital wallets, remember seed phrases, or navigate complex crypto exchanges. This significantly lowers the barrier to entry. Enhanced Security: By investing through an ETF, investors delegate the security responsibilities to professional custodians. This mitigates personal security risks, such as potential hacks or loss of private keys, which can be a major concern for direct token holders. Regulatory Assurance: ETFs operate within established financial frameworks, providing a layer of regulatory oversight that many traditional finance participants find reassuring. This trust factor is crucial for attracting larger institutional capital. Market Liquidity: The growth of these ETFs contributes to the overall liquidity of the Ethereum market, making it easier for investors to buy and sell their positions. Moreover, the influx of capital into these regulated products has had a tangible impact on the market. Ethereum (ETH) itself has seen a price increase of over 30% this year, partly fueled by the growing interest and investment channeled through these ETFs. This demonstrates the significant influence that regulated financial instruments can have on the underlying digital asset. What Does the Future Hold for Ethereum Spot ETFs? The trajectory for Ethereum spot ETFs appears set for continued expansion. As traditional financial infrastructure further integrates digital assets, we can expect the market share of these ETFs to grow even more. This ongoing integration is likely to pave the way for more sophisticated financial products and broader investor participation. However, it’s also important to acknowledge potential challenges. The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally, and future policy decisions could influence the growth trajectory. Market volatility, a hallmark of the crypto space, will also remain a factor for investors to consider. Despite these considerations, the current trend suggests a strong and enduring preference for regulated exposure to digital assets. The remarkable growth of Ethereum spot ETFs is not just a statistic; it’s a testament to the maturation of the crypto market and its increasing appeal to a wider investment audience. It signifies a pivotal moment where ease of access, security, and institutional trust are becoming paramount. This remarkable shift underscores the increasing confidence in Ethereum as a foundational asset within the digital economy. The continued evolution of these financial instruments will undoubtedly shape the future of crypto investment, making it more accessible and secure for everyone. Frequently Asked Questions About Ethereum Spot ETFs What are Ethereum spot ETFs? Ethereum spot ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) are investment vehicles that hold actual Ethereum (ETH) as their underlying asset. They allow investors to gain exposure to ETH’s price movements without directly owning or managing the cryptocurrency themselves. How do Ethereum spot ETFs differ from holding ETH directly?

This simplifies the investment process and reduces personal security risks, offering a more traditional investment experience. Who is investing in Ethereum spot ETFs? Both institutional and retail investors are showing a strong preference for Ethereum spot ETFs . Institutions appreciate the regulatory compliance and ease of integration into existing portfolios, while retail investors benefit from simplified access and reduced security concerns. What impact have Ethereum spot ETFs had on ETH’s price? The increased inflows into these ETFs have contributed to a positive sentiment and demand for Ethereum. The Block reported that ETH’s price has risen by more than 30% this year, partly attributed to the growing interest channeled through these regulated products. What is the future outlook for Ethereum spot ETFs? The outlook is largely positive. As traditional financial infrastructure continues to integrate digital assets, the market share of Ethereum spot ETFs is expected to grow further. This trend suggests a move towards more mainstream adoption and regulated investment in cryptocurrencies. If you found this analysis insightful, please share it with your network!

In 2028, Floki Inu is predicted to reach a maximum price of $0.000430. FLOKI price can reach a maximum level of $0.000699 and an average trading price of $0.000673 in 2031. Floki Inu is a meme coin driven by its community, the Floki Vikings. Inspired by Shiba Inu, Floki Inu aims to democratize power in the crypto space, pivoting the crypto market away from traditional financial entities. The Floki project ecosystem is diverse. It includes Valhalla, a blockchain combat game that rewards players with Floki tokens, and Floki Places, a store for merchandise and NFTs where purchases can be made using Floki tokens. Additionally, Floki University provides educational resources on the cryptocurrency market and blockchain technology. The recent launch (June 30, 2025) of the Valhalla mainnet of opBNB, coupled with DeFi partnerships like Chainlink, collectively enhances Floki Inu’s value and future potential by driving demand and expanding its use. Having attained its all-time high of $0.0003462 on June 5, 2024, can FLOKI reach $1?

If FLOKI loses $0.000084, it risks further decline toward $0.000080. FLOKI on the daily timeframe FLOKI’s daily chart for September 23 shows a sharp sell-off with the candle closing at $0.00008557, following a deep plunge that touched the lower Bollinger Band at $0.00008437. The RSI sits at 37.78, signaling oversold conditions, while the MACD has crossed bearishly, confirming downward pressure. However, today’s small green candle forming above the band suggests early signs of stabilizing. FLOKIUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView A recovery could push the price toward $0.00009607 (mid-Bollinger), but sustained buying strength is needed. On the downside, losing $0.00008400 risks further decline toward $0.00008000. Buyers looking for entries may consider around $0.00008450–0.00008500 with profit-taking near $0.000095–0.000096. FLOKI on the 4-hour timeframe On the 4-hour chart, FLOKI trades at $0.00008556 with mild recovery candles forming after the sharp drop. The Alligator indicator shows all three lines fanned out downward, reinforcing bearish momentum, while MACD remains negative though easing. FLOKIUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView Short-term resistance sits at $0.00008815, and only a break above $0.00009041 would hint at a stronger recovery. Support remains tight around $0.00008450. Volume has slowed, suggesting the market is awaiting a fresh direction.

Recovery is only convincing above $0.00008800–$0.00009000, with $0.00009600 as the key upside target. A drop below $0.00008400 would likely send FLOKI toward $0.00008000. Is Floki Inu a good investment? FLOKI INU could be a big win or a big loss. It’s backed by a strong Floki community and consistent ecosystem developments, which can drive short-and long-term gains. But it’s risky, with price swings and unclear long-term value. Only invest if you’re comfortable with the risk. Will FLOKI reach $0.001? Expert analysis suggests that the $0.001 price point is achievable, provided utility grows and investor interest increases enough to drive FLOKI up ~11x its current market cap. Will Floki reach $0.01? FLOKI would need up to $95 billion market cap to hit $0.01, over 110x its current value. Only the top six cryptos have surpassed this level, making it a major challenge without massive growth in adoption and demand. While possible, it’s unlikely in the short term. Does FLOKI have a good long-term future? According to expert analysis, FLOKI has a promising long-term future with consistent growth potential. The coin could reach up to $0.002 within the decade.

Pseudonymous market analyst MMBTtrader recently commented that the current environment appears “dead” and increasingly discouraging for holders. The analyst suggested that if present conditions persist, SHIB could risk dropping out of the top 40 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Despite this pessimistic description of current performance, the same analyst outlined a scenario in which SHIB could recover significantly, citing strong support levels and technical structures that may set the stage for a substantial breakout. Key Supports Remain Intact According to MMBTtrader , SHIB is still defending two important daily support zones, located near $0.000006 and $0.000010. Historically, these levels have provided stability and marked the starting points of earlier upward rallies. As long as these supports remain intact, the possibility of a future rebound remains on the table. The analyst emphasized that price action is currently constrained by a descending trendline that has acted as resistance for months. Breaking through this red trendline would be a critical step for bulls to regain control of the market. The 200% Milestone as Immediate Resistance Before any larger rally can be attempted, SHIB must first clear a major resistance barrier near $0.00003364. This level has already been tested multiple times in recent history, most notably in March and December 2024. On both occasions, buying pressure was unable to sustain momentum, and the market experienced sharp reversals. Because of this repeated rejection, the $0.00003364 region has now become a well-established ceiling for the token. MMBTtrader argues that successfully breaking through this barrier is essential to unlock further upside. If the resistance is overcome, the analyst projects an immediate rally of about 200% from current prices. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Roadmap Toward 400% and 600% Targets Should SHIB manage to establish a foothold above $0.00003364, the analyst believes a path would open toward larger price objectives. The next milestone would be a 400% rally, a level last observed in November 2021. This target would represent a significant recovery from current values, exhibiting renewed strength in the market. The long-term projection, however, lies at $0.00007730, Shiba Inu’s all-time high reached in October 2021. Achieving this price would equate to gains exceeding 600% from current levels. The analyst clarified that this outlook is conditional on the token holding its established supports and decisively breaking through the long-standing descending trendline that has capped its price movements. While MMBTtrader’s description of the market as “dead” highlights current investor frustration, the analysis ultimately suggests that SHIB’s long-term prospects are not entirely negative. With crucial support levels still intact and with resistance zones clearly identified, Shiba Inu retains the potential to stage a significant recovery. However, until the token can close above $0.00003364, progress toward the higher 400% and 600% targets remains speculative.

52171326,587084,1758672033,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52171326.jpeg,Helius Takes First Step In Solana Treasury With $175 Million Purchase,https://bitcoinist.com/helius-solana-treasury-175-million-sol-purchase/,"Helius Medical Technologies has officially kick-started its Solana (SOL) treasury strategy with an initial acquisition of 760,190 tokens. Helius Has Started Buying Solana With Its $500 Million Raise As announced in a press release , Helius Medical Technologies has completed its first Solana purchase for its digital asset treasury strategy. In total, the company has acquired 760,190 SOL at an average price of $231 per token, spending about $175 million. Originally a neurotech company, Helius Medical Technologies adopted a strategy focused on accumulating SOL earlier this month. Just a few days ago, the firm revealed that it had raised over $500 million for its digital asset treasury through a private placement offering. Among the key backers were Pantera Capital , an American venture capital and hedge fund specializing in blockchain and digital assets, and Summer Capital, a Hong Kong-headquartered investment firm. Joseph Chee, Executive Chairman at Helius, said: It has been gratifying to receive shows of support from multiple stakeholders across the Solana ecosystem, including staking providers, DeFi protocols and others. We take our responsibility to maximize shareholder value seriously and are eager to execute against our plan. With the latest purchase, Helius has begun deploying the raised capital into Solana. The company still has $335 million sitting in cash reserves for further treasury expansions, along with the potential to raise another $750 million if the stapled warrants from its private placement are exercised. The press release noted that, besides SOL being among the top coins in on-chain activity-related metrics, it’s also financially productive by design, thanks to its 7% native staking yield. Helius added: As an independent treasury company, HSDT’s mission is to support the growth and security of tokenized networks by serving as a long-term holder of $SOL, in addition to continuing the development of its neurotech and medical device operations The NASDAQ-listed neurotech firm isn’t the only one to pivot to a Solana treasury this month. Forward Industries, a company focused on design and manufacturing, also adopted a SOL strategy and closed a private investment in public equity (PIPE) earlier in September, raising $1.65 billion. The financing was led by three key players in Galaxy Digital, Multicoin Capital, and Jump Crypto. Last Monday, the firm executed its first purchase worth $1.58 billion, instantly becoming the largest SOL treasury holder in the world. In some other news, analytics firm Santiment has shared an update on how projects in the Solana ecosystem compare against each other in terms of the Development Activity metric. From the table, it’s visible that SOL continues to be the top-ranked coin with its developers putting in the most work on the project’s public GitHub repositories. Wormhole (W) and Pyth Network (PYTH) follow in second and third, respectively. SOL Price At the time of writing, Solana is trading around $218, down over 7% in the last week.",Solana|Helius|Helius Solana|SOL|solana|Solana Treasury|SOLUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SOL|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-24 00:00:33
52169499,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=826110,1758672056,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/52169499.jpeg,Bitcoin Consolidation Phase: Why Chop Is A Normal Aftermath Of Extreme Volatility,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-consolidation-phase/,"Following a period of intense volatility and a significant price movement, Bitcoin’s market is now experiencing a predictable consolidation phase, characterized by what traders call intraday chop. This is not a sign of weakness but rather a natural and often necessary stage in any market cycle. A Necessary Foundation For The Next Move In an X post, a dedicated crypto enthusiast, Uniswap Gems, provided a clear-eyed view of Bitcoin’s current price action, stating that the market is in a predictable phase of intraday chop after a period of extreme volatility. Related Reading: Countdown To ‘Bitcoin Bottom Day’: Why September 21 Could Change Everything Uniswap Gems noted that the recent huge, volatile move caught many traders off guard. As a result, the market is now in a period of consolidation. This chop is a sideways price movement within a tight range, which is often needed to establish a solid bottom after a sharp price swing. He cautions that this phase could last for the next 2 to 3 days, making it a difficult environment for those looking for quick directional trades. For a bullish trend to resume, BTC needs to flip $113,000 into a support level. If this happens, it could set the stage for a retest of the $115,000 range. However, if BTC fails to hold its current levels and makes new local lows, Uniswap Gems expects a more significant drop all the way down to sub $105,000, which would be a decisive move to the downside. Analyst Philakone, a crypto investor and day trader, has issued a stark reminder about the inherent volatility of BTC and historical price action in bear markets. His analysis focuses on the severe drawdowns that have consistently followed previous all-time highs. According to Philakone, BTC price has a historical tendency to drop between 75% to 85% from its peak during a bear market. This is a crucial point that he believes many people struggle to grasp, especially after a prolonged bull run. However, if BTC’s all-time high for the current cycle reaches $125,000, a 75% drop would bring the price down to a mere $30,000. Market Still Fragile Despite Heavy Liquidations Crypto trader known as KillaXBT has adopted a highly cautious stance on the BTC market. For the first time in a while, the expert is fading this BTC dip despite a massive liquidation event of 1.5 billion. His decision is based on a technical analysis of a key market indicator of the USDT dominance chart. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Retreats Lower Again – Is This Just a Healthy Dip? KillaXBT explains that the USDT.D (Tether Dominance) chart is showing concerning signals. If it breaks above its Equal Highs (EQHs), it could lead to a bigger drop in price.

Pham announced Tuesday. In a statement, the agency said its Global Markets Advisory Committee (GMAC), led by Pham, had last year recommended that regulators adopt “the use of non-cash collateral through distributed ledger technology.” Tokenized collateral can make contracts like futures and swaps more ‘efficient’. Ripple’s Senior Vice President of Stablecoins, Jack McDonald, says the tokenization of real-world assets, even future cash flows, is a trend that is rapidly advancing in financial technology.” Collateral is also used as security for traders’ obligations on derivatives contracts, mitigating the risk of default. CFTC pushes tokenized collateral to modernize derivatives markets The initiative is part of the CFTC’s great push to modernize capital markets and provide clear guidance for crypto firms. Specifically, it builds on the agency’s so-called “crypto sprint” to implement the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets report recommendations. Just recently, Congress passed the first crypto-specific bill to regulate stablecoins under the GENIUS Act . Federal regulators, including the Treasury Department, are still working out how to implement that law best. Likewise, the CFTC invites industry stakeholders to submit suggestions “on using tokenized collateral” in derivatives markets. Written comments are due by Oct. 20. Pham has also suggested launching a digital asset regulatory sandbox in the U.S. to test new market structures. “The public has spoken: tokenized markets are here, and they are the future,” Pham said. She added that the CFTC is pressing forward at the forefront of responsible innovation, and she values the support of their industry partners. The CFTC’s press release notably included statements from Circle, Coinbase, Crypto.com, and Ripple executives. In February, the agency outlined plans for a non-cash collateral pilot using stablecoins, with participation from those firms and MoonPay. Crypto industry leaders join advisory committees to shape policy Just days earlier, the CFTC appointed new members to its Global Markets Advisory Committee and subcommittees, adding several crypto industry leaders to the Digital Asset Markets Subcommittee (DAMS), underscoring the regulator’s continued engagement with the sector. Pham called out new DAMS members, including Katherine Minarik, chief legal officer at Uniswap Labs; Avery Ching, co-founder and CEO of Aptos Labs; James J. Hill, managing director and head of structure innovation at BNY; and Ben Sherwin, general counsel at Chainlink Labs. Scott Lucas, head of digital assets at JPMorgan, was also appointed co-chair of DAMS alongside Sandy Kaul, executive vice president at Franklin Templeton. They took over from Caroline Butler, who initially served as co-chair. “We look forward to working with the Commission and broader industry partners to help shape clear and effective regulatory frameworks in a well-structured digital asset market,” Lucas said. Kaul also said she intends to advance digital asset innovation into the mainstream “with prudent and well-designed consumer protections, enabling greater efficiencies and opportunities for all investors.” The DAMS was formed to offer the CFTC expert advice on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and tokenized markets, directing the agency on risk exposure and potential opportunity, in addition to policy recommendations and forging connections between traditional financial infrastructure and decentralized alternatives through close collaboration with CFTC staff. Pham was appointed CFTC Acting Chair on January 20, President Donald Trump’s inauguration day, and had served as a Commissioner since April 2022. Her current commissioner term is set to run through April 2027, giving her time to continue serving as chair until a permanent replacement is appointed.

52170055,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=817288,1758672520,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52170055.jpeg,"OpenAI reveals Stargate AI facility in Texas, projects planned in five more states",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/openai-reveals-stargate-ai-facility-texas/,"OpenAI revealed plans Tuesday to build six large computer facilities across the country, adding to its current Texas location as part of a massive $500 billion spending plan that President Donald Trump highlighted earlier this year. The company behind ChatGPT is working with Oracle and Softbank through a partnership called Stargate to construct these new sites. Two more will go up in Texas, with additional locations planned for New Mexico, Ohio, and another Midwest state that hasn’t been named yet. The biggest project sits in Abilene, Texas, where city leaders say the development is changing their old railroad community. Oracle officials who toured the eight-building site said it’s already set to become the world’s largest computer cluster for artificial intelligence work once construction wraps up. The complex will house hundreds of thousands of specialized computer chips. Sam Altman from OpenAI admitted that most people don’t think about what happens behind the scenes when they use ChatGPT. He and Clay Magouyrk, Oracle’s new co-chief, talked about their efforts to limit environmental damage in this dry part of West Texas, where temperatures reached 97 degrees Tuesday. “We’re burning gas to run this data center,” Altman said, though he noted that Stargate hopes to use different power sources as the project grows. The Texas facility needs roughly 900 megawatts of electricity to run all eight buildings and their computer chips. One building is already working, and a second that the executives visited Tuesday is almost done. Each equipment rack holds 72 of Nvidia’s GB200 chips, which handle the most demanding artificial intelligence tasks. Each building should contain about 60,000 of these chips. Residents have mixed reactions to the OpenAI project Not all residents are pleased because of the facility’s water and power requirements. The city’s water reservoirs were about half-full this week. People must follow a twice-weekly outdoor watering schedule, alternating days based on whether their house numbers are odd or even. The cooling system needs one million gallons from the city water supplies for its initial setup. Shaolei Ren, a University of California, Riverside professor who studies environmental effects of artificial intelligence, said the closed-loop cooling system shows developers care about local water supplies. But he noted these systems need more electricity, which means more indirect water use through power generation. Most residents first heard about Stargate when Trump announced it after returning to office in January. Originally planned for cryptocurrency mining, developers changed and expanded their plans for the artificial intelligence boom that ChatGPT started. The partnership said it was investing $100 billion initially, possibly reaching $500 billion, to build large data centers and power systems for AI development. OpenAI recently signed a deal to buy $300 billion worth of computing power from Oracle, a major gamble for the San Francisco company that began as a nonprofit. OpenAI and Oracle brought reporters and politicians, including Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz, to tour the site Tuesday for the first time. Cruz called Texas “ground zero for AI” because anyone building data centers wants “abundant, low-cost energy.” Of the five other Stargate projects announced Tuesday, Oracle will work with OpenAI on one in New Mexico’s Doña Ana County and another in Shackelford County, Texas. The company also plans one in the Midwest. Softbank has started construction on two more in Lordstown, Ohio, and Milam County, Texas. These projects help OpenAI reduce its dependence on Microsoft, which was previously its only computing partner. Altman told reporters his company has been “severely limited for the value we can offer to people.” “ChatGPT is slow. It’s not as smart as we’d like to be. Many users can’t use it as much as they would like,” Altman said. “We have many other ideas and products we want to build.” Get $50 free to trade crypto when you sign up to Bybit now",Tech|OpenAI|Softbank,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|MINING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-24 00:08:40

This unexpected jump occurred shortly after Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), the disgraced founder of FTX, posted a simple ‘gm’ (good morning) on X, formerly Twitter, breaking a six-month silence. The post immediately captured the attention of the crypto community, triggering a short-term rally for the FTT token. What Sparked the FTT Token Price Rally? The cryptocurrency market is often highly sensitive to social media activity, especially from prominent figures, even those with controversial pasts. SBF’s ‘gm’ post, his first public communication in half a year, was enough to ignite speculation and enthusiasm among certain traders. This brief message, devoid of any specific news or updates regarding FTX or its future, nevertheless became a catalyst for rapid market movement. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the FTT token price skyrocketed to $1.19, marking an impressive increase of 43.24% in a short period. Such a dramatic percentage gain highlights the speculative nature of many altcoins and how quickly sentiment can shift based on seemingly minor events. Community Speculation: The post fueled immediate discussions and theories among crypto enthusiasts. Short-Term Trading: Many traders likely saw an opportunity for quick profits, contributing to the pump. Market Volatility: The event underscores the inherent volatility of the crypto space, where news, even vague social media posts, can have outsized effects. Who is Sam Bankman-Fried and Why Does His Post Matter? Sam Bankman-Fried, once hailed as a crypto prodigy, is currently serving a 21-year prison sentence. He was convicted on multiple fraud charges involving a staggering $11 billion, related to the collapse of his cryptocurrency exchange, FTX. His scheduled release date is in December 2044. Given his legal situation and long absence from public communication, his sudden ‘gm’ post was highly unusual and unexpected. Despite his incarceration, SBF remains a figure of intense interest in the crypto world. His past influence and the sheer scale of FTX’s collapse mean that any communication from him, however brief, is scrutinized. This attention can, as seen with the FTT token price , translate into immediate market reactions, driven by a mix of curiosity, speculation, and perhaps a touch of nostalgia or hope for some. However, it is crucial to remember the context of his current circumstances. Understanding the Dynamics of Sudden Crypto Pumps The rapid increase in the FTT token price following SBF’s post is a classic example of a ‘pump’ driven by sentiment rather than fundamental value. Such events are common in the crypto market and often short-lived. Investors frequently react to perceived signals or community hype, leading to quick price movements that may not be sustainable in the long run. For FTT, the native token of the now-defunct FTX exchange, its utility and future prospects are severely limited due to the ongoing bankruptcy proceedings and SBF’s conviction. Therefore, any significant price movement should be viewed with extreme caution. Fundamental Analysis: Always prioritize the underlying value and utility of a token over speculative pumps. Risk Management: Understand that investments based on social media hype carry significant risk. Market Manipulation: Be aware that such events can sometimes be orchestrated to manipulate prices for personal gain. What Does This Mean for the FTT Token and Its Future? While the recent surge in FTT token price created a buzz, it is unlikely to signal a fundamental shift in the token’s long-term outlook. The token’s value remains intrinsically tied to the fate of the FTX bankruptcy estate, and its future utility is highly questionable. Investors should exercise extreme diligence and skepticism when considering FTT as an investment. The incident serves as a potent reminder of the unique challenges and opportunities within the crypto market. While quick gains are possible, they often come with equally rapid losses. It underscores the importance of a well-researched investment strategy that looks beyond fleeting social media trends and focuses on robust projects with clear roadmaps and genuine utility. In conclusion, the brief ‘gm’ from Sam Bankman-Fried on X caused a notable, albeit likely temporary, surge in the FTT token price . This event highlights the powerful, sometimes irrational, influence of social media and prominent figures on cryptocurrency markets, even when fundamental factors remain unchanged. It is a compelling reminder for all participants to approach the market with a critical eye and a commitment to informed decision-making. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What caused the recent FTT token price surge? The FTT token price surged after FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) posted ‘gm’ (good morning) on X, breaking a six-month silence. This social media activity triggered speculation and short-term trading. Q2: Who is Sam Bankman-Fried and what is his current status? Sam Bankman-Fried is the founder of the collapsed FTX cryptocurrency exchange. He is currently serving a 21-year prison sentence after being convicted on fraud charges. Q3: Is the FTT token a good investment now? Given SBF’s conviction and the ongoing FTX bankruptcy, the FTT token’s future utility and value are highly uncertain. Any price surge based on social media activity is likely speculative and carries significant risk. Q4: How does influencer activity impact crypto prices? Cryptocurrency markets can be highly sensitive to influencer activity, even from controversial figures. Social media posts can quickly generate hype, speculation, and rapid price movements, often detached from fundamental value. Q5: What are the risks associated with investing in FTT? Risks include the token’s limited utility post-FTX collapse, ongoing bankruptcy proceedings, high volatility, and the potential for rapid price depreciation after speculative pumps.

A groundbreaking development in South Korea is setting a new standard for trust in the stablecoin sector. This pivotal move involves the first-ever KRWIN stablecoin custody agreement, designed specifically for international users. What is the Significance of KRWIN Stablecoin Custody? On September 24th, the fiat-collateralized stablecoin project KRWIN made a significant announcement. They revealed a virtual asset custody agreement with Korea Digital Asset (KODA). This isn’t just another partnership; it marks a historical first for South Korea. K-Clone, the operator behind KRWIN and a subsidiary of KOSDAQ-listed INITECH, confirmed that this is the nation’s inaugural custody service for a stablecoin targeting overseas users, even in its Proof of Concept (POC) phase. Why does this matter? It introduces a new level of institutional-grade security to the stablecoin ecosystem. This initiative directly addresses common concerns about stablecoin reserves and operational integrity. The focus on overseas users highlights South Korea’s ambition to be a global player in digital finance. Ensuring Transparency and Stability: How Does KRWIN Stablecoin Custody Work? The core of the KRWIN project operates on a strict 1:1 reserve principle. This means that every single KRWIN token issued on-chain will be fully deposited with KODA. Think of KODA as a highly secure digital vault, safeguarding the assets that back the stablecoin. Both the volume of tokens issued and the corresponding deposit records will be transparently verifiable on the blockchain ledger. This commitment to auditable reserves is crucial for building user confidence. Lee Sang-joon, CEO of K-Clone, emphasized that this early adoption of custody services isn’t just a technical detail; it’s a clear statement of the project’s dedication to transparency and stability. In a market often scrutinized for its volatility, such measures are invaluable. This proactive approach aims to mitigate risks and foster a more reliable environment for digital asset transactions. Expanding Horizons: KRWIN’s Vision for Southeast Asia Beyond the technical safeguards, KRWIN has ambitious plans for expansion. The company intends to broaden KRWIN’s utility across Southeast Asia. This strategic move will involve integrating the stablecoin with the thriving K-content industry, tourism, and various payment systems. By doing so, KRWIN aims to support and grow the wider K-content ecosystem, leveraging South Korea’s cultural influence. This expansion could unlock new opportunities for businesses and consumers alike. Imagine seamless cross-border payments for K-pop merchandise, Korean drama subscriptions, or even tourism packages, all powered by a stable and transparent digital currency. The vision is clear: to make digital transactions easier, safer, and more accessible for a global audience, starting with a strong foundation of KRWIN stablecoin custody . The Future of Digital Assets: A Glimpse into Trust The partnership between KRWIN and KODA represents a significant step forward in the institutionalization of digital assets. It demonstrates a proactive approach to regulatory compliance and user protection, which are essential for mainstream adoption. As the crypto world matures, such robust custody solutions will likely become the norm, not the exception. This development paves the way for greater trust and wider acceptance of stablecoins as a legitimate tool for international commerce and daily transactions. The commitment to verifiable reserves and secure custody underscores a growing trend towards greater accountability in the crypto space. This initiative could serve as a blueprint for other projects seeking to establish themselves as reliable and trustworthy players in the global digital economy. The future of digital finance looks brighter with initiatives like the KRWIN stablecoin custody agreement leading the charge. Summary: A New Era of Confidence The signing of South Korea’s first KRWIN stablecoin custody deal with KODA marks a pivotal moment for the digital asset industry. By prioritizing transparency, stability, and secure custody from its initial phase, KRWIN is setting a high standard for stablecoin projects, especially those targeting an international user base. This strategic move, coupled with plans for expansion into Southeast Asia via K-content and tourism, positions KRWIN not just as a stablecoin, but as a key enabler for a more integrated and trustworthy global digital economy. This is a testament to the growing maturity and institutional confidence in the crypto space, promising a more secure and accessible future for digital finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is KRWIN, and what is its primary purpose? A1: KRWIN is a fiat-collateralized stablecoin project. Its primary purpose is to provide a stable digital currency for overseas users, backed by traditional fiat reserves on a 1:1 basis, ensuring transparency and stability. Q2: What is the significance of the custody agreement between KRWIN and KODA? A2: This agreement is South Korea’s first virtual asset custody deal for a stablecoin aimed at international users. It means KODA will securely hold the reserves backing KRWIN tokens, enhancing transparency and stability, and allowing verification on the blockchain. Q3: How does the 1:1 reserve principle work for KRWIN? A3: The 1:1 reserve principle ensures that for every KRWIN token issued on the blockchain, an equivalent amount of fiat currency (or other collateral) is deposited with KODA. Both the issuance volume and deposit records are publicly verifiable on the blockchain. Q4: Where does KRWIN plan to expand its services? A4: KRWIN plans to expand its use cases across Southeast Asia. This expansion will involve linking the stablecoin to the K-content industry, tourism, and various payment systems to foster growth in the broader K-content ecosystem. Q5: How does this deal contribute to the overall trust in stablecoins? A5: By adopting institutional-grade custody services early, KRWIN demonstrates a strong commitment to transparency, security, and regulatory compliance. This proactive approach helps build user confidence and sets a precedent for greater accountability in the stablecoin market.

Currently, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index stands at 44, a slight uptick from yesterday but still firmly entrenched in the “fear” category. This crucial indicator helps us gauge the prevailing sentiment among investors, offering a snapshot of whether market participants are feeling overly cautious or excessively optimistic. Understanding this index is vital for anyone navigating the volatile world of digital assets. What Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Tell Us About Market Mood? When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index leans towards fear, it typically suggests that investors are hesitant, potentially selling off assets, or avoiding new investments due to price uncertainty. A score of 44, while not “extreme fear,” still highlights a prevailing sense of caution. This sentiment can sometimes present unique opportunities for those who are prepared to act contrary to the crowd, remembering the old adage: “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated for Accuracy? The strength of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index lies in its multi-faceted approach to measuring market sentiment. It doesn’t rely on a single data point but rather aggregates several key factors, each weighted to provide a comprehensive overview. This robust methodology aims to present a balanced perspective, minimizing bias from any one source. Here’s a breakdown of its components: Volatility (25%): This measures the current price fluctuations of Bitcoin compared to its average levels over the last 30 and 90 days. Higher volatility often signals fear. Trading Volume (25%): High trading volumes in a negative market can indicate strong selling pressure, suggesting fear. Conversely, high volume with rising prices can signal greed. Social Media Mentions (15%): An analysis of cryptocurrency-related hashtags and posts across various social media platforms. High engagement and negative sentiment can push the index towards fear. Surveys (15%): Polling investors directly provides a qualitative insight into their current market outlook. This component helps capture direct sentiment. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): An increase in Bitcoin’s market capitalization dominance often indicates investors are moving away from altcoins into the perceived safety of Bitcoin, a sign of fear in the broader altcoin market. Google Search Volume (10%): Tracking search queries related to cryptocurrencies, particularly those indicating market trends or price predictions, offers a glimpse into retail investor interest and potential panic or excitement. Navigating Crypto Markets with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Understanding the current reading of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index can be a powerful tool for investors, but it’s important to use it wisely. While it doesn’t offer direct buy or sell signals, it provides context. For instance, prolonged periods of “extreme fear” (scores below 20) have historically coincided with market bottoms, potentially indicating good entry points for long-term investors. Conversely, “extreme greed” (scores above 75) might suggest a market correction is on the horizon. However, relying solely on this index would be a mistake. It should always be used in conjunction with fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and a clear understanding of your own risk tolerance. The index serves best as a complementary indicator, helping you to assess the emotional temperature of the market and perhaps counter your own inherent biases. Understanding the Psychology Behind the Crypto Fear & Greed Index The human elements of fear and greed are deeply ingrained in financial markets, and the Crypto Fear & Greed Index beautifully illustrates this. Fear often leads to panic selling, causing prices to drop further, while greed can drive irrational exuberance, pushing asset values beyond sustainable levels. These emotions create cycles that are evident in market behavior. When fear dominates, investors tend to make decisions based on emotion rather than logic, often selling at a loss to avoid further pain. Conversely, during periods of greed, the fear of missing out (FOMO) can lead to speculative buying, often by those who are new to the market or less experienced. Recognizing these emotional patterns, both in yourself and in the broader market, is a significant step towards becoming a more disciplined and successful investor. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index remains a vital barometer for understanding the collective psyche of the crypto market. Its current reading of 44, signaling persistent fear, serves as a reminder that caution still prevails. By understanding its components and how to interpret its signals, investors can gain valuable insights, helping them to make more informed and less emotionally driven decisions in the often-turbulent world of cryptocurrencies. Stay informed, stay rational, and let data guide your path. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a tool that measures the current sentiment of the cryptocurrency market. It ranges from 0 (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme greed), indicating whether investors are feeling fearful or optimistic. How is “fear” different from “extreme fear” on the index? “Fear” (typically 25-49) suggests general caution and uncertainty among investors. “Extreme Fear” (0-24) indicates widespread panic, significant selling pressure, and a strong belief that prices will fall further. Can the Crypto Fear & Greed Index predict market bottoms or tops? While the index can offer strong indications, it is not a direct predictive tool. Historically, extreme fear has often coincided with market bottoms, and extreme greed with market tops, but it should be used with other analytical methods. What factors influence the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The index is influenced by six key factors: volatility, trading volume, social media mentions, investor surveys, Bitcoin’s market capitalization dominance, and Google search volume. Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index only for Bitcoin? While Bitcoin’s data plays a significant role due to its market dominance, the index is designed to reflect the overall sentiment of the broader cryptocurrency market, not just Bitcoin specifically.

A recent landmark decision by a South Korean court has provided crucial insight into the distinct challenges involved in DEX CEX listing . This ruling formally recognizes the significant difference in difficulty between getting a token listed on a decentralized exchange (DEX) versus a centralized exchange (CEX), a distinction that could profoundly impact how projects approach their market entry and contractual agreements. Why is DEX CEX Listing So Different? Understanding the Core Divide Understanding the court’s perspective requires a closer look at the fundamental operational models of these two primary types of cryptocurrency exchanges. The South Korean court’s ruling underscores that the process for a DEX CEX listing varies dramatically, primarily due to their underlying structures and regulatory environments. On one hand, centralized exchanges (CEXs) act as gatekeepers in the crypto world. They operate with strict regulatory compliance, extensive due diligence, and often demand a lengthy, rigorous review process for any token seeking a listing. This comprehensive evaluation typically includes assessing the project’s legitimacy, its technological innovation, the credibility of its development team, market potential, and adherence to various legal frameworks. Conversely, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) function on a permissionless model. This means that virtually anyone can initiate trading for a token by simply creating a smart contract and establishing a liquidity pool. This design inherently removes the need for a central authority’s approval, making the barrier to entry significantly lower and the process far more accessible for new tokens. The Seoul Court’s Definitive Stance on DEX CEX Listing Requirements The specific case that brought this crucial distinction to light involved a dispute over a performance bonus tied to a cryptocurrency listing contract. A plaintiff argued that listing a carbon credit-linked token on a DEX fulfilled a contractual requirement for an “overseas exchange” listing. They sought a substantial payment of six million tokens, firmly believing their actions had met the agreement’s terms. However, the 33rd Civil Affairs Division of the Seoul Central District Court, on September 4th, rendered a definitive verdict that challenged this interpretation. The court decisively rejected the plaintiff’s claim. It explicitly emphasized that the ease of creating a smart contract and establishing a liquidity pool on a DEX cannot be equated with the stringent, multi-faceted review process required by a CEX. This landmark ruling sets a clear precedent for how “exchange listing” might be interpreted in future contractual agreements, especially concerning DEX CEX listing conditions and their associated rewards. What Are the Far-Reaching Implications for Crypto Projects and Contracts? This South Korean court ruling carries significant weight for cryptocurrency projects, developers, and investors, not just locally but across the global blockchain ecosystem. It underscores the critical importance of clear, precise language in any contracts related to token listings and performance metrics. Key takeaways and actionable insights for the industry include: Enhanced Contractual Clarity: Future agreements should explicitly define whether a “listing” refers specifically to a CEX, a DEX, or encompasses both. Ambiguity, as seen in this case, can lead to costly and time-consuming legal disputes. Strategic Listing Planning: Projects aiming for broader market adoption and perceived legitimacy might still prioritize CEX listings, despite their higher barrier to entry. However, DEX listings remain an invaluable initial step for establishing early liquidity and community engagement. Refined Investor Perception: Investors and institutional players are likely to view CEX listings as a stronger validation of a project’s credibility, stability, and long-term viability, given the rigorous vetting process involved. This could influence investment decisions and project valuations. Regulatory Scrutiny: The ruling highlights the increasing legal and regulatory scrutiny on the crypto space, pushing for more defined terms and responsibilities for all participants. Ultimately, the ruling provides a robust legal framework that distinctly separates the two types of listings, impacting how performance bonuses, equity releases, and other contractual obligations tied to DEX CEX listing are viewed and enforced. Navigating the Future of DEX CEX Listing: A New Standard? The Seoul Central District Court’s decision is more than just a verdict in a single case; it represents a foundational clarification for the entire crypto ecosystem. By formally acknowledging the vast disparity in difficulty for DEX CEX listing , the court has provided much-needed legal precedent that the industry must heed. This ruling encourages greater precision and accountability in legal and business dealings within the blockchain space. It serves as a powerful reminder that while decentralization offers incredible accessibility and innovation, the path to mainstream acceptance often involves navigating the more stringent requirements of traditional financial gateways. Cryptocurrency projects and stakeholders must now carefully consider these distinctions when drafting contracts, setting development milestones, and strategizing their market presence. This decision sets a new standard for understanding the value and effort associated with different types of exchange listings. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the main difference between a DEX and a CEX, according to the court’s ruling? A1: The court ruled that CEXs require a rigorous review process for token listings, involving extensive due diligence and compliance. In contrast, DEXs allow anyone to easily initiate trading by creating a smart contract and liquidity pool, making the listing process significantly simpler and permissionless. Q2: Why did the South Korean court rule that DEX listings are easier? A2: The court’s reasoning was based on the operational models. CEXs have central authorities that vet projects, while DEXs are decentralized, allowing anyone to list tokens without approval, simply by setting up the necessary smart contracts and liquidity. Q3: How does this ruling impact cryptocurrency project contracts? A3: This ruling emphasizes the need for extreme clarity in contracts. Agreements involving token listings should explicitly state whether a “listing” refers to a CEX, a DEX, or both, to avoid future legal disputes over performance bonuses or other obligations. Q4: Does a DEX listing provide the same benefits as a CEX listing? A4: While DEX listings offer accessibility and early liquidity, CEX listings often provide broader market reach, increased investor trust due to rigorous vetting, and perceived legitimacy. The court’s ruling suggests they are not equivalent in terms of the effort and validation they represent. Q5: Is it always better to list on a CEX than a DEX? A5: Not necessarily. The “better” option depends on a project’s goals. DEXs are excellent for early-stage projects seeking immediate liquidity and community engagement. CEXs are often preferred for projects aiming for mainstream adoption, institutional investment, and higher visibility, despite the more challenging DEX CEX listing process.

Recently, there’s been chatter about the fate of altcoin season , especially after CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index showed a significant drop. But what if we told you that, according to expert analysis, altcoin season might not be over at all? Understanding the Enduring Altcoin Season It’s natural to feel a bit of uncertainty when market indicators dip. However, a closer look at underlying trends often reveals a different story. Noted macroeconomist and trader Henrik Zeberg has offered a compelling perspective that challenges the notion of a concluded altcoin season . Zeberg points to the OTHER/BTC chart as a crucial indicator. This chart essentially compares the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies, excluding Bitcoin, against Bitcoin’s own market cap. It’s a powerful tool for gauging the relative strength of altcoins versus Bitcoin. His analysis highlights that the OTHER/BTC chart has successfully broken through a key resistance level. This technical breakout is often interpreted as a bullish signal, suggesting a potential shift in market dynamics in favor of altcoins. For many traders, this move indicates that the momentum for altcoins is still very much alive. Why Analysts Believe Altcoin Season Persists The breaking of the 0.14 resistance level on the OTHER/BTC chart is a significant development. According to Zeberg, this technical pattern suggests that the current altcoin season is far from over. In fact, he suggests that if this level holds and momentum continues, we could see the OTHER/BTC ratio climb substantially, potentially reaching as high as 0.66. This kind of surge would represent a massive outperformance of altcoins compared to Bitcoin, a hallmark of a true altcoin season . It’s a scenario where investors might see substantial gains across a broad spectrum of alternative cryptocurrencies. Technical Breakout: The OTHER/BTC chart’s move above a critical resistance level is a strong bullish indicator. Market Cap Shift: This suggests altcoins are gaining strength relative to Bitcoin. Potential for Growth: Analysts foresee significant upside if current trends continue. Such an outlook provides a beacon of hope for those who might have been discouraged by recent index declines. It underscores the importance of looking beyond surface-level indicators and delving into deeper technical analysis. What Does This Mean for Your Crypto Portfolio During Altcoin Season? Understanding these dynamics can be incredibly beneficial for your investment strategy. A sustained altcoin season means opportunities might be abundant beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, it’s crucial to approach these opportunities with careful consideration. While the overall trend may be bullish for altcoins, individual projects will always carry their own risks and rewards. Diversification and thorough research remain paramount. Don’t just chase the hype; understand the technology, team, and market potential of any altcoin you consider investing in. Navigating Volatility and Maximizing Opportunities The crypto market is known for its volatility, and altcoin season is no exception. Price swings can be dramatic, offering both significant upside and potential downside. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on key technical charts like OTHER/BTC, not just general sentiment. Research Diligently: Understand the fundamentals of specific altcoins before investing. Manage Risk: Never invest more than you can afford to lose, and consider setting stop-loss orders. Consider Diversification: Spread your investments across different altcoins and sectors to mitigate risk. The potential for altcoins to outperform Bitcoin during such periods can be substantial. For those who position themselves wisely, this could lead to significant portfolio growth. It’s about being prepared and making informed decisions rather than reacting to every market fluctuation. The Bottom Line: Is Altcoin Season Truly Valid? Despite what a single index might suggest, the broader technical analysis indicates that the altcoin season remains a valid and active market phenomenon. Expert opinions, like that of Henrik Zeberg, provide a compelling counter-narrative to the idea that the altcoin rally is over. The breakout on the OTHER/BTC chart offers a strong technical foundation for continued altcoin strength. While market conditions can change rapidly, the current analysis suggests that there’s still plenty of potential for altcoins to shine. Keep your eyes on the charts, stay informed, and remember that patience and strategic planning are key in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency. This period could be an exciting time for investors willing to look beyond the headlines and delve into the technical details that often drive market movements. The narrative of a resilient altcoin season continues to unfold. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is an altcoin season? An altcoin season is a period when cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin (altcoins) significantly outperform Bitcoin in terms of price growth and market capitalization. Investors often look for signs of an altcoin season to potentially maximize returns. How is the CoinMarketCap Altcoin Season Index calculated? The CoinMarketCap Altcoin Season Index typically measures how many of the top 50 altcoins (excluding stablecoins) have outperformed Bitcoin over a specific period, often 90 days. If a significant majority (e.g., 75%) have outperformed, it indicates an altcoin season. Why might an index drop while altcoin season is still valid? An index might drop for several reasons, even if the underlying trend is bullish for altcoins. This could include temporary Bitcoin dominance spikes, specific large-cap altcoins underperforming, or the index’s calculation methodology not fully capturing broader market sentiment or technical breakouts like the OTHER/BTC chart. What is the OTHER/BTC chart? The OTHER/BTC chart compares the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies excluding Bitcoin to the market capitalization of Bitcoin. It’s a crucial indicator for understanding the relative strength and performance of altcoins versus Bitcoin. What are some key indicators to watch for altcoin season? Besides the OTHER/BTC chart, key indicators include Bitcoin dominance (a lower dominance often favors altcoins), individual altcoin performance against Bitcoin, trading volumes for altcoins, and overall market sentiment towards riskier assets. Is it safe to invest during altcoin season? While altcoin season presents opportunities for high returns, it also comes with increased volatility and risk. It’s essential to conduct thorough research, understand the risks associated with individual projects, diversify your portfolio, and only invest what you can afford to lose.

The Altcoin Season Index , a crucial gauge of market sentiment, has recently climbed four points, reaching a notable 68. This uptick suggests a shifting tide in the digital asset landscape, hinting that altcoins are gaining significant momentum against Bitcoin. For many, this rise in the Altcoin Season Index signals a potentially lucrative period for alternative cryptocurrencies. What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index , provided by CoinMarketCap, is a fascinating tool designed to measure the collective performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. However, it specifically excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens to give a clearer picture of speculative asset performance. It’s essentially a scoreboard comparing how these leading altcoins fare against Bitcoin over a 90-day period. Here’s how it works: The market enters an “altcoin season” when 75% of these top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin in the last three months. A reading closer to 100 indicates a robust and widespread altcoin season. Conversely, a lower reading, especially below 25, typically points towards a “Bitcoin season,” where Bitcoin dominates the market. Understanding this index helps investors gauge the prevailing market sentiment and make informed decisions about their portfolio allocations. A rising Altcoin Season Index suggests that the broader market is favoring altcoins. The Significance of an Altcoin Season Index at 68 The recent jump of the Altcoin Season Index to 68 is more than just a number; it reflects a tangible shift in investor interest and capital flow. Moving from 64 to 68 in a single day is a strong indicator that a substantial portion of the top altcoins are currently outperforming Bitcoin. This development often sparks optimism among altcoin enthusiasts and investors. What does this mean for the market? Increased Opportunities: Many altcoins could see significant price appreciation. Diversification Potential: Investors might find new avenues beyond Bitcoin for portfolio growth. Shifting Dominance: While Bitcoin often leads the charge, an Altcoin Season Index at 68 suggests altcoins are now taking the spotlight. However, it’s crucial to remember that 68 is still below the 75 threshold required for an official “altcoin season.” This means we are in a strong pre-season phase, with considerable momentum building, but not yet a full-blown altcoin dominance. Navigating the Dynamics of Altcoin Season As the Altcoin Season Index climbs, market participants often look for strategies to capitalize on the trend. This period can offer exciting prospects, but it also comes with its unique set of challenges and risks. Prudent navigation is key to maximizing potential gains while mitigating downsides. Consider these actionable insights: Research Diligently: Focus on altcoins with strong fundamentals, active development, and clear use cases. Avoid purely speculative plays. Manage Risk: Altcoins can be highly volatile. Only invest what you can afford to lose and consider setting stop-loss orders. Diversify Smartly: Instead of putting all your eggs in one altcoin basket, spread your investments across several promising projects. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on market news, project updates, and, of course, the Altcoin Season Index itself. The challenges include increased volatility, the risk of “pump and dump” schemes, and the sheer number of altcoins making it difficult to choose winners. Therefore, a well-thought-out strategy is indispensable. What Does the Rising Altcoin Season Index Mean for You? Whether you are a seasoned crypto investor or just starting, the current trajectory of the Altcoin Season Index presents an interesting scenario. It signifies a potential shift in market dynamics, where a broader range of digital assets might offer attractive returns. This doesn’t mean Bitcoin is out of the picture; rather, it indicates a broadening of the market’s focus. For individual investors, this could be a time to: Re-evaluate existing portfolios to identify underperforming assets or new opportunities. Explore emerging sectors within the altcoin space, such as DeFi, NFTs, or Layer 2 solutions. Educate yourself further on the projects that are driving this altcoin momentum. The market is always evolving, and the rise of the Altcoin Season Index to 68 is a clear signal that altcoins are demanding attention. Staying alert and adaptable will be crucial. In conclusion, the climb of the Altcoin Season Index to 68 is a significant development in the cryptocurrency market. It underscores a growing bullish sentiment towards altcoins, indicating that many are currently outperforming Bitcoin. While not yet an official “altcoin season,” this strong momentum suggests a vibrant period for alternative cryptocurrencies. As always, thorough research and a disciplined approach are vital for navigating these dynamic market conditions successfully. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the Altcoin Season Index?

Its exceptionally fast transaction rate as well as its growing base of holders have seen it become a top coin in the altcoin market. In the meantime, there’s also stronger buzz swelling up for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a sub-$1 DeFi token that’s gaining traction fast. Mutuum Finance is available for $0.035 during presale stage 6. The protocol has achieved over $16.2 million in funds raised from over 16,500 holders. Founded on a solid borrowing and lending protocol with high utility, MUTM is being seen by early movers as one of the few tokens poised for exponential growth and thus a likely outperformer even as Solana looks to new highs. Solana Heads toward $300 via Resistance Levels Solana (SOL) now trades at $234.55, holding above key support in the $220-$230 region while resistance is near $250-$260. Its ecosystem remains strong, as developer attention, network usage, and staking demand continue to power its momentum. If bulls can overcome present resistance using volume, $300 is a feasible target, but macro conditions and liquidity will be needed. Relative to this, investors prefer newer DeFi protocol Mutuum Finance for greater upside potential in 2025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Progress Mutuum Finance is in stage six of presale at $0.035 after a 16.17% price action from the previous stage. The project is enjoying enormous demand within the market with over 16,500 investors and over $16.2 million in capital. Mutuum Finance has recently launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program for the security of the platform. The bugs are categorized into four levels with critical, major, minor, and low tags. Mutuum Finance imposes tight controls over what is collateralized to preserve protocol and user security at all times. Target collateral ratios, lending limits, and deposit limits are encapsulated. Off close undercollateralized positions are generated to facilitate accommodation of acquisition of liquidated, call penalties and initiation of liquidation ensure remediation within a reasonable time frame in aiding systemic stability to be achieved. Collateral efficiency is maximized in collateralized securities, i.e., lending efficiency is maximized in Loan-to-Value (LTV) in over-collateralized credit. Reserve requirements are suggested as a shock-absorption mechanism for rare market conditions, and excess reserve can be imposed on risky assets for risk reduction. Mutuum Finance aims to overhaul the future DeFi model. In an attempt to make it simple to adopt, the project is conducting an early adoption campaign with a $100,000 giveaway whereby 10 members will receive $10,000 MUTM tokens. Mutuum Finance variable rate of interest is liquidity-driven. Borrowing at low cost when the system is well-capitalized allows for increased utilization, and borrowing at high cost when the system is illiquid allows loan repayment and fresh deposits. The Bigger Bull Run Play Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is stealing attention from Solana (SOL) as it gains traction swiftly under $1. Stage 6 presale tokens are priced at $0.035, going up to $0.04 in Stage 7. Already, the project has been funded with $16.2M from 16,500+ owners, a sign of demand and belief in its long-term dream. With a $50K CertiK bug bounty, a $100K giveaway, and strict risk controls, MUTM combines utility, scalability, and security in its dual lending model. While Solana is seeking to capture $300, MUTM’s upside potential appears much greater. Invest in Stage 6 tokens now before the price hike.

Have you ever wondered why, despite technological advancements, significant financial losses continue to plague the industry? Ronghui Gu, co-founder of leading blockchain security firm CertiK, recently shed light on a surprising truth that challenges common perceptions about where projects are truly failing. What’s Truly Behind Crypto’s Major Financial Losses? During an insightful roundtable at KBW 2025, Gu clarified that the industry frequently misunderstands the root causes of major financial losses. Many assume smart contract vulnerabilities are solely to blame, but the reality is more complex. Last year, an estimated $1.4 billion in damages was recorded. Gu emphasized these losses weren’t exclusively due to technical flaws. Human factors, like negligence or phishing, also played a significant role. No program is ever perfectly secure. This fundamental understanding drives CertiK’s approach, which employs a multi-layered defense system. This includes rigorous code reviews, comprehensive security audits, and continuous, real-time monitoring. This holistic strategy aims to cover all potential weak points, acknowledging that threats constantly evolve. The Alarming Disparity: Marketing vs. Crypto Security Spending Perhaps Gu’s most striking revelation was the stark difference in how projects allocate their budgets. He highlighted that most projects dedicate substantially larger budgets to marketing than to essential crypto security measures. This imbalance creates a dangerous vulnerability: Marketing focuses on growth: It’s about visibility, hype, and attracting new investors. Security focuses on protection: It’s about safeguarding assets, maintaining trust, and ensuring long-term viability. Gu firmly believes technical tools alone are insufficient for robust security. Raising awareness among developers, project teams, and investors is equally important. When projects prioritize outward appearance and rapid expansion over fundamental protection, they expose themselves and their users to unnecessary risks. Boosting Your Project’s Crypto Security: Lessons from Industry Leaders So, how can we shift this paradigm and strengthen crypto security ? Gu urged more projects to learn from successful industry examples. Projects like WEMIX and Klaytn have demonstrated proactive commitment by significantly increasing their security budgets. This strategic investment is not just an expense; it’s a critical foundation for sustainable growth and user trust. Here are key takeaways for projects aiming to enhance their security posture: Reallocate Budgets: Reconsider the balance between marketing and security. Secure projects build trust. Embrace Multi-Layered Defense: Go beyond a single audit. Think continuous monitoring and internal protocols. Prioritize Education: Invest in team training and educate your community. Human error is a major attack vector. Seek Expert Guidance: Partner with reputable security firms like CertiK. Ultimately, a strong focus on crypto security isn’t just about preventing losses; it’s about building a resilient, trustworthy ecosystem that can thrive. Summary: Investing in Security is Investing in the Future Ronghui Gu’s insights from CertiK serve as a powerful wake-up call. The misconception that all financial losses stem solely from smart contract vulnerabilities needs correction. More importantly, the alarming trend of prioritizing marketing over fundamental crypto security must be reversed. Projects emulating leaders like WEMIX and Klaytn by dedicating sufficient resources to security will protect assets, users, and foster greater confidence for sustainable, long-term success in decentralized finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What did CertiK co-founder Ronghui Gu highlight? A1: Gu clarified that crypto losses involve human factors, not just smart contract flaws, and projects often prioritize marketing over security. Q2: Why aren’t technical tools enough for crypto security? A2: Human factors contribute significantly to breaches. Awareness and education for developers, projects, and investors are crucial for comprehensive protection. Q3: Which projects exemplify increased security budgets? A3: WEMIX and Klaytn were cited for proactively increasing their security budgets, setting a positive industry precedent. Q4: What is CertiK’s approach to smart contract security? A4: CertiK uses a multi-layered defense: code reviews, security audits, and continuous monitoring, addressing both technical and human-related risks. Q5: What are key actions for projects to improve security? A5: Projects should reallocate budgets, implement multi-layered defenses, prioritize education, and seek expert guidance from security firms.

Bitcoin NPC Back In Positive Territory According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Crazzyblockk, the NPC of Bitcoin holders who have held the digital asset for less than one month has decisively flipped into positive territory. This change shows that new demand is flowing into the market at an accelerated rate. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Supply Ratio Declines After Fed Cut, Setting Stage For $120,000 Test Crazzyblockk highlighted that the 30-day change in supply held by wallets younger than one month has surged, hitting as high as +73,702 BTC on September 23. The following chart confirms the uptick following a period of negative action. It is worth emphasizing that the influx of fresh capital into the Bitcoin market is beneficial in helping to absorb the supply being sold by long-term holders (LTH). Typically, LTH refers to holders who have held BTC for more than six months. Currently, these LTH are selling their BTC at a rate of approximately -145,000 BTC, indicative of a typical bull market where early investors realize profits. The analyst added that the fact that selling pressure is being met with strong demand from new entrants is a sign of the rally’s sustainability. The CryptoQuant contributor added that the accumulation is not limited to the newest cohort. Besides the less than one-month cohort, short-term holders (STH) – investors who have held BTC for less than six months – are also accumulating. The STH NPC has changed to +159,098 BTC, cementing the robust demand for the top cryptocurrency by market cap across a spectrum of investors based on their time in the market. Crazzyblockk added: The current dynamic – where profit-taking from long-term investors is being absorbed by a new and enthusiastic wave of buyers – is a classic characteristic of a strengthening bull market. The positive flip in the youngest holder cohort is a leading indicator of broadening market participation and suggests a strong conviction among new investors. This robust demand structure is highly supportive of continued price appreciation in the near to medium term. Some Areas Of Concern For BTC While the demand for BTC from young cohorts is encouraging, some concerns still linger about the digital asset’s near-term price action. For instance, BTC exchange inflows remain elevated, raising fears of greater selling pressure.

Bitcoin whales – wallets with significant BTC holdings – are noticeably absent from the current rally. That said, the digital asset’s fundamentals continue to strengthen as the Bitcoin network activity recently reached a new 2025 peak. At press time, BTC trades at $112,804, down 0.2% in the past 24 hours.

With large chunks of tokens locked in various channels and restricted from active circulation, the analyst argues that the market may be preparing for a serious supply shock . Analyst Claims XRP‘s Supply Is Running Thin A crypto market expert, identified as ‘24HRSCRYPTO’ on X social media, has raised concerns that many investors underestimate just how “little” XRP tokens are available for open trading. This limited number of tokens , coupled with growing institutional demand, is driving the narrative of a potential supply shock. According to the analyst, crypto payments platform Ripple Labs currently holds 37.3 billion coins in escrow, accounting for 37.3% of the total market’s supply. An additional 3.5 billion XRP remains liquid under the control of the crypto company, representing roughly 3.5% of the supply. Co-founders Chris Larsen and Arthur Biritto also hold sizable portions, with Larsen owning 2.3 billion tokens (2.3%) and Britto holding 1.3 billion (1.3%). Taken together, these allocations mean that nearly 44.4% of the entire market supply is already locked up and accounted for before factoring in broader institutional activity. 24HRSCRYPTO has noted that institutional interest in the altcoin is steadily rising, further tightening the market. Canada’s Purpose Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) already hold 29.6 million XRP, valued at around $89 million at an average price of $3 per token. Similarly, 3iQ, another Canadian asset manager, controls 45 million XRP, worth approximately $137 million for $3. Despite these digital asset firms being relatively small players compared to trillion-dollar Wall Street institutions , their holdings already represent a meaningful portion of the available supply. According to the analysis, retail investors also control approximately 15% of the total coins in circulation. 24HRSCRYPTO’s present concern lies in when large US banking giants, such as JP Morgan , Wells Fargo, or Goldman Sachs, eventually move into XRP markets. According to him, if these institutions begin accumulating , billions of coins could quickly be locked away in cold storage, potentially drying up liquidity for traders and further eroding the already limited supply. Bullish Flag Pattern Signals Rebound To $4.3 Technical analysts are also weighing in on XRP’s price outlook , pointing to chart structures that support a potential bull rally. Captain Redbeard, a crypto expert active on X, noted that the altcoin is flashing strong bullish signals, particularly as institutional inflows from ETFs accelerate. He stated that the recently launched REX-Osprey XRPR Fund has added over $10 million in new assets, underscoring the rapid influx of capital into XRP-linked products. Examining his chart, the analyst noted that XRP has broken out of a consolidation wedge after a sharp rally, with the price hovering near $3.40. This consolidation has formed a classic bullish flag pattern , a setup that often precedes a breakout to the upside. Building on this momentum, Captain Redbeard predicts that a measured target from the bullish flag formation points toward $4.3, marking a significant rebound from current levels.",XRP|24HRSCRYPTO|Arthur Biritto|Canada’s Purpose Exchange Traded Funds|Captain Redbeard|Chris Larsen|ETFs|goldman sachs|JP Morgan|REX-Osprey XRPR Fund|ripple|ripple labs|wall street|Wells Fargo|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-24 01:00:56

Hunter Horsley, CEO of spot Bitcoin ETF issuer Bitwise, recently shared a groundbreaking development: an asset management firm overseeing a staggering $20 billion in assets has officially approved a 3% portfolio Bitcoin allocation . This isn’t just a number; it’s a powerful endorsement from mainstream finance, hinting at an accelerating journey towards mass adoption. What Does This Significant Bitcoin Allocation Mean for Investors? This decision by a $20 billion asset manager represents a monumental leap for Bitcoin allocation within traditional investment portfolios. It demonstrates a growing confidence among large financial institutions in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. For years, skeptics questioned Bitcoin’s legitimacy, but now, a significant player is putting real capital behind it. This move suggests that professional investors are increasingly seeing Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but as a legitimate component for diversification and potential growth. Validation: It validates Bitcoin as a serious investment asset. Precedent: It sets a powerful precedent for other large firms. Mainstream Acceptance: It pushes Bitcoin further into the mainstream financial dialogue. Hunter Horsley’s insights further emphasize this trend. He noted that interest from mainstream investors is stronger than ever. This sentiment aligns with broader market observations, indicating that the floodgates for institutional capital could be opening wider than ever before. Why Are Institutions Embracing Bitcoin Allocation Now? Several factors contribute to this pivotal moment for Bitcoin allocation . The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. has been a game-changer, providing a regulated and accessible pathway for institutional investors to gain exposure. This regulatory clarity reduces barriers and offers a familiar investment vehicle, making the decision to allocate capital to Bitcoin much simpler for compliance-conscious firms. Moreover, the narrative around Bitcoin has matured. It is increasingly viewed as a potential hedge against inflation and a form of ‘digital gold’ in an uncertain economic landscape. Horsley himself predicts that 2025 will mark the beginning of Bitcoin’s mass adoption, a forecast rooted in the current trajectory of institutional interest and product availability. Benefits of institutional Bitcoin allocation include: Portfolio Diversification: Bitcoin often exhibits low correlation with traditional assets. Growth Potential: Continued adoption could drive significant appreciation. Inflation Hedge: A perceived store of value in inflationary environments. Navigating the Future: Challenges and Opportunities in Bitcoin Allocation While the future for Bitcoin allocation looks bright, it’s essential to acknowledge that challenges remain. Bitcoin’s price volatility, while a source of opportunity, can also be a significant risk factor for traditional portfolios. Regulatory landscapes are still evolving globally, which can introduce uncertainties. However, these challenges are often viewed as part of the asset’s early growth phase. For investors, this development offers actionable insights. It suggests that a prudent, long-term approach to Bitcoin could be beneficial. Institutions are not typically chasing short-term gains but are making strategic decisions based on fundamental shifts. This news serves as a strong signal for both institutional and sophisticated retail investors to consider how digital assets might fit into their broader investment strategies. This move by a $20 billion asset manager is not an isolated event but a bellwether for what’s to come. We can expect more firms to explore and eventually commit to similar Bitcoin allocation strategies as the digital asset ecosystem continues to mature and integrate with traditional finance. In conclusion, the approval of a 3% Bitcoin allocation by a $20 billion asset manager is a watershed moment for the cryptocurrency industry. It underscores Bitcoin’s growing legitimacy and its increasing role within mainstream investment portfolios. With industry leaders like Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley predicting mass adoption by 2025, the journey of Bitcoin from a niche asset to a globally recognized investment class is clearly accelerating. This institutional embrace paves the way for a more integrated and dynamic financial future, making Bitcoin a topic of central importance for any forward-thinking investor.

Giorgetti made these remarks as the Italian government is exploring alternatives to fund billions of euros in taxes for the 2026 budget, which is expected to go public next month. During a political rally in central Marche, the Economy Minister stated that all individuals in Italy should contribute fairly without pressure. To achieve a common ground, Giorgetti suggested they discuss this together so that all parties can help. According to him, this is very important. In late 2024, a set of measures introduced by the government brought in about 4 billion euros ($4.72 billion) from banks to assist with this year’s budget. Sources mentioned that Giorgetti’s ruling League party wants banks to pitch in again with over 1 billion euros for the 2026 budget. Meanwhile, last year, the government introduced a series of measures enabling the agency to collect approximately 4 billion euros, or $4.72 billion, from banks to support the 2025 budget. Italian authorities urge the banking industry to contribute to support state finances Earlier, Italian lawmakers highlighted that the relevant authorities would hold discussions with local banks concerning their contribution to support state finances. This move has put great pressure on the banking industry, which is facing harsh criticism from Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni’s right-wing coalition. The critics expressed that banks have not established strategies to reward depositors or offer better loan terms for businesses. This is despite the industry recording significant profits resulting from high interest rates. Marco Osnato, an Italian politician and a member of the Brothers of Italy (FdI) party, led by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, weighed in on the topic of discussion. Osnato stated that considering a bank contribution is important when discussing the budget. These talks are part of an effort to create a budget and submit it to the cabinet for approval by mid-October. In 2024, Italy’s seven leading banks were expected to raise about 25 billion euros, or $29.27 billion in profits, according to reports from the FISAC CGIL union. These banks returned 21 billion euros to their investors and reduced their branch locations by 5%. In the meantime, as Italian banks face reduced interest rates, the industry has started implementing a round of mergers and consolidations. In August 2023, Rome, the Capital of Italy, contributed to the drastic decline in banking stock prices after it applied a surprising tax of 40% on the profits banks generated from higher interest rates. Considering this effect, the government decided to withdraw this decision and include an option for banks to opt out. This meant that the tax did not bring in any income. Italian officials explore suitable ways to generate funds from banks for the 2026 budget Earlier in September, Giancarlo Giorgetti met with leaders of his co-ruling League party to discuss suitable ways they could adopt to generate funds from banks to back the spending plans incorporated in the government’s 2026 budget. This came after a League statement pointed out that banks and other financial firms generating billions of euros in profits should contribute significantly to the state’s finances. According to the far-right League, this will substantially enable the government to support families and businesses. However, additional information on the situation was not provided. Meanwhile, Italy has stepped up its criticism of EU fiscal rules. As earlier reported by Cryptopolitan , the state describes them as “old and outdated,” arguing they are unfair at a time when countries feel compelled to spend more on defense. A few months ago, Italy’s economy minister, Giancarlo Giorgetti, called the bloc’s current budget system “stupid and senseless” and said it needed to be overhauled to give member states more leeway to boost military spending without fear of financial penalties. His remarks came during a eurozone finance ministers’ meeting in Luxembourg, where countries debated balancing budgets versus ramping up security investment while relaxing fiscal discipline.

This bold vision isn’t from a science fiction novel; it’s a serious prediction from none other than Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong. He recently shared his belief on X that Bitcoin $1M by 2030 is not just possible but probable, given its current progress and the need for a long-term perspective. This exciting forecast has naturally sent ripples through the cryptocurrency community, prompting many to consider the incredible potential trajectory of the world’s leading digital asset. What Fuels the Vision of Bitcoin $1M by 2030? Brian Armstrong’s prediction stems from a deep understanding of Bitcoin’s fundamentals and its historical performance. He emphasizes that looking at Bitcoin through a short-term lens misses the bigger picture. Over its existence, Bitcoin has demonstrated remarkable resilience and growth, consistently breaking through previous price ceilings. This long-term view is crucial when discussing ambitious targets like Bitcoin $1M by 2030 . One of the core drivers is Bitcoin’s inherent scarcity. Unlike traditional currencies that can be printed endlessly, Bitcoin has a fixed supply cap of 21 million coins. This hard limit, combined with increasing demand, creates a powerful economic dynamic. As more individuals, institutions, and even nations adopt Bitcoin, its value proposition strengthens, making such a high valuation seem less like a dream and more like a potential reality. Understanding Bitcoin’s Unique Growth Trajectory Bitcoin’s journey is punctuated by unique events known as “halvings.” Approximately every four years, the reward miners receive for validating transactions is cut in half. This mechanism further reduces the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market, historically leading to significant price appreciation. The most recent halving occurred in April 2024, and past cycles suggest that the impact of these events plays a vital role in Bitcoin’s long-term value accumulation. Moreover, increasing global access to digital assets through user-friendly platforms like Coinbase contributes significantly to its expanding user base. The growing interest from institutional investors is another undeniable force. The approval of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in the United States marked a pivotal moment, opening the floodgates for traditional finance to invest in Bitcoin more easily. This institutional capital inflow provides substantial liquidity and legitimacy, further paving the way for a future where Bitcoin $1M by 2030 could be a benchmark. Is Bitcoin $1M by 2030 Realistic? Examining Key Factors While Armstrong’s prediction is optimistic, it’s grounded in observable trends and economic principles. Let’s break down some of the key factors that could contribute to this monumental rise: Increasing Global Adoption: As more countries explore central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and people seek alternatives to traditional financial systems, Bitcoin’s role as a decentralized, borderless asset becomes more appealing. Inflationary Pressures: Persistent inflation in fiat currencies drives individuals and institutions to store wealth in assets with a limited supply, like Bitcoin, as a hedge. Technological Advancements: Continuous improvements in Bitcoin’s underlying technology, such as the Lightning Network for faster transactions, enhance its utility and scalability, making it more attractive for everyday use. Demographic Shift: Younger generations, who are more digitally native, are increasingly comfortable with cryptocurrencies, suggesting a long-term shift in investment preferences. These combined forces paint a compelling picture for Bitcoin’s future. However, it’s also important to consider potential challenges. Navigating the Roadblocks on the Path to Bitcoin $1M by 2030 Reaching a $1 million valuation for Bitcoin will not be without its hurdles. The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and significant price swings are a common occurrence. Regulatory uncertainty remains a concern in various jurisdictions, which could impact adoption and market sentiment. Furthermore, technological risks, such as potential security vulnerabilities or competition from emerging digital assets, always exist. Investors must approach such predictions with a balanced perspective. While the potential for Bitcoin $1M by 2030 is exciting, it’s crucial to understand the risks involved. Diversification and thorough research are always recommended before making any investment decisions. Armstrong himself emphasizes the need for a long-term view, suggesting that patience will be a key virtue for those hoping to witness this monumental achievement. What Does This Mean for You? Brian Armstrong’s forecast offers a glimpse into a potentially transformative future for finance. It underscores Bitcoin’s growing importance as a global store of value and a significant asset class. For those new to crypto, this prediction highlights the long-term potential of digital assets. For seasoned investors, it reinforces the conviction many already hold about Bitcoin’s enduring value. Ultimately, the journey to Bitcoin $1M by 2030 will likely be dynamic and challenging, but the underlying fundamentals and increasing mainstream acceptance provide a strong foundation for this ambitious goal. It’s a testament to the revolutionary power of decentralized finance and the digital age.

Frequently Asked Questions About Bitcoin’s Future Here are some common questions regarding Brian Armstrong’s bold prediction for Bitcoin: Who made the prediction about Bitcoin reaching $1 million by 2030? Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong stated his belief on X (formerly Twitter) that Bitcoin could reach $1 million by 2030. What are the main reasons cited for the Bitcoin $1M by 2030 prediction? Key reasons include Bitcoin’s fixed supply (scarcity), increasing global adoption by individuals and institutions, the impact of halving events, and its role as a hedge against inflation. Are there significant risks to Bitcoin reaching this price target? Yes, significant risks include market volatility, potential regulatory challenges, technological vulnerabilities, and competition from other cryptocurrencies. How does Bitcoin’s scarcity contribute to its potential value? With a fixed supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin’s scarcity means that as demand increases, its value tends to rise, assuming all other factors remain constant. What should investors consider in light of this prediction? Investors should consider a long-term perspective, conduct thorough research, understand the inherent risks of cryptocurrency, and avoid making investment decisions based solely on predictions.

Ian Calderon, a former Democratic California State Assemblyman, has officially thrown his hat into the ring for the 2026 gubernatorial election, bringing with him a truly modern vision. What makes his candidacy particularly compelling for many is his staunch support for Bitcoin, positioning him as a leading Ian Calderon Bitcoin advocate in mainstream politics. This isn’t just another election; it’s a potential turning point for how states view and integrate digital assets. Why is Ian Calderon Bitcoin’s Champion in California? Cointelegraph first reported Calderon’s official announcement, highlighting his progressive stance on technology and finance. Calderon, a seasoned politician with a track record in the State Assembly, is not shy about his belief that current political approaches are failing to keep pace with technological advancements. His campaign hinges on a clear message: it’s time for a change from politicians who use outdated methods to solve modern problems. On X, Calderon articulated his perspective, noting the pervasive use of smartphones for daily payments, Venmo for seamless money transfers, and Bitcoin for long-term savings by the current generation. He argues that government should reflect these realities, not lag behind. This isn’t just about adopting new tech; it’s about fundamentally rethinking how the state manages its finances and serves its citizens. The Bold Vision: Integrating Ian Calderon Bitcoin into State Operations Calderon’s proposals are ambitious and aim to revolutionize California’s financial infrastructure. He suggests two primary avenues for integrating Bitcoin: Incorporating Bitcoin into the State Government’s Portfolio: This move could diversify the state’s assets, potentially offering a hedge against inflation and opening up new investment opportunities. It signals a forward-thinking approach to treasury management. Introducing Bitcoin as a Payment Method for Some State Programs: Imagine paying for certain state services or taxes with Bitcoin. This could streamline transactions, reduce processing fees, and offer greater financial inclusion for those who prefer digital currencies. Such initiatives could position California at the forefront of digital asset adoption among U.S. states. The benefits could extend beyond mere financial efficiency, potentially attracting tech talent and fostering innovation within the state’s already robust technology sector. Furthermore, embracing Ian Calderon Bitcoin policies could enhance transparency in government transactions, a key advantage of blockchain technology. Navigating the Challenges: What Lies Ahead for Ian Calderon Bitcoin Adoption? While the vision is exciting, the path to integrating Bitcoin into state operations is not without its hurdles. Any significant shift in financial policy requires careful consideration of various factors: Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is still evolving at both federal and state levels. California would need to navigate these complexities, potentially setting new precedents. Public Perception and Education: A significant portion of the population may still be unfamiliar with Bitcoin or harbor misconceptions. Education and clear communication would be crucial for successful adoption. Market Volatility: Bitcoin’s price volatility is a common concern. Strategies would need to be in place to manage potential risks associated with holding a volatile asset in a state’s portfolio. Security and Infrastructure: Implementing secure systems for Bitcoin transactions and custody would be paramount to protect state assets and citizen data. Addressing these challenges would require collaboration with financial experts, technologists, and regulatory bodies. Calderon’s campaign would need to present robust plans for mitigating these risks, demonstrating a thorough understanding of both the opportunities and the complexities involved in such a transformative endeavor. His ability to articulate these solutions will be key to garnering widespread support for his Ian Calderon Bitcoin agenda. What Does This Mean for the Future of Ian Calderon Bitcoin in Politics? Calderon’s candidacy is more than just a local race; it represents a growing trend of cryptocurrency entering mainstream political discourse. As more politicians begin to understand and embrace digital assets, we could see a shift in how governments approach economic policy, financial inclusion, and technological innovation. His proposals could serve as a blueprint or a case study for other states considering similar moves. The debate around Ian Calderon Bitcoin policies will undoubtedly bring important conversations about the future of money, the role of technology in governance, and the evolving needs of a digitally native population. His campaign will test the waters for how ready the electorate is for such progressive financial policies, potentially paving the way for a new era of tech-savvy governance. Ian Calderon’s run for California governor marks a significant moment for the cryptocurrency community and the state’s political landscape. His pro-Bitcoin stance and innovative proposals for integrating digital assets into state government reflect a forward-thinking approach to modern challenges. While the journey will involve overcoming significant hurdles, his candidacy ignites an important dialogue about the future of finance and governance in California and beyond. It’s a bold step towards a more technologically integrated future, driven by the vision of a politician ready to embrace the digital age.

Despite an initial surge, shares of Fold tumbled shortly after the news. The Fold Bitcoin Credit Card allows customers to earn Bitcoin on everyday purchases, with rewards of up to 3.5% back and no category restrictions or deposit requirements. Users receive 2% back instantly on all spending, with an extra 1.5% when paying via a Fold Checking Account. Additionally, cardholders can unlock enhanced rewards of up to 10% when shopping with major partners such as Amazon, Target, Home Depot, Uber, Starbucks, and hundreds more. Shares of Fold (FLD) tumble despite strong card perks and partner discounts After closing at $3.88 on Monday, FLD opened at $4.69 on Tuesday. However, the buzz was short-lived, with the price reducing to $3.26 as of this writing, marking a more than 15% dip on the day. “Our credit card offers clear and compelling value and makes Bitcoin easily accessible to everyone,” said Fold founder, Chairman, and CEO Will Reeves, in a statement . “There are no categories to manage, no tokens to stake, no exchange account or balance requirements; just real Bitcoin, earned automatically with every purchase.” No timeline has been announced for the Fold credit card’s release. Stripe reported handling over $3.1 billion in transaction volume and distributed over $83 million in Bitcoin rewards. The firm also disclosed that it holds 1,485 BTC in its treasury, which is valued at approximately $167 million. Meanwhile, Fold’s stock price surged on Friday, nearly doubling to trade above $7 per share, fueled by speculation that longtime crypto investor Mike Alfred may be joining the company. Instead, Bakkt , another publicly traded crypto firm, named Mike Alfred to its advisory board on Monday, sending its stock sharply higher. As of Tuesday, Bakkt shares have climbed nearly 18% to $17.31. Fold’s stock (FLD), by contrast, slipped following the news and extended losses into Tuesday. Still, FLD remains about 8% higher over the past week, though it is down roughly 12% for the month. Fold says the card is part of a larger consumer suite that includes banking, custody/exchange, and debit. Stripe has been slowly extending out its crypto payments business this year, including working on Tempo, a payments-first blockchain that it incubated with Paradigm, and partnerships that brought acceptance of USDC to Shopify merchants alongside Coinbase. Visa, meanwhile, continues to support card programs that adopt rewards in digital assets and facilitate cryptocurrencies. The payments processor has now achieved approximately $1 billion in annualized stablecoin transaction volume, nearly quadrupling from earlier this year. Market sentiment turns bearish as Bitcoin struggles to break $125K Bitcoin is trading flat on the day at around $112,218, though it remains down about 3% over the past week. Myriad Markets users have recently turned bearish on the top cryptocurrency’s chances of rising to $125,000—which would be a new all-time high mark—sooner than it can fall to $105,000. As of this writing, over 50% of predictors expect it to hit the lower mark sooner than the higher price. That mark has grown substantially over the last week, rising from about 38% on September 16.

The firm is seeking between $15b and $20b through a private placement for about a 3% stake, Bloomberg reported Tuesday. The transaction would reportedly involve new equity, not secondary sales by existing backers. Cantor Fitzgerald is acting as lead adviser on the process. A valuation near half a trillion dollars would place Tether alongside companies such as OpenAI and SpaceX, an extraordinary mark for a lightly regulated crypto business, even as rivals expand and lower US interest rates threaten its windfall earnings. Circle, the closest public peer in stablecoins, was valued near $30b on Tuesday afternoon. CEO Paolo Ardoino confirmed via X that the company is evaluating a raise from a selected group of “high-profile key investors.” Tether is evaluating a raise from a selected group of high-profile key investors, to maximize the scale of the Company's strategy across all existing and new business lines (stablecoins, distribution ubiquity, AI, commodity trading, energy, communications, media) by several… — Paolo Ardoino (@paoloardoino) September 24, 2025 Tether Monetizes Reserves While Maintaining Market Lead In Dollar-Pegged Tokens Tether issues USDT , the largest dollar-pegged token, with a market value around $172b. USDC from Circle ranks second at about $74b. The company earns yield by parking reserves in cash like assets, including US Treasuries. Tether reported $4.9b in profit for the second quarter in July. Chief executive Paolo Ardoino has said profit margins are about 99%. These figures are not subject to the reporting standards required of public companies. Prospective investors have been granted data room access in recent weeks to assess the deal. Bloomberg reported the fundraising plans are expected to close by year end, depending on final terms and allocations. Data Room Opens As Investors Weigh Governance, Policy Risks And Growth Plan The fundraise comes as Tether lays groundwork to return to the US . The company has outlined a plan for a US-regulated stablecoin and appointed Bo Hines, a former White House crypto official, to lead the effort. Earlier this month, Tether announced USA₮ , a dollar backed token intended to strengthen the role of the US dollar in digital markets. The push follows a shift in the US policy climate, with the GENIUS Act expected to expand the role of stablecoins and potentially allow banks, card networks and technology firms to issue their own tokens. Tether has a history of run-ins with US regulators. In 2021, it paid a $41m fine to settle allegations that it misrepresented reserves. The firm had largely stayed out of the US before a recent change in tone toward crypto policy. A successful raise would give Tether deep capital to defend market share and invest across infrastructure, compliance and product. It would also test investor appetite for private crypto champions at a time when rates are easing and yield on reserves may moderate, a shift that could weigh on future earnings.

In a filing dated September 22, which was made at the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, the FTX Recovery Trust submitted a complaint against the crypto mining company Genesis Digital Assets (GDA), its associates, and two co-founders. According to the complaint, they were trying to recover $1.15 billion that was mixed up and improperly used. Additionally, the filing pointed out that these funds were connected to Bankman-Fried’s scam scandal against clients and other creditors at FTX in 2021 and 2022. Sam Bankman-Fried finds himself in trouble again with a scam scandal Concerning the FTX Recovery Trust’s complaint , Sam Bankman-Fried had ordered FTX’s sister cryptocurrency trading firm, Alameda Research, headed by CEO Caroline Ellison, to purchase GDA shares at very high prices exceeding $500 million for just 154 preferred shares. Apart from this, reliable sources also revealed that the CEO purchased shares of GDA for around $550.9 million after he directly sent money to Rashit Makhat and Marco Krohn, the Co-Founders at GDA. Following the situation, the filing highlighted that by 2021, Bankman-Fried had successfully transferred billions of dollars in customer funds from FTX.com exchange to Alameda. During this act, the CEO made Alameda spend more than $1.15 billion on expensive GDA shares despite escalating debt to FTX.com. On the other hand, the complaint highlighted that the transfers were purposefully meant to benefit Bankman-Fried personally. For the 90% owner of Alameda, his share of the act was nearly all the profits from GDA’s inflated value and potential success (for both GDA and Bitcoin). He was supposed to pass losses onto the FTX Group’s creditors and customers to achieve this. The FTX Recovery Trust aims to recover funds as a result of Bankman-Fried’s actions The lawsuit against Genesis Digital followed the FTX Recovery Trust’s efforts to regain funds connected to the collapse of the exchange. FTX filed for bankruptcy in 2022, and several former executives, such as Bankman-Fried, are currently in prison. Bankman-Fried’s imprisonment came after he ignored obvious warning signs and believed in lies while investing in Genesis Digital. At that time, the company in Kazakhstan experienced an energy crisis. It also offered Bankman-Fried false financial documents. In the meantime, a bankruptcy court approved a $175 million settlement in 2023 in which Genesis Global Trading — which has no relationship to GDA — agreed to pay FTX. After over two years in bankruptcy court, the FTX Recovery Trust began paying out creditors in February. The plan began with a $1.2 billion payout to claimants and another $5 billion distribution in May. It is due to release $1.6 billion to creditors on September 30. As earlier reported by Cryptopolitan in the first round, Julian Grigo, head of institutions and fintech at asset custody, said some creditors may have been unhappy. Reimbursements offered relief to some customers, he said, but concerns lingered because most holders stand to get only a fraction of their original assets — and those repayments are tied to the prices at the time of the exchange’s collapse. Bitcoin-related repayments have been of particular dispute, since they apply to November 2022 valuations, i.e., when BTC was trading at around $20,000. Its price has since skyrocketed to between $90,000 and $112,000.

The cryptocurrency recorded about 390% gains compared with the same period last year, and it has held the top spot for nine consecutive months, based on the figures released. Trading activity was heavy in August, with roughly 299 billion baht of crypto trades recorded — about $8 billion — and some 230,000 active accounts touching the market. XRP Tops Local Returns Market breakdowns show that retail traders made up a large share of the volume. Retail investors accounted for about 40% of August trading activity, while the rest came from institutions, foreign accounts and corporate entities. The data, which has been repeated across a number of outlets, points to broad participation by ordinary traders in Thailand rather than a single big player driving prices. Big Volume, Big Questions While the headline numbers are eye catching, analysts say simple comparisons have limits. Price return is only one way to measure performance. Stocks and gold are often judged on total return, which can include dividends and other income. Crypto returns can swing wildly over short stretches, especially when base prices a year earlier were low. That makes any year-on-year figure sensitive to timing and market cycles. Regulatory Context And Usage Based on reports from the regulator and market observers, cryptocurrencies in Thailand are mainly held for investment rather than daily payments. Crypto is not generally permitted as a standard means of payment, though limited pilot programs have been tried for specific uses. This mix of strong speculation and limited everyday use helps explain why price moves may be sharp even as broader adoption for commerce remains limited. Volatility And Data Reliability Some experts warn that the headline percentage masks risk. XRP’s rise may reflect a recovery from a depressed price level a year ago, along with intensified interest from retail buyers. Data quality and methodology also matter. Trade volumes and account counts are often reported by exchanges or consolidated by the regulator, and different sources can use different filters or definitions. Market Watchers Call For Caution Observers say greater attention from regulators is likely as crypto trading gains prominence. Reports suggest the surge could bring tighter rules aimed at investor protection.

The recent pullback in crypto markets, which pushed Bitcoin below $112,000, has also put pressure on Solana. Despite the bearish sentiment, bulls remain active around this key support. Related Reading: XRP Price Chatter Heats Up After Developer’s $4 Hint – Details Trading volumes have surged past $12 billion within 24 hours, indicating strong participation from both buyers and sellers. Analysts point out that a drop below $200 could trigger liquidity-driven volatility, but any decline might also serve as a springboard toward $250 in the near term. The daily chart shows SOL consolidating within an ascending channel, with RSI cooling to neutral territory. If the midline support around $210 holds, a retest of $250 remains a possibility. SOL's price trends lower on the daily chart. Source: SOLUSD chart on Tradingview Institutional Confidence and Treasury Growth While short-term volatility weighs on the Solana price, institutional adoption continues to strengthen its long-term outlook. Roughly 590,000 SOL, worth over $120 million, has been added to portfolios in the past month. Corporate staking commitments now exceed 8.27 million SOL, equating to more than $1.7 billion. This growing treasury activity is no accident. With staking yields averaging 7%–8%, Solana offers businesses a more lucrative reserve strategy than Bitcoin, which provides no yield, and Ethereum, which averages around 3%–4%. Nasdaq-listed firms like DeFi Development Corp. and Fragmetric Labs have even launched Solana-focused treasuries in South Korea, further strengthening the network’s appeal as a corporate asset. Adoption Beyond Solana Price Action Adoption cycles are increasingly positioning Solana as a competitor to Bitcoin and Ethereum. Payment giants like Stripe and PayPal are integrating Solana into their systems, reflecting confidence in its speed and low-cost efficiency. Forward Industries has taken a further step, announcing plans to tokenize its public equity directly on Solana’s blockchain, a move that signals the merging of traditional finance with decentralized technology. Despite lacking an exchange-traded fund (ETF), Solana’s fundamentals suggest strong upside potential. Analysts believe that if SOL closes above $250, the token could target $300 before year-end. With institutional portfolios still holding less than 1% of Solana’s supply, the room for growth remains significant.

A short-term dip may be inevitable, but with adoption accelerating and treasuries expanding, the long-term narrative suggests that Solana’s challenge to Bitcoin is only beginning.

Pump.Fun combines the core strengths of the creator economy and cryptocurrency trading. Through tokenizing content and an efficient buyback mechanism, it has attracted numerous young users. PUMP is the native token of the Pump.fun platform, with a total supply of 1 trillion, and features a range of practical functionalities. What Is PUMP PUMP initially started as a cryptocurrency platform with a focus on meme coin launches. After its launch last year, it quickly became popular in the market, sweeping the Solana ecosystem with its low-barrier issuance mechanism. However, it did not stay limited to a single meme coin tool but gradually transformed into a comprehensive social finance platform. It allows users to trade and invest in various forms of content, including short videos, live streams, YouTube videos, and tweets. The platform’s vision is to break the traditional issuance model in the crypto industry and deeply integrate the creator economy and financial transactions, thus attracting more young users, especially Gen Z aged 16-24, into the crypto world. PUMP’s Underlying Technologies and Advantages PUMP’s core technology is based on content tokenization and a socially-driven trading mechanism. The platform allows users to convert any content (e.g., live streams or short videos) into tradable tokens. Users can participate in the ecosystem by investing in, sharing, and discussing these tokens. Unlike the traditional push-based model, PUMP emphasizes network effects: the rise of token prices is based on social interactions and viral spread among users. Recently, PUMP introduced a creator fee mechanism, returning almost 100% of transaction fees (1%) to content creators, significantly enhancing the platform’s incentive efficiency. Additionally, the platform integrates direct messaging (DMS) and a mobile app to support seamless content sharing and interaction. Regarding capital operations, PUMP employs a high-percentage buyback mechanism, with almost 100% of its revenue used for repurchasing PUMP tokens, creating a deflationary effect that further strengthens the ecosystem’s stability. In the future, the platform plans to expand into stablecoin issuance and even explore L1 blockchain development to achieve broader application scenarios. PUMP’s product advantages lie in its creator economy model and user-friendly design. Compared to traditional platforms like TikTok or Twitch, PUMP offers creators revenue potential over 100 times higher. For example, a creator can earn $300 by streaming for just 8 minutes with 20 viewers. The low-barrier issuance mechanism and built-in liquidity ensure rapid onboarding and easy trading, attracting a massive user base. Additionally, the platform’s mobile-first strategy enhances its viral spread with the goal of reaching a billion users. The recently introduced creator reward mechanism has increased livestreaming by five times, proving the efficiency of its product iteration. Overall, PUMP not only supports the Solana ecosystem but also challenges the monopoly of existing platforms through innovations in social finance, despite facing content moderation and regulatory challenges. PUMP’s Token Mechanism PUMP is the native token of the Pump.Fun platform. It was launched in July 2025 by Initial Coin Offering (ICO) with a fixed total supply of 1,000,000,000,000 (one trillion) tokens. There is no mechanism for additional minting. Of the total: 33% allocated to the ICO; 24% reserved for community and ecosystem incentives; 13% allocated to early investors; 3% for livestreaming incentives; 2.6% for trading liquidity support; 2.4% for the ecosystem fund and 2% for the foundation. The main function of the PUMP token is to enhance the utility and incentive mechanism of the Pump.Fun ecosystem. Although it is not mandatory to use the PUMP token for basic platform operations, holders can benefit from it. The specific utilities include: Fee Rebates & Sharing: Transaction fees on the platform (mainly from PumpSwap trades with dynamic fee rates ranging between 0.05% and 0.95%) are used to repurchase PUMP tokens, creating an indirect cash-flow benefit. Token holders can receive rewards via mechanisms like hourly airdrops. Token Buybacks & Burn: Platform revenues are used to repurchase PUMP tokens, which are then burned to reduce circulating supply. This creates a deflationary pressure to support price appreciation. Community & Ecosystem Incentives: Token allocations are used for promotions, airdrops, developer support, and the ecosystem fund. Holders may participate in giveaway and growth activities. Livestreaming & Content-Function Benefits: Tokenized participation is supported. For example, buying tokens during livestreams on Twitch/YouTube or on Pump.Fun binds viewers to creators, enabling value conversion and aligned incentives. Ecosystem Access Rights: Holding PUMP grants holders additional access to platform ecosystems. Note: The total fees collected by the platform from token transactions = Creator Fee (dynamic and tiered, benefiting creators and indirect token holders) + Protocol Fee (fixed, used for repurchase/ burn). The former focuses on incentives (rewards sharing) while the latter focuses on value capture (deflation). Under the further improved “Project Ascend” (launched in September 2025), the creator fee is increased by 10 times, while the protocol fee remains unchanged. This ensures sufficient funds for token repurchase. Summary As an innovator in social finance starting from a meme-coin launchpad, PUMP has successfully evolved into a comprehensive content trading ecosystem. Its underlying technologies rest on tokenization and socially-driven mechanisms. Product advantages include high income potential for creators and mobile-friendly design, while the token model provides solid value support through efficient repurchase. Despite facing regulatory and content moderation risks, PUMP’s roadmap—including plans for stablecoin expansion and building a super-app—demonstrates its ambition to challenge mainstream platforms. For crypto enthusiasts and content creators, PUMP represents a new opportunity in the Web3 era and its evolution deserves close attention.

This crucial change comes as the pace of corporate crypto accumulation slows, redefining who is steering the market’s direction and highlighting a dynamic evolution in investor behavior. Why Are Spot ETFs Now Leading the Charge? According to Real Vision analyst Jamie Coutts, the current bull market initially found its footing through institutional investors and companies building robust digital asset treasuries (DAT). This corporate interest provided a strong foundation, but recent data indicates a slowdown in this particular segment of buying. As a result, Spot ETFs have confidently stepped back into the spotlight, becoming the undeniable focal point of market activity. Coutts observes that fund flows into these ETFs, which experienced a lull earlier this month, have recently turned decidedly bullish. This renewed vigor aligns perfectly with abundant global liquidity, creating an environment ripe for ETF growth. It is important to note that while Bitcoin currently exhibits sideways trading, a pattern often seen during periods of slower global liquidity, its underlying volatility patterns remain entirely normal. This suggests that the market’s foundational health is intact, even as leadership roles evolve. Understanding the Shift: Corporate Crypto vs. Spot ETFs The early phases of this bull run were largely characterized by major corporations and institutional players strategically adding digital assets like Bitcoin to their balance sheets. These entities aimed to diversify their holdings and capitalize on the long-term potential of cryptocurrencies. However, the narrative is now shifting. While corporate interest remains, the immediate buying pressure from this segment has decreased. This creates an opening for Spot ETFs to exert greater influence. These regulated investment vehicles offer a streamlined and accessible way for a broader range of investors, both institutional and retail, to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies without directly holding the underlying assets. This accessibility is a key factor in their renewed strength. Investors can easily integrate crypto exposure into traditional portfolios, benefiting from the transparency and regulatory oversight associated with ETFs. This dynamic showcases a maturing market where diverse investment avenues play distinct roles. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin’s Future? Looking ahead, Jamie Coutts offers a compelling long-term outlook for Bitcoin. He anticipates that BTC’s price will continue its upward trajectory, driven by two powerful forces: the wider adoption of blockchain technology across various industries and the ongoing devaluation of traditional fiat currencies. Despite this optimistic long-term view, Coutts also provides a pragmatic perspective on potential short-term challenges. Should the crypto market enter a bear phase, any decline is likely to be “shallow but prolonged.” This implies that we might not see dramatic, sharp drops in value, but rather extended periods of subdued growth or gradual depreciation. Key Takeaways for Investors: Long-Term Bullishness: Fundamental drivers like adoption and fiat devaluation support Bitcoin’s sustained growth. Shallow Bear Market Potential: Prepare for extended periods of slower movement rather than sharp crashes if a downturn occurs. ETFs as Indicators: Keep a close eye on Spot ETFs fund flows as a primary indicator of market sentiment and direction. Embracing the Evolution of Crypto Market Leadership The cryptocurrency market is nothing if not dynamic, constantly evolving and adapting. The current ascendancy of Spot ETFs as the primary market drivers marks a significant new phase. While the initial surge of corporate enthusiasm might have temporarily ebbed, the fundamental drivers for Bitcoin’s long-term growth remain incredibly robust. Investors are encouraged to stay informed about these evolving market forces and understand how different investment vehicles are shaping the future of digital assets. This shift underscores the growing maturity and institutionalization of the crypto space, offering diverse entry points and reflecting a broader acceptance of digital assets within the global financial landscape. Staying abreast of these changes allows investors to make informed decisions in a rapidly moving environment. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly are Spot ETFs? A1: Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are investment vehicles that hold an asset directly, like Bitcoin, and trade on traditional stock exchanges. They allow investors to gain exposure to the price movements of the underlying cryptocurrency without having to buy, store, or manage the digital asset themselves. Q2: Why has corporate crypto accumulation slowed down recently? A2: While specific reasons can vary, the slowdown might be attributed to several factors, including companies having already established their initial digital asset treasuries, a more cautious economic outlook, or a shift in focus towards other strategic initiatives. This doesn’t necessarily mean a loss of interest, but rather a pause in aggressive accumulation. Q3: How do global liquidity trends influence Spot ETFs? A3: Abundant global liquidity, meaning there is plenty of money circulating in the financial system, often encourages investment in riskier assets like cryptocurrencies and the ETFs that track them. When liquidity is high, investors have more capital available and are often more willing to allocate it to growth-oriented investments, boosting ETF fund flows. Q4: What is the long-term price outlook for Bitcoin, according to the analyst? A4: Analyst Jamie Coutts maintains a bullish long-term outlook for Bitcoin. He predicts its price will continue to rise, primarily driven by the increasing global adoption of blockchain technology and the ongoing devaluation of traditional fiat currencies over time. Q5: What does a “shallow but prolonged” bear phase imply for the crypto market? A5: A “shallow but prolonged” bear phase suggests that if the market experiences a downturn, it might not involve dramatic, sharp price crashes. Instead, it would likely be characterized by extended periods of sideways trading, gradual price depreciation, or very modest growth, making recovery a slower process rather than a swift rebound.

ETH is still the most important cryptocurrency, but investors are looking for altcoins that can give them big returns in the next 12 to 18 months. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a high-utility DeFi system featuring two loan structures, a new stablecoin, and predictable staking payouts. It might be a 10× performer compared to ETH. The platform’s architecture focuses on making the most of capital, managing risk, and creating long-term value. This makes it appealing to both individual and institutional crypto investors who want to look beyond traditional coins. ETH $7K forecast Ethereum (ETH) is on track for a $7,000 price target by late 2025, trading at ~$4,297 as of September 22, 2025, with a 24-hour trading volume of $37.07 billion. The forecast, supported by surging institutional demand, follows $11 billion in spot ETF inflows since July, including $3.87 billion in August alone, led by BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust holding 3.49 million ETH. Year-to-date, ETH has rallied over 100% from February lows near $2,255, driven by corporate treasury buys like SharpLink Gaming’s $400 million addition and reduced liquid supply from 36 million ETH staked (30% of total). Technical indicators show ETH consolidating between $4,150 support and $4,500 resistance, with RSI at 48 signaling neutral momentum amid the Dencun upgrade’s Layer-2 fee reductions. Social media buzz highlights ETH’s DeFi and stablecoin dominance, though U.S. tariffs and $346 million in liquidations pose risks. Analysts eye $6,800–$7,500 if inflows persist, with a potential Q4 breakout to $5,194. Dual lending, stable revenue, and predictable growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will operate dual lending pools to balance risk and return across asset classes. Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending will focus on blue-chip tokens and stablecoins, providing predictable interest for lenders, while Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending will isolate higher-risk assets like FLOKI and PEPE, allowing direct negotiation of terms and higher returns. Liquidation rules are designed to protect the protocol and depositors, while the reserve factor collects interest to strengthen the on-chain treasury. This predictable revenue will be channeled toward MUTM staking rewards, governance incentives, and open-market buybacks, creating a virtuous cycle that supports token demand. Borrowers benefit from overcollateralization, clear LTV limits, and automatic liquidation protocols that safeguard both individual positions and overall platform stability. Phase 6 of the MUTM presale has raised approximately $16.2 million, with 47% of the 170 million token allocation sold to over 16,550 holders. The current price of $0.035 presents a strategic entry point, as the next presale phase will increase the token price to $0.040, representing a 15% immediate gain. Investors are being urged to act quickly, as this phase offers the last chance to secure MUTM at a discounted price before the beta adoption and broader exchange listings drive substantial real-world demand. The upcoming beta launch will allow users to engage directly with Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s lending pools, stablecoin functionality, and staking options. Layer-2 integration will drastically reduce transaction fees and accelerate processing speeds, encouraging higher borrowing, lending, and staking activity. This combination of accessible utility and reduced friction will drive on-chain activity, further supporting the MUTM treasury and boosting demand for the token across both retail and institutional segments. Key drivers supporting MUTM demand and 10× potential Several core factors will support long-term MUTM growth and position it to potentially outperform ETH. The protocol’s robust oracle strategy ensures reliable pricing for supported assets, enabling secure liquidations while reducing the risk of manipulation, which will attract institutional users. Calibrated LTVs and liquidation thresholds allow measured exposure for borrowers and depositors, building confidence and encouraging more participation. Enhanced Collateral Efficiency enables higher borrowing limits, generating additional fees and expanding the protocol’s treasury, which will be used for staking and incentives to maintain token value. Finally, stable-rate borrowing will appeal to corporate and treasury users by providing predictable borrowing costs and sustainable revenue streams. These elements combined create a framework for MUTM demand that is independent of broader market volatility, highlighting its potential as a long-term growth asset. Planned listings on major exchanges, including Binance, Coinbase, KuCoin, Kraken, and MEXC, will further increase visibility, liquidity, and adoption. The roadmap ensures that users will experience real utility during the beta launch, enhancing confidence in the protocol while simultaneously creating organic demand. Security and community trust are core priorities for Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The platform has received a CertiK audit with a TokenScan score of 90 and a Skynet score of 79. A $50,000 bug bounty is available to ethical hackers, while an ongoing $100,000 giveaway rewards community participation with 10 winners receiving $10,000 in MUTMs each. With an active social presence exceeding 12,000 Twitter followers, MUTM is building a committed and engaged community. Phase 6 is already 47% sold. Investors are encouraged to secure MUTM at $0.035 before the next phase price jumps to $0.040. With structured DeFi mechanics, predictable revenue streams, Layer-2 scaling, and upcoming exchange listings, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents a high-utility opportunity for crypto investing, providing measurable upside potential beyond traditional crypto coins while benefiting from stable protocol economics and community-driven adoption.

An address, widely believed to be associated with the Ethena infrastructure firm StablecoinX, recently executed a substantial transfer. This move involves a considerable amount of ENA tokens, sparking discussions about its potential implications for the market and the Ethena ecosystem. Unpacking the Details of This Major ENA Withdrawal In the past 15 hours, on-chain analyst ai_9684xtpa reported a notable transaction: 19.23 million ENA tokens, valued at approximately $11.8 million, were withdrawn from Binance. This significant ENA withdrawal was executed by an address linked to StablecoinX, a key player within the Ethena ecosystem. Such large movements of assets often signal important operational or strategic decisions by major holders. For those unfamiliar, ENA is the governance token for the Ethena protocol. Ethena is known for its synthetic dollar protocol, USDe, which aims to provide a censorship-resistant, scalable, and stable digital asset. Therefore, any major movement of ENA tokens by an associated entity like StablecoinX is closely watched by investors and market observers. Why Does StablecoinX Hold So Much ENA? Following this recent transaction, the StablecoinX-linked address now holds a staggering 88.26 million ENA, worth an estimated $54 million. This substantial holding raises questions about the firm’s strategy and its long-term vision for the Ethena protocol. There are several potential reasons why a firm like StablecoinX might accumulate such a large amount of ENA: Treasury Management: Firms often hold native tokens as part of their treasury for operational expenses, ecosystem development, or strategic investments. Staking or Yield Generation: ENA tokens can be staked to participate in governance or potentially earn rewards, contributing to the protocol’s security and stability. Liquidity Provision: Holding large amounts of ENA might be for providing liquidity across various decentralized exchanges, which is crucial for market health. Ecosystem Development: As an infrastructure firm, StablecoinX might be accumulating ENA to fund future projects, grants, or initiatives that enhance the Ethena ecosystem. This considerable accumulation, marked by the recent ENA withdrawal , underscores StablecoinX’s deep involvement and commitment to the Ethena project. What Are the Market Implications of Such an ENA Withdrawal? Large withdrawals from centralized exchanges can have various effects on the broader market. When a significant amount of a token, like ENA, is moved off an exchange, it can temporarily reduce the available supply for trading. This might lead to decreased liquidity on that specific exchange, potentially influencing price dynamics. Moreover, a large ENA withdrawal can be interpreted in different ways by market participants. Some might view it as a bullish signal, suggesting that the holder intends to HODL (hold on for dear life) or stake the tokens, thus removing them from immediate selling pressure. Others might speculate about potential over-the-counter (OTC) deals or preparations for other strategic deployments. The transparency of on-chain data allows for such observations, but the exact intent often remains a subject of speculation until further actions are revealed. Navigating the Dynamics of ENA and Ethena’s Ecosystem The Ethena protocol continues to be a fascinating development in the stablecoin space, with its USDe synthetic dollar gaining traction. The ENA token plays a vital role in the governance and future direction of this innovative project. Monitoring the movements of key players, such as StablecoinX, provides valuable insights into the health and strategic trajectory of the ecosystem. For investors and enthusiasts, understanding the significance of events like this major ENA withdrawal is crucial. It highlights the importance of on-chain analytics in deciphering market sentiment and anticipating potential shifts. Active participation and informed decision-making are paramount in the fast-paced world of decentralized finance. In conclusion, the recent $11.8 million ENA withdrawal by a StablecoinX-linked address from Binance is more than just a transaction; it’s a signal. It points to active and strategic management within the Ethena ecosystem, suggesting a potential long-term vision for the accumulated tokens. While the exact motives remain private, such movements are critical indicators for anyone tracking the progress and stability of the Ethena protocol and its native ENA token. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is ENA? ENA is the native governance token of the Ethena protocol, a synthetic dollar platform that provides USDe, a censorship-resistant, scalable, and stable digital asset. ENA holders can participate in protocol governance and potentially earn rewards. Who is StablecoinX? StablecoinX is an infrastructure firm believed to be associated with the Ethena protocol. It plays a significant role in supporting the Ethena ecosystem, often through strategic holdings and movements of ENA tokens. Why do large cryptocurrency withdrawals from exchanges occur? Large withdrawals can occur for several reasons, including treasury management, staking tokens for yield or governance, providing liquidity to decentralized exchanges, moving assets to cold storage for security, or preparing for over-the-counter (OTC) transactions. How does this ENA withdrawal impact the Ethena protocol? While the direct impact on the protocol’s operations is often minimal, such a large ENA withdrawal by a key entity like StablecoinX can signal strong conviction in the project’s future, potentially affecting market sentiment and perceived stability of the ENA token. Where can I track ENA token movements? You can track ENA token movements on various blockchain explorers and on-chain analytics platforms that monitor the Ethereum network, where ENA tokens reside.

This move directly impacts traders holding or actively trading A/ETH, AUCTION/FDUSD, and RESOLV/BNB pairs, signaling a need for immediate action and awareness. What Does This Binance Delisting Mean for Traders? The upcoming Binance delisting , scheduled for 3:00 a.m. UTC on September 26, is a crucial event that requires attention from affected users. When an exchange delists a trading pair, it means that specific pair will no longer be available for spot trading on its platform. This can lead to a shift in market dynamics for the affected tokens. Specifically, the pairs being removed are: A/ETH AUCTION/FDUSD RESOLV/BNB Traders who currently hold positions in these pairs or the underlying assets need to understand the implications. The primary challenge is that you will no longer be able to buy or sell these specific combinations on Binance’s spot market after the deadline. This often prompts users to take action before the delisting date. Why Do Exchanges Conduct a Binance Delisting? Exchanges like Binance regularly review their listed assets to maintain a healthy and efficient trading environment. A Binance delisting , or any exchange delisting, is typically not an arbitrary decision. Several factors influence these decisions, all aimed at protecting users and upholding market integrity. Common reasons for a delisting include: Low Liquidity and Trading Volume: Pairs with insufficient trading activity can lead to poor price discovery and difficulty for users to execute trades efficiently. Project Performance and Viability: If a project fails to meet Binance’s listing standards, such as development activity, network stability, or regulatory compliance, it may be delisted. Security Concerns: Any security vulnerabilities or suspicious activity related to a token can trigger a delisting to protect users’ funds. Regulatory Changes: Evolving regulatory landscapes can sometimes necessitate the removal of certain trading pairs to comply with new rules. While Binance did not provide specific reasons for this particular Binance delisting in their initial announcement, these general criteria often apply. Navigating the Binance Delisting: Actionable Steps If you hold any of the tokens involved in the upcoming Binance delisting , taking timely action is essential. Ignoring the announcement could leave your assets in a less liquid state or require more complex steps to manage later. Here are some actionable insights for affected traders: Close Positions: If you have open spot orders for A/ETH, AUCTION/FDUSD, or RESOLV/BNB, consider closing them before September 26. All pending orders for these pairs will be automatically canceled upon delisting. Convert or Withdraw: You can convert the affected tokens (A, AUCTION, RESOLV) into other cryptocurrencies that remain listed on Binance, or withdraw them to an external wallet that supports the respective tokens. Monitor Announcements: Always stay informed by checking official Binance announcements for any further updates regarding these tokens or other future changes. This proactive approach ensures that your assets remain accessible and manageable, minimizing potential disruptions from the Binance delisting . The Broader Impact of Binance Delisting on the Market While the immediate impact of this Binance delisting is on the specific tokens and their traders, such events can also ripple through the broader crypto market. Delistings, especially from a major exchange like Binance, can sometimes signal concerns about the long-term viability or liquidity of certain projects. For the affected projects, a delisting from a top-tier exchange can reduce their exposure and potentially impact their price and liquidity on other platforms. However, it is also a reminder for investors to conduct thorough due diligence on their holdings and understand the risks associated with less liquid or smaller-cap assets. In conclusion, the upcoming Binance delisting of A/ETH, AUCTION/FDUSD, and RESOLV/BNB spot trading pairs is a critical update for the crypto community. Traders holding these assets must act swiftly to manage their portfolios effectively. By understanding the reasons behind such decisions and taking proactive steps, you can navigate these changes smoothly and continue to participate confidently in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency trading. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. Why did Binance decide on this particular delisting? Binance typically delists trading pairs due to factors such as low liquidity, poor trading volume, project performance concerns, security issues, or changes in regulatory compliance. While specific reasons for this delisting were not detailed, these are common justifications. 2. What happens to my funds if I don’t act before the delisting date? If you have open spot orders for the delisted pairs, they will be automatically canceled. Your underlying tokens (A, AUCTION, RESOLV) will still be in your Binance wallet, but you won’t be able to trade them against ETH, FDUSD, or BNB on the spot market. You would need to convert them to other assets or withdraw them. 3. Can I still withdraw A, AUCTION, or RESOLV tokens after September 26? Yes, typically, users can still withdraw delisted tokens from Binance for a period after the trading pairs are removed. However, it’s always best to check Binance’s official announcements for exact timelines and instructions regarding withdrawals. 4. How often does Binance perform a delisting of trading pairs? Binance regularly reviews its listed assets. Delistings occur periodically as part of their efforts to maintain a high-quality trading environment and comply with evolving market standards and regulations. Did you find this update helpful?

South Korean payment giant Danal unveiled a demo version of its upcoming stablecoin payment platform , promising a new era of seamless digital transactions. This exciting development is set to transform how users interact with their funds, bridging traditional finance with the efficiency of blockchain technology. Money Today reported on this significant demonstration, highlighting Danal’s commitment to innovation in the fintech space. What is Danal’s Revolutionary Stablecoin Payment Platform? Danal, a prominent South Korean payment firm, is gearing up to launch an innovative platform in November. This platform will enable users to easily convert their South Korean won (KRW) into a new stablecoin known as KSC. Once converted, the KSC stablecoin is immediately issued to the user’s personal digital wallet. This direct conversion and instant issuance are key features designed to streamline the payment process. The goal is to offer a reliable and efficient method for digital payments, leveraging the inherent stability of a stablecoin. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies, KSC is designed to maintain a stable value, likely pegged to the South Korean won, making it ideal for everyday transactions. This stability is paramount for consumer trust and widespread adoption. How Does This Stablecoin Platform Work for Everyday Users? Imagine a world where converting your local currency into a digital asset for payments is as simple as a few taps on your smartphone. Danal’s stablecoin payment platform aims to make this a reality for millions. Here’s a quick look at the user journey: Effortless Conversion: Users initiate a conversion of their South Korean won into KSC directly through the platform. Instant Issuance: The KSC stablecoins are immediately issued and deposited into their personal digital wallets, ready for use. Versatile Payments: These KSC stablecoins can then be utilized for various payments, offering a fast, secure, and cost-effective alternative to traditional payment methods. This system not only simplifies the process but also potentially reduces transaction fees and significantly speeds up settlement times, which are common advantages of blockchain-based payments. The platform’s demo at KBW 2025 highlighted its user-friendly interface and robust underlying technology, receiving positive feedback from attendees. The Broader Impact of Danal’s Stablecoin Payment Platform on Finance The introduction of such a platform by a major player like Danal could have profound implications for the digital economy, both locally and potentially globally. Firstly, it enhances financial inclusion by providing an accessible digital payment option for a wider audience. Secondly, it could foster greater adoption of blockchain technology in mainstream commerce, moving it beyond niche crypto communities. Moreover, businesses stand to benefit significantly from faster settlements and potentially lower processing costs compared to traditional banking systems. The inherent stability of KSC is a critical factor here. By minimizing price volatility, the platform ensures that users can transact with confidence, without the constant worry about the value of their digital assets fluctuating wildly. This makes it a highly practical and reliable solution for both consumers and merchants. Addressing Potential Challenges and Ensuring Trust in the Stablecoin Payment Platform While the benefits of a stablecoin payment platform are clear, it’s also important to consider potential challenges. Regulatory clarity, ensuring robust security measures against cyber threats, and maintaining adequate reserves to back the stablecoin are crucial for long-term success. Danal will need to navigate these aspects carefully to build and maintain user trust. Transparency in its operations and adherence to financial regulations will be key. As the platform prepares for its November launch, these considerations will undoubtedly be central to its strategy, ensuring a secure and compliant environment for all users. What’s Next for Danal and Paycoin’s Future? With the launch of its new stablecoin payment platform scheduled for November, Danal is clearly positioning itself at the forefront of digital payment innovation. This move signifies a strong commitment to integrating advanced blockchain solutions into everyday financial activities. Furthermore, Danal’s existing crypto project, Paycoin, is also preparing for a significant rebranding. This suggests a strategic realignment within the company to optimize its blockchain offerings and potentially integrate them more seamlessly for a unified user experience. The rebranding of Paycoin, while distinct from the KSC stablecoin launch, indicates a broader, forward-thinking vision for Danal in the digital asset space. It’s an exciting time for users and businesses alike, as these developments pave the way for more efficient, secure, and integrated payment ecosystems across South Korea. In conclusion, Danal’s upcoming stablecoin payment platform represents a pivotal moment for digital finance in South Korea and potentially beyond. By offering a stable, efficient, and user-friendly way to convert and use digital currency, Danal is setting a new standard for blockchain-powered payments. The November launch of the KSC stablecoin, alongside Paycoin’s strategic rebranding, marks a bold step towards a more integrated and accessible digital economy. This innovation is poised to deliver immense benefits, making digital transactions simpler and more secure for everyone, while also addressing the foundational aspects of trust and regulation. Frequently Asked Questions About Danal’s Stablecoin Platform What is KSC? KSC is a new stablecoin introduced by Danal, designed to be pegged to the South Korean won (KRW). It allows users to convert their KRW into a digital asset for stable and efficient payments. When is Danal’s stablecoin payment platform expected to launch? The platform is scheduled for an official launch in November. How will users convert KRW to KSC? Users will be able to convert their South Korean won directly into KSC through Danal’s new platform, with the stablecoins immediately issued to their personal digital wallets.

Is Paycoin related to the new KSC stablecoin? Paycoin is a separate existing project operated by Danal, which is undergoing a rebranding. While both are Danal initiatives in the crypto space, KSC is a new stablecoin for the upcoming payment platform. What are your thoughts on Danal’s innovative step into stablecoin payments?

A recent, massive deposit by Hayes has sent ripples through the digital asset community, prompting widespread speculation about its potential impact. If you follow crypto market dynamics, you know that when a figure like Arthur Hayes makes a significant move, everyone pays attention. What’s Behind Arthur Hayes ONDO’s Latest Strategic Move? On-chain analyst ai_9684xtpa recently reported a noteworthy transaction: an address widely believed to belong to Arthur Hayes deposited a substantial 26.28 million ONDO tokens to various top-tier exchanges. This colossal sum, valued at approximately $24.7 million, found its way to Coinbase, Bybit, Binance, and OKX around 14 hours prior to the analyst’s observation. The analyst’s findings confirm that these tokens were originally received directly from the Ondo Finance project. This isn’t the first time Hayes has executed such a high-profile maneuver. He previously moved significant holdings of Ether.Fi (ETHFI) and Ethena (ENA) to exchanges, establishing a pattern that market observers now keenly follow. The sheer scale of this Arthur Hayes ONDO deposit immediately raises questions about his intentions and potential market implications. Understanding the Significance of Arthur Hayes ONDO Deposits Why does a single individual’s deposit create such a stir in the vast crypto landscape? Arthur Hayes is not just any investor; he is a co-founder of BitMEX, a prominent derivatives exchange, and a highly influential voice in the crypto space. His market insights and actions are often perceived as indicators of broader trends or personal strategic plays. When an influential figure like Hayes moves a large quantity of a specific altcoin, it can signal several things: Profit-Taking: It might indicate that Hayes believes the asset has reached a favorable price point for him to realize gains. Portfolio Rebalancing: He could be shifting capital between different assets to optimize his holdings based on his market outlook. Market Signal: Some interpret such moves as a potential bearish signal for the asset, suggesting an impending price correction, while others see it as simply preparing for increased liquidity. The ONDO token itself is central to Ondo Finance, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol focused on bringing real-world assets (RWAs) onto the blockchain. As RWAs gain traction in DeFi, projects like Ondo Finance are drawing significant interest, making Hayes’ involvement and subsequent moves even more critical to observe. Past Precedents: How Arthur Hayes ONDO Compares to Previous Altcoin Moves As mentioned, this isn’t Hayes’ first rodeo. His previous deposits of ETHFI and ENA offer a glimpse into how the market might react. Following his ETHFI deposits, there was a period of heightened volatility for the token. Similarly, his ENA movements were closely watched, influencing sentiment around the Ethena protocol. Each of these instances highlights the ‘influencer effect’ in the crypto market. Large movements by well-known figures can trigger a cascade of reactions, from retail investors to algorithmic traders. However, it’s crucial to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results, and each asset and market condition is unique. The context surrounding this specific Arthur Hayes ONDO deposit, including broader market sentiment and Ondo Finance’s developments, plays a vital role. Navigating the Market After Arthur Hayes ONDO’s Action: What Should Investors Consider? For investors and traders, a move like this by Arthur Hayes ONDO holdings necessitates careful consideration rather than impulsive action. Here are some actionable insights: Conduct Your Own Research: Do not solely rely on the actions of prominent figures. Deep dive into Ondo Finance’s fundamentals, its tokenomics, and its roadmap. Monitor On-Chain Data: Tools used by analysts like ai_9684xtpa can provide valuable real-time insights into large wallet movements and exchange flows. Assess Market Sentiment: Observe how the broader crypto community and other analysts are interpreting this specific Arthur Hayes ONDO deposit. Implement Risk Management: If you hold ONDO or are considering investing, set clear entry and exit strategies, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. While Hayes’ actions are certainly newsworthy, they are one data point among many. The long-term success of ONDO and Ondo Finance will depend on its adoption, utility, and overall market conditions, not just individual whale movements. In conclusion, Arthur Hayes’ substantial deposit of ONDO tokens to exchanges has once again ignited discussions across the crypto world. This move, consistent with his past activities involving other altcoins, underscores the significant influence that key figures can wield in the volatile digital asset market. While his intentions remain a subject of debate, it serves as a powerful reminder for all market participants to approach such developments with a critical eye, prioritizing independent analysis and robust risk management strategies.

The digital landscape is constantly evolving, and privacy remains a paramount concern for many. This is where innovation steps in, offering solutions that respect user anonymity while still recognizing valuable contributions. A groundbreaking development has just emerged that promises to redefine how social influence and on-chain activity are rewarded. Zero-knowledge (ZK) technology firm Brevis, in a strategic alliance with AI-based Web3 information platform Kaito AI, has officially launched the Yapper Leaderboard campaign – a brand-new, privacy-enhancing rewards system. What Makes the Yapper Leaderboard Truly Revolutionary? The Yapper Leaderboard isn’t just another rewards program; it’s a paradigm shift in how we approach Web3 incentives. This innovative system ingeniously combines traditional social influence metrics with the cutting-edge power of ZK-verified on-chain credentials. What does this mean for you, the user? It means you can now earn greater rewards by proving your valuable contributions to the crypto ecosystem without the need to directly link your social media accounts to your digital wallets. Imagine demonstrating you were an early adopter of a promising project, a seasoned DeFi expert navigating complex protocols, or a loyal, long-term holder committed to a specific asset. With the Yapper Leaderboard , you can verify these achievements securely and privately. This approach ensures that your hard-earned reputation and on-chain history translate into tangible benefits, all while maintaining your anonymity. How Does ZK Technology Power Secure Rewards on the Yapper Leaderboard? At the heart of the Yapper Leaderboard ‘s innovative design lies zero-knowledge (ZK) technology. ZK proofs allow one party to prove to another that a statement is true, without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself. In this context, it enables Brevis to verify your on-chain achievements – such as specific transaction histories, token holdings, or protocol interactions – without ever needing to know your wallet address or personal identity. This revolutionary method offers unparalleled privacy protection. Users can confidently participate, knowing their sensitive financial data and social profiles remain unexposed. It effectively creates a bridge between verifiable on-chain history and social influence, rewarding genuine engagement and expertise in the InfoFi (Information Finance) space in a truly secure and confidential manner. Key benefits of this ZK-powered approach include: Enhanced Privacy: Your social identity remains separate from your on-chain credentials. Fairer Distribution: Rewards are based on verifiable contributions, not just popularity. Reduced Sybil Attacks: ZK proofs can help prevent malicious actors from gaming the system. Broader Participation: Users concerned about data privacy can now engage confidently. What Can Participants Expect from the Yapper Leaderboard Campaign? The Yapper Leaderboard campaign is structured to maximize engagement and reward distribution, unfolding in two distinct phases. Top-performing participants throughout these phases will receive a significant portion of Brevis’s highly anticipated Token Generation Event (TGE) allocation. This direct reward mechanism incentivizes genuine participation and recognizes those who demonstrate verifiable expertise and commitment within the InfoFi sector. This partnership between Brevis and Kaito AI is not just about distributing tokens; it’s about setting a groundbreaking new benchmark. They are establishing a superior standard for privacy-enhancing reward distribution within the rapidly expanding InfoFi sector. It represents a bold step forward in building a more equitable and privacy-conscious Web3 ecosystem, where true value contributors are recognized and rewarded without compromise. Looking Ahead: The Future of Privacy-Centric Rewards with the Yapper Leaderboard The launch of the Yapper Leaderboard marks a pivotal moment for both Brevis and Kaito AI, and indeed, for the wider Web3 community. By seamlessly integrating ZK technology with social influence metrics, they have crafted a system that prioritizes user privacy while robustly rewarding verifiable on-chain credentials. This initiative promises to foster a more authentic and secure environment for earning cryptocurrency rewards, moving beyond superficial metrics to acknowledge genuine, impactful contributions.

This development, occurring on September 23rd, has certainly captured the attention of investors and analysts alike, prompting questions about market sentiment and future trends. What exactly triggered this sudden downturn, and what does it signify for the broader crypto landscape? Unpacking the Recent Spot Crypto ETF Outflows: Who Was Affected? Data from TraderT revealed a significant withdrawal of capital from these popular investment vehicles. Let’s break down the specifics: Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs: These funds collectively saw $103.55 million exit. While BlackRock’s IBIT managed to attract a modest $2.6 million in net inflows, this positive movement was overshadowed by substantial outflows from other major players. Fidelity’s FBTC experienced a significant $75.56 million outflow, Bitwise’s BITB saw $12.76 million withdrawn, and Ark Invest’s ARKB recorded $27.85 million in redemptions. Ethereum (ETH) ETFs: The situation for spot ETH ETFs was even more pronounced, with approximately $140 million in net outflows and no funds reporting any inflows. Fidelity’s FETH led the outflows with $63.4 million, followed by Bitwise’s ETHW at $23.88 million. Grayscale’s ETHE and its Mini ETH fund also contributed to the negative trend, seeing $17.1 million and $36.37 million exit, respectively. These widespread Spot Crypto ETF outflows across multiple prominent funds indicate a broad shift in investor behavior. Powell’s Powerful Words: A Catalyst for Market Jitters and Spot Crypto ETF Outflows? The timing of these withdrawals is particularly telling. They closely followed public remarks by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. He delivered a stark assessment, stating that stock prices appear to be ‘quite overvalued in many respects.’ Such comments from a figure of Powell’s stature often send ripples through financial markets, and this instance was no exception. Both traditional equity markets and the cryptocurrency sector experienced declines shortly after his statements. The connection is clear: when investors perceive traditional assets as overvalued or face economic uncertainty, they often re-evaluate their portfolios. This can lead to a reduction in exposure to riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies and the ETFs that track them. Therefore, Powell’s cautionary tone likely played a significant role in accelerating the recent Spot Crypto ETF outflows . What Do These Outflows Mean for the Future of Crypto ETFs? While a single day or two of outflows doesn’t define a long-term trend, consistent withdrawals can signal evolving market sentiment. Investors should consider several implications: Increased Volatility: Outflows can contribute to price volatility in the underlying assets (Bitcoin and Ethereum), as fund managers may need to sell holdings to meet redemptions. Investor Caution: These movements suggest a more cautious stance among some institutional and retail investors, potentially due to broader macroeconomic concerns or a reassessment of crypto’s immediate growth prospects. Market Maturity: The existence of spot ETFs means that crypto markets are increasingly integrated with traditional finance. Consequently, they are more susceptible to macroeconomic factors and statements from central bank leaders like Powell. The ability to easily move in and out of these funds highlights their liquidity and accessibility. Understanding the dynamics behind these Spot Crypto ETF outflows is crucial for anyone looking to navigate the evolving digital asset space effectively. The recent wave of U.S. Spot Crypto ETF outflows for Bitcoin and Ethereum funds underscores the ongoing sensitivity of the crypto market to macroeconomic signals, particularly those from influential figures like Jerome Powell. While these outflows represent a moment of caution, they also highlight the increasing integration of digital assets into the mainstream financial system. Investors are advised to stay informed, monitor market trends, and consider their long-term investment strategies in light of these developments. The journey of crypto ETFs is still relatively young, and such fluctuations are a natural part of its evolution. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What are Spot Crypto ETFs? Spot Crypto ETFs are exchange-traded funds that directly hold the underlying cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, allowing investors to gain exposure without directly owning the digital assets. 2. Why did Spot BTC and ETH ETFs experience outflows? The outflows primarily followed remarks by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who suggested stock prices were “quite overvalued.” This likely prompted investors to reduce exposure to riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies. 3. Are these outflows a sign of a bear market? While two days of outflows indicate caution, they don’t definitively signal a long-term bear market. It’s a snapshot of market sentiment influenced by specific macroeconomic factors. Continued monitoring of trends is essential. 4. How do Spot Crypto ETF outflows impact Bitcoin and Ethereum prices? When ETFs experience outflows, fund managers might sell underlying BTC or ETH to meet redemption requests. This selling pressure can contribute to a decrease in the prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum. 5. Which funds saw the largest outflows? For Bitcoin, Fidelity’s FBTC saw the largest outflow. For Ethereum, Fidelity’s FETH and Grayscale’s Mini ETH experienced significant withdrawals.

Here's what's making news in the markets: In the lead-up to Seoul's Korea Blockchain Week, discussions about a Korean Won stablecoin were among the leading narratives. The idea carries political weight, positioning local currencies as digital alternatives to the U.S. dollar. However, despite the enthusiasm, most Asian currencies are hindered by capital controls that render them unsuitable for global circulation. That leaves the Hong Kong dollar as the region’s only truly usable stablecoin base. In Korea, a bill to legalize stablecoins is making its way through the country's legislative bodies. Lawmakers are clear that the initiative is not intended to globalize the Won; offshore use is impossible due to Korea's post-1997 rules aimed at preventing capital flight. South America's re-dollarization via USDT is an example of something lawmakers in Korea don't want. Instead, it's being pitched as a defense of monetary sovereignty against dollar-based tokens. Korea's central bank chief says he's not against Won stablecoins , but has concerns over foreign convertibility. But the same restrictions that preserve sovereignty also block international utility. Korea’s won cannot circulate offshore without triggering the same risks of capital flight that scarred the economy in 1997. Without carving out a special jurisdiction or sandbox where such a token could flow freely, effectively mimicking Hong Kong’s SAR status, a KRW stablecoin will remain confined to the domestic market. The paradox extends to other Asian currencies. Taiwan’s New Taiwan dollar is locked inside its borders. The renminbi is only partially convertible , restricted on the capital account, which is why Beijing relies on the offshore CNH market. In each case, local stablecoin proposals serve a domestic policy agenda, but cannot scale globally. Hong Kong stands apart. Its dollar is fully convertible, supported by a currency board that pegs it to the U.S. dollar (within a trading band) through extensive reserves. Capital flows are unrestricted, and the HKD is already widely used internationally in bond markets and for cross-border settlements. A tokenized HKD would be the only Asian stablecoin capable of circulating globally, bridging domestic policy needs with international liquidity. The irony is that capital controls designed to protect monetary sovereignty ultimately reinforce the dominance of dollar-backed stablecoins. Unless regional governments are willing to liberalize, the HKD remains the only local currency that can plausibly challenge USDT and USDC on a global stage. But then, what's the point? With its peg, the HKD is a de-facto U.S. dollar stablecoin already. Market Movements BTC: Bitcoin is trading flat at $112k as ETF flows turn negative. Investors pulled $363M from BTC ETFs as the week began, according to data curated by SoSoValue . ETH: ETH is underperforming BTC in the short term as speculative demand softens and risk sentiment weakens, even as long-term drivers like staking and DeFi remain supportive. Gold: Gold is climbing to fresh highs, fueled by expectations of U.S. rate cuts, a weaker dollar, and demand for a safe haven amid macro uncertainty. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets fell on Wednesday, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 down 0.33% as stocks in the region tracked their U.S. counterparts. S&P 500: U.S. stock futures held steady Tuesday night after the S&P 500 ended a three-day winning streak and retreated from record highs.

Social Media Users Are Calling To Buy The Bitcoin Dip In a new Insight post, analytics firm Santiment has talked about how the market has been reacting to the latest plunge in the Bitcoin price. “One of the first things we like to look for is a sign of retailers showing enthusiasm toward buying the dip,” notes Santiment. The indicator cited by the analytics firm is the “Social Volume,” which measures the total amount of posts/messages/threads appearing on the major social media platforms that make unique mentions of a given term or topic. Related Reading: Here’s The Boundary Bitcoin Bulls Must Defend To Save Rally Santiment has filtered the Social Volume for Bitcoin-related keywords and terms pertaining to calls for “buy the dip.” Below is a chart showing the trend in the metric over the past month. As is visible in the graph, the Bitcoin Social Volume has spiked for these terms, indicating that interest in buying the dip has surged among social media users. At the current value, dip-buying calls are at their highest in 25 days. While this could sound like a signal that a rebound may be coming soon for the cryptocurrency, history has had many examples of the contrary. “Prices typically move the opposite direction of the crowd’s expectations,” explains the analytics firm. Considering this, the dip-buying hype could actually be a sign that more pain may be ahead for BTC before the bottom can actually be in. “Once the crowd stops feeling optimistic, and they begin to sell their bags at a loss, this is typically the time to strike with your dip buys,” says Santiment. Another gauge for market sentiment is through the Binance Funding Rate, which is a metric that keeps track of the periodic fee that derivatives traders are exchanging between each other on the largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume. Related Reading: Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Signals ‘Fear’ As Price Falls To $112,000 The indicator turned sharp red just ahead of the latest plummet in the Bitcoin price, indicating that short positions became dominant on Binance. After the decline, however, traders changed their tune as the metric switched back to being green. This trend would suggest that investors are hoping Bitcoin would rebound soon. “Ideally, for a notable price bounce to occur, we need to see a sustained period of shorts outpacing longs,” notes the analytics firm. As such, this could be another indicator to keep an eye on, as a flip into the negative for an extended phase may pave the way toward a bottom. BTC Price Bitcoin has been unable to make recovery from its crash so far as its price continues to trade around $112,700.

52175222,587380,1758682847,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52175222.jpeg,Tether And Circle Print $1.5B In Hours: Fresh Liquidity Incoming,https://bitcoinist.com/tether-and-circle-print-1-5b-hours-fresh-liquidity/,"The stablecoin market is once again making headlines as two of the largest issuers, Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC), significantly expanded supply in just hours. According to data shared by Lookonchain, Tether minted another 1 billion USDT, while Circle printed 500 million USDC only seven hours earlier. These issuances highlight how stablecoins continue to play a central role in fueling market liquidity, often acting as precursors to major shifts in crypto price action. Stablecoins are widely used as dry powder, giving traders and institutions instant exposure to digital assets without relying on traditional banking rails. Large-scale minting events like this are typically interpreted as a sign that capital is flowing into the ecosystem, positioning the market for heightened volatility and potentially a new wave of demand. Historically, such moves have coincided with phases of increased activity across Bitcoin, Ethereum, and major altcoins. As crypto investors brace for the next leg of market action, the timing of this combined $1.5 billion injection into USDT and USDC supply has sparked speculation. Many analysts believe the market is preparing to absorb this liquidity , setting the stage for what could be a decisive period in the weeks ahead. Stablecoin Expansion And Market Implications According to CryptoQuant, the combined circulating supply of Tether (USDT) and Circle’s USD Coin (USDC) now forms a significant portion of the global stablecoin market, which sits at around $147 billion. This dominance underscores the pivotal role both issuers play in shaping crypto liquidity. With Tether minting another $1 billion and Circle adding $500 million in supply, these issuances are not random — they reflect growing demand for stable trading capital and often precede decisive market moves. Stablecoins act as a bridge between traditional finance and the crypto ecosystem, serving as the backbone for trading activity on centralized and decentralized exchanges. When supply expands rapidly, it typically signals an increase in available liquidity, providing investors with the ability to deploy capital into risk assets quickly. For Bitcoin, which recently faced heavy volatility and a sharp pullback below $115K, this influx could offer support for a continuation trend, particularly if bulls regain momentum. For altcoins, the impact may be even more pronounced. Historically, stablecoin inflows have fueled periods of explosive growth in non-BTC assets, as traders rotate capital in search of higher returns. With USDT and USDC issuance climbing, analysts suggest that the coming days could define whether altcoins recover strongly or remain under pressure. Stablecoin Market Cap Dominance Analysis The chart shows that stablecoin dominance has risen sharply to 7.99%, signaling a renewed demand for safety amid recent volatility. After weeks of consolidation between 7.4% and 7.8%, the breakout above the short-term moving averages (50-day at 7.60% and 100-day at 7.63%) confirms stronger capital rotation into stable assets. This pattern often reflects heightened investor caution, with participants opting to sit in stablecoins while waiting for clearer market direction. The move higher coincides with recent liquidations across Bitcoin and altcoins, where leveraged traders were wiped out. Historically, spikes in stablecoin dominance occur when traders de-risk, pulling capital from volatile assets. However, rising stablecoin reserves also indicate available liquidity that could quickly re-enter the market and fuel recovery once sentiment shifts. If dominance continues to climb toward the 8.2–8.4% range, it may suggest further downside for risk assets in the short term. Conversely, stabilization below this level could mark a base for renewed inflows into Bitcoin and altcoins. The coming sessions will be key in determining whether this rise is a temporary flight to safety or the start of a deeper risk-off trend.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-to-xrp-holders-massive-xrp-move-is-loading-heres-why/,"XRP has remained one of the most closely watched digital assets as traders evaluate its recent price movements against long-term patterns. Since July, the cryptocurrency has experienced some turbulence and fallen into a narrow trading range, reflecting a period of consolidation . This environment brings attention to technical indicators that help gauge potential volatility and market trends. Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto), a prominent crypto analyst on X, recently posted a chart predicting that this consolidation is near its end due to a significant Bollinger Band squeeze that often precedes major shifts. MASSIVE #XRP MOVE LOADING.. pic.twitter.com/ifxjCa1zhF — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) September 22, 2025 XRP’s Bollinger Band Reactions The chart he shared covers XRP trading against the U.S. dollar on a 3-day timeframe. It highlights several periods where the Bollinger Bands contracted before price activity increased. The Bollinger Bands, which consist of a moving average flanked by upper and lower bands, narrow when volatility decreases and widen when it increases. The first squeeze came in late 2024, just before a rapid expansion and a 500% price surge, sending the asset above $3 for the first time since 2018. The next major Bollinger Band squeeze occurred in early July . This contraction gave way to another notable surge, sending XRP to a new all-time high of $3.65 . These two examples framed how XRP reacted historically when volatility dropped to compressed levels and then expanded rapidly. By calling attention to the tightening bands, the chart places the current market setup in the context of previous events where similar squeezes preceded notable price movements. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Current Bollinger Band Squeeze and Market Outlook The chart marks the present Bollinger Band squeeze, with the bands signaling reduced volatility. This pattern closely mirrors the previous highlighted periods on the chart. Market participants often watch for a breakout when such a squeeze forms, since it can indicate a shift from consolidation to a new trend. By presenting these compressions side by side, the chart establishes a clear comparison between previous and current conditions. This approach enables observers to see how XRP has behaved in the past when volatility reached similar levels. Steph’s message reinforces the idea that this latest setup could be significant. Although the chart does not predict a direction, it positions the current squeeze as a point of interest similar to past setups. According to the analyst, a massive move is coming. Other analysts are also bullish on XRP , and a breakout from the current setup could help the asset target a new all-time high.

Cipollone pointed to a “major breakthrough” last week after euro area finance chiefs agreed on a framework for customer holding limits, a key feature for controlling usage and safeguarding bank deposits. “The discussion at the level of member-states is going very well,” he told a Bloomberg Future of Finance event in Frankfurt on Tuesday. On timing, he added that “the middle of 2029 could be a fair assessment.” The digital euro could become a reality in 2029 as efforts intensify to get the long-running project off the ground, according to European Central Bank Executive Board member Piero Cipollone https://t.co/NmFu8GHuEF — Bloomberg (@business) September 23, 2025 Digital Euro Drive Aims To Limit Stablecoin Dominance As EU Lawmakers Weigh Rules The ECB has been pushing the initiative for years to reduce reliance on private payment giants such as Visa and PayPal. Officials also want to ensure that dollar-backed stablecoins do not set the standard for everyday digital payments across Europe. Legislation remains the biggest hurdle. The European Parliament must approve the legal underpinnings of the project. Cipollone said that following an Oct. 24 progress report, lawmakers will have six weeks to propose amendments, then five months for negotiations. That schedule could yield an early May milestone. “By beginning of May, we should have a position also of the parliament,” he said. Member states are working in parallel. “We should arrive at a general approach, as they call it, an agreement among member-states by the end of the year,” Cipollone said. Design Questions Loom Over Digital Euro, From Privacy To Coexistence With Banks Technical choices are still open. Officials have reportedly weighed building on a public blockchain such as Ethereum or Solana , a shift from earlier thinking that favored a private ledger operated by the Eurosystem. Supporters say an open network could broaden reach. Critics warn it could expose transactions and complicate privacy protections. Backers argue a digital euro could lower costs, increase transparency and speed up retail payments. Skeptics question how the design will protect user privacy , coexist with banks and compete with existing stablecoins without distorting markets. The ECB has moved in stages, from initial study to a preparation phase, while national governments and EU institutions shape the rulebook. Even with momentum, launch will require political agreement, technical readiness and safeguards that meet Europe’s standards on privacy and stability.

Financial authorities are currently engaged in a pivotal discussion about potentially easing the country’s existing South Korean crypto rule , specifically the ‘one exchange, one bank’ policy. This reassessment could dramatically reshape the nation’s digital asset landscape, fostering greater competition and innovation. Understanding the South Korean Crypto Rule: ‘One Exchange, One Bank’ For some time, South Korea has operated under a strict ‘one exchange, one bank’ policy. This means that each crypto exchange could only partner with a single commercial bank for real-name accounts. Initially, this South Korean crypto rule aimed to strengthen anti-money laundering (AML) efforts. Banks were tasked with assisting crypto exchanges in meeting their stringent AML obligations, providing a layer of oversight. However, as the global crypto market evolves rapidly, this policy has drawn increasing scrutiny. Many believe it inadvertently reinforces monopolies, hindering the free market and stifling innovation. Why Are Regulators Rethinking This Crucial Policy? The Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) is spearheading this reevaluation. Park Joo-young, director of the Planning and Administration Office at the FIU, highlighted the reasons behind this crucial reassessment during a recent event. Global Competition: South Korea aims to remain competitive in the fast-paced global crypto market. The current rule might be putting local exchanges at a disadvantage. Public Concerns: There are growing public and industry concerns that the policy limits market entry and reinforces the dominance of a few large players. Balancing Act: Regulators face the delicate task of balancing effective money laundering prevention with the principles of free-market competition. The authorities are actively gathering feedback from all stakeholders. This includes both banks and crypto exchanges, whose opinions are understandably divided on the future of the South Korean crypto rule . What Challenges and Opportunities Lie Ahead? Easing the ‘one exchange, one bank’ South Korean crypto rule presents both opportunities and challenges. On one hand, it could unlock significant benefits for the market: Increased Competition: More banks could partner with exchanges, leading to a more dynamic and competitive trading environment. Innovation Boost: New exchanges and services might emerge, fostering greater innovation in product offerings and user experience. Consumer Choice: Users could benefit from more diverse options and potentially lower fees as exchanges vie for business. On the other hand, regulators must carefully navigate potential pitfalls. Ensuring robust AML measures remain in place is paramount. Any changes must include new safeguards to prevent excessive concentration of power and mitigate risks associated with financial crime. The process involves intricate discussions and a thorough understanding of market dynamics and potential regulatory gaps. What Does This Mean for South Korea’s Crypto Future? The outcome of this regulatory reassessment will have profound implications for South Korea’s position in the global crypto economy. A thoughtful and balanced approach could solidify the nation’s reputation as a forward-thinking hub for digital assets. This potential shift signals a move towards a more mature and adaptable regulatory framework. It acknowledges that initial safeguards, while well-intentioned, may need adjustments to keep pace with an evolving industry. The ongoing dialogue between regulators, banks, and exchanges is a healthy sign. It demonstrates a commitment to fostering a secure yet competitive environment for crypto trading in South Korea. The reevaluation of the ‘one exchange, one bank’ South Korean crypto rule marks a significant moment for the country’s digital asset market. By carefully weighing the need for strong anti-money laundering measures against the desire for a competitive, innovative market, South Korean regulators are striving for a framework that benefits both consumers and the industry. The world will be watching closely as this crucial policy evolves, potentially setting a new standard for crypto regulation globally. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the ‘one exchange, one bank’ rule in South Korea? The ‘one exchange, one bank’ rule is a regulatory policy in South Korea that historically required each cryptocurrency exchange to partner with only one commercial bank for managing real-name accounts for its users. Why was this South Korean crypto rule originally implemented? The rule was initially put in place to enhance anti-money laundering (AML) efforts. It aimed to have banks assist crypto exchanges in fulfilling their AML obligations, providing a layer of oversight for transactions. Why are South Korean regulators considering easing this rule now? Regulators are reassessing the rule due to concerns that it may be reinforcing monopolies and hindering free-market competition amid fierce global competition in the crypto sector. They seek to balance effective AML with market dynamism. What are the potential benefits of easing the ‘one exchange, one bank’ policy? Easing the rule could lead to increased competition among exchanges, foster greater innovation in crypto products and services, and offer consumers more choice and potentially better trading conditions. What challenges might arise from changing the South Korean crypto rule? The primary challenge involves ensuring that easing the rule does not compromise anti-money laundering efforts or introduce new risks of financial crime. Regulators must implement new safeguards to maintain market integrity. How will the industry’s feedback influence the decision? Regulators are actively gathering feedback from both banks and crypto exchanges. Their diverse opinions will be carefully considered to inform a balanced decision that addresses market needs while upholding regulatory standards. Did you find this article insightful?

Several high-profile actors also attended the landmark crypto wedding on the French Riviera, including “High School Musical” lead Zac Efron, “The Vampire Diaries” actress Nina Dobrev and “Top Gun” star Miles Teller. SEC Rolls Back Ripple Litigation Garlinghouse’s wedding is at least the second significant event of the crypto executive’s year. In May, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that it had officially filed a settlement agreement that would effectively resolve its years-long legal battle against Ripple. The federal regulator initially sued Ripple in December 2020 when it alleged that it sold its XRP tokens as unregistered securities. “This is it – the moment we’ve been waiting for,” Garlinghouse said in a video posted to X this past spring. “The SEC will drop its appeal – a resounding victory for Ripple, for crypto, every way you look at it.” “The future is bright,” he added. “Let’s build.” The move to rescind the case against Ripple is seen as part of a broader campaign to roll back its regulation-by-enforcement approach to the blockchain industry. The SEC has also dropped legislation against several crypto companies including Gemini, Coinbase and Binance – though it remains to be seen who else may see enforcement actions against them paused before the year’s end.

The cryptocurrency market is buzzing with anticipation as Bitcoin volatility has recently dropped to its lowest levels seen since 2023. This period of unusual calm often precedes a dramatic shift in price action, making now a crucial time for every crypto enthusiast and investor to pay close attention. Are we on the cusp of another monumental move for the world’s leading digital asset? What Does Low Bitcoin Volatility Really Mean? When we talk about Bitcoin volatility , we are referring to its implied volatility, which measures the market’s expectation of future price swings. A low implied volatility suggests that traders anticipate smaller price movements in the near term. Historically, such periods of tranquility in the Bitcoin market have often been the calm before a storm, or more accurately, a significant surge. For example, in a previous instance of low volatility in 2023, Bitcoin experienced a remarkable 325% surge, climbing from approximately $29,000 to an impressive $124,000. This historical pattern suggests that the current quiet phase could be the market accumulating energy for another substantial price breakout. The question, of course, is which direction will it take? Are We Accumulating Energy for a Major Move? According to insights from XWIN Research Japan, a respected contributor to CryptoQuant, several key indicators suggest that the market is indeed building up for a significant event. These factors collectively paint a picture of reduced selling pressure and a balanced market, poised for a decisive directional move. Let’s explore these crucial signals: Declining Exchange Balances: Bitcoin balances held on exchanges have fallen to multi-year lows. This reduction in available BTC on trading platforms typically weakens potential selling pressure, as fewer coins are readily accessible for immediate liquidation. Neutral MVRV Ratio: The Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio currently sits in a neutral zone at 2.1. This indicates that Bitcoin is neither significantly overbought nor oversold, suggesting a healthy market without extreme speculative froth or capitulation. Stable Futures Funding Rates: Funding rates in the derivatives market remain stable, showing no signs of overheating. This is a positive indicator, as excessively high funding rates can signal an overleveraged market prone to sharp corrections. These combined metrics suggest a market that is not only calm but also fundamentally strong, setting the stage for a potentially powerful price discovery phase. The underlying structure appears robust, hinting at an impending shift. What Can We Expect from Bitcoin Volatility Next? While the indicators strongly point towards an impending breakout, the precise direction of this next major move remains uncertain. This is the inherent challenge and excitement of cryptocurrency markets. Will Bitcoin volatility lead to an upward explosion, echoing past bull runs, or could it trigger a downward correction? The historical context of previous low volatility periods often suggests an upward trajectory, especially when coupled with strong fundamental indicators like decreasing exchange supply. However, savvy investors understand that market dynamics can shift rapidly. Preparing for both bullish and bearish scenarios is always a prudent approach. This period of consolidation provides an opportunity for investors to re-evaluate their portfolios, conduct thorough research, and strategize for potential market shifts. Understanding these underlying market signals can empower you to make more informed decisions rather than reacting purely to price action. How Can Investors Navigate This Calm Before the Storm? Given the current low Bitcoin volatility and the signs pointing to an imminent significant move, how should investors position themselves? It is a time for careful consideration and strategic planning, not impulsive action. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Continuously monitor key on-chain metrics, market sentiment, and global economic factors that could influence Bitcoin’s price. Risk Management: Ensure your portfolio is diversified and that you have a clear risk management strategy in place. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Long-Term Perspective: For many, Bitcoin remains a long-term investment. Periods of low volatility can be excellent opportunities for dollar-cost averaging. Prepare for Either Direction: While history favors an upside move, be ready for potential downside. Have a plan for both scenarios to protect your capital and capitalize on opportunities. The market is holding its breath, and this rare moment of suppressed Bitcoin volatility could be the precursor to one of the most exciting periods in recent cryptocurrency history. Being prepared and understanding the signals will be key to navigating whatever comes next. In conclusion, the current state of extremely low Bitcoin volatility , mirroring conditions from early 2023, is a compelling signal for a significant market event. With diminishing selling pressure, a balanced market, and stable derivatives, all signs suggest that Bitcoin is coiling up for a powerful move. While the exact direction is yet to be revealed, the stage is set for an exciting chapter in Bitcoin’s journey. Staying informed and strategically positioned will be paramount for investors looking to capitalize on this impending shift. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is implied volatility in Bitcoin? A1: Implied volatility in Bitcoin refers to the market’s expectation of how much Bitcoin’s price will fluctuate in the future. Low implied volatility means traders anticipate smaller price movements. Q2: Why is low Bitcoin volatility significant? A2: Historically, periods of unusually low Bitcoin volatility have often preceded significant price movements, acting as a “calm before the storm.” It suggests energy is accumulating for a breakout. Q3: What factors suggest a major move is ahead for Bitcoin?

Q4: Is the direction of the upcoming Bitcoin price move certain? A4: No, while indicators suggest a major move, the exact direction remains uncertain. Investors should prepare for both potential upward and downward scenarios. Q5: How can investors prepare for an impending Bitcoin price movement?

A recent announcement from Toronto-based investment firm Sol Strategy has certainly caught the attention of many, revealing ambitious plans for future SOL investments . This move highlights growing confidence in the Solana ecosystem and its underlying token. What’s Driving Sol Strategy’s Bold SOL Investments? Sol Strategy has publicly announced its intention to raise up to 25 million Canadian dollars, which translates to approximately $18 million USD, through a private placement. This substantial capital injection is earmarked for two primary purposes: strategic SOL investments and supporting general corporate operations. Currently, the firm already holds a considerable position, boasting around 390,000 SOL tokens. The decision to pursue such a significant raise specifically for SOL investments is not arbitrary. It reflects a calculated strategy to capitalize on Solana’s perceived growth potential and its position as a leading blockchain platform. Strategic Capital Allocation: The funds will allow Sol Strategy to increase its holdings in SOL, potentially at opportune market moments. Operational Backbone: A portion of the funds will also ensure the firm’s robust operational capacity, supporting its overall investment activities. The Strategic Advantages of Increasing SOL Investments Why are firms like Sol Strategy increasingly looking towards Solana? Solana has distinguished itself with its high transaction throughput, low fees, and a rapidly expanding ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), NFTs, and DeFi protocols. These attributes make it an attractive asset for long-term strategic SOL investments . For an investment firm, increasing exposure to a promising asset like SOL can offer several benefits: Growth Potential: Solana’s ongoing development and adoption suggest significant upside potential. Diversification: For traditional investment portfolios, exposure to high-growth digital assets like SOL can offer diversification benefits. Market Leadership: Solana continues to be a top contender in the smart contract platform space, attracting developers and users alike. Moreover, institutional participation often lends credibility and stability to a cryptocurrency, potentially attracting further mainstream interest. Navigating the Landscape of SOL Investments: Risks and Rewards While the prospects for SOL investments appear promising, it’s crucial to acknowledge the inherent volatility and risks associated with the cryptocurrency market. Like any investment, particularly in the digital asset space, SOL is subject to market fluctuations, regulatory changes, and technological developments. However, firms like Sol Strategy often employ sophisticated risk management strategies to mitigate these challenges. Their approach likely involves: Thorough Research: Deep analysis of Solana’s technology, market position, and competitive landscape. Long-Term Horizon: Focusing on the fundamental value and long-term growth trajectory rather than short-term price movements. Diversified Portfolio: While increasing SOL exposure, it’s likely part of a broader, diversified digital asset strategy. The balance between potential rewards and managing risks is a cornerstone of successful investment strategies in any market. How Does This Impact the Future of SOL and the Broader Market? Sol Strategy’s initiative to raise $18 million specifically for SOL investments sends a strong signal to the market. It suggests a belief in Solana’s enduring value and its role in the future of decentralized finance and web3. Such institutional backing can have several ripple effects: Firstly, it could inspire other institutional investors to consider or increase their own exposure to Solana. Secondly, increased demand from large funds can contribute to price stability and upward momentum for SOL. Lastly, it validates Solana’s technology and community, reinforcing its position as a major player in the blockchain arena. Ultimately, this development underscores a broader trend of institutional capital flowing into established and promising cryptocurrency projects. It highlights a maturing market where sophisticated players are actively seeking strategic positions. In conclusion, Sol Strategy’s plan to raise $18 million for strategic SOL investments is a significant vote of confidence in Solana. It reflects a calculated move to capitalize on the blockchain’s robust ecosystem and future potential. While the crypto market always carries risks, such institutional backing can be a powerful indicator of a project’s long-term viability and growth trajectory. This development will undoubtedly be watched closely by those interested in the evolving landscape of digital asset investments.

How much SOL does Sol Strategy currently hold? The firm currently holds approximately 390,000 SOL tokens, making this new fundraising a significant addition to its existing portfolio of SOL investments . What is a private placement in the context of this announcement? A private placement is a direct offering of securities to a limited number of sophisticated investors, rather than through a public offering. It allows companies to raise capital without the complexities of a public market listing. Why is Solana (SOL) considered an attractive investment? Solana is attractive due to its high transaction speed, low fees, and a rapidly growing ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), which positions it as a strong contender in the blockchain space for strategic SOL investments . What are the potential impacts of institutional SOL investments? Institutional SOL investments can lead to increased market credibility, potentially inspire other large investors, contribute to price stability and growth, and validate Solana’s technology and community.

A simple ‘gm’ (good morning) post on September 23rd immediately sent ripples through the market, causing a brief uptick in FTT’s price. However, the subsequent clarification from the Sam Bankman-Fried X account revealed a startling truth: it wasn’t the jailed FTX founder himself posting, but a friend acting on his behalf. This revelation sparks important questions about transparency, market manipulation, and the ongoing saga surrounding SBF. Who is Behind the Sam Bankman-Fried X Account Posts? The update on Tuesday clarified the situation surrounding the activity on the Sam Bankman-Fried X account . It explicitly stated that a friend, not Sam Bankman-Fried, is responsible for the messages. This means that while SBF remains incarcerated, someone close to him is managing his public social media presence. The ‘gm’ post: This simple greeting marked the account’s first activity in half a year. The clarification: A follow-up post confirmed the friend’s role, aiming to prevent misinterpretation. SBF’s legal status: Sam Bankman-Fried is currently jailed, facing numerous charges related to the collapse of FTX. The decision to have a friend post on his behalf raises ethical considerations. It highlights the complexities of maintaining a public persona, especially for individuals under severe legal scrutiny. The Immediate Impact of Sam Bankman-Fried X Account Activity The brief ‘gm’ post from the Sam Bankman-Fried X account had an almost immediate, albeit short-lived, effect on the market. FTT, the native token of the now-defunct FTX exchange, saw its price briefly boost. This reaction underscores the significant influence SBF’s name still holds in the crypto space, even from behind bars. Market reactions to such posts are often driven by speculation. Investors might interpret any activity from a high-profile figure’s account as a sign of impending news or a shift in their legal situation. Therefore, the clarification was crucial to manage expectations and prevent further speculative trading based on misleading information. This incident serves as a powerful reminder of how sensitive the crypto market can be to perceived signals, regardless of their actual substance. It also emphasizes the need for clear communication, especially from accounts associated with figures like the FTX founder. Navigating Social Media When Under Legal Scrutiny: Challenges and Insights Managing a public figure’s social media presence while they are incarcerated presents unique challenges. For the friend posting on the Sam Bankman-Fried X account , the line between personal communication and public statements becomes incredibly blurred. Transparency is paramount in such situations. Consider these actionable insights: Clear Disclosure: Always disclose who is posting on behalf of the account holder. This prevents speculation and builds trust. Content Strategy: Posts should be carefully considered to avoid any statements that could impact legal proceedings or mislead the public. Market Sensitivity: Be aware of how even seemingly innocuous posts can influence volatile markets like cryptocurrency. The saga of the Sam Bankman-Fried X account illustrates the delicate balance required when public figures face legal challenges. It is a testament to the enduring fascination with SBF and the profound impact his actions, and even perceived actions, continue to have on the crypto world. A Continuing Crypto Saga The recent activity on the Sam Bankman-Fried X account adds another layer to the complex narrative surrounding the former FTX CEO. It highlights the persistent influence of key figures in the crypto space and the rapid, often unpredictable, reactions of the market. This incident serves as a crucial reminder for all participants in the digital asset ecosystem to prioritize verified information and exercise caution when interpreting social media signals, especially from accounts with such a high profile and contentious history. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who is currently posting on Sam Bankman-Fried’s X account? A1: A friend of Sam Bankman-Fried is posting messages on his official X account on his behalf. Q2: Why did the ‘gm’ post from the Sam Bankman-Fried X account cause a market reaction? A2: The ‘gm’ post, being the first in six months from a high-profile figure, led to speculation among investors, briefly boosting the price of FTT, the native token of FTX. Q3: Is Sam Bankman-Fried able to access social media from jail? A3: The clarification indicates that Sam Bankman-Fried himself is not posting; his friend is managing the account. Access to external communications for jailed individuals is typically highly restricted. Q4: What are the ethical implications of someone posting on a jailed public figure’s social media? A4: Ethical implications include transparency concerns, potential for misleading the public or market, and ensuring that posts do not interfere with ongoing legal proceedings. Clear disclosure is vital. Q5: How can crypto investors avoid being misled by social media posts from influential figures? A5: Investors should always verify information from official and reputable sources, be skeptical of unconfirmed rumors, and understand that social media posts can be speculative or managed by third parties.

Then you need to pay close attention to a recent announcement. Binance has confirmed a temporary halt to Binance deposits and withdrawals for these two cryptocurrencies. This essential move supports upcoming network upgrades for both projects, ensuring the long-term health and efficiency of their respective blockchains. Why is Binance Temporarily Halting Binance Deposits and Withdrawals ? Binance’s decision to suspend these services is not a cause for alarm but rather a standard procedure. When a blockchain project undergoes a significant network upgrade, exchanges like Binance must ensure all systems are compatible and secure. This proactive measure prevents any potential issues with transactions during the upgrade period. Injective (INJ) Upgrade: The suspension for INJ will commence at 1:00 p.m. UTC on September 25. Moonriver (MOVR) Upgrade: For MOVR, the halt in services begins at 12:00 p.m. UTC on October 13. These temporary suspensions are crucial for the successful implementation of the upgrades, which often bring improved performance, enhanced security, and new functionalities to the networks.

They are similar to software updates for your computer or phone, bringing necessary improvements and bug fixes. For INJ and MOVR, these upgrades aim to bolster their infrastructure, potentially leading to faster transactions, lower fees, or new features for users and developers. While the temporary halt in Binance deposits and withdrawals might seem inconvenient, it is a small price to pay for a more robust and efficient network in the future. Binance ensures that your assets remain secure during this period. Trading of INJ and MOVR on Binance will continue as usual, only the ability to move funds in or out of the exchange is affected. Your Guide to Managing Binance Deposits and Withdrawals During This Period If you typically move INJ or MOVR frequently, planning ahead is key. It is advisable to complete any necessary deposits or withdrawals well before the announced suspension times. This ensures your transactions are processed smoothly without interruption. Here are some actionable insights for users: Plan Ahead: Mark the suspension dates for INJ (September 25) and MOVR (October 13) in your calendar. Asset Security: Rest assured, your INJ and MOVR assets held on Binance are safe and will be fully accounted for during and after the network upgrades. Trading Unaffected: You can continue to trade INJ and MOVR pairs on Binance throughout the suspension period. Only the transfer of assets into or out of your Binance account is paused. Binance’s support for these upgrades demonstrates its commitment to supporting the broader crypto ecosystem and ensuring a high-quality experience for its users. Anticipating the Resumption of Binance Deposits and Withdrawals Binance will reopen Binance deposits and withdrawals for INJ and MOVR once the respective network upgrades are complete and the networks are deemed stable. The exchange typically provides further announcements once services are fully restored. There is no need for users to take any additional action regarding the upgrades themselves, as Binance handles all technical requirements. These upgrades are a positive sign for both Injective and Moonriver, indicating active development and a commitment to innovation. Users can look forward to potentially enhanced network performance and reliability once these updates are fully implemented and services resume. In conclusion, the temporary suspension of Binance deposits and withdrawals for Injective (INJ) and Moonriver (MOVR) is a necessary step to facilitate crucial network upgrades. This move underscores Binance’s dedication to supporting blockchain innovation while safeguarding user assets. By understanding the scheduled dates and the reasons behind these suspensions, users can navigate this period with confidence, knowing that these upgrades pave the way for a more robust and efficient future for both INJ and MOVR.

Recently, a significant event has captured the attention of traders and investors alike: massive crypto liquidations . Over the past 24 hours, Ethereum (ETH) has unfortunately led this charge, seeing a staggering $43.7 million in liquidations across the perpetual futures market. This dramatic shift highlights the inherent volatility and risks present in highly leveraged trading. What Exactly Are Crypto Liquidations, and Why Do They Matter? If you’re new to the world of futures trading, understanding crypto liquidations is crucial. Essentially, a liquidation occurs when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a sudden price movement against their trade. This happens when the trader’s margin balance falls below the maintenance margin requirement, meaning they no longer have sufficient funds to keep the position open. It’s a mechanism designed to prevent traders from losing more money than they have in their account, but it can be a brutal experience for those caught on the wrong side of a market swing. The recent figures paint a clear picture of market turbulence: Ethereum (ETH): A colossal $43.71 million liquidated , with a majority (57.91%) being long positions. This indicates that many traders were betting on ETH’s price to rise, only to be met with a sharp downturn. Bitcoin (BTC): Not far behind, BTC saw $32.66 million liquidated . An even higher percentage (78.82%) of these were long positions, suggesting widespread optimism that quickly evaporated. Solana (SOL): This popular altcoin experienced $14.40 million liquidated , with long positions making up 58.2% of the total. These numbers aren’t just statistics; they represent significant financial losses for many participants. The dominance of long position liquidations across all three major cryptocurrencies suggests a broad market correction or a “long squeeze,” where cascading liquidations further fuel price declines. Why Did Ethereum Lead This Wave of Crypto Liquidations? While the exact catalysts for such widespread crypto liquidations can be complex, several factors often contribute. Market-wide sentiment, macroeconomic news, regulatory updates, or even large institutional trades can trigger significant price movements. When prices move sharply downwards, especially after a period of upward momentum, traders holding highly leveraged long positions are particularly vulnerable. Ethereum’s recent performance might have attracted a large number of optimistic leveraged bets, making it susceptible to leading the liquidation charts when the market turned. It’s a stark reminder that leverage amplifies both gains and losses. While it can accelerate profits during favorable market conditions, it can also lead to rapid and substantial capital depletion when the market moves unexpectedly. Understanding the inherent risks associated with leveraged trading is paramount for anyone venturing into the perpetual futures market. Navigating Volatility: What Can Traders Learn from Recent Crypto Liquidations? The recent surge in crypto liquidations offers valuable lessons for traders. Firstly, risk management is not just a suggestion; it’s a necessity. Implementing stop-loss orders, avoiding excessive leverage, and diversifying portfolios can help mitigate potential losses. Secondly, market sentiment can shift quickly. Relying solely on upward trends without considering potential reversals can be perilous. Always be prepared for volatility and have a strategy for managing adverse price movements. For those looking to engage with perpetual futures, here are some actionable insights: Start Small: Begin with smaller position sizes to understand market dynamics without risking significant capital. Set Clear Limits: Always use stop-loss orders to define your maximum acceptable loss per trade. Manage Leverage: While tempting, high leverage significantly increases liquidation risk. Use it judiciously, if at all. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on market news, technical indicators, and overall economic sentiment. The cryptocurrency market, with its 24/7 nature, demands constant vigilance. These significant liquidation events, while painful for some, serve as crucial reminders of the importance of disciplined trading practices and robust risk management strategies. A Resilient Market Amidst the Turbulence Despite the significant crypto liquidations , the cryptocurrency market often demonstrates remarkable resilience. While individual traders may face losses, the underlying technology and innovation continue to evolve. These periods of correction can also present opportunities for long-term investors to accumulate assets at more favorable prices, provided they have a strong conviction in the asset’s future. In conclusion, the past 24 hours have been a harsh lesson in market volatility, with Ethereum at the forefront of substantial crypto liquidations . This event underscores the critical need for prudent risk management, especially when engaging in leveraged trading. As the crypto landscape continues to mature, understanding and adapting to these market dynamics will be key to sustainable participation. Frequently Asked Questions About Crypto Liquidations Q1: What is a crypto liquidation? A1: A crypto liquidation occurs when an exchange automatically closes a trader’s leveraged position because their margin balance falls below a required level, typically due to a significant price movement against their trade. It prevents further losses beyond the initial margin. Q2: Why did Ethereum (ETH) lead the recent liquidations? A2: Ethereum likely led due to a combination of factors, including its significant market capitalization, high trading volume in perpetual futures, and potentially a large number of highly leveraged long positions that were caught off guard by a price downturn. Q3: What’s the difference between long and short liquidations? A3: A long liquidation happens when a trader betting on a price increase (a “long” position) has their position closed because the price drops. A short liquidation occurs when a trader betting on a price decrease (a “short” position) has their position closed because the price rises. Q4: How can traders protect themselves from crypto liquidations? A4: Traders can protect themselves by using prudent risk management strategies such as setting stop-loss orders, avoiding excessive leverage, managing position sizes, and diversifying their portfolios. Staying informed about market trends is also crucial. Q5: Do crypto liquidations affect the overall market? A5: Yes, large-scale crypto liquidations can amplify market movements. When many leveraged positions are closed simultaneously, it can create cascading sell-offs (in the case of long liquidations) or buy-ins (for short liquidations), contributing to increased volatility and price swings.

A truly exciting development is underway as Swarm, a prominent DeFi platform, prepares to launch tokenized stocks on the Plasma mainnet. This groundbreaking move is set to revolutionize how investors access shares of major companies like Apple, Tesla, and Microsoft, all powered by stablecoins. What Are Tokenized Stocks and Why Are They a Game Changer? Imagine owning a piece of your favorite company, not through a traditional brokerage, but as a digital token on a blockchain. That’s precisely what tokenized stocks are. They are blockchain-based tokens that represent traditional equity shares, offering a bridge between the regulated world of traditional finance and the innovative realm of decentralized digital assets. Fractional Ownership: Investors can buy fractions of high-value shares. Increased Accessibility: Lower entry barriers for global investors. 24/7 Trading: Unlike traditional markets, blockchain operates continuously. This innovation promises to democratize investment opportunities, making it easier for individuals worldwide to participate in markets previously restricted by geographical or financial constraints. Swarm’s Vision: Democratizing Access to Tokenized Stocks Swarm is taking a significant step by introducing nine prominent tokenized stocks . This initial offering includes shares from industry giants such as Apple, Microsoft, Tesla, Coinbase, and Nvidia. The platform leverages the Plasma mainnet, a robust and scalable infrastructure, to facilitate these trades. Users will be able to acquire and trade these digital shares directly using stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to the value of fiat currencies like the US dollar. This integration provides stability and ease of transaction, avoiding the volatility often associated with other cryptocurrencies. By using stablecoins, Swarm aims to provide a more predictable trading environment for those new to the crypto space, making the transition into digital asset ownership smoother and more appealing. The Plasma mainnet ensures efficient and secure processing of these transactions. Navigating the Trading Landscape: How to Engage with Swarm’s Tokenized Stocks Engaging with Swarm’s new offering is designed to be user-friendly, yet it’s essential to understand the underlying mechanics. The Plasma mainnet provides the secure and scalable foundation for these digital assets. This means that once you acquire tokenized stocks , your ownership is recorded on a transparent and immutable blockchain ledger. Users will interact with Swarm’s platform to manage their portfolio, place trades, and settle transactions. The entire process aims for efficiency and transparency, characteristic of well-designed DeFi applications. Understanding the platform’s interface and the basics of stablecoin transactions will be key for a seamless experience. Exploring the Potential and Pitfalls of This New Frontier for Tokenized Stocks The launch of tokenized stocks by Swarm brings immense potential, but also introduces new considerations for investors. Potential Benefits: Global Reach: Break down geographical barriers to investment. Lower Fees: Potentially reduced transaction costs compared to traditional brokers. Increased Liquidity: The 24/7 nature of crypto markets can lead to more consistent trading opportunities. Potential Pitfalls: Regulatory Clarity: The regulatory landscape for tokenized stocks is still evolving, which can introduce uncertainty. Platform Risk: Reliance on the security and stability of the Swarm platform and Plasma mainnet. Education Gap: New users may need to learn about blockchain technology and DeFi concepts. Investors should conduct thorough research and understand these factors before participating. While the benefits are compelling, a cautious approach is always recommended in emerging markets. The Future Unlocked: How Tokenized Stocks Could Reshape Investing Swarm’s initiative with tokenized stocks represents more than just a new product; it’s a glimpse into the future of finance. By merging traditional equity markets with blockchain technology, Swarm is paving the way for a more inclusive, efficient, and transparent investment ecosystem. This could inspire other platforms to follow suit, leading to a broader adoption of digital assets for real-world value. For individuals, this means unprecedented access to investment opportunities. For the financial industry, it signals a shift towards decentralized models that prioritize user empowerment and innovation. As the DeFi space continues to mature, we can expect to see even more sophisticated financial instruments becoming accessible through blockchain technology. In conclusion, Swarm’s launch of tokenized stocks on the Plasma mainnet is a significant milestone for the DeFi sector. By offering fractional, stablecoin-based trading of major company shares, Swarm is not only expanding investment accessibility but also pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in decentralized finance. This development holds immense promise for investors seeking new avenues and for the ongoing evolution of global financial markets.

The scheme builds on the agency’s “ crypto sprint ” to implement the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets report recommendations. “For years I have said that collateral management is the ‘killer app’ for stablecoins in markets. Today, we are finally moving forward on the work of the CFTC’s Global Markets Advisory Committee from last year.” The public feedback window is open until October 20, and the submissions will be published on the agency website. Major Stablecoin Players Back CFTC Initiative Some of the stablecoin heavyweights, including Circle, Ripple and Tether, have lauded the CFTC’s move. Circle President Heath Tarbert said that the initiative will lower costs, reduce risk, and unlock liquidity across global markets round the clock. If implemented, stablecoins such as Circle’s USDC and Tether’s USDT would receive equal attention as traditional collaterals like cash. Further, the US GENIUS Act, which has been a turning point for regulation , has reshaped stablecoin strategy, quickly becoming the sector’s defining edge. Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether said that stablecoins, nearly $300 billion global market, have become “a core building block of modern finance, by enabling faster settlement, deeper liquidity, and greater market resilience.” “The decision to recognize stablecoins as part of U.S. market infrastructure is an important step toward strengthening the US’s leadership in global finance and in ensuring its markets remain competitive.” Cody Carbone, CEO of Digital Chamber said that the CFTC directive is “the kind of forward-looking stuff that makes US markets stronger, safer, and competitive.” Great move by @CFTCpham This is the kind of forward-looking stuff that makes US markets stronger, safer, and competitive.

Related Reading: Analyst Says Ethereum Bounce Is Imminent As BitMine Continues To Accumulate First Australia-Based Solana Treasury On Tuesday, Nasdaq-listed Fitell Corporation, a global provider of fitness equipment and health solutions, unveiled the launch of the first Solana-based digital asset treasury in Australia. According to the announcement, the company has secured a $100 million convertible note facility with a US-based institutional investor to support the launch of its SOL treasury strategy. Notably, $10 million from the initial closing will be immediately deployed to purchase the altcoin. Following the launch of the Treasury, Fitell plans to rebrand to “Solana Australia Corporation.” Additionally, it has initiated steps for a dual listing on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). The DAT is expected to generate yields by deploying SOL assets across a “diversified suite of on-chain DeFi and derivatives strategies,” including structured products such as options, snowballs, on-chain liquidity provisioning, and other highly liquid strategies with managed downside risk. Meanwhile, returns generated will be reinvested into the treasury reserve, the company explained. Cailen Sullivan, one of Fitell’s advisors, affirmed that their strategy “focuses not only on Solana itself, but the broader ecosystem of applications being built on top.” “By deploying more assets on-chain, we aim to generate outsized returns, setting a new benchmark for performance in digital asset management while supporting the growth of DeFi applications on Solana,” Sullivan added. SOL Corporate Adoption Continues Fitell Corporation’s CEO, Sam Lu, expressed the company’s ambition to become the largest publicly listed SOL holder in Australia and the Asia Pacific regions: The launch of our Solana digital asset treasury positions Fitell at the forefront of Solana adoption in the regions of Australia and Asia Pacific. (…) With the expertise of David Swaney and Cailen Sullivan, we are excited to execute on a roadmap that combines innovation, yield generation, and disciplined risk management. This initiative follows the recent push for Solana-focused DATs, which have seen hundreds of millions of dollars invested in the strategies this month. Last week, neurotech company Helius Medical Technology revealed the launch of a $500 million SOL treasury strategy backed by Pantera Capital and Summer Capital. The Pennsylvania-based company announced the first purchase for its DAT strategy on Monday, adding 760,190 SOL, worth approximately $168 million, at an average purchase price of $231. Similarly, Nasdaq-listed Forward Industries Inc. has unveiled its plan to bring its equity to the blockchain. According to the announcement, the company has partnered with financial technology firm Superstate to allow stockholders to tokenize and hold FORD shares on the Solana blockchain. Related Reading: CEO Dismisses September Crash, Reveals Why The Bitcoin Price Is Headed For $150,000 Forward Industries Inc. is currently the largest corporate SOL Treasury, successfully closing a $1.65 billion private investment in public equity (PIPE) earlier this month to purchase the cryptocurrency, stake it, and generate excess returns. Bitwise’s CIO Matt Hougan suggested that strong corporate treasury purchases and the highly anticipated approval of spot SOL exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could start a “Solana Season” in the coming months.

Alexis Sirkia, Captain of the Yellow Network, believes the launch of Ripple USD (RLUSD) and the first U.S.-based XRP ETFs could reignite transaction volume on XRPL. RLUSD-XRP Synergy Fuels Liquidity and Adoption Sharing his views with CryptoPotato , Sirkia outlined the changing digital asset landscape, focusing on integration and the institutional adoption of XRP. He believes RLUSD is not a competitor to XRP, but rather a liquidity amplifier: “This is not a zero-sum dynamic where RLUSD sidelines XRP, but about developing synergy,” said the executive. The stablecoin’s integration into U.S. banking infrastructure positions it as a compliant settlement layer for institutions, which he said could enhance liquidity and adoption on the XRPL. He explained that this is because it creates a feedback loop where increased RLUSD activity drives greater demand for XRP as a bridge currency. For instance, RLUSD has already been deployed in African markets via Chipper Cash and Yellow Card, and is being used for real-time swaps with tokenized money market funds. The debut of the first U.S. XRP ETFs, including the REX-Osprey XRP ETF (XRPR) and ProShares Ultra XRP ETF , has been a turning point in XRP’s institutional accessibility. Sirkia describes these launches as more than investment vehicles: “it’s a strong signal of growing regulatory acceptance, opening a clearer pathway for XRP, an asset long focused on cross-border utility and compliance.” Is XRP About to Rebound? XRP has experienced a notable decline in on-chain activity throughout September, with daily payments on the XRPL falling more than 75% to 223,000. Active addresses also plunged from 581,000 in June to just 31,000 by end of the month. The decline has been compounded by whale sell-offs, and a slip below the $3.00 mark. However, Sirkia said that the recent developments should be viewed as part of a wider altcoin market dip instead of a weakness in the XRPL itself. He explained that with institutional adoption through ETFs and the integration of RLUSD picking up, transaction volumes are likely to rebound quickly, reinforcing the cryptocurrency’s role as a bridge between traditional finance and DeFi. According to him, the real measure of any digital asset’s longevity doesn’t lie in its market cap, but in its ability to deliver seamless, scalable, and interconnected liquidity across financial ecosystems. Yellow Network is a new, unique layer-three protocol and SDK, backed by Ripple Co-Founder Chris Larsen, that is about to undertake its TGE. It provides the core infrastructure and developer tools to power a new generation of high-performance decentralized finance applications.

The price is now showing bearish signs and might decline again below the $2.780 zone. XRP price is moving lower below the $2.90 support zone. The price is now trading below $2.880 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.90 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it dips below $2.780. XRP Price At Risk of Another Decline XRP price failed to stay above the $3.00 pivot level and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price dipped below the $2.920 and $2.90 support levels. The bears even pushed the price below $2.80. A low was formed near the $2.678 support, and the price recently started a recovery wave. There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $3.138 swing high to the $2.678 low. However, the bears are active near the $2.90 resistance. The price is now trading below $2.90 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Besides, there is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.90 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.880 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.90 level and the trend line. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $3.138 swing high to the $2.678 low. A clear move above the $2.90 resistance might send the price toward the $2.950 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $3.00 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $3.120. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.90 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.780 level. The next major support is near the $2.7150 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.7150 level, the price might continue to decline toward $2.650. The next major support sits near the $2.60 zone, below which the price could gain bearish momentum. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $2.780 and $2.7150.
