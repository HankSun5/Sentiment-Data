SEC Chair Paul Atkins Says He Has His “Hands Full” According to the September 23 X post published on the official Mornings with Maria account, Atkins pushed back on the idea that the two agencies would merge, saying that he has his “hands full right now.” SEC chairman wants ordinary Americans in private markets: ‘Make IPOs great again’ pic.twitter.com/m2KiX1vSrM — Mornings with Maria (@MorningsMaria) September 23, 2025 “We’re working hand in glove with the CFTC right now, so compartmentalization is what I really envision,” Atkins said. “People have been discussing these issues for a long time, and we’re at a point now, especially when we look at the changes in the digital asset area, that it’s really incumbent on the two agencies to work hand in glove.” However, Atkins did admit that the SEC has been looking at “issues with respect to the crypto area,” alongside the CFTC, with the former SEC commissioner affirming that the “American public will benefit from a joint effort by the two agencies.” CFTC, SEC Prepare for Highly-Anticipated Roundtable News of the CFTC and SEC’s rumored merger comes ahead of the agencies’ joint roundtable next Monday, September 29. According to the SEC’s website , the roundtable will serve as “an opportunity to discuss regulatory harmonization priorities” and will be open to the public. “It is a new day at the SEC and the CFTC, and today we begin a long-awaited journey to provide markets the clarity they deserve,” Atkins and CFTC Acting Chairman Caroline D. Pham said in a September 5 statement. “By working in lockstep, our two agencies can harness our nation’s unique regulatory structure into a source of strength for market participants, investors, and all Americans,” they added. However, exactly how the two agencies will address potential overlapping blockchain jurisdictions remains to be determined.

Just last month, Bitcoin hit a new record high of $124,128. It has since pulled back 9%. However, the Fed’s recent interest rate cuts, along with a flurry of spot altcoin ETF application verdicts due next month, could light the spark on a 2025/2026 bull run. Regulators are also stepping up their pace. In July, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act, the first sweeping U.S. federal law targeting stablecoins, which requires issuers to maintain full reserve backing. Shortly after, the SEC unveiled Project Crypto, designed to modernize securities law and create clearer rules for companies working in the digital asset space. All things considered, the next rally in altcoins will surpass the gold rush of 2021, guided by clearer regulations. If Claude AI’s forecast proves accurate, XRP, Dogecoin, and Pi Network will lead the charge. XRP (Ripple): Claude AI Predicts a Surge of 700%+ Toward $24 According to Claude AI, Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could climb as high as $24 by the end of 2025, a potential gain of more than 739% from its current level around $2.86. XRP has already demonstrated notable strength this cycle. On July 18, it touched $3.65, eclipsing its 2018 peak of $3.40, before retreating by about 21.5% amid broader macroeconomic pressures. Ripple’s global payments ecosystem continues to expand, gaining recognition from major organizations. In 2024, the UN Capital Development Fund endorsed XRP as a low-cost remittance option for developing economies. The resolution of Ripple’s lengthy legal standoff with the SEC in early 2025 cleared one of the biggest overhangs for the token. The regulator officially dropped its lawsuit following a 2023 ruling that retail XRP sales do not meet the definition of securities. Claude AI suggests that if XRP retests and holds its July highs, a move toward $4 to $5 is achievable, with a strong bull case scenario highlighting a run up to anywhere between $7 and $24. The appearance of three bullish flags across XRP’s support and resistance lines over the last year sets up the potential for a rapid breakout in the final quarter. Despite recent Fed rate cuts and the approval of the first spot XRP ETF , markets remain cautious, likely awaiting the SEC’s upcoming decisions on additional ETF applications expected next month, alongside the rollout of comprehensive crypto legislation. Over the past year, XRP has surged 389%, quintupling Bitcoin’s 78% gains, and 7x growth compared with Ethereum’s 58.5% price appreciation over the same period. Dogecoin ($DOGE): Claude AI Expects a Push Beyond $1 for the Meme Coin Pioneer Dogecoin ($DOGE) , which began in 2013 as a joke currency, has grown into a top-10 crypto with a market cap of about $36.3 billion, making up nearly half of the $78.1 billion meme coin sector. Its longevity comes from a passionate community and a steadily increasing role in payments. While DOGE often mirrors Bitcoin’s price movements, its strong liquidity and grassroots following have allowed it to survive multiple downturns. Now priced around $0.2386, Dogecoin has more than doubled in the past year, outperforming Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Shiba Inu, and Pepe. Chart analysts point to repeating bullish falling wedge patterns seen from November through April, and again in mid-summer, suggesting the potential for further major upside pending good industry developments. Dogecoin is likely to face some resistance on the way up at the $0.45 band. However, should it slip, it will have firm support at $0.30. Claude AI’s base case sees DOGE reaching $0.33 by December, with the higher-end target of $1.50 representing a massive 530% rally from current prices. That would also fulfill the “Doge Army’s” long-standing dream of $1 per coin, a psychological milestone that eluded the project during its 2021 all-time high of $0.7316. Real-world adoption is also increasing: Tesla accepts DOGE for merchandise purchases, while platforms like PayPal and Revolut have integrated Dogecoin into their payment ecosystems. Pi Network ($PI): Claude AI Projects Explosive Growth for Tap-to-Mine Coin Pi Network ($PI) has attracted attention with its mobile “tap-to-mine” system, allowing users to earn tokens simply by opening the app and tapping once a day. Currently trading near $0.2731 Claude AI forecasts a potentially aggressive scenario where the token could rise to $50 by year’s end, an astonishing 180× increase. While that outcome may be overly optimistic under current market conditions, the project’s roadmap provides some justification for bullish sentiment. The development team is steadily advancing, with version 23 and a possible mainnet launch expected soon, events that could add fresh momentum. Since debuting in February 2025, Pi Network has shown extreme volatility, including a 171% surge in May. Its RSI now sits at 26, which means it is greatly undervalued right now, so investors that believe in its premise can see this as a prime dip-buying opportunity. Most analysts, however, remain more cautious, seeing a return to February’s $2.99 peak as a strong but unrealistic goal. Even if the ultra-bullish case does not play out, October has historically been a favorable month for crypto, leaving room for doubling, in accordance with Claude’s base case optimistic scenario, or potentially up to $5. Maxi Doge (MAXI): A High-Risk Meme Coin Play For investors seeking more speculative bets outside Claude AI’s primary picks, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) markets itself as the “degenerate cousin” of Dogecoin, embracing volatility and meme culture as part of its brand identity. While Dogecoin has matured into a mainstream digital asset, Maxi Doge is leaning into its risk-on appeal. The presale has already raised over $2.4 million in just its first month. Launched as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, MAXI is focused on viral growth through Telegram and Discord engagement, trading competitions, and partnerships with other projects. Of the 150.24 billion tokens minted, roughly 25% are allocated to the “Maxi Fund,” designed to fund marketing and collaborations. Staking is currently live with yields of 136% APY, though these rates are expected to decline as more users stake. The presale price is currently $0.0002585, with the nominal price hikes scheduled as the presale moves through its funding rounds. Investors can participate through the official Maxi Doge website using MetaMask or Best Wallet . Stay updated through Maxi Doge’s official X and Telegram pages.

52166475,https://cryptonews.com/?p=427060,1758666600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/52166475.jpeg,"Best Crypto to Buy 23 September – XRP, Shiba Inu, Pepe",https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-23-september-xrp-shiba-inu-pepe/,"With countless cryptocurrencies to choose from in a burgeoning $4 trillion market, determining which one offers the best crypto buying opportunity right now can be overwhelming Bitcoin sailed to a new record high of $124,128 just last month. Additionally, the space is diversifying, and enthusiasm remains strong for major altcoins and the best meme coins . Over the past year, numerous tokens have reached fresh highs, reflecting rising optimism within the crypto market. Much of this renewed momentum can be linked to two major policy shifts in Washington. First, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act, the first sweeping U.S. regulation focused on stablecoins. Second, the SEC unveiled Project Crypto, an initiative to update and clarify how securities laws apply to digital assets. As sentiment improves, it’s worth examining how key altcoins such as XRP, Shiba Inu, and Pepe are today’s best dip buying opportunities to prepare for the next bull run. Ripple ($XRP): Cross-Border Payments Leader and Blue-Chip Crypto for 2025 Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) climbed to an all-time high (ATH) of $3.65 on July 18, the same day the GENIUS Act became law, surpassing its 2018 peak of $3.40. Since then, it has eased back to around $2.86, about 21.5% off its recent historic peak. The token’s competitive edge comes from enabling low-cost, fast cross-border payments, offering a modern alternative to traditional networks such as SWIFT. This role has been reinforced by support from groups like the UN Capital Development Fund and even acknowledgment from the White House. Ripple’s influence in the policy arena was also evident when CEO Brad Garlinghouse joined a high-profile White House roundtable on crypto regulation earlier this year. With the launch of the dollar-pegged RLUSD, Ripple has also positioned itself to take significant market share from the stablecoin sector. Momentum accelerated in 2023 after a U.S. court ruled XRP’s retail sales were not securities, effectively ending a five-year clash with the SEC and delivering a milestone win for the broader industry. In the past 12 months, XRP has soared 389%, quintupling Bitcoin’s 78% gains. Following July’s rally, the token found strong support at $3, although with the arrival of September, a month where crypto typically underperforms, it has slipped beneath that threshold. Currently, XRP’s relative strength index (RSI) sits near 42 and may be reversing its course. The Fed’s recent rate cuts and the greenlighting of the first spot XRP ETF failed to unleash a full-scale XRP rall,y but many argue that it was expected and already priced in beforehand. Looking forward, the SEC is expected to rule on additional spot XRP ETFs in mid-October, a decision that could lift the token above $4 within weeks. Shiba Inu ($SHIB): Meme Coin Powerhouse Expanding Into Utility Debuting in August 2020, Shiba Inu ($SHIB) has grown into the second-largest meme coin, boasting a market cap of over $7.2 billion. In the last 24 hours, SHIB’s value rose 1%, outperforming the broader $78.1 billion meme coin sector, which crashed 7%. Considering that the overall $4 trillion crypto market also rose 1% overnight, SHIB’s relatively stable price action, alongside its large market cap and expanding use cases, makes it trade more like a blue-chip crypto than a typical meme coin. It currently sits around $0.0000122. Chart analysis suggests further potential upside. Over the last year, SHIB has developed two bullish formations: a descending wedge between November and March and a flag pattern since May. Breaking through resistance at $0.000022 could pave the way toward $0.00003 by late October. In a stronger bull market, projections range from $0.00006 to $0.00009 by year’s end. Unlike most meme coins, SHIB has tangible applications. These include Shibarium, an Ethereum-based Layer-2 designed to lower fees and speed up transactions, along with privacy-focused tools that broaden its utility. Pepe ($PEPE): Meme Icon With Breakout Potential Launched in April 2023, Pepe ($PEPE) quickly became one of the top meme coins by market cap, driven by the cultural appeal of Matt Furie’s iconic frog character in his webcomic Boy’s Club . Its explosive growth led to many imitators, though none matched its success. With a market cap above $4 billion, Pepe has attracted attention the world over, even briefly cameoing as Elon Musk’s X profile picture. Currently priced near $0.000009689, PEPE’s price remains virtually unchanged in the last 24 hours, highlighting its resilience. However, it’s still 65% below its all-time high of $0.00002803 set in late 2024. However, crypto markets typically strengthen in October, and should “Uptober” materialize, meme coin fervour could mean Pepe is challenging its former high by November. With its RSI at about 40 and downtrending, PEPE is in the midst of a sell-off that could further discount prices during the working week, providing a small window of a dip buying opportunity. Supporters argue that improving macro conditions and growing investor confidence could help propel PEPE to new highs this summer. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): A Cutting-Edge Bitcoin Layer 2 Presale for 2025 Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is quickly becoming one of the standout presales of 2025, aiming to introduce the first Bitcoin Layer 2 that combines viral meme appeal with scalability and decentralized governance. The project’s goal is to expand Bitcoin’s utility by enabling faster payments, smart contracts, and community-led decision-making. The presale has already raised approximately $17.7 million, with some analysts predicting gains of 10× or more after launch. Powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER offers high-speed smart contracts with minimal transaction costs. One of its key features is the Canonical Bridge, which enables near-instant Bitcoin transfers on its Layer 2 while supporting dApps, meme tokens, and payment processing at very low fees. A recent Coinsult audit reported no vulnerabilities, strengthening investor confidence. The $HYPER token serves multiple functions within the ecosystem, from staking and transaction fees to governance rights. Early presale buyers can earn staking rewards of up to 66% APY, along with voting rights once the platform is live.

Some tokens have rebounded strongly in the past 24 hours, with yesterday’s Metaplanet purchase of 5,419 BTC being the major driver of renewed optimism. It’s in this context that the immediate prospects for XRP, Solana and Cardano have improved, with all three coins likely to rally as the week progresses. We also consider where they might be heading towards the end of the year, which could bring a bull rally if the SEC approves most outstanding ETF applications. Crypto Price Prediction: XRP ($XRP) – Oversold Technicals and Incoming ETFs Could Mean New ATH in Q4 XRP has bounced by 2% in the past 24 hours, recovering from its 24-hour low of $2.80 to return to $2.87. However, this current level still means that the altcoin has dropped by 4% in a week and by 5% in a month, making for a disappointing August and September for the market’s fourth-biggest token. Yet as the chart below illustrates, XRP’s recent underperformance (which follows the wider market’s underperformance) has put it in an oversold position, meaning that it should bounce back very soon. For instance, its relative strength index (yellow) dropped below 50 a few days ago, having spent much of August and September in a weak position. Source: TradingView And with the same thing applying to XRP’s MACD (orange, blue), it’s likely that the altcoin will make a concerted recovery soon. Its fundamentals also point in this direction, in that the SEC could approve upwards of ten XRP ETFs in the next few weeks. The approval of most or even a few such ETFs could result in a big influx of institutional money, pushing the XRP price upwards as we approach the festive season. This is why the crypto price prediction for XRP is so bullish right now, and when you add Ripple’s ongoing growth as a cross-border payments firm, we could see the coin hit $5 by December. Crypto Price Prediction: Solana ($SOL) – Institutional Investment Will Enable SOL to Explode Soon At $220, Solana is down by 1% in a day and by 6.5% in a week, although it has posted a 6% gain in the last 30 days. It’s also up by 50% in the past year, a percentage which marks steady if unspectacular annual growth. Yet if Solana’s annual growth hasn’t been spectacular, then the picture could very easily change over the next few weeks. Forward Industries Raises $1.65B for Solana Treasury Strategy Backed by Galaxy, Jump, Multicoin Forward Industries has announced a $1.65 billion private placement in cash and stablecoin commitments through a private investment in public equity (PIPE) round led by Galaxy… — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 12, 2025 As with XRP, this is because SOL is also waiting on the SEC to approve several spot-based Solana ETFs, which again could boost the coin’s market massively. At the same time, Solana has been enjoying some very positive developments and news in recent weeks, including the growth in public companies accumulating the coin as a reserve asset. For instance, the Galaxy Digital-backed Forward Industries has been buying $1.65 billion in SOL, making it the largest publicly listed holder of the token. Source: TradingView Such pieces of news mean that Solana has been faring better than other major tokens this month, yet it’s still far from reaching its full potential or being overbought. Because of this, we could expect the coin to reach $250 by the middle of October, $350 by the end of November, and then $500 by the end of the year. Crypto Price Prediction: Cardano ($ADA) – L1 Growth and Whale Transfers Point to Big Moves Cardano has posted a modest rise to $0.8257 today, although it does remain down by 4.5% in a week and by 9% in a month. On the other hand, it still boasts a decent 130% increase in a year, underlining its potential as an under-appreciated altcoin. In fact, ADA remains down by 73% in relation to its ATH of $3.09, which it set way back in September 2021. This means that it’s way overdue a big rally, and given Cardano’s fundamentals as a major layer-one blockchain, such a rally is likely to come sooner or later. We can see below that its RSI has been struggling to break into higher readings for several weeks now, increasing the odds of such a move. Source: TradingView We have also seen some massive transfers involving unknown whale wallets in the past couple of days, heightening the sense that something major is about to happen for ADA. And given that Cardano is a top-20 blockchain in terms of TVL , and that it continues to grow steadily , we could see big moves towards. There’s also the fact that ADA is also waiting on one ETF application, so its crypto price prediction could also turn hyper-bullish soon. We could see it reach $1 in early October , before closing the year at around $2.50 . Mine-to-Earn Coin PEPENODE Raises $1.3 Million in Presale: Next Big Play? The three coins above are all in great positions to climb vigorously in the final quarter of the year, yet they won’t be the only tokens to post strong returns as we approach 2026. Indeed, traders should also consider diversifying into one of the numerous presale coins that are currently available, with some of these showing the potential to rally hard once they list. One of the best examples of this is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), an ERC-20 token that has now raised just over $1.3 million in its ongoing sale. The PEPENODE presale is live. Buy Nodes. Build Your Server Room. Combine Nodes For Huge Bonuses. Do it all here https://t.co/d1JAronqiv pic.twitter.com/60uLhEoukP — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) September 10, 2025 What makes PEPENODE special is that it’s the market’s first-ever mine-to-earn token, providing holders with the ability to build their own virtual mining rigs and earn mining rewards. By spending PEPENODE on acquiring virtual nodes, users can increase their mining rewards, which will include other meme tokens, such as Fartcoin and PEPE. This comes on top of staking rewards paid out in PEPENODE itself, giving investors lots of incentive to acquire more of the coin. As such, the token could experience huge demand once it lists in the next few weeks, giving it the opportunity to become one of the next big meme coins. Investors can join the sale and buy it early on the PEPENODE website . Just connect a compatible wallet (such as Best Wallet ) and make the payment using crypto or a credit/debit card. It’s currently selling at $0.0010702, although investors should move quickly, since this price will continue to rise throughout the sale.

For those tracking the digital frontier, including the dynamic cryptocurrency space, the foundational infrastructure supporting these advancements is just as crucial as the breakthroughs themselves. Imagine the sheer computational muscle required to power the next generation of AI models, the kind that could redefine industries and even human interaction. This is precisely what OpenAI is gearing up for, embarking on an ambitious journey to construct a network of colossal AI data centers known as Project Stargate. This massive undertaking, backed by industry giants Oracle and SoftBank, signals a new era in AI development, promising to reshape the technological landscape as we know it. What is Project Stargate and Why Does it Matter? Project Stargate is not just another data center initiative; it’s a vision for a supercomputing backbone designed to meet the insatiable demands of advanced AI. At its core, Stargate represents OpenAI ‘s commitment to pushing the boundaries of artificial general intelligence (AGI). The sheer scale of this project is astounding, with a planned capacity of seven gigawatts. To put that into perspective, seven gigawatts is enough energy to power more than five million homes. This monumental energy requirement underscores the immense computational needs of training and deploying increasingly complex AI models, from large language models to advanced generative AI. For anyone invested in the future of technology, understanding the infrastructure behind AI breakthroughs is key. Stargate isn’t just about housing servers; it’s about creating an ecosystem where AI can truly flourish, enabling faster training times, more sophisticated algorithms, and ultimately, more powerful and versatile AI applications. The implications of such a project are far-reaching: Accelerated AI Development: With vastly increased computational power, OpenAI can iterate on models more rapidly, leading to quicker advancements. New Capabilities: More powerful infrastructure enables the development of AI models with capabilities previously deemed impossible. Economic Impact: The construction and operation of these facilities will create jobs, stimulate local economies, and attract further investment in tech hubs. Global Competitiveness: Such infrastructure solidifies the position of the United States as a leader in AI innovation. The Power Players: Oracle , SoftBank , and OpenAI ‘s Strategic Alliance The success of an undertaking as grand as Project Stargate hinges on strategic partnerships. OpenAI has meticulously chosen its collaborators, tapping into the strengths of two industry titans: Oracle and SoftBank . These alliances are not merely financial; they represent a confluence of technological expertise, global reach, and a shared vision for the future of AI. Oracle ‘s Cloud Computing Prowess Oracle , a long-standing giant in enterprise software and cloud infrastructure, brings its robust cloud computing capabilities and expertise in building and managing large-scale data centers. Three of the five new Stargate sites are being developed in collaboration with Oracle, leveraging their Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) platform. OCI is known for its high performance, scalability, and security, making it an ideal foundation for demanding AI workloads. Oracle’s commitment to supporting cutting-edge AI initiatives aligns perfectly with OpenAI ‘s goals, providing the necessary hardware, network, and operational excellence to handle the unprecedented data flows and processing power required. This partnership signifies Oracle’s aggressive push into the AI infrastructure market, positioning them as a critical enabler for the next wave of AI innovation. SoftBank ‘s Visionary Investment and Global Reach SoftBank , the Japanese multinational conglomerate known for its extensive investments in technology and telecommunications, is partnering with OpenAI on the remaining two Stargate sites. SoftBank’s involvement is strategic, providing not only significant capital but also its vast network and experience in large-scale infrastructure projects. SoftBank’s vision often involves identifying and nurturing disruptive technologies, and its investment in Stargate underscores the firm’s belief in the transformative power of AI. Their global perspective and ability to mobilize resources across diverse sectors will be invaluable in navigating the complexities of such a massive buildout. This collaboration highlights a shared understanding that foundational infrastructure is paramount for unlocking AI’s full potential. The synergy between these three entities is undeniable: OpenAI: The AI innovator, driving the demand for advanced compute. Oracle: The infrastructure provider, offering scalable and high-performance cloud solutions. SoftBank: The strategic investor and enabler, providing capital and global project expertise. Unpacking the Scale: The Immense Need for AI Data Centers The rapid evolution of AI models, particularly large language models (LLMs) and generative AI, has created an insatiable demand for computational resources. Training these models requires vast amounts of data and billions of parameters, necessitating an unprecedented scale of hardware and energy. This is where the concept of ‘gigawatt-scale’ AI data centers becomes critical. The existing infrastructure, while powerful, simply isn’t sufficient to handle the future needs of AI development. Consider these factors driving the demand: Model Complexity: AI models are growing exponentially in size and complexity, requiring more processing power and memory. Data Volume: Training data sets are enormous, demanding massive storage and high-speed data transfer capabilities. Inference at Scale: Once trained, these models need to serve millions of users, requiring efficient and powerful inference capabilities. Continuous Innovation: The pace of AI research means constant experimentation and retraining, which consumes vast resources. The $100 billion investment from Nvidia, mentioned in the original report, further illustrates this point. This capital is earmarked specifically for acquiring Nvidia’s cutting-edge AI processors – the very chips that power these advanced models – and building out even more AI data centers. It’s a clear signal that the race for AI dominance is fundamentally a race for computational infrastructure. Companies like OpenAI understand that without robust, scalable, and energy-efficient data centers, the theoretical advancements in AI cannot translate into practical, impactful applications. Geographic Footprint: Where are OpenAI ‘s New Hubs Located? The strategic placement of these new AI data centers is crucial for operational efficiency, energy access, and disaster recovery. OpenAI ‘s expansion includes five new sites across the United States, carefully selected for their potential to support such large-scale operations. Here’s a breakdown of the announced locations: Partner Location Notes Oracle Shackelford County, Texas Leveraging Texas’s energy resources and growing tech infrastructure. Oracle Doña Ana County, New Mexico Strategic location in the Southwest, potentially benefiting from renewable energy initiatives. Oracle Undisclosed location in the Midwest Likely chosen for access to power grids and potentially cooler climates for efficient cooling. SoftBank Lordstown, Ohio Utilizing existing industrial sites and energy infrastructure in the region. SoftBank Milam County, Texas Another significant presence in Texas, highlighting its strategic importance for data center development. These locations are not chosen at random. Factors such as access to reliable and affordable power, fiber optic networks, skilled labor, and favorable regulatory environments play a significant role. Texas, for instance, has become a hotbed for data center development due to its energy grid and pro-business environment. The expansion into the Midwest and Southwest also suggests a strategy of geographical diversification, reducing risks associated with localized natural disasters or energy disruptions. This distributed approach ensures redundancy and resilience, critical for maintaining continuous AI operations. Fueling the Future: The Economic and Technological Impact of Stargate The construction of these new Stargate data centers is more than just an infrastructure project; it’s an investment in the future of technology itself. The economic impact will be substantial, from the creation of thousands of construction and operational jobs to stimulating local economies in the chosen regions. Beyond direct economic benefits, the technological implications are profound. For the broader tech ecosystem, including areas like blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi), the advancements enabled by Stargate could lead to: More Sophisticated AI Tools: Enhanced AI capabilities could improve fraud detection, predictive analytics, and algorithmic trading in financial markets. Improved Security: AI can play a critical role in cybersecurity, protecting digital assets and infrastructure. Innovation in Web3: Advanced AI could power more intelligent smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and user experiences in the Web3 space. Energy Considerations: The immense power consumption of these centers also brings a focus on sustainable energy solutions, a conversation relevant to all high-energy-consumption industries, including cryptocurrency mining. The challenges are also significant. The sheer energy demand of seven gigawatts raises environmental concerns, pushing for innovations in renewable energy sources and energy efficiency. Cooling these massive facilities efficiently will be another engineering feat. However, the benefits of accelerating AI development are seen as outweighing these challenges, driving further investment in green tech and sustainable practices within the data center industry. Conclusion: A New Dawn for AI Infrastructure OpenAI ‘s Stargate project, backed by the formidable resources of Oracle and SoftBank , marks a pivotal moment in the history of artificial intelligence. By committing to build five new gigawatt-scale AI data centers , OpenAI is not just expanding its capacity; it is laying the groundwork for the next generation of AI innovation. This monumental undertaking will provide the computational horsepower necessary to train and deploy models that could redefine industries, from healthcare and finance to education and entertainment. While challenges like energy consumption and environmental impact remain, the strategic partnerships and massive investment underscore a collective belief in the transformative power of AI. As these Stargate hubs come online, they will not only solidify OpenAI ‘s leadership but also accelerate the entire AI ecosystem, promising a future where intelligent machines play an even more integrated and sophisticated role in our lives.

The former CEO of the exchange took to his X account to protest the reports that have made the rounds since earlier today. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) has pushed back against a recent Financial Times report about YZi Labs, a crypto investment firm linked to his fortune. CZ described the report as “complete false news” and stated that it was filled with “fake, wrong, or made-up info.” In a series of posts on X, CZ said that the publication misrepresented YZi’s operations, his role, and even his past regulatory case, while promoting what he called “negative narratives.” CZ pushes back on “false narratives” The FT article portrayed YZi Labs , which was founded in January 2025 and led by former Binance executive Ella Zhang, as one of the world’s largest crypto investors managing Zhao’s wealth. It also reported that the fund is exploring ways to raise funds from outside investors. Zhao, however, denied nearly every element of that framing. In his posts, CZ accused FT of publishing inaccuracies without his participation. “Complete false news from FT, with fake/wrong/made-up info and negative narratives. This is just from what I gathered on social media, I did not even read the FT article. No subscription,” he wrote . CZ then went ahead to list a series of clarifications about YZi Labs. He clarified that the company is not raising external fundraising, does not have a demo or a pitch deck and that there has never been a plan for one. Clearing up rumors In his post, CZ made it clear that YZiLabs, since rebranding, has not sought a single external investor. “No requests, no discussions,” he wrote. He also denied being in communication with the former SEC Commissioner, Paul Atkins, who is now the Chair of the Commission, despite FT reporting otherwise. “I do respect Chairman Atkins tremendously, just from all the public info I see,” CZ added, but maintained there had been no engagement. Zhao also stressed that YZi Labs was not “spun out of Binance,” as reported. He stated that the company is operating independently, disputing the idea that it functions as an extension of his former exchange. The Binance founder also defended his past brush with the U.S. legal system, which was mentioned in the report. “I plead to a single violation of BSA, failure to maintain an adequate ANTI-money laundering program. Contrary to what FT characterized as ‘money laundering’ violations,” he wrote. “Failure to police is not the same as stealing. Two very different things that the traditional media keeps on intentionally mixing up.” CZ mentioned in his post that he had been invited by FT for a lunch interview with assurances of “positive coverage,” but declined at the last minute. “It was a trap! Cancelling that lunch now,” he wrote, before signing off with the remark: “Ethics… 4.” Your crypto news deserves attention - KEY Difference Wire puts you on 250+ top sites",News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|BNB|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-23 22:38:44

The incident involved hackers who took advantage of a vulnerability in the project’s multi-signature wallet that let them gain admin rights. Details of the Breach Blockchain security firm CyversAlerts alerted the community to the breach via an X post, noting that it had detected $11.3 million in suspicious transactions involving the web3 social project. Their analysis reveals that the hacker used an Ethereum address to carry out a “delegateCall,” stripped away the admin role, and installed a new owner with special permissions. They proceeded to move the funds, including $4 million in USDT, $500,000 in USDC, 3.7 WBTC, and 25 ETH. The stolen USDT and USDC were then converted to DAI on Ethereum, while USDT on Arbitrum was swapped to ETH and bridged back to the former. Not long after, a second address linked to the attack received 10 million UXLINK tokens worth around $3 million, with some already being traded. UXLINK later confirmed the incident on X, stating, “We have identified a security breach involving our multi-signature wallet, resulting in a significant amount of cryptocurrency being illicitly transferred to both CEXs and DEXs.” The company said it was working with internal and external security experts to identify the cause of the hack and contain the damage. It added that major platforms had been contacted to freeze suspicious UXLINK deposits, with coordination underway to stop further fund transfers. The case has also been forwarded to law enforcement and other authorities to speed up legal action and recovery efforts. UXLINK Plunges by Over 70% Despite intervention from exchanges such as Upbit, the exploit has severely impacted the token’s supply. In an update, the crypto project disclosed that the hacker had started minting UXLINK tokens. PeckShieldAlert noted that between 1 and 2 billion were created on Arbitrum, nearly doubling the token’s circulating supply. Roughly 490 million of these were dumped across DEXs and CEXs, causing a sharp sell-off. UXLINK’s price dropped by more than 70%, sliding from $0.30 to roughly $0.09, and wiping out around $70 million in market capitalization. Although Upbit reportedly froze $5–7 million worth of assets, most of the stolen funds, converted into 6,732 ETH valued at $28.1 million, remain under the attacker’s control. In an interesting twist, the exploiters also later fell victim to a scam by the Inferno Drainer group, losing over 542 million stolen tokens. UXLINK has since announced plans for a token swap to restore supply integrity and compensate affected holders. Further instructions will be issued through its official accounts.

As recent reports highlighted on Tuesday, this ambitious financial maneuver could position Tether alongside some of the most prominent private enterprises, including OpenAI, which was valued at $300 billion during its recent fundraising round. Tether Explores Fundraising Options The transaction would reportedly involve offering new equity rather than existing shareholders selling their stakes. Sources familiar with the situation told Bloomberg that discussions are still in the preliminary stages, meaning the specifics of the deal, including the total amount raised, could evolve over time.

On Monday, her firm Ark Investment Management bought Alibaba shares through two of its ETFs. The total value? About $16.3 million, according to Ark’s daily trading report. This isn’t some small blip. On Tuesday, Alibaba’s U.S.-traded ADRs hit levels not seen since November 2021. The stock has nearly doubled in 2025 alone. Traders are betting hard on its new AI strategy to turn things around, as its main e-commerce business keeps losing ground to rising players like PDD Holdings. Pinduoduo and Temu have been ripping into Alibaba’s market share. Ark ramps up China tech positions again Cathie first jumped into Alibaba in 2014, right after the company’s IPO. SEC records show steady involvement, until everything stopped cold in September 2021. That’s when Beijing’s regulatory crackdown hit Chinese internet firms hard. After that, there was no trace of Ark voting or trading activity tied to Alibaba. The silence lasted four years. But Monday’s buy looks like a full re-entry. It’s also not isolated. Ark also bought more shares of Baidu on the same day, pushing that position up to $47 million, according to the filings. That move follows earlier 2025 purchases in Baidu, making it clear Ark’s betting again on China’s tech sector. Ark still holds smaller stakes in other China-related names: BYD , Pony AI, and JD Logistics. Those are there, but tiny compared to Alibaba and Baidu. Cathie’s been famous for going after future tech bets. Her main fund, ARKK, is up 49% this year, beating both the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500. But zoom out, and it’s still down over the last five years. And while 2025 has been hot, the fund’s bled out $438 million in investor cash so far this year, based on Bloomberg data. This latest Alibaba move could be Cathie trying to pivot back into sectors she’d avoided since China’s tech meltdown. It also ties into her wider strategy of stacking up AI-focused bets, just as Wall Street’s obsession with artificial intelligence reaches fever pitch. And with Alibaba shifting its focus away from just e-commerce and deeper into machine learning, it fits her pattern. “AI is the next big wave of innovation,” Cathie’s team wrote in a recent update. “Companies leading in this space could see exponential growth.” She’s not alone in that thinking, but her timing is bold. Everyone’s watching to see if this $16.3 million buy-in is the start of a full comeback for Ark’s China exposure—or just a trade. Either way, Alibaba is back in her portfolio.

The meme coin has slipped 11% since the weekend amid a market-wide liquidation event, but the broader narrative continues to support optimism into Q4. Cooling September inflation has strengthened the case for continued rate cuts, though today’s Fed meeting will be pivotal in setting the tone. With markets pricing in another 0.50% of easing before year-end , there is a strong backbone for an explosive run, stimulating demand for risk assets like DOGE. At the same time, Dogecoin is deepening its foothold in U.S. TradFi markets with a second spot ETF approval via 21Shares, adding another touch point for demand.

Yet, momentum indicators suggest early reversal signs. The RSI has steadied at 40 after a sharp pullback from near-overbought levels, signaling easing sell pressure. The MACD histogram shows a similar shift, flattening into what could mark a local bottom for the Dogecoin price. If buyers mount another retest of the channel’s upper boundary, the fuel of ETF adoption and continued macro easing could create a breakout setup. Fully realized, the pattern would eye a return to Dogecoin’s all-time high at $0.48 for a 100% gain , opening the doors to new price discovery. A continued 3 70% move to the $1 milestone , however, will likely hinge on long-term adoption through ETFs and corporate treasury integration, embedding DOGE deeper into U.S. financial markets. The Next Bull Run Could See A Different Doge Coin Go Parabolic With this bullish setup, Dogecoin continues to demonstrate a trend: the strongest social momentum lies with doge-branded tokens. Dogecoin sparked the movement in 2021, followed by Shiba Inu, Floki, Bonk, Dogwifhat, Neiro, and most recently Dowge. The pattern is clear: doge-themed coins drive the biggest waves of social momentum. This time, speculators have their eyes on Maxi Doge ($MAXI) as the next to take off. Maxi Doge presale website.

Since 2021, officials say they targeted 203 people who failed to pay local levies. Of those, crypto from 161 individuals was already frozen or taken, with the city estimating the recovered value at about 1.5 billion won (roughly $1.1 million). City Opens Exchange Account According to city statements, Cheongju created a trading account on a domestic crypto exchange to make seizure and conversion easier. The change matters because it lets officials not only freeze assets but also sell them and apply the proceeds to overdue tax bills. Officials told reporters they now have a clearer path to turn crypto holdings into cash for tax recovery. How The Seizures Are Carried Out Reports describe a multi-step process. Tax offices identify residents with unpaid bills. They then request information from exchanges to see whether those people hold virtual assets. When ownership is confirmed, exchanges are ordered to suspend transactions or to transfer the assets to the municipal account. If the taxpayer does not settle the debt, the city may liquidate the holdings and use the proceeds to cover what is owed. Other Local Governments Have Taken Similar Steps Several other South Korean cities and districts have used similar tactics. Jeju City investigated 2,962 people for unpaid taxes and found 49 of them holding crypto worth about 230 million won. Jeju’s wider unpaid-tax list totaled about 19.7 billion won. Gwacheon, in Gyeonggi Province, built an “electronic virtual asset seizing system” and has recovered roughly 300 million won over recent years, targeting residents who owe more than three million won in local taxes. Paju sent notices to 17 people who owed about 124 million won and has previously seized around 100 million won in similar cases. Implications And Concerns The moves underline how local governments are pressing exchanges for data and exercising legal powers to collect taxes. Some citizens and observers worry about transparency and due process. Questions include how quickly exchanges must act, whether taxpayers receive fair notice, and how volatility is handled when assets are sold. Reports also note growing use of data tools, including AI, by some cities to find undeclared holdings. City Officials Say They Want Compliance Based on reports, city leaders framed the actions as an effort to stop tax evasion through virtual assets. They have warned residents that cryptocurrency cannot be used to hide from tax obligations. Still, legal challenges could arise, and appeals from affected residents may push some cases into the courts.

The company aims to raise $550 million through a mix of PIPE financing and equity-linked products, with the goal of accumulating more than $700 million worth of AVAX tokens. Supported by Hivemind Capital and more than 50 institutions, including Galaxy Digital and Kraken, the move establishes Avalanche as a major player in institutional-grade blockchain adoption. SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci has also joined as an advisor, highlighting growing Wall Street confidence in Avalanche’s role in the asset tokenization revolution. Technical Outlook: AVAX Bulls Defend Key Levels From a technical perspective, AVAX has broken through key resistance levels while remaining stable above its $32–$34 support zone. The token moves within an ascending channel, supported by the 20-day EMA at $30.43, with all major moving averages signaling bullish momentum. The RSI hovers around 71, suggesting slightly overbought conditions, but momentum indicators remain strong. Analysts identify $37 as the next key resistance level. A breakout could unlock higher targets at $40 and eventually $47–$50, aligning with liquidity maps that mark this zone as a major supply area. Tokenization Momentum and On-Chain Data Avalanche’s bullish case is further supported by its growing ecosystem. On-chain flows indicate net inflows of $3.26 million on September 23, signaling renewed accumulation. Futures open interest has also increased to nearly $1.8 billion, highlighting strong leveraged demand. Meanwhile, Avalanche’s growing role in tokenization, already tested by global players like Apollo and JPMorgan, provides a fundamental tailwind. With ETF filings underway and AVAX One’s treasury build-up reducing circulating supply, the long-term trajectory appears robust.

Experts had expected a reading of 51.1. Germany gains while France slips Fresh data revealed a sharp split between the region’s two largest economies. Germany showed strong improvement, while France struggled with ongoing political troubles that hurt business confidence. “The composite PMI for manufacturing and the service sector in the euro area rose slightly again in September. It thus continued its slight upward trend,” said Ralph Solveen at Commerzbank. “The improvement in recent months is solely attributable to a rise in the German index, while there are no signs of improvement in the other countries.” Germany’s PMI jumped to a 16-month peak of 52.4, beating predictions that called for a small increase to 50.6 from 50.5. But France told a different story – activity shrank for the thirteenth month running and at the quickest rate since April, with its PMI dropping to 48.4. “From a country perspective, France stands out negatively. The PMI dropped to the lowest level since April, with declines in both manufacturing and services,” said Bert Colijn at ING. “That stands in contrast to Germany, where services activity picked up according to the PMI. With heightened political uncertainty, the French economy appears to be mirroring this sense of instability.” Last week, hundreds of thousands of people joined protests across France against budget cuts. The demonstrators wanted the previous government’s spending plans thrown out, more money for public services, higher taxes on rich people, and changes to an unpopular rule that makes people work longer before they can retire. In Britain, which left the European Union, companies said they felt less confident and things were slowing down. They worried about possible new taxes in finance minister Rachel Reeves’ budget coming in November. The British PMI also showed fewer people getting hired. Service companies drove the eurozone’s overall growth The services PMI went up to 51.4 from 50.5 in August – the best reading in nine months and much better than experts thought, who predicted no change at all. But manufacturing moved in the wrong direction. That sector’s main number fell into shrinking territory at 49.5 from 50.7 in August. Job numbers stayed flat in September, ending six months of new hiring as companies reacted to the lack of new business coming in. Factories kept cutting workers, while service companies hired people at the slowest pace in seven months. Signs point to little chance of a quick turnaround. The measure that tracks new business orders – which shows demand – fell to exactly 50.0 from 50.3. Price pressures got weaker during the month. Both the costs companies pay and the prices they charge customers went up more slowly than before. Manufacturing companies saw their costs go down for the first time in three months. Service firms still faced high price increases, but not as steep as before, and they raised their own prices at the weakest rate since May. “The services output price PMI – which policymakers might watch particularly closely as a guide to domestic price pressures – declined to 52.7, leaving it only a touch above its 2019 average of 52.4,” said Jack Allen-Reynolds at Capital Economics. The European Central Bank kept interest rates the same earlier this month. Another survey suggests the bank has finished cutting rates for now. The mixed picture shows the eurozone economy growing but facing headwinds. While Germany’s strength helped lift overall numbers, France’s struggles and weak demand across the region raise questions about how long this modest expansion can last.

Confidence in institutional adoption grew this week after Morgan Stanley confirmed it will add crypto trading via Zerohash to its E*Trade platform starting in late 2026. Users will gain direct access to Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and Solana (SOL), marking a significant step toward mainstream integration. Morgan Stanley is partnering with cryptocurrency infrastructure provider Zerohash to let E*Trade clients trade popular coins beginning in the first half of next year https://t.co/t7ibOCdHW5 — Bloomberg (@business) September 23, 2025 This particular move positions Morgan Stanley against rivals like Charles Schwab and Robinhood, both of which already offer crypto-linked products. With Bitcoin representing around $2.25 trillion of the market’s $3.9 trillion value, Wall Street’s deeper involvement highlights how integral digital assets have become to global finance. Morgan Stanley’s E*Trade crypto launch set for late 2026 Access to Bitcoin, Ether, and Solana at rollout Wall Street competition intensifies with Schwab, Robinhood BlackRock’s ETF Profits Fuel Optimism BlackRock’s booming ETF business is also reinforcing institutional confidence. According to Onchain Foundation’s Leon Waidmann, BlackRock’s Bitcoin and Ether ETFs are now generating $260 million in annual revenue, including $218 million from Bitcoin products alone. The firm’s Bitcoin ETF has nearly $85 billion in assets under management, making it one of the largest globally, even compared to traditional funds.

Analysts argue these products could anchor BTC in retirement portfolios, potentially fueling a run toward $200,000 by year’s end if momentum continues. SEC Exemption Could Unlock Growth Adding to the bullish backdrop, SEC Chair Paul Atkins signaled plans for a crypto “innovation exemption” by December 2025. This initiative, part of Project Crypto, aims to reduce regulatory friction and modernize securities laws. Potential exemptions could include ICOs, airdrops, and network incentives—opening the door for more ETFs and structured crypto products. Atkins stressed that the U.S. must aim to become the global leader in digital asset innovation. Traders welcomed the announcement, with Bitcoin stabilizing around $111,000 as regulatory clarity boosted confidence. Bitcoin Technical Forecast: Eyes on $110K On the technical front, Bitcoin price prediction in the near term remains cautious. The breakdown below $115,000 pushed the price under both the 50-EMA ($114,300) and 200-EMA ($114,100), flipping them into resistance. The chart shows a base forming near $112,000, with long lower wicks hinting at dip-buying, although momentum is weak, with the RSI at 38. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Failure to defend $112,000 could expose $110,850, then $108,750. Deeper selling might drag BTC to $107,250. Conversely, a recovery above $113,450 would open the path to $114,750–$116,150, and potentially retest $118,000. While short-term participants may remain defensive, the broader uptrend of higher lows since summer is intact. If institutional inflows accelerate and macro liquidity gets better, Bitcoin could stage a rebound toward $120,000, framing this pullback as a long-term accumulation opportunity. Presale Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Combines BTC Security With Solana Speed Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). Its goal is to expand the BTC ecosystem by enabling lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation.

Calderon, 39, announced his candidacy on Tuesday in a video posted to social media, where he emphasized the need for a “new generation of leadership” to tackle California’s affordability crisis. It’s time for a new generation of leadership in California. pic.twitter.com/WmXIJcC1j1 — Ian Calderon (@IanCalderon) September 23, 2025 Calderon Brings Pro-Bitcoin Agenda to Crowded California Democratic Primary Calderon is no stranger to politics. First elected to the Assembly in 2012 to represent District 57 in Los Angeles County, he later served as Assembly Majority Leader from 2016 to 2020. He chose not to seek reelection in 2020, citing a desire to spend more time with his young family, and went on to launch lobbying firm Majority Advisors, where he has been CEO. His candidacy also extends the legacy of a political family with deep ties to Sacramento. His father, Charles Calderon, held seats in both the Assembly and Senate, while his uncles Ron and Tom also served in the legislature. His stepmother, Lisa Calderon, now represents the same district he once did. What distinguishes Calderon’s campaign is his open endorsement of Bitcoin. In his first post to X following the announcement, he declared his vision for California to become “the undisputed leader on Bitcoin,” a message he also reiterated in his campaign video. California has always been a leader on technology. It's time for us to get back to our roots and make California the undisputed leader on Bitcoin. — Ian Calderon (@IanCalderon) September 23, 2025 His position builds on earlier efforts during his time in office, when he explored the potential for Bitcoin integration at the state level, despite constitutional limits on states recognizing legal tender. The announcement comes as California, home to major crypto firms such as Coinbase, continues to play a pivotal role in shaping national tech and financial policy. Calderon’s pro-crypto stance could attract donations from Silicon Valley and the broader digital asset community, potentially giving him an edge in campaign financing. His entry further complicates the race to replace Governor Gavin Newsom, who cannot run again in 2026. Other Democratic contenders already in the field include former U.S. Representative Katie Porter, former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, Los Angeles’ former mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, state senator Toni Atkins, and Diamond Resorts founder Stephen Cloobeck. For Bitcoin, Calderon’s candidacy indicates how digital assets are moving into mainstream political debates. While his campaign faces a competitive field, his pro-Bitcoin platform ensures cryptocurrency will remain part of California’s 2026 gubernatorial conversation. California Pushes Digital Asset Adoption With New Laws and Pilot Programs California is advancing a sweeping framework for digital assets, positioning itself alongside New York as a key regulatory state. Governor Gavin Newsom signed the Digital Financial Assets Law (DFAL) last year , a licensing regime set to take effect in July 2025. The law requires all individuals and firms offering crypto services in the state to obtain a license from the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI), with strict obligations for audits, record-keeping, and consumer safeguards. Noncompliant firms risk enforcement actions. The DFPI has been given 18 months to implement the law, which is widely viewed as California’s equivalent to New York’s BitLicense. License holders will be required to keep financial records for at least five years, including detailed monthly ledgers of assets and liabilities. California Assembly unanimously approves crypto payments bill. AB-1180 now heads to the Senate. #crypto #California https://t.co/HCk96E5CxN — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 4, 2025 Lawmakers have also advanced complementary legislation. In June, the Assembly unanimously approved AB 1180 , creating a pilot program for paying state fees with digital assets. The program will run until 2031 and requires DFPI to submit a detailed report by 2028 on transaction volumes, challenges, and potential broader adoption. California just passed AB 1052 (78–0), shielding unclaimed crypto from automatic liquidation. #CryptoLaw #AB1052 https://t.co/Pyz8k3Xn1Z — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 5, 2025 Separately, AB 1052 was approved to update unclaimed property laws , ensuring dormant cryptocurrencies held by custodians are preserved in their native form rather than liquidated.

The Brazilian media outlet Livecoins reported that the BCB has released a public consultation paper calling for feedback on its proposals. Forex Rules: Crypto Exchanges to Feel Effect? These proposals focus mainly on Forex platforms, known as eFX in Brazil (short for electronic foreign exchange). In fact, the bank did not make any direct reference to crypto exchanges in its proposals, nor to crypto transactions. But, in their current form, the rules would impact crypto exchange platforms that allow their customers to make international transfers or sell coins for fiats other than the Brazilian real. The BCB is keen to move the largely unregulated Forex industry under its supervisory umbrella. Its proposals include forcing existing and new Forex providers to apply for regulatory permits. Forex platforms would also have to submit data on their clients’ transactions and use designated on/off ramps for client withdrawals and deposits. Furthermore, the proposals advocated capping individual transactions at a value equivalent to $10,000. And the BCB wants to oblige forex platforms to boost their transparency criteria, displaying the real and full cost to customers of each individual transaction they make. Crypto exchanges that allow their customers to make transfers to international accounts “may also be affected,” the media outlet warned. The rules would also have an impact on crypto exchanges that operate from outside Brazil, with traders also potentially limited by $10,000 transaction caps. Source: Ariadne ariadnerb Crypto’s Rising LATAM Appeal The outlet noted that the proposals “do not address” investment functions on eFX platforms, but instead focus “only on currency transactions.” The consultation period runs until November 2, the bank wrote in its document.

Harald, who had been absent from XRP discussions for several months, returned with a bullish comment suggesting that the digital asset may soon attempt a significant upward move, potentially toward the $4 range. His statement has reignited speculation within the community, with several other analysts adding their own perspectives. Market Overview XRP has been consolidating around the $3 level for several weeks, with price movements showing limited momentum in either direction. At the start of the week, the token fell to $2.77 before recovering slightly to $2.82. This performance follows a retreat from a recent swing high of $3.66, reached two months ago, after which the asset lost roughly 25% of its value. As of report time, XRP is trading at $2.86. Market participants have noted that the prolonged stagnation near $3 could soon give way to a breakout. To reach $4 from current levels, XRP would need to advance by more than 42%. Such a move would establish a new all-time high, as the token has not traded above $3.84 since 2018. When Harry speaks I listen XRP $4.00 https://t.co/0Bpfx0cnjH — Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL) September 21, 2025 Harald’s recent comment, shared on social media over the weekend, was his first public statement on XRP since May. His reentry into the conversation drew considerable attention from the community, with prominent influencer Alex Cobb remarking that Harald’s views hold weight and indicating that he sees $4 as the next logical target. Technical Indicators Suggest Rebound Other analysts have supported this bullish outlook through technical analysis. Market strategist Ali Martinez highlighted that XRP’s four-hour chart has issued a TD Sequential buy signal, an indicator often associated with the conclusion of a downtrend after several consecutive lower closes. Martinez suggested this may mark a favorable entry point for buyers. In addition, legal expert and XRP supporter Bill Morgan cited data from Grok AI that demonstrates the TD Sequential’s reliability. According to Grok’s analysis, the indicator has historically shown 60–70% accuracy on higher timeframes. Notably, three out of four buy signals on the two-week chart since 2022 have led to substantial rallies. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Independent trader Unipcs also noted structural improvements in XRP’s chart. According to him, the asset broke a key downtrend line after reaching a low of $2.69 on September 1. Although he does not personally hold XRP, he emphasized that the technical setup favors further gains, making it difficult to maintain a bearish stance. Similarly, analyst Gonzo pointed to XRP’s ability to stay above both the 50% Fibonacci retracement level and the 50-day moving average, describing these as positive signs for continued upward momentum. Fundamental Drivers and ETF Speculation Beyond technical analysis, optimism is also being fueled by potential fundamental catalysts. Growing speculation around the possibility of a U.S.-listed XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) has created enthusiasm among investors. Reports suggest that a decision from the Securities and Exchange Commission could arrive as soon as next month. If approved, many analysts believe the introduction of such a product would attract significant institutional capital into the market, providing strong support for a potential price surge. With XRP consolidating near $3 for an extended period, anticipation is mounting over its next directional move. Harald’s positive projection, combined with technical indicators and renewed ETF speculation, has strengthened the case for a possible advance toward $4 . While market conditions remain uncertain, analysts generally agree that the current environment makes it increasingly difficult to justify a bearish outlook on XRP.

Businesses ranging from online gaming firms to golf cart makers changed their strategies to purchase cryptocurrencies just two months ago. Now these same companies are trying to boost their falling stock prices through share buybacks. Some are even taking on debt to pay for these stock purchases. Seven companies have made these moves in recent weeks. Five of them now have stock values lower than what their cryptocurrency holdings are worth. Investors are getting worried about too many companies doing the same thing and questioning whether this business approach actually works. “It’s probably the death rattle for a few of these companies,” said Adam Morgan McCarthy, who works as a senior research analyst at Kaiko, a company that studies cryptocurrency data. On Monday, Vivek Ramaswamy’s investment firm Strive Asset Management purchased Semler Scientific. This healthcare technology company had switched to collecting bitcoin. This deal shows how companies trading below their crypto values are becoming targets for takeovers. This year, dozens of companies rushed to borrow money or sell new shares to raise cash for buying cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ether, and Solana. Some of these companies have backing from President Donald Trump and his family members. They followed the example of Michael Saylor, a well-known crypto investor. His company MicroStrategy saw its value climb above $100 billion this year after it started buying bitcoin in 2020. Crypto treasury companies are losing money Most crypto treasury companies are losing money or are basically empty shell companies. The only thing driving their stock prices up is executives and investors believing their digital tokens will gain value. A biotech firm called 180 Life Sciences renamed itself ETHZilla last month and started buying ether tokens. Its stock has dropped 76 percent from its August high point. The company is worth $416 million, even though it owns about $460 million worth of ether. Last week, ETHZilla borrowed $80 million using its ether holdings as collateral from Cumberland DRW, the crypto division of market maker DRW run by Don Wilson. The company plans to use this money to buy its own shares as part of a $250 million buyback program. “We continue to view repurchasing shares as opportunistic and an accretive use of capital,” said McAndrew Rudisill, who serves as ETHZilla’s chief executive. However, some experts think these buybacks show the crypto treasury business model might be finished. “It’s only been six months and we’re already talking about their demise,” said Elliot Chun, a partner at crypto advisory firm Architect Partners. “A very small percentage are going to succeed.” Chun explained that raising money to buy back shares instead of spending it on tokens goes against the whole crypto treasury idea. Public companies have been doing more share buybacks in recent years. Company leaders usually do this when they think their stock is undervalued. Real estate investment trusts often buy their own shares when their market value drops below what their properties are worth. But crypto treasury companies built their business on the idea that their stock value would rise faster than their crypto holdings. For companies now doing buybacks, this is not happening anymore. Morgan McCarthy from Kaiko said the companies are “just trying to buy time, sustain things, tide things over until they can capitalize on that next wave of crypto prices rising.” “It’s very circular,” he said about these buyback operations. “A lot of these companies are like a house of cards and are going to collapse very quickly.” If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

We’re talking about the phenomenal rise of Ethereum spot ETFs , which have rapidly carved out a significant slice of the total spot ETH trading volume. This isn’t just a minor trend; it’s a powerful indicator of how traditional finance is embracing digital assets. An Unprecedented Surge: Why Are Ethereum Spot ETFs Dominating? Just last November, Ethereum spot ETFs accounted for a mere 3% of the total spot ETH trading volume. Fast forward to today, and that figure has skyrocketed to an impressive 15%. This five-fold increase, as reported by The Block, highlights a clear preference emerging among investors. But what’s driving this unprecedented surge? The primary reason boils down to accessibility, security, and regulation. Many investors, particularly those coming from traditional financial backgrounds, are increasingly opting for regulated financial products over the complexities of directly managing cryptocurrencies. These ETFs offer a bridge, allowing exposure to Ethereum without the intricacies often associated with digital asset ownership. The Compelling Benefits of Investing via Ethereum Spot ETFs Investing in Ethereum spot ETFs presents several compelling advantages that resonate with a broad spectrum of investors: Simplified Exposure: Investors can gain exposure to ETH’s price movements without the need to set up and manage their own digital wallets, remember seed phrases, or navigate complex crypto exchanges. This significantly lowers the barrier to entry. Enhanced Security: By investing through an ETF, investors delegate the security responsibilities to professional custodians. This mitigates personal security risks, such as potential hacks or loss of private keys, which can be a major concern for direct token holders. Regulatory Assurance: ETFs operate within established financial frameworks, providing a layer of regulatory oversight that many traditional finance participants find reassuring. This trust factor is crucial for attracting larger institutional capital. Market Liquidity: The growth of these ETFs contributes to the overall liquidity of the Ethereum market, making it easier for investors to buy and sell their positions. Moreover, the influx of capital into these regulated products has had a tangible impact on the market. Ethereum (ETH) itself has seen a price increase of over 30% this year, partly fueled by the growing interest and investment channeled through these ETFs. This demonstrates the significant influence that regulated financial instruments can have on the underlying digital asset. What Does the Future Hold for Ethereum Spot ETFs? The trajectory for Ethereum spot ETFs appears set for continued expansion. As traditional financial infrastructure further integrates digital assets, we can expect the market share of these ETFs to grow even more. This ongoing integration is likely to pave the way for more sophisticated financial products and broader investor participation. However, it’s also important to acknowledge potential challenges. The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally, and future policy decisions could influence the growth trajectory. Market volatility, a hallmark of the crypto space, will also remain a factor for investors to consider. Despite these considerations, the current trend suggests a strong and enduring preference for regulated exposure to digital assets. The remarkable growth of Ethereum spot ETFs is not just a statistic; it’s a testament to the maturation of the crypto market and its increasing appeal to a wider investment audience. It signifies a pivotal moment where ease of access, security, and institutional trust are becoming paramount. This remarkable shift underscores the increasing confidence in Ethereum as a foundational asset within the digital economy. The continued evolution of these financial instruments will undoubtedly shape the future of crypto investment, making it more accessible and secure for everyone. Frequently Asked Questions About Ethereum Spot ETFs What are Ethereum spot ETFs? Ethereum spot ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) are investment vehicles that hold actual Ethereum (ETH) as their underlying asset. They allow investors to gain exposure to ETH’s price movements without directly owning or managing the cryptocurrency themselves. How do Ethereum spot ETFs differ from holding ETH directly?

This simplifies the investment process and reduces personal security risks, offering a more traditional investment experience. Who is investing in Ethereum spot ETFs? Both institutional and retail investors are showing a strong preference for Ethereum spot ETFs . Institutions appreciate the regulatory compliance and ease of integration into existing portfolios, while retail investors benefit from simplified access and reduced security concerns. What impact have Ethereum spot ETFs had on ETH’s price? The increased inflows into these ETFs have contributed to a positive sentiment and demand for Ethereum. The Block reported that ETH’s price has risen by more than 30% this year, partly attributed to the growing interest channeled through these regulated products. What is the future outlook for Ethereum spot ETFs? The outlook is largely positive. As traditional financial infrastructure continues to integrate digital assets, the market share of Ethereum spot ETFs is expected to grow further. This trend suggests a move towards more mainstream adoption and regulated investment in cryptocurrencies. If you found this analysis insightful, please share it with your network!

In 2028, Floki Inu is predicted to reach a maximum price of $0.000430. FLOKI price can reach a maximum level of $0.000699 and an average trading price of $0.000673 in 2031. Floki Inu is a meme coin driven by its community, the Floki Vikings. Inspired by Shiba Inu, Floki Inu aims to democratize power in the crypto space, pivoting the crypto market away from traditional financial entities. The Floki project ecosystem is diverse. It includes Valhalla, a blockchain combat game that rewards players with Floki tokens, and Floki Places, a store for merchandise and NFTs where purchases can be made using Floki tokens. Additionally, Floki University provides educational resources on the cryptocurrency market and blockchain technology. The recent launch (June 30, 2025) of the Valhalla mainnet of opBNB, coupled with DeFi partnerships like Chainlink, collectively enhances Floki Inu’s value and future potential by driving demand and expanding its use. Having attained its all-time high of $0.0003462 on June 5, 2024, can FLOKI reach $1?

If FLOKI loses $0.000084, it risks further decline toward $0.000080. FLOKI on the daily timeframe FLOKI’s daily chart for September 23 shows a sharp sell-off with the candle closing at $0.00008557, following a deep plunge that touched the lower Bollinger Band at $0.00008437. The RSI sits at 37.78, signaling oversold conditions, while the MACD has crossed bearishly, confirming downward pressure. However, today’s small green candle forming above the band suggests early signs of stabilizing. FLOKIUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView A recovery could push the price toward $0.00009607 (mid-Bollinger), but sustained buying strength is needed. On the downside, losing $0.00008400 risks further decline toward $0.00008000. Buyers looking for entries may consider around $0.00008450–0.00008500 with profit-taking near $0.000095–0.000096. FLOKI on the 4-hour timeframe On the 4-hour chart, FLOKI trades at $0.00008556 with mild recovery candles forming after the sharp drop. The Alligator indicator shows all three lines fanned out downward, reinforcing bearish momentum, while MACD remains negative though easing. FLOKIUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView Short-term resistance sits at $0.00008815, and only a break above $0.00009041 would hint at a stronger recovery. Support remains tight around $0.00008450. Volume has slowed, suggesting the market is awaiting a fresh direction.

Recovery is only convincing above $0.00008800–$0.00009000, with $0.00009600 as the key upside target. A drop below $0.00008400 would likely send FLOKI toward $0.00008000. Is Floki Inu a good investment? FLOKI INU could be a big win or a big loss. It’s backed by a strong Floki community and consistent ecosystem developments, which can drive short-and long-term gains. But it’s risky, with price swings and unclear long-term value. Only invest if you’re comfortable with the risk. Will FLOKI reach $0.001? Expert analysis suggests that the $0.001 price point is achievable, provided utility grows and investor interest increases enough to drive FLOKI up ~11x its current market cap. Will Floki reach $0.01? FLOKI would need up to $95 billion market cap to hit $0.01, over 110x its current value. Only the top six cryptos have surpassed this level, making it a major challenge without massive growth in adoption and demand. While possible, it’s unlikely in the short term. Does FLOKI have a good long-term future? According to expert analysis, FLOKI has a promising long-term future with consistent growth potential. The coin could reach up to $0.002 within the decade.

Pseudonymous market analyst MMBTtrader recently commented that the current environment appears “dead” and increasingly discouraging for holders. The analyst suggested that if present conditions persist, SHIB could risk dropping out of the top 40 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Despite this pessimistic description of current performance, the same analyst outlined a scenario in which SHIB could recover significantly, citing strong support levels and technical structures that may set the stage for a substantial breakout. Key Supports Remain Intact According to MMBTtrader , SHIB is still defending two important daily support zones, located near $0.000006 and $0.000010. Historically, these levels have provided stability and marked the starting points of earlier upward rallies. As long as these supports remain intact, the possibility of a future rebound remains on the table. The analyst emphasized that price action is currently constrained by a descending trendline that has acted as resistance for months. Breaking through this red trendline would be a critical step for bulls to regain control of the market. The 200% Milestone as Immediate Resistance Before any larger rally can be attempted, SHIB must first clear a major resistance barrier near $0.00003364. This level has already been tested multiple times in recent history, most notably in March and December 2024. On both occasions, buying pressure was unable to sustain momentum, and the market experienced sharp reversals. Because of this repeated rejection, the $0.00003364 region has now become a well-established ceiling for the token. MMBTtrader argues that successfully breaking through this barrier is essential to unlock further upside. If the resistance is overcome, the analyst projects an immediate rally of about 200% from current prices. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Roadmap Toward 400% and 600% Targets Should SHIB manage to establish a foothold above $0.00003364, the analyst believes a path would open toward larger price objectives. The next milestone would be a 400% rally, a level last observed in November 2021. This target would represent a significant recovery from current values, exhibiting renewed strength in the market. The long-term projection, however, lies at $0.00007730, Shiba Inu’s all-time high reached in October 2021. Achieving this price would equate to gains exceeding 600% from current levels. The analyst clarified that this outlook is conditional on the token holding its established supports and decisively breaking through the long-standing descending trendline that has capped its price movements. While MMBTtrader’s description of the market as “dead” highlights current investor frustration, the analysis ultimately suggests that SHIB’s long-term prospects are not entirely negative. With crucial support levels still intact and with resistance zones clearly identified, Shiba Inu retains the potential to stage a significant recovery. However, until the token can close above $0.00003364, progress toward the higher 400% and 600% targets remains speculative.

52171326,587084,1758672033,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52171326.jpeg,Helius Takes First Step In Solana Treasury With $175 Million Purchase,https://bitcoinist.com/helius-solana-treasury-175-million-sol-purchase/,"Helius Medical Technologies has officially kick-started its Solana (SOL) treasury strategy with an initial acquisition of 760,190 tokens. Helius Has Started Buying Solana With Its $500 Million Raise As announced in a press release , Helius Medical Technologies has completed its first Solana purchase for its digital asset treasury strategy. In total, the company has acquired 760,190 SOL at an average price of $231 per token, spending about $175 million. Originally a neurotech company, Helius Medical Technologies adopted a strategy focused on accumulating SOL earlier this month. Just a few days ago, the firm revealed that it had raised over $500 million for its digital asset treasury through a private placement offering. Among the key backers were Pantera Capital , an American venture capital and hedge fund specializing in blockchain and digital assets, and Summer Capital, a Hong Kong-headquartered investment firm. Joseph Chee, Executive Chairman at Helius, said: It has been gratifying to receive shows of support from multiple stakeholders across the Solana ecosystem, including staking providers, DeFi protocols and others. We take our responsibility to maximize shareholder value seriously and are eager to execute against our plan. With the latest purchase, Helius has begun deploying the raised capital into Solana. The company still has $335 million sitting in cash reserves for further treasury expansions, along with the potential to raise another $750 million if the stapled warrants from its private placement are exercised. The press release noted that, besides SOL being among the top coins in on-chain activity-related metrics, it’s also financially productive by design, thanks to its 7% native staking yield. Helius added: As an independent treasury company, HSDT’s mission is to support the growth and security of tokenized networks by serving as a long-term holder of $SOL, in addition to continuing the development of its neurotech and medical device operations The NASDAQ-listed neurotech firm isn’t the only one to pivot to a Solana treasury this month. Forward Industries, a company focused on design and manufacturing, also adopted a SOL strategy and closed a private investment in public equity (PIPE) earlier in September, raising $1.65 billion. The financing was led by three key players in Galaxy Digital, Multicoin Capital, and Jump Crypto. Last Monday, the firm executed its first purchase worth $1.58 billion, instantly becoming the largest SOL treasury holder in the world. In some other news, analytics firm Santiment has shared an update on how projects in the Solana ecosystem compare against each other in terms of the Development Activity metric. From the table, it’s visible that SOL continues to be the top-ranked coin with its developers putting in the most work on the project’s public GitHub repositories. Wormhole (W) and Pyth Network (PYTH) follow in second and third, respectively. SOL Price At the time of writing, Solana is trading around $218, down over 7% in the last week.",Solana|Helius|Helius Solana|SOL|solana|Solana Treasury|SOLUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SOL|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-24 00:00:33
52169499,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=826110,1758672056,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/52169499.jpeg,Bitcoin Consolidation Phase: Why Chop Is A Normal Aftermath Of Extreme Volatility,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-consolidation-phase/,"Following a period of intense volatility and a significant price movement, Bitcoin’s market is now experiencing a predictable consolidation phase, characterized by what traders call intraday chop. This is not a sign of weakness but rather a natural and often necessary stage in any market cycle. A Necessary Foundation For The Next Move In an X post, a dedicated crypto enthusiast, Uniswap Gems, provided a clear-eyed view of Bitcoin’s current price action, stating that the market is in a predictable phase of intraday chop after a period of extreme volatility. Related Reading: Countdown To ‘Bitcoin Bottom Day’: Why September 21 Could Change Everything Uniswap Gems noted that the recent huge, volatile move caught many traders off guard. As a result, the market is now in a period of consolidation. This chop is a sideways price movement within a tight range, which is often needed to establish a solid bottom after a sharp price swing. He cautions that this phase could last for the next 2 to 3 days, making it a difficult environment for those looking for quick directional trades. For a bullish trend to resume, BTC needs to flip $113,000 into a support level. If this happens, it could set the stage for a retest of the $115,000 range. However, if BTC fails to hold its current levels and makes new local lows, Uniswap Gems expects a more significant drop all the way down to sub $105,000, which would be a decisive move to the downside. Analyst Philakone, a crypto investor and day trader, has issued a stark reminder about the inherent volatility of BTC and historical price action in bear markets. His analysis focuses on the severe drawdowns that have consistently followed previous all-time highs. According to Philakone, BTC price has a historical tendency to drop between 75% to 85% from its peak during a bear market. This is a crucial point that he believes many people struggle to grasp, especially after a prolonged bull run. However, if BTC’s all-time high for the current cycle reaches $125,000, a 75% drop would bring the price down to a mere $30,000. Market Still Fragile Despite Heavy Liquidations Crypto trader known as KillaXBT has adopted a highly cautious stance on the BTC market. For the first time in a while, the expert is fading this BTC dip despite a massive liquidation event of 1.5 billion. His decision is based on a technical analysis of a key market indicator of the USDT dominance chart. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Retreats Lower Again – Is This Just a Healthy Dip? KillaXBT explains that the USDT.D (Tether Dominance) chart is showing concerning signals. If it breaks above its Equal Highs (EQHs), it could lead to a bigger drop in price.

Pham announced Tuesday. In a statement, the agency said its Global Markets Advisory Committee (GMAC), led by Pham, had last year recommended that regulators adopt “the use of non-cash collateral through distributed ledger technology.” Tokenized collateral can make contracts like futures and swaps more ‘efficient’. Ripple’s Senior Vice President of Stablecoins, Jack McDonald, says the tokenization of real-world assets, even future cash flows, is a trend that is rapidly advancing in financial technology.” Collateral is also used as security for traders’ obligations on derivatives contracts, mitigating the risk of default. CFTC pushes tokenized collateral to modernize derivatives markets The initiative is part of the CFTC’s great push to modernize capital markets and provide clear guidance for crypto firms. Specifically, it builds on the agency’s so-called “crypto sprint” to implement the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets report recommendations. Just recently, Congress passed the first crypto-specific bill to regulate stablecoins under the GENIUS Act . Federal regulators, including the Treasury Department, are still working out how to implement that law best. Likewise, the CFTC invites industry stakeholders to submit suggestions “on using tokenized collateral” in derivatives markets. Written comments are due by Oct. 20. Pham has also suggested launching a digital asset regulatory sandbox in the U.S. to test new market structures. “The public has spoken: tokenized markets are here, and they are the future,” Pham said. She added that the CFTC is pressing forward at the forefront of responsible innovation, and she values the support of their industry partners. The CFTC’s press release notably included statements from Circle, Coinbase, Crypto.com, and Ripple executives. In February, the agency outlined plans for a non-cash collateral pilot using stablecoins, with participation from those firms and MoonPay. Crypto industry leaders join advisory committees to shape policy Just days earlier, the CFTC appointed new members to its Global Markets Advisory Committee and subcommittees, adding several crypto industry leaders to the Digital Asset Markets Subcommittee (DAMS), underscoring the regulator’s continued engagement with the sector. Pham called out new DAMS members, including Katherine Minarik, chief legal officer at Uniswap Labs; Avery Ching, co-founder and CEO of Aptos Labs; James J. Hill, managing director and head of structure innovation at BNY; and Ben Sherwin, general counsel at Chainlink Labs. Scott Lucas, head of digital assets at JPMorgan, was also appointed co-chair of DAMS alongside Sandy Kaul, executive vice president at Franklin Templeton. They took over from Caroline Butler, who initially served as co-chair. “We look forward to working with the Commission and broader industry partners to help shape clear and effective regulatory frameworks in a well-structured digital asset market,” Lucas said. Kaul also said she intends to advance digital asset innovation into the mainstream “with prudent and well-designed consumer protections, enabling greater efficiencies and opportunities for all investors.” The DAMS was formed to offer the CFTC expert advice on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and tokenized markets, directing the agency on risk exposure and potential opportunity, in addition to policy recommendations and forging connections between traditional financial infrastructure and decentralized alternatives through close collaboration with CFTC staff. Pham was appointed CFTC Acting Chair on January 20, President Donald Trump’s inauguration day, and had served as a Commissioner since April 2022. Her current commissioner term is set to run through April 2027, giving her time to continue serving as chair until a permanent replacement is appointed.

52170055,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=817288,1758672520,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52170055.jpeg,"OpenAI reveals Stargate AI facility in Texas, projects planned in five more states",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/openai-reveals-stargate-ai-facility-texas/,"OpenAI revealed plans Tuesday to build six large computer facilities across the country, adding to its current Texas location as part of a massive $500 billion spending plan that President Donald Trump highlighted earlier this year. The company behind ChatGPT is working with Oracle and Softbank through a partnership called Stargate to construct these new sites. Two more will go up in Texas, with additional locations planned for New Mexico, Ohio, and another Midwest state that hasn’t been named yet. The biggest project sits in Abilene, Texas, where city leaders say the development is changing their old railroad community. Oracle officials who toured the eight-building site said it’s already set to become the world’s largest computer cluster for artificial intelligence work once construction wraps up. The complex will house hundreds of thousands of specialized computer chips. Sam Altman from OpenAI admitted that most people don’t think about what happens behind the scenes when they use ChatGPT. He and Clay Magouyrk, Oracle’s new co-chief, talked about their efforts to limit environmental damage in this dry part of West Texas, where temperatures reached 97 degrees Tuesday. “We’re burning gas to run this data center,” Altman said, though he noted that Stargate hopes to use different power sources as the project grows. The Texas facility needs roughly 900 megawatts of electricity to run all eight buildings and their computer chips. One building is already working, and a second that the executives visited Tuesday is almost done. Each equipment rack holds 72 of Nvidia’s GB200 chips, which handle the most demanding artificial intelligence tasks. Each building should contain about 60,000 of these chips. Residents have mixed reactions to the OpenAI project Not all residents are pleased because of the facility’s water and power requirements. The city’s water reservoirs were about half-full this week. People must follow a twice-weekly outdoor watering schedule, alternating days based on whether their house numbers are odd or even. The cooling system needs one million gallons from the city water supplies for its initial setup. Shaolei Ren, a University of California, Riverside professor who studies environmental effects of artificial intelligence, said the closed-loop cooling system shows developers care about local water supplies. But he noted these systems need more electricity, which means more indirect water use through power generation. Most residents first heard about Stargate when Trump announced it after returning to office in January. Originally planned for cryptocurrency mining, developers changed and expanded their plans for the artificial intelligence boom that ChatGPT started. The partnership said it was investing $100 billion initially, possibly reaching $500 billion, to build large data centers and power systems for AI development. OpenAI recently signed a deal to buy $300 billion worth of computing power from Oracle, a major gamble for the San Francisco company that began as a nonprofit. OpenAI and Oracle brought reporters and politicians, including Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz, to tour the site Tuesday for the first time. Cruz called Texas “ground zero for AI” because anyone building data centers wants “abundant, low-cost energy.” Of the five other Stargate projects announced Tuesday, Oracle will work with OpenAI on one in New Mexico’s Doña Ana County and another in Shackelford County, Texas. The company also plans one in the Midwest. Softbank has started construction on two more in Lordstown, Ohio, and Milam County, Texas. These projects help OpenAI reduce its dependence on Microsoft, which was previously its only computing partner. Altman told reporters his company has been “severely limited for the value we can offer to people.” “ChatGPT is slow. It’s not as smart as we’d like to be. Many users can’t use it as much as they would like,” Altman said. “We have many other ideas and products we want to build.” Get $50 free to trade crypto when you sign up to Bybit now",Tech|OpenAI|Softbank,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|MINING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-24 00:08:40

This unexpected jump occurred shortly after Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), the disgraced founder of FTX, posted a simple ‘gm’ (good morning) on X, formerly Twitter, breaking a six-month silence. The post immediately captured the attention of the crypto community, triggering a short-term rally for the FTT token. What Sparked the FTT Token Price Rally? The cryptocurrency market is often highly sensitive to social media activity, especially from prominent figures, even those with controversial pasts. SBF’s ‘gm’ post, his first public communication in half a year, was enough to ignite speculation and enthusiasm among certain traders. This brief message, devoid of any specific news or updates regarding FTX or its future, nevertheless became a catalyst for rapid market movement. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the FTT token price skyrocketed to $1.19, marking an impressive increase of 43.24% in a short period. Such a dramatic percentage gain highlights the speculative nature of many altcoins and how quickly sentiment can shift based on seemingly minor events. Community Speculation: The post fueled immediate discussions and theories among crypto enthusiasts. Short-Term Trading: Many traders likely saw an opportunity for quick profits, contributing to the pump. Market Volatility: The event underscores the inherent volatility of the crypto space, where news, even vague social media posts, can have outsized effects. Who is Sam Bankman-Fried and Why Does His Post Matter? Sam Bankman-Fried, once hailed as a crypto prodigy, is currently serving a 21-year prison sentence. He was convicted on multiple fraud charges involving a staggering $11 billion, related to the collapse of his cryptocurrency exchange, FTX. His scheduled release date is in December 2044. Given his legal situation and long absence from public communication, his sudden ‘gm’ post was highly unusual and unexpected. Despite his incarceration, SBF remains a figure of intense interest in the crypto world. His past influence and the sheer scale of FTX’s collapse mean that any communication from him, however brief, is scrutinized. This attention can, as seen with the FTT token price , translate into immediate market reactions, driven by a mix of curiosity, speculation, and perhaps a touch of nostalgia or hope for some. However, it is crucial to remember the context of his current circumstances. Understanding the Dynamics of Sudden Crypto Pumps The rapid increase in the FTT token price following SBF’s post is a classic example of a ‘pump’ driven by sentiment rather than fundamental value. Such events are common in the crypto market and often short-lived. Investors frequently react to perceived signals or community hype, leading to quick price movements that may not be sustainable in the long run. For FTT, the native token of the now-defunct FTX exchange, its utility and future prospects are severely limited due to the ongoing bankruptcy proceedings and SBF’s conviction. Therefore, any significant price movement should be viewed with extreme caution. Fundamental Analysis: Always prioritize the underlying value and utility of a token over speculative pumps. Risk Management: Understand that investments based on social media hype carry significant risk. Market Manipulation: Be aware that such events can sometimes be orchestrated to manipulate prices for personal gain. What Does This Mean for the FTT Token and Its Future? While the recent surge in FTT token price created a buzz, it is unlikely to signal a fundamental shift in the token’s long-term outlook. The token’s value remains intrinsically tied to the fate of the FTX bankruptcy estate, and its future utility is highly questionable. Investors should exercise extreme diligence and skepticism when considering FTT as an investment. The incident serves as a potent reminder of the unique challenges and opportunities within the crypto market. While quick gains are possible, they often come with equally rapid losses. It underscores the importance of a well-researched investment strategy that looks beyond fleeting social media trends and focuses on robust projects with clear roadmaps and genuine utility. In conclusion, the brief ‘gm’ from Sam Bankman-Fried on X caused a notable, albeit likely temporary, surge in the FTT token price . This event highlights the powerful, sometimes irrational, influence of social media and prominent figures on cryptocurrency markets, even when fundamental factors remain unchanged. It is a compelling reminder for all participants to approach the market with a critical eye and a commitment to informed decision-making. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What caused the recent FTT token price surge? The FTT token price surged after FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) posted ‘gm’ (good morning) on X, breaking a six-month silence. This social media activity triggered speculation and short-term trading. Q2: Who is Sam Bankman-Fried and what is his current status? Sam Bankman-Fried is the founder of the collapsed FTX cryptocurrency exchange. He is currently serving a 21-year prison sentence after being convicted on fraud charges. Q3: Is the FTT token a good investment now? Given SBF’s conviction and the ongoing FTX bankruptcy, the FTT token’s future utility and value are highly uncertain. Any price surge based on social media activity is likely speculative and carries significant risk. Q4: How does influencer activity impact crypto prices? Cryptocurrency markets can be highly sensitive to influencer activity, even from controversial figures. Social media posts can quickly generate hype, speculation, and rapid price movements, often detached from fundamental value. Q5: What are the risks associated with investing in FTT? Risks include the token’s limited utility post-FTX collapse, ongoing bankruptcy proceedings, high volatility, and the potential for rapid price depreciation after speculative pumps.

A groundbreaking development in South Korea is setting a new standard for trust in the stablecoin sector. This pivotal move involves the first-ever KRWIN stablecoin custody agreement, designed specifically for international users. What is the Significance of KRWIN Stablecoin Custody? On September 24th, the fiat-collateralized stablecoin project KRWIN made a significant announcement. They revealed a virtual asset custody agreement with Korea Digital Asset (KODA). This isn’t just another partnership; it marks a historical first for South Korea. K-Clone, the operator behind KRWIN and a subsidiary of KOSDAQ-listed INITECH, confirmed that this is the nation’s inaugural custody service for a stablecoin targeting overseas users, even in its Proof of Concept (POC) phase. Why does this matter? It introduces a new level of institutional-grade security to the stablecoin ecosystem. This initiative directly addresses common concerns about stablecoin reserves and operational integrity. The focus on overseas users highlights South Korea’s ambition to be a global player in digital finance. Ensuring Transparency and Stability: How Does KRWIN Stablecoin Custody Work? The core of the KRWIN project operates on a strict 1:1 reserve principle. This means that every single KRWIN token issued on-chain will be fully deposited with KODA. Think of KODA as a highly secure digital vault, safeguarding the assets that back the stablecoin. Both the volume of tokens issued and the corresponding deposit records will be transparently verifiable on the blockchain ledger. This commitment to auditable reserves is crucial for building user confidence. Lee Sang-joon, CEO of K-Clone, emphasized that this early adoption of custody services isn’t just a technical detail; it’s a clear statement of the project’s dedication to transparency and stability. In a market often scrutinized for its volatility, such measures are invaluable. This proactive approach aims to mitigate risks and foster a more reliable environment for digital asset transactions. Expanding Horizons: KRWIN’s Vision for Southeast Asia Beyond the technical safeguards, KRWIN has ambitious plans for expansion. The company intends to broaden KRWIN’s utility across Southeast Asia. This strategic move will involve integrating the stablecoin with the thriving K-content industry, tourism, and various payment systems. By doing so, KRWIN aims to support and grow the wider K-content ecosystem, leveraging South Korea’s cultural influence. This expansion could unlock new opportunities for businesses and consumers alike. Imagine seamless cross-border payments for K-pop merchandise, Korean drama subscriptions, or even tourism packages, all powered by a stable and transparent digital currency. The vision is clear: to make digital transactions easier, safer, and more accessible for a global audience, starting with a strong foundation of KRWIN stablecoin custody . The Future of Digital Assets: A Glimpse into Trust The partnership between KRWIN and KODA represents a significant step forward in the institutionalization of digital assets. It demonstrates a proactive approach to regulatory compliance and user protection, which are essential for mainstream adoption. As the crypto world matures, such robust custody solutions will likely become the norm, not the exception. This development paves the way for greater trust and wider acceptance of stablecoins as a legitimate tool for international commerce and daily transactions. The commitment to verifiable reserves and secure custody underscores a growing trend towards greater accountability in the crypto space. This initiative could serve as a blueprint for other projects seeking to establish themselves as reliable and trustworthy players in the global digital economy. The future of digital finance looks brighter with initiatives like the KRWIN stablecoin custody agreement leading the charge. Summary: A New Era of Confidence The signing of South Korea’s first KRWIN stablecoin custody deal with KODA marks a pivotal moment for the digital asset industry. By prioritizing transparency, stability, and secure custody from its initial phase, KRWIN is setting a high standard for stablecoin projects, especially those targeting an international user base. This strategic move, coupled with plans for expansion into Southeast Asia via K-content and tourism, positions KRWIN not just as a stablecoin, but as a key enabler for a more integrated and trustworthy global digital economy. This is a testament to the growing maturity and institutional confidence in the crypto space, promising a more secure and accessible future for digital finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is KRWIN, and what is its primary purpose? A1: KRWIN is a fiat-collateralized stablecoin project. Its primary purpose is to provide a stable digital currency for overseas users, backed by traditional fiat reserves on a 1:1 basis, ensuring transparency and stability. Q2: What is the significance of the custody agreement between KRWIN and KODA? A2: This agreement is South Korea’s first virtual asset custody deal for a stablecoin aimed at international users. It means KODA will securely hold the reserves backing KRWIN tokens, enhancing transparency and stability, and allowing verification on the blockchain. Q3: How does the 1:1 reserve principle work for KRWIN? A3: The 1:1 reserve principle ensures that for every KRWIN token issued on the blockchain, an equivalent amount of fiat currency (or other collateral) is deposited with KODA. Both the issuance volume and deposit records are publicly verifiable on the blockchain. Q4: Where does KRWIN plan to expand its services? A4: KRWIN plans to expand its use cases across Southeast Asia. This expansion will involve linking the stablecoin to the K-content industry, tourism, and various payment systems to foster growth in the broader K-content ecosystem. Q5: How does this deal contribute to the overall trust in stablecoins? A5: By adopting institutional-grade custody services early, KRWIN demonstrates a strong commitment to transparency, security, and regulatory compliance. This proactive approach helps build user confidence and sets a precedent for greater accountability in the stablecoin market.

Currently, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index stands at 44, a slight uptick from yesterday but still firmly entrenched in the “fear” category. This crucial indicator helps us gauge the prevailing sentiment among investors, offering a snapshot of whether market participants are feeling overly cautious or excessively optimistic. Understanding this index is vital for anyone navigating the volatile world of digital assets. What Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Tell Us About Market Mood? When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index leans towards fear, it typically suggests that investors are hesitant, potentially selling off assets, or avoiding new investments due to price uncertainty. A score of 44, while not “extreme fear,” still highlights a prevailing sense of caution. This sentiment can sometimes present unique opportunities for those who are prepared to act contrary to the crowd, remembering the old adage: “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated for Accuracy? The strength of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index lies in its multi-faceted approach to measuring market sentiment. It doesn’t rely on a single data point but rather aggregates several key factors, each weighted to provide a comprehensive overview. This robust methodology aims to present a balanced perspective, minimizing bias from any one source. Here’s a breakdown of its components: Volatility (25%): This measures the current price fluctuations of Bitcoin compared to its average levels over the last 30 and 90 days. Higher volatility often signals fear. Trading Volume (25%): High trading volumes in a negative market can indicate strong selling pressure, suggesting fear. Conversely, high volume with rising prices can signal greed. Social Media Mentions (15%): An analysis of cryptocurrency-related hashtags and posts across various social media platforms. High engagement and negative sentiment can push the index towards fear. Surveys (15%): Polling investors directly provides a qualitative insight into their current market outlook. This component helps capture direct sentiment. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): An increase in Bitcoin’s market capitalization dominance often indicates investors are moving away from altcoins into the perceived safety of Bitcoin, a sign of fear in the broader altcoin market. Google Search Volume (10%): Tracking search queries related to cryptocurrencies, particularly those indicating market trends or price predictions, offers a glimpse into retail investor interest and potential panic or excitement. Navigating Crypto Markets with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Understanding the current reading of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index can be a powerful tool for investors, but it’s important to use it wisely. While it doesn’t offer direct buy or sell signals, it provides context. For instance, prolonged periods of “extreme fear” (scores below 20) have historically coincided with market bottoms, potentially indicating good entry points for long-term investors. Conversely, “extreme greed” (scores above 75) might suggest a market correction is on the horizon. However, relying solely on this index would be a mistake. It should always be used in conjunction with fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and a clear understanding of your own risk tolerance. The index serves best as a complementary indicator, helping you to assess the emotional temperature of the market and perhaps counter your own inherent biases. Understanding the Psychology Behind the Crypto Fear & Greed Index The human elements of fear and greed are deeply ingrained in financial markets, and the Crypto Fear & Greed Index beautifully illustrates this. Fear often leads to panic selling, causing prices to drop further, while greed can drive irrational exuberance, pushing asset values beyond sustainable levels. These emotions create cycles that are evident in market behavior. When fear dominates, investors tend to make decisions based on emotion rather than logic, often selling at a loss to avoid further pain. Conversely, during periods of greed, the fear of missing out (FOMO) can lead to speculative buying, often by those who are new to the market or less experienced. Recognizing these emotional patterns, both in yourself and in the broader market, is a significant step towards becoming a more disciplined and successful investor. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index remains a vital barometer for understanding the collective psyche of the crypto market. Its current reading of 44, signaling persistent fear, serves as a reminder that caution still prevails. By understanding its components and how to interpret its signals, investors can gain valuable insights, helping them to make more informed and less emotionally driven decisions in the often-turbulent world of cryptocurrencies. Stay informed, stay rational, and let data guide your path. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a tool that measures the current sentiment of the cryptocurrency market. It ranges from 0 (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme greed), indicating whether investors are feeling fearful or optimistic. How is “fear” different from “extreme fear” on the index? “Fear” (typically 25-49) suggests general caution and uncertainty among investors. “Extreme Fear” (0-24) indicates widespread panic, significant selling pressure, and a strong belief that prices will fall further. Can the Crypto Fear & Greed Index predict market bottoms or tops? While the index can offer strong indications, it is not a direct predictive tool. Historically, extreme fear has often coincided with market bottoms, and extreme greed with market tops, but it should be used with other analytical methods. What factors influence the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The index is influenced by six key factors: volatility, trading volume, social media mentions, investor surveys, Bitcoin’s market capitalization dominance, and Google search volume. Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index only for Bitcoin? While Bitcoin’s data plays a significant role due to its market dominance, the index is designed to reflect the overall sentiment of the broader cryptocurrency market, not just Bitcoin specifically.

A recent landmark decision by a South Korean court has provided crucial insight into the distinct challenges involved in DEX CEX listing . This ruling formally recognizes the significant difference in difficulty between getting a token listed on a decentralized exchange (DEX) versus a centralized exchange (CEX), a distinction that could profoundly impact how projects approach their market entry and contractual agreements. Why is DEX CEX Listing So Different? Understanding the Core Divide Understanding the court’s perspective requires a closer look at the fundamental operational models of these two primary types of cryptocurrency exchanges. The South Korean court’s ruling underscores that the process for a DEX CEX listing varies dramatically, primarily due to their underlying structures and regulatory environments. On one hand, centralized exchanges (CEXs) act as gatekeepers in the crypto world. They operate with strict regulatory compliance, extensive due diligence, and often demand a lengthy, rigorous review process for any token seeking a listing. This comprehensive evaluation typically includes assessing the project’s legitimacy, its technological innovation, the credibility of its development team, market potential, and adherence to various legal frameworks. Conversely, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) function on a permissionless model. This means that virtually anyone can initiate trading for a token by simply creating a smart contract and establishing a liquidity pool. This design inherently removes the need for a central authority’s approval, making the barrier to entry significantly lower and the process far more accessible for new tokens. The Seoul Court’s Definitive Stance on DEX CEX Listing Requirements The specific case that brought this crucial distinction to light involved a dispute over a performance bonus tied to a cryptocurrency listing contract. A plaintiff argued that listing a carbon credit-linked token on a DEX fulfilled a contractual requirement for an “overseas exchange” listing. They sought a substantial payment of six million tokens, firmly believing their actions had met the agreement’s terms. However, the 33rd Civil Affairs Division of the Seoul Central District Court, on September 4th, rendered a definitive verdict that challenged this interpretation. The court decisively rejected the plaintiff’s claim. It explicitly emphasized that the ease of creating a smart contract and establishing a liquidity pool on a DEX cannot be equated with the stringent, multi-faceted review process required by a CEX. This landmark ruling sets a clear precedent for how “exchange listing” might be interpreted in future contractual agreements, especially concerning DEX CEX listing conditions and their associated rewards. What Are the Far-Reaching Implications for Crypto Projects and Contracts? This South Korean court ruling carries significant weight for cryptocurrency projects, developers, and investors, not just locally but across the global blockchain ecosystem. It underscores the critical importance of clear, precise language in any contracts related to token listings and performance metrics. Key takeaways and actionable insights for the industry include: Enhanced Contractual Clarity: Future agreements should explicitly define whether a “listing” refers specifically to a CEX, a DEX, or encompasses both. Ambiguity, as seen in this case, can lead to costly and time-consuming legal disputes. Strategic Listing Planning: Projects aiming for broader market adoption and perceived legitimacy might still prioritize CEX listings, despite their higher barrier to entry. However, DEX listings remain an invaluable initial step for establishing early liquidity and community engagement. Refined Investor Perception: Investors and institutional players are likely to view CEX listings as a stronger validation of a project’s credibility, stability, and long-term viability, given the rigorous vetting process involved. This could influence investment decisions and project valuations. Regulatory Scrutiny: The ruling highlights the increasing legal and regulatory scrutiny on the crypto space, pushing for more defined terms and responsibilities for all participants. Ultimately, the ruling provides a robust legal framework that distinctly separates the two types of listings, impacting how performance bonuses, equity releases, and other contractual obligations tied to DEX CEX listing are viewed and enforced. Navigating the Future of DEX CEX Listing: A New Standard? The Seoul Central District Court’s decision is more than just a verdict in a single case; it represents a foundational clarification for the entire crypto ecosystem. By formally acknowledging the vast disparity in difficulty for DEX CEX listing , the court has provided much-needed legal precedent that the industry must heed. This ruling encourages greater precision and accountability in legal and business dealings within the blockchain space. It serves as a powerful reminder that while decentralization offers incredible accessibility and innovation, the path to mainstream acceptance often involves navigating the more stringent requirements of traditional financial gateways. Cryptocurrency projects and stakeholders must now carefully consider these distinctions when drafting contracts, setting development milestones, and strategizing their market presence. This decision sets a new standard for understanding the value and effort associated with different types of exchange listings. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the main difference between a DEX and a CEX, according to the court’s ruling? A1: The court ruled that CEXs require a rigorous review process for token listings, involving extensive due diligence and compliance. In contrast, DEXs allow anyone to easily initiate trading by creating a smart contract and liquidity pool, making the listing process significantly simpler and permissionless. Q2: Why did the South Korean court rule that DEX listings are easier? A2: The court’s reasoning was based on the operational models. CEXs have central authorities that vet projects, while DEXs are decentralized, allowing anyone to list tokens without approval, simply by setting up the necessary smart contracts and liquidity. Q3: How does this ruling impact cryptocurrency project contracts? A3: This ruling emphasizes the need for extreme clarity in contracts. Agreements involving token listings should explicitly state whether a “listing” refers to a CEX, a DEX, or both, to avoid future legal disputes over performance bonuses or other obligations. Q4: Does a DEX listing provide the same benefits as a CEX listing? A4: While DEX listings offer accessibility and early liquidity, CEX listings often provide broader market reach, increased investor trust due to rigorous vetting, and perceived legitimacy. The court’s ruling suggests they are not equivalent in terms of the effort and validation they represent. Q5: Is it always better to list on a CEX than a DEX? A5: Not necessarily. The “better” option depends on a project’s goals. DEXs are excellent for early-stage projects seeking immediate liquidity and community engagement. CEXs are often preferred for projects aiming for mainstream adoption, institutional investment, and higher visibility, despite the more challenging DEX CEX listing process.

Recently, there’s been chatter about the fate of altcoin season , especially after CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index showed a significant drop. But what if we told you that, according to expert analysis, altcoin season might not be over at all? Understanding the Enduring Altcoin Season It’s natural to feel a bit of uncertainty when market indicators dip. However, a closer look at underlying trends often reveals a different story. Noted macroeconomist and trader Henrik Zeberg has offered a compelling perspective that challenges the notion of a concluded altcoin season . Zeberg points to the OTHER/BTC chart as a crucial indicator. This chart essentially compares the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies, excluding Bitcoin, against Bitcoin’s own market cap. It’s a powerful tool for gauging the relative strength of altcoins versus Bitcoin. His analysis highlights that the OTHER/BTC chart has successfully broken through a key resistance level. This technical breakout is often interpreted as a bullish signal, suggesting a potential shift in market dynamics in favor of altcoins. For many traders, this move indicates that the momentum for altcoins is still very much alive. Why Analysts Believe Altcoin Season Persists The breaking of the 0.14 resistance level on the OTHER/BTC chart is a significant development. According to Zeberg, this technical pattern suggests that the current altcoin season is far from over. In fact, he suggests that if this level holds and momentum continues, we could see the OTHER/BTC ratio climb substantially, potentially reaching as high as 0.66. This kind of surge would represent a massive outperformance of altcoins compared to Bitcoin, a hallmark of a true altcoin season . It’s a scenario where investors might see substantial gains across a broad spectrum of alternative cryptocurrencies. Technical Breakout: The OTHER/BTC chart’s move above a critical resistance level is a strong bullish indicator. Market Cap Shift: This suggests altcoins are gaining strength relative to Bitcoin. Potential for Growth: Analysts foresee significant upside if current trends continue. Such an outlook provides a beacon of hope for those who might have been discouraged by recent index declines. It underscores the importance of looking beyond surface-level indicators and delving into deeper technical analysis. What Does This Mean for Your Crypto Portfolio During Altcoin Season? Understanding these dynamics can be incredibly beneficial for your investment strategy. A sustained altcoin season means opportunities might be abundant beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, it’s crucial to approach these opportunities with careful consideration. While the overall trend may be bullish for altcoins, individual projects will always carry their own risks and rewards. Diversification and thorough research remain paramount. Don’t just chase the hype; understand the technology, team, and market potential of any altcoin you consider investing in. Navigating Volatility and Maximizing Opportunities The crypto market is known for its volatility, and altcoin season is no exception. Price swings can be dramatic, offering both significant upside and potential downside. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on key technical charts like OTHER/BTC, not just general sentiment. Research Diligently: Understand the fundamentals of specific altcoins before investing. Manage Risk: Never invest more than you can afford to lose, and consider setting stop-loss orders. Consider Diversification: Spread your investments across different altcoins and sectors to mitigate risk. The potential for altcoins to outperform Bitcoin during such periods can be substantial. For those who position themselves wisely, this could lead to significant portfolio growth. It’s about being prepared and making informed decisions rather than reacting to every market fluctuation. The Bottom Line: Is Altcoin Season Truly Valid? Despite what a single index might suggest, the broader technical analysis indicates that the altcoin season remains a valid and active market phenomenon. Expert opinions, like that of Henrik Zeberg, provide a compelling counter-narrative to the idea that the altcoin rally is over. The breakout on the OTHER/BTC chart offers a strong technical foundation for continued altcoin strength. While market conditions can change rapidly, the current analysis suggests that there’s still plenty of potential for altcoins to shine. Keep your eyes on the charts, stay informed, and remember that patience and strategic planning are key in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency. This period could be an exciting time for investors willing to look beyond the headlines and delve into the technical details that often drive market movements. The narrative of a resilient altcoin season continues to unfold. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is an altcoin season? An altcoin season is a period when cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin (altcoins) significantly outperform Bitcoin in terms of price growth and market capitalization. Investors often look for signs of an altcoin season to potentially maximize returns. How is the CoinMarketCap Altcoin Season Index calculated? The CoinMarketCap Altcoin Season Index typically measures how many of the top 50 altcoins (excluding stablecoins) have outperformed Bitcoin over a specific period, often 90 days. If a significant majority (e.g., 75%) have outperformed, it indicates an altcoin season. Why might an index drop while altcoin season is still valid? An index might drop for several reasons, even if the underlying trend is bullish for altcoins. This could include temporary Bitcoin dominance spikes, specific large-cap altcoins underperforming, or the index’s calculation methodology not fully capturing broader market sentiment or technical breakouts like the OTHER/BTC chart. What is the OTHER/BTC chart? The OTHER/BTC chart compares the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies excluding Bitcoin to the market capitalization of Bitcoin. It’s a crucial indicator for understanding the relative strength and performance of altcoins versus Bitcoin. What are some key indicators to watch for altcoin season? Besides the OTHER/BTC chart, key indicators include Bitcoin dominance (a lower dominance often favors altcoins), individual altcoin performance against Bitcoin, trading volumes for altcoins, and overall market sentiment towards riskier assets. Is it safe to invest during altcoin season? While altcoin season presents opportunities for high returns, it also comes with increased volatility and risk. It’s essential to conduct thorough research, understand the risks associated with individual projects, diversify your portfolio, and only invest what you can afford to lose.

The Altcoin Season Index , a crucial gauge of market sentiment, has recently climbed four points, reaching a notable 68. This uptick suggests a shifting tide in the digital asset landscape, hinting that altcoins are gaining significant momentum against Bitcoin. For many, this rise in the Altcoin Season Index signals a potentially lucrative period for alternative cryptocurrencies. What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index , provided by CoinMarketCap, is a fascinating tool designed to measure the collective performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. However, it specifically excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens to give a clearer picture of speculative asset performance. It’s essentially a scoreboard comparing how these leading altcoins fare against Bitcoin over a 90-day period. Here’s how it works: The market enters an “altcoin season” when 75% of these top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin in the last three months. A reading closer to 100 indicates a robust and widespread altcoin season. Conversely, a lower reading, especially below 25, typically points towards a “Bitcoin season,” where Bitcoin dominates the market. Understanding this index helps investors gauge the prevailing market sentiment and make informed decisions about their portfolio allocations. A rising Altcoin Season Index suggests that the broader market is favoring altcoins. The Significance of an Altcoin Season Index at 68 The recent jump of the Altcoin Season Index to 68 is more than just a number; it reflects a tangible shift in investor interest and capital flow. Moving from 64 to 68 in a single day is a strong indicator that a substantial portion of the top altcoins are currently outperforming Bitcoin. This development often sparks optimism among altcoin enthusiasts and investors. What does this mean for the market? Increased Opportunities: Many altcoins could see significant price appreciation. Diversification Potential: Investors might find new avenues beyond Bitcoin for portfolio growth. Shifting Dominance: While Bitcoin often leads the charge, an Altcoin Season Index at 68 suggests altcoins are now taking the spotlight. However, it’s crucial to remember that 68 is still below the 75 threshold required for an official “altcoin season.” This means we are in a strong pre-season phase, with considerable momentum building, but not yet a full-blown altcoin dominance. Navigating the Dynamics of Altcoin Season As the Altcoin Season Index climbs, market participants often look for strategies to capitalize on the trend. This period can offer exciting prospects, but it also comes with its unique set of challenges and risks. Prudent navigation is key to maximizing potential gains while mitigating downsides. Consider these actionable insights: Research Diligently: Focus on altcoins with strong fundamentals, active development, and clear use cases. Avoid purely speculative plays. Manage Risk: Altcoins can be highly volatile. Only invest what you can afford to lose and consider setting stop-loss orders. Diversify Smartly: Instead of putting all your eggs in one altcoin basket, spread your investments across several promising projects. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on market news, project updates, and, of course, the Altcoin Season Index itself. The challenges include increased volatility, the risk of “pump and dump” schemes, and the sheer number of altcoins making it difficult to choose winners. Therefore, a well-thought-out strategy is indispensable. What Does the Rising Altcoin Season Index Mean for You? Whether you are a seasoned crypto investor or just starting, the current trajectory of the Altcoin Season Index presents an interesting scenario. It signifies a potential shift in market dynamics, where a broader range of digital assets might offer attractive returns. This doesn’t mean Bitcoin is out of the picture; rather, it indicates a broadening of the market’s focus. For individual investors, this could be a time to: Re-evaluate existing portfolios to identify underperforming assets or new opportunities. Explore emerging sectors within the altcoin space, such as DeFi, NFTs, or Layer 2 solutions. Educate yourself further on the projects that are driving this altcoin momentum. The market is always evolving, and the rise of the Altcoin Season Index to 68 is a clear signal that altcoins are demanding attention. Staying alert and adaptable will be crucial. In conclusion, the climb of the Altcoin Season Index to 68 is a significant development in the cryptocurrency market. It underscores a growing bullish sentiment towards altcoins, indicating that many are currently outperforming Bitcoin. While not yet an official “altcoin season,” this strong momentum suggests a vibrant period for alternative cryptocurrencies. As always, thorough research and a disciplined approach are vital for navigating these dynamic market conditions successfully. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the Altcoin Season Index?

Have you ever wondered why, despite technological advancements, significant financial losses continue to plague the industry? Ronghui Gu, co-founder of leading blockchain security firm CertiK, recently shed light on a surprising truth that challenges common perceptions about where projects are truly failing. What’s Truly Behind Crypto’s Major Financial Losses? During an insightful roundtable at KBW 2025, Gu clarified that the industry frequently misunderstands the root causes of major financial losses. Many assume smart contract vulnerabilities are solely to blame, but the reality is more complex. Last year, an estimated $1.4 billion in damages was recorded. Gu emphasized these losses weren’t exclusively due to technical flaws. Human factors, like negligence or phishing, also played a significant role. No program is ever perfectly secure. This fundamental understanding drives CertiK’s approach, which employs a multi-layered defense system. This includes rigorous code reviews, comprehensive security audits, and continuous, real-time monitoring. This holistic strategy aims to cover all potential weak points, acknowledging that threats constantly evolve. The Alarming Disparity: Marketing vs. Crypto Security Spending Perhaps Gu’s most striking revelation was the stark difference in how projects allocate their budgets. He highlighted that most projects dedicate substantially larger budgets to marketing than to essential crypto security measures. This imbalance creates a dangerous vulnerability: Marketing focuses on growth: It’s about visibility, hype, and attracting new investors. Security focuses on protection: It’s about safeguarding assets, maintaining trust, and ensuring long-term viability. Gu firmly believes technical tools alone are insufficient for robust security. Raising awareness among developers, project teams, and investors is equally important. When projects prioritize outward appearance and rapid expansion over fundamental protection, they expose themselves and their users to unnecessary risks. Boosting Your Project’s Crypto Security: Lessons from Industry Leaders So, how can we shift this paradigm and strengthen crypto security ? Gu urged more projects to learn from successful industry examples. Projects like WEMIX and Klaytn have demonstrated proactive commitment by significantly increasing their security budgets. This strategic investment is not just an expense; it’s a critical foundation for sustainable growth and user trust. Here are key takeaways for projects aiming to enhance their security posture: Reallocate Budgets: Reconsider the balance between marketing and security. Secure projects build trust. Embrace Multi-Layered Defense: Go beyond a single audit. Think continuous monitoring and internal protocols. Prioritize Education: Invest in team training and educate your community. Human error is a major attack vector. Seek Expert Guidance: Partner with reputable security firms like CertiK. Ultimately, a strong focus on crypto security isn’t just about preventing losses; it’s about building a resilient, trustworthy ecosystem that can thrive. Summary: Investing in Security is Investing in the Future Ronghui Gu’s insights from CertiK serve as a powerful wake-up call. The misconception that all financial losses stem solely from smart contract vulnerabilities needs correction. More importantly, the alarming trend of prioritizing marketing over fundamental crypto security must be reversed. Projects emulating leaders like WEMIX and Klaytn by dedicating sufficient resources to security will protect assets, users, and foster greater confidence for sustainable, long-term success in decentralized finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What did CertiK co-founder Ronghui Gu highlight? A1: Gu clarified that crypto losses involve human factors, not just smart contract flaws, and projects often prioritize marketing over security. Q2: Why aren’t technical tools enough for crypto security? A2: Human factors contribute significantly to breaches. Awareness and education for developers, projects, and investors are crucial for comprehensive protection. Q3: Which projects exemplify increased security budgets? A3: WEMIX and Klaytn were cited for proactively increasing their security budgets, setting a positive industry precedent. Q4: What is CertiK’s approach to smart contract security? A4: CertiK uses a multi-layered defense: code reviews, security audits, and continuous monitoring, addressing both technical and human-related risks. Q5: What are key actions for projects to improve security? A5: Projects should reallocate budgets, implement multi-layered defenses, prioritize education, and seek expert guidance from security firms.

Notably, the Net Position Change (NPC) of the youngest cohort of BTC holders has re-entered positive territory, raising hopes for the cryptocurrency to gain bullish momentum. Bitcoin NPC Back In Positive Territory According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Crazzyblockk, the NPC of Bitcoin holders who have held the digital asset for less than one month has decisively flipped into positive territory. This change shows that new demand is flowing into the market at an accelerated rate. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Supply Ratio Declines After Fed Cut, Setting Stage For $120,000 Test Crazzyblockk highlighted that the 30-day change in supply held by wallets younger than one month has surged, hitting as high as +73,702 BTC on September 23. The following chart confirms the uptick following a period of negative action. It is worth emphasizing that the influx of fresh capital into the Bitcoin market is beneficial in helping to absorb the supply being sold by long-term holders (LTH). Typically, LTH refers to holders who have held BTC for more than six months. Currently, these LTH are selling their BTC at a rate of approximately -145,000 BTC, indicative of a typical bull market where early investors realize profits. The analyst added that the fact that selling pressure is being met with strong demand from new entrants is a sign of the rally’s sustainability. The CryptoQuant contributor added that the accumulation is not limited to the newest cohort. Besides the less than one-month cohort, short-term holders (STH) – investors who have held BTC for less than six months – are also accumulating. The STH NPC has changed to +159,098 BTC, cementing the robust demand for the top cryptocurrency by market cap across a spectrum of investors based on their time in the market. Crazzyblockk added: The current dynamic – where profit-taking from long-term investors is being absorbed by a new and enthusiastic wave of buyers – is a classic characteristic of a strengthening bull market. The positive flip in the youngest holder cohort is a leading indicator of broadening market participation and suggests a strong conviction among new investors. This robust demand structure is highly supportive of continued price appreciation in the near to medium term. Some Areas Of Concern For BTC While the demand for BTC from young cohorts is encouraging, some concerns still linger about the digital asset’s near-term price action. For instance, BTC exchange inflows remain elevated, raising fears of greater selling pressure.

That said, the digital asset’s fundamentals continue to strengthen as the Bitcoin network activity recently reached a new 2025 peak. At press time, BTC trades at $112,804, down 0.2% in the past 24 hours.
