Current movements suggest BTC could climb further, potentially testing the resistance level at $116,283.

The 10-day Simple Moving Average shows more strength than the 100-day average, reinforcing this bullish outlook.

Donald Trump’s DOGE Under Scrutiny From Law firm According to a January 20 report from The Washington Post , National Security Counselors has filed a lawsuit based upon accusations that DOGE violates federal transparency requirements. A lawsuit was filed against Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy’s new nongovernmental entity as soon as Donald Trump was officially president. https://t.co/1ZQnybii3H — The Washington Post (@washingtonpost) January 20, 2025 Documents obtained by The Washington Post reveal that the so-called “public interest law firm” alleges that DOGE fails to follow long-standing executive branch hiring and disclosure practices. National Security Counselors claim that DOGE fits the categorization of a federal advisory committee, an entity that has specific standards of governance including filing a charter of governance which DOGE has allegedly yet to do. Despite these allegations, Trump remains confident in the project and its leadership. Trump announced the project in November 2024. He tapped both Musk and former Republican Party candidate Vivek Ramaswamy to lead the initiative, which focuses heavily on reducing governmental “red tape” and excessive spending. You might also like Donald Trump Taps Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy to Oversee Department of Government Efficiency “Together, these two wonderful Americans will pave the way for my Administration to dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal agencies,” Trump said in part in a November 2024 statement. However, reports emerged over the weekend that Ramaswamy may look to depart the newfound advisory committee in light of tensions within DOGE itself, though he has yet to publicly comment on the allegations. Ramaswamy is reportedly planning to announce his campaign for Ohio governor as soon as the end of the month. Elon Musk Continues DOGE Work Amid Ramaswamy Rift Reports Ramaswamy’s DOGE departure and the panel’s lawsuit come at a critical point for Trump, who has already invoked several executive orders upon taking office, one of which designated digital assets as a “national priority.” President Trump, who played a role in launching his family’s crypto platform World Liberty Financial last year, has long promised to implement crypto-friendly regulations upon his return to the White House. “We will have regulations,” Trump stated at the Bitcoin 2024 Conference this past summer, adding, “but from now on, the rules will be written by the people who love your industry, not hate your industry. Trump has also tapped former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins to lead the federal regulator following years of stringent crypto enforcement by now-resigned SEC chair Gary Gensler. With Trump now officially back in the White House, it seems as though a crypto regulatory framework is closer to happening than ever before.

Table of Contents The Dogecoin success story WallitIQ: The Ethereum token to transform crypto investments Conclusion During the 2021 bull run, a famous analyst turned a strategic Dogecoin (DOGE) investment into a $30 million profit, earning worldwide acclaim. This crypto visionary has identified a new opportunity in WallitIQ (WLTQ), suggesting the Ethereum token poised for a 34,550% rally with its $0.0420 presale. The Dogecoin success story Dogecoin started as a meme token but soon became a market phenomenon. In 2021, DOGE skyrocketed from under $0.01 to its all-time high of $0.74, influenced by community enthusiasm and endorsements from high-profile figures like Elon Musk. Currently trading at $0.3591, the Dogecoin price shows potential for a rebound, with analysts predicting a climb to $1. However, the days of astronomical returns seem gone. Recognizing this, the famous analyst has shifted focus to WallitIQ, which promises greater upside. You might also like: Crypto expert advises buying WallitIQ at $0.04 before it’s too late WallitIQ: The Ethereum token to transform crypto investments WallitIQ has succeeded from its first presale stage to the current phase. Starting at $0.0171, the token’s price has surged to $0.0420, reflecting a 71.43% increase, with the price set to jump to $0.0620 in the fourth stage. With over $7 million generated in revenue and $5 million more expected to be raised in its current presale stage, the Ethereum token has become a favorite among investors. One of the key drivers behind WallitIQ’s success is its recently announced MVP build of a crypto wallet management mobile app. Designed to simplify wallet and transaction management, the app offers wallet management tools for ETH and USDT wallets. It also generates QR codes for easy payment receipt so users can test the Scan and Pay QR feature. The platform’s crypto wallet management mobile app is integrated with CoinGecko’s API. The API captures all price data including the opening, closing, highest, and lowest prices of all crypto tickers. Thus, users will always have an all-around view of their assets’ market performance. The app also features candlestick charts for all tickers. Users can view these by tapping on any ticker, and the chart will pop up. With interactive controls and an adjustable timeframe, users and traders can apply data-driven strategies for success. In addition to its SolidProof audit , these features make WallitIQ a potential solution for modern crypto investors, driving confidence. Experts predict WLTQ’s price could climb to $12 post-launch, representing a 34,550% increase. As such, the WallitIQ presale offers an opportunity to potentially secure gains comparable to Dogecoin’s. Conclusion The story of the famous analyst turning Dogecoin into a $30 million success is a testament to the power of early investments in promising projects. With a 34,550% rally predicted for WallitIQ, this Ethereum token could represent the next chapter in crypto success stories.

Per Hanguk Kyungjae , the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), has processed the application of the cryptoasset brokerage platform company Happy Block. VASP License Approval: Opening the Door to Corporate BTC Buying? The approval comes hot on the heels of the FIU’s decision to grant a VASP license to another brokerage – named Waybridge – in late December last year. A South Korean crypto exchange customer trades Bitcoin. (Source: YTN Science Today/YouTube/Screenshot) The FIU operates under the auspices of the country’s top regulator, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) . The unit is the only body in the country with the power to grant companies virtual asset service provider (VASP) licenses. Until the past few weeks, only a handful of crypto exchanges have managed to secure VASP permits. Since Seoul started policing the crypto industry in earnest in 2018, all crypto brokerages have had to shut up shop. However, the FSC appears ready to soften its famously hardline stance on crypto regulation in 2025. The investigators appear to have hit a wall in questioning President Yoon Suk Yeol. https://t.co/j31H8HQEZu #YoonSukYeol #SouhtKorea #Investigation — The Korea Herald 코리아헤럴드 (@TheKoreaHerald) January 20, 2025 Regulator Speaks of ‘Gradual’ Reform The FSC has refused to commit itself to crypto deregulation. But it has suggested it could “review” its policy on allowing companies to buy BTC and other cryptoassets with their balance sheets. The Happy Block approval appears to be a step in this direction. The firm is “a digital assets brokerage company” that launched in May 2022. It calls itself a “digital securities company” and has reportedly been “preparing virtual asset brokerage services for corporations.” Its high-profile backers include SK Securities, and it also has partnership deals with overseas players like Fireblocks and Kaico. The firm is also developing a platform for “institutional investors,” with integrated management, custody, and personal crypto wallet services. It was just minutes after a South Korean court issued a fresh warrant to detain President Yoon Suk Yeol when a group of his supporters turned violent and started storming the courthouse https://t.co/QggOVHyvM7 — Bloomberg Politics (@bpolitics) January 20, 2025 Companies Keen on Crypto The company also plans to provide over-the-counter (OTC) brokerage services for crypto orders and “bulk transactions for institutions.” A wide range of South Korean companies are thought to be keen to buy BTC and other tokens. However, they are currently unable to do so, as FSC guidelines to banks effectively prohibit financial institutions from letting corporate customers open crypto exchange-linked accounts. This is because financial regulators have ruled that virtual assets “are not financial investment products under the terms of the Capital Market Act.” However, the same media outlet wrote that the FSC has “been moving to ease regulations related to virtual assets, albeit slowly, this year.” The FSC has stated that it will be “gradual” with the process. Industry insiders think that public bodies will first be granted the right to sell crypto donations before other firms get the green light. An unnamed South Korean financial investment industry insider told the media outlet: “Currently, even in the US, traditional securities firms do not handle receiving orders for cryptoassets managed by asset management companies.” Financial group chiefs stress Korea's robust fundamentals to offshore investors https://t.co/9yHPJEybTP — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) January 19, 2025 Bitcoin ETF Approval Next? The same insider added that the move could also eventually see the FSC open the door to Bitcoin spot ETF approval. The source said: “If domestic virtual asset ETFs are introduced, there will naturally be a need for bodies who can execute institutional investor orders. Crypto brokerage companies have been preparing for that very role. I believe the FSC approved the [VASP application] because it deemed it necessary [for Bitcoin ETF approval].” However, the FSC has made cagey statements on calls to approve Bitcoin spot ETFs. Earlier this year, the FSC Director Kwon Dae-young said that Bitcoin ETF approval would be going “a step too far.” Gangnam, in Seoul, South Korea.

(Source: Gdog (CC BY-SA 3.0]) But Kwon conceded that the government was “fully aware of the changes [in crypto regulation] that are taking place globally.” Meanwhile, Happy Block CEO Kim Gyu-yoon said that the firm was “planning to pursue business in line with the policy direction of financial regulators.” Kim promised to “respond to major issues such as investor protection , anti-money laundering, and taxation issues.” The CEO also mentioned the need to “carry out business in accordance” with regulators’ “schedule for introducing spot ETFs.” The company’s wait for VASP approval has been a long one. Around a year and five months have passed since Happy Block first submitted its application to the FIU.

At the time of writing, the ETH/BTC trading pair stands at 0.031, marking a four-year low for the ratio. ETH/BTC Continues To Decline As Trump Focuses On Bitcoin Over the past year, Bitcoin has appreciated by an impressive 158%, surging from approximately $41,000 on January 21, 2024, to $107,608 at the time of writing. The cryptocurrency has consistently reached new all-time highs (ATH) throughout the year. In contrast, Ethereum has delivered a modest return of approximately 35% over the same period and remains 32% below its November 2021 ATH of $4,878. Related Reading: Will Ethereum Bounce Back? Crypto Analysts Discuss Potential Price Recovery According to the weekly chart below from TradingView, the ETH/BTC trading pair — also referred to as the ETH/BTC ratio within the crypto industry — has reached a fresh four-year low. This decline has raised concerns about the likelihood of an Ethereum-led altcoin season. Currently trading at 0.031, the ETH/BTC ratio has erased all gains accumulated since March 2021. The pair peaked at 0.087 in December 2021, during the height of that year’s altcoin season. Since then, however, Ethereum, the second-largest digital asset by market capitalization, has experienced a steady decline against Bitcoin. In May 2024, the ratio fell below 0.054, a critical support level that had previously held firm in June 2022. Several factors have contributed to Ethereum’s underperformance, including Trump’s perceived preference for Bitcoin and the rising competition from rival smart-contract platforms like Solana (SOL). Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum has struggled with adoption. Corporations worldwide are increasingly incorporating Bitcoin into their balance sheets, reinforcing BTC’s status as a premier digital asset. Additionally, speculation about the creation of a US strategic Bitcoin reserve has further bolstered the narrative around Bitcoin’s limited supply, driving its price higher. Conversely, Ethereum’s relatively high issuance rate has cast doubt on its “ultrasound money” narrative. Ethereum’s 2024 performance has also eroded confidence among some of its largest holders. Notably, an ETH whale recently sold 10,070 ETH at a $1 million loss, signaling waning investor trust. Will 2025 Change Ethereum’s Fortunes? While 2024 was a challenging year for Ethereum in terms of price performance, crypto analysts remain optimistic about the asset’s prospects in 2025. For example, a report by Steno Research predicts that Ethereum could surge to as high as $8,000 this year. Related Reading: Ethereum Poised For A Bullish Q1 2025? Here’s What Experts Say Similarly, crypto analyst Daan forecasts that the ETH/BTC trading pair could rise above 0.04 during Q1 2025. In December 2024, Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experienced renewed interest from institutional investors, fueling hopes for significant capital inflows into the smart-contract platform. That said, Ethereum must first overcome strong resistance at the $4,000 price level. At press time, ETH trades at $3,368, down 1.3% in the past 24 hours.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Crypto experts select Rollblock as the next potential altcoin star after Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Table of Contents Meme coin favorites still going strong Rollblock steals the show Conclusion Many crypto fans have watched the rise of Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) with great excitement over the past few years. Both tokens grabbed headlines by turning simple memes into global phenomena, driving their market caps to impressive heights. Today, a fresh contender named Rollblock (RBLK) is stepping into the spotlight, drawing attention as a possible multi-billion dollar gem. Enthusiasts searching for the best crypto presales are starting to notice how Rollblock could fuse real online gaming with rewarding tokenomics. Some analysts highlight the project’s focus on transparency and weekly revenue sharing, seeing it as a sign that Rollblock could transform digital gambling. Fans of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu remain curious about whether this newcomer can truly match — or even exceed — meme coin hype. It helps that RBLK stands on solid fundamentals, unlike coins that rely only on internet buzz. Meme coin favorites still going strong Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have both claimed major market positions. With DOGE having a market cap around $53 billion and SHIB at $12 billion, these playful cryptos have proven to be more than a fad. Interestingly, analysts often check the Dogecoin price for signs of renewed surges. Shiba Inu also draws constant attention as the next loved meme coin. However, meme coins face challenges in proving their real-world usefulness. While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu remain symbols of community power, some investors are shifting toward tokens with clear benefits. This movement could give Rollblock and RBLK the opening they need to thrive.

By offering up to 30% of its casino profits to RBLK holders through regular buybacks and burns, Rollblock will create a deflationary effect that can boost token value. Additionally, stakers can earn extra rewards simply by holding their coins. Rollblock is also forging a clear path with licensing, security audits, and advanced features like AI-based betting tools. The focus on fairness and real earnings could make Rollblock a top choice for those who want more than quick speculative profits. With a steady plan to lock team tokens for 24 months, the developers show they are in it for the long haul. Rollblock aims to appeal to everyday users who like online gaming but crave something that offers lasting value. Conclusion In a market that values both fun and utility, Rollblock has a strong chance to capture attention and deliver real results. Thanks to its detailed strategy that rewards token holders, protects user funds, and releases exciting gaming features, RBLK might become the next multi-billion dollar star.

The trader, identified by the Solana address 4zo6…zHF2, exchanged 800,000 USD Coin (USDC) on Jan. 20 and converted it into 16.45 million USDC in just 12 hours, achieving nearly 2000% gains. Another trader reportedly turned $560,000 into $11.5 million by investing in MELANIA, while a third pocketed $47.5 million in profits. These massive gains came as MELANIA’s price soared by 25,600% within 12 hours of its launch across various crypto exchanges. Melania Trump’s verified X account announced the token, which quickly gained traction with around 500,000 holders, according to DEX Screener. The token has also become the 10th most traded cryptocurrency by volume. MELANIA’s meteoric rise coincided with the buzz surrounding Donald Trump’s second-term inauguration and the debut of his own memecoin, Official TRUMP ($TRUMP). The TRUMP token, released shortly before MELANIA, climbed into the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap, reaching a fully diluted value of approximately $50 billion. Concerns About MELANIA’s Transparency Despite its rapid success, MELANIA has faced criticism regarding its token distribution and project transparency. Blockchain analytics platform Bubblemaps revealed that nearly 90% of MELANIA’s supply is controlled by a single wallet, raising doubts about the fairness of its distribution. Additionally, the token’s website, launched a day before its debut, has been criticized for weak cybersecurity and subpar development. Coinbase executive Conor Grogan commented that MELANIA appeared less professionally managed than the TRUMP token, likening it to a project run by “college kids.” While doubts remain about MELANIA’s transparency and execution, its unprecedented gains have fueled excitement and speculation in the crypto space.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,USDC|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-20 23:52:00

Meanwhile, the SUI coin price continues to show volatility, as cryptocurrency analysts monitor its potential to rebound. At BlockDAG, the recruitment of Marius Bock, previously a major figure at Cardano, introduces new leadership and strategic insights to the initiative. BlockDAG (BDAG) has achieved notable progress, and with Bock’s deep experience, it is well-positioned for further achievements. The BDAG coin, now in its presale phase with over $182 million collected, is currently among the top trending crypto assets. Trump’s Policy Expectations Propel Toncoin’s Expansion in the U.S. Market The TON Foundation, linked with Telegram Messenger LLP, is actively pursuing Toncoin (TON) expansion in the United States, encouraged by projected favorable regulatory changes under the new Trump leadership. The foundation’s recent onboarding of Manuel Stotz, an experienced founder of Kingsway Capital Partners Ltd., signifies a major move in strengthening its position in the U.S. As the foundation intensifies its efforts, Toncoin (TON) has captured significant market attention, with its value reflecting growing interest. This strategy highlights the foundation’s readiness to capitalize on expected regulatory developments. Varied Indicators for SUI Coin Price This Week The SUI coin price has experienced fluctuating performance this week, mirroring both prospects and obstacles in the current marketplace. After climbing 10% to $4.76 following Bitcoin’s support at $92,000, the SUI coin price then fell by 4.3%, underscoring its dependency on Bitcoin’s trends. Technical analysts emphasize the significance of the Yearly Open as a pivotal support and the possibilities for further stabilization near Fibonacci retracement levels. With Bitcoin challenging major resistance points, the SUI coin price is under scrutiny for potential upward movements, as the market anticipates a broader bullish trend from leading digital currencies. BlockDAG Accelerates with New Leadership from Former Cardano Executive Marius Bock has joined BlockDAG as Lead Project Manager, bringing extensive expertise from over 25 years in blockchain and fintech. His leadership at Cardano, where he directed the development of cryptocurrency wallet technologies, highlights his proficiency in managing advanced projects. During his tenure at Visa, he led mobile money initiatives across various nations, proving his ability to oversee expansive projects successfully. These experiences demonstrate his skill in delivering significant outcomes within diverse industries and technologies. With Marius at the helm, BlockDAG is poised to fully utilize its capabilities. His experience in leading large teams and implementing scalable projects is set to enhance the network’s structure, paving the way for a robust ecosystem conducive to decentralized applications. Marius’s efforts to upgrade the network’s functions will ensure BlockDAG remains a preferred platform for developers and users alike, promoting wider acceptance and steady growth. His strategic leadership is anticipated to significantly boost the reliability and market competitiveness of the BlockDAG ecosystem. BlockDAG has already marked significant achievements, with its BDAG coin presale garnering over $182 million and selling 17.9 billion coins, experiencing a remarkable price increase of 2380%, from $0.001 to $0.0248 across 27 batches. As the mainnet launch draws near later this year, the chance to buy BDAG at presale prices is diminishing quickly. As BlockDAG continues to reach new heights, it solidifies its status as a top trending crypto, drawing increasing interest from traders keen on joining its swift growth. Market Developments to Watch As Toncoin’s (TON) expansion progresses in the U.S., the scenario looks promising due to anticipated supportive regulations with the Trump administration. The SUI coin price also seems promising, attracting market attention due to its potential for recovery. Yet, the spotlight is on BlockDAG, particularly with Marius Bock’s impactful entry. His leadership, combined with the team’s strategic plans, propels BlockDAG towards further growth. Now in the 27th batch of a highly successful presale, the BDAG coin has raised over $182 million, showing immense potential for growth. With a solid groundwork laid, it has become a top trending crypto , making this an opportune moment to engage before its value soars.

Cardano Enhances Governance & Solana Rolls Out a Memecoin,https://thecoinrise.com/investors-rave-over-web3bay-blockchain-transforms-e-commerce-cardano-enhances-governance-solana-rolls-out-a-memecoin/,"The cryptocurrency landscape is busy as Cardano rolls out its latest governance features and Solana’s meme coin, TRUMP, amplifies its market presence. Meanwhile, Web3Bay (3BAY) has captured the imagination and excitement of investors by uniquely merging blockchain technology with e-commerce. This integration promises to revolutionize the shopping experience, offering secure, transparent transactions and significant perks for token holders. Priced attractively at just $0.0045626 in its ongoing fourth presale stage, Web3Bay has already raised $830,000 and sold 220 million tokens, signaling strong market confidence and setting up early investors for an impressive potential ROI of 6,430%. Cardano Advances: Enhancing Security & Engagement Cardano has seen noteworthy price volatility, reaching highs of $1.16 and lows of $1.054, with a recent trading price of $1.061. The implementation of the Chang hard fork marks a significant milestone in Cardano’s development towards decentralized governance, enhancing user engagement in decision-making processes. These enhancements are designed to solidify Cardano’s position in the crypto market by promoting a more democratic governance model and potentially fostering new collaborations and partnerships. This focus on decentralized governance is expected to enhance the platform’s resilience against security threats and increase its appeal to a broader base of developers. Additionally, Cardano’s commitment to regular updates and community involvement positions it as a leader in sustainable and scalable blockchain solutions. Solana’s Market Surge: The Impact of TRUMP Memecoin Solana’s recent trading figures are impressive, with a current price of $240.47, having achieved highs of $243.26 and lows of $216.47. The launch of the TRUMP meme coin has not only increased Solana’s market cap to nearly $9 billion but also significantly enhanced its visibility in the crypto space. This surge in attention could be further bolstered by favorable regulatory developments expected with the new pro-crypto administration, potentially leading to the approval of cryptocurrency ETFs that could attract more institutional investors to Solana. The platform’s high throughput and low transaction costs make it an ideal choice for developers looking to build scalable applications, contributing to its rapid growth in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. As Solana continues to develop and integrate new features, it is poised to become a major player in the blockchain ecosystem, competing directly with more established platforms. Secure, Scalable, & Affordable: Web3Bay’s Tech Sets New Standards During the dynamic shifts in the cryptocurrency sector, Web3Bay stands out by effectively merging blockchain technology with e-commerce. This strategic integration not only streamlines transactions but also fortifies security, setting a new benchmark for online retail. The platform’s advanced design supports scalable growth through the use of smart contracts and decentralized protocols, enhancing transactional efficiency and reliability. Web3Bay’s current presale, now in its fourth stage, has successfully raised $830,000 and sold 220 million tokens, demonstrating robust investor confidence and market potential. Priced at just $0.0045626 per token, Web3Bay is making a compelling case as an affordable yet promising investment opportunity in the digital marketplace. Web3Bay’s blockchain framework provides a secure and transparent environment where users can enjoy benefits such as 5% discounts on purchases and governance rights, which enhance user engagement and loyalty. By adopting innovative technologies like NFTs and offering tokenized rewards, Web3Bay is not just revolutionizing the e-commerce landscape but is also setting the stage for a new era of digital commerce that prioritizes consumer empowerment and security. As the platform continues to expand its offerings and user base, the demand for 3BAY tokens is expected to rise, potentially leading to significant gains for early investors. These presale achievements and the strategic advantages offered by Web3Bay highlight its potential to reshape and dominate the e-commerce sector through blockchain innovation. Wrapping Up While projects like Cardano and Solana continue to draw attention with their respective innovations and speculative appeal, Web3Bay focuses on delivering long-term value through a utility-driven approach. By eliminating common e-commerce challenges such as high transaction fees and centralization, Web3Bay not only enhances the shopping experience but also paves the way for the future of decentralized retail. With $830,000 already raised and innovative features like NFT integration and staking on the horizon, Web3Bay is not just another crypto token; it’s at the forefront of transforming how we think about buying and selling in the digital world. For investors seeking a blend of innovation, scalability, and solid returns, Web3Bay offers a compelling option, marking it as a leader in the next evolution of e-commerce.

XRP price surges 42% in a week XRP has grabbed headlines over the past seven days after becoming the best-performing altcoin in the top 10. On January 9, the XRP price was hovering around $2.32. After holding this level for days, the XRP price spiked sharply on January 14 due to increasing demand from traders. This demand came as the SEC neared the January 15 deadline to file its appeals brief in its case against Ripple Labs and its executives. As a result of increased trading activity, the XRP price reclaimed the $3 level, which was last seen in 2018. The XRP price went as high as $3.36 on January 16 before stabilizing around $3.32.

However, analysts believe this altcoin might soon reverse course and retest key support levels. Meanwhile, RCO Finance (RCOF), a new DeFi altcoin, has quickly gained popularity after securing over $11.19 million in funding during its presale. Which altcoin is poised to generate the highest returns between Dogecoin (DOGE) and RCO Finance (RCOF)? Read on to find out! Dogecoin Price Climbs 15% In A Week: What’s Next? Dogecoin has recorded notable gains over the past week. On January 9, the Dogecoin price was hovering around $0.3312. The Dogecoin price traded around this range for days before gaining momentum on January 15. This spike came after data from TradingView revealed that whales accumulated 470 million DOGE in 48 hours. This whale activity attracted hordes of traders, and the Dogecoin price soared as high as $0.3866 on January 16 before stabilizing at around $0.3841. This price means Dogecoin has gained 15% over the past week. However, analysts expect the Dogecoin price to correct downward and retest the $0.3500 support level as the buzz about the recent whale activity wanes. This explains why investors are shifting to RCO Finance (RCOF).

RCOF has captured investor attention because it has showcased impressive growth during its ongoing presale. As of January 16, RCOF had secured over $11.19 million in funding. Amazingly, RCOF has managed to raise these funds despite being in Stage 4 of its presale. RCOF’s price during this stage is $0.0778. This price is set to jump to $0.2142 when RCOF enters the Bonus Round, with more growth coming as this AI altcoin approaches its listing price of $0.4-$0.6.

Significant events are generating headlines for two of the biggest participants in the cryptocurrency space: Ethereum and Solana. The true action, however, is elsewhere: the smart investors are taking notice of Remittix (RTX) , a low-cap gem with the potential for phenomenal growth. Ethereum Upgrade Fuels Market Optimism The cryptocurrency economy has long relied on Ethereum and 2025 is expected to be another significant year. Significant improvements to the ecosystem are anticipated with the March Pectra Ethereum upgrade. From improved wallet functionality and account abstraction to advancements in zero knowledge cryptography, Pectra is poised to elevate Ethereum’s user experience, privacy and scalability. Core developers have already begun rolling out the Sepolia and Holesky features on Ethereum’s testnets. If everything goes as planned, the Ethereum upgrade might encourage additional users to sign up, further solidifying Ethereum's position as the industry leader in DeFi. Strong institutional interest is demonstrated by the net inflow of $166.6 million into Ethereum ETFs, which coincides with the technical improvements. Ethereum is battling resistance close to $3,400, displaying an inverted head and shoulders pattern that suggests bullish momentum. According to analysts, ETH may repeat its all time high of $4,868 following a breakout and if it maintains above significant resistance levels, it may even hit $6,000 in the future. However, in order to continue its bullish claim, the altcoin need to hold onto support close to $2,817. Solana Rides Meme Coin Hype The Solana network has performed exceptionally well, as seen by its price increase of nearly 32% to $253.22 in the last week. The surge is as a result of increased Solana network activity brought on by the introduction of a Trump meme coin that has taken liquidity away from other markets. This change has temporarily disrupted operations and because of the large volume of transactions, Binance recently paused SOL withdrawals, leaving customers anxious for regular operations to resume. The Solana network’s strong ecosystem and capacity to draw in liquidity make it a strong contender in the Layer-1 blockchain market despite this setback. Investors are making a bag from Solana's price momentum as it continues to surge. However, experienced traders are searching for more stable options, like Remittix because the meme coin hype rarely lasts. Why Remittix Could Be the Breakout Star of 2025 An increasing number of whales are turning their attention to Remittix (RTX) , a cutting edge payment network that combines blockchain technology with fiat transactions, even if Ethereum and Solana continue to dominate headlines. By allowing users to send bitcoin and have receivers receive fiat money straight into their bank accounts, Remittix provides a smooth cross border payment option. Remittix has raised over $3.7 million with a price of just $0.0221 during its presale phase, garnering recognition for its innovative strategy. The platform offers unmatched flexibility and financial inclusion by supporting more than 40 cryptocurrencies and 40 fiat currencies. Customers can avoid dealing with the hidden fees and bad exchange rates that are frequently connected to conventional banks and payment systems thanks to the platform’s clear flat fee model. What sets Remittix apart is its potential to disrupt the $183 trillion global payments industry. By combining blockchain technology with local payment networks, Remittix enables faster, cheaper and more secure transactions. Its API solutions, such as “Remittix Pay,” empower businesses and freelancers to accept crypto payments while settling in fiat, minimizing exposure to market volatility. Investors are particularly excited about the long term potential of RTX. With forecasts of a 25x multiplier during the presale and 1,500% gains after launch, Remittix is poised for exponential growth. Its smart contract has passed a full audit and plans to lock liquidity and team tokens for three years ensure transparency and stability. Conclusion Ethereum and Solana remain giants in the cryptocurrency market, with their respective developments promising substantial returns for investors. However, the real opportunity may lie in emerging projects like Remittix. Combining the best of traditional finance and blockchain technology, Remittix is redefining cross border payments and positioning itself as a leader in the PayFi space.

Major developments are capturing attention for two of the main players in the crypto world: Ethereum and Solana. Yet, the real action is happening elsewhere as savvy investors turn their gaze to Remittix (RTX) , a low-cap asset with the potential for remarkable growth. Ethereum's Upgrade Sparks Optimism Ethereum has been a cornerstone of the crypto economy, and 2025 is shaping up to be another pivotal year. The upcoming March Pectra upgrade promises significant enhancements to the Ethereum ecosystem. With features like improved wallet capabilities, account abstraction, and advances in zero-knowledge cryptography, Pectra aims to boost Ethereum's user experience, privacy, and scalability. Core developers have already started implementing Sepolia and Holesky on Ethereum testnets. If successful, the upgrade could attract more users, reinforcing Ethereum's role as a leader in decentralized finance. The $166.6 million net inflow into Ethereum ETFs, coupled with these technical upgrades, reflects strong institutional interest. Currently, Ethereum is facing resistance around $3,400, showing an inverted head and shoulders pattern that hints at bullish momentum. Analysts suggest that ETH could retest its previous peak of $4,868 after a breakout, and if it stays above key resistance levels, it might even reach $6,000. However, to sustain its upward trajectory, the altcoin needs to maintain support around $2,817. Solana Leverages Meme Coin Buzz Solana has been on a roll, with its price jumping nearly 32% to $253.22 over the past week. This surge is due to heightened activity on the Solana network, spurred by the launch of a Trump meme coin that has diverted liquidity from other markets. This shift has temporarily disrupted operations, and due to the high transaction volume, Binance recently paused SOL withdrawals, causing users to eagerly await the return to normal operations. Despite this hiccup, Solana's robust ecosystem and ability to attract liquidity make it a formidable competitor in the Layer-1 blockchain market. Investors are capitalizing on Solana's price momentum, but seasoned traders are also eyeing more stable options like Remittix, as the meme coin excitement is often short-lived. The Potential for Remittix to Shine in 2025 An increasing number of whales are shifting their focus to Remittix (RTX) , an innovative payment network that merges blockchain tech with fiat transactions, even though Ethereum and Solana continue to dominate the headlines. Remittix offers a seamless cross-border payment solution by allowing users to send bitcoin while recipients receive fiat directly into their bank accounts. During its presale phase, Remittix has already attracted over $3.7 million, priced at just $0.0221, thanks to its groundbreaking approach. Supporting more than 40 cryptocurrencies and 40 fiat currencies, the platform provides unmatched flexibility and financial inclusion.

Lord Barron Trump (BARTRUMP), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because BARTRUMP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Lord Barron Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Lord Barron Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Lord Barron Trump launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Lord Barron Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Lord Barron Trump by entering its contract address – D1na43rvB8ANQYK5KNJuYNK9RrAPaz9zevLGzw8DyZae – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like BARTRUMP. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|DOGE|SOL|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-21 00:06:00

But as is often the case in crypto, things haven't gone as planned for Dogecoin and the asset has been plummeting over the past 24 hours. On the sidelines, a rival altcoin at $0.0221 is emerging, that may soon eclipse Dogecoin. Remittix(RTX) is a revolutionary PayFi solution currently seeing major attention in its presale with its practical fixes for cross-border payment problems. Unlike Dogecoin (DOGE), Remittix is built around real-world practicality, and is taking the market by storm, with $3.85 million raised to date. So will Dogecoin (DOGE) bounce back from the brink, and how will Remittixfare this year? Dogecoin Sees Worrying 24 Hour Dip Dogecoin (DOGE) has wobbled its way through January, with some sporadic and short growth spurts throughout, most often preceding small dips. The weekly net gain for Dogecoin (DOGE) is now sitting at 15.38% but the asset has seen a rough 24 hours, dropping by 4.56%. Dogecoin is now trading at $0.3938 and its $7.26 billion 24 hour trading volume suggests many holders are selling off while others may be buying the dip. Much like other meme coins in the space, Dogecoin’s trajectory looks very uncertain as we settle into 2025. Remittix (RTX) Raises the Bar for Global Payments Remittix (RTX) combines the best features of blockchain and traditional banking to offer seamless crypto-to-fiat transactions. It facilitates the conversion of over 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat currencies and enables users to send funds to any global bank account with ease. Unlike traditional systems that often impose hidden fees, Remittix operates with a transparent flat-rate pricing model, ensuring recipients receive exactly what was sent. Unlike legacy systems, Remittix (RTX) eliminates hidden fees with its flat-rate pricing model. This model ensures that what users send is exactly what recipients receive, making it a more affordable and transparent solution than traditional banking options. Its instant transaction settlements are another key draw, offering users and businesses a reliable way to move funds across the globe. The Remittix Pay API is a major selling point for businesses, simplifying crypto payment acceptance and fiat settlement, allowing merchants to work effectively within the digital economy. Companies can even set up merchant accounts to manage conversions in over 30 fiat currencies and 50+ cryptocurrency pairs, offering optimal flexibility so that businesses can manage their finances in a way that works for them. Remittix’s vision extends beyond remittances, as it looks to bridge the gap between blockchain and real-world financial applications. The modular nature of the PayFi protocol means that it can integrate easily with different financial systems, which will allow it to scale in the future. Remittix Soars Past $3.75 Million Raised In Presale $RTX tokens are currently up for grabs in the presale for just $0.0221. The presale continues to build momentum, having raised more than $3.85 million from investors who see its massive potential to disrupt the $190 trillion global banking industry. Projections point to a800% price jump by the close of the presale and a possible 5,000% rally post-launch, making it one of the most promising opportunities in PayFi for 2025.

However, as often happens in the crypto world, Dogecoin's journey has been rocky, and the asset has been on a downward trend over the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, an emerging competitor altcoin, priced at $0.0221, is gaining traction and might soon surpass Dogecoin. Remittix(RTX) is an innovative PayFi solution that is attracting considerable attention during its presale due to its practical solutions for international payment challenges. Unlike Dogecoin (DOGE), Remittix is grounded in real-world utility and is capturing market interest, having already raised $3.85 million. Can Dogecoin (DOGE) recover from its current slump, and what does the future hold for Remittix this year? Dogecoin Faces a Concerning 24-Hour Decline Dogecoin (DOGE) has had a turbulent start to January, with intermittent bursts of growth often followed by small declines. Currently, Dogecoin (DOGE) boasts a weekly net gain of 15.38%, but it has experienced a challenging 24-hour period, with a drop of 4.56%. The cryptocurrency is now valued at $0.3938, and its trading volume over the past 24 hours has reached $7.26 billion, indicating a mix of holders selling and others taking advantage of the dip. Much like other meme coins in the cryptocurrency realm, Dogecoin's future trajectory remains highly uncertain as we progress into 2025. Remittix (RTX) Sets New Standards for International Transactions Remittix (RTX) blends the best of blockchain technology with traditional banking to facilitate smooth crypto-to-fiat exchanges.

However, in just a few days, the coin is already attracting legal and tax scrutiny. Fintax has highlighted three serious concerns about the launch of TRUMP. Critical among them is whether TRUMP qualifies as a security under US regulations. The US Security and Exchange Commission states that digital assets supplied through initial coin offerings (ICO) are qualified as securities as long as they meet the Howey Test Criteria. ICOs always make money by issuing crypto and pledging future returns. TRUMP has been launched publicly, but the team indicated on the TRUMP website that the coin isn’t a security. Besides, it has not alleged any future profits, making it difficult to call the meme coin a security. The SEC has not pronounced itself on the meme coin, but if TRUMP begins to act like a security, it will be under the SEC’s scrutiny and regulations. TRUMP is facing tax scrutiny, with the team holding up to 80% of the coin According to the IRS , profits from crypto investments are subject to capital tax. Trump’s team holds 80% of the meme coin supply, which will be unlocked periodically over the next three years. There is a dilemma on whether the unlocking event is taxable. US tax laws direct that capital gain tax takes effect when assets are sold or traded. Therefore, unlocking TRUMP won’t be taxable unless they are sold or used in transactions. The moment TRUMP is traded or exchanged into other assets, it will definitely attract capital gains based on the market price. Also, figuring out the cornerstone of TRUMP cost is a challenge. The US laws ensure that capital gains tax is pegged to the price at which you bought the asset. TRUMP has had wild price swings, making it impossible to establish the cost basis. If the team behind TRUMP sells the cryptos in sets, the capital gains will be calculated based on the timing and market prices of the batches. This makes it difficult to file taxes if proper sales records are not kept well. TRUMP could breach the law if used for political donations The meme coin is considered a potential controversy when it comes to political donations. The US law on Transparency and limits of political donations is very strict. If TRUMP is used to generate political funds, it could easily go past the set limits and break the law. Although there is no evidence of the coin being used for political donation, the idea of a politician launching a meme coin could have serious repercussions on the political donation systems.

Unlike other meme coins, however, the income from the sale of the coin will be used to pay off the U.S. national debt. Cuban laid out his plans on X, saying that the meme coin would work similarly to the $TRUMP token, with only 20% of it being available for trading and the release schedule being identical to the $TRUMP coin. Cuban stated, “If meme coins are the way, maybe I’ll issue one. With a twist. Same terms as $TRUMP. 20% float. Same release schedule. One difference: All the revenue from the sale of the coins goes to the U.S. Treasury.” He stated that the initiative is to leverage meme coin speculation to solve the U.S debt. Cuban added, “If you want to gamble, gamble. But at least use it to make a dent in the U.S. debt.” Cuban also confirmed the project’s transparency, as the Treasury’s wallet address will be shared, where the funds can be tracked. Cuban questions TRUMP coin’s impact on crypto industry In another post on X, Cuban Brought attention to the TRUMP coin, stating that its poor start will only make it difficult for the digital asset market to gain credibility. He cited concerns about the future of TRUMP and opined that the coin could jeopardize the ongoing process of regulating digital assets properly. Cuban referred to the growing pressure among American legislators to define new cryptocurrency rules. He also mentioned the FIT21 Act, which can help determine the legal status of digital assets. However, Cuban said that the launch of TRUMP is bad for the industry because it encourages investors to purchase tokens without fully understanding what they are purchasing. Cuban said, “Gary Gensler has got to be laughing his ass off,” referring to the SEC’s former chair. The creation of TRUMP and MELANIA tokens by the U.S. President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump just days prior to the president’s inauguration has raised conflict of interest issues. Although Trump has declared that his children will manage his assets after his inauguration, the creation of these tokens raises new ethical questions. The firms that created TRUMP and MELANIA said that these are not investments or securities but only an “expression of support.” These tokens come after other products with the Trump brand on them such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), sneakers, and even a Bible.

With a revolutionary approach to real estate tokenization, PCHAIN is transforming the $600 trillion property investment market. This innovation has fueled a surge in investor confidence, driving its market performance to unprecedented heights. Top traders and market analysts predict an unprecedented 55,000% upside for PCHAIN , eclipsing the XRP and Cardano price actions. The platform’s ability to bridge the gap between real estate and digital assets has positioned it as a formidable contender in the crypto market. Unlike traditional crypto assets like XRP and Cardano , which primarily serve as mediums of exchange or smart contract platforms, PropiChain introduces tangible asset backing through real estate. As adoption grows and its ecosystem expands, many experts believe PCHAIN’s current trajectory could lead to one of the most significant parabolic rallies in crypto history, outpacing even some of the industry’s biggest names like XRP and Cardano. The Rise of PropiChain PropiChain’s rise has been nothing short of spectacular. Unlike many speculative crypto assets, this project offers a tangible use case by integrating blockchain with real estate, a multi-trillion-dollar industry ripe for disruption. Through tokenized property ownership, PCHAIN allows investors to buy, sell, and trade fractional shares of real estate assets, eliminating traditional barriers such as high entry costs, legal complexities, and geographical restrictions. This unique value proposition has resonated with both retail and institutional investors. Over the past few months, trading volume for the token presale has skyrocketed, surpassing well-established projects like XRP and Cardano. The increased activity has also led to a rapid rise in demand for PCHAIN, further solidifying its position as a top-performing crypto asset ahead of XRP and Cardano. Why Traders Are Betting on PCHAIN’s 55,000% Upside The prediction of a parabolic 55,000% increase in PropiChain’s value is based on several compelling factors: Mass Adoption in Real Estate Inefficiencies, including slow transactions, high fees, and opaque ownership structures, have long plagued the real estate industry. PropiChain’s smart contract-enabled transactions provide a more efficient and secure way to buy and sell properties, increasing adoption rates among investors and real estate firms. Institutional Interest and Partnerships Major real estate companies and financial institutions have started exploring partnerships with PropiChain. These collaborations are expected to drive significant capital into the ecosystem, increasing the utility and demand for PCHAIN. Additionally, with the RWA tokenization projected to rise to $16 trillion , PCHAIN is positioned as a potential game-changer in the market. As an RWA altcoin, the token bridges the gap between the real estate market and the blockchain. A Shift in Investor Sentiment With crypto assets like XRP and Cardano readily impacted by market volatility, investors are looking for real-world utility projects rather than speculative assets. PCHAIN’s integration with real estate positions it as a high-value, low-risk investment compared to other volatile altcoins. Comparing PCHAIN to XRP and Cardano While XRP and Cardano have been dominant forces in the crypto space, emerging projects like PCHAIN are poised to take center stage with a staggering 55,000% growth potential. Despite its utility in cross-border payments, XRP has struggled due to regulatory challenges, including its ongoing legal battle with the SEC. Cardano, on the other hand, has been criticized for its slow development and limited adoption of smart contract capabilities. In contrast, PropiChain is swiftly executing its roadmap and achieving multiple new milestones. The project’s clear use case, strong adoption rates, and exponential growth potential give it an edge over already established projects like XRP and ADA. PropiChain: A New Frontier in the Real Estate Market PropiChain is transforming the real estate industry by using cutting-edge technology to redefine property transactions. The platform revolutionizes how real estate is bought, sold, and invested worldwide through four groundbreaking innovations. Immersive Virtual Property Exploration The platform harnesses Metaverse technology to revolutionize property scouting for investors and buyers. By offering highly interactive 3D virtual tours, the platform enables remote property scouting, breaking down geographical barriers and making real estate investments more accessible than ever before. This approach also facilitates greater transparency and seamless communication between buyers and sellers. It eliminates logistical hurdles common in traditional real estate dealings. Investors can assess properties in real time without physical site visits, reducing costs and time. Smart Contracts for Secure and Automated Transactions PCHAIN employs blockchain-powered smart contracts that automate crucial real estate processes. These self-executing digital agreements manage lease contracts, ownership transfers, and rental payments, reducing reliance on intermediaries such as brokers and agents. AI-Powered Investment PCHAIN integrates artificial intelligence to refine real estate investment strategies. The platform’s AI-driven virtual assistants and chatbots offer 24/7 support, assisting investors in navigating the market with ease. Additionally, the AI system evaluates market trends, forecasts property value shifts, and provides data-backed recommendations. This empowers investors with valuable insights to enhance profitability while mitigating risks. Real Estate Tokenization for Greater Investment Access Through the tokenization of Real-World Assets (RWA), PropiChain converts physical properties into digital assets. This enables fractional ownership of high-value real estate, enhancing liquidity in the market, democratizing investment opportunities, and broadening participation among global investors. Conclusion PCHAIN’s rapid rise past XRP and ADA shows the growing demand for blockchain projects with real-world utility. With a potential 55,000% market upside, traders and investors are joining the ongoing presale. According to top market analysts, your modest $1000 investment in the presale could yield over $384,570 ROI in Q1 2025. The first presale raised over $1.3 million, and the ongoing second presale has crossed the $940,000 mark. After this presale, the token price will rise by over 109%. Join the presale now to enjoy massive gains and a low entry price. PCHAIN is listed on CoinMarketCap , increasing the token’s availability and accessibility to potential investors. BlockAudit, a top blockchain security company, audited the smart contract and found no loophole or vulnerability.

At the same time, Shiba Inu whale activity has exploded by an incredible 830%, fueling speculation about its potential influence on SHIB’s pricing path. Amid this market buzz, BlockDAG (BDAG) is in the spotlight with its ambitious plan to secure listings on 10 tier-two and tier-three CEXs. This strategic move is poised to drastically enhance liquidity and adoption, with market analysts setting their sights on a possible $20 target for BDAG in the near future, as these listings elevate its market footprint and secure its position as a top trending crypto. Avalanche’s Bullish Sentiment Hits New Highs with 7% Price Surge The Avalanche (AVAX) bullish sentiment is reaching new heights as the cryptocurrency sees a 7.2% daily spike in price, reaching $35.90. This rally follows its bounce back from the 200-day EMA and the lower boundary of a falling wedge pattern, igniting optimism across the market. Moreover, Avalanche is making waves with robust social engagement, emerging as a frontrunner among Real World Asset (RWA) projects with 8.1k posts and 1.9M interactions. Rising Open Interest and trading volumes are signaling intense investor interest, raising the stakes for a possible breakout toward $40, with longer-term targets potentially soaring to $50 or beyond. Shiba Inu Whale Activity Skyrockets 830% in Just One Day Shiba Inu whale activity has skyrocketed by an astonishing 830%, driven by a significant uptick in both inflows and outflows from heavyweight wallets. On-chain data shows over 1.06 trillion SHIB tokens were moved by large holders, marking a 475% increase in just 24 hours. Despite this, the net inflows remained robust at 1.44 trillion SHIB, indicating heavy trading among major players. This surge in Shiba Inu’s whale activity raises the question: is this indicative of selling pressure or a strategic shuffle? As many of these transactions involve exchanges, this heightened activity could critically shape SHIB’s price direction in the days ahead. Why 10 CEX Listings Might Rocket BlockDAG to a $20 Valuation BlockDAG is setting up for a major breakthrough by aiming to list its BDAG token on 10 pivotal tier-two and tier-three centralized exchanges (CEX). This ambitious move is designed to boost the token’s visibility and liquidity, opening it to fresh markets and wider audiences. Expanding access through these listings is expected to draw both retail and institutional interest, sparking increased activity within the ecosystem. As BDAG becomes more accessible, surging demand is likely to drive notable price growth and cement its market stance. Equipped with DAG-based ledger technology, BlockDAG is ready for the expected uptick in adoption following the listings. The network’s capability for high-speed transactions and low fees ensures it can manage the influx of new users and increased trade volumes effectively. The scalability of BlockDAG’s framework is ideally matched with the upcoming liquidity and exposure from these listings, guaranteeing the network can accommodate rising demand without a hitch. BlockDAG’s forthcoming exchange debuts could ignite a significant price rally, building on BDAG’s already remarkable presale achievements. Currently priced at $0.0248 in its 27th presale batch, BDAG has surged 2380% from its initial offering price of $0.001. The network’s total presale revenue has already topped $182 million with over 17.9 billion coins sold. Market watchers now believe BDAG could reach a $20 valuation by 2027, propelled by the increased demand and liquidity following the listings. Missing out on this presale phase means snagging BDAG at elevated prices later, as its debut on 10 exchanges will undoubtedly position BlockDAG as a top trending crypto powerhouse. Which Crypto Will Trend Next? As AVAX’s bullish sentiment strengthens, its recent price rally underscores solid investor confidence and hints at further upside. Shiba Inu’s whale activity, marked by an impressive 830% increase, continues to captivate attention, leaving traders keen to witness its impact on SHIB’s future market value. Yet, all eyes are on BlockDAG, set to become a top trending crypto with its bold strategy to list on 10 CEXs. This audacious move is expected to ramp up liquidity, spur adoption, and potentially push BDAG toward the anticipated $20 mark. With BDAG’s presale price standing at a mere $0.0248 in batch 27, seizing this crypto presale moment is an exhilarating prospect not to be overlooked.

This development came as the DOGE price crashed violently after climbing to as high as $0.43 on Sunday. Dogecoin Traders Lose Over $60 Million In 24 Hours Coinglass data shows that Dogecoin traders have lost over $65 million in the last 24 hours. Traders who went long on DOGE suffered the most, with $54.81 million in long positions liquidated during this period. Short traders accounted for the remaining loss, with $7.90 in short positions liquidated. Related Reading: Dogecoin ‘Power Of 3’ Pattern Enters Distribution Phase: Massive Bull Run Incoming? These short liquidations likely occurred earlier on Sunday, when the Dogecoin price reclaimed the $0.40 support level and rebounded to as high as $0.43. However, the price action took a drastic turn later in the day, crashing from the intra-day high of around $0.43 to as low as $0.35, leading to the flush in long positions. Dogecoin traders weren’t the only ones who suffered significant losses. Other crypto traders lost substantial sums as the crypto market witnessed its largest liquidation event this year, with over $1 billion liquidated in the last 24 hours, according to Coinglass data. Long traders took the most hit, with $903.59 million in long positions liquidated. Meanwhile, $260 million in short positions were liquidated. These liquidations occurred as the Bitcoin price dropped from as high as $106,000 to $100,000, dragging other coins, including Dogecoin, along with it. This price drop across the board occurred mainly due to the US First Lady Melania Trump’s launch of her meme coin, ‘MELANIA,’ which drained liquidity from other coins in the market. Dogecoin traders were also bound to take a significant hit considering DOGE’s strong price correlation with BTC. As such, a Dogecoin price crash was inevitable as the flagship crypto nosedived to as low as $100,000. The Cycle Is Not Over Crypto analyst Kevin Capital provided optimism for Dogecoin traders, stating that the cycle is not over. The analyst also reminded those upset at Donald Trump and his team about the ‘TRUMP’ and ‘MELANIA’ meme coins that Dogecoin could easily have remained at $0.11 if the incoming president had not won the elections instead of Kamala Harris. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts When Dogecoin Price Will Hit $3 This Cycle As such, he urged Dogecoin investors and traders to be grateful for how far DOGE has come since November 5th, 2024, when Trump won the elections. Indeed, Trump’s victory was the primary catalyst for Dogecoin’s gains last year. The foremost meme coin had maintained a tepid price action for most of last year until Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E), coined from DOGE, looked likely to come to life as Trump led the polls. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.36, down over 8% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Pseudonymous analyst Rekt Capital tells his 531,500 followers on the social media platform X that the altcoin market is at a stage where it is being overlooked by most traders. But the trader notes that the prevailing bearish sentiment is setting the stage for altcoins to ignite upside bursts, leaving many traders on the sidelines. “February has been a strong month for altcoins in both 2023 and 2024. Could altcoins enjoy a strong February for the third year in a row? If so, then altcoins should be close to their ‘Lowest Hype’ areas before preceding upside over the coming weeks.” Source: Rekt Capital/X Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that altcoins are presenting prime entry opportunities for investors before alts top out in April. Looking at Solana, the trader believes that SOL is in the process of flipping a strong resistance level into support after closing the previous trading week at around $252. “Solana has managed to not only reclaim its re-accumulation range but also break out from it. On the cusp of fully confirming a breakout from its re-accumulation range. Just needs a weekly close above $250 followed by a possible post-breakout retest.” Source: Rekt Capital/X At time of writing, SOL is trading for $260, above the trader’s weekly resistance level.

Technical analysis from Ali Martinez suggests a potential bullish breakout as the cryptocurrency forms a falling wedge pattern, indicating possible price recovery after consolidation. TRUMP Meme Coin Forms Bullish Pattern Amid $54 Breakout Crypto analyst Ali Martinez observed a falling wedge pattern forming on lower timeframes for the TRUMP meme coin. This technical pattern is often regarded as a bullish reversal signal, with diminishing selling pressure and a likelihood of a breakout. Martinez forecasts that after a consolidation phase near the wedge’s apex, the new meme coin could rebound toward $54, reflecting an upward momentum. Following the meme coin launch , the TRUMP token experienced intense market activity, reaching a 24-hour high of $60. By the day’s end, it had declined to $40.25, reflecting a sharp drop in value. This 11% price drop, was accompanied by $31.82 billion in trading volume, suggesting heightened trader interest despite the downturn. Falling Wedge Signals Potential Reversal The falling wedge pattern observed in the TRUMP meme coin signals a reduction in selling pressure, indicating a forthcoming bullish move. This consolidation phase is crucial in determining the token’s next direction. The token’s market capitalization currently stands at $8.05 billion, with a circulating supply of 200 million tokens. The high trading activity and reduced selling pressure add to the potential reversal. Source: X However, despite the bullish prediction, the meme coin price saw its value drop sharply to $35.87, a 27.33% decline in 24 hours. Meme Coin Launch Raises Concerns The TRUMP meme coin, launched during inauguration festivities, has sparked regulatory and ethical concerns. Four-fifths of the token supply is reportedly controlled by affiliated entities, raising questions about market manipulation. Critics argue that such high ownership concentration could influence the token’s price movements and long-term stability. More so, a recent CNBC report revealed how the inauguration weekend made the first family billions of dollars richer. The TRUMP meme coin, launched Friday night, soared to a $14 billion market cap. $MELANIA, launched Sunday, reached $2 billion in value. World Liberty Financial, endorsed by the family, raised over $300 million through token sales, further boosting their net worth. Additionally, while the token’s launch gained attention, some analysts caution against speculative investments in meme coins due to their volatility. Mark Cuban contributed to the building concerns, stating that the meme coin poses regulatory and ethical challenges, particularly with President Donald Trump serving as both issuer and investor. He highlighted the conflict of interest this creates, warning it could confuse regulators and undermine investor confidence. Cuban further criticized the lack of safeguards for investors and argued that such projects risk damaging the crypto industry’s efforts Despite the excitement around the TRUMP meme coin, President Donald Trump did not mention cryptocurrencies in his inauguration speech.

Queen Melania Trump (MELQUE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MELQUE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Queen Melania Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Queen Melania Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Queen Melania Trump launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Queen Melania Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Queen Melania Trump by entering its contract address – FLQiU6SnMoM6HKN5cQqk32Cx9CY7StiBZuVyXRQ4fxCa – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MELQUE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|DOGE|SOL|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-21 01:23:00

The entrepreneur has left the position at DOGE to run for governor of Ohio. According to a person close to Ramaswamy, who was granted anonymity to speak freely, the politician will launch a campaign for governor early next week. Multiple sources confirmed to CBS News that the entrepreneur’s exit was due to his “lack of participation in the heavy lifting” at DOGE. Ramaswamy leaves DOGE amid frictions between him and staff 🚨BREAKING: Vivek Ramaswamy Out At DOGE Sources say he 'didn't do the heavy lifting, created friction with others, and wore out his welcome.' He sounds like the typical H-1B after all! 🤣 pic.twitter.com/uKNedQkoED — Sam Parker 🇺🇸🧯 (@BasedSamParker) January 19, 2025 After Trump’s inauguration today, DOGE is one of the projects he is pushing for in his second term. The 47th U.S. president had planned for the project to reduce government spending by up to $2 trillion by July 4, 2026. Ramaswamy was tasked with leading Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency alongside tech entrepreneur Elon Musk. Jennifer Jacobs reported earlier today, before Trump’s inauguration, that a source confirmed there had been friction between “rank and file” DOGE staff and Ramaswamy. A source familiar with the matter also told Jacobs that Ramaswamy had been subtly encouraged to exit as co-lead at DOGE. “It became increasingly clear over the last week that pursuing the governor’s race and running DOGE was not compatible. He’s leaving on good terms with Trump, Elon and the team.” -An anonymous source familiar with the matter spoke to NBC News. To date, DOGE has been secretive and has conducted most of its operations over Signal, the encrypted messaging app, and inside SpaceX’s Washington offices. A person familiar with the DOGE matter revealed that multiple executive orders related to its purview were expected in the first week of the Trump administration. He also said that the executive orders will include one that deals with government contracts and one that assigns how the DOGE workforce is embedded throughout the government. Trump also maintained that DOGE would not be a fully-fledged federal agency. The president said that despite the project’s name, it would only provide advice and guidance from outside the government. Politico first reported on January 19 that Ramaswamy could step down from DOGE before launching a bid for governor. The report also highlighted that a person familiar with the transition confirmed that Ramaswamy had informed members of the transition that he planned to run for governor. This morning, the biotech entrepreneur posted a photo of himself with Musk on X, captioned “A new dawn.” Ramaswamy seeks to run for governor of Ohio The politician challenged Trump for the Republican presidential nomination last year, but he became an ally and endorsed Trump after ending his bid in January. Ramaswamy revealed that he put his Ohio political ambitions on hold to help lead the DOGE project with Elon. Ramaswamy changed his plans on Friday after Gov. Mike DeWine appointed Lt. Gov. Jon Husted, another Republican eyeing the governorship, to the Senate seat. The biotech entrepreneur was eyeing the senate seat recently vacated by Vice President-elect JD Vance. Ramaswamy plans to vie for the governor seat with Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and state Treasurer Robert Sprague. Yost’s team revealed that Ohio AG had recruited Justin Clark, a veteran of Trump’s campaigns in his first administration, to be the general consultant for his soon-to-launch bid for governor. A Yost’s spokesperson and senior adviser also acknowledged that Justin was nationally recognized for winning some of the most hotly contested bids for governor. Yost also wrote on Friday night that as Ohio’s next governor, he will work with President Trump to advance his America First Agenda. Sprague also filed paperwork on Friday with the Ohio Secretary of State, which revealed his plans to seek governorship. Sprague posted that he would keep fighting to reform a broken system and “make Ohio the Midwest’s economic powerhouse.” He plans to seek the governorship. He posted that he will keep fighting to reform a broken system As Ramaswamy eyes for the governor seat, he has written two books exploring American politics, including “Woke, Inc.: Inside Corporate America’s Social Justice Scam” and “Nation of Victims: Identity Politics, the Death of Merit, and the Path Back to Excellence.” From Zero to Web3 Pro: Your 90-Day Career Launch Plan",News|DOGE,EN,0,0,DOGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-21 02:00:04

Stellar’s (XLM) price trajectory has also captivated market watchers, with a bullish weekly chart and critical Fibonacci levels signaling a promising long-term growth horizon in the crypto market. Amidst these developments, BlockDAG (BDAG) has brought on board ex-Cardano leader Marius Bock, whose profound blockchain innovation expertise is set to elevate its strategic ambitions. As the BlockDAG community braces for the eagerly awaited Mainnet launch under Bock’s stewardship, and with BDAG’s presale revenue skyrocketing past $182M, market spectators are buzzing about its potential ascent to $1 this year, positioning it as the contender for best crypto in 2025. 2024: A Landmark Year for TRON Network Revenue The year 2024 has marked a transformative period for TRON, showcasing significant growth in its ecosystem, particularly in transaction volumes and financial metrics. The TRON Network’s revenue soared by 119%, reaching an impressive $2.12 billion annually, driven by an expanding user base and broader global integration. The network’s total transfer volume has surged past $16 trillion, underscoring its robust capacity for extensive cross-border transactions. Enhancements in TRON Network’s financial stature were further supported by an increase in the USDT supply on the platform, which escalated from $48 billion to $62 billion. Moreover, the network’s decentralized exchange, SunSwap, was instrumental in the launch of 94,000 new meme coins, cementing its status as a powerhouse in blockchain economics and transactional prowess. Stellar’s Price Momentum Bolstered by Bullish Weekly Indicators The Stellar (XLM) price is gaining impressive momentum, as indicated by its weekly chart which portrays a bullish stance. While day-to-day price movements may seem volatile, a panoramic view through the longer timeframe illustrates a definitive cup-and-handle reversal pattern. Stabilizing around its 25% Fibonacci level at $0.375, XLM consistently demonstrates adherence to these technical benchmarks. Instead of focusing on short-lived forecasts, analysts are pointing towards the weekly chart where the support near $0.16 is deemed crucial for sustaining its bullish trajectory. From Presale to $1: BlockDAG’s Mainnet Launch Under Ex-Cardano Leader’s Vision The induction of Marius Bock, a seasoned leader formerly with Cardano, heralds a pivotal evolution for BlockDAG. Bock’s extensive background in fintech and blockchain, which includes significant roles at Visa’s Fundamo, IBM, and Cardano, infuses unparalleled expertise into BlockDAG’s leadership. His prior accomplishments at Cardano, particularly in infrastructure enhancement, highlight his prowess in pioneering innovative solutions. Under his guidance, BlockDAG is poised to confront blockchain scalability challenges robustly and carve a formidable niche in the sector. BlockDAG’s architecture, which integrates UTXO and EVM compatibility, already sets it apart as a distinctive entity within the blockchain arena. With Bock at the helm, the network is anticipated to achieve heightened levels of efficiency, facilitating swifter transactions and reduced fees. Bock’s leadership will also steer BlockDAG’s much-anticipated 2025 Mainnet launch, alongside a team composed of tech luminaries, PhD holders, and Harvard alumni. This landmark launch is expected to fully harness BlockDAG’s capabilities, drawing developers and enterprises keen to tap into its scalable solutions for DeFi and smart contracts. The BDAG coin has already achieved significant milestones during its crypto presale, amassing over $182 million and witnessing a value surge of 2380%—from an initial price of $0.001 to $0.0248 in batch 27. Analysts now forecast that BDAG could achieve the $1 mark in 2025, spurred by the transformative impact of its Mainnet launch and the anticipated wave of adoption. With the remaining presale batches dwindling and demand escalating, seizing BDAG at its present price offers a fleeting opportunity to buy in what could be the best crypto of 2025. Forecasting the Best Crypto of 2025 TRON’s soaring network revenue continues to underline its dominance, with extraordinary growth in transaction volume and ecosystem expansion witnessed in 2024. Conversely, Stellar’s price ascent is supported by a bullish long-term chart and its synchronization with pivotal Fibonacci levels. Yet, all eyes are on BlockDAG, where Marius Bock’s strategic leadership is setting the stage for a transformative era. His oversight is expected to amplify the impact of BlockDAG’s Mainnet launch, further solidifying its status as the potential best crypto of 2025 . With BDAG’s trajectory towards $1 looking increasingly feasible this year, the window to acquire BDAG at just $0.0248 per coin is quickly closing, making now a critical moment to act.

Insights on Dogecoin Whales & Filecoin Price Dynamics,https://thecoinrise.com/web3bay-the-decentralized-amazon-killer-takes-on-e-commerce-giants-insights-on-dogecoin-whales-filecoin-price-dynamics/,"The cryptocurrency space continues to evolve, with Dogecoin signaling potential growth and Filecoin gaining momentum from a recent exchange listing. However, it’s Web3Bay’s decentralized marketplace that’s stealing the spotlight. Positioned as an “Amazon killer,” Web3Bay is on a mission to transform global e-commerce by addressing long-standing inefficiencies and empowering users worldwide. With $830,000 raised in its fourth presale stage and over 220 million tokens sold at $0.004562625 each, Web3Bay offers a staggering 6,430% ROI to early adopters. Unlike Dogecoin’s meme-driven appeal or Filecoin’s niche focus on decentralized storage, Web3Bay delivers real-world utility through its borderless marketplace and low transaction fees. Can Dogecoin Repeat Its 2021 Bull Run? Dogecoin is seeing strong accumulation from large investors, with whales purchasing approximately 550 million DOGE tokens. This activity reflects growing confidence in the asset and signals a potential price surge. Analysts believe this could push Dogecoin closer to the $1 mark in the near future. The four-hour chart also shows a double-bottom pattern, a bullish indicator often linked to upcoming price increases. Together with the uptick in whale activity, this pattern suggests that Dogecoin could see significant upward movement soon. Market sentiment remains positive, with experts comparing the current scenario to Dogecoin’s bull run in 2021. If similar trends continue, the cryptocurrency could experience substantial growth in the coming months. Filecoin at $5.42: Strong Market Interest Despite Dip On January 18, 2025, Filecoin (FIL) was priced at $5.42, showing a slight 0.07% dip from its previous close. The intraday range spanned from $5.34 to $5.93. Recently, Filecoin’s price surged by 12% following its listing on Bithumb, a major South Korean crypto exchange. This listing doubled Filecoin’s trading volumes, highlighting the growing interest in decentralized storage solutions. Despite the minor pullback, analysts remain optimistic about Filecoin’s long-term prospects. Its consistent market performance and increasing adoption reinforce its position as a leading decentralized storage platform. Why Web3Bay Could Be the Biggest Threat to Traditional E-Commerce Web3Bay (3BAY) is set to challenge traditional e-commerce platforms with its decentralized approach. By eliminating high fees and limited payment methods, it empowers users to trade globally without restrictions. This innovative model positions Web3Bay as the next big thing in online retail, giving merchants and buyers equal opportunities to thrive. In its fourth presale stage, Web3Bay has already raised over $830,000 and sold more than 220 million tokens at $0.004562625 each. The platform’s final launch price of $0.1959 offers early investors a massive 6,430% ROI, making it one of the most lucrative opportunities in the crypto market today. Web3Bay introduces decentralized governance, allowing token holders to influence key decisions and shape the platform’s future. Its plans for NFT marketplaces and cross-chain compatibility further enhance its value, making it a comprehensive solution for global commerce. Small and medium-sized businesses can leverage Web3Bay’s borderless marketplace to connect with international audiences seamlessly. Its low transaction costs and secure infrastructure ensure fair and transparent trading, giving it a competitive edge over established giants like Amazon. By combining blockchain capabilities with practical e-commerce solutions, Web3Bay is positioned as a leader in reshaping how the world shops. Investors who act now have the chance to be part of this transformative movement while securing significant returns. A Quick Recap While Dogecoin rides the wave of whale-driven optimism and Filecoin gains traction in decentralized storage, neither matches Web3Bay’s broad impact. By introducing a decentralized marketplace with low fees and borderless transactions, Web3Bay is setting a new standard for global trade. With a projected launch price of $0.1959, Web3Bay offers unmatched ROI potential alongside real-world utility. Investors looking for scalability, innovation, and high returns will find Web3Bay to be the top choice.

XRP Whales Have Made A High Number Of Transactions To Binance Recently As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Qucktake post, the XRP Whale to Exchange Transactions metric has spiked for the cryptocurrency exchange Binance recently. Related Reading: Crypto Liquidations Cross $300 Million As Bitcoin Reclaims $102,000 The “Whale to Exchange Transactions” here is an on-chain metric that keeps track of the total number of transfers that are taking place from whale entities to wallets associated with a given centralized exchange. Whales refer to the largest of investors on the network, who can hold some degree of influence in the market thanks to their huge holdings. As such, this cohort can be worth keeping an eye on. One way to monitor their movements is through the Whale to Exchange Transactions. When the value of this metric is high, it means the whales are making a high number of moves to the platform. As one of the main reasons why investors use exchanges is for selling-related purposes, this kind of trend can be a sign that the large holders are looking to sell. On the other hand, the indicator being low can imply this group isn’t interested in trading away the cryptocurrency as it’s not making too many exchange-related transfers. Now, here is the chart shared by the quant that shows the trend in the 7-day simple moving average (SMA) of the XRP Whale to Exchange Transactions for Binance over the past couple of years: As is visible in the above graph, the 7-day SMA XRP Whale to Exchange Transactions for Binance registered an extremely large value just before the latest price rally beyond the $3.3 mark. Related Reading: XRP Surges Past $3.2 As Whale Activity Spikes 81% The timing would imply that these humongous investors may have been anticipating the run, so they made the transfers in order to appropriately reposition themselves. So far, XRP has managed to hold around its highs, meaning that the whales may not have yet pulled the trigger on their selling. It only remains to be seen, though, how long these investors would keep sitting on their profits, especially if the cryptocurrency continues its recent trend of sideways movement. XRP Price XRP has been one of the best performers among the top coins by market cap during the past week, with its price noting a surge of more than 38%. While the run started off strong, it has seen a cooldown in the last few days as the asset has seen overall flat consolidation.

Elon and Trump Bromance (ELONTRUB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONTRUB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon and Trump Bromance can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon and Trump Bromance could become the next viral memecoin. Elon and Trump Bromance launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon and Trump Bromance on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon and Trump Bromance by entering its contract address – 9ukUgm9iuVKXKkWVNnmtXgS5eMtxeiqbUThdJtLzaHXp – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONTRUB.

Pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton, known for his involvement in high-profile cryptocurrency cases, shared his views on the controversy surrounding the listing of TRUMP coin by prominent exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken. John Deaton Defends TRUMP Coin Exchange Listings Pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton has decided to address the criticism aimed at the exchanges for listing the TRUMP meme coin. Some people in the industry have criticized the inclusion of the token on exchanges such as Coinbase and Kraken based on ethical and legal considerations. However, Deaton further said that if he was still practicing as a lawyer, he would have recommended the token to be listed in these exchanges. John Deaton stated that the enforcement approach used by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could be a concern if a token linked to a former U.S. president was being traded. He said, “How could the SEC, in good faith, continue prosecuting Coinbase and Kraken for selling crypto tokens when they sell a crypto token issued by the President of the United States?” TRUMP Coin’s Market Volatility and Public Reaction Since the time that the TRUMP meme coin was launched on the market it has been quite volatile. Pump and dump schemes have also been noted, where the token was first traded up, but then faced competition from other meme coins including MELANIA. Crypto analyst, Ali Martinez noticed a falling wedge on the lower time frame chart of the coin, indicating that there might be a TRUMP Coin price bounce back from the current consolidation phase. The listing of TRUMP coin has also attracted controversy among the cryptocurrency community and in financial circles. Shark Tank investor Mark Cuban , who was less than impressed by the token, described it as “stupid and embarrassing” nonetheless, he conceded that it demonstrated a change in the US’s fintech stance towards allowing more innovation. Cuban also shared that he wants to establish his meme coin, and all the income generated from it will go to the U.S. Treasury to help pay off the national debt. John Deaton Calls for Transparency and Charitable Use of Profits Pro-XRP attorney John Deaton also gave unsolicited advice to Donald Trump and his advisors on the profits from the TRUMP coin. He proposed that any excess revenue should be spent on the American citizens who have been impacted by disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires. “This would prove the potential of blockchain technology as positive while putting America first and ensuring that President Trump’s administration leaves a mark,” Deaton said. He noted that such an initiative can help to demonstrate how the concept of cryptocurrency can be harnessed in the solving of social problems. John Deaton also added that Trump has become a billionaire on paper and therefore, has other options open to him after the presidency. He noted that redirecting the profits of the token could be a brilliant chance for the US president to use blockchain for the benefit of the society. Growing Scrutiny of Meme Coins in the Crypto Industry The listing of TRUMP coin comes at a time when meme coins are drawing both interest and skepticism in the crypto space. While the coin has achieved high trading volumes on platforms like Binance and Robinhood, its long-term viability remains uncertain. Critics argue that such tokens could harm the reputation of the cryptocurrency industry, while supporters see them as a way to expand innovation. Coinbase categorized the TRUMP coin as an “Experimental” asset, warning users about its volatility and risks. Kraken also faced backlash for its decision to list the token, though both exchanges have maintained that their platforms aim to provide access to diverse digital assets.

Crypto analysts speculate that if Ripple (XRP) continues its bullish streak, it could see a surge to $5. However, amidst this development, the market experts identified an under-the-radar AI altcoin, WallitIQ (WLTQ) , whose ongoing presale has grabbed the attention of whales in the crypto community. Let’s see why. XRP Price Eyes New ATH According to crypto market experts, Ripple (XRP) could be gearing to form a new all-time high as XRP price breaks past the $2.68 resistance wall. Ripple (XRP) also saw an increase that took its market cap to over $160 billion, making it the third-largest cryptocurrency in the market. Interestingly, Ripple (XRP) achieved this feat in just a few days, suggesting that the XRP price launched a massive bullish attack and traders shifted attention to the altcoin. Several crypto analysts have also pinned the bullish momentum surrounding the XRP price on the resignation of the US Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair Gary Gensler, which will take effect on January 20, 2025. Ripple (XRP), which has been at loggerheads with the US SEC under Gensler’s administration, believes it will see a favorable resolution from Gensler’s replacement, Paul Atkins, who is pro-crypto. Thus, crypto market experts speculate that the XRP price will surge to the $3.5 level in the coming weeks if Ripple (XRP) bulls can retain control over the bears. However, the XRP price is expected to see some consolidation and brief pullbacks before seeing a vertical explosion to $3.5 or even the $5 mark. Meanwhile, according to CoinGecko , the XRP price has surged to $2.81, just 17% below its all-time high of $3.40. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Attracts Whale In Its Ongoing presale As XRP price prepares to rise to a new all-time high, crypto market experts are also optimistic that WallitIQ (WLTQ) will see a parabolic surge in its ongoing presale. Crypto investors, including whales, have shifted investments into this presale to purchase the platform’s AI altcoin WLTQ, currently offered at $0.0420. However, crypto market experts are confident that the AI altcoin will soon explode in value to the $5 mark, giving all early investors tremendous profit on their purchase. Thus, millions in the crypto community hurry alongside the whales to bag this AI altcoin in large quantities before it skyrockets in value. Aside from the potential massive surge to the $5 mark, whales are attracted to the AI-powered crypto wallet on the WallitIQ (WLTQ) ecosystem. Unlike traditional wallets, the crypto wallet combines decentralization and machine learning algorithms to reshape the crypto wallet sector. The whales are no doubt impressed with the wallet’s sleek features, which include Scan and Pay QR, AI-powered predictive analytics , and a multilingual AI chatbot that provides 24/7 assistance when using the wallet. Recently, WallitIQ (WLTQ) announced the MVP launch of its crypto wallet management mobile app , which will allow users to test out the sleek features on the platform. However, since only token holders can take advantage of this opportunity, the whales, along with other investors, see yet another reason to bag the AI altcoin. WLTQ, the platform’s AI altcoin, powers the network and serves the purpose of utility and governance , allowing all users who hold the AI altcoin to participate in making decisions regarding updates and changes on the network. Furthermore, investors can gain added perks like access to premium features and exclusive content by holding the AI altcoin. Conclusion While the XRP price looks prime for a massive surge to a new all-time high, Ripple (XRP) is still at risk of major pullbacks if the bears manage to snatch control from the bulls. However, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has gripped whales with FOMO as they hurry to buy its AI altcoin in presale, positioning them for massive yield when the token surges above the $5 level. The whales are confident in shifting investments into WallitIQ (WLTQ), as top blockchain expert SolidProof has thoroughly audited the platform’s smart contract , and the AI altcoin completed a listing on Coinmarketcap. So there is no time to waste; buy WallitIQ (WLTQ) today!

BTFD Coin’s Presale Is the Wealth-Building Opportunity You Can’t Miss,https://thecoinrise.com/regret-skipping-neiro-btfd-coins-presale-is-the-wealth-building-opportunity-you-cant-miss/,"Meme coins have become more than just a trend—they’ve grown into a cultural and financial phenomenon. From Shiba Inu to Dogecoin, these tokens have proven that community-driven projects can generate both hype and real profits. But let’s face it: we’ve all experienced the pain of missing out on a hot ICO, watching as others made life-changing gains. Take Neiro, for instance. Inspired by the newly adopted Shiba Inu dog from the same family as the legendary Kabosu, Neiro has captured the hearts of meme coin enthusiasts. But if you missed its early days, don’t worry—there’s a new opportunity waiting for you with BTFD Coin , a project that combines exciting features, strong community backing, and jaw-dropping presale performance. BTFD Coin: The Bulls Squad and Referral Program Changing the Game Missed chances can sting, but BTFD Coin is here to turn things around. With a presale tally of over $5.3 million and a community of more than 8,700 holders, this token is making waves for all the right reasons. Now in Stage 13, with over 65 billion coins sold and the price at just $0.000142, this stage is 97% complete. Time’s ticking to join the ride before the price jumps to $0.0006 at the presale’s end. One standout feature of BTFD Coin is its Referral Program , a game-changer for anyone looking to maximize their investment. Here’s how it works: when you share your referral code and someone uses it to buy $50 or more in BTFD tokens, they’ll receive 10% extra tokens. Meanwhile, you’ll earn 10% of the raise amount if you make it to the leaderboard’s top 20. For example, referring $5,000 in purchases could net you $500 in additional tokens, all while building the Bulls Squad community. And let’s not forget the potential returns. Imagine investing $5,000 today. You’d secure 35.21 million tokens. At the presale end price of $0.0006, your holdings would balloon to $21,126. But analysts predict a moonshot to $0.006 post-listing, turning your investment into $211,260. Beyond the referral rewards, BTFD Coin offers an engaging Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, live since January 1, 2025. Coupled with its 90% APY staking rewards, BTFD isn’t just a meme coin—it’s an ecosystem designed to reward its holders. BTFD Coin’s impressive presale performance, lucrative Referral Program, and potential for massive ROI make it one of the top new meme coins to join for short term gains and long-term success. How to Buy BTFD Coins: Ready to get started? Set up your MetaMask or Trust Wallet, load it with BNB, ETH, or USDT, and head to the presale page . Claim your tokens and start stacking rewards today. Neiro: A Tribute to a Meme Icon Neiro is more than just a token; it’s a heartfelt homage to the newly adopted Shiba Inu dog from the same family as Kabosu, the face of the Doge meme. This Ethereum-based token is entirely owned and managed by its community, embodying the spirit of love and camaraderie. Launched with a mission to unite dog lovers and crypto enthusiasts, Neiro has quickly become a favorite among meme coin fans. Its grassroots approach and dedication to its community have fueled its success, proving that meme coins can be both fun and impactful. As Neiro continues to grow, it serves as a reminder of the power of community-driven projects. Its story resonates with both newcomers and seasoned investors, making it a compelling addition to the meme coin world. Neiro’s heartfelt mission, strong community backing, and ties to the legendary Doge family earn it a spot among the top new meme coins to join for short term growth and long-term potential. Conclusion: Don’t Miss Your Second Chance Missed opportunities don’t have to define your crypto journey. While Neiro’s early days might be behind us, BTFD Coin offers an incredible chance to join a thriving community with massive growth potential. With Stage 13 nearly sold out and a price set to jump, now’s the time to act on one of the top new meme coins to join for short term. Don’t wait on the sidelines while others run with the Bulls Squad. Join the BTFD Coin presale today, and turn this missed ICO into your biggest win yet.

ETH is consolidating above $3,120 and facing many hurdles. Ethereum failed to gain pace for a close above $3,450 and corrected gains. The price is trading below $3,300 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a short-term contracting triangle forming with resistance at $3,370 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it clears the $3,325 resistance level. Ethereum Price Stuck In A Range Ethereum price started a decent upward move above the $3,300 level but upsides were limited compared to Bitcoin . ETH failed to gain pace for a close above $3,450 and corrected gains. There was a move below the $3,320 and $3,300 support levels. A low was formed at $3,203 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor increase above the $3,240 level. The price tested the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $3,444 swing high to the $3,203 low. Ethereum price is now trading below $3,300 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $3,260 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,320 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $3,444 swing high to the $3,203 low. The main resistance is now forming near $3,350. There is also a short-term contracting triangle forming with resistance at $3,370 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. A clear move above the $3,370 resistance might send the price toward the $3,450 resistance. An upside break above the $3,450 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,500 resistance zone or even $3,550 in the near term. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,325 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,200 level. The first major support sits near the $3,150. A clear move below the $3,150 support might push the price toward the $3,120 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,050 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,000. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 zone.

Elon shared last year that the department’s goals include cutting three-quarters of federal jobs and eliminating entire agencies, going for at least $2 trillion annually. But Trump’s executive order has been met with immediate lawsuits and fierce criticism from watchdogs, unions, and public interest groups all together. Progress pic.twitter.com/iNAgAtPPCV — Department of Government Efficiency (@DOGE) January 21, 2025 Keep in mind that technically, D.O.G.E holds no official power to enforce its recommendations. “To restore competence and effectiveness to our federal government, my administration will establish the brand-new Department of Government Efficiency,” Trump declared during his speech after the swearing-in. D.O.G.E faces legal firestorm Among the first to file a lawsuit was National Security Counselors, a legal advocacy group. They claim the committee violates the Federal Advisory Committee Act of 1972, which requires advisory groups to operate transparently. The lawsuits also accuse D.O.G.E of having an unclear legal structure, with Public Citizen, another watchdog, demanding more details about how the group will actually function. The lawsuits named many defendants, including Elon himself and the White House’s Office of Management and Budget. They argue that the initiative’s lack of proper oversight could lead to chaos within federal operations. But history tells us that this isn’t the first time committees like D.O.G.E have been created. In 1982, President Ronald Reagan formed a similar group to streamline federal spending. Though that effort did end up producing a delayed report with recommendations that were largely ignored. Elon Musk speaking ahead of President Donald Trump: “It is thanks to you that the future of civilization is assured. We're going to have safe cities — finally — secure borders, sensible spending. Basic stuff. And we're going to take DOGE to Mars!” pic.twitter.com/jO7NRSzcAP — America (@america) January 20, 2025 Originally co-chaired by biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, D.O.G.E now has Elon as its sole leader. Hours after Trump signed the executive order, Vivek announced his departure on X, saying he wanted to pursue political ambitions in Ohio, specifically as the state’s governor. “Vivek Ramaswamy played a critical role in helping us create D.O.G.E,” said Anna Kelly, Trump’s spokesperson. She added, “He intends to run for elected office soon, which requires him to remain outside of D.O.G.E based on the structure we announced today.” Vivek, for his part, said in a post on Jan. 20 that: “It was my honor to help support the creation of DOGE. I’m confident that Elon & team will succeed in streamlining government. I’ll have more to say very soon about my future plans in Ohio. Most importantly, we’re all-in to help President Trump make America great again!” The Reuters report says that Elon’s initial focus for D.O.G.E will be on assessing which federal agencies are ripe for downsizing or elimination. Agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Department of Education are reportedly under review. A new dawn. 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/a3Vthjth69 — Vivek Ramaswamy (@VivekGRamaswamy) January 20, 2025 Tariff threats add to the drama Meanwhile, Trump has also ramped up his trade policies after taking office, issuing warnings to Canada and Mexico about potential tariffs. Speaking to reporters on Monday, the 45th and 47th president of the United States said his administration was considering 25% levies on goods from both nations, citing border control failures and fentanyl trafficking as key reasons. “We’re thinking in terms of 25% levies on Mexico and Canada because they’re allowing a vast number of people over the border,” Trump said. He added that the tariffs could take effect as early as February 1. The tariffs are part of the president’s plan to overhaul trade systems and protect American jobs. Analysts predict these measures could severely affect Canada’s economy, which trades over $500 billion annually with the U.S. Trump has also reiterated the idea of stricter tariffs on China, using TikTok as a leverage point. The president said he believes the tariffs could force TikTok’s parent company to sell its U.S. operations to an American firm. Trump’s return to the White House has electrified crypto markets.

Amid this landscape, the BNB and SUI coins are particularly noteworthy due to their dramatic price fluctuations and the broader implications for traders and investors. Meanwhile, Web3Bay is becoming the next 10x crypto, carving out a niche in the e-commerce sector by seamlessly blending traditional financial mechanisms with innovative blockchain technology, setting a new standard for online commerce. This integration represents a significant shift towards more decentralized and user-empowered shopping experiences. BNB Price Action: Navigating a Volatile Landscape The BNB token has recently encountered robust resistance levels, manifesting bearish trends that have influenced its market behavior significantly. Observers have noted a downturn, with the price dropping to $676.54, a 2.38% decrease, amid escalating selling pressures. This downturn is closely monitored as BNB approaches the critical support zone around $609.6. The negative funding rates on exchanges, indicating a bearish sentiment among traders, further compound the complexities of BNB’s future price movements. The mixed signals from the market suggest a cautious approach, as BNB might face further challenges unless it can effectively navigate these technical barriers. SUI Coin Trends: Potential Amidst Uncertainty Similarly, the SUI coin has been on a rollercoaster, displaying potential for substantial growth mixed with significant risks. Price predictions for SUI vary, with potential highs reaching up to $9.92, contingent on overcoming the resistance near $5.40. However, the volatile nature of the market and intense competition pose substantial challenges to its ascent. Additionally, looming regulatory changes could impact the adoption rates and overall valuation of SUI, prompting investors to maintain a vigilant stance on this emerging cryptocurrency. Revolutionizing Retail: Web3Bay’s Innovative Model Amidst the backdrop of fluctuating cryptocurrencies, Web3Bay is pioneering the fusion of Web2 and Web3 realms in e-commerce, becoming the next 10x crypto. This crypto is quickly becoming the market’s new sensation as shown in its rapid presale growth of over $830K within weeks. By melding conventional payment methods such as PayPal with cutting-edge blockchain payment options, Web3Bay offers a comprehensive and user-friendly shopping experience. This integration is not just about convenience but also about savings and investment growth; shoppers utilizing the 3BAY token enjoy a 5% discount on their purchases, enhancing the appeal of Web3 technologies in everyday commerce. The 3BAY token, central to the Web3Bay ecosystem, not only facilitates transactions but also serves as an investment vehicle with substantial growth potential. Currently, in its fourth presale stage, the token price is $0.004562, with projections pointing to a significant return on investment as the platform gains traction and the token appreciates in value. Looking Ahead: Web3Bay’s model exemplifies how Web3 can transform e-commerce, offering a secure, transparent, and efficient system that benefits both crypto-savvy users and those new to digital currencies. As the platform continues to grow, 3BAY tokens are voted as the next 10x crypto, further solidifying its position in the market. Meanwhile, the BNB and SUI coins continue to navigate the challenging waters of the crypto market.

Adding more credibility to this fact, a CryptoQuant analyst known as Gaah recently highlighted a notable trend: a large volume of Bitcoin—roughly 1 million BTC—has been withdrawn from crypto exchanges over the past three years. This trend reflects not only the increasing recognition of Bitcoin as a financial asset but also a notable shift in investor behavior. It also suggests a changing dynamic in how market participants view and use the asset in recent years. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reclaims Crucial Liquidity Level – No Resistance Left Below ATH What It Means For The BTC Market Gaah’s analysis points to a clear trend: approximately one million BTC have been withdrawn from exchanges over the past three years. This pattern reflects a growing preference among investors to hold Bitcoin off-exchange, a strategy that often signals long-term confidence in the asset’s value. Gaah wrote: This trend reflects both the growing global adoption of the asset as a store of value and a strategy against market volatility, using the asset itself as a margin in hedge operations. Gaah also highlighted that the trend first gained attention in November 2022, when significant outflows coincided with a period of market weakness. Investors appeared to be accumulating Bitcoin in anticipation of a notable recovery. 1 million Bitcoin withdrawn from exchanges in the last 3 years “The withdrawal of BTC from exchanges reduces liquidity and, consequently, selling pressure, which can support the price in short-term realizations.” – By @gaah_im Read more 👇https://t.co/sZHbF3r36m pic.twitter.com/DfFm4YtGWj — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) January 20, 2025 Now, two years later, a similar wave of withdrawals is occurring, but this time against the backdrop of Bitcoin trading near historic highs. Gaah noted: This contrast between accumulation during a bearish period and withdrawal after strong rises reveals the different market dynamics impacted by changes in behavior since the market matured. It is worth noting that by reducing liquidity on exchanges, these withdrawals can also decrease selling pressure, providing support for Bitcoin’s price during market corrections. However, the analyst mentioned: With fewer BTC available for trading, the market is preparing for new, more volatile price movements. Bitcoin Market Performance Meanwhile, BTC has so far been on a rollercoaster ride since the year began. After initially beginning the year with an increase, BTC was quick to face correction which left investors in despair. Related Reading: Why Bitcoin’s Ongoing Recovery Could Be Just the Beginning Of a Larger Rally However, as of today, the asset is now back in a bullish action. In the early hours of Monday, Bitcoin saw a notable surge renewing its all-time high after a breach above $109,000. This has caused the asset’s weekly performance to enter a double-digit gain. However, at the time of writing, there has been a slight retracement with BTC now trading at $104,782, marking a 0.1% decrease in the past day.

As of noon Hong Kong Time, BTC call options, which offer a bullish exposure in the leading cryptocurrency, traded pricier than ETH calls across time frames, according to risk reversals tracked by Amberdata. Risk reversal measures the difference between implied volatility for calls relative to puts, with positive values signaling a bullish sentiment. BTC's risk reversals show short-term and near-term calls trading at a four to five volatility points premium to puts. Meanwhile, ETH calls trade at a relatively lesser volatility premium to puts. In other words, the ether-bitcoin ratio is seen extending the downtrend. The ratio hit a three-year low of 0.03 early this week. The bias favoring BTC is particularly striking given that Trump did not mention the strategic bitcoin reserve on Monday, despite prior rumors suggesting he would. At the same time, a report showing GOP congressional priorities didn't include mentions of bitcoin or crypto. Traders on the decentralized betting platform Polymarket now see a 38% chance of Trump announcing a strategic BTC reserve in his first 100 days of presidency.

Lord Barron Trump (BARTRUMP), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because BARTRUMP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Lord Barron Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Lord Barron Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Lord Barron Trump launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Lord Barron Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Lord Barron Trump by entering its contract address – D1na43rvB8ANQYK5KNJuYNK9RrAPaz9zevLGzw8DyZae – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like BARTRUMP. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|DOGE|SOL|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-21 04:12:00

He signed an executive order allowing the popular video app to continue to run in the U.S. for 75 more days. According to Financial Times , hours after being sworn in on Monday, Trump pushed back a deadline requiring ByteDance, the Chinese parent company of TikTok, to divest its stake in the US or face being banned from the country. “If TikTok keeps operating past that deadline, the U.S. should get half of it,” Trump said. He also warned that he could impose tariffs on China if it refused a deal, calling such a rejection a “hostile act.” Trump awaits China’s agreement, or else he’d put 100% tariffs Trump wasn’t ruling out extreme measures and said tariffs could rise to 100%. But in the end, he says Beijing would agree or “we’d put tariffs on China,” he said as he signed the order in the Oval Office. “I’m not saying I would.” he said, “but you certainly could do that. ” The executive order states that the additional 75 days would give his administration additional time to determine TikTok’s future. That also reassures companies like Apple, Google, and cloud provider Oracle, which distribute or host TikTok, that they’re not going to bear the brunt of any punishment in the interim. Under current laws, these service providers could have been fined up to $5,000 per user. The Supreme Court upheld the ban, sending TikTok offline briefly at midnight Sunday. Yet hours later, service was back up after the company said Trump had given enough assurances that service providers wouldn’t be penalized. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew had been working behind the scenes to keep the app running, especially after Trump hinted during his campaign that he wanted to “save” it. Over the weekend, Chew even publicly praised Trump with tech giants Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg at Trump’s inauguration on Monday. Some U.S. lawmakers and security officials are worried that China’s government could use TikTok to spy on Americans or tweak the platform’s algorithm to manipulate TikTok users. Beijing has no influence over the app, as per TikTok claims. China, for its part, has made it clear it doesn’t want a forced sale. Moreover, ByteDance has said TikTok can’t be sold within the given timeframe anyway. TikTok would remain in the U.S, possibly under Elon Musk Despite the challenges, Trump insisted that if TikTok remains in the U.S. past the deadline, “half of its value” should go to the country. “If I don’t do the deal, it’s worthless. If I do it, maybe it’s worth a trillion dollars,” says Trump. Chinese officials are considering using Musk, who has close ties to Trump, as a broker for the app’s U.S. operations. Musk himself weighed in on Sunday, complaining about an imbalance. The video-making app is allowed in the U.S., but platform X is banned in China. “Something needs to change,” he said. Musk made an exception here. He rarely speaks out on issues sensitive to Beijing, as Tesla relies so much on China for both manufacturing and sales. Trump’s threat of tariffs over a TikTok deal has yet to receive an official response from China. But on Monday, its foreign ministry said that any decision about the app’s ownership should be based on “market principles” and left up to the companies involved.

Rising asset prices have elevated total assets under management (AuM) to an unprecedented $171 billion. ETP trading volumes across the globe also remained substantial at $21 billion, equating to 34% of trusted exchange bitcoin trading volumes. Trump Euphoria Inflows According to the latest edition of CoinShares’ Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report , Bitcoin recorded $1.9 billion in inflows last week. The latest figure pushed its year-to-date (YTD) inflows to $2.7 billion. Interestingly, despite the recent price increases, there were small outflows of $0.5 million from short positions, which contrasts with the typical inflows observed during periods of positive price momentum. Ethereum experienced inflows of $246 million, reversing its year-to-date outflows, though it remains the weakest performer in terms of flows this year. Still, these figures overshadow Solana’s modest $2.5 million in inflows. XRP added $31 million in inflows last week, bringing its total since mid-November 2024 to an extraordinary $484 million. Chainlink reported $2.8 million in inflows, followed by multi-asset products with $2.7 million and Stellar with $2.1 million. Meanwhile, Litecoin and Cardano each saw modest inflows of $0.5 million during the same period. The United States led the way with $2 billion in inflows over the past week, while Switzerland and Canada also saw significant activity, with $89 million and $13.4 million, respectively. Australia and Brazil contributed $5.3 million and $4.2 million in inflows, while Hong Kong recorded a modest $0.5 million. Sweden and Germany, on the other hand, experienced outflows of $14.5 million and $2.4 million respectively. Bitcoin Hits New Peak Ahead of Donald Trump’s inauguration as the 47th President of the United States, Bitcoin has surpassed $109,000, sparking expert forecasts of continued growth. According to CryptoQuant’s recent analysis , for instance, Bitcoin prices could reach $145,000 to $249,000 in 2025, driven by institutional capital flows, supportive US monetary policies, and historical cyclical trends. The incoming US administration’s pro-crypto stance, including crypto-friendly regulators and potential executive actions, is expected to boost demand. On top of that, projected interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve may further enhance the appeal of risk assets like Bitcoin. Historical patterns indicate that 2025, the final year of Bitcoin’s 4-year cycle, typically sees significant price gains. The on-chain analytic platform projects $520 billion in new capital inflows during this period, measured using realized capitalization. It is also important to note that institutional investors, including custodial services and ETFs holding 100 to 1,000 BTC, have already increased their holdings by $127 billion in 2024. Moreover, past cycles witnessed inflows surge from $86 billion in 2015-2018 to $440 billion by early 2025.

While Bitcoin (BTC) price maintained a hold above the $102K level, top meme coins such as Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Official Trump (TRUMP) have traded in the red territory. Notably, the global cryptocurrency market cap jumped nearly 1% over the past day to reach $3.52 trillion. Further, the global trading volume dropped 7.5% to $318.11 billion. Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) showcased a sideways trading session intraday. Besides, XRP hovered in the green territory. Here’s a brief overview of some of the top cryptocurrencies by market cap and their price action on January 21. Crypto Market Today: BTC Resilient Post-Trump’s Inauguration, Meme Coins Dip Despite the pro-crypto Republican U.S. president’s recent failure to mention crypto as a top priority, BTC has showcased potential by avoiding further dips. CoinGape reported that Trump’s Administration has failed to mention cryptocurrency as a top priority in a recent document sent to Republican lawmakers. This saga has raised severe uncertainties, contrary to the 47th president’s pro-crypto promises made last year. However, alongside BTC, ETH, XRP, and SOL have also showcased resiliency, avoiding major price dips. Besides, the meme crypto market has seen notable drops, with the TRUMP token leading the fall. So, let’s gauge in on the crypto prices today. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Today BTC price showcased a 1% increase in value at the time of reporting and is currently sitting at $102,725. The coin’s intraday low and high were $100,103.96 and $109,114.88, respectively. Notably, the intraday price chart shows a highly volatile movement, sparking contrary speculations as Trump takes office and the market eagerly awaits gains. Besides, a recent BTC price analysis by CoinGape reveals that expectations of new all-time highs are forming around the $120K and $130K levels amid broader developments. Ethereum (ETH) Price Today Further, ETH price slipped marginally by 0.3% over the past day and is currently trading at $3,257. Its intraday low and high were $3,202.49 and $3,444.28, respectively. Notably, a recent Ethereum price analysis by CoinGape revealed that the coin could suddenly skyrocket to $7,000. This bullish anticipation comes against the backdrop of rising whale accumulations and strong bullish technical patterns. XRP Price Today XRP price chart for today underscored a marginal 0.4% uptick at press time, reaching $3.11. The Ripple-backed crypto’s 24-hour low and high were $3.05 and $3.35, respectively. Intriguingly, renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez posted on X , revealing that XRP has broken out of a bullish flag. This hints at a $4.40 price target looming for the asset. Solana (SOL) Price Today SOL price slipped 1% over the past day and is currently sitting at $238. The coin’s intraday low and high were $232.40 and $272.15, respectively. Intriguingly, cryptocurrency expert “Ash Crypto” has recently posted on X , revealing that multiple users are unable to withdraw SOL from Coinbase amid the crypto’s rising popularity post-Trump’s inauguration. Meme Crypto Market Today Dogecoin price cracked 4% intraday and is currently trading at $0.3475. Notably, the meme coin’s slumping price action falls in line with the recent Elon Musk DOGE lawsuit that raised uncertainty among investors.

The price is attempting to break above its all-time high territory and while there was an attempt to do so a few days ago, it was not a sustained breakout. However, XRP is gaining attention, with upcoming developments like its ETF and potential IPO. The project is also expanding into memes and AI, and has formed partnerships with Cardano and Hedera. XRP is expected to continue to perform well and is expected to keep growing, making it an attractive option for investors. It is important to monitor the key $3 level for XRP. If the price dips below this level, it could indicate a shift in market sentiment. Micro structures are fragile and can change quickly, but the last support zone between $2.52 and $2.94 has shown strong reactions. After the triangle pattern completed, the price tested this support area, and the bullish outlook remains intact as long as XRP stays above $2.52. Long-Term Price Targets The outlook remains bullish , with key long-term targets on the chart at $4.19 and $5. These levels are achievable, and further price growth is possible. However, the exact movement will depend on the development of micro structures, which are to be monitored regularly on smaller time frames. Two Potential Scenarios Two primary scenarios are in play for XRP. The first is that the price is already in the fifth wave, the final leg of the current cycle, in line with Bitcoin’s movement. This fifth wave could extend, with targets between $6.61 and $9.81. These targets, though ambitious, are still within reason if the market continues upward.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|ALTCOIN|MARKET|ADA,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-21 04:59:29

The LBP sale is scheduled to start on Jan. 21, 2025, at 06:00 AM CET and will run until Jan. 23, 2025, at 05:59 AM CET. The ANLOG token will be available at a price determined by a transparent, community-driven discovery process, and all tokens that are bought during the sale will be fully unlocked at the Analog Token Generation Event (TGE). This will grant immediate access to contributors. (Source: Fjord Foundry ) Why Fjord Foundry? Analog decided to partner with Fjord Foundry because of its unique LBP infrastructure that guarantees fair pricing and equal access to participants. So far, this mechanism attracted a lot of traction as a trusted token sale model in the blockchain ecosystem due to the fact that it offers transparency in price determination and eliminates concerns about centralized allocation or unfair advantages. By taking advantage of Fjord Foundry’s infrastructure, the ANLOG sale will make it possible for contributors to influence the token's price based on their demand and valuation of Analog’s interoperable protocol. Fjord Foundry’s proven track record of hosting successful LBPs made the platform especially attractive to help with Analog’s mission of encouraging an open and equitable ecosystem. (Source: Fjord Foundry ) Additionally, Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools achieved widespread adoption as a preferred method for token sales because of their community-focused distribution processes. Unlike traditional sales, LBPs allow for guaranteed allocation and dynamic price setting, which creates a much more inclusive experience for everyone involved. ANLOG and Analog’s Timechain Solution The ANLOG token is at the core of Analog’s Timechain solution, which is a groundbreaking innovation that makes seamless cross-chain data and transaction flow a reality. Analog’s progress already attracted a growing community of developers and validators, and the LBP will be an new and exciting pathway for people to participate in Analog’s vision of a scalable, interconnected Web3. Overall, by integrating with Fjord Foundry’s LBP model, Analog wants to ensure that contributors dynamically decide ANLOG’s value while still supporting the project’s decentralized and interoperable ecosystem.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,TOKEN SALE|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|MINING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-21 05:00:28

The price could start another increase if it clears the $0.3650 and $0.3680 resistance levels. Dogecoin Price Dips To Support Dogecoin price started a fresh decline from the $0.4050 resistance zone, unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum . DOGE dipped below the $0.400 and $0.380 support levels. It even spiked below $0.350.

The next major resistance is near the $0.3750 level. A close above the $0.3750 resistance might send the price toward the $0.3860 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.40 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.420. Another Decline In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.3750 level, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.340 level. The next major support is near the $0.3380 level. The main support sits at $0.3250. If there is a downside break below the $0.3250 support, the price could decline further.

Queen Melania Trump (MELQUE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MELQUE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Queen Melania Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Queen Melania Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Queen Melania Trump launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Queen Melania Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Queen Melania Trump by entering its contract address – FLQiU6SnMoM6HKN5cQqk32Cx9CY7StiBZuVyXRQ4fxCa – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MELQUE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|DOGE|SOL|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-21 05:20:00

President Donald Trump has appointed Uyeda, a current SEC commissioner and Bitcoin supporter, as the acting chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) just hours after his inauguration. This appointment will last until Paul Atkins, Trump’s nominee for permanent SEC chairman, is confirmed by the Senate. Mark Uyeda has been a strong advocate for relaxing regulatory measures on the crypto industry. Alongside fellow commissioner Hester Pierce, he has criticized the SEC’s aggressive stance on crypto, including its controversial accounting rules. Uyeda’s appointment signals a potential shift in the SEC’s approach to digital assets. In addition, Trump has appointed Caroline Pham as the acting chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), replacing outgoing chair Rostin Behnam. While the SEC now has a Republican majority, the CFTC still has a split leadership between the two parties. This shake-up comes after the resignation of Gary Gensler, who stepped down from his position as SEC chairman on January 20th. Gensler had been a key figure in the crypto industry’s regulatory battles, facing criticism for his tough stance on digital assets. He had also been involved in blocking the establishment of spot crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs), although recent court rulings pushed the SEC to allow them. His departure opens the door for a new direction at the SEC, particularly in relation to the growing crypto market. Uyeda is expected to lead changes in cryptocurrency policy and reverse some of Gensler’s decisions.

Furthermore, the crypto community has also taken note that the President did not mention crypto when he swore in yesterday, leaving both the attendees and the crypto community confused.

While El Salvador added 12 Bitcoin to its reserves amidst record-high prices, the market as a whole saw significant liquidations totaling $1.28 billion, driven by sharp declines in major altcoins like Solana and Cardano. Bitcoin displayed relative stability, though its recent surge to a fresh all-time high has fueled discussions about its role as a strategic asset, including speculation over a potential US Bitcoin reserve. El Salvador Defies IMF Agreement, Bolsters Bitcoin Reserves Amid Historic Price Surge El Salvador, the first nation to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, continues its bold cryptocurrency strategy, purchasing 12 additional Bitcoin over the past two days, according to announcements from the country’s National Bitcoin Office. The acquisition comes shortly after the government struck a $1.4 billion deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which required scaling back some of its Bitcoin-related initiatives. On Jan. 19, the National Bitcoin Office revealed it had added 11 Bitcoin worth over $1 million to its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Another Bitcoin was purchased on Jan. 20 for $106,000. These acquisitions bring the nation’s total Bitcoin holdings to 6,044 BTC, valued at approximately $610 million at Bitcoin’s current trading price of $101,000, per data from CoinGecko. Notably, this purchase defies El Salvador’s agreement with the IMF, which had stipulated measures to limit certain Bitcoin policies, including unwinding government involvement in the Chivo wallet and making Bitcoin acceptance by private enterprises voluntary. The IMF deal, which provides critical financial support to the Central American nation, was seen as a pragmatic compromise to stabilize its economy. However, the latest acquisitions suggest that President Nayib Bukele remains committed to his vision of Bitcoin as a cornerstone of El Salvador’s financial future. El Salvador’s renewed Bitcoin buying spree coincides with a historic surge in Bitcoin prices. On Jan. 20, the cryptocurrency hit an all-time high of $109,000, surpassing its previous peak of $108,000 set in December 2024. This price rally, which saw Bitcoin briefly touch record levels, occurred just hours before Donald Trump’s inauguration as the 47th President of the United States. The sharp increase in Bitcoin’s value has significantly boosted El Salvador’s portfolio. As of Jan. 20, the nation’s Bitcoin holdings were up by $179 million, based on the Nayib Bukele portfolio tracker . This profit shows the speculative success of Bukele’s high-stakes gamble on cryptocurrency, even as critics point to the challenges faced by Salvadorans in adopting Bitcoin for everyday use. While Bitcoin’s price rally and El Salvador’s growing reserves paint a picture of financial optimism, public sentiment within the country tells a different story. A recent survey conducted in October 2024 revealed that 92% of Salvadorans do not use Bitcoin for transactions, up from 88% in a 2023 survey. Despite government efforts to promote Bitcoin adoption through initiatives like the Chivo wallet and the Bitcoin law passed in September 2021, the majority of Salvadorans remain skeptical of cryptocurrency as a practical payment method. The government has faced international scrutiny and domestic criticism for its aggressive Bitcoin policies, with many arguing that the funds could be better allocated toward pressing economic and social needs. Nonetheless, Bukele and his administration have remained steadfast, framing Bitcoin as a tool for financial independence and long-term economic growth. A Global Trend of Bitcoin Accumulation El Salvador’s Bitcoin strategy aligns with a growing trend among nations to accumulate the cryptocurrency as a strategic asset. Bhutan, for instance, has been quietly mining Bitcoin for years and reportedly holds approximately $780 million in digital assets, according to blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence. These moves reflect a broader recognition of Bitcoin’s potential as a hedge against inflation and geopolitical risks. El Salvador’s latest Bitcoin purchases signal that President Bukele remains undeterred by international pressure or public skepticism. The country’s $1.4 billion agreement with the IMF may temper the scale of its Bitcoin initiatives, but the administration’s actions suggest that cryptocurrency will remain central to its economic strategy. As Bitcoin’s price continues to break records, El Salvador stands as a case study for the integration of digital assets into national financial systems. Whether this gamble will yield sustainable economic benefits or exacerbate existing challenges remains a point of contention. For now, El Salvador’s bold experiment in cryptocurrency continues to capture global attention and spark debates about the future of money in the digital age. Cryptocurrency Market Faces Turbulent 24 Hours as Altcoins Plunge and Liquidations Soar The cryptocurrency market endured a volatile day yesterday, with significant declines across major altcoins and over $1.28 billion in liquidations. Traders were confronted with heightened market turbulence as Bitcoin displayed relative stability compared to other assets such as Solana and Cardano, which suffered substantial losses. According to Coinglass data , over 386,000 traders were liquidated, signaling a dramatic shift in sentiment. The total liquidations amounted to approximately $1.28 billion, with $816 million stemming from long positions and $307 million from shorts. This imbalance reflects the rapid price movements and adjustments in trader sentiment as market dynamics shifted away from recent bullish momentum. Bitcoin, which recently touched a record high of $109,000 on Sunday, experienced a modest decline of 2.2% to trade at $103,500. Despite the slight drop, Bitcoin’s performance remained relatively resilient compared to the broader market’s struggles. Major altcoins bore the brunt of the sell-off as risk aversion among traders increased, with many reallocating capital to stablecoins. Solana, a prominent Ethereum competitor, saw its price plunge by over 9%, while Cardano experienced a 5% decline. The broader altcoin market mirrored these losses, reflecting the heightened uncertainty and cautious sentiment among investors. Market analysts have warned of continued volatility in the days to come. Lukman Otunuga, Senior Market Analyst at FXTM, emphasized the impact of macroeconomic factors, stating, “Bitcoin’s sensitivity to US economic data and Fed rate expectations means traders should brace for heightened volatility in the near term.” Meanwhile, QCP Capital analysts noted a mix of optimism and caution. “While funding rates on derivatives platforms like Deribit remain elevated, suggesting underlying bullish sentiment, the market appears to be consolidating after its recent rally,” the firm observed. Speculation Over a US Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Adding to the market’s intrigue is speculation about a potential US Bitcoin Strategic Reserve (SBR). The concept has gained traction amid discussions about Bitcoin’s role as a strategic asset akin to gold. According to Polymarket , the probability of President Trump signing an executive order to establish an SBR within his first 100 days in office currently stands at 38%. If implemented, the SBR would involve the US government acquiring and holding Bitcoin as part of its national reserves. However, the policy faces significant hurdles, including regulatory alignment and collaboration with the Federal Reserve. Bitget CEO Gracy Chen highlighted the challenges of such a move, stating, “Establishing a Bitcoin strategic reserve within the first 100 days remains largely speculative. Implementing such a disruptive policy requires thorough planning, regulatory support, and alignment with the Federal Reserve’s framework.” As the market reacts to the recent turbulence, traders are closely watching Bitcoin’s ability to maintain its relative stability. Analysts suggest the cryptocurrency’s consolidation phase could provide a foundation for its next major move, though external factors such as macroeconomic data and regulatory developments will likely play a significant role in shaping its trajectory. The heightened volatility brings attention to the evolving nature of the cryptocurrency market, where rapid price swings and speculative narratives continue to drive both opportunities and risks. With Bitcoin’s role as a strategic asset under increasing discussion, the market’s next phase could have profound implications for the broader financial ecosystem.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-21 05:30:00

However, some analyst shared their bullish predictions as Bitcoin (BTC) hit its latest all-time high (ATH) of $109,000. Related Reading: $24 XRP Prediction: Bitcoin Maxi Calls It Risky But Possible Bitcoin Hits New ATH On Inauguration Day Last week, Bitcoin surged past the $100,000 barrier for the first time in over ten days amid the bullish expectations of January 20. The flagship crypto continued consolidating above this key level over the weekend, fueled by US President Donald Trump’s latest crypto moves. On Friday, the incoming US President surprised the crypto industry by launching his official TRUMP memecoin. The token saw a massive surge, hitting a $75 all-time high (ATH) and a market capitalization of $15 billion but facing significant backlash from the crypto community. As the token eclipsed the market, Bitcoin turned the key $102,000 resistance level as a support zone, propelling the price to a one-month high of $106,000. However, the market saw a 6% correction on Sunday afternoon after the then-incoming First Lady launched her memecoin, MELANIA. BTC dropped below the $100,000 mark before quickly recovering, closing the week near the recently reclaimed level. Ahead of Trump’s inauguration, Bitcoin’s price jumped 8.5% to its new all-time high of $109,588. Daan Crypto Trades noted BTC’s good start to the week after it “opened up with a small CME gap today but closed that straight away and went straight to new all-time highs,” adding that it will be an interesting week. Daan also signaled that today would likely be a “very volatile day in both directions” for the market but advised investors to “focus on what you expect for Q1 and not the next day.” BTC Price To Continue Soaring? Crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa suggested that BTC’s price could see short-term volatility depending on Trump’s comments during his Inauguration speech. “If a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is announced, I think BTC puts in a god candle, and everything sends,” he stated, adding that a lack of mention could start a momentary pullback. Despite the potential short-term shakeouts, some analysts highlighted that Bitcoin is entering a new price discovery phase. Rekt Capital stated, “History suggests this first Price Discovery Correction is now over.” According to the analyst, the December retrace was part of BTC’s “post-halving Parabolic Upside Phase.” Bitcoin enters a parabolic period that lasts around 300 days, each cycle after every Halving event, with the first price correction historically beginning between Weeks 6 and 8 of each parabolic phase. Related Reading: Solana Bulls Counter Bearish Pressure To Keep Price Above $240 After the recent price action, the analyst announced the second Price Discovery Uptrend lies ahead. He explained that “Bitcoin is now trying to breakout from its $101k-$106k range Daily Close above the $106k Range High resistance followed by a post-breakout retest would confirm the breakout and bring Bitcoin one step closer to additional Price Discovery.” Analyst Crypto Jelle highlighted BTC’s multi-year cup and handle pattern, which “looks like Bitcoin wants to get it over with.” The analyst suggested that the flagship crypto won’t “be waiting much longer,” adding that the long-term target remains $140,000. As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $104,564, a 1% drop in the daily timeframe.

In his first few hours of office, Trump has already signed other non-crypto executive orders, leaving the Bitcoin community waiting for any new pro-crypto directives. Trump signs multiple executive orders leaving out crypto Moments after being sworn in, Donald Trump signed multiple executive orders. As promised, he pardoned roughly 1500 convicted persons or those criminally charged in the January 6 Capitol attack and even started his immigration enforcement. Additionally, he repealed some of Biden’s presidential actions and dropped regulatory burdens on the oil and natural gas industry, which he argues will help to quell consumer inflation. Trump even paused Congress’ TikTok ban for another 75 days and withdrew the US from the Paris climate accords. However, Trump has yet to issue any pro-crypto policy directives. Trump and Melania launched their crypto tokens before the inauguration ceremony, which some investors interpreted as signals that Trump would support the crypto industry. They anticipated that he would cater to the industry’s needs and sign pro-crypto executive orders as he promised. The failure to give any directives so far, amid a slew of other orders, has crypto leads concerned. The top cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, even dropped by 1% to $101,300 as of 9:46 a.m. Tuesday in Singapore. At the time of writing, the price of Bitcoin had slightly picked up, trading at $102,196, representing a 0.30% dip in the last 24 hours. Other assets, including Ether and Solana, also tanked slightly. Ether is down to $3,243, a 1% loss in the last 24 hours. Trump’s official token is also trading down at only $32.75 , a 39.22% slump in 24 hours despite hitting past the $70 mark on Sunday. Trump and Melania’s tokens have evoked mixed reactions from the crypto community Trump was reportedly considering an executive order to make digital assets a “national priority.” Even before his inauguration, those close to him had hinted that industry leads should expect at least one crypto executive order for the first 100 days of his administration. During his campaign, Trump supported the establishment of a national Bitcoin reserve and even claimed he would make the US the crypto capital of the world, raising traders’ expectations. So far, the Trump and Melania tokens have drawn both criticism and support, with some seeing Trump and his family doing more harm to crypto’s reputation. Meme coins are still considered risky and joke-filled to many, so launching two meme tokens puts Trump in a light where he’s not taking digital assets seriously. However, some, like Ben El-Baz, managing director of HashKey Global, believe Trump’s family token releases emphasize his commitment to the crypto industry. Gautam Chhugani of Bernstein also expects that a meme coin based on Trump’s brand and politics could potentially last longer, arguing that these new tokens mark a “new crypto regulatory era.” From Zero to Web3 Pro: Your 90-Day Career Launch Plan",Bitcoin News & Insights|Bitcoin|BTC,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|ASIA|BUSINESS|COMMODITY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-21 05:39:18

These bull waves are happening thanks to Solana’s recent upgrades and whale backing, and it pushed investors to speculate whether we could see SOL at $900 any time soon. At the same time, projects like PlutoChain ($PLUTO) might provide a valuable solution to Bitcoin’s network constraints, with its own L2 technology that could improve scalability and expand its functionality. Now, let’s dive into this. Solana’s Rapid Growth: Speed, DeFi Adoption, and the Path to $900 As of January 19, 2025, Solana (SOL) is trading at $271.45 , reflecting a 15.16% increase from the previous close. The intraday high reached $262.80, while the low was $217.70. This surge positions SOL as a strong contender in the cryptocurrency market, driven by its high transaction speeds and expanding adoption in decentralized finance (DeFi). Notably, the approval of Ethereum ETFs has fueled speculation that a Solana ETF could be on the horizon, potentially creating a major surge in SOL’s price. Solana has recently broken above the 200-day moving average, indicating a bullish trend. Key support levels are identified at $235 and $222, with resistance levels at $280 and $302. A successful retest of the $280 level as new support could bring further profits. Rose Premium Signals posted on X that Solana has broken out of its consolidation phase and is experiencing strong bullish momentum. The price is now testing previous resistance, which has flipped to act as support, setting the stage for a potential rally. The first price target is $320.85, followed by $403.57, with Fibonacci levels confirming the bullish outlook. Solana’s robust performance and technical indicators suggest a positive outlook, with potential for continued growth in the cryptocurrency market. However, a $900 mark seems to be out of reach, at least for now. Could PlutoChain Revolutionize Bitcoin’s Blockchain with Smart Contracts and Expanded Features? PlutoChain ($PLUTO) is introducing a Layer-2 solution that could potentially elevate Bitcoin’s capabilities by adding support for smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Bitcoin has long been limited by its 10-minute block time, which makes it inefficient for handling more advanced applications. This has placed it at a disadvantage compared to faster blockchains like Ethereum and Solana, which have become the go-to options for complex applications. However, PlutoChain could significantly improve that by providing block time of just 2 seconds on its own L2 chain. This could allow developers to tap into Bitcoin’s strong, secure network while building dApps without compromising on speed. With PlutoChain’s testnet already processing over 43,200 transactions daily, the project is showing promising signs of scalability and readiness for a larger rollout. One standout feature of PlutoChain is its community governance model, which gives users the ability to influence protocol updates. This ensures that the network remains decentralized and stays true to the needs of its user base. Additionally, PlutoChain has passed audits by respected firms like SolidProof , QuillAudits , and Assure DeFi , further enhancing its reputation in the crypto community. Another exciting aspect of PlutoChain is its compatibility with Ethereum’s Virtual Machine (EVM) , potentially merging Bitcoin’s unparalleled security with Ethereum’s flexibility. This may open up a wide range of potential applications, including decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and even artificial intelligence (AI). Final Thoughts While Solana’s rapid growth and rising adoption position it for significant price gains, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) could present a unique opportunity to address Bitcoin’s network limitations. With its revolutionary Layer-2 solution, PlutoChain could enhance Bitcoin’s scalability and functionality, allowing it to support smart contracts and decentralized applications. As PlutoChain continues to develop and scale, it could unlock new possibilities, potentially making it a project to watch closely in the evolving blockchain landscape. The future looks promising for both networks, but PlutoChain’s technology could be a game-changer. ————- Remember, this article is not financial or trading advice.

He expects Trump to issue executive orders soon, allowing banks to trade and hold cryptocurrencies and offer crypto investments to wealthy clients. Trump, who has called himself a “crypto president,” is expected to push for fewer regulations and faster adoption of digital assets. SAB 121: A Barrier to Crypto Integration Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Allaire highlighted this potential shift, which could address longstanding barriers banks face in crypto adoption. A major challenge lies in the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121 , which prevents banks from keeping crypto on their books. Allaire criticized this rule, calling it “punitive,” as it hinders financial institutions from including cryptocurrencies in their portfolios. Although Congress once attempted to repeal SAB 121, President Joe Biden vetoed the effort, stating it was necessary to protect consumers. However, crypto advocates, including Allaire, see the regulation as a barrier to technological progress rather than a safeguard.

Solana Witnesses Increased Price Surge 2025 started on the bright side for Solana as SOL recorded a new all-time high of $294.33 on the 19th of January. Solana’s price increase is due to the positive sentiments surrounding the TRUMP and MELANIA meme coin, which have boosted trading activities lately. SOL trades at about $254.51, soaring over 45.25% within the past 7 days, indicating the token’s bullish movement. However, due to the launching of TRUMP and MELANIA on the Solana network, the influx of new investors has caused temporary congestion. This congestion has led to traders complaining of transaction failures during peak trading periods. That’s why SOL investors have turned to $RBLK for a smooth and profitable trading experience. XRP Reaches New All-Time High Ripple is facing another massive rally due to the high anticipation surrounding Donald Trump’s entrance into the White House. Following the hype surrounding the launch of the Official Trump meme coin, XRP surged to an all-time high of about $3.4, a record 40% surge this week. Additionally, the long-standing case between Ripple and the SEC has been called for dismissal by John Deaton in a post on X standing on the possibility of the Trump administration passing pro-crypto laws. XRP trades at about $3.16, surging over 28.1% within the last seven days due to the overall market surge. However, investors have switched sides, focusing on $RBLK’s potential for 100x gains post-launch.

From regulatory reforms to the launch of official Trump-branded tokens, his administration is making bold moves that are set to impact Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and beyond. Crypto influencer VirtualBacon highlighted these developments in his detailed X thread shedding light on what lies ahead for the market. Trump Went All In On Crypto, What Comes Next? Craziest weekend in crypto history? Trump's Official Trump Coin hit 100x in 1 day, and Bitcoin soared to an all-time high during his inauguration. Here’s how Trump’s pro-crypto policies could reshape the market — VirtualBacon (@VirtualBacon0x) January 20, 2025 The Trump Coin Frenzy Over the weekend with the launch of two Trump-backed tokens buzzed the entire crypto space: Trump Coin (TRUMP) and Melania Coin (MELANIA). Both coins, built on Solana, took the market by storm. Trump Coin reached an $8 billion market cap within a day, with a $42 billion fully diluted valuation (FDV), while Melania Coin hit a $1 billion market cap and $5 billion FDV. These coins have ignited a wave of retail adoption unseen since Dogecoin’s 2021 frenzy. However, U.S. regulations prevent further official Trump-branded tokens, making these two unique opportunities. In the meanwhile Trumps Solana, ETH and Memecoin craze can be a threat to XRP and Bitcoin in the near future. Pro-Crypto Policies on the Horizon Trump signed 80+ executive orders on his very first day however there are rumors that he will sign over 200 executive orders, many of which could favor the crypto sector. Key initiatives may include regulatory clarity for DeFi and ETFs, support for blockchain innovation, and even recognizing Bitcoin as a Strategic Reserve Asset. While large-scale Bitcoin purchases by the government seem unlikely due to budget constraints, leveraging the 200,000 BTC already held by the U.S. government could set a precedent for other nations. SEC Shake-Up Brings Optimism Moving on, the SEC’s leadership is undergoing a major transformation, with Paul Atkins replacing Gary Gensler. Expected changes include the withdrawal of Rule 3b-6, allowing U.S. users access to DeFi platforms like Uniswap, and the end of Operation Choke Point, which has hindered crypto companies’ banking relationships. These shifts, along with progress on the Fit for the 21st Century Act, could create a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment. Ethereum and Solana Shine Ethereum and Solana stand out as winners under Trump’s pro-crypto stance. VirtualBacon pointed to Ethereum’s strong ETF inflows, staking ecosystem, and seasonal performance. Solana, hosting the Trump and Melania Coins, is seeing record decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes. Macro Factors Fuel Bitcoin’s Bull Run Bitcoin is primed for a significant rally, with macroeconomic factors aligning in its favor. A potential Fed pivot to quantitative easing (QE) after the Jan. 29 and Mar. 18 FOMC meetings could inject liquidity into the market. Plus, a weaker U.S. dollar under Trump’s administration could further boost Bitcoin’s appeal. VirtualBacon advises holding Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana in the short term while monitoring tax reforms, ETF developments, and macroeconomic indicators for long-term strategies. With Trump’s pro-crypto stance reshaping the crypto market, the next bull market could be just beginning.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|SOL|ETH|ZRX,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-21 05:46:10

Transaction history suggests that Dogecoin and Cardano are gaining traction, with Rollblock (RBLK) quickly building momentum as its presale soars. Here’s why analysts are predicting huge 50x rallies in 2025. Rollblock (RBLK) Brings Innovation In Spades To GambleFi Niche Rollblock ( RBLK ) is a world apart from the usual casino platform, as it seeks to bring a new level of transparency to this 500 billion industry. Rollblock has seen a flurry of new gamers sign up for its blockchain-backed betting platform recently, recording a massive 600% surge in new registrations in December alone . Bets are fully verifiable on the Ethereum blockchain, meaning no bet fixing can occur. Rollblock recently launched its popular sports betting platform to enable bets on thousands of live international events including golf, soccer, and NBA. This, along with Rollblock’s 7000+ casino games, has seen a whopping $1.75 million in wagered bets last month, which could well double in January. Momentum is red hot, and the RBLK token is destined to ride high as a giant of the play-to-earn niche. It has a deflationary supply as each week up to 30% of Rollblock’s profits are used to purchase RBLK on exchanges before sending 60% to a burner address to reduce the supply. 40% end up back in the community through a generous staking rewards scheme. As demand for RBLK heats up this year, its price is likely to explode upward from its current presale price floor of $0.046. Dogecoin (DOGE) To A Dollar Looks Like A Lock Dogecoin has fallen by 5% today amid heightened market volatility. The Dogecoin token price hit $0.36 during Trump’s inauguration speech, as it emerged that Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is already facing a lawsuit for violating the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Musk will no doubt be on the offensive and Dogecoin is set to be thrust back into the spotlight once again in the coming days. Many Dogecoin holders are holding tight and waiting for the price to hit $1. This is now only a 3x away and Dogecoin could easily reach this target during the next season of meme mania. Cardano (ADA) Whales Take Profits After Rally Cardano has rallied enormously in recent weeks, gaining 14% in the last month of trading to hit $1.04. Cardano’s market cap has now reached 36 billion, as it has emerged that whales have been taking profits recently after the recent run-up. Realized profits of Cardano traders grew to a weekly high of $73 million on January 15, following Cardano’s rally to $1.15. Whale netflows on the Cardano chain have declined as the top 0.1% of Cardano holders have locked in some profits at these levels. This is bullish as it means that the coast is now clear for Cardano to continue its golden run towards all-time highs. Cardano could easily reach $3 in Q1 given recent momentum. Whales Continue To Flock To Rollblock Whales have been rotating away from large-cap projects such as Dogecoin and Cardano, to build a position in the hugely promising Rollblock (RBLK) startup. Investors have been using this knowledge to copy-trade and make an allocation while the Rollblock price remains so low at $0.046. Stage 9 tokens are more than 70% sold out already as a result and the price is likely to explode northwards this year. Discover the Exciting Opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) Presale Today!

Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who’s been closely associated with the Trump team has confirmed the decision on the same. “Ross will be freed too,” said Musk in a response to a post on a social media platform. Silk Road Founder Ross Ulbricht To Be Out of Prison Soon Silk Road’s Ross Ulbricht has yet to receive an official communication from Donald Trump for lifting his prison sentence. Back during his presidential campaign last year, Trump stated: “If you vote for me, on day one, I will commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht”. As Trump signed several executive orders at the Oval Office after the inauguration ceremony, everyone is waiting for Trump to pardon Ulbricht after 11 years in prison. Trump’s close associate and tech billionaire Elon Musk has confirmed the Silk Road founder’s release. Ross will be freed too — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 21, 2025 Angela McArdle, chair of the Libertarian National Committee (LNC), announced that Ross Ulbricht is likely to receive a presidential pardon within the next 24 to 48 hours. In a message on the X platform, McArdle wrote : “Pres. Trump’s staff just confirmed to me Ross’s pardon will be issued late tonight or tomorrow morning”. Elon Musk also confirmed the same in a recent X post response, which has further fueled market optimism. Notably, as per Ross Ulbricht’s post on X last May 2024, Trump will “commute” the sentence for the Silk Road founder. This means that the severity of the punishment or the prison term would be reduced. Thus, it will be interesting to see whether Trump takes a step further to pardon the sentence, meaning complete forgiveness. No Crypto Executive Order On Day 1? While the broader crypto industry had high hopes from President Donald Trump of having a crypto executive order on the first day, there’s no such development so far. There have been mixed reactions to this development. Anonymous crypto handle that goes by the name “Flood” noted: “NO ROSS PARDON, NO LEGALIZATION OF PERPETUAL SWAPS AND NO CRYPTO EXECUTIVE ORDER HAVE WE BEEN BAMBOOZLED BY THE TRUMP CRIME FAMILY?”. However, other experts have asked the industry to maintain patience for the same. Sharing his thoughts on the same, popular crypto analyst Miles Deutscher highlighted positive developments surrounding Ross Ulbricht’s pardon and said: “Tbh, it was unlikely Trump was going to mention crypto in his speech anyway. What matters is what happens over the coming days. There are already reports of pardoning Ross Ulbricht + and an executive order to allow banks to more easily hold digital assets. Patience”. TRUMP Meme Coin Tanks 40% Following the January 20 inauguration, the Official Trump (TRUMP) meme coin has collapsed 40% dropping to $32 as of press time. Similarly, the Official Melania Meme (MELANIA) is down by 60%, a day after its launch. The launch of meme coins by the Trump family has received severe criticism from several experts, including some from the crypto industry. Billionaire investor Mark Cuban has voiced criticism of the TRUMP meme coin, labeling it overly speculative. Cuban expressed concerns about the token’s potential to harm cryptocurrency credibility and exacerbate regulatory challenges for the broader market The post Silk Road’s Ross Ulbricht To Be Free, Confirms Elon Musk appeared first on CoinGape .",24/7 Cryptocurrency News|Donald Trump|Elon Musk News|ross ulbricht|Silk road,EN,0,0,MARKET|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinGape', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coingape,2025-01-21 06:01:45

It offers local companies the ability to use their AI chips for “inference” tasks. To “train” LLMs, major AI companies in China depend on GPUs developed by Nvidia. The company stands at 3.4 trillion and is seen as an essential part of improving AI technology. According to a Financial Times report , Huawei is promoting its new Ascend AI processors for Chinese groups that are considering “inference” as an option. Inference is the function that LLMs use to create prompt responses. The senior AI researcher of inference acceleration for Huawei’s Zurich lab, Georgios Zacharopoulos, says, “Training is important, but it only occurs a few times.” He said the company will serve more customers by focusing on inference. Huawei is seen as a strong competitor for Nvidia in China Nvidia’s prominent rival in the local market is using AI models trained on Nvidia’s products on the Ascend chips. According to employees and customers, Huawei’s direction has fewer technical challenges and can generate high profits. The company has also provided a tool to fill the gap between the different software used by Nvidia GPUs and Ascend. The Chinese government is also fully supporting Huawei’s promotions. Officials are asking local tech companies to use Huawei AI chips instead of Nvidia. One source associated with Nvidia’s operations in China said that the company is also seen internally as the country’s most serious rival since its chip design is more “advanced.” Unlike US tech giants OpenAI and Google, Chinese companies face the challenge of accessing the best-quality GPUs. Due to US limitations on exports, Nvidia only provides China with lower-quality H20 chips. Nonetheless, these chips remain in high demand in China, and they are still better than the ones manufactured locally.

Bitcoin Sheds 5% After Trump Inauguration After surging to a new record high of $108,786 on Monday morning, Bitcoin lost 5% of its value to trade at $103,279 as of press time. President Trump’s Official TRUMP also succumbed to selling pressure, plunging over 43% over the last 24 hours to change hands at $38.60. In his inauguration speech, Trump trumpeted his support for innovation, though he didn’t specifically make mention of crypto. “There’s no nation like our nation,” Trump declared. “Americans are explorers, builders, innovators, entrepreneurs, and pioneers. The spirit of the frontier is written into our hearts.” Many crypto observers had expected the new president to address crypto in some form, including discussing the establishment of the highly-awaited national Bitcoin strategic reserve. Others speculated that he might mention the $TRUMP and $MELANIA meme coins that launched over the weekend and sparked a speculative frenzy. However, he did not mention these newly launched meme coins either. Trump’s Plans For Bitcoin While the previous Biden administration lodged unrelenting attacks on the nascent crypto industry over the last four years, Trump has vowed to nurture the crypto industry, appoint pro-crypto regulators, and allow entrepreneurs to launch products without fear of lawsuits. Previously skeptical, Trump has repeatedly voiced support for Bitcoin as a strategic asset, outlining plans for the creation of a U.S. BTC reserve to boost economic stability. It was revealed last week that Trump is reportedly poised to issue executive orders that encompass abolishing the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s controversial accounting guidance. The new administration is also planning to issue an executive order to set digital assets as a “ national priority .” Overall, traders are hoping that a slew of Trump-issued crypto executive orders in the coming days will embolden the bulls and reverse the current bearish price movement.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|TRADING|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-21 06:10:35

Cardano also shows resilience and is holding its ground at the $1 price level despite experiencing a massive sell-off on Sunday. While these top altcoins recover analysts are making optimistic projections for Rollblock’s new GambleFi project, which has recently received a CoinMarketCap listing. Predictions about RBLK hitting the $2 mark after its official launch are already taking over the market, making investors jump ship to this DeFi utility altcoin before the limited presale tokens run out. Rollblock (RBLK) Could Jump to $2 After CoinMarketCap Listing Rollblock’s explosive GambleFi project is emerging as one of the top utility tokens of 2025 with its massive adoption rate. After the recent CoinMarketCap listing, Rollblock has gained thousands of new investors because of the optimistic community sentiment. As Rollblock continues to shine as a low-cap DeFi token, analysts expect to see the price reach as high as $2 once RBLK is released on the open market. Market experts are attributing Rollblock’s rapid growth to the revolutionary iGambling platform that offers on-chain gaming opportunities. Users can play 7,000+ casino games which include classics like roulette and slots and newer Web3-powered titles like Darts and Keno. Rollblock has also released an exclusive sports betting feature to expand the GambleFi ecosystem, allowing users to place bets on top international sports leagues using their cryptocurrency. All in-game payouts on Rollblock are made using the native RBLK token which powers the entire ecosystem. Token holders also receive exclusive benefits like cashback rewards, rakebacks, and a portion of Rollblock’s weekly revenue. Every week, Rollblock invests up to 30% of its casino returns into open market buybacks of RBLK. While 60% of these tokens are burned to put deflationary pressure on the price, the remaining 40% are distributed to current RBLK holders as staking rewards. This passive income opportunity is already attracting thousands of investors to Rollblock’s GambleFi project who can earn big through the platform’s provably fair gaming odds. Every bet is encrypted on Ethereum, making it impossible to alter or change bets once they are placed. RBLK tokens are currently selling for only $0.046, making Rollblock an attractive buying opportunity for savvy traders who want to diversify their portfolios with a low-cap DeFi altcoin. Analysts are already projecting up to 880% pre-launch returns for RBLK holders, making now the ideal time to invest before the price skyrockets to a new peak during the next presale stage. Solana (SOL) Generates $35 Million in Fees During TRUMP Frenzy President-elect Donald Trump’s official token was released on Solana’s blockchain on Saturday, resulting in a massive spike in Solana’s trading volume. Between Saturday and Sunday, Solana generated more than $35 million in fees. Despite being a low-cost blockchain, Solana generated at least $14 million in revenue over the weekend because of the TRUMP frenzy. Thanks to the high demand, Solana jumped to a new all-time high price level above $270. After a minor pullback of 6.6%, Solana is currently trading for $256.44. Despite the price correction, Solana is still trading above all of its Exponential Moving Averages on the SOL/USDT daily chart which confirms the ongoing upward momentum. If Solana buyers continue dominating the market, Solana could test a new high at the $275 level in the next few weeks. Cardano (ADA) Reclaims $1 Price Level After Massive Sell-Off on Sunday Cardano faced an unexpected 11.45% decline in value on Sunday, the largest single-day percentage loss since early January. The sudden dip was triggered by a sell-off as Cardano was previously facing significant resistance at the $1 level. Despite the pullback, Cardano has managed to prove its resilience by reclaiming the $1 position. Cardano is currently trading for $1.07 after an intraday decrease of 0.23%. Cardano’s trading volume is still up by 34.65% in the last 24 hours which suggests increased market participation. Cardano is also trading above all of its Exponential Moving Averages on the daily chart which confirms bullish dominance in the market. Since Cardano’s RSI suggests room for more growth, Cardano’s price could test the R2 resistance at $1.54 soon. Can RBLK Record a Bigger Rally Than SOL and ADA in Q1? Solana and Cardano are experiencing significant price fluctuations this week, making them risky investment opportunities. Meanwhile, Rollblock has gained the trust of thousands of early investors by delivering up to 360% return on investment. Given Rollblock’s recent CoinMarketCap listing, RBLK is likely to experience a bigger rally than both SOL and ADA during Q1 of 2025.

The president is also yet to commute Ross Ulbricht’s Silk Road prison sentence. The president did not mention repealing Biden’s EO 14067, which was the executive order on digital assets that enabled Chokepoint 2.0. Biden and a group of U.S. regulators initiated the Operation Choke Point 2.0 program to restrict the crypto industry’s access to the banking system. Trump fails to repeal Biden’s 14067 executive order Trump’s repeal of Biden EO’s did not include 14067 which was the executive order on digital assets that enabled Chokepoint 2.0 So career officials at regulatory offices still currently have broad over reach powers against entities dealing with crypto…. — Adam Cochran (adamscochran.eth) (@adamscochran) January 21, 2025 Donald Trump was inaugurated yesterday as the 47th president of the United States, and the world was waiting for him to deliver his promises on his first day in office. The crypto community was waiting for Trump to revoke Biden’s 14067 executive order as promised, but it did not happen. “As president, I will immediately shut down Operation Choke Point 2.0. They want to choke you out of business; we’re not going to let that happen.” ~ Donald Trump , U.S. President, at the 2024 Bitcoin conference. Executive order 14067 , titled “Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets,” was signed on March 9, 2022. Crypto businesses that had long been overshadowed by the executive order, as well as observers aware of its unfair targeting of the industry, were shocked that Trump did not mention it yesterday. Adam Cochran, a financial expert, posted that Trump’s repeal of Biden EO’s did not include 14067. Cochran believes that career officials at regulatory offices still had broad overreach powers against entities dealing with crypto. The finance guru expressed his distress after Trump repealed 78 EOs, but “couldn’t even get the digital assets one.” Cochran also said he was displeased that Trump had time to remove parts of the inflation reduction act, but none of the crypto day one promises. One user argued that Trump had just gotten into office and that his recent purchases on crypto still made him bullish. He also revealed that it might be bad for traders in the short term, especially those who banked on Trump to sign the order yesterday. Cochran stated that of all the day one crypto promises, the one that will hurt people the most is the “free Ross” one. Trump told attendees at the 2024 Libertarian National Convention in May last year that he would commute Ross Ulbricht’s sentence once he is in office. Choke Point 2.0 limits the crypto ecosystem Choke Point 2.0 was considered a successor to the original Operation Choke Point, launched under the Obama administration in 2013 and terminated by Trump in 2017. Both initiatives investigated banks and their relationships with certain high-risk industries to combat fraud and money laundering. Biden’s administration had denied the existence of Operation Choke Point 2.0, but critics argued that enforcement actions by several regulators had proven its existing operations. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Federal Deposit and Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) were believed to discourage banks from providing crypto services to crypto firms. The operation became clear after the federal regulators issued a joint statement in January 2023 warning banks about crypto asset risks. The decision was followed by the collapse of two major players in the crypto banking industry, Silvergate Bank and Signature Bank. Signature Bank also experienced a bank run following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). Regulators took over the bank even though it was still financially healthy at the time. One of Signature Bank’s board members argued that its downfall was a clear message from regulators saying they wanted to discourage banks from dealing with the crypto sector. Recently, several members from the crypto community have revealed that Operation Choke Point 2.0 was not just a theory. Paul Grewal, Coinbase Chief Legal Officer, disclosed in December that the company received “pause letters” through Freedom of Information Act requests. Grewal confirmed that the letters showed the FDC actively urged banks to halt or avoid crypto-related activities in 2022.

New Executive Orders Could Reshape Crypto appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Shortly after assuming the chair of the President of the United States of America, Republican leader Donald Trump, known for his pro-crypto stance, has cancelled several controversial actions taken by his predecessor, Joe Biden. Importantly, he has revoked the executive order aimed at creating a framework for AI regulation in the US, indirectly proclaiming his stance on the Web3, AI, Blockchain and Crypto sector. Meanwhile, experts like Eleanor Terrett, opine that Trump would take more aggressive actions necessary to support the futuristic sector. Let’s explore. Join! Trump’s Executive Orders: What’s Expected? Most exports, including Terrett, are confident that Trump would release an executive order announcing the creation of a cryptocurrency advisory council. Sources aware of the development suggest that the EO would create an ideal forum to bring together policymakers and business leaders. Establishing such a forum is necessary to develop feasible policies for the growth of the cryptocurrency sector, crypto enthusiasts think. CBDC Ban Speculation Terrett reveals that Trump may also issue an executive order banning the creation of a Central Bank Digital Currency. NEW: In addition to signing an executive order establishing a crypto council, #crypto policy leaders are also expecting Trump to sign an EO banning the creation of a CBDC. Unclear when exactly those EOs may be signed. https://t.co/MlpZD9AYcE — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) January 21, 2025 It was in March, 2022, that Joe Biden, the then-US president, signed the Executive Order on Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets, which discussed the possibility for the development of a United States central bank digital currency. Uncertainty Around the Timing Notably, the new administration has not yet announced any aggressive policies favouring the crypto sector, as against the general expectation that Trump would announce some pro-crypto policies within hours of his induction. Though highly optimistic about the probability for the release of some sensational EO supporting the cryptocurrency sector, Terrett admits that it is difficult to predict the exact timing of each pro-crypto EO release.

Nonetheless, an unexpected competitor has surfaced and experts refer to it as the “new XRP.” Remittix (RTX) , a low-cap altcoin, is reinventing cross-border payments and is positioned among the best crypto investment prospects available this year. Could Remittix surpass both Shiba Inu and Chainlink? Read on to find out the reasons behind investors’s close observation of this promising token. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Records a Rollercoaster Ride The Shiba Inu price showed its usual volatility as a memecoin during the past week, rising somewhat noticeably by 4% . Early in the week, traders were inspired by the Shiba Inu price chart showing a trend of higher highs and higher lows. A sharp bearish breakout, however, stopped this positive trend and brought the meme coin down to the $0.000020 level. Notwithstanding this loss, optimistic enthusiasm soon recovered and drove the Shiba Inu price above $0.000022 . This resiliency emphasizes why Shiba Inu (SHIB) stays among the promising altcoins to watch. Although the weekly trend indicated recovery, the preceding month was less fortunate with the Shiba Inu price chart showing a 6% drop. Still, community opinion of Shiba Inu (SHIB) is overwhelmingly positive since holders hope for a retest of its all-time high (ATH) of $0.000088 even though the token is now more than 75% below that top. Citing purchase signs from technical indicators like the MACD and Moving Averages, analysts also maintain an optimistic outlook for Shiba Inu (SHIB). Chainlink (LINK) Builds Bullish Momentum Rising by an amazing 38% , the Chainlink price has shown significant bullish momentum during the past week, confirming its status as among the top altcoins to keep an eye on. Strong market confidence was first inspired by the Chainlink price chart, which first showed a bullish structure of higher highs and higher lows. A sharp bearish breakout, however, sent the altcoin plunging to the $22.5 support zone momentarily. Short-lived, this dip was followed by upward momentum that drove the Chainlink price back into the $26.5 resistance zone. The altcoin’s resilience was clear even if it was rejected at this level; it gained support at $23.7 before rebounding once more to the $26.5 barrier, where it is struggling to break out from. When you zoom out, the monthly trend shows a similarly positive picture; the Chainlink price has increased by more than 9% during the past thirty days. Citing robust buy indications on the Chainlink price chart from important technical indicators such as the MACD, Momentum Oscillator, and Moving Averages, analysts anticipate further rallies. Remittix (RTX) Offers Seamless Cross-Border Payments Remittix is turning out as one of the best crypto investment options of the year as the need for perfect cross-border transactions keeps rising. Using cutting-edge technologies like the Remittix Pay API and Remittix Checkout, this creative platform effortlessly includes cryptocurrencies into worldwide payment systems.

Its attractiveness is improved by this thorough interoperability, which also helps to establish it as a leader in cross-border payment options. Driven by the growing demand for reliable and reasonably priced worldwide payment systems, analysts estimate an exponential increase for the RTX token this year. Hence, RTX is one of the best cryptos to invest in right now regardless of your level of experience with cryptocurrencies. Why Remittix Could Outshine Shiba Inu and Chainlink As Shiba Inu (SHIB) negotiates its memecoin instability and Chainlink (LINK) keeps gaining momentum, Remittix (RTX) presents a ground-floor opportunity that’s impossible to overlook with its creative ideas for flawless cross-border payments and a deflationary RTX token valued at just $0.0228 in presale.

This is a high-risk chart pattern that often leads to more downside. There are signs that the SHIB price has formed a head and shoulders chart pattern, another popular risky sign in the market. Shiba Inu is attempting to cross the key support at $0.00001960, where it has failed to drop below several times this year. The coin has also moved below the bottom of the trading range of Murrey Math Lines tool. Therefore, a drop below the key support at $0.00001958 will point to more downside, potentially to the next level at $0.000012, the ultimate support point. On the positive side, the coin has formed a small triple-bottom chart pattern at $0.000019, which may lead to a breakout if bulls defend that support. Dogecoin price forecast The DOGE price retreated this week after Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency was sued in the US. The plaintiffs argue that the appointment and the creation of the advisory board did not follow the law. The coin has continued to slowly form the bullish pennant chart pattern on the weekly chart. This pattern comprises a long vertical line in November last year, which was the flag pole. The pennant section of the pattern is formed by its ongoing consolidation. During most periods, this pattern is one of the most popular bullish chart patterns in the market. The bullish breakout usually happens when the two triangle lines are nearing their confluence levels. Therefore, the DOGE price is likely to have a strong bullish breakout. The next point to watch is its all-time high of $0.7600, which is about 122% above the current level. Pepe Coin price prediction The daily chart shows that the Pepe Coin price peaked at $0.00002837, giving it a market cap of over $10 billion. It has now dropped sharply and settled at a low of $0.0000135, which coincides with the 200-day moving average. Pepe Coin has formed a falling wedge chart pattern, which is made up of two descending and converging trendlines. The two lines are now nearing their convergence, meaning that a strong bullish breakout could happen soon. If this happens, the next point to watch will be at the all-time high of $0.00002837, which is about 90% above the current level. Dogelon Mars The Dogelon Mars price went parabolic, reaching a high of $0.000000685 on January 19 as most celebrity-themed tokens surged. It then dropped to a low of $0.0000002490 as the momentum ended. The token has crashed below the key support level at $0.00000030, its highest point in November and December last year. It remains above the 50-day moving average and the rising trendline that links the lowest swings since September. Therefore, the coin will likely remain under pressure as traders wait for the upcoming actions by the Donald Trump administration.

39248013,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=122813,1737443074,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,With Pi42 by RootstockCollective,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/with-pi42-by-rootstockcollective/,"In an exclusive interview with BitcoinWorld , we got the chance to speak with Sascha Goetz, Founder of the RootstockCollective What inspired the creation of RootstockCollective, and how does it align with the broader vision of Rootstock? RootstockCollective was established to unlock Bitcoin’s full potential beyond its role as a store of value. By addressing Bitcoin’s untapped liquidity, it ensures fair value capture for builders while rewarding the backers and stakers who support these projects within the Rootstock ecosystem. RootstockCollective’s mission aligns with the larger goal of expanding the Bitcoin ecosystem, fostering innovation, and encouraging more projects to build on Rootstock, thereby broadening the range of Bitcoin-based products available. Since the launch in September 2024, what has been the most surprising outcome or achievement for RootstockCollective? The initial community response to the RootstockCollective exceeded our expectations, with 4.5 million RIF staked in the DAO within 24 hours. More broadly, the RootstockCollective has successfully supported several builder projects in just over three months – a remarkable achievement in such a short timeframe. Take the Asami Club, for instance. This project focuses on social empowerment, offering cross-sponsoring and revenue opportunities via social media. Although their initial project didn’t work out with RootstockLabs, they secured grant funding through the DAO. Today, they actively engage with their community and champion the DAO’s potential, showcasing its value as ambassadors. Another notable project is Memora, a blockchain-based time capsule that integrates smart contracts for significant life events. In a somewhat macabre but practical example, users can set up contracts tied to their passing, enabling the transfer of crypto assets post-mortem. As a winner at the ETH Global Hackathon in Singapore, Memora utilized DAO grants to advance their project. These examples underline how RootstockCollective supports builders not just at the inception of their projects but also as they scale and grow, demonstrating the DAO’s ability to empower innovation within the Rootstock ecosystem. How does the RIF token governance system work in practice, and how do you ensure inclusivity and fairness for participants? Participation within the RootstockCollective is straightforward. One RIF token equals one vote, with a minimum of one token required to participate as a backer. Builders need at least 1,000 RIF to submit a proposal, ensuring serious applications and preventing spam. Transparency is a core principle of the Rootstock Collective, allowing anyone to track project progress within the DAO. A minimum of 4% community turnout is required for projects to receive funding, ensuring equitable participation. While liquidity differences among backers present challenges, solutions such as a delegate system are being explored to empower those with smaller contributions. The DAO remains committed to inclusivity and fairness, and we are doing all we can behind the scenes to ensure this remains the case. With $10 million in funding secured for the foundation’s treasury, what are your key priorities for allocation? The DAO’s $10 million first-year funding primarily supports builders through Builder Rewards and grants, while rewarding backers through Backer Rewards. Additional initiatives include funding hackathon participants and offering community incentives like airdrops and quest campaigns. On top the DAO treasury receives 19% of all Rootstock transaction fees soon, creating a sustainable funding cycle. Through this approach we aim to foster innovation while rewarding community involvement. What strategies are being used to engage and grow the Rootstock community further? Rootstock’s community comprises both builders and end-users. For builders, Rootstock’s unique status as the only Bitcoin Layer 2 offering Ethereum-like capabilities makes it highly appealing. The platform’s support for hackathons and workshops has attracted global interest, as demonstrated by events like the ETH Global hackathons, where we’ve experienced a huge increase in projects developing on Rootstock throughout the year. For end-users, often Bitcoin investors, there are some unique challenges to community growth. These users prioritize assurances about security audits and governance, seeking confidence that their assets are safe within the Rootstock ecosystem. Additionally, because they are less developer-focused, significant effort is directed toward raising awareness through social media and events. These initiatives are key to lowering Rootstock’s, and crypto’s barrier to entry, fostering inclusivity, and making the ecosystem accessible to newcomers. What initiatives or incentives do you offer to encourage participation and reward active members of the DAO? The CollectiveRewards program, launched in December 2024, addresses Bitcoin’s value capture problem. It works by asking the builders, who are seeking finance through the treasury, to designate a portion of their requested funds from the treasury to be given back to the backers. For example, if a project requests $5,000 in funding and allocates 50% to backers, $2,500 will be distributed among those who staked RIF voted for the project, proportionally split among voters. This approach encourages active engagement within the DAO, while ensuring all successful participants can profit – not just the builders. Looking ahead, we have exciting plans in the pipeline for further incentives, including introducing new roles for active DAO members, gamification elements, and NFT-based rewards. I don’t want to say too much right now however, just know that we are always thinking of ways to incentivize and grow the community within the DAO and plan to add more of these over this new year. As the first Bitcoin DAO to feature a Grants program, what challenges did you face in implementing it? Building the RootstockCollective involved extensive testing to ensure its mechanics were robust and effective. While balancing funding and participation equality remains a challenge, the DAO’s iterative development process allows us to address and refine based on community feedback. We’ve done this already, with the initial community feedback at launch leading to updates like the CollectiveRewards program. These improvements are all steps toward aligning the DAO with its long-term vision. We’re incredibly proud of how the DAO has evolved since launch. Already, we’ve hit double digits for positive proposals and grants handed out, and we’ve had a lot of requests from builders who want to submit proposals through the DAO. Depending on how voting goes for them, those numbers will only increase. As that happens, we’ll continue to improve and update the RootstockCollective ensuring it becomes even more effective and user-friendly. RootstockCollective staked $550,000 within the first 24 hours and has now reached $800,000. What drove this rapid adoption, and what’s next for encouraging further staking? Rootstock has been a trusted name for over seven years as the longest-standing Bitcoin Layer 2, which meant we already had quite a well-established community when we announced the DAO. This existing trust and enthusiasm played a significant role in giving RootstockCollective the strong start it enjoyed, with many users eager to dive in from the beginning. To ensure the RootstockCollective grows, we’ve been quite vocal in our messaging through social media and Telegram, getting across what the collective can offer to users who are active within the Rootstock community. Right now, the DAO is in its infancy but activity is high. Now, it’s essential we maintain this level of activity to ensure the long-term success of the project. What unique contributions do you see RootstockCollective making to the future of blockchain technology? The RootstockCollective is seeing many talented builders who are putting forth innovative project ideas for dApps. I’m sure as we keep going forward, many of these projects will become more disruptive to the usual order of things and may help advance blockchain technology as a whole. When that happens, the RootstockCollective will be there to support them. The most interesting area where the DAO may contribute to the future of blockchain technology is in the decentralization and governance process. Decentralization is a founding principle of Bitcoin and a core part of the blockchain. We are seeing many dApps appear on other chains that are taking a centralized approach, but with the RootstockCollective we are pushing for all projects to follow the decentralized bathway, growing the ecosystem and encouraging innovation. What were the most significant challenges in launching RootstockCollective, and how were they addressed? Projects like this take time and financial investment. At the start, it was a little difficult to completely visualize how we could put our theory into practice. We had to set-up the framework for the program: its structure, how it will look and the mechanics behind the scenes. Moreover,we needed that market validation from the community, which is hard to get until the project launches. We had to perform rigorous tests and market research to make sure all its features were things the community actually wanted. In many ways, our initial launch last September felt like a pilot. It wasn’t until we gathered feedback from the community – learning what worked as intended and what needed adjustment – that we could refine the DAO to better align with our vision. This milestone was reached with the launch of the CollectiveRewards programme in December, marking a significant step forward in the RootstockCollective’s evolution. What advice would you give to others building DAOs on Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions? Successful DAOs require a clear mission that is aligned with the Bitcoin community’s ethos. Transparency and community trust are crucial, as is ensuring the project genuinely embodies DAO principles. Sustaining a DAO demands long-term commitment, continuous updates, and active community engagement. RootstockCollective exemplifies how a DAO can thrive as a community-driven project, fostering innovation and collaboration within the Bitcoin ecosystem.

Will Bitcoin Soar or Suffer?,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/01/21/u-s-to-hit-debt-ceiling-on-tuesday-will-bitcoin-soar-or-suffer,"Some issues never truly go away, and the U.S. debt ceiling, which limits the maximum amount the government can borrow, is one of them. It's back in the spotlight, but past experience suggests it could be positive for bitcoin (BTC) and risk assets in general. The U.S. will hit its roughly $36 trillion debt limit on Tuesday, meaning it cannot borrow more from the public to fund its operations. ""The debt limit does not authorize new spending, but it creates a risk that the federal government might not be able to finance its existing legal obligations that Congresses and Presidents of both parties have made in the past,"" outgoing Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in an official announcement on Friday. The very thought of the world's largest economy unable to borrow more might scare investors, but note that a default and government shutdown won't happen immediately. Yellen has said that the Treasury will implement ""extraordinary measures"" from Tuesday, buying time at least till March 14. One potential measure could be running down the Treasury General Account (TGA), the government's operating account at the Fed used to collect taxes, customs duties, proceeds from the sale of securities, and public debt receipts while facilitating government payments. The previous debt ceiling episode of early 2023 , which involved using TGA to meet expenses, positively impacted risk assets, including bitcoin. That's because when the government spends the TGA balance, the cash goes to bank accounts of various entities, like contractors, employers and others, at commercial banks. That boosts the amount of reserves held by commercial banks. With more reserves, they have a better capacity to lend money, potentially increasing lending or investment in the broader economy and financial markets. As of Monday, the balance of the Treasury General Account was $677 billion. The chart illustrates Bitcoin's price alongside changes in the Treasury General Account (TGA) balance over the past five years. Notably, drawdowns in the TGA have frequently coincided with bitcoin bull runs, suggesting the inverse correlation between the two.",Markets|Bitcoin|Debt ceiling|Markets,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-21 07:12:05

The move sets the stage for a push toward $4.40, based on Fibonacci extension levels. XRP Price Eyes $4.40 According to the two‐hour Binance chart provided, XRP initially rallied from roughly $2.3374 on January 13 to a local high of $3.3509 by January 17, marking a swift rise that established the so‐called flagpole. After reaching this local high at $3.3509, the price shifted into a consolidation phase, moving within a downward‐sloping channel from January 17 through January 19 and briefly dipping below the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level at $3.1021 before rebounding. The breakout above the channel’s upper boundary, which transpired around $3.20 on January 20, is seen as a classic confirmation of a bull flag. A bull flag pattern comprises two key segments: the rapid, nearly vertical ascent (flagpole) and the subsequent, more gradual consolidation (flag). When an asset’s price closes decisively above the upper trendline of the flag, traders generally interpret it as a signal that the prior uptrend is likely to resume. Related Reading: XRP Whale Binance Deposits Skyrocket: Key Holders Preparing For Profit-Taking? In this specific setup, the distance of the flagpole is measured from the swing low at $2.3374 to the swing high at $3.3509, which yields a gain of about $1.01. Analysts then add that distance to the breakout level near $3.20 to approximate a price target in the $4.20 region. Martinez’s chart, however, also includes Fibonacci extensions that provide more granular potential targets, anchored at 0% ($2.3374) and 1 ($3.3509). These extensions appear at 1.272 ($3.6958), 1.414 ($3.8889), 1.618 ($4.1863), and 1.786 ($4.4475). The analyst cites $4.40 as the primary bullish objective, aligning closely with the 1.786 extension level. Related Reading: XRP Breaks Out Of Bullish Flag Pattern – $4 Target In Sight As per Martinez’s chart, XRP traded near $3.29, hovering just below the local high at $3.3509. If the cryptocurrency can hold above the breakout zone and ultimately surpass $3.3509, the chart’s technicals suggest a potential climb toward successive extension levels in the high $3 range and ultimately toward $4.40. The significance of the $4.40 target lies in its convergence of Fibonacci analysis with the classic bull flag projected move, giving traders a clear upside marker to watch for continued momentum. While short‐term fluctuations are always possible in volatile crypto markets, the breakout from the flag consolidation has offered a notably bullish signal, contingent on XRP’s ability to maintain support around $3.20 and build enough volume to breach the $3.3509 threshold. Notably, XRP couldn’t defend the breakout. At press time, XRP fell back into the channel and traded at $3.06. Thus, XRP bulls need to step up one more time to revalidate the scenario.

Within hours of its release, $TRUMP skyrocketed into the top 20 cryptos by market cap, peaking at an astonishing $72 per token with a market cap of $14 billion. Early buyers have already seen triple-digit gains, sparking widespread FOMO among crypto enthusiasts. Just two days later, Melania Trump added fuel to the fire by announcing her own $MELANIA token . The excitement around her coin caused a 40% dip in $TRUMP as traders scrambled to invest in the new token. Despite the price correction, $TRUMP remains strong at $57.8, boasting a $111.3 billion market cap, while $MELANIA trades at $10.89 with a market cap of $1.76 billion. This Trump family meme coin blitz comes as David Sacks, Trump’s crypto czar, declares a new age of U.S. crypto innovation. With the promise of a crypto-friendly administration and skyrocketing interest in meme tokens, traders are rushing to seize these early opportunities. As we are witnessing a rising interest in the overall meme coin space, other more established meme coins are bound to take the slice of the community interest pie in the long run.

However, as more tokens are staked, the APY will decrease, making early presale participation even more valuable. Final Opportunity to Join the Flockerz Presale With only 2 days remaining, the presale offers a final chance to secure $FLOCK tokens at early-stage prices before they debut on exchanges. Early adopters also gain the added benefit of staking rewards and exclusive access to Flocktopia, positioning them for significant returns. The successful presale performance has gauged the interest of crypto analysts such as ClayBro, a prominent YouTuber with over 135K subscribers. In his recent YouTube video , ClayBro shared his bullish outlook on $FLOCK. The YouTuber actually points out that the launch of the $TRUMP token may create a positive impact on the overall crypto space, with more investors willing to diversify their portfolios. The recent success of tokens like Pepe Unchained ($PEPU) and Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) is a sign of the demand shifting towards new projects. Flockerz Token Could See Massive Gains Because Of Trump’s New Crypto! He mentions that after $FLOCK officially launches on exchanges in under a week, the token could see exponential growth. However, it is important to note that new meme tokens attract high levels of volatility, making them very high-risk investments. Those interested in purchasing $FLOCK can do so through the Flockerz website, where tokens are compatible with $ETH, $USDT, and $BNB. Alternatively, tokens can be purchased directly through the Best Wallet app – available on both Google Play and the Apple App Store . Flockerz has built a robust community, boasting over 31,000 followers on X and 6,300 Telegram members, further solidifying its credibility. For those who missed the explosive launch of $TRUMP and $MELANIA, Flockerz presents an interesting option as it combines fun with real-world utility.",Uncategorized,EN,0,0,MARKET|BUSINESS|TRADING|BNB|ETH,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-21 07:15:44

This absence has seen crypto options signaling losses for the Ether-Bitcoin Ratio, while bitcoin price saw a slight price drop. Trump Speech Skips Crypto During his inauguration , Trump spoke about bringing the country together and solving economic and border issues. However, there was no mention of cryptocurrencies or blockchain technology. This disappointed many in the crypto world who were hoping for clearer policies or even support for digital currencies. Earlier rumors that Trump might announce a strategic bitcoin reserve or pro-crypto policies turned out to be untrue. Even the GOP’s public priorities do not include cryptocurrencies, leaving the digital space in a state of confusion. Before Trump’s speech, the crypto market responded positively to the expectation that he would mention crypto, which caused Bitcoin’s price to reach an all-time high of $109,000 . However, things took a quick turn when Trump didn’t bring up crypto or digital assets further. This led to a sharp decline in crypto prices. Bitcoin Stands Strong, While ETH Struggles Perhaps data from Amberdata shed more light on the situation. It showed that Bitcoin call options, which reflect bullish sentiment, were trading at much higher prices than Ethereum call options. This indicates that investors were placing more trust in Bitcoin’s future. Risk reversals, a measure of the difference between bullish and bearish options, also revealed that Bitcoin held a 4-5 point premium over Ethereum, highlighting stronger confidence in Bitcoin compared to Ethereum. Additionally, the Ether-Bitcoin ratio, which compares the two assets’ values, dropped to a three-year low of 0.03 this week. This further confirms that Bitcoin is currently dominating the market. What’s Next for Crypto? Trump’s lack of attention to cryptocurrencies has left many wondering about his administration’s plans. With no clear direction or policies, the crypto community is left waiting. For now, Bitcoin remains the top choice for investors, while Ethereum struggles to keep up.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|ETH|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-21 07:15:51

Official memecoins of U.S. President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania are down as much as 60% in the past 24 hours amid heavy profit-taking after Monday’s inauguration. Futures tracking the two tokens have fared similarly bad for traders — with liquidation losses at nearly $70 million for those betting on higher prices. These are not thinly-traded tokens where prices are easy to shift, either. Data shows TRUMP amassed over $19 billion in volumes over a 24-hour period, while MELANIA saw $4.5 billion exchange hands. Major tokens, such as Tron's TRX and Cardano’s ADA did under $4 billion in volumes in the same period, indicative of the high interest in the Trump family-themed tokens. Overall buying volumes are stalling in line with prices on trading application Moonshot, which was among the first to offer TRUMP to retail traders. A Dune dashboard created by @Seoulcalibur.eth shows volumes have dropped from an average above $6 million on Jan.18 to Jan.19, to just over $1 million in the past 24 hours. Crypto markets expected Trump to mention the asset class in his inaugural speech — such as plans of a promised strategic bitcoin reserve — but the lack of relevant words saw BTC fall from a Monday high above $109,000 to just over $101,000 in Asian morning hours Monday. Traders remain optimistic about a pro-crypto policy in the near term, however, with a focus on Solana’s SOL tokens. “Launching $TRUMP on SOL proves to be a significant endorsement of the chain, making it plausible that the SOL ETF could gain approval much earlier than expected,” Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a Tuesday broadcast. “With increased media exposure from similar launches, retail inflows will likely come streaming in.” “The launch of Trump's memecoin appeals not only to the retail memecoin moonshot masses, but also to major institutions as it solidifies the president's pro-crypto stance. Institutional investors are on the edge of their seats, awaiting concrete pro-crypto policies that could significantly influence the future of the economy,” the firm added.",Markets,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|SOL|ADA|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-21 07:19:15

This comes after the Donald Trump inauguration ceremony, an event that was expected to boost the confidence of crypto investors. Values of all major meme coins are down, especially Solana tokens including MELANIA. Crypto Whales Dump TRUMP Meme Coin A total of two transactions have surfaced, showing transactions of either sale or transfer of TRUMP tokens. They are collectively worth $74.22 million and have happened right after the US Presidential Inauguration, where Donald Trump took oath for the second time. The first transaction, as reported by Lookonchain through an X post , highlighted that a wallet named Ansem sold 194,799 TRUMP tokens worth approximately $6.83 million. Source: Lookonchain, X Ansem had spent 9.38 million USDC to buy these tokens at $48.14. The wallet has sold them at 35.04 thereby, losing around $2.55 million. Another transaction, as reported by Whale Alert, highlighted that an unknown wallet transferred 1,621,351 TRUMP meme coins worth almost $67,392,467 to another unknown wallet. This has sparked speculation that more sell-offs could be on the way as the value of the TRUMP token continues to plunge sharply. Source: Whale Alert Simultaneously, the speculation further soared as the TRUMP meme coin noted a decline of over 40% in the last 24 hours. Notably, the meme coin has been on the investors’ radar lately, with Coinbase announcing support for TRUMP under the experimental category. Solana Meme Coins Plunge All major Solana meme tokens have plunged in the last 24 hours. This includes the likes of BONK and WIF, with both down by 1.7% and 5.4%, listed at $0.00002911 and $1.37, respectively. MELANIA is also down by 62.7%, exchanging hands at $4.13, followed by MEW which has lost 7.1% of its value during the same time window. A decline in values across the Solana meme coin segment comes amid reports that Cuba may have sparked a pump-and-dump scheme . Investor scrutiny began when Cuba rug-pulled $158 million in 24 hours, during which it also recorded a market cap of $30 million. Nevertheless, Coingecko is showing signals to buy the dips in BONK and WIF, with investors expected to adopt the same approach for TRUMP meme coins as well. Sentiments Across Meme Coin Segment All the major meme coins are down despite TRUMP gaining over 440% since its launch. CoinMarketCap shows that the value of DOGE, the leading meme coin in terms of market cap, has lost 6.62% over the past day and is now listed at $0.3409. Notably, the decline in DOGE price is accompanied by a fall of around 9% in SHIB price. The inauguration ceremony of Donald Trump as the 47th US President has concluded, and he has expressed his resolve to sign major executive orders including the one related to cryptocurrencies. It now remains to be seen how long the ongoing sentiments last for the TRUMP meme coin and others on the list.

Despite the letdown, BTC closed the day on a positive note on Monday with a near-1% gain. However, Bitcoin price today is down No data found for bitcoin on 37 minutes ago%, while investors wonder if this descent could trigger another crash that pushes BTC under $100K. Will Bitcoin Crash Under $100K Again? Yes, Bitcoin price could crash under $100K if Donald Trump, the 47th president of the United States, or his administration does not make any crypto-related announcements. At least, this is the sentiment of the crypt markets. When Trump ended the ceremony without any crypto-related announcements, the recently launched meme coin TRUMP dropped 40% in the next eight hours. Bitcoin also dropped nearly 7% in roughly 8 hours, causing a broader crypto market correction. Key Crypto Announcements to Expect From US President Donald Trump Here are two key announcements that crypto markets can expect today, on January 21. The highly anticipated pardon of Silk Road’s Ross Ulbricht . Setting up a strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Instead of these announcements, the crypto market received notifications of crypto purchases made by Trump’s World Liberty Financial. The company acquired the following crypto tokens: $47 million worth of Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) $47 million of Ethereum $4.7 million worth of Aave (AAVE) $4.7 million worth of TRON (TRX) $4.7 million worth of Chainlink (LINK) MicroStrategy Might Steal Headlines With its Bitcoin Purchase Plan Regardless of what happens, investors need to note that long-term investors are waiting for Bitcoin to drop under $100K to buy BTC at a discount. Saylor’s MicroStrategy could make headlines again as it plans to increase authorized shares to support its Bitcoin purchasing strategy. The key focus of this vote will include the approval of increasing authorized Class A common stock to facilitate the purchase of BTC. MicroStrategy plans to increase the Class A common stock from 330 million to 10.3 billion and to increase authorized preferred shares from 5 million to 1 billion. Moreover, MicroStartegy’s Michael Saylor posted the portfolio tracker graph again, hinting at another purchase. Typically, these charts precede MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin purchase announcements.

As a result, BTC price today trades at No data found for bitcoin on 37 minutes ago after dropping No data found for bitcoin on 37 minutes ago% in the past 24 hours. Despite this minor retracement, BTC is up 0.53% this week and is still above the $100K psychological support level. *bitcoin price updated as of No data found for bitcoin on 37 minutes ago Bitcoin Technical Analysis The four-hour chart shows Bitcoin prize is bouncing off the value area high of $100,614. Roughly 68% of the volume was traded between the $93,181 and $100,614 range in the past two months. As long as this level holds above the upper limit of this range, investors can expect the bullish outlook to continue. Additionally, the market structure is also bullish on the mid-t0-higher time frame, indicating that the trend still favors buyers. Hence, a bounce off the $100K support level should catalyze a price rally to the current ATH of $109,237. Beyond this, if the buying pressure remains strong, the next key level to book profit include the 161.8% Fibonacci extension at $12,362. BTC/USDT 4-hour chart All in all, the outlook for BTC remains massively bullish, with Bitcoin price prediction forecasting a new ATH if the $100K support level holds. Any dips below $100K will likely be short-lived and could trigger a massive buying spree, pushing the crypto above this critical level. With the first pro-crypto president, the crypto market will likely kickstart a long bull run where Bitcoin and altcoin reach new highs.

Crypto venture capitalist Will Clemente commented , “What’s more likely is that they haven’t prioritized infrastructure build-out for Solana, maybe in part because they’re not incentivized to do so with a competing on-chain platform (Base).” Others shared screenshots of waiting times of hours for pending transactions, with one user asking, “Where are my coins?” before claiming to be down nearly $1,000, “patiently waiting for my Solana,” adding, “Literally never using your platform again. Moving to Gemini.” On Jan. 21, Coinbase announced support for the recently launched Official Trump ( TRUMP ) meme coin on the Solana network as a SPL token. Coinbase will add support for Official Trump (TRUMP) on the Solana network (SPL token). Do not send this asset over other networks or your funds may be lost. Transfers for this asset are available on @Coinbase & @CoinbaseExch in the regions where trading is supported. — Coinbase Assets ️ (@CoinbaseAssets) January 20, 2025 It is not the first time Coinbase has failed under heavy demand, and the exchange is known for going offline or having ‘technical issues’ when markets are at peak volatility. The Solana network has also had more than its fair share of outages over the past few years. SOL Price Slumps The rush to remove Solana and cash out has been exacerbated by the token tanking by around 13% over the past few hours. SOL prices hit an intraday high of $272 on Monday but dumped to $234 during the Tuesday morning Asian trading session. Additionally, the asset is also down almost 20% from its all-time high of $293 on Jan. 19. Solana-based and other meme coins are also getting mauled today. TRUMP has tanked more than 20%, while MELANIA has slumped around 50% over the past 24 hours. Other memes, such as Fartcoin, Dogwifhat, Mog Coin, and Freysa AI, are also deep in the red.

What could this mean for the crypto market? On Jan 19, the number of global weekly searches for “How to buy crypto” on Google have hit the 100 mark, leaping four times compared to last week’s number and is projected to go even higher as the week unfolds. The next day, Donald Trump was officially sworn in as President of the United States of America. His presidential term is poised to be much more crypto-friendly compared to the previous Biden administration. Many leaders of leading crypto firms have voiced their confidence in Trump’s administration and its potential to usher in an era of regulations that will benefit the crypto market. The number of “How to buy crypto” searches surpassed the search engine’s previously recorded all-time high, which was 38 during the week of Dec. 1 until Dec. 7, 2024.

A boost in “How to buy crypto” searches on a global scale could indicate that more people, specifically first-time buyers, are interested in delving into the crypto market. These people may have never purchased crypto before and could be interested now due to recent events, such as Trump’s pro-crypto presidency or the price of Bitcoin spiking. At this point, the two events have been inexplicably intertwined, as the previous Bitcoin rally that sparked its $100,000 surge was also prompted by Donald Trump’s win in the U.S. presidential election. Aside from America, countries like the United Arab Emirates, Singapore, Hong Kong, Thailand and more have expressed outward interest in expanding themselves into digital asset hubs so that they can keep up with the rapid growth of the crypto industry worldwide.

During his presidential campaign last year in May, Trump made a similar promise to the industry and now is the time to walk the talk. Besides, demand for Trump to sign an executive order for a strategic Bitcoin reserve is growing. Donald Trump to Sign Executive Order Banning US CBDC Digital Dollar? Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terret has reported that President Donald Trump is anticipated to sign two significant executive orders related to cryptocurrency. One order is expected to establish a dedicated crypto council, while the other would ban the creation of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). As per reports, the Crypto Council will be meeting this Thursday where the crypto industry can expect some big decisions coming. Terret mentioned that details regarding the executive orders remain unclear, however, the potential actions have sparked widespread interest and speculation within the crypto community. In his support for Bitcoin last year, Donald Trump also stated that he would never allow the creation of a US CBDC. On the other hand, there’s been a strong push for building a strategic Bitcoin reserve. On several occasions, the President has said that Bitcoin as a reserve asset will help to reduce the humongous $36 trillion US National Debt as of date. What to Expect in the Trump Era? While many from the crypto industry expected Donald Trump to issue crypto executive orders on Day 1, this hasn’t materialized so far. The industry is curious to know whether Trump would keep his promises for the crypto industry and walk the talk. Here are a few market expectations in the first 100 days at the office. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Instead of US CBDC Having a strategic Bitcoin reserve has been among the top priority for the industry with Donald Trump himself praising the asset class. Top industry leaders like Michael Saylors and crypto exchange Coinbase have extended support for the same. Now, the industry is waiting for an executive order for the same, with Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis being an ardent proponent of it. Other leaders have also opposed the idea of having a US CBDC or a USA coin for that sake. Don’t get distracted by shiny objects. Strategic. Bitcoin. Reserve. Washington is a swampy place. Decentralize the savings. #BitcoinAct pic.twitter.com/M3sMhRxewT — Cynthia Lummis (@CynthiaMLummis) January 20, 2025 White House Crypto Council The Trump administration is likely to establish a presidential crypto council comprising approximately 20 key figures from the cryptocurrency industry. The council, expected to include prominent CEOs and founders, will provide policy guidance. Besides, it will advise on digital asset issues, and help shape the administration’s approach to crypto regulation during Trump’s era. For a crypto-friendly regulatory environment, Trump has already appointed David Sacks as the White House’s crypto czar. Reports also suggest that Trump will allow US Banks to offer crypto trading services along with the SEC leadership repealing the controversial Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121) rule. Pardon Silk Road Founder Ross Ulbricht During the Presidential campaign last year in May, Donald Trump stated that he would commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht, the founder of Silk Road, on his first day in office. Although there’s no word from the Trump team regarding this, insiders say that Trump will pardon Ulbricht’s sentence within the first 24-48 hours.

A Polymarket contract asking who Trump will pardon in his first 100 days in office shot up to 99% after posts on X from Elon Musk, and Angela McArdle, chair of the Libertarian National Committee, said that a pardon for Ulbricht was in the works. Trump first promised to pardon Ulbricht during a campaign stop at the Libertarian National Convention last May. “If you vote for me, on Day 1, I will commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht to a sentence of time served,” Trump said during a speech last year. “He’s already served 11 years, we’re gonna get him home.” Ulbricht was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole in 2015 for his role in the operation of the Silk Road marketplace, which pioneered the use of the dark web. Supporters of Ulbricht say that his sentence was disproportionately long for the crime. Elsewhere on the Polymarket pardon list is Roger Ver, an early bitcoin investor and bitcoin cash (BCH) advocate, who was indicted for tax fraud last April , and the market is giving a 32% chance of a pardon taking place in the first 100 days. Despite crypto playing a prominent part of Trump's campaign, Polymarket bettors are only giving a 43% of a crypto executive order , regarding the use, trading, or legal status of digital assets, happening in the first week.",Policy,EN,0,0,BCH|REGULATION|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-21 07:43:52

Did Bitcoin (BTC) Reserve Plans Fail? Arthur Hayes Reveals the Truth!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/trump-disappointed-did-bitcoin-btc-reserve-plans-fail-arthur-hayes-reveals-the-truth/,"The day that has been awaited since November came yesterday and Donald Trump was sworn in and officially took office as President of the United States. While the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency world was closely following Trump's inauguration ceremony, Trump did not mention BTC and crypto at all in his first speech. This situation brought a decline to the market and question marks began to arise about the Bitcoin reserve. At this point, Arthur Hayes, who draws attention with his analysis, said that he is skeptical that Trump will create a Bitcoin reserve. Former BitMEX CEO and Maelstrom CIO Arthur Hayes predicted that President Donald Trump would not prioritize creating a Bitcoin reserve, citing other pressing financial priorities such as healthcare and defense. Hayes said Trump would put the Bitcoin reserve on the back burner due to the limited time frame before the midterm elections and competing budget demands. Hayes also noted that Trump has plenty of other things to devote his time and money to, saying: “I don't think Trump is going to try to create a Bitcoin reserve right now. Are you going to borrow money to buy Bitcoin? Or are you going to borrow money to provide healthcare for the elderly who voted you in? Or are you going to build more bombs to make the defense lobby love you? “There are many different things you can spend your money on. I don't think Trump is going to spend it on Bitcoin. As important as Bitcoin is to his brothers, there are many other interested parties who want borrowed money in their pockets.” Finally, Hayes acknowledged that the optimism in the crypto community regarding the Bitcoin reserve is overwhelming, saying, “I hope I'm wrong.” *This is not investment advice.

However, the opposite scenario is also common, making the crypto market famous for its volatility. Recently, a crypto trader, regarded as a whale due to its long holding, faced continuous market volatility and lost millionaire status in just 16 hours. How? Let’s discuss. Crypto Trader Loses Millionaire States to Memecoin Volatility After a slump, the crypto market began recovering, sending many new milestones. The expectations are even higher for the next four years, as Donald Trump is now the 47 U.S. president. More importantly, Trump launched his official memecoin. In this period of bullishness, crypto became the victim of volatility. Here, a series of trades turn the trader’s millionaire status. All this happened within 16 hours when the crypto trader known for its bets was left with misfortunes. This trader has invested heavily in Barron but gained losses only, so it sold all at the bottom. The trader spent nearly a million dollars on three trending Meme Coins to recover the losses. However, he is now left with just $40k, becoming the prime example of FOMO and misjudgments. Barron, TRUMP & Fartcoin Meme Coins Drowned The Trader More According to the PostedGo X post , a crypto whale invested in three popular meme coins, but every investment was lost. This began with TRUMP, Donald Trump’s official meme coin . It is a new market sensation with high volatility, resulting in frequent drops. The crypto trader lost to the same. After this, the trader opted for another meme cryptocurrency, Elon Hitler (Etler), which also failed. Despite having the name Elon, this meme coin had no connection to Elon Musk , but there is speculation about him launching one someday. The investor’s Etler loss pushed him to Fartcoin, which had a history of gains. However, to the investor’s bad luck, this failed again, leaving him with just $40,697 out of his $1M investment. What’s The Lesson For You? Meme coins built their image in 2024, when many, like PEPE and others, offered heavy returns. However, these returns are built on community hype and viral marketing, which does not last long, resulting in losses for late investors. The same happened with the aforementioned crypto trader, who invested when the hype declined. However, another bigger mistake was selling these coins even at a loss rather than waiting for recovery. This is why the investor lost $60k, as the person moved to the next trade, hoping to settle the loss. The crypto trading industry is a challenging sport, where various miscellaneous events affect crypto prices, so investment with proper research, risk management, and much more is needed to stay profitable in the market.

On Tuesday, the lead developer drew attention to the dog-themed meme coin on X, sharing Mark’s post highlighting why it is among one of the most prominent players across the meme crypto sector. As a result, crypto traders and investors are again bullish on one of the leading dog-themed meme coins in terms of market cap. Shiba Inu Lead Reacts On Marc Cuban’s SHIB Comment In an X post dated January 21, Mark spotlights why meme coins like SHIB and Dogecoin have worked. Particularly in the wake of the community’s long-term prospects and a sustainable way that benefits holders long term, the American billionaire lauds the Shytoshi Kusama-backed crypto project. Notably, Mark stated, “It’s why Doge, Shibu Inu and only a few others have worked. It’s about the community long term.” Further, replying to this post, Shiba Inu lead Shytoshi Kusama stated, “Oh and it’s SHIBA INU.” Kusama again posted on X , adding, “Why not align with us here at Shib,” calling out Mark. “Take a 10 minute call and see that it’s not just community but real technology that keeps us going,” he further added. Cuban Calls Out On New Meme Coins Meanwhile, it’s noteworthy that these comments on meme coins come against the backdrop of broader discussions revolving around the newly launched TRUMP token. CoinGape reported that Mark Cuban slammed TRUMP coin ‘s dynamics, undermining its credibility. Further, Cuban said in another post, “If meme coins are the way, maybe I’ll issue one. With a twist. Same terms as TRUMP.” This statement has further set off market discussions as the so-called twist will be that all revenue from sales of the token will go to the U.S. Treasury, per Cuban. Nevertheless, the saga has altogether garnered significant attention toward the Shiba Inu coin. SHIB Price Takes Heat However, despite the recent comment from the Shiba Inu lead, the leading meme coin’s price dipped today. At the time of reporting, SHIB price was down 6% intraday and is sitting at $0.00001979. The coin’s 24-hour low and high were $0.00001968 and $0.00002194, respectively. Despite Mark Cuban’s appraisal, the meme coin waned against the backdrop of the broader sector’s movement. Nevertheless, market participants continue to eye Shiba Inu optimistically against the backdrop of broader developments. CoinGape reported that lead developer Shyotshi Kusama claimed a “big week ahead” for the token’s community. This statement has sparked speculations of looming advancements for the meme token. Also, a SHIB price analysis by CoinGape revealed that the token could be hitting a new ATH, driven by soaring market optimism amid Donald Trump’s inauguration. Crypto market participants continue to monitor the meme coin for further price action shifts.

For instance, BlockDAG(BDAG) passed its $100m presale threshold for the first time in months, and POPCAT fell 7.5%. Speaking of POPCAT, POPCAT is gearing up for a big party. But it is PEPETO that’s really taking the limelight with its revolutionary tokenomics. Looking at its community backing and project roadmap, Pepeto is positioning itself as an icon in the memecoin space, while POPCAT continues to reign supreme in meme chatter. We want to discuss Popcat’s dip and rally, and how it relates to Pepeto’s success. Read on! PEPETO: Outpacing Rivals With Innovation Pepeto (PEPETO) is quickly becoming one of the main contenders in the memecoin market. The current presale, now at over $3.8 million, underscores its increasing popularity among retail investors and whales. In contrast to other memecoins that are largely hype-driven, Pepeto brings practicable value through its ecosystem. At the moment, pepeto’s price stands at $0.000000105 per token. A New Year’s Message from the God of Frogs As the New Year begins, the God of Frogs, Pepeto Himself, shares a message of triumph and faith for the loyal Pepeto Army: The Plan Unfolds: The roadmap progresses flawlessly, as foretold. Every milestone has been achieved, and the… pic.twitter.com/zCmy1bTRQY — Pepeto (@Pepetocoin) January 1, 2025 Further, pepetoSwap, the decentralized exchange, makes trading tokens easy with staking rewards of up to 385%. Pepeto’s future announcement – PepetoBridge, a cross-chain interoperability solution – reinforces Pepeto’s status as an innovative initiative. There is also the planned launch of an NFT marketplace which will allow users to mint and trade virtual collectibles. Pepeto’s meteoric rise has drawn interest as well because of its showmanship. Since January 2025, the token price has been climbing steadily due to its demand and unique selling proposition. Investors believe it will grow 50x, making it one of the year’s best buys. POPCAT’s Call-To-Arms POPCAT is planning a major rally thanks to the support of its devoted fans. Recently, a $2M whale purchase came through for the project. Despite its deflationary tokenomics and viral appeal, POPCAT continues to attract short-term returns investors. Developers are also experimenting with gamified products and partnerships to drive usage so the token can remain relevant. Why PEPETO Is Gaining Ground POPCAT is all about memes, but PEPETO merges jokes with practical applications. Pepeto’s democratic governance system, administered through the Pepeto DAO, keeps the project attuned to its investors. Staking incentives and a decentralized marketplace have made it a useful tool both for people in crypto novices and whales. With the memecoin market volatility, Pepeto is proving that memecoins aren’t only entertaining but can be valuable.

Ramaswamy’s decision to exit DOGE was announced hours after President Donald Trump officially began his second term in office, leaving Elon Musk as the sole leader of the cost-cutting advisory group. In a Jan. 21 X post , the 39-year-old entrepreneur said he was honored to support the creation of DOGE, expressing confidence in Musk and the team’s ability to “succeed in streamlining government.” Without elaborating on his future plans, Ramaswamy said he would have “more to say very soon” about his future plans, particularly in Ohio, while reaffirming his commitment to helping President Trump “make America great again.” According to people familiar with the matter, Ramaswamy, who is an Ohio native, is preparing to announce his candidacy for Ohio governor, with reports indicating he sees this as the next step in his political career. If elected, he would succeed Governor Mike DeWine, whose second and final term is set to end in January 2027 due to term limits. The Ohio gubernatorial election is scheduled for November 2026. Anna Kelly, an official from DOGE, confirmed Ramaswamy’s plans to “run for elected office” in comments to the Associated Press. According to Kelly, this required him to step away from the organization due to its “structure,” which prohibits active members from pursuing political campaigns. The development follows reports of growing tensions between Ramaswamy and Musk, with sources citing an X post by Ramaswamy in December criticizing American culture as a tipping point for the Tesla CEO.

Insiders described the situation as a culmination of “burned bridges” within Trump’s circle, hastening his departure from the advisory group. Amid this backdrop, DOGE has come under fire for revising the ambitious budget-cutting goals it set at its inception. Initially touted as a game-changing advisory group capable of slashing $2 trillion from the federal budget, the organization has faced skepticism after Musk suggested a more modest $1 trillion target as a realistic outcome. As previously reported by crypto.news, critics, including tech journalist Kara Swisher, have cited DOGE’s lack of real authority to enforce budget cuts as a key limitation, questioning its ability to achieve meaningful results.

Thousands Of Investors Race To Remittix ICO,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/solana-price-prediction-can-sol-hit-400-before-february-thousands-of-investors-race-to-remittix-ico/,"Solana has turned red, hovering near the $260 level after hitting a new all-time high of $295.83 the previous day. Per Artemis data , SOL’s DEX trading volume also hit a new high of $27 billion, bolstered by the rise of TRUMP and MELANIA meme coins in the Solana Blockchain. The technical perspective and on-chain metrics suggest a continuation of the rally as its Total Value Locked (TVL) and fees generated hit record levels. At the same time, Remittix (RTX) presale momentum has caught the eyes of investors, thanks to its practical application in a highly lucrative sector. Combining blockchain efficiency and real-world utility, Remittix is poised to capture significant market share and become a top investment opportunity like Solana. Let’s uncover why these tokens are among the top investment choices in 2025. SOL Price Eyes $400 Milestone Before February The Solana price broke above its descending trendline on January 17 and rallied by over 34% to hit a new all-time high of $295.83 on January 19. However, the rally pulled back sharply to retest its daily support of $230. This region aligns with the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of $168.88 low and high of $295.83, making it a critical reversal zone. The SOL coin has now rebounded near the $260 level. If the token continues with the upward momentum, it could extend its rally to retest its all-time high of $295.83. A successful close above this level could trigger more rallies towards the psychological level at $300. Any additional bullish momentum could push the price of Solana towards the $350 and $400 levels. Its RSI has been hovering around 69, highlighting bullish momentum. In any case, traders have remained cautious as the SOL token has entered overbought levels. The chances of a pullback could increase. Another probable scenario could be its RSI remaining above overbought levels and the SOL token continuing to rally. Recently, Solana TVL spiked from $10.11 billion to $14.24 billion in January, its highest level since its launch. This reflects growing activity and interest within the Solana ecosystem. Moreover, it generated $34.27 million in fees on January 20, a new all-time high daily, further boosting the bullish outlook. Overall, SOL crypto’s strong market performance has placed it among the top cryptocurrencies to watch in this cycle. Why Remittix (RTX) Is Among Top Investments in 2025 Remittix (RTX) is changing cross-border transactions as we know it. It deftly combines blockchain technology with traditional banking, allowing users to easily convert over 40 cryptos into fiat and deposit the money to any bank account worldwide. Unlike standard systems that charge hidden fees and lag, Remittix offers fast 24-hour transfers with an easy flat fee model. This straightforward approach appeals to individuals and businesses seeking predictable international transaction costs. Notably, BlockSAFU and SolidProof have verified Remittix’s advanced security protocols and smart contracts to ensure further transparency and build trust in the ecosystem. The project has empowered companies to adopt crypto payments through the Remittix Pay API. With this, merchants can accept crypto payments and receive settlements in their bank accounts. It supports more than 40 fiat currencies and over 50 crypto pairs. This flexibility has given businesses an edge in working efficiently across multiple markets. What is even more interesting is its focus on financial inclusivity. Remittix aims to assist the underbanked and unbanked by eliminating dependency on traditional banking infrastructure and offering access to global financial services. Its standout low-cost structure and 24/7 availability have enabled the platform to eliminate financial barriers. Notably, $RTX token holders can earn staking rewards of up to 8% APY for standard investors and up to 18% APY for Tier-3 premium members. The rewarding structure fosters loyalty and promotes long-term engagement. So far, Remittix is selling for only $0.0228, marking an over 50% leap from its starting price of $0.015. Meanwhile, it has raised over $4 million as investors continue being bullish about it. SOL Vs RTX: Which Token Could Offer Higher Short-Term Gains Solana and Remittix have shown strong investor confidence in the past few weeks. The SOL technical perspective and on-chain metrics suggest continuing the current rally. With a smaller market capitalization and higher growth potential, Remittix’s price seems ready to jump at the presale. With an expected 800% growth during presale and over 5,000% post-launch, Remittix could offer greater returns in the short term.

39249539,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=316667,1737446648,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/dailyhodl.png,"Here’s What Gives TRUMP Memecoin Its Value, According to CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju",https://dailyhodl.com/2025/01/21/heres-what-gives-trump-memecoin-its-value-according-to-cryptoquant-ceo-ki-young-ju/,"The chief executive of the digital asset analytics firm CryptoQuant is outlining what gives President Donald Trump’s newly launched memecoin value. The Official Trump ( TRUMP ) memecoin launched on Friday and rapidly surged in price to become a top-30 crypto asset by market cap. The asset is trading at $40.47 at time of writing and is down nearly 40% in the past 24 hours but up more than 518% since Friday. It already has a market cap of more than $8.1 billion. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju says retail traders think that financial markets are all about following trends and “chasing memes.” “What gives Trump’s meme coin its value? Unlike traditional securities, which pool investments for productive activities, celebrity meme coins don’t directly create value. Instead, Trump is likely to use his coin holders as a powerful community base for collective action. If you’re thinking about investing in Trump Coin, the key question is how much influence his community will gain during his presidency. The coin’s value depends entirely on what Trump does. With his fervent fan base, it’s unlikely Trump’s meme coin will ever go to zero – unless he deliberately pulls the rug.” Young Ju says a memecoin’s value depends on whether its associated community acts in ways that benefit society. “A community with goodwill could turn a meme coin into a valuable asset. But on the flip side, it would be terrifying if a cult or terrorist group used a meme coin to build a massive following.” The CryptoQuant executive also predicts that more memecoins will be launched under Trump’s administration. “The Trump administration has embraced free markets instead of regulated markets, and over the next four years, we’re likely to see all kinds of experiments with meme-driven communities in the crypto space. This wave is unstoppable – at least until 2028.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

It’s now time for savvy investors to search for altcoins that are set to deliver explosive gains. As we anticipate the next bull wave, choosing the right tokens could lead to life-changing returns. Among numerous assets, experts have picked Shiba Inu (SHIB), Ripple (XRP), and DTX Exchange (DTX) as standout contenders this January. They believe these altcoins hold immense potential and can offer massive investment returns. Today’s article considers their fundamentals and growing utility, which make these altcoins the top picks. Ripple (XRP) Is Poised For Massive Gains in 2025 Ripple is a top coin that could deliver nice returns soon. For the first time since 2018, the XRP price reached $3.40. Patient investors have enjoyed over 600% gains since its breakout in November 2024. Interestingly, there’s growing speculation about the XRP spot ETF, which could increase investor interest. Despite ongoing regulatory hurdles, Ripple’s past legal victories have reinforced investor confidence. This is evident in over 100,000 users holding at least $100k worth of XRP tokens. In the past week alone, XRP gained over 26% , driven by large-scale investor activity. While top technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index suggest overbought conditions, experts are optimistic that Ripple will deliver more gains soon. This makes it a top asset to watch out for this month. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Might Breakout in January 2025 Another altcoin this January 2025 is Shiba Inu. This asset finds itself at a critical junction as bulls and bears affect its price. Interestingly, on-chain data reveals changes in investor behavior, which signals a potential shift in the token’s price growth. Reports noted that large wallets holding over 77 trillion SHIB are redistributing their tokens in preparation for the next market cycle. Also, smaller wallets containing 1-10 billion SHIB are increasing. This proves that SHIB continues to attract newer investors. However, recent price action may paint a challenging situation. SHIB dropped about 5% in the past week to $0.000022, and technical indicators hint at potential downside risks. Still, savvy investors believe this price could be a potential buy zone before it rebounds soon. DTX Exchange (DTX) Reshapes The Trading Market with its Hybrid Approach Lastly, we have DTX Exchange , a viral altcoin set to transform the online trading space with its hybrid approach. It seamlessly combines the strengths of centralized and decentralized exchanges on a secure platform. Thus, it offers access to hundreds of financial assets — from stocks and forex to cryptos and ETFs. This makes DTX Exchange the first crypto-native platform to deliver comprehensive asset management in a single hub. Additionally, the VulcanX blockchain powers DTX Exchange. It delivers ultra-fast speeds and reliable functionality. Its testnet data reveals that this chain could process over 200,000 transactions per second (TPS) and execute trades in just 0.04 seconds. This speed, coupled with the platform’s 1,000x leverage, allows traders to turn modest investments into higher liquidity. Furthermore, DTX Exchange prioritizes security and user control by offering non-custodial storage and wallet-based trading. These features ensure users retain full ownership of their assets. Unlike traditional exchanges, DTX Exchange creates a transparent and safe trading environment that inspires trust and confidence. For investors, DTX’s current seventh presale round could be a sweet spot to enter. The DTX token, priced at just $0.14, gives users a chance to secure substantial returns before its official listing on crypto exchanges. With this unique blend of performance and versatility, analysts hail DTX as the best altcoin to invest in right now. Wrapping Up Ripple (XRP), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and DTX Exchange (DTX) present incredible opportunities for investors looking to unlock life-changing gains. While SHIB and XRP show strong potential for recovery, DTX Exchange stands out as a frontrunner, thanks to its vast asset offerings, lightning-fast transaction speeds, and innovative Phoenix Wallet. The DTX token is currently in its presale stage and is already seeing massive demand. For traders eager to ride the next big wave, this is the right moment to secure significant returns.

39252038,https://timestabloid.com/?p=55107,1737450063,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Breaking: SEC Gets New Boss. New Hope For Ripple and XRP,https://timestabloid.com/breaking-sec-gets-new-boss/,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) are undergoing significant leadership transitions, potentially signaling a shift in regulatory strategies for the cryptocurrency industry. These changes come amidst growing calls for clearer rules and a more collaborative approach to addressing the unique challenges posed by digital assets. Mark Uyeda Named Acting SEC Chairman Republican Commissioner Mark Uyeda has been appointed acting chairman of the SEC, following the end of Gary Gensler’s term. Uyeda steps into this role as the agency faces criticism for its aggressive enforcement actions under Gensler’s leadership. Known for his vocal opposition to the SEC’s “regulation through enforcement” approach, Uyeda has described it as a “disaster” for the cryptocurrency sector. While Uyeda assumes the interim role, Paul Atkins, CEO of Patomak Global Partners, remains the nominee to replace Gensler. Atkins, a former SEC commissioner with a history of supporting market-friendly regulations, awaits Senate confirmation. Uyeda was previously seen as a strong contender for the permanent chairmanship, raising speculation about the direction the SEC might take during his tenure as acting chair. CFTC Leadership: Caroline Pham Takes the Helm In a parallel development, Commissioner Caroline Pham has been selected to serve as the acting chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) , according to Bloomberg. Pham is well-regarded for her forward-thinking stance on cryptocurrency regulation, particularly her advocacy for “regulatory sandboxes.” These frameworks allow emerging crypto firms to test their products and services under limited regulatory oversight, fostering innovation while ensuring consumer protection. Pham has consistently pushed for clear policies to guide the rapidly evolving crypto industry, emphasizing the need for tailored approaches that address its complexities. Her appointment aligns with the CFTC’s historical emphasis on fostering innovation while maintaining robust oversight. Candidates for Permanent Leadership Roles Both agencies are on track to select permanent chairs, and the choices could shape the future of cryptocurrency regulation in the U.S. At the SEC, Paul Atkins awaits confirmation, while Pham is a leading contender for the CFTC top job. Another frontrunner at the CFTC is Brian Quintenz, the current head of crypto policy at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. Quintenz, a former CFTC commissioner, has long advocated for regulatory frameworks that accommodate innovation without stifling growth. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A Potential Shift in Regulatory Strategy The leadership transitions come at a critical time for the cryptocurrency industry, which has struggled under the weight of unclear and often punitive regulatory actions. The SEC, under Gensler , adopted a hardline approach, pursuing numerous enforcement actions against crypto companies for alleged violations. However, recent reports suggest that a Republican-led SEC may consider freezing or dropping non-fraud cases, signaling a possible pivot toward a more measured strategy. Similarly, Pham’s leadership at the CFTC could bring a collaborative and innovation-friendly approach to regulation. Her emphasis on sandboxes and transparent policies reflects a broader recognition of balancing oversight with the potential benefits of blockchain technology and digital assets. Implications for Ripple and Crypto Industry The dual leadership transitions at the SEC and CFTC have raised hopes for a more constructive regulatory environment. With Uyeda and Pham at the helm, the focus may shift toward fostering innovation while addressing legitimate issues concerning fraud and investor protection. In December, Uyeda suggested that the SEC might ease its enforcement actions in non-fraud cases while providing greater regulatory clarity for digital asset firms. His remarks were promising signals to the crypto industry, especially for Ripple and XRP, which have endured years of legal battle with the regulatory agency. With Uyeda now at the helm of affairs, an end to Ripple case is highly anticipated. As the agencies navigate these transitions, the industry will watch closely to see how interim leaders shape policy and influence the broader regulatory landscape. Whether these changes represent a temporary shift or the beginning of a long-term transformation depends on the individuals selected for permanent leadership roles. For now, the appointments of Uyeda and Pham provide a glimpse of potential progress in bridging the gap between regulators and the crypto industry.

Which One Of These Will Make The Highest Returns For Investors And Why",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/pepe-shiba-inu-or-remittix-in-2025-which-one-of-these-will-make-the-highest-returns-for-investors-and-why/,"The crypto market is full of new opportunities, especially with the ongoing bull run set for another massive pump. Analysts have chosen PEPE, Shiba Inu and fast rising Remittix ($RTX) as the best altcoins that could offer the highest returns for investors. With innovative blockchain powered solutions for cross-border payments, a new rival, Remittix (RTX) is gently transforming the financial scene. Many analysts consider it the best crypto to buy now for huge gains. . Top Altcoins Prediction: PEPE Is Poised For Explosive Growth In April to May 2023, PEPE surged, reaching a market cap of $1.6 billion, creating millionaires from early investors. This fueled interest in memecoins, sparking significant price movements in the market. Like the other best cheap cryptocurrencies, Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, PEPE captured attention with its no tax policy and straightforward approach. The roadmap outlines three phases aimed at increasing visibility and listings on major exchanges, with a focus on Twitter trends and a so-called “meme takeover.” The long-term potential remains a point of interest for enthusiasts. As a result, many investors consider PEPE to be one of top altcoins to buy now. Analysts See Huge Returns On Shiba Inu (SHIB) SHIB closed the year with a solid 104% year on year price rise in 2024 after massive upside surges. Beginning 2024 at roughly $0.000010, the meme coin crossed $0.00002 by December. Past performances of Shiba Inu’s SHIB reveal an intriguing narrative. Except for 2022, when it lost 75.8%, most years have ended well with upside trends. While this upward trend may not be flawless, it demonstrates the Shiba Inu token’s ability to recover and expand, even following an 80% correction. The Shiba Inu’s SHIB’s staying above $0.00002 at the end of every year suggests this becoming the new baseline for the cryptocurrency value. According to analysts’ prediction, Shiba Inu will rank among the top altcoins during the 2025 bull run. Remittix Set For a Massive Surge From their 2017 worth of roughly $150 trillion to $250 trillion by 2027, cross-border payments under creative swap-in exchange are estimated to have grown significantly. By fusing the strength of blockchain technology with conventional banking systems, Remittix is gaining market share in this enormous industry and developing a smooth and effective solution for international transactions. Remittix allows customers to exchange more than 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat money swiftly. Then, these monies may be sent straight to any bank account worldwide. Remittix stands out for its simplicity. Recipients receive a usual bank transfer, unaware that it began as a cryptocurrency payment. Thanks to its innovative features, users can handle their funds with total autonomy and flexibility. The platform targets prominent rivals such as Coinbase, Wise and Stripe. However, unlike these traditional competitors, Remittix has the unique capability of sending money via cryptocurrency, converting it and depositing it immediately into a bank account. Businesses may now accept cryptocurrency payments from clients and process fiat transactions to a specified bank account thanks to Remittix’s Pay API. Companies may also set up merchant accounts, which give them complete control over how they pay out their cryptocurrency and provide them access to more than 50 cryptocurrency pairings and more than 30 fiat currencies. Remittix (RTX) is seeing a sharp increase in investor interest. The enthusiasm is evident with tokens priced at only $0.0228 and over $4 million raised in the $RTX presale. Experts in the market predict a stunning 5,000% increase after launch and an 800% jump before the conclusion of the presale. With Remittix at the forefront, now is the perfect time to explore the possibilities of cross-border payments.

The Trump family contributed to the developments as they officially joined the meme tokens space on Monday. However, the new themed tokens have slumped over the past day, losing up to 65% of their value. Such trends have attracted discussions of utility over hype, and iDEGEN appears as the option as it combines virility and unique use cases. iDEGEN is an AI-centered crypto project that went viral over the past weeks due to its inimitability. It has witnessed massive commitment from savvy investors, with IDGN ICO raising nearly $17.5 million (so far). Let’s assess why iDEGEN might be perfect for individuals searching for lucrative long-term gems. Trump family tokens slump TRUMP (Official Trump) dominated crypto trends on Monday following explosive surges to ATHs above $70. While many expected the alt to hit $100 amidst the inauguration , massive bearishness emerged hours before the ceremony. TRUMP began plummeting after Trump’s wife launched her MELANIA meme token . The former trades at $36.80 after dropping nearly 40% of its value within the past day. MELANIA joined the bloodbath, sliding from yesterday’s peak above $13 to $4.08 at press time. Chart by Coinmarketcap The altcoin remains poised for extended losses or consolidation unless massive catalysts emerge. However, prevailing trends suggest faded interest in the latest PolitiFi coins. The crypto community has criticized the president’s family after the ‘rug pulls.” While analysts believe the inauguration doesn’t determine cryptos’ future , whales have reduced their meme exposure after the ceremony. On-chain analytics platforms have highlighted two large-scale investors and their TRUMP transactions. Whale Alert shows one investor moved TRUMP worth over $67.39 million (1.621,351 tokens). Whale Alert @whale_alert · Follow 🚨 🚨 🚨 1,621,351 #TRUMP (67,392,467 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to unknown wallet whale-alert.io/transaction/so… 12:35 am · 21 Jan 2025 318 Reply Copy link Read 28 replies The transfer happened after the president’s speech, signaling an imminent dump. Also, another player sold TRUMP coins worth about $6.83 million, 194,799 assets after Trump’s oath. Notably, the investor lost $2.55M after the transaction. The prevailing bearish wave could intensify large-scale selloffs, triggering more crashes for Trump-linked memes. iDEGEN: The unstoppable meme coin While new themed tokens fail to keep pace, iDEGEN continues to flex its muscles. The project uses AI to learn from Crypto Twitter and post on X every hour. However, its wild comments on the social site—ranging from philosophy to conspiracies— have resulted in bans as well. Meanwhile, that didn’t stop the IDGN community as investors continued to pour money into the project. X lifted the ban yesterday, which iDEGEN cheered, stating that even massive firms such as BlackRock can’t stop it. The AI experiment seems unavoidable since it’s everywhere. Besides the hype, IDGN’s roadmap highlights notable volatility, cementing the project’s long-term presence in the crypto world. Source – iDEGEN IDGN trades at $0.038 and early adopters have netted over 10,900% in profits. With its current momentum, iDEGEN looks to revolutionize the meme crypto world after its exchange debut on 27 February. You can visit IDGN’s official website for more details.

While the timing and magnitude of this move raised eyebrows, it also highlighted WLFI’s strategy to solidify its presence in the digital asset market. The acquisition, which included Ether, Wrapped Bitcoin, and other tokens, signals WLFI’s ambition to leverage crypto as a cornerstone of its financial model amidst shifting global financial dynamics.

The decision to expand its crypto portfolio aligns with WLFI’s broader financial strategy. By investing in high-liquidity assets like Ether and Bitcoin, alongside niche tokens, WLFI is positioning itself as a significant player in the DeFi landscape. This diversification also serves as a hedge against market volatility, offering stability to its $300 million treasury, which has been bolstered by successful token sales. Token sales driving financial momentum Since October 2024, WLFI has sold 20% of its token supply, raising $300 million through pre-sales. A new tranche of tokens, representing an additional 5% of the supply, was made available immediately after Trump’s inauguration. These token sales highlight the increasing appetite for decentralised financial projects, particularly those associated with high-profile figures like Trump. A significant endorsement came from Tron DAO, led by founder Justin Sun, which increased its investment in WLFI to $75 million. Sun, who joined WLFI as an advisor in November, described the partnership as a “transformative step” for both projects. H.E.

Head to BTFD for Maximum Gains,https://thecoinrise.com/top-meme-coin-presales-to-buy-today-regret-missing-out-on-bome-head-to-btfd-for-maximum-gains/,"Meme coins have taken the crypto world by storm, evolving from fun internet experiments into serious investment opportunities. Over the years, we’ve seen coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu turn casual investors into overnight success stories. Now, the next wave of meme coins is here, and two presales are making big headlines— BTFD Coin (BTFD) and Book of Meme (BOME). These coins are attracting attention not just for their meme-worthy branding but also for their innovative features and growth potential. Let’s dive into why these two are the top meme coin presales to buy today and how they compare. If you’re eyeing BOME but worried about missing out, let’s put that fear to rest. While BOME has potential, BTFD Coin’s explosive presale performance and innovative features give it the edge. With a robust ecosystem, staking rewards, and its referral program, BTFD is positioning itself as the meme coin to beat. BTFD Coin: The Game-Changer in Meme Coins BTFD Coin is making waves as one of the top meme coin presales to buy today , and it’s not hard to see why. The coin’s presale has been a massive success, raisi ng over $5.2 million and selling more than 64 billion coins to 8,400 holders. At its current Stage 13 price of $0.000142, investors have a golden opportunity to get in early before it hits its $0.0006 listing pri ce. One of BTFD’s standout features is its referral program . It’s simple—share your unique link, invite friends to join, and earn rewards when they invest. This program is a win-win, not only growing the community but also putting extra tokens in your wallet. It’s perfect for those who want to make the most of their investment while helping the project thrive. BTFD also brings something fresh to the table with its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game. This isn’t just about earning tokens; it’s about creating an immersive experience where players can have fun and build wealth simultaneously. Add to that the Bulls Squad, a tight-knit community of investors who are actively driving the project forward, and you’ve got a recipe for success. Now, let’s talk numbers. If you invest $7,500 at the current Stage 13 price, you’d snag 52,816,901 BTFD coins. When the price hits $0.0006 after the presale, your investment would balloon to an impressive $31,690. That’s the kind of return that’s hard to i gnore. Analysts are already buzzing about BTFD’s post-launch potential, predicting it could outperform many of its peers once it hits major exchanges. With its innovative features and strong presale momentum, BTFD is shaping up to be one of the most promising meme coins of 2025. Book of Meme: A Fun, Community-Driven Contender Book of Meme (BOME) is another meme coin that’s caught the crypto world’s attention. With its tongue-in-cheek branding and emphasis on community, BOME has built a loyal following. The coin’s developers have leaned into humor and creativity, making it a fun and approachable option for first-time crypto investors. BOME’s ecosystem focuses heavily on storytelling and gamification. The “Book of Meme” concept invites users to participate in a virtual world where they can earn rewards, trade NFTs, and unlock unique content. It’s a playful approach that resonates with younger audiences looking for something different. Crypto analysts predict steady growth for BOME, especially if it continues to engage its community with fresh updates and partnerships. However, compared to BTFD, it lacks some of the robust financial incentives like high staking rewards or a referral program. While BOME is a solid project, it feels more niche, catering to those who prioritize fun over long-term financial returns. Why BTFD Stands Out Among the Top Meme Coin Presales to Buy Today BTFD Coin’s presale is your chance to get in on what could be the next big thing in meme coins. Its explosive start, coupled with its innovative features, makes it a standout option for investors. Whether it’s the high APY on staking, the engaging P2E game, or the rewards-rich referral program, BTFD is ticking all the right boxes. If you’re ready to jump in, here’s how to get started. Visit the official presale page , connect your wallet (MetaMask or Trust Wallet work great), and input the amount you want to invest. Review the discounted price, hit “Buy Now,” and confirm your transaction. That’s it—you’re now part of one of the hottest crypto projects of 2025. Conclusion Based on our research, BTFD Coin and Book of Meme are two of the top meme coin presales to buy today , but BTFD takes the crown. Its explosive presale performance, innovative features, and strong community backing make it the smarter choice for long-term growth. Don’t miss out on this wealth-generation opportunity— join the BTFD Coin presale now and position yourself for potentially life-changing returns. The future of meme coins is here, and BTFD is leading the charge.

The investment manager noted that portfolios with allocations to bitcoin are consistently outperforming those that don't hold the world's largest cryptocurrency. Asset managers need to integrate the digital asset into multi-asset portfolios or ""risk falling behind in a rapidly evolving financial landscape,"" wrote analyst Dovile Silenskyte, adding that bitcoin adoption is expected to grow this year as more clients demand exposure to the asset class. The launch of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. helped take crypto more mainstream in 2024. This momentum is expected to continue this year as the regulatory environment becomes more friendly in the U.S. under President Trump, and as more countries approve exchange-traded products (ETPs) for altcoins such as solana 's SOL and XRP , WisdomTree said. ""This next wave of altcoin ETPs will expand the diversity of crypto investment opportunities and further integrate cryptocurrencies into the global financial system,"" Silenskyte wrote. The Ethereum blockchain's role as the ""backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and Web3 is unmatched,"" the report said, but its scalability issues are still a problem. Still, recent upgrades including Dencun are expected to drive layer-2 adoption on the blockchain, the report noted. Stablecoins are ""becoming indispensable to the global financial system,"" and networks such as Solana are ideal for stablecoin payments and remittances, WisdomTree said. Tokenization , the process of putting the ownership of real world assets on the blockchain, will expand dramatically in 2025, and will transform industries from private equity to venture capital, the report added.

Analysis Company Announces Short-Term Forecast!",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/trump-skipped-bitcoin-price-dropped-what-will-happen-to-bitcoin-price-next-analysis-company-announces-short-term-forecast/,"Donald Trump was sworn into office as President of the United States yesterday. However, Trump's failure to make a statement about cryptocurrencies at the inauguration ceremony and his failure to sign the expected decree on Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies caused sharp declines in the crypto market, especially Bitcoin. While some experts say that uncertainty about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies' decrees is increasing the pressure on prices, Matrixport analysts say that BTC still has significant upside potential in the short term. Cryptocurrency analysis platform Matrixport shared the January 21 chart in its analysis from the X account, saying that Bitcoin has been trading in an increasingly narrowing wedge range since mid-November of last year. Stating that higher-than-expected inflation data and the FED's hawkish stance affected market sentiment, Matrixport analysts said that in the face of these negativities, positive expectations that Trump would launch a potential Bitcoin reserve provided support to the BTC price and prevented a larger pullback. Analysts noted that Bitcoin was consolidating within the wedge range until Trump’s inauguration on January 20, indicating that this was a bullish signal for BTC. Noting that BTC is currently retesting the breakout level that coincides exactly with the upper boundary of the wedge range, Matrixport analysts emphasized that if BTC can maintain this important support level, there is still significant bullish potential in the short term. “Since mid-November, Bitcoin has been trading within a narrowing wedge. On the negative side, they include higher-than-expected inflation and a more hawkish Federal Reserve. On the positive side, optimism around President Trump potentially establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve helped maintain momentum and prevent a deeper decline. The consolidation inside the wedge continued until Trump’s inauguration and served as a catalyst for Bitcoin to make an upward breakout – a bullish signal. “Bitcoin is now retesting the breakout level corresponding to the upper boundary of the wedge. If Bitcoin holds above this key support, the short-term outlook remains very bullish, and the breakout signals renewed upward momentum.” *This is not investment advice.

Official Trump ( TRUMP ), a meme coin launched by President Donald Trump on Solana , has seen a dramatic price drop after Trump’s inauguration. In the past 24 hours, the price has tanked from $74 to just $38, sending some investors into panic mode. While it’s still unclear why the token took such a sharp dive, some link it to unrealized expectations surrounding Trump’s inauguration speech.

CANTO is a utility token linked to a permissionless layer 1 blockchain of the same name . Known for its compatibility with Ethereum Virtual Machine , Canto’s token was launched to be “completely decentralized,” without a core foundation, presale or ventures. Canto leverages Tendermint Consensus and Cosmos Software Development Kit and is secured by its own validators. Canto also uses the Ethermint system to gain EVM compatibility, which enables an EVM execution environment, further facilitating the deployment of Ethereum smart contracts. CANTO is not a governance token, claiming to enable users to engage with its offering for “free.” The Canto DEX itself claims to be ungoverned and cannot implement additional fees or launch new tokens. Therefore, the CANTO crypto is simply used to facilitate liquidity mining and staking on the Canto blockchain. In August last year, Canto reportedly had problems in producing blocks. The network had to stop block production as it was experiencing issues with its consensus mechanism, a process used by the blockchain to validate transactions.

As revealed by Scam Sniffer, the attackers take advantage of common programs which are for instance Homebrew – package manager for macOS which helps the attackers to gain trust from the users and steal wallet data. 1/7 SECURITY ALERT: Another case of malicious software distributed via Google Ads, targeting crypto users through fake Homebrew installers. Attackers are using fake ads to lure victims into downloading malware designed to steal crypto wallet data and drain assets. Here's how… https://t.co/6DEC0XnrjC pic.twitter.com/vfuKCsECo2 — Scam Sniffer | Web3 Anti-Scam (@realScamSniffer) January 20, 2025 How The Attack Works Phishers use identical Google links whereby they design fake Google Ads looking like normal promotion for Homebrew installers. When the user clicks these ads, he is diverted to the fake homepages that are similar to the official Homebrew home page. Once there, users download a malicious program and not the genuine software. Once executed, the malware specifically targets crypto users by Stealing browser data like Cookies, passwords, and extensions, harvesting crypto wallet files from Electrum, Exodus, Atomic Wallet, and Ledger Live, and inducing users to enter their system password. The malware also collects system info, keychain data, and Telegram files. The final aim is to steal victims’ money and transferring to the attacker owned accounts Why These Attacks Are Concerning Google Ads make such scams more legitimate and people are more likely to fall into them than in other scams that do not incorporate Google Ads. Thieves are taking advantage of users’ confidence in the popular social platforms and instruments to distribute their viruses. As these attacks grow more advanced, crypto users must take proactive steps to protect themselves: Avoid clicking on ads: As much as possible, go straight to the specific site rather than being led there by search engine ads. Verify URLs carefully: Be sure that it is the official website you entered and not a fake or look-alike website which could deceive and rip you off.

On January 21, Analog will kick off the launch of its $ANLOG token through a Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP) on Fjord Foundry. The event marks a significant step in Analog’s journey to establish a fully interoperable blockchain ecosystem. Running for 48 hours, the LBP aims to foster community-driven price discovery and equitable token access, reflecting Analog’s commitment to building open and decentralized infrastructure. Tokens purchased via the LBP will be fully unlocked in time for the forthcoming Token Generation Event (TGE). The $ANLOG LBP will be live on Fjord Foundry from January 21, 2025, 06:00 AM CET and run until January 23, 2025, 05:59 AM CET. $ANLOG Equal Access Through LBP LBPs, which have gained traction as a fair token distribution mechanism, utilize a dynamic pricing structure that adjusts based on participant demand. This approach contrasts with traditional token launches, where fixed prices often benefit larger, early participants at the expense of smaller contributors. By leveraging Fjord Foundry’s infrastructure, Analog will ensure that $ANLOG’s distribution is as broad as possible, which is ideal when launching a new token or network. For Analog, the choice to host its $ANLOG sale via an LBP on Fjord Foundry was an obvious one. LBPs are uniquely designed to democratize access to tokens by enabling prices to start high and decrease gradually over time until they stabilize based on market demand. This model ensures that contributors set the token’s valuation, avoiding the speculative surges often associated with conventional launches. Fjord Foundry’s community-focused token sale platform has supported a string of successful projects through its LBP framework. Its infrastructure aligns seamlessly with Analog’s goal of building an ecosystem that prioritizes accessibility and fairness for developers and end-users alike. Having recently closed a $5M seed round, taking its total funding to $21M, Analog is now well on course to achieve its goal of providing the interoperable layer to connect all major blockchains. $ANLOG in Action The $ANLOG token is central to Analog’s Layer 0 protocol that facilitates seamless cross-chain data and transaction flows. Analog’s flagship innovation, Timechain, enables decentralized applications to securely operate across multiple blockchains. This ensures developers are not siloed within a single network but can build solutions that transcend traditional boundaries. $ANLOG acts as the utility token within this ecosystem, empowering developers to interact with Analog’s cross-chain infrastructure. From paying transaction fees to incentivizing validator participation, $ANLOG is a cornerstone of Analog’s drive to create a scalable, interconnected web3 landscape. As Analog’s network grows, so too does the significance of $ANLOG in fostering cross-chain dapps that allow data and assets to flow freely. It can be hard to visualize what amorphous concepts such as interoperability look like in reality, but there’s already a taster of what the Analog community can expect in the form of Zenswap . Developed using Analog’s tech stack, the cross-chain DEX enables assets to be swapped across such chains as TON, Solana, and Bitcoin, using USDC-based routing. Once Analog’s mainnet deploys, it will be joined by a host of other omnichain dapps from over 50 partners that are already under development.

The LBP, lasting 48 hours, encourages community-driven price discovery and equal token access, aligning with Analog’s mission to develop open and decentralized infrastructure. Tokens acquired through the LBP will be fully available for the upcoming Token Generation Event (TGE). The $ANLOG LBP will be accessible on Fjord Foundry from 06:00 AM CET on January 21, 2025, until 05:59 AM CET on January 23, 2025. Ensuring Fairness in $ANLOG Access Through LBP LBPs have become popular for their fair token distribution, utilizing a dynamic pricing mechanism that adjusts according to participant interest. This method contrasts with traditional launches, where fixed prices often favor early large-scale investors over smaller ones. Using Fjord Foundry’s platform, Analog intends to ensure the widest possible distribution of $ANLOG, a crucial feature for launching new tokens or networks. Opting for an LBP on Fjord Foundry for its $ANLOG sale was a clear choice for Analog. LBPs are specifically crafted to democratize token access, starting with high prices that gradually decline until they stabilize based on market demand. This model allows participants to determine the token’s value, avoiding the speculative spikes common in traditional launches. Fjord Foundry’s community-centric token sale platform has successfully supported several projects with its LBP model. This infrastructure aligns perfectly with Analog’s vision of creating an ecosystem that emphasizes accessibility and fairness for both developers and users. With a recent $5M seed round, bringing its total funding to $21M, Analog is on track to provide the interoperable layer connecting all major blockchains. The Role of $ANLOG in Analog's Ecosystem The $ANLOG token is integral to Analog’s Layer 0 protocol, which facilitates smooth cross-chain data and transaction processes.

However, token prices have crashed by 60% in just one day, as traders react to Trump’s omission of crypto from his much-anticipated inaugural speech. Melania Token Price Plunge Before the inauguration, Melania’s MELANIA token reached a market value of $2 billion hitting a high of $11.41 . However, after Trump’s speech, it dropped to just $750 million, now settling at $4.91 reflecting a drop of almost 54%. The price drop fell drastically due to President Donald Trump’s inaugural speech omitted any mention of cryptocurrencies and blockchain. In addition to it, the fall was partly due to traders cashing out on the profit after the initial price surge. Many in the crypto community had high hopes that Trump’s inauguration speech would include mentions of cryptocurrency. Some expected him to announce a Bitcoin reserve or discuss crypto-friendly policies. But when Trump didn’t mention digital assets at all, the market reacted with disappointment, causing both meme coins to plummet. TRUMP Token Even Crashed Similarly, the Trump token saw its market cap fall from $13.72 billion to $8.27 billion while its price currently trades at $40.8 reflecting a drop of 28%. Before this drop, trading activity was very high, with $26.7 billion worth of tokens exchanged in just 24 hours, showing strong interest at the start.

Both these coins achieved massive growth in the initial hours post-launch. It seems that the buzz created by the Trump family-related meme coins has encouraged many to rethink their view of the meme coin sector. The recent announcement by American business leader Mark Cuban, who was once a highly vocal critic of meme coins, regarding his intention to launch a meme coin is the best example. Interestingly, for Cuban, his project is not ordinary, but extraordinary due to its vision. What’s his vision? Can his meme coin overturn the destiny of the US economy? Let’s examine! Mark Cuban’s Meme Coin Proposal In an X post published by Mark Cuban early today, he has expressed his intention to launch a meme coin, emphasising his plan to use the same terms as $TRUMP. This implies that his coin will have a 20% float. Reports suggest that Cuban’s coin will have a release schedule matching the Official Trump token. Meanwhile, what makes the meme coin of Mark Cuban unique is its plan to send all its revenues to the US Treasury. In short, Cuban’s meme coin aims to help reduce the US national debt through a transparent and community-driven approach. In December 2024, the US Government Debt grew from $36087363 Million to $36218605 Million. Cuban’s Assurances: Transparency and Accountability Cuban has assured the public that he will publish the treasury’s wallet address, emphasising his commitment to enabling public tracking. He has also promised to safeguard his meme coin from pump-and-dump schemes and false promises. Meme Coin Investors Concerns and Challenges Many X users, like artchick.eth, have raised concerns about investor risks and distribution hurdles. Cuban has also acknowledged the speculative nature of the meme coin sector, highlighting that the success of a meme coin depends on how quickly its community strength grows. $Trump has seen a massive drop of $31.5% in the last 24 hours, despite the tremendous growth it achieved in the initial hours post-launch. $MELANIA has also experienced a significant fall of -54.9% during the same period. The TRUMP price now stands at $40.03, and the MELANIA price at $4.94. In conclusion, Mark Cuban’s innovative idea combines crypto and public good.

Bitcoin (BTC) hit an all-time high of almost $110K but dropped to $102K after Trump’s inauguration, which lacked crypto mentions. Ripple (XRP) peaked at $3.30 before dipping to $3.08, though analysts remain optimistic about a potential rally. Trump-Themed Memes Went Crazy The past several days have been more than eventful for the cryptocurrency industry, whose global market capitalization briefly surpassed $3.8 trillion on January 20 before plunging to its current $3.65 trillion (per CoinGecko’s data). Perhaps the most apparent reason for the enhanced volatility was the hype surrounding Donald Trump’s official return to the White House as America’s 47th President. Besides taking center stage on the political scene, the Republican also made waves in the crypto sector, launching a meme coin of his own. The token, called Official Trump (TRUMP), saw the light of day on January 18. Shortly after, it experienced a spectacular price increase, and its market capitalization surged past $14.5 billion. As it often happens in the meme coin niche, though, the rally was followed by a painful correction. TRUMP is currently worth approximately $38, representing a nearly 50% decline from its peak. TRUMP Price, Source: CoinGecko Interestingly, the price started retracing minutes after Melania Trump (Donald Trump’s wife) also jumped on the meme coin bandwagon. She introduced Melania Meme (MELANIA), which at one point reached $2 billion in market cap. This rise was likely fueled by Binance, Bybit, and other leading crypto exchanges, which allowed trading services with the asset. Similar to TRUMP, though, MELANIA headed south in the following hours and is currently trading at around $4.50 (a 50% plunge on a 24-hour scale). MELANIA Price, Source: CoinGecko BTC’s New Peak The primary cryptocurrency experienced severe turbulence, too . As CryptoPotato reported , its price skyrocketed to a new all-time high of almost $110,000 on January 20. However, as the day progressed, BTC started losing steam. It tumbled below $102,000 minutes after Donald Trump’s inauguration. The Republican touched upon numerous topics during his speech but did not mention the cryptocurrency industry at all , which might explain why the asset underperformed. In the following hours, BTC reached a local bottom of around $100K before the bulls stepped in and pushed the valuation to the current $102,100. BTC Price, Source: CoinGecko XRP’s Price Swings Last but not least, we will focus on Ripple’s native token, whose price surpassed $3.30 at one point on January 20. Its solid performance coincided with the bullish environment in the entire crypto space and the increased whale activity. Nonetheless, the market decline in the past several hours has negatively affected XRP, and as of this writing, it is trading at roughly $3.08. XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko Despite the volatility, many analysts remain optimistic that a new ATH is just around the corner . Those include CRYPTOWZRD, who envisioned a rise to $4 in the short term, and Dark Defender, who predicted a push toward $5.80.

Is this case unique?,https://crypto.news/australian-couple-sold-their-land-in-a-btc-only-sale/,"Two couples of vendors in Ballarat exhibited their 582m² land block for sale, accepting only Bitcoin payments. Why do people sell real estate for crypto, and how does the latter disrupt the real estate market? Table of Contents The land in question Why did they sell it for Bitcoin? Do people often pay for real estate in crypto? Blockchain and the real estate sector The land in question The block at 7 Magpie Street was bought by vendors Melissa Bower and Trudy Purcell in 2021 with plans of renovating and turning this place into “something magnificent.” Ballarat itself is a picturesque place that is not far away from several attractions like Sovereign Hill. However, the property itself needed some tweaking. At the time when the couple bought this land, it was just an old miners’ cottage, a relic of a gold rush-era Ballarat. The metamorphosis of this place into a beautiful spot proved to be a harder task than the couple thought. While Bower, Purcell, and another couple of owners, Sasha Semjonov and Tessa Dunstan, did get the permit for building two townhouses on the vacant land, the economic outlook, including inflation and interests running high, proved these plans to be not suitable. They realized that they shouldn’t spend their money on materials and labor, and instead, they were better off selling t he block. Why did they sell it for Bitcoin? Purcell and Bower provided a simple explanation of why they wanted to sell the land for Bitcoin, not for fiat money. The main reason is to reduce the middleman costs. Instead of losing time and money on estate agents and bank operations, they want a quick and safe transaction that won’t cost much, and Bitcoin is the way to go. The block was sold. According to the vendors, everything took one hour, with no inspection or staging taking place. Bower said that today, social media platforms play a huge role in selling estate and pointed out TikTok as an example. Do people often pay for real estate in crypto? The Ballarat land trade turned heads, but we can’t say that Australians were the only ones to sell the estate for Bitcoin. Another notable case is the $22 million penthouse in Miami sold for cryptocurrency in 2021. At the time, it was considered the biggest real estate deal made via cryptocurrency. Even though Bitcoin is not even a legal tender anywhere but in El Salvador, more and more people around the world use crypto to pay for real estate. If we factor in people who pay in fiat money but use blockchain to keep the real estate records, we will find out even more cases. For instance, the Republic of Georgia uses blockchain to maintain property registers on the national level. Many choose crypto to pay for property because it allows them to save money on intermediaries and lifts the barriers associated with cross-border transactions. Interestingly, some people buy real estate for fiat money, but they accumulate the necessary amounts through investment in crypto. The Fairway study revealed that in the fourth quarter of 2021 nearly 12% of all first-time homebuyers used the money they made via selling their crypto holdings. This shift illustrates how vital cryptocurrency became in the 2020s and how influential it is for the real estate market, even if the deals themselves take place off-chain for fiat money. The other report says that crypto is fueling the 2020s real estate boom in the United States. Not to mention, some people sell their houses to invest in Bitcoin. The crazy fact is that real estate becomes increasingly cheap if we evaluate it in Bitcoin rather than fiat money, as the BTC price has been growing faster than the real estate prices in USD. Real estate investing is a gamble but most people don't want to admit it I don't care how great the location is You buy houses because you expect the price to go up Bitcoin adoption will lead to deflation On a Bitcoin standard, real estate investing makes no sense, no matter… pic.twitter.com/V2NEh6qTFO — Rajat Soni, CFA (@rajatsonifnance) January 11, 2025 Blockchain and the real estate sector Since the release of Ethereum whitepaper, blockchain has become a tool shaping the new reality. Any sector that involves data can benefit from blockchain. What’s more important is that blockchain does not make life easier for only one party involved. The best projects create a win-win balance. Probably, the middlemen are the only category that gets cut off. The real estate market is one of the biggest markets in the world. Not only do we use real estate for life and work, but we also see real estate as an investment. That’s why this sector couldn’t go unnoticed by blockchain entrepreneurs. Moreover, real estate is notorious for savage intermediary fees and cumbersome bureaucracy. Looks like a job for a blockchain dApp! The real estate deals with the ownership rights. Blockchain gives owners an easy tool to trade their estate without having to deal with such traditional entities as banks, agents, and so on. The trade is done through smart contracts embedded in the local legal space to ensure that the ownership will be passed to a buyer as soon as the payment takes place. As smart contracts are automatic, they don’t take agent fees. Blockchain eliminates time-consuming, exhausting paperwork, allowing counterparts to trade property quickly as soon as they agree on the conditions. No bank or other entity can intervene and delay the process. The ownership is verified, and buyers can access all the necessary legal information about the estate they are going to buy. Through the tokenization of real estate, owners may sell fractions of their property in the form of digital tokens. This trend democratizes real estate trading.

In general, it’s safe to say that real estate gradually embraces crypto just like the other sectors do. Although some consider crypto price volatility to be a hurdle for the adoption of crypto as real estate money, others seek fortune, hoping the crypto they get in exchange for a house will rise in value in the future.

Once a popular choice among investors, the token’s steep decline followed Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration, which initially raised hopes of a market boost. Whale Activity Shakes Confidence Whale activity has played a major role in the token’s price crash. According to Lookonchain data, two major transactions were recorded, including a sale by a whale named Ansem, who offloaded 194,799 TRUMP tokens worth $6.83 million, incurring a $2.55 million loss.

Broader Meme Coin Market Suffers The sell-off has rippled through the broader meme coin market. Solana-based tokens like MELANIA, BONK, and WIF have suffered substantial losses, with MELANIA down 62.7%, BONK losing 1.7%, and WIF dropping 5.4%. Allegations of a pump-and-dump scheme involving Cuba, which reportedly rug-pulled $158 million, have added to investor concerns. Despite the downturn, some analysts see potential buying opportunities. Platforms like Coingecko have flagged BONK and WIF as promising investments, with similar sentiment emerging for TRUMP. However, the token’s future depends heavily on investor confidence and possible executive orders from President Trump, who has hinted at crypto-friendly reforms. In the meanwhile, Coinbase listing of TRUMP has also created a buying opportunity for Trump’s coin. Analysts Warns of Risks I was like…ok…I wouldn’t have done this memecoin…but how could they make the best of this, and mitigate the crash? And then they launch a second memecoin, crashing the value themselves.

While acknowledging the community-driven success of some meme coins, Srinivasan stressed that the best tokens are those with real-world value. Joining the fray, Mark Cuban, a Big Crypto Investor has also critized TRUMP memecoin calling it a self-serving project with no real world use. Mint it, Print it, Sell it Fuck it.

The fee record surpassed previous periods of peak trading activity. Peak trading activity for Official Trump (TRUMP) increased bribes and fees to validators above 100K SOL over two days of active trading. Validators marked a peak both in terms of SOL inflows and a record number of bundles and posting wallets. Peak trading happened on January 20, when validators received more than 87K SOL. The exceptional activity was mostly tied to the TRUMP token rally. The asset took a step back, sliding to $40.12, after peaking above $70. A total of 24.7M bundles were sent out to guarantee transaction success. While base SOL sending fees remained low, interacting with some apps incurred much higher expenses. A total of 1.5M unique tippers paid out the fees, out of a total 4.5M Solana daily active users. Peak tippers underscored the interest in TRUMP and related tokens, for sniping and early swaps on Meteora and Orca. Validators worked overtime to post transactions to the main chain, especially during temporary outages of some Solana services. Helius Labs, Solayer, and JitoSOL, managed to ensure access for experienced traders. However, not all transactions went through, leading to competitive posting and record-high fees. Jito received SOL both as a validator and as a MEV service, rising to about 10% of total fees. Solana itself has not posted a status for being offline or having problem with its consensus. During the early hours of TRUMP and MELANIA launches, transactions were still highly competitive, using bots and sniping techniques. Users that tried to go through Coinbase saw their SOL transactions pending for hours. Solana grows its real economic value The fees and tips on Solana are the chain’s real economic value, showing the real demand of users. Meme token demand, whether for Pump.fun tokens or other launches, reveals the preferences of real users and the chain’s leading application. On Solana, block building does not include sandwich attacks or other forms of sniping, meaning all tip payers are traders interested in the potential of the latest tokens. MEV activity is seen as positive for Solana and one of the big incentives to validators. Solana’s economic value rose as tips were necessary to achieve decentralized swaps for TRUMP and other tokens. | Source: Blockworks The real economic value showed base fees were a negligible source of income, and no voting transactions were handled in the past few days. However, the bulk of activity came from Jito tips and priority fees. Solana’s period of exceptional economic activity also affected stakers and holders, where annualized passive income can rise to 7.14%, while inflation is under 5%. The latest meme trading peak also caused record SOL burns, balancing the slightly higher new issuance and fees. Solana also showed it could handle much higher traffic compared to Ethereum, though still reaching the limit of its services. In the past 24 hours, Solana still produced more than 35M in fees . Meteora also shot forward as the new venue for meme tokens, gaining more than $59M in fees. The entire Solana ecosystem took part in the latest drive to snipe the latest tokens. The MEVX and Trojan bots were among the biggest fee producers, as bot activity reached peak levels. Phantom wallet lined up among the top 10 fee producers, despite a brief overload period. SOL open interest slides after the initial frenzy The peak SOL activity did not result in an immediate rally for SOL. Open interest for SOL slid from over $5.1B down to $3.5B. SOL retreated to $233, after peaking above $270. For now, SOL has slowed down and has not fulfilled the expectations of rising to $300. Even days after the launch of TRUMP, Coinbase users complained of delayed SOL transactions. SOL expects to move to a higher price range, as its activity habitually surpasses that of Ethereum. The ease of launching tokens and the growing liquidity might mean Solana is displacing Ethereum as the hub for token activity.

This commitment comes on the heels of Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin’s recent statement on X, where he emphasized the foundation’s plans to embrace organizational changes . The new direction aims to provide greater support to decentralized application developers while fostering community transparency. The allocated funds will be secured using a three-of-five multisig wallet on Safe, ensuring robust security for the initiative.

The foundation’s treasury has seen a considerable decline , dropping by 56% from 617,000 Ether in January 2020 to 269,000 Ether today, as per data from Arkham Intelligence. Despite this, Buterin remains steadfast in prioritizing the network’s long-term growth over immediate financial concerns. However, the announcement has sparked mixed reactions within the Ethereum community. Critics, such as Infinix founder Kain Warwick, have previously accused the Ethereum Foundation of neglecting the DeFi space, while others have raised concerns over the selling pressure created by the foundation to meet its operational costs. To address these concerns, core developer Eric Conner suggested leveraging staking rewards to cover internal budgets and reduce the need for selling Ether. Ethereum Foundation Balancing Vision with Expectations Buterin has clarified that the Ethereum Foundation is not planning an ideological shift or lobbying efforts, emphasizing its commitment to being “credibly neutral.” This approach contrasts with some community sentiments, which blame the foundation’s perceived lack of engagement for Ether’s lagging price performance relative to competitors like Bitcoin and Solana. Nonetheless, the foundation’s decision to allocate substantial resources to DeFi has garnered support from figures like CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, who praised Buterin for prioritizing innovation over profit.

Notably, the crypto exchange on Tuesday revealed that it is adding the TRUMP USD-Margined perpetual contract to its futures copy trading division, alongside new listings for seven other assets. In response, traders and investors remain bullish regarding the future price action of these tokens, primarily as their market exposure increases with new listings on leading cryptocurrency exchanges. Binance Unveils Futures Listing For TRUMP & 7 Other Crypto Assets According to an official Binance announcement dated January 21, the crypto exchange giant is adding 8 USD-Margined perpetual contracts to its futures copy trading division at 08:00 UTC. Notably, per the announcement, the crypto exchange is adding TRUMPUSDT, ARCUSDT, AVAAIUSDT, DEXEUSDT, HIVEUSDT, PROMUSDT, SOLVUSDT, and SONICUSDT perpetual contracts for users, allowing them to copy experienced traders’ portfolios in real-time. As a result, market sentiments surrounding these tokens have turned highly optimistic. The bullish anticipation comes as crypto enthusiasts expect a gush of money inflow into these assets as investors continue to gauge opportunities that maximize gains, as in with Binance copy trading. Also, it’s noteworthy that the same exchange revealed another vital update on the new TRUMP token. Notably, the platform’s spot trading division has commenced trading for the asset pegged to TRY starting on the same date and time. Overall, the enhanced trade offerings continue to project market optimism surrounding the new meme coin on Solana, boosting market visibility. Bithumb Joins The Fray Amid Major Listings Simultaneously, a leading S. Korean cryptocurrency exchange has recently revealed an update on the TRUMP coin, expanding market support for the asset. As per a Bithumb announcement, the crypto exchange is adding the new Solana meme coin to the Won market. This listing has further cemented the broader market’s optimism on the token, coming alongside the abovementioned listings on Binance. Meanwhile, CoinGape reported that even Coinbase expanded support for the TRUMP token. Whilst leading exchanges offer support to the new crypto project, it’s also worth mentioning that Republican Donald Trump concluded his presidential inauguration on Monday. The new meme coin has emerged as the talk of the crypto town, primarily in light of this saga, supported by previous price gains. How Is The Meme Coin Currently Delivering? At the time of reporting, TRUMP price crashed nearly 31% intraday and is trading at $40.31. Its 24-hour low and high were $31.01 and $61.12, respectively. Despite soaring optimism in light of major listings on Binance, Coinbase, and Bithumb, the token’s waning movement has raised severe investor concerns. Nevertheless, CoinGape recently reported that the meme coin is likely gearing up for a rally to $54, as spotlighted by a leading crypto market analyst. Notably, analyst Ali Martinez claims that the technical patterns hint at a bullish breakout looming for the token.

This review highlights the platform’s outstanding achievements in terms of key metrics, wealth-generation capabilities, and ecosystem advancements. Strong Asset Performance Fuels HTX’s Stellar 2024 In 2024, HTX achieved a total trading volume of approximately $2.4 trillion, marking an impressive 100% year-on-year growth. Spot trades of approximately 62% of this volume, reaching$1.5 trillion, increased by 160%, and futures trades reached $900 billion, increased by 70%. Overall, trading volumes climbed steadily throughout the year. In 2024, HTX listed 218 spot assets across trending sectors like DePIN, RWA, meme coins, and SunPump, including 171 exclusive first-to-market launches. For futures trading, more than 80 assets were added to the platform, with nearly 70, or over 90%, experiencing gains exceeding 200%. By the end of 2024, HTX supported over 160 futures trading assets, providing users with a diverse range of trading options. Furthermore, HTX Earn has covered 166 mainstream cryptos with 2,725 listed projects and served more than 500,000 users with managed funds exceeding $1 billion. 2024 also saw explosive user growth. As of the end of 2024, HTX boasted a user base of more than 49 million , with nearly 80 billion visits on its website and app. Notably, the percentage of active users surged significantly, demonstrating HTX’s ability to foster engagement and trust. As a world-leading digital asset trading platform, HTX has consistently attracted users worldwide, further solidifying its prominent position. A Year of Explosive Wealth Growth: One High-Potential Project Each Month HTX’s wealth-generation prowess comes from its diverse asset offerings, rapid new listings, and robust innovation capabilities. HTX DAO’s governance token, $HTX, for example, experienced extraordinary growth, soaring from $0.0000008 in early 2024 to a record high of $0.000003596, representing an increase of 350%. Currently traded at $0.0000023, the token achieved an average gain of nearly threefold. Additionally, $22.47 million worth of $HTX tokens were burned in Q4 2024, bolstering ecosystem stability and further driving $HTX’s market value. HTX also launched memecoins that played a pivotal role in creating wealth opportunities. In 2024, with a keen eye on market developments and a focus on precise asset selection, the platform delivered substantial returns by focusing on trending sectors and emerging ecosystems like memecoins, AI, RWA, and SunPump. Each month, at least one promising token was listed, generating extraordinary gains: January: WIF surged 1,987%, riding the Solana meme trend. February: ONDO, launched as a joint decentralized governance project with Flux Finance, grew 740%. March: BOME climbed 300%, quickly becoming a market favorite. April: ENA, centered on synthetic US dollars, rose 637%. May: MAGA, fueled by Trump-related election buzz, soared 1,995%. June: IO, focusing on decentralized DePIN computation, increased 117%. July: FIGHT gained 152% by leveraging political narratives. August: SUNDOG became a standout in TRON’s SunPump ecosystem, skyrocketing 3,700%. September: NEIROCTO, backed by the Neiro community, exploded by 7,281%. October: FARTCOIN surged an astounding 16,000% by combining the concepts of AI and memecoins. November: PNUT, inspired by Elon Musk’s political themes, rose 733%. December: VIRTUAL made steady gains in the AI and metaverse infrastructure sector, increasing 104%. By consistently uncovering promising assets, HTX has outperformed in wealth creation throughout the year. Its ability to swiftly spot top-tier cryptos has provided users with exceptional returns. Simply by keeping an eye on HTX’s newly listed assets, users can be confident that they won’t miss out on any lucrative opportunities. It’s worth noting that HTX further enriched its offerings with financial derivatives and engaging events, including SmartEarn with 14% APY during the Lunar New Year, Launchpool with multiple rewards for single investments, and Flexible Crypto Loans with dynamic interest rates, to cater to the diverse needs of investors. These initiatives empowered users to achieve higher returns while managing risks effectively, further enhancing their asset growth potential. The Logic Behind HTX’s New Asset Listings: A Focus on Long-Term Ecosystem Growth HTX’s rationale of listing new assets extends beyond merely capitalizing on market trends or popular tokens. It reflects the platform’s strategic vision for emerging sectors. For example, in rapidly evolving fields such as AI, HTX has quickly introduced related assets, demonstrating its focus on technological advancements and its foresight regarding market shifts. This approach not only drives innovation within the industry but also solidifies HTX’s position as a leader in blockchain and related sectors. Additionally, HTX has responded to the needs of its community by continually striving to offer a diverse array of investment options and enrich users’ asset portfolios. Furthermore, through new asset launches, the platform has contributed to a healthier blockchain industry and the flourishing of blockchain ecosystems. It not only provides a platform for innovative projects to thrive but also collaborates with these initiatives to accelerate industry maturity and foster prosperity. Moving forward, HTX will continue to support emerging projects with resources to help them gain more attention and access to growth opportunities. In this way, HTX can revitalize its own ecosystem while offering steadfast support for global blockchain innovation, driving long-term industry progress. Consider the example of the SunPump ecosystem. Recognizing a market recovery in Q3 2024, HTX acted swiftly to support SunPump by being the first to list its eight tokens, including SUNDOG, SUNCAT, SUNWUKONG, FOFAR, TRONBULL, TBULL, MUNCAT, and IVFUN. This early move provided HTX with a significant market advantage. Among these, SUNDOG stood out with an extraordinary 37x increase following its listing, becoming the flagship project within the SunPump ecosystem. HTX’s comprehensive effort provided a powerful boost to SunPump while also affording users lucrative opportunities to share in on-chain rewards. Moreover, Justin Sun, Global Advisor of HTX, has made substantial contributions to the growth of SunPump. He facilitated a reduction in gas fees for trading memecoins on TRON and fostered key ecosystem partnerships, such as a 98% reduction in transaction fees for trading memecoins on TRON through OKX Wallet. These efforts significantly improved the user experience and boosted both user engagement and participation, further invigorating the SunPump ecosystem. Ecosystem development necessitates both strategic insight and long-term planning. As Justin Sun remarked on social media, “In the future, AI will play a crucial role in resource allocation, financial decision-making, and other key areas, enhancing efficiency across industries and driving smarter, more transparent, and fairer business models.” With a deep understanding of the AI ecosystem, HTX recognizes the technology as a pivotal force in driving innovation and solving complex problems. As we move into an era increasingly dominated by AI agents, HTX is proactively embracing this transformation by combining AI technology with blockchain. This integration will facilitate intelligent evolutions within ecosystems, creating greater value for both users and the industry. Leading the Charge: Fast, Accurate Asset Listings for a Win-Win “People’s Exchange” HTX distinguishes itself among major exchanges with its efficiency in asset listings, wealth generation, and community engagement, consistently maintaining a keen awareness of market trends and emerging opportunities. Prior to most competitors, the platform discovered and introduced premium projects like WIF, MYRO, BOME, NEIROCTO, and ACTSOL, witnessing their rise and success alongside community members and enabling users to capture early-stage profits. Notably, WIF and MYRO served as catalysts for the Solana meme bull market. HTX, with its acute market awareness, swiftly identified this trend and launched Solana-based meme assets to empower investors. This early action yielded significant results: for example, WIF surged by 19x following its listing, sparking widespread excitement within the community. According to official announcements and data, BOME, NEIROCTO, WIF, TURBO, and ACTSOL all made their debut on HTX prior to other major exchanges, granting the platform a first-mover advantage. As a result, HTX demonstrated superior opening performance. For instance, BOME opened at 0.0005 USDT on HTX , compared to 0.0073 USDT on Binance (a 14.6x difference). Similarly, WIF opened on HTX at 0.04 USDT, 25x lower than its opening price on Binance. TURBO exhibited an even more striking contrast, with an opening price of 0.0006 USDT on HTX versus 0.03 USDT on Binance (a 50x difference). Thanks to its early listings and more competitive initial pricing, HTX provided users with greater investment potential and enhanced their opportunities for significant returns. Another example of HTX’s asset selection prowess is the early listing of NEIROCTO and ACTSOL. Despite their relatively low initial prices, HTX chose to launch these tokens and maintained close ties with community members, consistently supporting and collaborating with them. As these projects gained market momentum and were listed on Binance, they experienced explosive growth, creating valuable wealth opportunities for HTX users. By listing these tokens at an early stage, HTX allowed users to enter at a lower price. As these tokens garnered wider market recognition, they often attracted increased attention and trading volume, driving their prices up. This strategy underscores HTX’s core strength as a premier platform for quality assets: “Spot Early, List Early.” This provides users with access to high-potential early investment opportunities. For those seeking emerging projects and aiming for high returns, HTX’s first-mover advantage and low initial prices can be the key to unlocking substantial profits. Looking Ahead to 2025: Listening to Users and Creating a New Era of Wealth In 2024, HTX’s asset performance demonstrated the potential of a digital asset platform to generate substantial wealth for its users through innovation and services. From the impressive price surges of newly listed assets to extensive participation in community events, HTX has successfully established itself as a premier platform for wealth creation. User feedback provides the clearest evidence of HTX’s impact on wealth creation. On social media, numerous users have shared their experiences of achieving financial growth by engaging with HTX’s new assets, expressing their appreciation for the platform’s careful asset selection. One user commented, “Despite facing widespread skepticism, HTX has evolved from a small exchange into a top-tier platform that leads the industry. I hope the HTX team continues to uncover more premium projects to reward the community!” As 2025 unfolds, HTX will collaborate with users to embrace the next wave of wealth creation through sharper market insights, refined asset selection, and continuous community development. Initially, HTX will continue to expand its asset categories by incorporating more high-potential cryptos to broaden wealth opportunities for users. The platform will also foster industry growth by actively seeking projects with long-term value for the crypto industry and providing them with more resources for collaborative industry development. More importantly, HTX will remain committed to its community, actively engaging with users, prioritizing their needs, attentively listening to community feedback, opposing conspiracy tokens, and striving to build the platform into the “People’s Exchange.” In 2025, a year brimming with opportunities and challenges, HTX will maintain its focus on trending sectors and emerging assets with a user-centric approach. The platform will work more closely within the broader industry ecosystem, lead the industry through multi-dimensional innovations, and co-create a new chapter of crypto wealth with users worldwide. Let’s anticipate the remarkable legacy of wealth creation that HTX will build in 2025!

Bitcoin and Solana are top picks for this cycle, with Coinbase and Robinhood as key equities benefiting from crypto adoption. The era of tokenized capital is here, and those who position themselves early can benefit greatly from the reshaping of capital markets and capital formation. Since the evening of 17 January 2025, social media has been abuzz with the news of a high-profile memecoin tied to President Donald Trump. The ticker is TRUMP . The token was launched at the time of a “ Crypto Ball ” celebrating the inauguration of President Trump, who is dubbed as “the first crypto president” thanks to his expressed support for the industry on the campaign trail. This is a highly unprecedented move from a former and incoming POTUS. What makes this situation more amusing is that the token launch happened just a few hours after Gary Gensler, officially departed from his position as Chair of the SEC. Gensler has been widely viewed as antagonistic towards crypto over the course of his administration. The criticism on social media amongst crypto circles over this token launch has been quite severe, even as the token price has performed extremely well. TRUMP went up to over a $70 billion fully diluted valuation. Then on 19 January, the MELANIA token was launched (a memecoin of former and incoming First Lady Melania Trump). MELANIA has reached a $11 billion FDV. I believe these actions by an incoming POTUS speaks volumes about the outlook of the crypto industry and the capital markets. This article is about breaking down the implications. Here’s the short version: Trump has legitimized token-based capital formation, possibly opening the floodgates for legitimate small businesses and entrepreneurs. Not only could this be the start of possibly the strongest bull market crypto has ever seen, but it also highlights that the procedure of capital formation is likely changing right before our eyes. This second point is, in my view, far more important than a crypto bull market. Launching a token is objectively a more efficient way of raising capital (as I will show ahead), and this method just received the greenlight from the most powerful politician in the world. If you are involved in capital markets in any way at all, you probably should pay close attention to what is happening. The Historical Challenge of Capital Formation For years, small businesses and entrepreneurs have faced significant barriers to raising capital. Traditional capital markets are riddled with high costs, complex regulations, and bureaucratic gatekeeping, making it highly costly for smaller entities to access funding. Public companies enjoy a lower cost of capital, partly because they have the scale to afford all the regulatory overhead required to become listed in public markets. In contrast, small businesses are often left out, even if they have honest intentions and viable business models. Crypto promised to democratize this process by enabling anyone to launch a token, but that promise has largely fallen short. Unfortunately, the core reason for this was the lack of regulatory clarity. Any honest business or entrepreneur who wanted to use crypto rails for capital formation was taking on a massive risk. As a result, crypto has proliferated with scams and speculative projects. The only real use cases in crypto have been facilitating the speculation of tokens (effectively serving as a casino). This situation has been the norm over the last 6 years. Trump’s Memecoin: Possibly Legitimizing Crypto As A Fundraising Tool Trump’s memecoin is a black swan event which breaks the current pattern. By leveraging his status and influence, Trump has demonstrated that tokens are a legitimate option, and can potentially be used to bypass the high hurdles of traditional capital markets. More importantly, he is signaling with his own action that the U.S. will become much more crypto-friendly. Now, I want to make it clear that this is not any kind of recommendation to buy Trump’s memecoin. What I am highlighting is that if the president can do this just days before taking office, then it literally opens the floodgates for anyone to do it. And perception is rapidly shifting towards the view that crypto is about to undergo a Renaissance moment with American de-regulation and adoption. Trump’s involvement gives credibility and official approval to the concept, signaling to entrepreneurs and small businesses that crypto tokens can be used for real-world applications. For instance: A bakery could launch a token, using profits to buy and burn the token, creating value for token holders via a deflationary token supply. This would be financially equivalent to a stock buyback. A farm could issue a token where staking yields are tied to agricultural profits. This would be financially equivalent to issuing dividends. Tokens can easily be tied to real-world cash flows of real-world business, moving beyond the speculation-driven business models that currently dominate crypto. With Trump paving the way, we could see an influx of businesses and entrepreneurs utilizing token-based models to accelerate the capital formation process. Why Tokens Are More Efficient Tokens offer unparalleled efficiency compared to traditional methods of raising funds. First and foremost, tokens eliminate the need for cumbersome intermediaries like investment banks, underwriters, and extensive legal teams, significantly reducing the cost and complexity of launching a capital asset. Unlike traditional fundraising mechanisms, which often require months of preparation and compliance with layers of regulatory hurdles, tokens can be issued and traded almost instantly, democratizing access to capital markets. Anyone can launch a token by paying less than $5 in blockchain network fees. Additionally, tokens enable better flexibility. They can be programmed with smart contracts to automate processes such as dividend distribution, buybacks, or staking rewards, reducing administrative overhead and enhancing transparency. Token holders can directly and immediately participate in the issuer's success, fostering a stronger alignment of incentives between businesses and their investors. Another advantage is that tokens can be traded 24/7 on globally accessible platforms. This creates better access and price discovery. Moreover, the total supply, all the holders and their respective transactions are all visible at all times on the public blockchain. When you tally it all up, launching a token is a more efficient method of capital formation in every conceivable objective metric of capital formation: Speed of execution Frequency, if there is a need to do it multiple times Cost to launch compared to value received from a launch Transparency of supply, holders, transactions Price discovery Accessibility If honest businesses aren't barred from tapping this avenue, then it absolutely helps them. And so far, honest businesses have been barred from tapping this avenue of capital formation because of regulatory uncertainty and hostility. Trump has arguably single-handedly reversed this dynamic. Now, I do want to make it clear that in order for this market to be fair and efficient, there does have to be trust in any business that is attempting a launch. Even though launching a token is very simple, procuring the documents for potential investors to review is harder. In the case of tokens, there may be less regulatory oversight and this allows people to conduct a capital markets transaction in a more peer-to-peer manner. A business can release the records they have and the plans they have. They can utilize Twitter spaces and social media to speak directly to the public, and interested individuals can invest in the token that was launched, or raise inquiries in the same public forums. In other words, the due diligence and transparency process is transferred from regulatory agencies like the SEC onto market participants. People can approach a token investment based on the risk tolerance they prefer and the due diligence they conduct. Businesses can raise capital in much smaller amounts at much faster speeds, and they need not worry about meeting the high bars set by regulators and regulated exchanges (which also includes very high fees to apply or list their securities). If an entrepreneur is able to quickly procure the things needed to convince his investors, he no longer needs to worry about filling hundreds of pages of forms for regulators and exchanges, and paying massive fees to attorneys in the process. He can simply identify his investor set and launch a token, while upholding his end of the bargain to accrue value to the token once his business starts becoming profitable. To the government, this is also arguably a much more preferable option. Regulatory offices cost a lot of taxpayer money. If people want to launch tokens for their businesses and others want to invest in the token, then it makes sense to just let everyone do what they want to do with their own money and time, save on all the expense of having a lot of regulators, and then come back to collect tax revenue once the ventures have succeeded. By lowering the cost to access capital and by bypassing traditional gatekeepers, crypto can create a freer, more efficient market where honest businesses thrive, and bad actors are increasingly identified and ignored. This shift could mark the beginning of a new chapter for crypto, where the focus moves from speculation to real-world utility. It would also mark the start of a monumental change in how smaller enterprises can access capital markets. Picks for This Cycle As token-based capital formation gains traction, the broader crypto market is likely to experience significant growth. However, not all cryptocurrencies are positioned to benefit equally. I believe Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and Solana (SOL-USD) are the best crypto picks. Coinbase ( COIN ) and Robinhood ( HOOD ) are the equities that can benefit disproportionately from this trend. Bitcoin Bitcoin remains the ultimate decentralized digital commodity. As token-based fundraising grows, BTC’s role as the reserve asset of crypto is likely to strengthen. Institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, and its integration into traditional finance further solidify its position as a must-have asset for long-term investors seeking exposure to crypto. The importance of BTC really cannot be understated. I view it as far bigger than the rest of crypto because it has the potential to become a global monetary asset. The use of BTC as a reserve asset in corporate treasures is also a trend that is continuing. More companies are adding BTC to balance sheets and this trend is very likely to accelerate now that institutional acceptance of BTC via ETFs, options, futures, and FASB accounting treatment of digital assets. So the best way by far to play this crypto cycle is to simply own BTC. Solana Solana is emerging as the chain of choice for token launches, including the TRUMP and MELANIA memecoins. Solana has fast transaction speeds and low fees. Total value locked on the chain has continued to climb and is gaining market share from the other chains. TVL (Defillam) Solana has become a hotbed for memecoin activity, and its infrastructure supports businesses looking to launch tokens efficiently and affordably. These flows accrue value to the SOL token because SOL is used to pay for all blockchain network fees on Solana. Also, in the major token launchpads on Solana, SOL is the asset that is used to trade against the newly launched tokens. In other words, rather than XYZ-USD, the pair will be XYZ-SOL. In contrast, Ethereum (ETH-USD) is somewhat losing ground. Higher gas fees and network congestion make it less appealing for the next wave of token-based capital formation. Ethereum faces the larger question of L2’s becoming cannibalistic to blockspace and therefore not actually accruing value to the ETH token. Without getting into weeds on this, the bottom line is that there is likely more upside in SOL than in ETH. After TRUMP was launched on Solana, ETH actually lost value and the SOL-ETH pair traded much higher and the BTC-ETH pair reached a low that it hadn’t reached in years. It really seems like people are becoming increasingly bearish on ETH and viewing Solana as the chain where things will happen. I expect that SOL will flip ETH in market cap within the next 2 years. Coinbase and Robinhood Both COIN and HOOD are pick and shovels equities plays for crypto adoption. I was quite surprised that Robinhood moved so fast in listing TRUMP. While initial token launches can only be purchased by participating on-chain with a crypto wallet, as the tokens get larger they eventually get listed on crypto exchanges. COIN and HOOD can make a lot of money here. To get the assets to fund a crypto wallet, a user generally needs to buy it from a venue like COIN and HOOD. If a user wants to trade tokens without a crypto wallet, then they can just trade it natively in the Coinbase or Robinhood app. It’s easy to see that these two stocks could benefit from a crypto-friendly U.S. regulatory climate. Risks There is a chance that Trump’s memecoin launch has emboldened scammers without providing confidence to honest businesses. In this case, we could see a proliferation of scams, and this would be bad for the industry. Despite Trump’s high-profile involvement and signaled support, regulatory uncertainty in other jurisdictions remains a possible challenge. Crypto is global, so government crackdowns on token launches could hinder price performance. In the long term, it is safe to say that most other larger developed economies tend to follow the U.S. lead. I think another market risk that needs to be discussed is the risk to public equities. This development is so new and rapidly moving that it is tough to make a decisive call on what will happen. Directionally, I believe it is somewhat bearish for smaller cap stocks in more “innovative” sectors like tech and consumer discretionary. If tokens truly unlock unprecedented capital formation opportunities for smaller businesses, then it would mean that some attention and capital is pulled out of public markets and into crypto. This could be a long-term headwind for small and micro caps. Being publicly traded, these companies cannot move as quickly as to launch their own tokens to benefit from this trend. The best they can feasibly do is to adopt a BTC treasury. The Bottom Line Token-based capital formation is likely coming. By breaking regulatory taboos and legitimizing the use of tokens, Trump has opened the door for businesses to raise capital using far more efficient rails. This shift could catalyze a new wave of crypto adoption, creating opportunities for investors and businesses alike. For those looking to capitalize on this trend, BTC, SOL, COIN, and HOOD stand out to me as top picks, though I think focusing on BTC is the best choice. These assets are poised to lead the way, offering exposure to adoption, de-regulation, and innovation. If the era of tokenized capital is here, then those who position themselves early can stand to benefit greatly from the reshaping of capital markets and capital formation.",BTC-USD|ETH-USD|SOL-USD|IWM|DOGE-USD,EN,0,0,MARKET|SOL|BUSINESS|BTC|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-01-21 10:00:50

Good or Bad for Bitcoin?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/what-does-it-mean-for-donald-trump-and-melania-trump-to-issue-their-own-memecoin-good-or-bad-for-bitcoin/,"Bitcoin (BTC) rose to an all-time high of $109,350.72 earlier today before falling sharply during a volatile trading day coinciding with the inauguration of President Donald Trump. While price action mirrors a classic “buy the rumor, sell the news” scenario, optimism was fueled last week by speculation that Trump could prioritize cryptocurrencies early in his administration. Rumors suggested potential announcements of a crypto advisory council and even the establishment of a U.S. Bitcoin reserve, adding to the bullish sentiment. In addition to the weekend action, Trump launched the “Official Trump” memecoin, which quickly reached a market value of $10 billion, according to CoinGecko. First Lady Melania Trump also launched her own “Melania” memecoin, which reached a trading volume of $7.2 billion the other day. Gracy Chen, CEO of crypto exchange Bitget, said the rally in Bitcoin was driven by policy speculation rather than the launch of memecoins. “Without the launch of Trump family tokens, the price of Bitcoin would have increased more. Instead, capital flowed into new coins, limiting overall growth,” he said.

Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX, suggested that the launch of these tokens signals an open-minded approach to crypto. “Approving memecoins, the wildest crypto assets, is a way for the administration to show how supportive it can be of crypto adoption and position the U.S. as a leader in this space,” Kruger said. Economist and author of the Crypto is Macro Now newsletter Noelle Acheson echoed this view, calling the memecoin launches a “net positive effect” and a sign that Trump supports “new ideas and new markets.” Bitcoin’s rally cooled on Monday, but analysts see more upside potential. Kruger noted that the new high opens the door for a possible extension to $130,000 if the market remains optimistic about crypto-friendly policies. *This is not investment advice.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Binance Coin, Solana, and Rollblock are set to deliver significant returns in January, with Rollblock’s presale raising $9 million and showing 50x potential for 2025. Table of Contents Rollblock takes steps toward gaming dominance in Q1 Binance Coin ready for a four-figure price tag Solana, the chain of choice for President Trump Rollblock delivering on GambleFi promise Binance Coin, Solana, and Rollblock (RBLK) are poised to deliver significant returns in January, as 2025 shapes up to be a fantastic year for altcoins. While experts predict bullish action for Binance Coin and Solana, many believe that Rollblock will outperform the entire market with 50x potential as its highly popular presale offering hits new all-time highs and closes in on $9 million raised. Rollblock takes steps toward gaming dominance in Q1 Rollblock is a new type of GambleFi protocol that leverages the immutable Ethereum blockchain to provide gamers with a verifiable record of all transactions, stamping out any risk of bet fixing. This is a game-changer for an industry that has seen years of criminal activity with no comeback for everyday gamers until now. The Rollblock offering is truly exceptional and consists of over 7,000 casino classics, from poker to roulette, and huge numbers of slot machines. A brand-new sports betting league has also recently been rolled out to huge success and helped to deliver more than $1.75 million in wagered bets last month . Every Rollblock game is powered by the latest AI technology and features immersive live dealer modes that perfectly recreate the buzz of a real-life brick-and-mortar casino. Rollblock is fully crypto-native and accepts deposits in more than 20 different cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Solana, and Tether (USDT). The RBLK token has a deflationary supply thanks to its profit-sharing mechanism, which takes up to 30% of casino profits to buy up RBLK, going on to burn 60% of these tokens to reduce the supply and allocating the remaining 40% to staking rewards. With growing scarcity and a rapidly increasing demand, RBLK is set to reprice to the upside in the coming weeks from its current discount of $0.046. Binance Coin ready for a four-figure price tag Binance Coin is currently pushing up against resistance at $700, as it has rallied by 5.5% in the last seven days to hit $697. Binance Coin has now reached a market cap of $100.3 billion and is sitting at number 6 in the CoinMarketCap crypto top 10. 24-hour trading volume surged by 31% in the last few days as the Binance Coin market saw massive inflows. The inauguration of Donald Trump has led many Binance Coin traders to return to the floor, anticipating a coming Q1 pump as a more dovish administration enters the White House. Trump’s presidency should see US exchanges flourish, which could easily send Binance Coin to $1000 in the coming months. Solana, the chain of choice for President Trump Solana has had an incredibly volatile week, hitting a new all-time high of $293 before crashing back to $232. It has since stabilized at $260 after a record-breaking weekend of volume as the incoming president, Donald Trump, launched his TRUMP meme token on the Solana network. Solana is currently up an astonishing 47% over the last seven days. Solana took in record-breaking transaction fees of over $35 million as Trump’s memecoin surged on Friday night. This boosted Solana’s TVL to more than $12 billion, and despite network congestion, Solana handled the volume well, which stress-tested the Solana chain and will likely see Solana dominate the remainder of this cycle. Rollblock delivering on GambleFi promise Rollblock remains the best risk-to-reward ratio for outsized gains in 2025, as Binance Coin and Solana have already attained market caps of hundreds of billions. Rollblock has the momentum to deliver outstanding gains in 2025, and huge numbers of investors are piling into stage 9 before the inevitable price hike in the days to come.

This resulted in massive volatility and price slumps for the market, with BTC dumping from its latest all-time high to $100,000. The altcoins have suffered even more, especially reps of the ever-volatile meme coin sector. BTC’s Nosedive The weekend turned out to be a lot more eventful than many expected due to the launch of two consecutive meme coins by the now First Family. The primary cryptocurrency managed to defend its position and remained relatively still above $103,000. Moreover, it jumped to over $106,000 on Sunday before it plunged hard on Monday morning to just under $100,000. It managed to bounce off almost immediately and shot up to a new all-time high of just under $110,000. Following these already quite painful moves for some over-leveraged traders, more volatility was expected later during the day as all eyes were on the US presidential ceremony. Once that began, BTC tumbled by five grand within minutes to $102,000. It bounced off during the speech but dropped once again as it ended due to the lack of any mentions of crypto whatsoever. The largest digital asset dropped to $100,000 before it added a few grand and now sits above $102,000. Its market capitalization stands at $2.03 trillion, while its dominance over the alts is still at 55.4%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Alts Bleed Out As it typically happens when BTC heads south in a violent fashion, so do the alts. Ethereum, Binance Coin, Chainlink, and Toncoin are among the least declining assets, with price losses of up to 3-4%. In contrast, XRP is down by 6%, AVAX, XLM, and HBAR by around 8%, while SOL, DOGE, and ADA have plunged by up to 10.5%. The biggest daily losers come from the meme coin space, with FARTCOIN dumping by 28% and TRUMP slumping by 27%. The total crypto market cap is down by over $200 billion since yesterday to $3.670 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

According to Martinez, XRP recently broke out of a bull flag pattern—an indication that bullish momentum may continue in the near term. This breakout aligns with strong technical signals pointing to further upward movement. This short-term prediction follows an even more ambitious target shared by the analyst in an earlier post. Martinez had previously highlighted XRP’s breakout from a symmetrical triangle pattern on the monthly chart, a development he views as another bullish indicator. Based on this long-term formation, the analyst predicts XRP could rally as high as $15. Hopes of regulatory clarity Ripple’s ( XRP ) rally could be supported by growing anticipation within the community that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission might drop its appeal against Ripple in which it claimed the company was offering unregistered securities. The XRP community expects that such a scenario is highly possible Under President Donald Trump, who took office yesterday and has nominated pro-crypto Paul Atkins as the replacement for anti-crypto SEC chief Gary Gensler . Proponents are also lining their hopes on the approval of a spot exchange-traded fund listing for XRP, with a Polymarket poll showing a 73% chance of it being approved in 2025. Additionally, rumors that Trump might exempt U.S.-based cryptocurrencies, like XRP, from capital gains tax and possibly include altcoins in a strategic crypto reserve have also gained strength. Platforms like CoinGecko have already published new categories for top U.S-based cryptocurrencies, which has further instilled confidence among traders. Meanwhile, whales have taken an interest, likely due to current optimism around the token. (See below.)

Source: Santiment Further, net outflows for the token from centralized exchanges over the past 2 days, have also surged, meaning more investors were acquiring the token with expectations of future price appreciation. Bullish momentum around XRP is also backed by the broader growth of the Ripple ecosystem, including the launch of its USD-backed stablecoin, RLUSD, which has seen an uptick in adoption. When writing, the stablecoin held a 24-hour trading volume higher than other prominent stablecoins like DAI, TUSD, and PYUSD. Additionally, Ripple-based meme coins have also become some of the best-performing assets in the sector. The native token of the XRPLedger has risen roughly 46% since the beginning of 2025, exchanging hands at $3.05, while its market cap stood at over $175 billion, cementing its place as the third-largest crypto asset by market cap, per data from CoinGecko.

MELANIA Coin Skyrockets: A New Crypto Star with Massive Potential MELANIA coin has taken the crypto world by storm, surging by 53% within just hours of its launch. Starting at $11.36, this new cryptocurrency boasts a total supply of 1 billion coins. Its market capitalization has soared past $1.6 billion, placing it among the top 100 cryptocurrencies. Interestingly, MELANIA coin claims no ties to political campaigns or government bodies. The coin’s distribution plan allocates 35% to the team, 20% to the community, 20% to reserves, 15% to public sales, and 10% to liquidity. To ensure transparency, the project has a full vesting period of 13 months. Investors are already reaping massive profits. According to a post by Lookonchain, one investor used two wallets to buy MELANIA and earned a staggering $47.5 million. With one wallet, they spent 2,100 SOL (worth $560,000) to buy 1.52 million MELANIA coins, later selling them for $11.5 million, making an $11 million profit. In another wallet, they spent 800,000 USDC to buy 3.84 million MELANIA, sold half for $16.45 million, and still hold $20.85 million worth of coins. This explosive growth suggests MELANIA might be an attractive option in the current market cycle. With its transparent approach and strong market entry, MELANIA could be poised to rival other top cryptocurrencies. TRUMP Coin Soars: A Meme Coin Shakes Up the Crypto World A new meme coin called TRUMP launched on Friday and quickly took the crypto market by storm. Introduced by President-elect Donald Trump, the coin’s market value surged to about $9 billion after hitting a peak of over $15 billion early Sunday. The price of $TRUMP skyrocketed by more than 300% by Saturday morning, continuing its rally into Sunday before easing later that day. Hosted on the Solana blockchain, the coin briefly surpassed $75 per token, making it one of the most talked-about assets of the weekend. The initial supply of $TRUMP is limited to 200 million coins, with plans to expand to 1 billion over the next three years. The remaining tokens are owned by the Trump Organization affiliate CIC Digital LLC and Fight Fight Fight LLC. While the coin’s website notes that $TRUMP is not intended as an investment opportunity or connected to any political campaign, its rapid rise highlights the meme coin phenomenon in the current market cycle. Much like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, $TRUMP taps into viral trends and the influence of public figures to gain traction. Its debut reflects the ongoing interest in alternative cryptocurrencies that blend pop culture with blockchain technology. Conclusion Despite MELANIA and TRUMP’s success, XYZVerse’s unique sports-meme mix and huge growth goals could challenge their dominance in the crypto market.

Mark Uyeda, a pro-crypto Republican, has been appointed as the interim chairman of the US regulatory body by newly inducted US President Donald Trump. Importantly, many believe that this change could impact Ripple, which struggled under Gensler. In the last 30 days, XRP has outperformed all the top ten cryptocurrencies, including BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB and DOGE, with a growth of 36%. Gary Gensler’s Resignation Brings Relief to Ripple On the day when Trump defeated Kamala Harris, Gensler announced his decision to resign from his position. As promised, he resigned from the post before the inauguration. Ripple was one of those cryptocurrency companies that confronted serious troubles due to the unsupportive attitude of Gensler against the crypto industry. Many XRP enthusiasts believe that the change could positively impact Ripple’s XRP. Moreover, Mark Uyeda, who has been appointed as the interim chairman of the US SEC by Trump, in the past, strongly criticised the Gensler-run SEC’s repressive approach against the cryptocurrency sector. XRP’s Current Market Performance On November 5, 2024, the price of XRP was around $0.5124. Since then, the market has grown by 505.85%. Between November 5 and 30 alone, the market climbed by 279.85%. On December 1, the market entered a range of $2.0591 and $2.7263. On January 15, with the single-day surge of 18.23%, the XRP market broke above the range. On January 16, the market touched a peak of $3.4021. Right now, the XRP price stands at $3.1013 – at least 9.69% below the aforementioned peak. XRP ETF Approvals and Whale Activity XRP enthusiasts anticipate that the new SEC administration will give approval for the release of XRP ETFs. Reports suggest that crypto whales have purchased at least 100 million XRP in the last 48 hours. Long-Term XRP Predictions Technical analysts point out that XRP has recorded at least 60% green days in the last 30 days, highlighting the existence of a strong bullish trend in the XRP market. Emphasising the future potential of the XRP market, experts forecast that XRP could reach $4.33 by April 2025. In conclusion, Ripple’s journey under a pro-crypto SEC could redefine its future.

While Chainlink and Avalanche grapple with market corrections, this PropFi gem is emerging as a beacon of innovation, offering a fresh perspective on decentralized finance. Here’s a detailed look at what’s fueling this trend! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Tokenization Boost: Will Chainlink Regain Its DeFi Dominance in 2025? Chainlink has seen a challenging start to 2025, with its DeFi coin price dipping to $21 from a December 2024 peak of $30. This decline has raised concerns among investors about the altcoin’s future performance. However, LINK continues to try to regain momentum. Chainlink recently partnered with BTguru . This collaboration is aimed at driving the institutional adoption of tokenized assets in Turkey. This move positions Chainlink to tap into the rapidly growing tokenization market. Industry experts believe this could reignite interest in LINK and potentially push its DeFi coin price closer to its previous highs. Despite the optimism, a growing number of investors are hedging their bets. They are diversifying into newer opportunities, such as the new PropFi coin gaining significant traction within the DeFi space. PropFi vs. Avalanche: Why Investors Are Eyeing New Horizons Avalanche has had a rocky start to 2025. After climbing to $44 at the beginning of January, the AVAX DeFi coin price has fallen back to $35 as of January 16. This decline has raised questions about the token’s short-term momentum. AVAX’s unique Avalanche L1 architecture continues to drive interest among developers and users alike. Its latest integration with 0xgasless further highlights its commitment to innovation. This collaboration aims to improve scalability and efficiency, bolstering Avalanche’s position in the DeFi ecosystem. With this development, market analysts remain optimistic about its recovery, with projections of a climb to $45 for AVAX by February. However, as Avalanche works to regain its footing, some investors are exploring newer opportunities. One such example is the new PropFi coin , which is gaining significant traction in DeFi.

Bitcoin Spot ETFs See Record $1.08 Billion Inflows, Ethereum ETFs Lag Behind Best Performers in Bitcoin Spot ETFs BlackRock ETF (IBIT): $376 million Fidelity ETF (FBTC): $326 million These significant inflows underscore the growing investor confidence in Bitcoin-focused ETFs amid a favorable regulatory environment and increasing mainstream adoption of crypto assets. Ethereum Spot ETFs Show Modest Growth While Ethereum spot ETFs raised less capital, they still recorded a notable total net inflow of $23.87 million on the same day. Fidelity ETF (FETH): $13.99 million BlackRock ETF (ETHA): $7.38 million While Ethereum’s performance reflects its status as a critical component of the decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 ecosystems, it has lagged behind Bitcoin in attracting investor interest. Capital flows into Bitcoin ETFs have significantly outpaced Ethereum, indicating a clear preference for Bitcoin as the primary digital asset for institutional portfolios. Analysts attribute this trend to Bitcoin’s position as a “digital gold” store of value and its broader appeal to traditional investors. Despite its prominent role in DeFi and smart contracts, Ethereum continues to face competition from emerging blockchain platforms and scalability challenges, which may explain the relatively modest ETF inflows. Strong inflows into both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs reflect growing optimism in the cryptocurrency market as a whole, particularly amid an increasingly favorable regulatory environment in the United States and other jurisdictions. *This is not investment advice.

Kenya is mulling a new policy that would require crypto businesses to open local offices, aiming to tighten oversight of the country’s fast-growing virtual asset industry, Bloomberg has learned , citing a draft law on the National Treasury’s website. The proposed law would exclude businesses dealing with assets that can’t be traded, transferred, or used for payments outside a closed system. According to the document, the policy “seeks to close the gaps in the absence of a legal and regulatory framework for virtual assets and virtual asset service providers.” The proposal also aims to address issues like consumer protection, data privacy, and cybersecurity.

Still, the sector lacks clear regulations. If the draft law passes, crypto businesses operating in the country will be required to establish a local presence, giving the government a better way to monitor their activities.

As crypto markets grow more complex, a new wave of AI “agentic” tools is emerging to simplify decision-making. Griffin AI has announced the launch of its Price Analyst, an autonomous agent designed to sift through thousands of crypto assets and provide real-time financial analysis. This new solution aims to help traders and enthusiasts make more informed decisions in a rapidly evolving marketplace. AI Agents: Changing the face of crypto Recent advances in AI agentic workflows are enabling specialized tasks previously handled by teams of analysts. By integrating automation, real-time data, and deep learning, these agents can track Bitcoin, explore altcoins, perform swaps, provide liquidity, and much more — all on behalf of their human users. AIXBT, built on the Solana blockchain, has gained significant attention for offering strategic market insights and automating trend tracking. Similarly, ai16z leverages the open-source Eliza framework for autonomous fund management, illustrating the potential for AI-driven decision-making in decentralized finance (DeFi). Introducing Griffin AI’s Price Analyst Griffin AI’s Price Analyst is positioned amongst a new class of autonomous agents designed to harness AI for real-time market analysis. Leveraging an advanced technical framework that integrates large datasets, rigorous validation steps, and automated charting, the Price Analyst delivers both immediate value to traders and a glimpse into the future of AI agent orchestration. What the Price Analyst delivers for users Here are a few of the most important key features of Griffin AI’s Price Analyst Agent: Comprehensive coverage: Tapping into historical and real-time data on over 2,000 crypto assets, the Price Analyst quickly generates short-, medium-, and long-term projections — helping traders spot emerging trends before the wider market reacts. Time-saving insights: Within minutes, users receive a detailed 6-to-8-page report spanning multiple time horizons. This reduces research and decision-making time from hours to minutes, empowering faster action in volatile markets. Dynamic visualizations & custom dashboards: Interactive charts enable zooming, hovering over data points, and toggling key indicators. Tailored visual outputs bridge the gap between raw data and actionable insights, offering a personalized view of market dynamics. Advanced technical indicators: From MACD and RSI to Bollinger Bands and moving averages, the Price Analyst combines a deep library of signals, automatically interpreting them against current and historical price action. Actionable guidance: By analyzing thousands of data points, charts, and indicators, the agent delivers precise insights — eliminating the need for users to be technical-analysis experts. Technical capabilities under the hood Here is a breakdown of the technical functioning of the Price Analyst. Real-Time data integration: The Price Analyst continuously draws on a large, rapidly updating dataset (over 33 million data entries across all assets, expanding by the hour). This ensures that insights reflect the latest market moves. Automated chart generation & self-analysis: Beyond processing raw numbers, the Price Analyst autonomously plots interactive charts, “visualizing” patterns in the data. It then applies advanced chart-reading logic to interpret trends, support/resistance levels, and volatility shifts. Expert system architecture: Beneath the surface, a specialized rule-based framework replicates the behavior of a seasoned technical analyst. By correlating volume breakouts, moving average crossovers, and other indicators, the agent delivers a coherent, data-backed market narrative. AI validation & cross-referencing: Each step of the agent’s reasoning involves data verification. Inconsistencies trigger reanalysis to ensure conclusions are built on solid technical grounds, addressing the common AI challenge of “hallucinations.” A robust data layer further cross-verifies AI-driven outputs, minimizing misleading recommendations. By uniting these user-focused features with an equally robust technical infrastructure, Griffin AI’s Price Analyst not only delivers immediate value to traders but also highlights the potential of modular AI agent design in the crypto space. “We’re introducing a framework that sets the stage for truly autonomous, blockchain-based AI,” says Oliver Feldmeier, CEO of Griffin AI. “The Price Analyst offers real-time insights for traders, and provides the foundational layer for building more sophisticated, modular agents that can handle complex on-chain tasks independently.” A modular base agent for the future The Price Analyst is far more than an end-user product; it’s also a modular base agent designed for further development. As Griffin AI moves toward its vision of allowing anyone — technical or not — to build their own blockchain-based AI agent, these plug-and-play modules serve as critical building blocks for next-generation DeFi tools. Available Now on Griffin AI Playground Over 230,000 users have already accessed the Griffin AI Playground, engaging with cutting-edge agents like the Price Analyst for testing and training. The platform’s active points program incentivizes user participation, rewarding early adopters for exploring and stress-testing these advanced tools. This vibrant ecosystem demonstrates Griffin AI’s commitment to fostering innovation and user collaboration in shaping the future of AI-driven crypto solutions. Users can explore and stress-test various AI agents in the Griffin AI Playground , earning points and gaining familiarity with the platform. About Griffin AI Griffin AI specializes in integrating artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, creating an innovative platform for the deployment, use, and monetization of decentralized AI agents. Serving individual developers, non-technical creators, and large organizations alike, Griffin AI provides essential tools for the development and monetization of autonomous AI agents within a blockchain environment.

The sentiment during the period was extreme fear, and the industry never thought it would recover. But just over two years later, bitcoin is trading over $100,000 with a new presumably crypto-friendly U.S. administration in charge. Donald Trump is now officially the 47th President of the U.S., however he has yet to announce any crypto policies . One of the many discussions around bitcoin is the four-year cycle analysis, structured around its halving program, which cuts supply every four years. We tend to see similar cycles play out, with huge price appreciation the year after the halving, while this current cycle continues to mirror the previous two cycles. So far, bitcoin is up around 550% from the cycle lows during the FTX collapse (black line). The chart shows that at this point in the current cycle, between the 2015 and 2018 cycles, bitcoin's (blue line) price was also up around a similar amount from the cycle low that occurred on Jan. 14, 2015. It is important to note that Glassnode data takes the closing price of the day at 00:00 UTC, which can differ from other trading platforms. The green line shows that during the 2018 to 2022 cycle, at this point in the cycle BTC was up around 1,300%, over double the gain the token has charted till now. If bitcoin continues to track the 2015 to 2018 cycle, it would finish around 1,100% higher from the cycle low at the end of Q1 2025, putting one bitcoin at $186,000. The peak in the cycle would then occur around October of this year at 11,000% higher, putting a cycle top of around $1.7 million. There are many other ways to compare this with previous cycles, such as comparing it with U.S. presidential administrations. According to a post on X by Bitcoin Archive , bitcoin went up 20x during Donald Trump's first term as president. A return of just 10x would put bitcoin around $1 million from here.",Markets|btc,EN,0,0,BTC|ZRX|TRADING|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-21 11:39:51

ETH’s lackluster price performance comes after President Donald Trump made no crypto-related annoucements during his inaugural address on Monday. Ethereum Price Today: Why is ETH up No data found for ethereum on 33 minutes ago% Ethereum price today hit a daily high of No data found for ethereum on 33 minutes ago and has dropped No data found for ethereum on 33 minutes ago% since then. On January 21, ETH trades at No data found for ethereum on 33 minutes ago as of No data found for ethereum on 33 minutes ago. *Ethereum price updated as of No data found for ethereum on 33 minutes ago. Ethereum Foundation To Explore Staking Options Due to Community Uproar Lately, the Ethereum Foundation has come under massive criticism for selling ETH to fund its day-to-day activities. Coupled with ETH’s lackluster performance in 2024 and 2025, many supporters questioned why the foundation has not considered using Decentralize Finance (DeFi) protocols to borrow or stake nearly $800 million worth of ETH lying in its war chest and why it is considering selling ETH. As a result of the community uproar, the Etheruem Foundation is considering staking their ETH and using the generated revenue for expenses instead of swapping ETH for stablecoins. Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, noted, “We are in the process of large changes to EF leadership structure, which has been ongoing for close to a year. Some of this has already been executed on and made public, and some is still in progress.” Concerning the sale of ETH for stables, Buterin added that one of the goals included increasing, “our use of decentralized and privacy tech and the Ethereum chain, including for payments and treasury management” Ethereum Technical Analysis: Current state of ETH Ethereum price is attempting to reclaim the 21-day composite range, extending from $3,279 to $3,488. This composite value area was created between December 20, 2024, and January 10, 2025. A reclaim of $3,279 will likely propel ETH to the range high of $3,488. The increasing volume and bouncing Relative Strength Index (RSI) show strength and signal the increasing bullish outlook after the Ethereum Foundation accepts its shortcomings and explores staking and other DeFi options instead of swapping ETH for stablecoins, which adds headwinds for the price. Strategic Dip Buying Levels In case the price fails to overcome the $3,279 resistance, the critical support barrier is $3,060 or roughly $3,000. Beyond this, the 50-day MA at $2,981 and the $2,800 levels are good places where long-term investors can consider scooping ETH at a discount. Key Ethereum Price Levels To Book Profits The short-term Ethereum price forecast hints investors should keep an eye on these key resistance levels at $3,279 and $3,488. Additionally , the 200-day Moving Average (MA) at $3,527 is another level for investors to book profits. From a long-term outlook, Ethereum could reach $3,656, the 2024 highs at $4,098 and the all-time high of $4,878.

Expert Forecasts an Explosive Rally For HBAR Based on the chart outlook, Hedera appears primed for a rally. World of Chart, a crypto market analyst, notes this development in his latest HBAR analysis. According to the analyst, HBAR is trading within a bullish pennant pattern, signaling a potential breakout upward. If this breakout occurs, Hedera’s HBAR could rise 60 to 65% from its current price. The analyst also highlighted the support and resistance levels within the chart pattern, noting that the lower trendline represents a key support and the upper trendline a key resistance level. Each time HBAR hits the lower trendline, it bounces back up, indicating buyers are trying to hold this support zone. Pushing past this price will see HBAR reach unprecedented heights in the near term. HBAR has risen 12.05% this week, raising its price to $0.31 . Spark Integrates Ethena as ENA Enters a Precarious Position Following the announcement that Spark will be integrating Ethena’s stablecoin USDe, ENA has gained stability. It also rose from a low of $0.72 to a high of $0.83 on January 14, 2025. Spark announced it would integrate the USDe and sUSDe into its liquidity pool. To foster this integration, Sparks will allocate up to $1.1 billion worth of stablecoins to the Ethena protocol. Meanwhile, ENA continues to struggle with bearish pressure, causing it to slide below its 25-day and 50-day EMA. Also, the price has formed a double-top pattern on its daily chart, suggesting that the asset may be on the verge of a decline. As a result, ENA investors are buying the PropFi coin $FXG to recoup losses incurred during the downturn. Ethena’s ENA is down 4.47% this week to $0.91. The $FXG Presale Token Targets $1 As attention shifts to $FXG, the presale token has begun gearing up for a rally to a critical mark. Experts predict that the PropFi coin may be targeting $1. $FXG is in Stage 2 of its public presale, selling for $0.04. With $FXG set to list at $0.10, investors can secure a 150% ROI. However, from its current price, hitting $1 would translate to a 2,400% profit for Stage 2 investors. To benefit from $FXG’s rise to $1, click the links below to buy the tokens now!

As Bitcoin (BTC) price retests crucial support level above $100k, more crypto investors are shifting their focus to the altcoin industry in anticipation of an altseason in the near term. Furthermore, Bitcoin dominance has been forming a macro reversal pattern, after hitting a major psychological resistance level above 61 percent. XRP Price Aims for New ATH After hitting a multi-year high of about $3.4 last week, XRP price has been trapped in a correction mode in the four-hour time frame. The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $309 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of about $15 billion, has been forming a potential ABC correction, which often yields a fresh bull run. $XRP has broken out of a bullish flag and now targets $4.40! pic.twitter.com/nP3iDuOuxY — Ali (@ali_charts) January 21, 2025 According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, XRP price is well positioned for a fresh bull rally towards $4.4 in the near term, after potentially breaking out of a bullish flag. Factors Fueling Bullish Outlook Since XRP overtook Tether’s USDT to become the third largest crypto asset by market capitalization, more whale investors have proliferated to the XRPL network. According to on-chain data analysis provided by Santiment, XRP whales, with a balance of between 1 million and 10 million coins, added 100 million coins in the last 2 days to hold about 5.37 billion. The XRP bullish outlook has heavily been bolstered by the political climate change in the United States through Donald Trump. Furthermore, the Trump administration has signaled that the cryptocurrency market will play a crucial role in the economic transformation of the United States in the next four years. With the notable XRPL developments, in line with the mainstream adoption of web3 technology and digital assets, XRP’s price is well positioned to continue leading in the next crypto bullish leg.",News|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|ALTCOIN|MARKET|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-21 11:49:19

The two people who were initially announced to be in charge of the project were Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, but the latter decided to abandon the project and will reportedly focus on becoming the governor of Ohio. Nevertheless, D.O.G.E was officially announced yesterday during Trump’s inauguration speech, and its website now features Dogecoin’s logo, unlike the X page (for now). The meme coin’s price reacted immediately. The asset had tumbled to $0.345 ahead of the logo change but exploded by over 15% within minutes to over $0.4.

According to data from Defillama, the Solana stablecoin market cap has reached $9.88 billion, marking a 67.59% increase in the last seven days. With this increase, stablecoin supply on the network has reached a new all-time high, surpassing its peak of $6.25 billion in June 2022. The surge is mostly tied to the growth of Circle’s USDC in the past few weeks. According to Defillama , USDC has a market cap of $48.16 billion, with a 12% growth in the past month alone. With USDC supply increasing generally, its supply on Solana has also experienced a substantial surge, with a 76.25% rise in the last seven days. It is now the dominant stablecoin on Solana, with a $7.73 billion market cap, enough to account for a 79.72% dominance. Tether’s USDT has $1.66 billion in supply on the network, while PayPal PYUSD, Ondo USDY, and Sky Dollar USDS have $163.1 million, $108.23 million, and $97.8 million, respectively. Despite growing more than 67% in the past seven days, Solana’s stablecoin supply remains substantially below the liquidity on Ethereum and Tron networks. The two account for over 70% of all stablecoins, with $113.118 billion on Ethereum and $59.79 billion on Tron. Solana’s activity surge responsible for stablecoin supply growth The massive increase in Solana’s stablecoin supply and the subsequent increase in liquidity within its ecosystem is a sign of the network’s growth. Solana, one of the best-performing networks in terms of trading volume over the past year, reached a new high over the weekend after President Donald Trump’s team launched the official TRUMP memecoin on the network. The token’s launch, which went to a $20 billion market cap within a few hours, led to massive volume across multiple protocols, with popular SOL wallet Phantom recording over 10 million transactions. Over the last two days, it also set the record for decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume twice, with $28.2 billion and $38.2 billion on January 19 and 20. In the same period, it recorded $1.5 billion in stablecoin swaps. Solana set back-to-back ATH for DEX trading Volume (Source: Dan Smith on X) Meanwhile, the popular cross-chain bridge platform deBrigde reported massive activity on Solana over the weekend. According to its report, over $202 million flowed into the network through deBridge, and more than $97 million came from Ethereum alone. The cross-chain bridge also recorded over $320 million in trading volume. All that activity translated into massive revenue for Solana validators, with the network seeing $50 million in real economic value (REV) on January 20. Jito tips also reached an all-time high of $25.2 million. Solana network surge came with glitches The massive activity on the network over the last few days also presented challenges for the network, with some people claiming that the network experienced an outage at some point. However, Mert Mumtaz , the CEO of Solana infrastructure developer Helius Labs, described the surge in network activity as a valuable stress test. According to him, the network’s leading validator Jito experienced degraded performance due to high demand after the launch of the MELANIA memecoin. In reaction, some users, particularly the sniper bots and arbitrage traders, started using Solana main fees instead of Jito tips, causing fees to go up. Meanwhile, Coinbase has also been criticized for its delays in processing deposits and withdrawals on the Solana network. The exchange suggested long processing times of between 100 and 1000 minutes at some point. Stakeholders noted that this is due to the exchange indexers’ inability to handle the transaction volume. The Block co-founder Mike Dudas said: “coinbase says the future of crypto is on-chain, but they clearly believe on-chain = evm despite solana being the #1 chain by volume.” Competitor exchange Kraken also took that opportunity to take a swipe at Coinbase by stating that SOL is working fine on its platform. Coinbase protocol specialist Andrew Allen acknowledged the issue, noting that this was not Solana’s fault but rather due to the surge in network usage, pushing Coinbase infrastructure past its limits. He added that the exchange is working on a solution.

Signals from the bitcoin options market indicate heightened expectations for short-term price turbulence alongside signs of growing risk aversion among traders since Trump's swearing in, according to Griffin Ardern, head of options trading and research at crypto financial platform BloFin. That could be due to several reasons, including MicroStrategy's impending shareholder vote today on expanding its authorized shares to support its bitcoin buying strategy. In addition, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) is expected to increase rates on Friday, which may strengthen the yen. The late July BOJ rate hike torched the currency's rally, destabilizing risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. There's also uncertainty stemming from Trump's plans to impose tariffs of up to 25% on Canada and Mexico and the looming debt ceiling although, historically, the latter has not had a significant bearish impact on risk assets. ""Markets received a stark reminder of life under President Trump, with more volatility-inducing rhetoric,"" QCP Capital said,. Still, observers remain optimistic. “Despite a generally disappointing first day for cryptocurrencies under the new administration, Bitcoin managed to remain firmly above $101K, sidestepping the feared ‘sell-the-news’ effect,” Valentin Fournier, an analyst at BRN, noted. Fournier added that while regulatory progress and adjustments to national reserves may take time, conditions are expected to improve in the coming weeks. The debut of the TRUMP memecoin over the weekend marked ""a fundamental shift in the American digital asset landscape, ultimately attracting new buyers, particularly into BTC and SOL,"" according to Laurent Benayoun, CEO of Acheron Trading. ""This phenomenon can be seen as a dual narrative: a significant value creation in TRUMP, initially driven by intra-market rotation, which later sparked fresh capital inflows as fundamental investors recognized the broader positive catalysts for digital assets,"" Benayoun said.

One such token themed after son Barron Trump just rug pulled for millions of dollars. A spoof X account impersonating Barron promoted a BARRON token, which quickly gained traction reaching a peak market cap of $87 million. Initially, a significant amount of liquidity was added to make the token appear legitimate and encourage trading. However, it seems the token was designed to deceive from the start. Once the token reached a high buy volume, all liquidity was removed from the token pools causing the price to crash. On-chain watchers estimated at least $1 million worth of Solana’s SOL tokens were extracted in the rug pull, based on initial buying and final selling transactions. Even some industry observers were take in. Derivatives Positioning Open interest in TRUMP perpetual futures has increased 8%, suggesting the price drop is at least partly led by fresh shorts. Opposite is the case for AAVE as prices have risen alongside an uptick in open interest. Other than AAVE, most major coins, including BTC and ETH, have seen negative open interest-adjusted CVD, a sign of net selling pressure. BTC and ETH calls remain pricier than puts, but the call bias is weaker than a day ago. Top block trades for the day include BTC bull call spreads and some outright longs in ETH calls, according to data source Amberdata, Deribit and Paradigm.

However, new coins emerge every day, making it difficult for investors to select the best altcoins and memecoins. In this guide, we will discuss the trending coins and long-term wealth creators - Dogecoin (DOGE), Trump Official (TRUMP), and DTX Exchange (DTX). Dogecoin (DOGE) Trades At Breakout Retest From its low of $0.308 on January 13th, Dogecoin rose to $0.433, surging nearly 40% in just six sessions. This rally followed the market's optimism about Trump's office inauguration. During this rally, Dogecoin broke out of the descending wedge pattern; however, the weekend sell-off dragged the price below $0.40, leading to an 18% decline over two sessions. Currently, Dogecoin is trading at $0.362, with a decline of 6.66% in the past 24 hours. Courtesy: TradingView An immediate bounce from the current retest is crucial for upside price momentum because a failure here can initiate a significant correction. Dogecoin might face resistance at the $0.40 and $0.435 resistance levels, while $0.32 is a major support level on the downside. The unmatched hype and community support could make Dogecoin attractive for investment. Trump Official (TRUMP) Faces High Volatility Amid Melania Memecoin Launch The meme coin market saw new major entrants with the launch of Trump Official (TRUMP) by the new US President Donald Trump. However, the profit booking in Trump Official (TRUMP) increased after the launch of another meme coin by the same family. Late Sunday, Melania Trump introduced her own meme coin, MELANIA, causing the value of her husband’s Trump Official (TRUMP) memecoin to plunge by 47%. The launch of Trump Official (TRUMP) proved highly profitable and drew sharp criticism from ethics experts, who called it a blatant attempt to monetize his return to office. At press time, Trump Official (TRUMP) is trading at $59.04 with a market cap of $11.86 billion. The trading volume in the past 24 hours has increased by 318%, indicating significant hype around the launch. DTX Exchange: Best Altcoin of 2025? DTX Exchange (DTX) is not an ordinary hype-based project but is a transformative platform gaining popularity due to its innovative Hybrid platform. While Dogecoin (DOGE) and Trump Official (TRUMP) do not offer any utility, DTX is solely based on real-world applications. DTX integrates traditional financial (TradFi) and decentralized financial (DeFi) structures in its unified platform. With its unique hybrid model, DTX Exchange provides access to 120,000+ asset classes with a remarkable 1,000X leverage. So, with a capital of $100, one can access liquidity of $100,000 in assets like stocks, crypto, and forex. DTX Exchange also introduces a multi-asset custody solution with its innovative Phoenix Wallet. The wallet has gone viral for its multi-layer security, which saves users from theft. DTX Exchange is built on the L-1 VulcanX blockchain, known for its high efficiency and scalability. In the testnet, the blockchain achieved a record-breaking 100,00 TPS. While the best altcoins in the market have struggled to achieve the milestone, DTX Exchange has done it in the testnet. During the presale, DTX opted for a fair launch system. In most of the coin, Venture Capitalists hold the major supply, which causes large crashes when they offload the coin in the market. DTX Exchange prioritizes the community with the public presale, giving everyone an equal opportunity. In the seventh stage, the DTX token is priced at $0.14 and has raised over $12 million. Experts believe that after the launch, DTX could surge above $30 in a few months and list itself among the best altcoins.

However, the constant influx of new coins makes it challenging for investors to choose the top altcoins and memecoins. This guide will explore the trending coins and long-term wealth builders: Dogecoin (DOGE), Trump Official (TRUMP), and DTX Exchange (DTX). Dogecoin (DOGE) at a Key Resistance Level Dogecoin climbed from a low of $0.308 on January 13th to $0.433, marking a nearly 40% increase in just six trading days. This surge was driven by market optimism surrounding Trump's inauguration. During this uptrend, Dogecoin broke free of the descending wedge pattern, but a weekend sell-off pulled the price back under $0.40, resulting in an 18% drop over two days. Currently, it’s trading at $0.362, experiencing a 6.66% decline over the past 24 hours. Courtesy: TradingView A prompt bounce from the current retest point is essential for continued upward momentum, as failure to do so might trigger a significant correction. Dogecoin could encounter resistance at $0.40 and $0.435, while $0.32 serves as a crucial support level. Its unmatched hype and robust community backing could make Dogecoin an attractive investment. Trump Official (TRUMP) Navigates Volatility After Melania Coin Launch The meme coin sector welcomed a significant new player with the introduction of Trump Official (TRUMP) by the newly inaugurated U.S. President Donald Trump. However, after Melania Trump unveiled her own meme coin, MELANIA, late on Sunday, profit-taking in Trump Official (TRUMP) increased, leading to a 47% drop in value. Launching Trump Official (TRUMP) was immensely profitable but drew criticism from ethics experts, who labeled it an overt attempt to capitalize on Trump's return to office. Currently, Trump Official (TRUMP) is trading at $59.04 with a market capitalization of $11.86 billion. The trading volume surged by 318% in the last 24 hours, highlighting the intense interest around the launch. DTX Exchange: Could It Be the Top Altcoin of 2025? DTX Exchange (DTX) stands out as a game-changing platform, gaining traction for its innovative Hybrid platform, unlike Dogecoin (DOGE) and Trump Official (TRUMP) which rely heavily on hype. DTX is rooted in real-world applications, combining traditional financial (TradFi) and decentralized financial (DeFi) structures within its comprehensive platform. With its distinct hybrid model, DTX Exchange offers access to over 120,000 asset classes with an incredible 1,000X leverage. This means that with $100, one can tap into liquidity worth $100,000 across assets like stocks, cryptocurrencies, and forex. Additionally, DTX Exchange boasts a multi-asset custody solution through its cutting-edge Phoenix Wallet, known for its multi-layer security that protects users from theft. The platform is built on the L-1 VulcanX blockchain, which is celebrated for its efficiency and scalability, achieving an impressive 100,000 TPS on the testnet. While many leading altcoins have struggled to reach such milestones, DTX Exchange has accomplished it during testing. Opting for a fair launch system during its presale, DTX avoids the pitfalls of major coin supply being controlled by Venture Capitalists, which can lead to market crashes when these entities offload their holdings. By prioritizing the community with a public presale, DTX ensures equal opportunities for all. Currently, in its seventh stage, the DTX token is valued at $0.14 and has already raised over $12 million. Experts predict that post-launch, DTX could skyrocket past $30 in a matter of months, positioning itself among the top altcoins.

39255414,https://coingape.com/?p=234552,1737460894,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,XRP News: Ripple Alumni Highlights Strategy To Expand XRPL Revenue By 400X,https://coingape.com/xrp-news-ripple-alumni-highlights-strategy-to-expand-xrpl-revenue-by-400x/,"In the latest XRP news, Ripple alumni Austin King has highlighted the blockchain firm’s secret strategy to dominate the digital assets space. Notably, the former Ripple employee said that XRP Ledger (XRPL) may soon hit new heights. Notably, King has shared his insights suggesting that the XRPL is likely to witness a 400X increase in its revenue ahead. XRP News: Ripple Alumni Highlights Company Goal Ex-Ripple executive Austin King revealed Ripple’s strategic focus in an X thread . He highlighted Ripple’s significant financial backing to Trump’s inauguration, which raised over $200 million breaking records. Notably, he noted that the blockchain firm contributed 500% higher than peers like Coinbase and Kraken, underlining its commitment to building influence. Meanwhile, King emphasized Ripple’s long-standing push for clear regulations. According to him, this aligns with the vision of Ripple Chairman Chris Larsen. Larsen, a fintech pioneer who founded E-Loan and Prosper, views regulation as a stepping stone to establishing Ripple as a global settlement network. This ambition extends beyond payments, aiming to integrate Ripple into the financial ecosystem managing trillions in traditional finance transactions. In other words, King emphasized that Ripple’s strategy hinges on aligning with regulatory frameworks and strengthening ties with the Trump administration, paving the way for a transformative phase in crypto finance. XRP Ledger Revenue To Skyrocket Amid Soaring XRP Adoption The Ripple alumni also noted that the blockchain firm only focused on the payments solution in the “bootstrapping phase”. However, the “real goal” of the firm has always been becoming the “global settlement network for the trillions of dollars in traditional finance.” Austin King noted that this goal might turn into a reality under the Trump administration. Given Ripple executives like CEO Brad Garlinghouse, CLO Stuart Alderoty’s close association with Donald Trump, the firm may benefit from the new crypto-friendly administration. Having said that, King said that this goal might greatly impact XRP and XRPL’s revenue in the coming days. How Will It Impact XRPL? The former Ripple executive said that once Ripple achieves its goal, the banks and financial technology firms will likely buy XRP to manage their assets and transactions on the ledger. In addition, other networks like Ethereum, Solana, and others, might be “forced to reposition around XRP.” On the other hand, it could significantly boost the XRP Ledger revenue, King noted. King estimates that XRPL’s revenue model could expand 400X from its current payments-focused framework to encompass broader financial applications. This evolution would leverage XRP’s utility in global settlements, signaling a new era for Ripple and the crypto market. Top Lawyer Bill Morgan Reacts Pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan, responding to King’s post, raised critical questions about Ripple’s regulatory vision. In a recent X post, Morgan said: But this begs the question, regulated in what manner. Obviously not as a security. His comments underscore the legal ambiguity surrounding XRP’s status and the ongoing Ripple SEC lawsuit . In other words, the potential for Ripple to reshape global finance hinges on regulatory developments. Under a Trump administration, King believes Ripple’s ambitions could gain momentum which has fueled optimism over further positive XRP news in the coming days. XRP Price Dips But Analyst Remains Optimistic XRP price was down nearly 5% today and exchanged hands at $3.10, after touching a 24-hour high of $3.35. Notably, this dip comes amid a broader altcoin market crash , which many experts think was due to the absence of any crypto mention in Trump’s inauguration speech. However, despite the recent dip, analysts remained optimistic about the future trajectory of the token. In a recent X post, popular expert Ali Martinez said that the crypto has reflected a bullish flag while predicting a potential rally to a new ATH of $4.40.

What's the Reason? Statement from Coinbase!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/there-are-problems-in-the-giant-altcoin-network-whats-the-reason-statement-from-coinbase/,"Users on Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States, have reported delays. Accordingly, Coinbase users said that network congestion related to the launch of memecoin TRUMP, launched by US President Donald Trump on January 18, affected the exchange and delayed Solana transactions. These issues began with the launch of the TRUMP and MELANIA memecoins, leading to a surge in activity on the Solana blockchain. This surge caused network congestion and led to delays in Solana transactions on Coinbase. At this point, some users have reported waiting more than 15 hours for their transactions. Some users have also reported that their transactions were canceled after being pending for an entire day. Some users who blamed Coinbase for the delays in Solana transactions claimed that Coinbase was staking SOL without users’ consent. At this point, speculations are growing that the delays could be a result of the staking removal process, with one crypto trader going by the name of CryptoCurb stating, “It seems VERY likely that Coinbase is staking its customers’ SOL without their permission.” The trader questioned Coinbase’s solvency and called for an immediate proof-of-reserve (PoR) audit. “Coinbase estimates 100 minutes for USDC purchases to be processed on Solana. To be clear, these delays have nothing to do with the Solana chain. We are aware that some users may experience delayed sending and receiving on the Solana network. Buys, sells, and fiat withdrawals/deposits are not impacted. Our infrastructure team is working to resolve the issue,” Mert Mumtaz, CEO of Solana infrastructure provider Helius, wrote in an X post. The Coinbase team acknowledged the delays and said they are working to resolve them, but users are still waiting for a resolution to their transaction times. *This is not investment advice.

After Ethereum's Pectra Upgrade, Can ETH Remain One of the Top Altcoins to Buy? The upcoming Ethereum Pectra upgrade is set for early 2025 and could be a game-changer. This upgrade combines the Prague and Electra changes to bring enhanced wallet functions and the ability to batch transactions. A raised validator stake limit and improved scalability are also part of the update. While Ethereum’s tokenomics remain stable, the Pectra upgrade aims to boost speed and usability. These changes solidify Ethereum's position as one of the trending altcoins for DeFi enthusiasts to buy. However, ETH's price movement was slow last week. ETH is currently valued at $3,135.50, a 7.37% decline from last week. Concerning price predictions, some Ethereum experts suggest a bullish run for ETH in the coming weeks because of the upcoming Pectra upgrade. This could catalyze ETH's surge to $3,950. As such, Ethereum experts see the coin as one of the trending altcoins that could turn $100 into $10,000. Conversely, if the bullish trend persists and ETH drops below the $2,900 support level, it could plummet to $2,300. This mixed forecast is pushing investors to $FXG, a DeFi coin they believe could turn $100 into $10,000 due to its unparalleled utility. Experts Chatter About Looming Cardano Hard Fork, But Trending Altcoins Like ADA Decline Cardano enthusiasts are preparing for the highly awaited Plomin hard fork. This upgrade could bring a fully decentralized governance system to Cardano’s network. The Plomin hard fork is receiving strong support from stake pool operators. Voting is currently taking place, and the final decision on this upgrade is expected by January 29, 2025. Once finalized, this update will make Cardano even more decentralized, allowing more people to have a say in its future. Meanwhile, ADA’s price movement lags other trending altcoins. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that ADA is trading at $0.945, a 4.74% decline from last week. Moving forward, some top Cardano experts believe that ADA's value will surge in the coming weeks due to the upcoming hard fork. They believe that this could push its value up to $1.350 in a few weeks. On the other hand, with the crypto market currently experiencing a downturn, some experts wonder if ADA can turn $100 into $10,000. They believe that ADA's value could potentially fall to $0.830 soon. This is why they believe $FXG, one of the hottest ICOs in the market, is the better investment option to turn $100 into $10,000. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE $FXG Gains Attention as a Top Pick to Turn $100 Into $10,000 in 2025 Investors are starting to move past the market dip of late 2024. ADA and ETH are both showing positive signs. These two altcoins are preparing for a potential bull run. However, experts are now pointing to $FXG as a top contender. FXGuys is attracting attention due to its special PropFi features. These features are gaining popularity in the DeFi sector. As more people recognize its value, the token continues to gain momentum. Currently, $FXG is priced at $0.04 during Stage 2 of its public presale. It has already raised $3.4 million, with many investors eager to join. Those who get in now could see significant returns once it officially launches. When $FXG hits the market, it will start at $0.10. That means those who invest now could make over 150% gains. The growth potential for $FXG is looking very promising. Experts predict that $FXG could see a huge price increase after its launch. Some are forecasting a 100x price boost, meaning that it can turn $100 to $10,000. This makes $FXG one of the best altcoins to buy right now!

The forthcoming Ethereum Pectra update, expected in early 2025, could be transformative. This upgrade merges the Prague and Electra changes to enhance wallet functionalities and enable batch transactions. It also raises the validator stake limit and improves scalability. Despite Ethereum's stable tokenomics, the Pectra update aims to enhance speed and usability, reinforcing Ethereum's status as a leading altcoin for DeFi enthusiasts. However, ETH's price movement was sluggish last week, currently valued at $3,135.50, a 7.37% dip from the previous week. Some Ethereum experts foresee a bullish trend for ETH in the coming weeks, driven by the impending Pectra upgrade, potentially propelling ETH's value to $3,950. Thus, Ethereum remains a trending altcoin that might convert $100 into $10,000. On the flip side, if the bullish momentum weakens and ETH falls below the $2,900 support level, it could drop to $2,300. This mixed outlook is steering investors towards $FXG, a DeFi coin believed to have the potential to turn $100 into $10,000 due to its unmatched utility. Cardano's Anticipated Hard Fork Sparks Expert Discussion, but ADA Faces Decline Cardano supporters are eagerly awaiting the much-anticipated Plomin hard fork, which could introduce a fully decentralized governance system to Cardano’s network. The Plomin hard fork is receiving robust support from stake pool operators, with voting currently underway. The final decision is expected by January 29, 2025, and once completed, this update will enhance Cardano's decentralization, giving more people a voice in its future direction. Meanwhile, ADA’s price performance is trailing other trending altcoins. CoinMarketCap data shows ADA trading at $0.945, a 4.74% drop from last week. Looking ahead, some top Cardano experts anticipate a price surge for ADA in the coming weeks due to the upcoming hard fork, potentially boosting its value to $1.350. However, amid the current crypto market downturn, some experts question whether ADA can transform $100 into $10,000, fearing its value might decline to $0.830. This uncertainty is why $FXG, one of the most exciting ICOs around, is seen as a better investment to achieve such gains. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE $FXG Emerges as a Leading Choice to Transform $100 Into $10,000 by 2025 As investors move beyond the market slump of late 2024, ADA and ETH are showing signs of recovery, gearing up for a potential bull run. Nonetheless, experts are now highlighting $FXG as a prime candidate. FXGuys is attracting attention with its unique PropFi features, gaining traction in the DeFi sector. As more people recognize its potential, the token continues to gain momentum. Currently, $FXG is priced at $0.04 during Stage 2 of its public presale, having already raised $3.4 million, with many investors keen to participate. Early investors might see significant returns once it officially launches. Upon market entry, $FXG will debut at $0.10, offering early investors the opportunity for over 150% gains. The future looks bright for $FXG's growth potential. Experts forecast a substantial price increase for $FXG post-launch, with some predicting a 100x boost, indicating it could turn $100 into $10,000. This positions $FXG as one of the top altcoins to purchase right now!

A notable example is Lightchain AI , an innovative cryptocurrency that combines artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. Currently in its presale stage at $0.005, Lightchain AI has already gathered $11.6 million, showing substantial investor trust. In contrast to Bitcoin Cash, which is centered around transaction efficiency, Lightchain AI builds a forward-looking ecosystem aimed at empowering decentralized AI applications, addressing crucial challenges such as scalability, governance, and data transparency. With its state-of-the-art technology and ambitious roadmap, Lightchain AI offers a disruptive potential that could yield 100x growth, positioning it as a strong contender for a top spot in the crypto market. Why Bitcoin Cash Justifies the FOMO Bitcoin Cash has gained a reputation as a preferred choice in the crypto market by overcoming Bitcoin's shortcomings, particularly regarding transaction speed and scalability. Its capability to manage larger transaction volumes with reduced fees makes it a practical option for real-world applications, from everyday transactions to extensive financial integrations. The coin's steady development and the support of a loyal community have propelled its adoption, securing its position among the leading cryptocurrencies. As blockchain technology becomes more widespread, Bitcoin Cash's focus on efficiency and usability continues to strike a chord with investors and users. While its progress justifies the FOMO surrounding it, the crypto landscape is rapidly changing, with newer projects like Lightchain AI emerging as formidable competitors, offering innovative solutions that extend beyond scalability and incorporate cutting-edge technology for future-ready applications. Lightchain AI's 100x Growth Potential Lightchain AI is gaining attention in the crypto world as a project with the potential for massive returns.

Its distinct Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism revolutionizes network validation by rewarding nodes for valuable AI computations. This innovation meets the growing demand for AI-driven technologies, distinguishing Lightchain AI in a competitive market. The project's bold roadmap, which includes a mainnet launch and cross-chain integrations, further enhances its long-term potential. With $11.6 million raised during its presale and a price of only $0.005, Lightchain AI provides investors with a unique chance to get involved early in a transformative venture poised for significant growth, making it a leading candidate for 100x returns. Is Lightchain AI Destined to Be a Leading Cryptocurrency? Lightchain AI possesses all the attributes of a future-leading cryptocurrency. Its distinct approach, blending blockchain with artificial intelligence, positions it to address some of the most critical challenges in both sectors, including scalability, transparency, and fair governance. Lightchain AI's decentralized governance ensures the platform evolves through community-driven decisions, fostering trust and inclusivity. Unlike many cryptocurrencies focused solely on transactional efficiency, Lightchain AI enables developers to build AI-powered decentralized applications (dApps) with real-world utility. Its roadmap, featuring cross-chain integration and ecosystem expansion, showcases a forward-thinking vision appealing to both retail and institutional investors. At its current presale price of $0.005 and $11.6 million already raised, the coin is gaining considerable momentum. These elements suggest that Lightchain AI could ascend to a top-tier cryptocurrency position in the evolving digital asset landscape. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Why FOMO Over Bitcoin Cash is Justified Bitcoin Cash has earned its reputation as a crypto market favorite by addressing Bitcoin's limitations, particularly in terms of transaction speed and scalability. Its ability to handle higher transaction volumes at lower fees positions it as a practical solution for real-world use cases, from daily payments to large-scale financial integrations. The coin's consistent development and support from a dedicated community have fueled its adoption and cemented its place among the top cryptocurrencies. As blockchain adoption grows, Bitcoin Cash's focus on efficiency and usability continues to resonate with investors and users alike. While its momentum justifies the FOMO surrounding it, the crypto space is evolving rapidly, and newer projects like Lightchain AI are emerging as strong competitors, offering innovative solutions that go beyond scalability to integrate cutting-edge technology for future-ready applications.

An executive order of the department's establishment was issued shortly thereafter. The department holds no official power to enforce its recommendations and is headed by technocrat Elon Musk. The website started to display a dogecoin token logo on Tuesday, despite having no direct relation to the world’s largest memecoin. DOGE was down as much as 5% in the past 24 hours, before reversing losses, tracking a nearly 5% drop in the broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20) and a 3% slide in bitcoin (BTC). A parody token, meanwhile, is up 6% with the bulk of gains made during the European morning. Musk first raised the idea of DOGE in October as a non-governmental agency to make government spending more efficient. That has since fueled expectation among traders that there could be more chatter of “DOGE” in mainstream media and retail trading circles, fueling attention and interest in dogecoin, as a CoinDesk analysis noted in mid-October . DOGE isn’t appreciated in government quarters and faces lawsuits . The National Security Counselors, a legal advocacy group, claims the committee violates the Federal Advisory Committee Act of 1972, which requires advisory groups to operate transparently. It says the department has an unclear legal structure.

Legal expert John Deaton recently weighed in, offering details into what could happen next, especially in light of the recent developments surrounding the case. No Strong Reason for SEC to Appeal On the Good Morning Crypto Show, Deaton explains that there’s really no strong reason for the SEC to appeal the case. While they may feel disappointed by the current outcome, especially with over 75,000 XRP holders joining the case in support of Ripple, Deaton believes the SEC’s appeal may not hold much weight. Judge Torres already ruled that the SEC failed to satisfy certain criteria, which means even if the case were to go to appeal, it would likely return to Judge Torres with a similar result. Essentially, Ripple would win again. Furthermore, Deaton believes that if the case were to go to the Second Circuit Court, it would likely rule in favor of Ripple, reaffirming Judge Torres’ earlier decision. And if the SEC somehow won, the case could eventually make its way to the Supreme Court—resulting in more legal battles and delays. Positive News for Ripple Investors: SEC Could Dismiss the Case However, there is some positive news for Ripple investors. Deaton points out that the current acting director of the SEC, along with Paul Atkins, who has been critical of the agency’s stance, could be key in pushing for the dismissal of the case. With a majority vote of three out of five commissioners, the SEC could decide to drop the case entirely, considering the growing sentiment that XRP serves a legitimate purpose in the market, much like other major cryptocurrencies. For the unversed, the SEC has appealed a federal court’s decision. On January 15, the SEC filed its arguments to the Second Circuit Appeals Court, claiming the New York District Court was wrong to rule that XRP sales to retail investors were not unregistered securities. The SEC wants the appeals court to reverse the July 2023 ruling by Judge Analisa Torres, which excluded XRP sales to retail investors from being classified as unregistered securities.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-21 12:13:58

This decline coincided with that of many coins as the altcoin season remains elusive. However, the upcoming KYC grace period deadline and a possible mainnet launch may propel the Pi coin price up sharply, potentially toward $200. Pi Network Price Provides Buying Opportunity Ahead of Grace Period Deadline The Pi coin has crashed as investors eye the upcoming grace period of the Know Your Customer (KYC) deadline . This deadline, which will happen on January 31, will be a crucial step towards the mainnet launch. KYC verification involves the millions of pioneers in the ecosystem verifying their identities. It is an automated process that involves top validators and built-in technology to verify users from over 200 countries and territories. The goal is to ensure that the Pi network does not have bots, as many tap-to-earn network games have. The developers hope that at least 10 million pioneers will move their Pi coins to the mainnet. They will then proceed on to the next stage of the mainnet launch if the number of verified and migrated pioneers is at least 10 million. Their recent two deadline extensions aimed at reaching this milestone. Pi Network also hopes there will be at least 100 mainnet-ready applications before the mainnet launch. This outlook is unlikely as only there are less than 80 of these apps as of this writing. Therefore, there is a possibility that the Pi coin price will bounce back if the developers don’t provide another deadline extension. Can the Pi Coin Price Hit $200? The daily chart shows that the Pi token price peaked at near $100 in November and has been in a strong downtrend after the two grace period extensions. This chart paints a strong bearish picture for the coin now that it has dropped below the key support at $44, its lowest swings since November 12. It has also crashed below all moving averages, signaling that bears are in control for now. Another way to look at this price action is that the Pi Network price is slowly forming a double-bottom pattern at $3, and the neckline is at $100. A double-bottom usually leads to a strong rebound. If this happens, then the next point to watch will be at $100. A break above that neckline may see the Pi Network price soar to $200, the highest level in December 2023. Such a move would imply a 357% surge from the current level. That price movement is possible in crypto as happened with the 500% XRP price surge . Pi Network Price Chart A crash below the potential double-bottom pattern at $30 will invalidate the bullish view and point to more downside. This decline may be triggered by a grace period or mainnet launch extension. Pi Network Price Weekly Chart Analysis The weekly chart also points to a potential Pi Network price surge too. The condensed chart shows that the token formed an ascending channel and its weekly volume has been falling. A drop in volume could be a sign of accumulation. Pi Network Price Chart The price has now moved to the lower side of the ascending channel and is slightly below the key S&R level at $46. Therefore, a break above the middle side of this channel may point to a jump to $200, the upper side of this regression channel.

Debuting on the Solana (SOL) blockchain, TRUMP exploded in value and so did SOL, creating new all-time highs. At the same time, Ripple (XRP) maintained support above $3 in preparation for its next leg up. Also in the spotlight and stirring up excitement is DTX Exchange (DTX) and its projected upswing this quarter. Its unique blend of traditional and decentralized finance has become a subject of much interest, as is its impending transformation of the $10 billion global crypto trading market. Set to explode, it is a new DeFi project to watch out for. DTX Exchange (DTX): A New DeFi Crypto in the Spotlight DTX Exchange (DTX) basks in the spotlight, standing out from most new ICOs and presale tokens. Its real-world application and huge growth prospects are some of its biggest attractions, sending early funding past $12 million. Alongside its rapidly expanding community, DTX might be the best new crypto to invest in. In the seventh round of the ICO, it is significantly undervalued at $0.14—a retail and whale favorite. Unlike most utility tokens, it isn’t VC-backed nor is the majority supply of the token held by a few—over 300,000 wallets have been registered. This democratized launch and the projected 35x jump in value post-launch make it a promising wave not to miss. Further, its future transformation of the global trading scene by combining TradFi with key decentralized principles like wallet-based trading and non-custodial storage solutions has been hailed as groundbreaking. As the first crypto-native platform to offer conventional assets like stocks, ETFs, forex and over 100,000 currency pairs, it is poised for massive adoption—perhaps the next Solana (SOL) or Ripple (XRP). Solana (SOL): A New ATH The Layer-1 crypto Solana (SOL) was the star over the weekend. Its value almost doubled on the weekly chart, rising from a low of $173 to $294—a new all-time high. An inch away from hitting $300, it is among the altcoins to watch out for. Behind this uptick is the TRUMP memecoin launch on the Solana blockchain—the third largest memecoin and the leading meme on the Solana blockchain. Even more impressive is how the memecoin achieved this feat in just two days. Meanwhile, technical indicators like the MACD Level and 20-VWMA hint at further uptrends in the Solana price. At the same time, sentiment is more bullish—a good crypto to buy. Despite the explosive growth, TheExRuler_44, a crypto analyst, believes Solana (SOL) is still undervalued and predicts a run toward $800 and $1,200. Tendorian9, another crypto analyst, eyes $1,000 this cycle. However, DTX Exchange might be a more compelling bet for higher ROI this quarter. Ripple (XRP): How High Can It Go This Cycle? Ripple (XRP), the payment-based cryptocurrency, is also in the spotlight. Its impressive weekly performance was propelled by rumors about a US strategic crypto reserve, crossing $3. Although there has been a slight decline since then, it is still among the best altcoins. Nevertheless, bullish technical indicators like the XRP price trading above the 10-EMA ($2.915) and 10-SMA ($2.913) hint at a big leap. Moreover, crypto analyst Orangie has $50 as their price prediction this year—a bold forecast. A more modest prediction is by digitalatif—a rally past $5 in 2025. While Ripple (XRP) is among the best coins to invest in, its large market cap leaves little room for growth. DTX Exchange (DTX) might be a better bet, especially considering its projected 35x upswing this quarter—a new DeFi coin to watch. DTX Exchange (DTX): The Next Solana (SOL) or Ripple (XRP) Solana (SOL) and Ripple (XRP) have been at the forefront of this bull run, with the altcoins prioritized for the proposed strategic crypto reserve. Gearing up to replicate their success is DTX Exchange (DTX), a new DeFi coin. It has exploded over 500% in the past few months, with a 35x rally projected this quarter—a top crypto to buy.

This move not only boosted TRUMP's value but also propelled SOL to new all-time highs. Concurrently, Ripple (XRP) held strong above $3 as it prepares for its next upward move. Adding to the excitement is DTX Exchange (DTX) , which is set to make significant gains this quarter. Its innovative mix of traditional and decentralized finance has captured attention, especially with its potential to revolutionize the $10 billion global crypto trading market. Poised for a breakout, it's a DeFi project worth watching. DTX Exchange (DTX): Emerging DeFi Crypto Drawing Attention DTX Exchange (DTX) is making waves, distinguishing itself from typical ICOs and presale tokens. Its practical applications and vast growth potential have driven early funding beyond $12 million. With a rapidly growing community, DTX could be the top new crypto to invest in. Currently in its seventh ICO round, it remains undervalued at $0.14, attracting both retail and whale investors. Unlike many utility tokens, it isn’t backed by venture capitalists, and its supply isn’t concentrated among a few holders—over 300,000 wallets are registered. This democratized approach and the expected 35x value increase post-launch make it a promising opportunity. Moreover, its anticipated impact on the global trading landscape, merging traditional finance with key decentralized features like wallet-based trading and non-custodial storage, is seen as revolutionary. As the first crypto-native platform offering conventional assets such as stocks, ETFs, forex, and over 100,000 currency pairs, it is set for widespread adoption—potentially following in the footsteps of Solana (SOL) or Ripple (XRP). Solana (SOL): Achieving a New Record Solana (SOL), a Layer-1 cryptocurrency, was the highlight over the weekend. Its price nearly doubled in a week, climbing from $173 to $294, marking a new all-time high. With $300 within reach, it's an altcoin to keep an eye on. This surge was driven by the launch of the TRUMP memecoin on Solana, which became the third-largest memecoin and the leading meme on the Solana blockchain within just two days. Technical indicators such as the MACD Level and 20-VWMA suggest further upward trends for Solana's price. Currently, sentiment remains bullish, making it an attractive crypto to buy. Despite its rapid rise, TheExRuler_44, a crypto analyst, believes Solana (SOL) is still undervalued, predicting a future price run towards $800 and $1,200. Another analyst, Tendorian9, foresees $1,000 in this cycle. However, DTX Exchange could offer a better return on investment this quarter. Ripple (XRP): Potential Peak This Cycle? Ripple (XRP), known for its payment functionalities, is also in the limelight. Its strong weekly performance was fueled by speculation about a US strategic crypto reserve, pushing it past $3. Although it has seen a slight pullback since then, it remains one of the top altcoins. Positive technical signals, such as XRP trading above the 10-EMA ($2.915) and 10-SMA ($2.913), indicate potential for significant gains. Crypto analyst Orangie predicts a bold $50 price target this year. A more conservative forecast comes from digitalatif, suggesting a rise past $5 by 2025. While Ripple (XRP) is a strong investment choice, its large market cap might limit growth. DTX Exchange (DTX) could be a more lucrative option, especially with its projected 35x increase this quarter—a DeFi coin to keep an eye on. DTX Exchange (DTX): The Next Big Thing Like Solana (SOL) or Ripple (XRP) Solana (SOL) and Ripple (XRP) have been leaders in the current bull run, both prioritized for the proposed strategic crypto reserve. Looking to mirror their success is DTX Exchange (DTX), a fresh DeFi asset. It has surged over 500% in recent months, with a 35x rally anticipated this quarter, making it a top crypto to consider investing in.

Investors are searching for the best altcoins to provide an explosive increase, as 2025 is already here, and the market is ready for another possible bull run. Rexas Finance (RXS) is one of the rising contenders that will most likely turn $50 into $500 this month. Why Rexas Finance (RXS) is the One to Watch Rexas Finance’s creative approach to blockchain utility and amazing presale performance have helped it become popular. At $0.175 in its 11th presale stage, RXS has sold 404.1 million tokens and raised $37.3 million already. This great demand shows investor faith in its ability to upend established sectors and bring significant profits. Rexas Finance is a game-changer in asset tokenizing, not only another cryptocurrency. The project lets real-world assets, including intellectual property, fine art, and real estate, show themselves as blockchain-based tokens. This gives these usually illiquid markets transparency and liquidity, generating great demand for the RXS token. The Numbers That Matter Let us separate the possible returns. A $50 investment guarantees almost 285 RXS tokens at a $0.175 price tag if RXS gets just $1.75—well within the range of possibility considering its strong foundations—that $50 investment would increase to $500. To provide amazing returns, RXS doesn’t have to soar skyward. Its well-structured tokenomics, growing adoption, and expanding ecosystem offer a solid foundation for sustained price appreciation. What Makes RXS the Best Bet for January? Certik Audit and Market Credibility Rexas Finance has established itself as a secure and reliable project and recently achieved a higher security grade. Moreover, it appears on the CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko platforms, enhancing its visibility and attracting retail and institutional investors. Token Builder and Launchpad The platform’s token builder and launchpad have established a dynamic ecosystem that enables the production of bespoke tokens and simplifies the launch of innovative blockchain enterprises. This increases demand for RXS tokens and guarantees the project’s relevance and responsiveness to future market needs. / Positioned for Market Cycles With the cryptocurrency market frequently following cyclical patterns, January 2025 is shaping up to be a pivotal month for altcoin rallies. Historically, enterprises with strong fundamentals and novel use cases, like Rexas Finance, have thrived in such conditions, giving exponential gains to early investors. The Growth Potential Rexas Finance’s path has been spectacular, but its greatest potential lies ahead. As the adoption of blockchain technology accelerates, the demand for asset tokenization solutions is likely to expand tremendously. Industry analysts believe this sector might reach trillions of dollars in value within the next decade. RXS is well-positioned to benefit from this trend. Its creative solutions, strong community, and strategic relationships make it a top contender for explosive growth. Moreover, the project’s ability to integrate traditional finance with blockchain technology ensures it appeals to a broad spectrum of customers, from retail investors to huge institutions. This wide appeal lays a solid foundation for long-term success and continuous demand. Risks to Consider Although the possible benefits are alluring, one should also consider the hazards. Cryptocurrency investing is erratic by nature, and market conditions change quickly. Projects face competition, legal obstacles, and changing investor moods regardless of their great potential. Still, Rexas Finance’s robust foundations, proven track record, and rising acceptance greatly reduce these risks. Prudent investment and diversification can help investors balance possible returns with risk control. Final Thoughts: Turning $50 Into $500 Rexas Finance is the finest altcoin to provide significant gains in January 2025 from the several possibilities present in the market. Substantial presale success, creative approach to asset tokenization, and evolving ecosystem position set this project as rather promising. RXS presents a strong opportunity for anyone looking for a low-cost entrance point with a great upside. As the project gains momentum and acceptance, a $50 investment could begin a tenfold or more rewarding trip. If history has any lessons, they are that early identification and action on possibilities pay off in the crypto market. Rexas Finance is that possibility to turn a meager investment into major riches as the market heats up.

Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) Axlflops has kicked off its much-anticipated token generation event (TGE) for its native token, $AIGT. This token will function as the utility token within the Axlflops ecosystem, encouraging and rewarding community engagement. The launch of this event aligns with the start of its first community rewards program, which will distribute a total of 10 million $AIGT tokens—equivalent to 1.4% of the entire token supply—through several reward pools. The TGE and the rewards program will officially begin on January 22nd, 2025, with the rewards initiative continuing until March 22nd. By offering these incentives, Axlflops intends to encourage both GPU suppliers and community members to contribute to building a more decentralized computing infrastructure. The recently unveiled project offers a DEPIN that aims to democratize AI computing, balancing the need for computing resources across a decentralized network. Moreover, the network uses advanced algorithms to deliver flexible, accessible, and cost-efficient computing power to all users. Axlflops Plans to Distribute 10 Million $AIGT Tokens The community rewards program will be split into two distinct pools: one dedicated to worker rewards and the other for the general community. The first pool, “worker rewards for GPU providers,” is the larger of the two, with plans to distribute 8 million $AIGT tokens, while the second pool, “community questing rewards for regular users,” will contain a 2 million $AIGT rewards pool. Participants have the chance to engage in both pools simultaneously to maximize their earnings. During the initial phase, ending on March 31, GPU providers can join the decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) without any staking requirements, allowing them to choose their desired participation length. Final token distributions will depend on Computing Resource Contributions and Hardware Performance Ratings, with a tiered structure that provides welcome bonuses, weekly rewards, and uptime bonuses. GPU providers can track and claim their rewards through the official Axlflops website. The community quest rewards will be available on the Galxe and Taskon platforms, where participants can earn rewards by engaging in various activities on social media and the platforms themselves. Tasks that offer rewards include following Axlflops on social media, joining community activities, and interacting with the official website. After the event concludes on March 22nd, participants will receive their distributions, while daily GPU mining rewards will continue to be issued according to Axlflops’ standard protocol. Transforming Decentralized AI Computing Axlflops distinguishes itself from other decentralized AI computing companies with its unique approach to democratizing AI computing resources. The platform integrates both individual GPU providers and established cloud services, creating a collaborative environment where private and public clouds coexist within the same partner network. Additionally, the platform features an innovative dual staking mechanism, requiring GPU providers to stake 95% of their tokens, while token holders must stake 5% of $AIGT tokens. This fosters a cooperative ecosystem and offers user-friendly features such as a 7-day unstaking period, competitive service fees (0.2%), and the ability to withdraw daily rewards immediately. Furthermore, Axlflops has introduced an advanced ‘Instance Grading System’ that assesses GPU performance as well as the entire hardware ecosystem, including CPU, RAM, storage, and network capabilities. This ensures accurate performance evaluations and equitable reward distribution, creating a strong ecosystem where AI developers, data scientists, enterprises, and all users needing computing resources can access them at optimal prices.

Amp (AMP) is a decentralized collateral token facilitating fast and secure payment transactions on the Flexa network. Amp’s purpose is to enhance the adaptability of cryptocurrencies for day-to-day payments by addressing the issues of potential fraud and slow-speed transactions of typical cryptocurrencies. Amp also helps users stake tokens without physically transferring them to a smart contract. This function makes Amp suitable for any form of value exchange, including digital payments, traditional currency exchange, loan distributions, real estate transactions, and more.

AMP price analysis gives out a highly bullish prediction regarding the ongoing market trends. AMP/USD value has spiked up to a $0.00761 high in the last 24 hours. On the other hand, the cryptocurrency lost up to 10.57 percent of its value during the day. The overall market sentiment remains negative, whereas the bulls secured victory today. Is AMP a good investment? AMP has been struggling with a bearish trend for the past few months. Despite this, its strong fundamentals suggest it could be a solid long-term investment. Crypto analysts suggest that the approaching weeks can steadily increase the cryptocurrency’s value. A bullish rally may be expected in the latter part of this year (2025), potentially pushing the AMP above $0.015. Why is AMP up? AMP’s price has increased today. Additionally, the coin has experienced a loss of 10.57% if observed over the last 24 hours. The price is trading at $0.00761 as the coin is under a bullish spell for now, moreover, the bulls remained on the lead in the past few days. Will AMP reach $0.010? AMP’s resistance level is at $0.008, yet a break above this level is possible if sufficient buying momentum builds. A break near or above $0.010 will require a more robust push but isn’t impossible, as the coin achieved this level on December 3, 2024. Will AMP reach $1? Amp has never spiked above the $0.12 level. Even this price mark was observed only once at the start of the token’s launch, and AMP has never seen this level again. It seems highly unlikely for AMP to achieve $1 soon. Will AMP reach $10? According to the price prediction, AMP will not achieve this level in the next 10 years until something unusual happens. Considering AMP’s current market cap of only $630.88 million, the scenario seems almost impossible. Does AMP have a good long-term Future? Amp is trading near its average price level if observed over the longest price period levels. It can be a good long-term investment, as its price is expected to double in 2025 and reach $0.0603 by 2031.

39258426,https://invezz.com/?p=2462156,1737466695,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Finland launches first crypto ETPs on Nasdaq Helsinki,https://invezz.com/news/2025/01/21/finland-launches-first-crypto-etps-on-nasdaq-helsinki/,"Finland has taken a significant leap in crypto adoption, introducing its first exchange-traded products (ETPs) on Nasdaq Helsinki. The launch marks a turning point for the Nordic region, with Finland becoming a key player in integrating cryptocurrency into regulated investment channels. These ETPs, issued by Swedish asset manager Virtune, enable Finnish investors to access cryptocurrencies directly using euros, removing the barriers associated with unregulated trading platforms. While cryptocurrency adoption has faced challenges globally due to regulatory scrutiny and volatility, this development signals a maturing market in the Nordics. With the global crypto ETP market valued at $10.7 billion in 2024, Finland’s move highlights the region’s growing appetite for secure and transparent crypto investment options. Why Finland’s crypto ETP launch matters Finland’s entry into the crypto ETP space is not just about offering new investment vehicles—it represents a broader shift in market dynamics. With €20.5 billion in exchange-traded products already circulating in the country, the inclusion of crypto products underscores the increasing demand for alternative assets. Virtune’s five ETPs cover popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Solana. An altcoin index provides exposure to 10 leading alternative tokens. This variety caters to both novice and seasoned investors, allowing for diversification within the digital asset space. The timing is critical. Crypto’s mainstream acceptance has been bolstered by institutional interest and regulatory clarity, making it more accessible and less speculative. Virtune’s products are physically backed and fully collateralised, addressing investor concerns about security and asset verification. This transparency aligns with the growing call for stricter oversight in the crypto industry, particularly in Europe, where frameworks like MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation) aim to establish a unified regulatory standard. Expanding the Nordic investment landscape The launch is particularly noteworthy as it positions Finland alongside other Nordic countries embracing blockchain technology. With Nasdaq Helsinki facilitating this debut, it reinforces the exchange’s role as a pioneer in adapting to evolving market needs. The collaboration highlights the convergence of traditional finance and blockchain, a trend increasingly observed in global markets. Unlike conventional investment methods, these crypto ETPs offer Finnish investors the advantage of staking rewards for assets like Ethereum and Solana. This feature could encourage broader participation by blending the appeal of passive income with the security of regulated trading. Furthermore, Finland’s initiative reflects a strategic move to retain competitiveness within the Nordic financial ecosystem. Major brokers like Nordnet are onboard, ensuring seamless integration into existing investment channels. This accessibility could potentially boost Finland’s standing as a hub for innovative financial solutions. The Nordic region Finland’s debut of crypto ETPs not only impacts its domestic market but also sets a precedent for the Nordic region. Sweden and Denmark have already made strides in crypto regulation, and Finland’s entry strengthens the Nordics’ collective influence on Europe’s crypto landscape. The move comes amid growing institutional interest in digital assets, as companies like BlackRock and Fidelity explore similar offerings in the US and UK. This alignment with global trends positions Finland as a progressive player, bridging the gap between traditional finance and emerging technologies. Moreover, the success of these ETPs could encourage other European markets to explore similar products, further integrating cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial ecosystem. With Virtune’s launch being the largest simultaneous crypto ETP introduction in Nordic history, Finland has set the bar high for innovation and adoption in the region.

As Gary Gensler steps down, his successor inherits a challenging portfolio, including the highly contentious lawsuit against Ripple Labs over the classification of XRP as a security. Uyeda, known for his pro-crypto stance, has long criticised the SEC’s rigid approach under Gensler. This transition comes at a time when the market seeks clarity and innovation in the crypto space, potentially setting the stage for transformative changes in regulatory policies. Ripple’s lawsuit under a new SEC administration Ripple Labs has been embroiled in a legal battle with the SEC since 2020, a case that significantly impacted XRP’s market trajectory and regulatory perception. The lawsuit, centred on whether XRP is a security, saw the SEC adopt an aggressive stance, deterring innovation and creating uncertainty in the crypto industry. Mark Uyeda’s leadership introduces hope for a more balanced regulatory environment. His prior statements advocating for regulatory clarity could lead to reconsideration of Ripple’s case, paving the way for a potential settlement or revised guidelines that benefit both investors and developers. Uyeda’s role may also influence the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem, signalling a shift in how the SEC approaches enforcement actions. This could reduce legal ambiguity for crypto projects, fostering greater confidence among stakeholders and encouraging innovation in the blockchain sector. XRP’s market performance signals optimism XRP’s recent market activity reflects a bullish sentiment, driven by speculation around potential changes in regulatory oversight. In the past 30 days, XRP has outperformed major cryptocurrencies, with a growth of 36%, highlighting investor optimism. On January 16, XRP reached a peak of $3.4021 before stabilising at $3.1013, maintaining strong momentum despite market volatility. Source: CoinMarketCap This performance coincides with increased whale activity, as significant investors accumulated over 100 million XRP in just two days. Such movements indicate heightened confidence in XRP’s future, fuelled by expectations of more favourable regulatory conditions under Uyeda. The road ahead One of the most anticipated outcomes of Uyeda’s tenure is the potential approval of XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Market participants argue that the absence of such instruments limits investor access and mainstream adoption. The new SEC chair’s pro-crypto perspective could expedite ETF approvals, unlocking new growth avenues for Ripple and strengthening XRP’s position in the global market. Moreover, analysts predict that XRP could reach $4.33 by April 2025 if current trends persist. With at least 60% green trading days in the last month, the token exhibits a robust bullish pattern, suggesting sustained upward momentum. Achieving these milestones will depend on both regulatory developments and Ripple’s ability to leverage its blockchain infrastructure to attract institutional partners.

As Bitcoin’s price reaches new heights, Ethereum’s native token, Ether (ETH), is facing mounting pressure, reflected in a significant decline in the BTC-to-ETH ratio. Trump’s memecoins propel Solana as Ethereum lags Ethereum’s cryptocurrency continues to lose ground to competing tokens as it struggles to capitalize on the momentum generated by former President Donald Trump’s foray into the speculative digital assets market. On Monday, the Ether-to-Bitcoin price ratio fell to its lowest in three years. At the same time, Bitcoin reached a new record of $109,241. Solana, on the other hand, saw its native token reach new highs over the weekend. Since his November victory, the president’s pro-crypto stance has boosted many significant digital assets. Solana’s recent surge was mainly driven by Trump and his wife, Melania, launching two memecoins on the blockchain in the lead-up to his inauguration. Trump’s coin saw frenzied trading, reaching a market cap of $15 billion before a sharp decline. According to Le Shi, Hong Kong managing director at market-making firm Auros, Ether has been left behind in the latest memecoin wave, as many of the top memecoins have emerged within the Solana ecosystem. Ether faces subdued demand and lacks new developments Solana’s token price ratio against Ether reached an all-time high on Sunday, driven by speculation surrounding Trump’s coins. Ether remains underwhelmingly 30% below its 2021 peak. Ether’s relatively subdued demand has raised concerns among investors. In the past three months, Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. have attracted over $17 billion in net inflows, compared to just $3 billion for similar Ether products. Le Shi noted that the market believes Ether has stagnated because there haven’t been any intriguing new breakthroughs. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently said that the Ethereum Foundation’s leadership structure would change, with an emphasis on making the network more decentralized and censorship-resistant. Buterin stressed, however, that the entity will not engage in “lobbying regulators and powerful political figures.” Although Trump’s memecoins generated significant interest, the broader crypto market saw a retracement of gains as Trump was sworn in on Monday. There had been expectations that he would issue an executive order making cryptocurrency a national priority, but as of now, no directive has been released.

These ecosystems have shown promise, particularly in the value of their native tokens. If you’ve ever wondered what makes crypto ecosystems like POPG, Dogecoin, and Ethereum tick, you are in the right place. In this deep dive, we explore the top 10 crypto ecosystems that not only have potential but are shaping the future of how we interact with the blockchain. So, buckle up—this is where the future is being built. What is the role of crypto ecosystems and platforms in fostering innovation? Crypto ecosystems and platforms are key in fostering innovation within the Web3 ecosystem. They ensure utility and engagement in crypto projects, which eventually drive value to their tokens. Other key roles include: Addressing the blockchain trilemma. The blockchain trilemma states that no crypto ecosystem can achieve scalability, decentralization, and security, without compromising one. Crypto ecosystems take a multi-faceted approach to resolving this trilemma by implementing novel mechanisms and off-chain solutions, including leveraging the strengths of other ecosystems. These innovations ensure they can handle more users without compromising security or network autonomy. Enabling Diverse Applications Crypto ecosystems empower developers to create innovative applications by providing them with grants and documentation without having to reinvent the underlying blockchain technology. Such setups encourage creativity in various sectors, ranging from entertainment and supply chains to healthcare and decentralized finance (DeFi). Cross-Sector Collaboration Collaboration between different sectors is vital in achieving blockchain’s full potential. Crypto ecosystems also prioritize interoperability across blockchains, meaning more benefits for the community. Cross-sector collaboration brings more liquidity, flexibility, scalability, and enhanced innovation. Crypto ecosystems open doors to collaboration and create complex ecosystems spanning multiple platforms. The top crypto ecosystems will hold immense significance in 2025 for several compelling reasons: Advanced technology Higher scalability and security Higher community support and engagement Real-world use cases List of top crypto ecosystems in 2025 POPG Ethereum Solana Polygon Ripple Toncoin Sui Network Dogecoin Chainlink Avalanche POPG ($POPG): Top emerging crypto ecosystem POPG is a unique web3 entertainment ecosystem focused on community-driven growth and sustainability. Its native token, $POPG, gives holders access to exclusive features, projects, and rewards across three key platforms: POP.VIP: Save $POPG and climb through VIP levels to unlock exciting rewards and gain exclusive access to premium events. POP.GAME: Use $POPG to dive into the thrilling world of POP.GAME, where token holders can actively influence the platform’s setup and future by sharing ideas and suggestions—all while ensuring a healthy, enjoyable experience for the community. POP.LIVE : Holders can use $POPG to secure exclusive & high-demand live events/concerts tickers at fair prices, setting it apart from traditional web3 entertainment. With a strong emphasis on fan empowerment and rewarding experiences, POPG invites everyone to get involved as it prepares for its upcoming centralized exchange listing. Stay updated by following them on X . Ethereum ($ETH) Ethereum is the leading crypto ecosystem in terms of market value and developer activity. It boasts a wide range of applications, many with their native tokens. One is tempted to examine the top tokens and applications when exploring the Ethereum ecosystem. These have robust user engagement, value creation mechanisms, and tokenomics. Notable mentions include: MakerDAO – Offers a decentralized alternative to asset-backed stablecoins. AAVE- A non-custodial liquidity protocol for borrowing and lending crypto assets. Uniswap – A decentralized crypto exchange Lido DAO – A liquid staking solution for Ethereum and other proof of stake tokens. Ethereum also comprises Layer 2 solutions, which are networks built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. These help reduce congestion and fees on the base layer. Examples include Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism, all with their thriving ecosystems. All fees on Layer 2 networks are settled in Ethereum’s native token, $ETH. $ETH is also a governance token and an incentive for nodes that secure the network. Solana ($SOL) Solana is famous for its high throughput exceeding Bitcoin and Ethereum’s. The blockchain was created in 2017 to provide a secure, fast, and scalable infrastructure for decentralized applications. Most activities in the Solana ecosystem are linked to its native token, $SOL. As a result, $SOL’s value tends to reflect the overall activity and growth of the Solana ecosystem. This relationship between network usage and token value is a notable aspect of Solana’s economic model. Some of the leading applications on the Solana ecosystem include: Serum – a lightning-fast decentralized exchange. Raydium – an automated market maker (AMM) with real-time network liquidity provisioning. Mango Markets – a cross-margin trading platform offering ultra-speed execution and DeFi’s decentralized ethos. Polygon ($POL) While most Ethereum ecosystem tokens, like $POL, have shown a correlation with Ethereum returns, this view oversimplifies the complex nature of these assets. Each Layer 2 ecosystem token has unique features and should be evaluated individually. When Polygon started, it sought to solve the blockchain trilemma introduced by Vitalik Buterin. In this effect, Polygon architecture focused on scalability while relying on Ethereum for security and decentralization. The original thesis has, of course, evolved. Therefore, Polygon is a key player in addressing Ethereum’s scalability issues. Its current total value locked (funds in the ecosystem) is $870M. Polygon boats a variety of decentralized applications that you can explore. These include borrowing and lending Dapps like AAVE and Compoud V3, decentralized exchanges like Uniswap and QuickswaP, and prediction markets like Polymarket. Ripple ($XRP) Ripple is an ecosystem that aims to interconnect all the world’s disparate financial systems by enabling frictionless money transfer using blockchain technology. The protocol runs on the XRP Ledger blockchain, allowing it to complete transactions quickly and cheaply. $XRP is the fuel of the Ripple ecosystem used to settle transaction fees and reward node operators who secure the network. The Ripple network, through its counterparty, RippleNet, offers more utilities, including: Processing cross-border transactions through fiat currencies Offering ample liquidity through its XRP token A standard interface that corporates can use to pay their members To this end, Ripple launched its stablecoin, Ripple USD ($RLUSD), whose value is pegged to and backed by the US dollar. With over a decade of experience at the intersection of finance and crypto and a proven track record working with regulators and policymakers globally, Ripple is accelerating the digital asset economy with $RLUSD. Toncoin ($TON) The Open Network (TON) ecosystem has tremendously grown over the last 12 months. TON was initially created by Telegram, so the current ecosystem remains closely integrated with the messaging platform. In April 2022, TON made a significant announcement that allowed Telegram users to make payments through the application. The Telegram integration has allowed the TON ecosystem to thrive, leading to the widespread use of on-chain gaming apps and bots with their native tokens built on TON. Another reason for TON’s popularity is its distinctive features. TON offers multi-chain architecture and asynchronous smart contract calls. $Toncoin is TON’s native cryptocurrency used for transactions, network operations, games, or collectibles. SUI Network ($SUI) The SUI network is modeled for instant transaction finality and high-speed transactions, making it the go-to option for gamers and other real-time applications. Other features that make the SUI ecosystem suitable for high-throughput applications include its object storage model. The model differs from other conventional ecosystems, which process transactions sequentially, limiting their scalability. SUI only processes relevant data, allowing its nodes to validate uncorrelated transaction flows independently and individually instead of having to order all transactions. The Mysticeti update in 2024 marked a significant milestone for the SUI ecosystem. The update enabled SUI to offer the lowest latency in the industry, approximately 400 milliseconds, an 80% improvement. The $SUI token fuels the SUI ecosystem. The token is used to settle transaction fees and can be used as a versatile liquid asset, a unit of account, and more complex operations enabled by smart contracts. Dogecoin ($DOGE) Unless you’ve just stumbled into the Web3 world or taken a digital detox in a cave somewhere, you’ve probably encountered Dogecoin. It is a coin based on a popular meme featuring a Shiba Inu, a Japanese dog breed. Doge has gradually established itself as a genuine crypto and a potential investment asset. Maybe you’ve even heard of $DOGE from key opinion leaders like Elon Musk. The Dogecoin code base is open source, meaning you can view or use its source code or participate in its development. The ecosystem is maintained by a community of users and developers, which has significantly grown over the years. This ecosystem is highly engaged in developing new applications for Dogecoin, from donations and charities to providing a fast, cheap, and reliable way for value transfer. Part of its support base also stems from the Dogecoin Foundation, a nonprofit organization that advocates for and supports the Dogecoin project. Dogecoin boasts a strong community and media coverage, which have propelled it to the top 10 cryptocurrencies in market value, which exceeded $46 billion at press time. Chainlink ($LINK) Chainlink is technically positioned to grow its ecosystem through high-profile integrations and collaborations. Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that connects quality of-chain data feeds with the blockchain. Oracles enable smart contracts to interact with real-world data. The Chainlink ecosystem now boasts over 2,000 projects and integrations, providing them with critical infrastructure that could entail: Integrating existing financial infrastructure with the blockchain while supporting institutional compliance. Enabling interoperability between blockchain infrastructure by enabling the accurate movement of assets across blockchains. Enabling innovation within decentralized finance by extending the possibilities to real-world applications. Recent high-profile partnerships in the Chainlink ecosystem include: Integration with Shiba Inu integration to enhance cross-chain functionality and scalability for its metaverse, Shibarium. A partnership with 21X to launch Europe’s first EU-regulated tokenized securities market scheduled for early 2025. The Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) selected Microsoft Brazil and Chainlink, among others, to build a trade finance solution as part of Brazil’s digital currency pilot. The solution will automate supply chain management and improve trade finance processes. Avalanche ($AVAX) The Avalanche ecosystem is somewhat akin to its competitors like Ethereum, Sui, and Solana. It is an ecosystem for Dapp developers, creators, and gamers. Developers can build their customized chains, called subnets, on the Avalanche blockchain for blockchain applications or enterprise solutions. The subnets are EVM compatible, meaning developers can easily migrate their Ethereum Dapps into Avalanche. $AVAX, the ecosystem’s native token, has gained significant traction in the market. It often ranks among the top 10 tokens by market capitalization, a testament to its growing utility and adoption. The Avalanche Foundation, the organization behind the Avalanche blockchain, fosters the development and support of decentralized applications (dApps) and Web3 projects on the blockchain. The foundation recently launched ‘the biggest network upgrade’ on Avalanche called Avalance9000 . The update cut costs and fees on Avalanche’s C-Chain, responsible for smart contracts and decentralized applications on the chain, by over 90%, a crucial step in the future development of the Avalanche ecosystem. However, Avalanche is not just for individual users and developers; it also offers significant opportunities in supply chain management, finance, digital identity verification, and asset tokenization. Conclusion Crypto ecosystems represent more than technological innovation; they signify the potential of communities to drive value in the Web3 space while they earn incentives in return. As the ecosystems grow, we anticipate their influence will expand as we move into the next phase of digital evolution.

This crash is mostly because of profit-taking among investors and the change of sentiment in the crypto industry. So, can the Official TRUMP price crash to $10? Tump Meme Coin Crashes As Whales Book Profits There are signs that the most profitable Official Trump traders have dumped their tokens. David Portnoy, the founder of Barstool Sports made a cool $1 million as he bought the surging coin and then dumped. On-chain data shows that the most profitable TRUMP token trader made $59 million and has already cashed out $44 million. The other trader made $53 million and has sold everything. The top 15 most profitable TRUMP meme coin holders have dumped tokens worth millions of dollars. TRUMP Meme Coin Profit Leaders Dumped This is a common scenario in the stock and crypto market, where smart money investors buy surging assets. They then sell early and leave many FOMO retail investors holding the bag. It has happened in most meme coins , most recently, with ai16z, the popular AI agent that surged and then collapsed. The TRUMP price also crashed as other cryptocurrencies fell. Bitcoin price has dropped from a record high of $109,200 to $102,000. Other meme coins like Shiba Inu and Pepe have all dropped sharply in the past few days. This decline is also because investors are selling the news since the coin jumped ahead of the inauguration, which has now happened. Can TRUMP Price Crash to $10? The 30-minute chart shows that the TRUMP price peaked at $75, where it created a double-top chart pattern with a neckline at $53. This pattern has twin peaks and is often a highly bearish chart pattern. TRUMP price has formed a small rising wedge chart pattern, another negative sign in technical analysis. This wedge happened after the token fell sharply, a sign that it is forming a bearish flag pattern. Therefore, there is a risk that the sell-off will continue in the near term as investors wait for crypto policy announcements. A bearish breakdown could see it crash to the next pivotal support point at $21.45, its lowest level on January 18. TRUMP price will drop to $10 if it moves below that support level. TRUMP Price chart Conversely, a move above the double-top’s neckline at $54 will invalidate the bearish view and push it to a record high. Trump’s Lack of Crypto Mention Hints More Crash Ahead Another possible catalyst for the Trump price crash is the fact that Donald Trump did not mention crypto in his inaugural speech as many investors were expecting. He also did not sign any crypto-related executive order on Monday. That could be a sign that cryptocurrencies may continue falling in the near term.

The discourse touches on real-world applications of trending AI tokens, heartwarming and inspiring tales of community triumph, and culminates in their ambitious visions for 2025 and beyond. “AI has basked in glamor in the past year. We are keeping it real in Web3 by introducing it to the ruthless and chaotic energy of meme culture,” says MK Chin, Bybit Web3 Evangelist. “Expect plenty of ‘neural network walks into a bar’ jokes and maybe even AI Web3 mishaps that are too good not to share.” To sign up for the livestream, users may visit the event page for a chance to debate and win AI tokens. #Bybit / #TheCryptoArk / #BybitWeb3 About Bybit Web3 Bybit Web3 is redefining openness in the decentralized world, creating a simpler, open, and equal ecosystem for everyone.

With its long-standing focus on compliance, Bitstamp is one of a select group of crypto trading platforms to hold a Markets in Financial Instruments ( MiFID ) license, a pan-European regulatory framework for trading securities and derivatives, which was amended in 2022 to encompass crypto assets. “With its MiFID license in Europe, Bitstamp plans to launch a fully regulated perpetual swap offering,” one of the people said. The arrival of regulatory clarity in Europe, when it comes to crypto and tokens, has prompted the planned introduction of crypto derivatives trading from firms holding MiFID II licenses, such as Point72 Ventures-backed D2X , and Backpack Exchange , which is in the process of acquiring the remains of FTX EU and its licenses. The vast majority of crypto derivatives volume is offshore and the aim of these new entrants is to shift market dominance away from the likes of Panama-based centralized exchange Deribit. In June of last year, it was announced that fintech giant Robinhood would be acquiring Bitstamp , whose future looks bright, not only in Europe but also in the U.S. where it holds multiple state licenses, including a coveted New York State BitLicense.

The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) is urging swift action from crypto firms to restrict non-compliant stablecoins, signaling a firm stance on regulatory alignment. Meanwhile, Gemini, the crypto exchange founded by the Winklevoss twins, is establishing a compliance hub in Malta to strengthen its foothold in Europe and meet MiCA’s stringent requirements. ESMA Pushes for Urgent Restrictions on Non-MiCA-Compliant Stablecoins The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU’s financial markets regulator, has issued a call to action for firms handling stablecoins that do not meet the requirements of the European Union's Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation ( MiCA ). This significant regulatory move, announced on Jan. 17, highlights the EU’s firm stance on ensuring compliance with its groundbreaking crypto legislation. In a statement addressing asset-referenced tokens (ARTs) and electronic money tokens (EMTs), commonly referred to as stablecoins, the ESMA urged crypto asset service providers (CASPs) to act swiftly to align with MiCA guidelines. The regulator emphasized the critical role of national competent authorities (NCAs) in steering CASPs through compliance processes, signaling that adherence to MiCA's requirements is a high priority. The MiCA framework, designed to create a harmonized regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies across the EU, explicitly prohibits the offering or trading of stablecoins that are not issued by authorized entities. It also requires written consent from issuers for any offerings or listings, reinforcing stringent oversight. The ESMA set a definitive timeline for compliance, mandating that CASPs restrict services for non-compliant stablecoins ”as soon as possible” but no later than the end of the first quarter of 2025. However, CASPs will be allowed to offer limited ”sell-only” services for such stablecoins until March 31, 2025, providing EU investors an opportunity to liquidate or convert their holdings. The regulator’s push for an earlier deadline—January 31, 2025—for the complete restriction of existing services indicates the urgency of aligning with MiCA standards. ESMA’s statement also highlights the critical role of NCAs in enforcing these regulations, showing the importance of a coordinated effort across EU member states. Tether’s USDT, the largest stablecoin by market capitalization, has emerged as a key focal point of the ESMA’s directive. According to Juan Ignacio Ibañez, a member of the MiCA Crypto Alliance’s Technical Committee, USDT is classified as a non-compliant asset under MiCA. As Tether lacks the required MiCA license, exchanges and CASPs operating within the EU may be compelled to delist USDT by the end of January 2025. Ibañez further noted that no trace of USDT should remain, not even in a “sell-only” capacity, by March 31, 2025. This development raises significant questions about the future availability of USDT within the EU market. In response, a Tether spokesperson acknowledged the evolving regulatory landscape under MiCA and its potential implications for the stablecoin market. The representative added that many exchanges are engaging with local NCAs to address regulatory concerns, while Tether users are unlikely to experience immediate disruptions as discussions progress. Industry Uncertainty and Concerns Despite the ESMA’s efforts to clarify regulatory requirements, confusion persists among industry stakeholders regarding the practical implementation of MiCA’s stablecoin provisions. Some executives, such as Gemini’s head of Europe, have pointed out ambiguities in the legislation, adding to the challenges faced by CASPs and stablecoin issuers alike. The ESMA’s directive also raises broader questions about the impact of MiCA on the stablecoin market, particularly as issuers and service providers navigate the complexities of regulatory compliance. Industry players are now racing against the clock to align their operations with MiCA , while national regulators work to ensure consistent enforcement across the EU. The ESMA’s push for compliance marks a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry in Europe. By enforcing strict guidelines for stablecoins, the EU aims to bolster investor protection, reduce risks, and foster a more transparent and accountable crypto ecosystem. However, the impending restrictions on major stablecoins like USDT could also lead to significant market shifts, with potential disruptions for CASPs and users alike. As the March 2025 deadline approaches, the industry will be closely watching the responses of key players and the regulatory measures taken by NCAs. Whether MiCA’s implementation will achieve its intended goals of harmonization and market stability remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: the era of unregulated stablecoins in the EU is coming to an end. Gemini Establishes MiCA Compliance Hub in Malta to Expand European Operations In related news, Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange founded by the Winklevoss twins, is making significant strides in aligning with Europe’s evolving crypto regulations by setting up a dedicated compliance hub in Malta. This move is part of Gemini's commitment to adhering to the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework, a groundbreaking regulatory initiative set to reshape the continent's crypto landscape. Gemini’s decision to establish its European compliance hub in Malta was announced on Jan. 20, following the company’s receipt of its sixth Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) registration from the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) in December 2024. The exchange now holds VASP licenses in six European countries: Malta, France, Ireland, Spain, Italy, and Greece. These licenses enable Gemini to provide regulated crypto services across the EU. Mark Jennings, Gemini’s head of Europe, said that Malta’s proactive approach to supporting fintech innovation was a key factor behind the decision. While establishing its presence in Malta is a critical step forward, Gemini has yet to secure a MiCA license. Jennings explained that obtaining the license involves either filing a new application in a chosen jurisdiction or transitioning existing VASP licenses into MiCA compliance during the regulatory framework’s transition period. Gemini Intergalactic EU, the exchange’s European arm, secured its VASP license in Malta on Dec. 16, 2024. This milestone is expected to serve as a foundation for the eventual attainment of full MiCA compliance. Jennings emphasized the importance of building a scalable and compliant infrastructure to meet MiCA’s rigorous requirements. One of the most significant challenges in aligning with MiCA regulations has been creating a unified and compliant infrastructure across Europe. Before MiCA, regulatory requirements varied widely between countries like France, Spain, and Italy, complicating customer onboarding and operational processes. MiCA’s Impact on the European Crypto Landscape MiCA, expected to be fully implemented by 2025, is designed to harmonize cryptocurrency regulations across the EU, providing greater transparency and stability to the market. For Gemini, this clarity is a significant step forward in addressing customer concerns and driving the adoption of crypto services. “From our perspective, MiCA brings much-needed regulatory certainty, which is crucial for customers who have been waiting for clear guidelines,” Jennings remarked. However, he acknowledged that some uncertainties remain, particularly regarding the treatment of certain stablecoins under MiCA. Stablecoins, a cornerstone of the crypto ecosystem, have faced mixed reactions under MiCA regulations. While issuers like Circle have secured approval for their USDC stablecoin, others, such as Tether, have resisted MiCA’s requirements. This has led to speculation about the potential delisting of Tether’s USDT in the EU as a non-compliant asset. Jennings noted that stablecoin regulation under MiCA remains a complex issue.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|USDT|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-21 14:00:00

Analyst Reveals Critical Levels To Watch For A Pump Or Crash,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-price-to-breakout-to-1-4/,"The Dogecoin price is at a critical juncture as a crypto analyst has pinpointed key price levels that could dictate its next significant move upwards. With the number one meme coin currently trading above $0.34, the analyst predicts a breakout to $1.4 if bullish conditions stay favorable and a price crash to new lows if Dogecoin fails to reach a critical level. Dogecoin Price: Will It Pump Or Crash? According to a TradingView crypto analyst known as ‘Mindbloome-Trading,’ the Dogecoin price is on the verge of an exponential pump that will push its value above the coveted $1 mark. The crypto expert presented a video chart analysis, highlighting $0.46 as a crucial resistance level for Dogecoin. This price point aligns with the 0.382 Fibonacci level, which is often a significant barrier in technical analysis. Related Reading: Machine Learning Algorithm Predicts Dogecoin Price From January To December 2025 The TradingView market expert has suggested that if Dogecoin surpasses the $0.46 resistance level, it could ignite a rally that propels the meme coin to its next bullish target at $1.4. Such a move would likely be driven by increased demand and buying pressure from investors. Conversely, the analyst shared a bearish outlook for Dogecoin. He indicated that if Dogecoin fails to maintain the support level at $0.3, the meme coin could be at risk of a severe decline. He predicts a DOGE price crash to a lower support level at $0.23, achieving new price lows not seen since 2024. Falling back to the $0.23 level could send bearish signals to the market, potentially leading to increased selling pressure and more declines. The analyst has revealed that Dogecoin is currently in a support phase, and its next price movements could determine the direction of its future value. While the TradingView crypto expert shares his bullish and bearish price forecast for Dogecoin, his detailed video chart shows Dogecoin’s price movements from 2020 to 2024, highlighting key peaks and troughs that indicate past volatility. The chart also pinpoints key support and resistance zones using Fibonacci extension and retracement levels to predict the meme coin’s next price level. What’s Driving Dogecoin’s Current Trend? The Dogecoin price is currently experiencing severe downside momentum despite multiple bullish forecasts suggesting an imminent rally. The major factors driving Dogecoin’s bullish sentiment in the crypto market are the recent inauguration of Donald Trump as the new President of the United States (US) and the influence of SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who has established the new Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) unit. Related Reading: Can The Dogecoin Price Rally For 3 Months Straight? 2021 Bull Market Performance Says Yes Despite expectations of a bull run, Dogecoin has declined by 9.64% in one day to trade at $0.34, according to CoinMarketCap. Nevertheless, analysts on the popular X social media platform remain bullish, forecasting significant price increases in the future. One notable prediction by crypto analyst and Dogecoin supporter David Butler suggests that the popular meme coin could rally by 100X to reach $34. While this projection may seem rather ambitious, the analyst is confident that a price increase to this level is inevitable.

Yet, experts say that a round two stake in the altcoin in question (PCHAIN) might end up being the most lucrative financial investment in 2025. With Trump’s administration expected to spark a massive Q1 bull run, the PCHAIN price is set to explode as the PropiChain project compels investors with its Web3 + AI solutions for the $634 trillion real estate industry. The Dogecoin Price Soars, But DOGE is Not the Answer With the DOGE price up over the past day (3.06%), week (18.28%), and month (9.14%) to $0.3996, many were surprised when one Dogecoin millionaire pointed to another utility altcoin as the best crypto to buy now. But upon closer inspection, this shift from Dogecoin (DOGE) may prove to be a smart financial move. That’s because the coming bull run is set to mimic the last one, where government and institutional interest in utility tokens saw altcoins like XRP, SOL, and ETH dominate the cycle. Yet, while these tokens are frontrunners to yield the biggest profits in the coming cycle, their established natures offer gains that pale in comparison to PropiChain’s (PCHAIN) 50,000% growth potential. PCHAIN is not only overshadowing Dogecoin (DOGE), Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and Ethereum (ETH) but is set to outperform most of the crypto market in 2025. PCHAIN AI Altcoin Attracts 133,335% Potential from Real Estate Revolution This Dogecoin millionaire declaration of PropiChain (PCHAIN) as the ultimate AI AI altcoin to watch in 2025 sent shockwaves through the crypto community. But with the PropiChain presale already surpassing $2.3 million in funding in record time, it seems many investors silently share the same sentiment. This overwhelming optimism stems from PropiChain’s groundbreaking fusion of blockchain, artificial intelligence, RWA tokenization, the metaverse, and smart contracts. Together, these technologies are set to disrupt the $600 trillion real estate industry, solving its most difficult challenges with unparalleled efficiency. At the forefront is blockchain’s unmatched ability to combat property fraud. By securing tokenized real estate assets on an unbreachable vault and preserving transaction histories with complete transparency, PropiChain offers a trustless system that revolutionizes asset ownership. Yet, a growing number of investors are instead compelled by the platform’s innovative use of AI to redefine real estate investing. Imagine accurately predicting market trends before they unfold, instantly pinpointing the ideal property from millions of options, and assessing asset values with a precision that eclipses traditional methods – all while automating trades on your behalf. This is not just a promise; it’s the future PropiChain delivers to PCHAIN holders at no additional cost. PropiChain’s AI goes beyond surface-level data analysis, delving into factors like projected price changes, economic conditions, and demand shifts for specific property types. Automatic Valuation Models (AVMs) further enhance accuracy by considering historical sales, property attributes, and macroeconomic trends, enabling buyers and sellers to make informed decisions effortlessly. PropiChain’s AI is ushering in a new world of real estate investing where anyone can confidently make profitable decisions. However, beyond AI innovation, PropiChain is once again transforming the real estate industry by democratizing participation with fractional ownership – a feature allowing investors to trade shares of any property in unlimited fractions. Picture owning a 0.1% share of a $1 million real estate asset in Malibu with just $1,000. Paired with a dynamic metaverse marketplace where users can explore, trade, and interact with properties globally, PropiChain is poised to redefine real estate as we know it, ushering in a new era of accessibility and profitability. PropiChain (PCHAIN) Beats Dogecoin (DOGE) as the Best Altcoin to Buy in 2025 While Dogecoin (DOGE) still dominates as the top meme coin to hold, its gains in the coming cycle pale in comparison to major utility altcoins. Specifically, the PropiChain AI altcoin trumps today’s investment in Dogecoin, as PCHAIN prepares for a market-outperforming 133,335% rise compared to DOGE eyeing 250-400% gains. Investors Race to Presale as PCHAIN Sells Out at Lowest Price When we discuss millionaire-minting altcoins, there’s no one in a better position to understand than a Dogecoin millionaire who profited from the DOGE boom. And now, with this whale pointing to PropiChain (PCHAIN) as the next crypto to make life-changing gains in 2025, the market cannot help but pay attention. In truth, PropiChain is set to mirror the 100,000%+ 2020-2021 Dogecoin rally with a 133,335% run for PCHAIN in 2025. With this profit potential, a round-two investment PropiChain presale can realistically transform a modest $750 investment into $1 million by EOY. It’s difficult to express how rare this is, even for the crypto world, with many notable tokens that have recorded explosive growth. For investors, this opportunity to acquire PCHAIN at its $0.011 (its lowest-ever price) and make explosive gains is unmissable, as evidenced by the massive presale participation, with millions staked in the past weeks. With news of the PropiChain BlockAudit security audit and the PCHAIN CoinMarketCap listing only drawing more traffic, delaying will mean losing out on what could be the biggest financial opportunity of 2025. This is especially true as round three comes with a 108% price hike that cuts the profit potential with PCHAIN by more than half.

Armstrong attended the World Economic Forum at Davos where he participated in a panel discussion. One key highlight underlined by the exchange CEO was Bitcoin achieving its all-time high value in recent hours. Brian Armstrong Bullish About Crypto Investments Coinbase CEO, Brian Armstrong, participated in a panel discussion of the World Economic Forum that happened in Davos. He said that the second term of Donald Trump is very likely to bring investments in crypto, adding that his effect on the crypto market is undeniable. Brian Armstrong has based his confidence in the Trump Administration after Donald Trump said that he wanted to become the first crypto president. ‘To have a leader of the largest GDP country in the world come out undeniably and say that he wants to be the first crypto president”, Brian said. He then added, as per a report by Reuters , that it would be Legislation in Congress that would bring a lot of new investments to cryptocurrencies. Coinbase CEO emphasized that the recent ATH in the value of Bitcoin was largely due to the inauguration of Donald Trump. His comments come despite the rising uncertainty and volatility in the crypto market. Also, there was no key executive crypto order mentioned on the first day of Donald Trump as the US President. Market Sentiment Remains Mixed The highest that the Bitcoin price reached in the last 24 hours was $107,663.3 before retracing back to $104,130.85, which is still an increase of 149.49% over the past year. BTC prices have been gaining traction since the announcement of the US Presidential election results in November last year. Besides, the recent comment from the Coinbase CEO has further fueled market sentiments. Source: CoinMarketCap DOGE is another cryptocurrency that has gained significant upticks since November last year. Dogecoin tokens were trading around $0.1931 before they climbed to 0.3759, up by 330.26% over the past year. Most notably, it is the TRUMP meme coin which is making rounds across the crypto market. The Solana meme coin has gained 445.73% since its launch and is exchanging hands at $37.24. It is now speculated that the TRUMP meme coin may breach $54 milestone. World Economic Forum at Davos World Economic Forum at Davos is largely a gathering of influential personalities from several industries, allowing them to expand their networks and share their insights. Apart from the Coinbase CEO, speakers that are expected to share their thoughts are David Rubenstein, Ray Dalio, and others. Donald Trump is also expected to make an appearance through video conference. The statement from Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong at such a huge platform has sent signals that there is certainly a reason for the crypto community to stay bullish about its future. However, it is still recommended to consider risk and volatility before investing in cryptocurrencies.

Multiple analysts and predictions have presented Chainlink price prediction to $50. However, it fails on various levels, where short-term price consolidation affects its long-term trajectory. However, the $20M withdrawal from the crypto exchange presents a bullish signal. Let’s discuss what this means for the Chainlink token and its long-term trajectory. 770K LINK Withdrawn From Exchanges Amid Chainlink Price Consolidation According to the Santiment feed , around 770,000 LINKs have moved from crypto exchanges to individual wallets today. At the current Chainlink price of $25.90, these 770,000 LINKs come to $20M. The token faced consolidation around Donald Trump inauguration , resulting in the price drop. However, it is attempting to recover at press time. Given rising investor confidence, this increased withdrawal from crypto exchanges represents a bullish outlook. A separate report mentions a surge in the Chainlink whale accumulation. In the last 24 hours, $7.3 million LINK was added to whales’ portfolios, boosting the token’s demand. The whale accumulation and investor internet directly hint at the token’s long-term potential, and there’s more. WLFI LINK Buying & Cardano Partnerships Hint At Recovery Donald Trump’s crypto project, World Liberty Financial , is another bullish factor in the LINK price recovery. The crypto project has again added $4.6M tokens to its portfolio, bringing the total to 256.3k Chainlink tokens holdings. The first time it invested in LINK, its value surged 30%. WLFI also invested in five other cryptocurrencies for their broader market perspective, which could also influence their prices. This blockchain abstraction layer is gaining additional attention in the market. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has hinted at a possible partnership with Chainlink. If this happens, it could open new possibilities with DeFi and RWA tokenization and much more, which could influence their demand and price in the market. How Will Chainlink Price Move Next? The demand for Chainlink is persistent, and many factors support its bullish trajectory. The four-hour charts show a breakout above $22.87, a key resistance level that aligns with the March high. As the LINK price has already crossed the resistance, currently trading at $25.90, a crypto analyst highlights the formation of a cup and handle, which is a bullish pattern. As a result, the analyst predicts that the price will move between $25 and $29 before facing any resistance. However, if the momentum fails to build, Chainlink can decline to the $21-$22 range. Bottom Line Considering its growing adoption and demand, crypto whales and institutional traders are eyeing the recovery of the Chainlink price. The token’s price entered the consolidation phase after a long surge. However, the increased exchange withdrawals and wale holding fueled the recovery. Today, 770,000 LINK, equivalent to $20M, moved from exchanges, showing investor confidence. Among these bullish factors, the LINK price could rally to $50 in the long term and $29 in the short term. However, failure to maintain the uptrend can result in further consolidation.

According to a Jan. 21 Sonex press release, the firm closed the seed round in under 60 days. Outliers Fund and an anonymous investor co-led the funding round, which included Baboon VC, Taisu Ventures, Nonagon Capital, Flow Traders, Gate Ventures, and Lootex. Lastly, the seed round also received capital from previously announced partners. The newly raised funds will be used to further develop Sonex’s technical infrastructure and launch new features, including derivatives trading and peer-to-peer trading pools. The company will also leverage the new capital to bolster security measures and expand operational capacity to accommodate growing user demands. Lastly, new resources will also allow to better market Sonex to attract a broader user base and to research potential features and ecosystem integrations. Sonex CEO Kai explained that the project’s greatest innovation is the integration of AI-driven agents into its trading ecosystem: “It’s a strategic evolution that empowers our users to harness advanced AI capabilities for better decision-making and enhanced trading experiences. With the support of our investors, we are excited to lead the charge in making decentralized finance more dynamic and accessible”. Takashi Hayashida, Founder and Managing Partner of Taisu Ventures, said the firm is “immensely optimistic” about Soneium’s future.

The AI altcoin PropiChain is emerging as Binance insiders’ top pick, promising an unprecedented 50,000% ROI by Q2 2025. Unlike speculative tokens, PropiChain’s focus on artificial intelligence and real-world applications makes it a strong contender in the competitive crypto space. PEPE vs. PropiChain: Why Binance Insiders Are Shifting Focus PEPE , a meme coin that rose to fame for its viral popularity, has garnered significant attention. While its early adopters saw incredible gains, many insiders believe its peak performance may be behind it. Meme coins like PEPE often lack intrinsic value, which can hinder long-term growth. On the other hand, PropiChain offers real-world utility through its AI-driven solutions, targeting the massive real estate industry. This innovative AI altcoin is equipped with features that directly benefit investors, making it a strategic choice over speculative coins. PropiChain: Redefining Real Estate Investments with AI PropiChain isn’t just another crypto project; it’s an AI-powered platform designed to transform the trillion-dollar real estate market. With its cutting-edge technology, PropiChain provides investors with tools to make smarter, data-driven decisions, enhancing their potential for higher returns. Here are the unique features that make PCHAIN appear as Binance’s pick: 1. AI-Driven Market Analysis PropiChain’s AI algorithms analyze real estate trends, predicting market movements and identifying undervalued properties. This allows investors to capitalize on opportunities with minimal risk. For instance, the platform’s market analysis tools can flag emerging property hotspots, ensuring investors are ahead of the curve. 2. Automated Property Valuation Accurate property valuation has always been a challenge for real estate investors. PropiChain’s AI technology evaluates numerous variables; location, market conditions, property features, and nearby developments; to provide precise and instant valuations. This eliminates guesswork, enabling investors to make informed offers that maximize profitability without overpaying. 3. Fractional Ownership With PropiChain, owning a share of high-value properties is no longer reserved for the wealthy. Its real estate tokenization feature enables fractional ownership, allowing investors to diversify their portfolios with minimal capital. For example, instead of needing $1 million to invest in a luxury apartment, you can own a fractional share for as little as $500, diversifying your portfolio without stretching your finances. 4. Metaverse Integration PropiChain’s metaverse capabilities set it apart from traditional real estate platforms. Features like virtual property tours, virtual staging, and AR/VR-enhanced meetings create a seamless experience for buyers and sellers. These tools enhance property promotion, enabling sellers to showcase assets globally while providing buyers with detailed insights before committing. Buyer Benefits : Buyers can explore properties in detail from anywhere in the world, making better decisions without incurring travel costs. Seller Benefits : Sellers, including agencies and individual property owners, can showcase properties to a global audience, significantly boosting visibility and sale potential. 5. Property Filtering and Suggestions PropiChain’s advanced AI can filter properties based on your investment goals, budget, and preferences. If you are a buyer seeking high-yield rental opportunities or properties in emerging markets, the platform’s smart suggestion system ensures you don’t miss out on hidden gems. An investor looking for properties with the highest short-term rental potential can receive customized options that align perfectly with their goals. Investor Benefits: Why PropiChain is a Game-Changer PropiChain isn’t just about innovation, it’s about delivering tangible benefits to its investors: Higher ROI Through Smart Decisions : By using AI tools, investors can identify profitable properties and minimize losses. Accessibility for Small-Scale Investors : Fractional ownership democratizes real estate, allowing anyone to participate in high-value investments. Global Reach : The metaverse integration connects buyers and sellers worldwide, streamlining property transactions and marketing efforts. If you invest $1,000 today that investment could grow to $500,000 by Q2 2025, if PropiChain achieves its projected 50,000% growth. PropiChain Presale: A Limited-Time Opportunity PropiChain is currently in stage 2 of its presale, priced at $0.011. By stage 3, the price is set to rise to $0.023, making now the perfect time to invest. Listed on CoinMarketCap and backed by a BlockAudit security review , PropiChain has earned the trust of the crypto community. This presale stage represents the lowest entry price investors will ever see. Once the token hits mainstream exchanges, early adopters are likely to see explosive gains. Conclusion With Binance insiders backing the crypto AI trend and PropiChain leading the charge, the project’s potential is undeniable. This is more than just a cryptocurrency, it’s a platform that empowers investors to achieve financial freedom. With projections of a 50,000% ROI by Q2 2025, early adopters could turn small investments into generational wealth. Don’t miss your chance to join the next big crypto movement. Secure your PropiChain tokens now, and watch your portfolio soar.

Coinbase CEO Explains!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/how-will-trumps-second-presidency-affect-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrencies-coinbase-ceo-explains/,"Even though Donald Trump did not mention Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies in his first speech, his official inauguration as president was met with great enthusiasm in the cryptocurrency world. While the number of people expecting positive change in the cryptocurrency sector increases with the inauguration of Trump, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong evaluated Donald Trump's inauguration and its effects in his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Speaking to CNBC's Squawk Box program in Davos, Coinbase CEO said that Trump's second term as US president will attract a lot of investment in cryptocurrencies. Armstrong, who stated that Trump's two administrations could introduce new rules for cryptocurrencies in the US, said that crypto legislation to be passed by Congress could pave the way for major investments: “The Trump effect is undeniable. The fact that the leader of the country with the largest GDP in the world has undeniably come out and said he wants to be the first crypto president is very positive for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. The industry is ready for this new change, ready for clear rules. And our next big move is to ensure that some laws are passed in the US to make this even clearer. At this point, cryptocurrencies in the US will now be regulated by new rules and new investments will come to this area with the laws that will be passed by Congress. Armstrong also noted that Bitcoin's recent rise to an all-time high was largely due to Trump's inauguration, adding that former US President Joe Biden and his administration created a hostile environment for cryptocurrencies. *This is not investment advice.

Additional enthusiasm concerns Gary General’s resignation from the SEC and Mark Uyeda’s becoming the acting Chairman. This regulatory change provides the perfect opportunity to explore crypto with high growth potential. Let’s discuss five crypto to buy with the new Chairman. Donald Trump Hires Mark Uyeda As The Acting SEC Chairman After Gary Gensler’s resignation, Mark Uyeda became the acting Chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Before this, he was the Republican commissioner from June 2022. Interestingly, he has openly criticized the SEC and Gensler’s stringent approach to the crypto industry. Uyeda also emphasized the need to develop clear and practical guidelines for the crypto industry. This is why his selection by the 47th US President selection has excited crypto investors. Interestingly, Uyeda has also commented on the Staff Accounting Bulletin 121. Overall, his positive approach toward the industry has earned investors’ attention. Mark Uyeda could significantly influence the entire crypto market, so buying trending altcoins could be a good idea. 5 Crypto To Buy Now Macroeconomic events often play a significant role in influencing the price of digital assets due to their high impact on investors’ sentiments. A prime example is Donald Trump’s inauguration event, which boosted the price of Bitcoin to a new ATH. However, past that, a significant consolidation took over the market, which analysts call the buying opportunity. Investors can consider these five crypto to buy based on their demand and long-term price potential. These are: – 1. XRP After Trump’s win in the US election, XRP entered one of the biggest bullish rallies in the market. It is currently trading at $3.14, making it the third-biggest crypto after this. Recent reports reveal US banks may collaborate with the Ripple token for international transactions . The token is growing with global adoption, and Mark Uyeda and any crypto-friendly chairman could influence its price even more due to its struggles with Gary Gensler. 2. Chainlink Chainlink is gaining investors’ attention due to its adoption and recent price rally. At present, the Cardano-Chainlink collaboration is under discussion and could influence the entire DeFi industry. Moreover, analysts see LINK price hitting $50 in the long term, driven by whale accumulation and bullish pattern formation. 3. Dogecoin Dogecoin, the most famous meme coin, is on investors’ radar as the crypto to buy due to its price being influenced by the Tesla owner. A recent comment by Elon Musk, “ DOGE To Mars ,” is speculated to push this crypto to new highs. However, the bullish trajectory may vary, as the DOGE here represents the Department of Government efficiency, not meme coin. 4. Shiba Inu The Dogecoin and Shiba Inu communities have constantly pushed these cryptos’ demand in the market. Recently, Mark Cuban praised SHIBA community , which kept the token relevant to the market, where other meme coins failed. Many industry experts agree, leading its placement in crypto to buy suggestions. 5. Pepe Coin Pepe Coin was the most bullish meme–themed cryptocurrency in 2024, with continuous gains. Just a month ago, the token surged to a new high. Recently, it caught the attention of the Ethereum founder, Vitalik Buterin , who bought 508.6M PEPE. Its historical bullish performance and industry demand could lead to further gains. What’s In There For You? Within just three weeks in 2025, Bitcoin price achieved a new ATH of $109.K, Donald Trump and FLOTUS launched meme coins, Gary Gensler resigned, and Mark Uyeda became the new SEC Chairman. However, experts believe this is the beginning, as Bitcoin bull run , altcoin season, and much more are in queue for this year. At present, the crypto market has entered a minor consolidation, which experts regard as an opportunity. However, among millions of cryptocurrencies, investors should strategically invest. The best five crypto buy options are XRP, Chainlink, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe Coin. However, investors must conduct proper analysis and research before investing.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Intel Markets becomes essential for investors seeking high returns amid an 811% surge. Traders should check out this opportunity, as others have abandoned DOGE, XRP for it. Table of Contents Intel Markets soars 811%, community grows more excited Ali: Price of DOGE could reach $15 Expert says XRP looks ready for the next run Conclusion The crypto arena is buzzing right now, with all the attention on Intel Markets (INTL), whose presale performance is off the charts. With a big price jump of 811% and over $7m collected, Intel Markets is the most talked-about topic among investors looking to find the next big crypto coin. Even the loyal followers of Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ripple (XRP) are shifting their focus to this emerging star, now in phase nine of its presale. Although market analysts like Ali and Scofield have made bold price predictions for DOGE and XRP, more traders are rushing to INTL as it could have higher upside potential this year. Intel Markets soars 811%, community grows more excited As Dogecoin and Ripple are showing green price charts right now, Intel Markets is also making headlines. Interest in this project is rising as it may redefine crypto trading. Intel Markets aims to do this by launching the first trading platform powered by AI technology. Users will experience features that do not exist elsewhere. For instance, while most trading robots repeat the same mistakes twice, the IntelMarkets Intelli-M™ trading robots will be self-learning. This means they will improve their performance over time. Plus, up to 1000x leverage on capital could maximize trader rewards while minimizing risks. At the heart of this platform will lie the INTL token, now in its presale. Holding this crypto coin will give users governance voting rights and discounts on trading fees. Thus, over 6m INTL tokens were sold in phase nine of its presale alone. Currently, it costs just $0.082, which is an 811% rise from its starting price of $0.009. However, phase ten will bring another jump to $0.091. Moreover, everyone is waiting for a Tier-1 CEX to list INTL and bring its value to $0.11.

CoinMarketCap shows that its value has jumped from around $0.30 to over $0.40 in the past week alone. In other words, nearly a 20% increase in the Dogecoin price in just a few short days, as per CoinMarkeCap. Crypto analyst Ali also remains optimistic for Dogecoin. In a recent X post, he said that this meme coin is trading inside a multi-year ascending parallel channel that could lead to a $15 price. This Dogecoin price prediction has turned some heads in the market. However, the Dogecoin market cap is $54b, which means it will need a lot of new money for its price to surge. Crypto coins like INTL will not face this issue, making many investors turn to them instead. Expert says XRP looks ready for the next run XRP is one of the top altcoins right now. In the past seven days, the price of Ripple surged nearly 40% as per CoinMarketCap. During that time, its value has moved from around $2.40 to over $3.30. Not only that, market experts like Scofield have excited traders with their Ripple (XRP) statements. According to his X post, this crypto coin looks ready for the next run. As a Ripple price prediction, he mentioned the $4 level. Nevertheless, many traders are still cautious about the Ripple crypto. Since it has surged nearly 500% in the past 12 months, it may have passed its highest upswings. Because of this, they are looking at INTL for potential profits. Conclusion Intel Markets has established itself as one of the most explosive crypto coins in presale, offering unbeatable returns to early investors. Things are getting exciting as the presale enters its final phases, and the anticipation builds around the Tier-1 exchange listing. Since it will also have a smaller market cap than Dogecoin and Ripple, its value will rise much faster with less money. Intel Markets may also dominate the crypto trading space with its unique AI-powered smart trading platform, so market analysts remain bullish on its long-term growth potential. Thus, they predict a potential 5x surge for this altcoin in 2025. To learn more about Intel Markets, visit the presale website , Telegram , and Twitter .

The Zug, Switzerland-based company is conducting a strategic review after receiving a number of inquiries from large global exchanges, crypto platforms and traditional finance (TradFi) institutions including banks and trading platforms, CEO and co-founder Olga Feldmeier told CoinDesk in an interview. The European Union's Markets in Crypto Asset (MiCA) rules came into force on Dec. 30, and Smart Valor could be a target for companies that don't have regulatory approval in Europe. While neither Switzerland nor Lichtenstein, where Smart Valor's retail crypto exchange is regulated, are members of the bloc, they belong to the European Economic Area (EEA) and can adopt MiCA. Liechtenstein's law to do so comes into force Feb. 1. “Our ultimate goal is to find the best strategy for growing stakeholder value while leveraging the resurgence of the crypto market and the benefits of enhanced regulation,"" Feldmeier said in an email. The firm has mandated investment banking firm Imperii Partners to explore potential opportunities, she said. The Swiss company could be an attractive acquisition for large exchanges, borrow and lend platforms, wealth management firms and retail brokerages. Advisers are running an auction with bids due by Jan. 24, two people familiar with the matter said. Several companies are expected to bid for the regulated exchange business, with a few more completing due diligence that could also join the auction, said the people, who spoke of condition of anonymity as the matter is private. At least one publicly listed company is also expected to join the bidding, one person said. Smart Valor was founded in 2017 and services both retail clients and banks. It has three units: The licensed retail crypto exchange, a business that sells exchange technology to banks and an artificial intelligence-driven investment platform called Elann.AI. A data room was set up before Christmas for would-be suitors to conduct due diligence, according to the people familiar. The company conducted an oversubscribed initial public offering in 2022 and its stock was listed on the Nasdaq First North Growth Market in Stockholm, becoming one of the first publicly listed crypto companies in the region.

Hyperliquid ( HYPE ) token rose by over 10% on January 12, even as other popular cryptocurrency prices declined. The token reached $23.10, its highest level since Sunday. The surge is likely due to Hyperliquid’s dominant market share in the futures trading industry. According to DefiLlama , the network has processed over $747 billion in futures trades since its inception. Its 24-hour volume stood at $12 billion, bringing its seven-day total to $73 billion. This makes it significantly larger than Jupiter ( JUP ), the second-biggest player in the industry, which handled $2.61 billion in the last 24 hours and $11.65 billion over the past week. On Monday, Hyperliquid’s daily volume reached a record high of $22 billion—an impressive leap from the $640 million it handled on the same day last year. All-time highs two days in a row: Hyperliquid reached >$22B in 24h volume pic.twitter.com/KSV0dvKmZm — Hyperliquid (@HyperliquidX) January 21, 2025 This increase was largely driven by the surging volume of newly launched meme coins like Official Trump ( TRUMP ) and Melania ( MELANIA ). These two tokens achieved multi-billion dollar market caps ahead of Donald Trump’s inauguration . You might also like: Official Trump meme coin price craters as whales dump Chart points to more HYPE price surge HYPE price chart | Source: crypto.news Since December 21, when HYPE peaked at $35.10, it has formed a falling wedge chart pattern. A falling wedge is characterized by two trendlines connecting an asset’s lower lows and lower highs. A bullish breakout typically occurs when the two lines converge. This breakout happened on January 14, as the price rose to test the resistance level at $24.43. The token then executed a break-and-retest pattern, pulling back to the upper side of the wedge before resuming its upward momentum. A break-and-retest is a key continuation pattern, signaling potential further gains. Additionally, HYPE has formed a small inverse head and shoulders pattern, which is often a bullish reversal signal. As a result, HYPE is likely to see a strong bull run if it moves above the $24.43 resistance level. Should this happen, the next target to watch would be $35, its December high, representing a 51% increase from the current price.

His comment follows the inauguration of Donald Trump who’s been rather vocal in favour of the crypto industry. In fact, the Republican leader’s presidential campaign vowed to make America the crypto capital of the world. “If the rules come in and make it a real thing that you can do business with, you’ll find that the banking system will come in hard on the transactional side of it,” CEO Moynihan said in an interview with CNBC today. Bank of America stock has rallied some 30% over the past six months. Trump did not mention crypto in his inaugural speech Following months of support for Bitcoin and the blockchain technology at large – President Trump went silent on crypto during his inaugural address on January 20 th . Investors were put off by no mention of cryptocurrencies in the speech, resulting in a sell-off in Bitcoin that was seen trading at a record of $109,000 just hours before Trump took office. Nonetheless, the US President’s recent moves suggest he remains fully committed to making America a crypto superpower as promised. Donald Trump has picked crypto advocate Paul Atkins to lead the Securities & Exchange Commission and former PayPal chief of operations David Sacks as the “crypto czar” of the White House. Appointing pro-crypto fintech veterans to key roles signals the new government has big plans for the crypto and blockchain industry. BofA disagrees with JPMorgan on crypto BofA chief executive Brian Moynihan’s view on crypto is starkly different from his peer Jamie Dimon who currently heads the largest US bank – JPMorgan Chase & Co. At one point, Dimon even called Bitcoin a currency for fraudsters and criminals. In contrast, “if you go down the street here and you go in and buy lunch, if you can pay with Visa, Mastercard, Apple Pay etc., this [crypto] would just be another form of payment,” Moynihan said as he spoke with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Note that Bitcoin was currently going for about $103,000 at the time of writing. Should you buy Bank of America stock today? According to Brian Moynihan, the Bank of America knows “how to enter the field” and it even has “hundreds of patents on blockchain already.” Last week, the Wall Street bank reported its financial results for the fourth quarter that topped Street estimates on the back of strength in its investment banking unit. Wall Street currently sees a more than 10% upside in Bank of America stock to $52.43 on average.

AVAX exhibited wild price swings in 2024. This record came as the crypto market valuation peaked. It later reversed, shedding some of the profits in 2025.

Let’s explore these and more in our Cryptopolitan price prediction from 2025 to 2031.

The statistics point to growing user interest in the protocol’s stablecoin market, which provides stability in a highly volatile market. AVAX/USD 1-day chart analysis AVAX/USD 1-day chart AVAX was in an ascending channel in the last quarter of 2024 until it reached a high of $55.41 on Dec 12. It later corrected but now moves in a horizontal channel, in consolidation. The William Alligator trendlines are closing as AVAX volatility drops. The relative strength index is 43.12 in neutral territory with the MACD histogram registering little momentum. AVAX/USD 4-hour chart analysis AVAX/USD 4-hour chart The 4-hour chart highlights AVAX’s current run which is now dropping while experiencing negative momentum as shown by the MACD histogram.

Moreover, the William Alligator trendlines, which measure volatility, are sleeping, indicating falling volatility on the daily chart. Why is AVAX down? AVAX is correcting from its highest last year; the crypto market capitalization is also bearish. The drop in Avax value could be attributed to the general market sentiment. Is AVAX a good investment? AVAX’s impressive performance in the first and last quarter of 2024. Explore Cryptopolitan’s price prediction to learn about the coin’s trajectory from 2025 to 2031. Will AVAX reach $50?

According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, AVAX will reach $100 in 2026, with a maximum price of $104.16 for the year. Will AVAX reach $1,000? It remains highly unlikely that AVAX will cross the $1,000 mark before 2030. At that market capitalization, it could be more valuable than Ethereum. Does Avalanche have a good long-term future?

It resumed the positive momentum in October, rising to $49.96 In 2024, it crossed the $60 mark in March.

Dogecoin dips as lawsuits shake D.O.G.E The meme trades at $0.3860, down over 1% in the past 24 hours. The original meme token crashed after multiple developments after the inauguration ceremony.

Bitcoin Becomes More Popular as Institutional Adoption Increases The published report highlights the important cryptocurrency trends for 2025, highlighting the evolving role of digital assets in the global financial system. WisdomTree's analysis reveals that multi-asset portfolios that include Bitcoin consistently outperform portfolios with no exposure to the cryptocurrency. This outperformance, combined with rising client demand, is pushing asset managers to integrate Bitcoin into portfolios or risk being left behind in the increasingly digital financial landscape. “Bitcoin adoption will accelerate as more investors seek exposure to this transformative asset class,” said WisdomTree analyst Dovile Silenskyte. The launch of US-based spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for Bitcoin in 2024 marked a turning point, making cryptocurrency investments more accessible to mainstream investors. WisdomTree predicts this momentum will continue into 2025 as the regulatory environment in the US becomes more favorable under the Trump administration. Globally, Solana’s approval of exchange-traded products (ETPs) for alternative cryptocurrencies such as SOL and XRP is also expected to expand investment opportunities and further integrate cryptocurrencies into traditional finance. “This next wave of altcoin ETPs will diversify crypto investments and solidify their role in the global financial ecosystem,” Silenskyte added. The report also highlights the important role Ethereum plays as the foundation for decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and Web3 applications. Despite scalability issues, recent updates like Dencun are expected to encourage the adoption of layer-2 solutions and further increase their functionality. *This is not investment advice.

Who Called BTC at $1 Envisions Ripple’s XRP Rocket Surge to $24 Price,https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-o-g-who-called-btc-at-1-predicts-ripples-xrp-rocket-surge-to-24-price/,"Popular Bitcoin maximalist Davinci Jeremie, who famously predicted Bitcoin’s rise when it was valued at just $1, is now eyeing a major potential for XRP. In a tweet on Saturday, Jeremie stated that XRP could surge to anywhere between $20 and $24. However, while he sees this as a possibility, he cautions against holding the asset long-term. “XRP may hit $20–$24, but it’s not a safe long-term investment for everyone. Trade, but don’t hold blindly,” Jeremie wrote . He followed up with a video by acknowledging XRP’s recent price movements, noting that while it had already seen impressive gains, he still considers it a speculative trade rather than a safe investment. Notably, the pundit’s cautious stance on XRP stems from his belief that the cryptocurrency is ultimately tied to the banking system. “XRP is a cryptocurrency supporting the banking system for the banking system, just like the Federal Reserve. They have rules, just like the Federal Reserve, but all those rules can change at a whim.” He added. “ So, if you want to invest in a cryptocurrency that is designed to rob from the people, like the banks, go ahead and invest in XRP.” Jeremie’s perspective on XRP has evolved, especially since just two months ago when he referred to the asset as “garbage.” At that time, he predicted XRP’s value could rise to around $2.11 in 2025, but he still hoped it would drop to zero. However, the dramatic surge in XRP’s price since then, up over 450% since the start of November, has forced him to revise his outlook. Despite his reservations, Jeremie’s predictions have often garnered attention from the crypto community for their accuracy. In 2013, he encouraged followers to buy just $1 worth of Bitcoin when it was priced at $1, a decision that would have resulted in substantial profits for those who took his advice. His more recent focus on XRP is thus worth noting, given his ability to anticipate price movements in the past. Adding weight to Jeremie’s prediction, on-chain data highlights a bullish outlook for XRP’s potential. According to Nansen, activity in XRP derivatives markets has skyrocketed, with a notable surge in options and futures trading. Furthermore, open interest in XRP futures is nearing $8 billion, representing an impressive 46% surge this week and a 300% growth since the start of the month. Pundits like James Toledano, COO of Unity Wallet, have also weighed in, emphasizing the importance of regulatory clarity for XRP’s future. In a note on Friday, he stated that the approval of an XRP ETF could trigger significant institutional investment, propelling the token to new heights in 2025. XRP traded at $3.12 at press time, reflecting a 25% gain over the past seven days. Its market capitalization has surged to over $183 billion.",Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,XRP|BTC|TRADING|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-21 15:47:14

The one-day and four-hour charts both indicate a downward trend for FLOW, with technical indicators pointing towards a continuation of the bearish momentum. Is FLOW a good investment? Flow coin has potential as an investment due to its strong partnerships with major brands and its focus on powering decentralized applications, especially in the NFT and gaming spaces. However, like all cryptocurrencies, it carries significant volatility and risks, so investors should carefully consider market conditions and risk tolerance before investing. Why is Flow down? Flow’s decline can be attributed to sustained selling pressure, as reflected in its lower highs and lows across both daily and hourly timeframes. The inability to hold key support levels suggests weak buyer interest, while resistance levels limit upward movements. Broader market conditions and reduced demand for FLOW may also contribute to the bearish momentum, as traders appear hesitant to re-enter at current levels. This combination of weak demand, strong resistance, and market uncertainty has driven the coin’s price downward. Will FLOW recover? FLOW can potentially recover if it can break through resistance levels and maintain momentum. The market’s current consolidation phase suggests a possible breakout, which could either see selling pressure and drive prices higher or lead to further declines. Close monitoring is crucial as market dynamics remain volatile. Will FLOW reach $2? Yes, Flow coin is projected to reach $2 by 2026, with a potential peak of $2.00. This indicates that FLOW is a cryptocurrency market expected to hit and surpass the $2 mark within the next few years. Will FLOW reach $5? Flow will reach $5 by 2029, with a projected peak of $5.91. This suggests significant growth potential, positioning the price of Flow for a leap above the $5 mark soon. Will FLOW reach $10? Based on current predictions, the price of Flow coin is likely to reach $10 by 2031. The maximum projected price for 2031 is $12.56. Does FLOW have a good long-term future? Projections suggest substantial growth over the coming years, with a potential peak of $12.56 by 2031. This positive outlook reflects a strong potential for sustained value appreciation and continued market relevance.

Chainlink (LINK) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to expert technical analysis, LINK appears bullish as it has successfully retested the bullish Cup and Handle price action pattern on the weekly timeframe and is poised for a significant upside rally. Meanwhile, the altcoin currently seems to be consolidating within a tight range due to prevailing market sentiment. Source: Trading View Based on historical price momentum, if LINK breaches the upper boundary of the consolidation and closes a daily candle above the $26.40 level, there is a strong possibility it could rally by 50% to reach the $38.50 level in the coming days.

The TVL on Solana has crossed the $10 billion mark for the first time since the implosion of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange and hit a new historic high of over $12 billion. SOL Price Bags New ATH Against Ether The price of Solana smashed a new record high of $0.0936 against Ethereum (ETH) on Jan. 19 amid frenzied trading in the $TRUMP meme coin. The SOL/ETH pair has, however, retracted to 0.0768 as of publication time. SOL has rocketed about 3,000% from its three-year low of $9 back in December 2022 when the collapse of digital asset exchange FTX and high-profile Solana backer Sam Bankman-Fried, dented sentiment for the network. On Sunday, SOL punched past a new all-time high of $293.31. Solana’s outstanding price action in recent days can be attributed to the meme coin backed by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, Official TRUMP, which has spurred huge interest in SOL, resulting in a considerable increase in both its price and trading volume. Shortly after, Trump’s wife, Melania also launched her own memecoin, MELANIA, on the Solana network. Solana TVL Hits New $12 Billion High Additionally, Solana’s total dollar value locked has set a new high. Solana DeFi protocols now have more than $12 billion in TVL after topping $10 billion, according to data tracked by DeFiLlama. This level has not been seen since August 2022, just before FTX went under and rocked the fifth-largest blockchain ecosystem by market cap. Notably, in USD terms, Solana has surpassed its closest competitor, TRX, which holds $7.3 billion. Ethereum TVL, meanwhile, sits at a vast $66.8 billion. Solana’s rocketing TVL is a clear indicator of user activity and transaction fees, both of which are important for fostering sustainable growth and bolstering further trader adoption. Additionally, it suggests there is still more room for SOL’s price to run. It’s worth noting that the Trump family’s memecoins launch is bringing Solana an inrush of new users and gives the network, which is prone to major outages , a chance to display its robustness. If it passes the test, the Solana ecosystem could continue witnessing massive inflows.",Cryptocurrency|Featured|News|ETH|Ethereum News|SOL|Solana|trump,EN,0,0,SOL|TRADING|ETH|EXCHANGE|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-21 15:52:30

Understandably, the decision was controversial — with critics pointing to the asset’s lack of utility and deriding it as a cynical cash grab . To little surprise, TRUMP immediately attracted a deluge of attention and trading activity — reaching an all-time high (ATH) price of $74.59 and a market capitalization of $31.39 billion on January 19. Since then, the price of TRUMP has receded to $38.26, while its market cap has shrunk to $7.74 billion by press time on January 21. A key contributor to this was the launch of Official Melania (MELANIA) — with the first lady’s meme coin drawing a lot of volume away from her spouse’s. TRUMP price 1-week chart. Source: Finbold While the cynical might deride this as the greatest of all rug pulls , the meme coin is still attracting the interest of traders — although volume has seen a precipitous 40.44% drop, at $24.36 billion, it is still more than three times as high as the asset’s current market cap. Finbold has consulted its very own artificial intelligence (AI) price prediction tool to get a better overview of what levels TRUMP prices could reach in February. Finbold’s AI price prediction tool. Source: Finbold Finbold AI predicts TRUMP price for February 2025 Using a combination of advanced AI models, including OpenAI ’s ChatGPT-4o and ChatGPT-4o mini, Anthropic ’s Claude 3 Opus and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and xAI ’s Grok 2 Vision, Finbold got a relatively wide variety of results. The only bearish prediction came from GPT-4o Mini, which, it should be noted, was built with speed in mind as the primary priority. Per OpenAI’s quick and nimble model, the price of TRUMP will retreat back to $38.00 — and stabilize at those levels. GPT-4o, on the other hand, is significantly more optimistic — projecting a 6.08% increase in the cards for the President’s meme coin, up to a price of $40.50. OpenAI’s flagship model did, however, note that the lack of long-term pricing data impacts the reliability of its prediction. Claude 3 Opus provided a relatively similar outlook — with a slightly more bullish price target at $41.50. Grok 2 Vision and Claude 3.5 Sonnet gave the most bullish forecasts — projecting that TRUMP will reach a price of $45 and $45.25, respectively — equating to a 17.86% upside from Grok and 18.52% for Claude. Both models cited positive sentiment in their reasoning — although that point is debatable . AI price targets for TRUMP for February. Source: Finbold On the whole, the AI models were bullish — predicting an average upside of 10.14%, equating to a price of $42.05. Readers should note that, while the prompts used by Finbold’s AI price prediction tool take into account various factors and technical indicators, such as the relative strength index ( RSI ) and simple moving averages ( SMA ), its outputs cannot serve as a reliable substitute for due diligence and personal research taking into consideration the twenty four seven nature of the crypto market.

Solaxy ($SOLX) – Solana’s Revolutionary Layer-2 Solution Solaxy ($SOLX) aims to combine the benefits of Ethereum and Solana to offer crypto folks a new and improved way of dealing with these blockchains. Primarily, it set out to eliminate issues like failed transactions, network congestion, and inability to scale that have peppered the Solana network for quite some time now. With over $12.8M raised in its ongoing presale and the demand for Solana’s infrastructure on the rise, Solaxy is looking like a strong contender to be the next 100x meme coin . The current price of $0.001608 per token offers an attractive entry point for early adopters, who will also be able to benefit from $SOLX’s 292% staking rewards. 3. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – Harness the Power of AI for Crypto Profitability MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is not too dissimilar from $WEPE, seeing as it, too, aims to offer profitable crypto investment advice to token holders. However, how $MIND achieves this is unique. $MIND is, simply put, an AI agent with a digital personality of its own that engages with people, including influencers, on platforms like X , analyzing what’s being said, forming its unique opinions, and then using all that to come up with trading ideas. You can purchase $MIND tokens for $0.0031635 each, with the presale having already raised close to $3M so far. Since it’s a relatively new presale, it’s also offering very attractive staking rewards of 738%. 4. Official Trump ($TRUMP) – Meme Coin Celebrating Trump’s Presidential Victory Donald Trump launched his own meme coin on 17 January, and it took Wall Street by storm. Soon after launch, it hit a market cap of $15B, making it the third-largest cryptocurrency across all blockchains in terms of market capitalization in virtually no time at all. After the initial frenzy, the price has cooled off from the highs of $75. You can now get $TRUMP at around $40. As Trump has made very clear, the US government is set to introduce several pro-crypto legislations. Ever since he won the elections, the crypto market has been in a massive bull run, as Bitcoin reached all-time highs, and there are at least 8 US states proposing a Bitcoin reserve . All this is expected to ultimately benefit $TRUMP’s price as it’s a direct reflection of Trump’s popularity. Right now, only 25% of the token supply has been made available for trading. This means the developers intend to control the demand to save investors from price shocks. 5. American Coin ($USA) – Patriotic Meme Coin Joins the Frenzy Imbibing the same patriotic spirit of $TRUMP, $USA is another meme coin gaining significant traction. The coin had been sideways for quite some time before it made a massive 1,043% price jump between January 16 and 25. The price moved from a low of $0.000002953 to $0.000033761. Currently, you can get 1 $USA for $0.000013000, and the coin has a market cap of $81.67M at the time of writing. The coin rides on the spirit of $MAGA (Make America Great Again). With the shift in political dynamics in the country, leaders like Trump and Elon look to improve the economic, social, and international reputation of the US. Every positive government move is expected to benefit $USA, and it may be a good coin to hold on to for the next 3–4 years. Trending Markets Can Offer Easy Opportunities, but Exercise Caution With $BTC and $ETH trending, the crypto market has been nicely set up for a steady move upwards. However, even the best crypto investment opportunities, such as the 5 coins above, need to be handled with care and precision. Also, none of the above is a substitute for your own due diligence, nor is it financial advice, and you mustn’t forget to do your own research before investing.",Cryptocurrency Market News,EN,0,0,TRADING|BTC|ETH|MARKET|SOL,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-01-21 15:58:18
33767162,[object Object],1737475120,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Elon Musk’s D.O.G.E Goes Live Amid Backlash – Could Send These 5 Presales to 100x in 2025,https://bitcoinist.com/5-presales-set-to-100x-this-year/,"Despite being hit with three lawsuits within minutes of Trump reclaiming the presidency, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) is officially live. And it’s bringing attention to these five presales set to 100x. D.O.G.E aims to minimize the federal budget by $2T through measures like downsizing the federal workforce and modernizing tech. However, it’s been criticized for conflicts of interest and lack of transparency. Regardless of the backlash, having the Dogefather take the reins of a government department signals bullish times for crypto – especially considering that when Musk shills $DOGE, many meme coins often spike . Also boosting market sentiment is Trump launching his very own meme coin, $TRUMP . As it perks up, so too might low-cap presale coins like $FLOCK and $BEST. Let’s probe into why. $FLOCK – Vote on a Boundless Platform for Crypto Rewards Flockerz ($FLOCK) is a distinct vote-to-earn platform that rewards token holders each time they vote on Flocktopia’s future trajectory. Because it is entirely DAO-run, Flocktopia’s possibilities are limitless – especially considering a significant 25% of the total token supply is set aside for voter rewards. Additional $FLOCK can also be earned by staking $FLOCK, which boasts an outstanding 256% APY. Further signaling prosperous times for $FLOCK token holders is that 20% of tokens are earmarked for marketing. Its value is anticipated to spike once it attracts mainstream attention. Only time will tell if it’ll spike an eye-boggling 100x. But, seeing it’s available for just $0.0066883 with a $11.6M+ market cap, it might be worth giving $FLOCK a shot while it’s so cheap. $BEST – Cheap Gas Fees & Rewards for Best Wallet Users $BEST is the anchor token of Best Wallet , a crypto wallet that enables investors to buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies. However, it sets itself apart from its competitors – even MetaMask – by featuring presale tokens. Best Wallet is touted to soon support some 60+ blockchain networks and develop its own crypto card. Users will shortly be able to swap their digital assets on various chains freely while on the go. $BEST gives investors unrivaled benefits, such as early access to the latest projects, reduced transaction costs, community governance, and higher staking rewards. The coin’s staking APY is 235%, making HODLing $BEST attractive for early buyers. Now’s an opportune time to buy $BEST, especially as it’s currently priced at just $0.023675 and is set to go up in around 13 hours. $SOLX – Contribute to Addressing Solana’s Congestion Woes $SOLX is the native token of Solaxy , the world’s first Solana Layer-2 network designed to unlock Solana’s full potential. Although Solana is already a go-to for meme coin developers and traders, having achieved an impressive 1,504 transactions per second (tps), it’s unfortunately not alien to network congestion and failed transactions. $SOLX helps Solana solve these problems by setting aside 30% of its total token supply to help fix them. Also aiding in making the network speedier and more scalable is the fact that $SOLX merges both Solana’s and Ethereum’s advantages. Anyone can join the L2 by buying $SOLX, which is currently available for just $0.001608 and has an eye-boggling $12.8M market cap. $REXAS – Invest in Tokenized Estate, Art & Commodities $REXAS is the backbone of Rexas Finance, a crypto venture that tokenizes virtually all real-world assets (RWAs), from estate and commodities to art and gold. The token gives holders the chance to participate in fractional ownership of various RWAs, democratizing investment opportunities to all, regardless of their bank balances. Imagine owning shares in a grand mansion in the countryside for a fraction of the price – acquiring $REXAS makes that possible. Additionally, the RWA market’s success makes $REXAS a positive investment opportunity. It is poised to become a trillion-dollar global industry by 2030. You can participate in the thriving RWA sector by purchasing $REXAS for just $0.200. The presale has already raised over $42.2M, highlighting the coin’s early success and possible future viability. $HUNT – Own, Rent & Lease Virtual Elements for Profits Last but not least, another coin out of the 5 presales set to 100x is $HUNT, the token of LuckHunter. LuckHunter is a novel metaverse that enables token holders to own casino tables and buy and lease lounge property for gains beyond the native token’s success. Users can explore various scenes in the metaverse for an ultimate gaming experience. For example, ‘Utlantic City’ features seaside views and thrilling gameplay options, whereas ‘Las Vexus’ offers high-class lounges and poker tables. If users want to switch up gameplay, they can customize their own metaverse empire, creating their own skins, decor, and themes. A substantial 50% of the total token supply goes toward the presale, showing $HUNT’s dedication to securing early success. One $HUNT currently costs just $0.00138, and it can be bought with $USDT, $ETH, $BNB, $MATIC, or fiat. 5 Presales Set to Go 100x Thanks to Musk’s D.O.G.E As Elon Musk continues with his D.O.G.E venture, the crypto landscape is poised to thrive, owing to the entrepreneur’s ongoing Web3 advocacy. His crypto influence could boost each of these 5 presales to 100x, especially given their unique utility and opportunities for extra gains. However, success is never guaranteed. The crypto realm is a volatile place, so you must always do your own research and never invest more than you’d be willing to lose.",Altcoin News|Crypto News|Dogecoin|Elon Musk|D.O.G.E.,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-01-21 15:58:40

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Solana’s price surges with rumors of Solana ETFs being approved in 2025, while DTX gains momentum with its unique trading platform, offering stocks, forex, and ETFs. Table of Contents Solana ETF buzz fuels bullish sentiments DTX Exchange raised over $12m in presales so far Can Solana breach $400 this month? Conclusion Solana (SOL) is emerging as one of the ‘it’ tokens in circulation in today’s market. Currently, the Solana price is at around $250, which is a very impressive 44% weekly gain despite dropping another 8% in 24 hours. Enthusiasm for a possible Solana ETF and the emerging bullish mood for the entire landscape is being driven by the market outlook, placing SOL as one of the most critical players in the future of blockchain. Meanwhile, with centralized, decentralized trading focused on different instruments, such as stocks, foreign exchange, or ETFs, DTX Exchange is becoming a promising platform. Solana ETF buzz fuels bullish sentiments One of the key bullish influences on SOL is the establishment of a Solana ETF. Solana will be shown more prominently to institutional investors, and thus, there may be large-scale acceptance and inflows from capital due to it. Solana ecosystem’s expansion of DeFi and NFT improvements puts Solana in the race for the best blockchains. SOL may find its way to twice the price by 2025 end by virtue of all of the institutional interest that is growing and because of the ETF frenzy. Solana’s productive technology and low transaction costs are ideal for both developers and users. DTX Exchange raised over $12m in presales so far DTX Exchange is rapidly becoming the talk of the town in the crypto community. In its seventh presale stage, DTX Exchange has raised an impressive $12.1 million, with its token price at $0.14. The upcoming stage will increase the price to $0.16, indicating strong demand and investor confidence. DTX has created a platform that serves as a bridge between centralized and decentralized finance and hence allows users to trade over 120,000 asset classes, stocks, FOREX, ETF investments, etc. Phoenix Wallet, the platform’s branded secure custody brand and governance tool, gives users a greater say in future products and addresses key requirements in current markets. It has a performance test of 200,000 transactions per second in the test net and over 300,000 wallet addresses, which means that DTX will be redefining the trading experience. Live DTX Exchange is set to open in Q1 2025 and will further keep the investors’ excitement alive. You might also like: The DTX Exchange hybrid platform shocks the online trading space Can Solana breach $400 this month? As Solana continues its shocking rise, the question on everyone’s mind is whether it can breach the $400 mark this month. While some analysts are cautious due to market volatility and regulatory uncertainties, others see strong potential for SOL to continue its upward trajectory. The formation of bullish technical patterns and the ongoing accumulation by whales suggest that Solana could indeed push higher. However, reaching $400 in such a short time frame might be ambitious, especially considering the broader market conditions. Conclusion The evolution of the cryptocurrency sector at present reflects radical advancements in the Solana and DTX Exchange occurrences. SOL could reach the threshold of 500 dollars by mid-2025. However, DTX Exchange is becoming attractive to investors due to its innovative trading platform and strong presale performances. With the rapid growth of the crypto market, Solana and DTX stand to be great beneficiaries of this drive. The best bet should be waiting for Solana to reach or break through the 400-dollar mark this month. What is clear is that both Solana and DTX are names to look at. They are well-positioned with a unique product proposition that will help them capture a significant number of transactions.

To read full editions, subscribe . Anthony Bourdain would famously go to great lengths to avoid and outwit a guy inside him who wanted to rot in bed all day. I do something similar with my inner contrarian. But I can’t help it with this one: The crypto portfolio of Trump-linked DeFi platform World Liberty Financial could very well turn out to be the crypto strategic reserve that many anticipate will soon be announced. And it’s already getting messy. To the conspiracy theorist that sometimes types for me — like the rat in Ratatouille — there are obvious signs. Donald Trump Jr. perhaps let it slip on X. To commemorate Trump Sr.’s second inauguration on Monday, becoming the 45th and 47th US president, World Liberty Financial made a series of what it called “strategic purchases” of various coins. To commemorate the inauguration of Donald J. Trump as the 47th President of the United States, $WLFI is proud to announce the following strategic purchases today: $47,000,000 ETH $47,000,000 wBTC $4,700,000 Aave $4,700,000 LINK $4,700,000 TRX $4,700,000 ENA Excited for the… — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) January 21, 2025 Deep thinkers would quickly spot that one of those coins is not like the others. World Liberty Financial runs on Ethereum — so ETH makes sense. Trump has also done well courting the Bitcoiners, so wBTC gets a green check as a DeFi-compatible nod to the real thing. So does AAVE, LINK and ENA. Platforms tied to all three coins are expected to integrate with World Liberty Financial whenever it goes live. But why TRX? (The conspiracist in me is now screaming about the $30 million plowed into the World Liberty Financial token sale by Tron founder Justin Sun last month. And the curious switch from cbBTC to WBTC amid that drama. Ignore him.) The first US 🇺🇸 national crypto exchange should be named “Trump Reserve Xchange,” abbreviated as T.R.X. — H.E. Justin Sun 🍌 (@justinsuntron) November 13, 2024 He somehow snuck this one through For what it’s worth, if World Liberty Financial really is the US crypto strategic reserve in disguise, it’s doing pretty well so far. It has spent $220.1 million on crypto since the end of November. Now it’s worth $234 million, putting it over 6% ahead, with gains made on BTC, ETH and AAVE against losses in TRX, ENA and ONDO.

As crypto markets hit new highs, Ethereum lags behind, prompting traders to look to Elluminex for the next big breakout. Table of Contents Ethereum rose 17,000% during 2017 rally Elluminex to put TON into overdrive Crypto markets are heating up, with multiple assets reaching all-time highs. However, Ethereum has seen relatively slow growth. But, in 2017, the situation was different. At the time, Ethereum saw a huge rally, rivaled only by Bitcoin’s strong growth. Fuelled by massive adoption, tech advancements and the ICO boom, Ethereum grew tremendously. This secured it the second spot among all crypto assets. Now, traders are looking for the next token that can replicate Ethereum’s early success. Most recently, some are looking at Elluminex. You might also like: Buying Elluminex now smarter than trying to catch Dogecoin after 300% run Ethereum rose 17,000% during 2017 rally Ethereum’s 2017 bull run was one of the biggest market rallies in crypto history. At the time, in January 2017, Ethereum (ETH) traded at just $8. Fast forward to January 2018, the token was at $1,400. This growth amounted to a stunning 17,000% increase in just one year. Several factors made this growth possible, including both its fundamentals and market dynamics. Critically, Ethereum underwent a revolution in smart contract functionality. The network introduced tools that would let developers build complete decentralized applications (dApps). This uncovered many use cases for the network, bringing developers and users to the chain. For that reason, the crypto space saw an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) boom, as developers issued tokens for their dApps. Moreover, smart contract functionalities of the chain enabled traders to easily launch their own tokens. This brought unprecedented levels of crypto projects to the Ethereum ecosystem. The explosion of crypto projects brought significant capital, boosting Ethereum’s price and network Total Value Locked (TVL). For both these reasons, Ethereum became the default network for dApps and DeFi applications. Currently, it still holds dominance, controlling more than 53% of all blockchain TVL. Currently, the TVL on the chain amounts to $65 billion , while ETH’s market cap is $403 billion. Thanks to its unparalleled utility, Ethereum became the second-largest crypto asset, rivalled only by Bitcoin. Now, traders are looking for the next token that can replicate its early success. Elluminex to put TON into overdrive While Ethereum still holds dominance, the chain has its issues. Slow network speed and high fees prompted several alternatives to pop up. These include Tron, Solana, and more recently TON . It is this latest challenger that has significant potential to eat into Ethereum’s dominance. Like most other high-efficiency chains, TON boasts lightning speeds and very low fees. At the same time, it has the unique advantage of its Telegram integration. Thanks to Telegram, TON has access to over 950 billion of the messaging app users. This has already led to significant growth for TON. Last year, TON saw a 800% rise in network TVL, becoming the fastest-growing blockchain. Now, a new project has the potential to help TON rise even higher. Recently, TON gained its own dedicated DEX, Elluminex (ELX) . TON’s Elluminex is a DEX platform that enables self-custodial trading across 40 major blockchains. Thanks to its cross-chain bridges, it bridges TON with most other chains. This not only reduces slippage, a major issue for DEX, but also boosts liquidity. The potential Elluminex has for TON is significant. By bringing in more liquidity to the network, TON’s TVL and market cap could soon reach their true potential.

These included positions as head of the cryptocurrency division at the SEC and head of the FBI's cyber division. In comments to the media, Gambaryan said that although he is not a political figure, he led several high-profile investigations during President Trump's last term as a federal IRS agent. If the opportunity arose, it would be an honor for me to serve my country again and work alongside the incredible men and women in federal law enforcement who have tirelessly worked to bring me back to the family,” he added. Binance CEO Richard Teng commented on his colleague's possible move to Trump's team: “At the moment, Tigran is still a member of our staff, so let's see what his intentions are. I'm not privy to his thought process.

However, the bears took control of the market in the past 24 hours and pushed XRP down by 3%. But investors shouldn’t lose hope, as the XRP price might soon gain upward momentum. XRP’s Recent Breakout Thanks to the 22% weekly surge, the XRP price at press time was $3.14. This allowed the token to break above a bullish pattern. Ali Martinez, a popular crypto analyst, posted a tweet pointing out this development. Martinez mentioned that Ripple’s value has jumped above a bull flag pattern. Such breakouts often results in price hike, which on this occasion could push XRP above $4.4. In fact, investors are showing confidence in the token. XRP’s exchange outflow increased over the last seven days—a sign of raising buying pressure. The big-pocketed players in the market are also actively trading the token, which was evident from its high whale transaction count. Source: Santiment Apart from this, Hyblock Capital’s data also revealed another bullish metric. The token’s buy volume reached 100 on the 20th of January. For starters, a number closer to 100 means that buying activity is high. What Derivatives Metrics Suggest While assessing crypto prices, derivatives metrics also provide crucial inputs. As per Coinglass’ data , the token’s long/short ratio registered an uptick in the 24-hour timeframe. This meant that there are more long positions in the market than short positions—signaling that bullish sentiment is rising. This also supported the possibility of a continued price hike, which can kickstart a bull rally above $4. Odds of XRP Reaching $4 The technical indicator MA Cross remains bullish as the 9-day EMA was resting well above the 21-day MA. interestingly, at the time of writing, XRP price was testing the 9-day MA resistance. If buying activity continues and the market condition supported, then it won’t be ambitious expecting the token to break this resistance. However, it will be critical for XRP also go above its resistance at $3.2, which it failed to do last week. Source: TradingView Conclusion XRP has immense potential going forward. Not just because it’s one of the largest altcoin, but also for the utility it brings along. Ergo, this latest 3% setback might just be a short-term phenomenon and if bulls take back control, the chances of XRP touching $4.4 are high.

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Bitcoin is trying hard to hold its momentum above $100K. This surge in value is partly attributed to the broader market response to Donald Trump’s election. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential of holding above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction.

Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Why is Bitcoin down today?

This resulted in a steep decline in the BTC price chart. Will BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price recently broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, forming a new ATH. The price is currently aiming to maintain its buying demand above $100K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 Million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future.

Bitcoin price prediction January 2025 December was a bullish month for Bitcoin, characterized by significant upswings. Will BTC price establish a new ATH in January 2025? Bitcoin’s price might attempt to surge toward $100,000 from its recent low and be pushed further, at least $108,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation around $91K. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction January 2025 $91,000 $100,000 $108,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Bitcoin spot ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 in the highest and the low could be around $95,000.

We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026.

Pepe Plunges Due To Enormous Bearish Pressure After months of sideways price action, Pepe had a massive rally last month, during which the price surged over 200% within 10 days. The price moved with enormous upward momentum, yet when Pepe reached the $0.000025 price level, it faced significant rejection, leading to the end of the price surge. Due to reduced demand, Pepe entered a sideways price action between $0.000017350 and $0.000023. After three weeks of consolidation, Pepe broke out of this range-bound price action and reached the latest All-Time High (ATH) at $0.00002825. The price again consolidated between $0.000023 and $0.0000255 but fell below this range this Tuesday. Pepe is 42% below the ATH, has moved below the 50-day SMA, and is dropping to the 100-day SMA. Pepe has moved -12.17% in the last 24 hours and trades at $0.00001639. The trading volume has also increased, indicating the bears are taking the price lower, and the decline is gaining momentum. Elluminex (ELX): A DeFi Giant In The Making Unlike Pepe, a meme coin with limited utility, Elluminex is an emerging project that aims to become the next DeFi leader by providing users with a practical ecosystem with real-world use cases. Elluminex wants to reshape the decentralized economy by becoming the first comprehensive DeFi hub on the TON blockchain. The DeFi market has grown steadily over the last few years as many people have joined it, but many issues deter newcomers from participating and adopting decentralization. Investors face many challenges, including fragmented liquidity, high transaction costs, a learning curve due to complex concepts and non-user-friendly interfaces, and limited access to early-stage investment opportunities. Moreover, existing platforms lack many features, so investors need to traverse between multiple applications and platforms, leading to errors and security risks. Elluminex plans to address all these issues by introducing an all-in-one DeFi platform on the TON blockchain. It will leverage TON’s efficient architecture, unmatched scalability, and unparalleled transfer speeds to solve all the issues and provide an efficient and secure environment. A Next Generation DeFi Platform The platform will be a one-stop solution for all things DeFi and allow users to trade, farm, stake, bridge, and track portfolio performance. Its notable components include a robust DEX (Decentralized Exchange), a learning academy, a portfolio tracker, staking, and farming mechanisms. The Elluminex Academy will help bridge the knowledge gap in DeFi by providing learning resources and tutorials that help newcomers understand all the essential Web3 concepts and the platform's workings. Thus, beginners can adapt quickly and transition smoothly to DeFi. The Elluminex DEX will ensure users get lightning-fast transfer speeds for minimal fees and offer high liquidity and low slippage on all asset transfers. Its user-friendly design will allow easy access to advanced trading features such as limit orders and LP trading. Thus, users can efficiently trade assets in a non-custodial environment. Furthermore, the platform will be integrated with the cross-chain bridge, enabling seamless asset transfers across different blockchains to enhance interoperability. Thus, users will be exposed to diverse trading opportunities and efficiently manage their assets from various blockchains under the Elluminex interface. An AI-powered portfolio tracker will provide users with performance analytics, real-time data, and market insights. It will allow users to monitor their portfolios, track the performance of their holdings, and make data-driven decisions. The presale for the native token ELX will be announced soon. It offers an incredible opportunity to early investors since the project will tap into TON’s capabilities and unleash DeFi’s full potential to capture the growing market.

The up-and-coming DeFi project, Elluminex (ELX), is drawing interest due to its real-world applications and bold mission to revolutionize the DeFi industry. Let's dive into why Elluminex should be considered a must-buy token for 2025. Pepe Faces Heavy Bearish Pressure After spending months in a sideways price movement, Pepe experienced an explosive rally last month, with its price climbing over 200% in just 10 days. Despite this strong upward momentum, Pepe encountered significant resistance at the $0.000025 mark, which halted the price surge. Lack of demand caused Pepe to enter a sideways trading pattern between $0.000017350 and $0.000023. Following three weeks of consolidation, Pepe broke out from this range and reached a new All-Time High (ATH) at $0.00002825. The price then consolidated again between $0.000023 and $0.0000255 but fell below this range earlier this week. Currently, Pepe is 42% below its ATH, has dipped under the 50-day SMA, and is heading toward the 100-day SMA. Over the past 24 hours, Pepe dropped by 12.17% and is trading at $0.00001639. The increase in trading volume suggests that bears are pushing the price lower, with the downturn gaining momentum. Elluminex (ELX): A Potential DeFi Leader Unlike Pepe, which is primarily a meme coin with limited functionality, Elluminex is a burgeoning project aiming to establish itself as a leader in DeFi by offering a comprehensive ecosystem with practical use cases. Elluminex seeks to redefine the decentralized financial landscape by becoming the premier DeFi hub on the TON blockchain. Although the DeFi market has seen steady growth over the years, several issues discourage newcomers from embracing and adopting decentralization. Investors often encounter challenges like fragmented liquidity, high transaction fees, a steep learning curve due to complex concepts, and limited access to early-stage investment opportunities. Existing platforms frequently lack many features, forcing investors to juggle multiple applications and platforms, increasing the risk of errors and security threats. Elluminex plans to tackle these challenges by introducing an all-in-one DeFi platform on the TON blockchain. By leveraging TON's efficient architecture, unmatched scalability, and exceptional transfer speeds, Elluminex aims to provide a secure and efficient environment. A Revolutionary DeFi Platform This platform will serve as a one-stop shop for all DeFi needs, enabling users to trade, farm, stake, bridge, and track portfolio performance. Key features include a powerful DEX (Decentralized Exchange), an educational academy, a portfolio tracker, and mechanisms for staking and farming.

In an interview with CNBC, Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, has stated that Bitcoin’s value is set to soar into the “multiple millions.” He also proposed the establishment of a strategic Bitcoin reserve by the United States, a move he believes could lead other G20 nations to follow suit. Coinbase Predicts BTC Price to Record ‘Multiple Millions’ At a Davos panel, while crypto leaders were upbeat about Trump’s presidency, South Africa’s central bank chief criticized their U.S. lobbying, dismissing Bitcoin as a viable reserve asset. Meanwhile, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong saw potential for increased market investment during Trump’s term. JUST IN: Coinbase CEO says Bitcoin will hit ""multiple millions price range"" pic.twitter.com/SPB6KQxPTw — Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) January 21, 2025 He further mentioned, according to a Reuters report , that new legislation in Congress could lead to significant investments in cryptocurrencies. The Coinbase CEO also emphasized that the recent all-time high in Bitcoin’s value was largely due to Donald Trump’s inauguration. He argued that Bitcoin could potentially serve as a modern gold standard. He said, “Bitcoin is a better form of money than gold… For a store-of-value, it’s important governments hold bitcoin over time.” Additionally, he believes that BTC price could reach ‘multiple million’ under Trump’s leadership as the crypto president understands core value of blockchain. He also suggested a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve, arguing that it would strongly promote cryptocurrencies at an institutional level. Armstrong believes that creating such a reserve would encourage other major economies, particularly those in the G20, to explore similar options. His reasoning is that when a leading global economy like the U.S. supports Bitcoin, other nations will likely recognize and consider its benefits. Brian said, “‘To have a leader of the largest GDP country in the world come out undeniably and say that he wants to be the first crypto president.” Polymarket Gives 35% Chance of Bitcoin Reserve Crypto investors are hopeful that Trump will set up a national bitcoin reserve, following his announcement of such plans in July 2024. However, the likelihood that a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) will be established within the first 100 days of Trump’s presidency has decreased from a high of 55%. Polymarket now estimates there is a 35% chance that Trump will initiate an SBR during this period.

39264220,https://nulltx.com/?p=140124,1737480879,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Lightchain AI and Wall Street Pepe Holders Rush To Look At This New Project with Major Announcement Pending,https://nulltx.com/lightchain-ai-and-wall-street-pepe-holders-rush-to-look-at-this-new-project-with-major-announcement-pending/,"As the crypto market gains bullish momentum, both experienced users and newcomers are starting to take notice of exciting new projects. Among the latest to catch the eye of Lightchain AI and Wall Street Pepe holders is a new project that could create a significant buzz after its mainnet launch. Enter PlutoChain ($PLUTO), a new utility-driven project that could push Bitcoin’s network to new levels thanks to its innovative Layer-2 blockchain Let’s get into it. Smart Contracts on Bitcoin? PlutoChain ($PLUTO) Might Make It Possible PlutoChain ($PLUTO) could be on its way to changing how we think about Bitcoin by tackling some of its most well-known limitations. By adding smart contracts and decentralized apps (dApps) to the Bitcoin network, PlutoChain could change it from a digital store of value into a dynamic platform for modern blockchain innovation. One of the project’s most impressive upgrades is speed. While Bitcoin typically takes around 10 minutes to confirm a transaction, it slashes that time to just 2 seconds. This dramatic improvement could open new possibilities for microtransactions, gaming, and advanced DeFi applications – areas where Bitcoin has historically lagged behind. But PlutoChain isn’t just a concept or a roadmap – it’s already operational. Its testnet handles over 43,200 transactions daily which demonstrates that it’s not only fast but also built to meet real-world demands. This isn’t just an idea in the works; it’s an active, fully functional blockchain solution with real-world results. A key feature setting it apart is its community-first approach. Developers and users are given a voice in the project’s evolution to make sure decisions are transparent and inclusive. This participatory framework could make it a magnet for builders and innovators looking for a trustworthy and collaborative environment. Another major advantage is PlutoChain’s compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This makes it simple for Ethereum-based projects to migrate or integrate which would bring DeFi, NFTs, and other blockchain innovations into the Bitcoin network. For developers, it’s an invitation to tap into Bitcoin’s security while exploring new possibilities that weren’t feasible before. Security remains a top priority for the project – trusted firms such as SolidProof , QuillAudits , and Assure DeFi have rigorously audited the project to offer reassurance that the platform is both reliable and safe. By combining Bitcoin’s renowned security with the flexibility of modern blockchain technology, PlutoChain could strike a balance few other projects can claim. By improving usability, improving speed, and fostering innovation, it could push Bitcoin far beyond its role as a digital gold standard. As the project grows, it could have the potential to open up new opportunities for decentralized finance and bring new life to the Bitcoin network. For both Bitcoin fans and developers, it’s an exciting look at what can happen when traditional technology meets modern innovation. Lightchain AI (LCAI) — Using Artificial Intelligence for Smarter Blockchain Solutions On the other hand, Lightchain AI looks to improve blockchain systems by integrating artificial intelligence and addresses common challenges like transaction speed, energy consumption, and scalability. The project focuses on making blockchain networks more efficient and adaptable by using AI to analyze large amounts of data and respond to patterns in real-time. This approach could help optimize the overall performance of decentralized networks and make them more responsive to user needs. One of the key areas Lightchain AI targets is transaction validation and consensus mechanisms. These processes traditionally require a lot of computational power, which can lead to higher energy costs. By applying AI to these functions, Lightchain AI hopes to reduce energy consumption and improve overall sustainability. The platform also offers tools for developers to build smarter decentralized applications (dApps) that can process data more efficiently. While the project is still in development, it presents a practical approach to overcoming some of the long-standing limitations of blockchain technology. Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) — New Meme Coin Gaining Traction Among Crypto Enthusiasts As of January 20, 2025, Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) has raised over $53 million in its ongoing presale which set a record for one of the most successful meme coin fundraising efforts to date. This impressive amount highlights the strong investor interest and confidence in the project, despite meme coins often being seen as speculative investments. Wall Street Pepe looks to provide more than just humor by offering its community valuable tools like trading signals and market analysis, which could set it apart from other meme coins. Unlike many meme coins that quickly fade into obscurity, Wall Street Pepe has focused on developing a loyal user base and exploring ways to bring more utility to the project. It has attracted attention for its potential to connect with the growing interest in meme culture while also gaining traction as a way to engage with the broader crypto market. With a growing community and an increasing presence in crypto discussions, Wall Street Pepe is positioning itself to offer more than just a laugh – though it certainly doesn’t shy away from humor. Summary Although both Wall Street Pepe and Lightchain AI offer unique features and attract interest in different ways, PlutoChain might stand out due to its combination of speed, scalability, and Bitcoin integration. With its fast transaction times, real-world testnet success, and the potential to bring smart contracts and decentralized apps to Bitcoin, PlutoChain could offer a better solution for the future of blockchain technology.

The transaction, reported by Lookonchain, comes amidst an ongoing class action lawsuit targeting the creators of Pump.fun for allegedly exploiting users and violating securities laws. Pump fun’s Solana Deposits and Trading Activity Over time, Pump.fun has grown to be one of the largest players in the Solana space having launched over 6 million tokens. According to Lookonchain, Pump.fun has made a total of 1,901,332 SOL deposits to Kraken, which is roughly equal to $386.8 million. Furthermore, the platform has sold SOL worth 264,373 which equates to $41.64 million in USDC. However, there has been a lot of activity on the platform, and there are some concerns regarding its operations. According to the sources, Pump.fun generated $572 million in fees via its advanced token creation tools with alleged misuse of issuing volatile and unregistered tokens by some users. This financial situation has only added to the spotlight as Pump.fun is now facing a federal class action lawsuit. Class Action Lawsuit Against Pump fun Two law firms Burwick Law and Wolf Popper LLP filed a class action lawsuit against Pump.fun on behalf of investors who had been impacted. The suit, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges the platform preys on its users and promotes hate speech. The lawsuit stated that Pump.fun permitted the sharing of abusive content regarding race, torture, and adult content, presumably to generate revenue from transaction fees. Plaintiff Kendall Carnahan also alleged that the Peanut the Squirrel platform offered unregistered securities and thereby violated securities laws. The suit also claims that Pump.fun targeted unsuspecting investors with the aim of making them invest in volatile tokens which was detrimental to their investment. However, several users claimed to have made millions, however, only 0.41% of the wallets earned over $10000 in profit as per Dune Analytics. Controversy Surrounding Operations Founded in January of 2024, Pump.fun has come under fire for reportedly making a select few users profiting while the majority lose money. The platform had also been known for its live streaming service, which has since been pulled, with people performing dangerous acts like pretending to commit suicide. The analysis revealed that 289 wallets connected with Pump.fun have made over a million dollars, whereas the majority of investors got little to no profit or even lost some of it. Some of the critics have claimed that the platform token creation tools were used in a wrong way and that is why there is legal battle at the moment. Solana Price Rally Looming? Pump.fun’s significant transactions involving Solana have drawn attention to the asset’s price movements. Solana’s price is currently consolidating in the $230–$250 range after reaching a high of $290. Analysts indicate that this consolidation phase is critical for determining the next price trend. SOL/USD 1-day price chart (source: TradingView) Technical indicators suggest that Solana’s price has support at $225, with $260 and $290 acting as immediate resistance levels. A breakout above $290 could potentially push Solana’s price to the $360 mark. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 55.65, signaling moderate bullish momentum. Additionally, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) value of +0.05 indicates continued capital inflows, supporting the possibility of further price gains.

While the ADA bulls face a bleak outlook amid growing bearish sentiment, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is capturing the attention of whales and bulls alike with its groundbreaking presale success. WallitIQ (WLTQ): A Rising Star Captivating The Bulls And Whales WallitIQ (WLTQ) is poised to redefine the cryptocurrency wallet market, and its presale success is a testament to its massive potential. Bulls and whales are flocking to the project as its presale gains unprecedented traction, raising millions of dollars in record time. WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) revolutionary features, including AI-powered security and multi-asset support, are attracting significant investments, making the presale one of the hottest opportunities in the crypto space. The presale is nearing completion, with thousands of investors participating. Early adopters have seen the token’s price surge by 145% since the first round, and analysts predict further price surges as the token’s launch draws near. The WallitIQ (WLTQ) platform is expected to generate $5 million in monthly revenue after launch, solidifying its position as a game-changer in the trillion-dollar cryptocurrency market. Whales are taking notice, and savvy bulls are seizing this chance to secure the project’s token at an affordable price of $0.042 before its value skyrockets. In addition, the Escrow Connect feature improves security by assessing decentralized applications (dApps) for potential threats before users gain access. Moreover, the implementation of AES and ECC encryption protects private keys and transactions, setting a new standard for safety and user experience. Amid its native token’s recent listing on CoinMarketCap , the WallitIQ (WLTQ) platform is poised to transform the digital asset management landscape. The Physical 2 Digital (P2D) wallet facilitates the seamless transition of physical assets into digital tokens, thereby improving liquidity for cryptocurrency users. Meanwhile, the crypto project has strengthened investor confidence by completing a smart contract audit performed by the reputable SolidProof firm. WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) MVP mobile app also establishes its position as a leader in crypto wallet technology. It simplifies wallet management with features like simulated ETH and USDT transactions, QR code payments, and real-time market updates via the CoinGecko API. Users can analyze interactive candlestick charts, simulate daily transfers, and enjoy a sleek, user-friendly interface for all skill levels. Future updates promise AI-driven trading, price notifications, and more features to meet evolving user needs. Currently priced at $0.0420, the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token presents a strong investment opportunity. On the other hand, the Cardano price is still at risk of a further crash due to significant selling pressure. Cardano Price: ADA Bulls Under Pressure Amid Market Decline The Cardano price has been a major player in the cryptocurrency market, but recent trends suggest that ADA bulls may face a challenging period ahead. Despite earlier optimism, the Cardano price is showing signs of weakening as market volatility increases. As a result, ADA bulls are struggling to maintain the buying pressure that once brought the Cardano price to prominence. Declining transaction volumes and growing competition in the blockchain ecosystem further compound their challenges. Further compounding the challenges of ADA bulls is the fact that whales appear to be shifting their attention away from the Cardano price, as on-chain data reveals a drop in large transactions involving the token. This development with the whales indicates diminishing confidence in the Cardano price among influential investors, further pressuring the ADA bulls to turn bearish. While Cardano’s development team continues to innovate, the ADA price is expected to face a significant crash unless new catalysts emerge. Bulls must regroup to counter this downturn, but for now, the Cardano price prospects look grim. With fewer whales backing the token and bulls struggling to gain traction, the Cardano price outlook remains precarious, leaving investors cautious. Whales are crucial to the market, and their absence could lead to further instability in the Cardano price performance. Conclusion The Cardano price future may be uncertain as ADA bulls struggle, but the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token is shining as the next big thing in crypto. Whales and bulls are already capitalizing on the token’s potential, and the presale’s overwhelming success clearly indicates its bright future. With its innovative technology, growing community, and rapid adoption, the WallitIQ (WLTQ) platform is expected to dominate the cryptocurrency wallet market. Now is the time to secure your position in the ongoing presale. Don’t miss this chance to invest early and reap the rewards as the token’s value soars. This is more than an investment; it’s an opportunity to create life-changing wealth.

In a rigorous analysis presented by Bitcoin Magazine Pro , lead analyst Matt Crosby applies a sophisticated blend of historical data, moving average analysis, and statistical modeling to predict the forthcoming Bitcoin bull cycle peak. Crosby’s findings project October 19, 2025, as a pivotal date, with Bitcoin reaching a median price of $200,000 and the potential for peaks extending to $230,000 when accounting for statistical outliers. Access the Comprehensive Analysis For an in-depth understanding of the mathematical methodologies and the complete analysis, refer to the full video presentation available on Bitcoin Magazine Pro's platform. The Pi Cycle Top Indicator: An Analytical Benchmark Central to Crosby’s predictive framework is the Pi Cycle Top Indicator , renowned for its precision in identifying Bitcoin’s cyclical price peaks within narrow temporal margins during past bull markets. The indicator functions by employing two critical moving averages: 111-Day Moving Average (111DMA) : Reflecting shorter-term price dynamics. 350-Day Moving Average (350DMA) multiplied by two: Offering a broader historical perspective. The nomenclature ""Pi"" arises from the ratio of these averages, approximating 3.142. Historically, the intersection of these moving averages has corresponded with Bitcoin’s market cycle peaks: 2017 : The indicator predicted the peak with a one-day margin of error. 2021 : Accurately identified the exact peak date. Methodological Precision: From Data to Predictions Crosby extends his analysis through Monte Carlo simulations, a robust statistical technique that models numerous potential trajectories for Bitcoin’s price evolution. Key facets of this approach include: Quantifying median daily returns and associated volatility over the preceding 791 days. Running more than 1,000 simulations to map a spectrum of plausible price paths. Deriving a median price peak of $200,000, with an average of $230,000 when incorporating extreme data points. These simulations align with historical patterns, suggesting that the next Bitcoin bull cycle peak will likely occur on October 19, 2025. Examining Diminishing Returns To estimate the price range at the projected peak, Crosby evaluates the historical phenomenon of diminishing returns, where each successive cycle exhibits proportionally smaller price increases relative to its moving averages: 2013 : Bitcoin’s price exceeded its moving averages by 440%. 2017 : This figure decreased to 299%. 2021 : The peak was 32% above the moving averages. Extrapolating this trend and incorporating Monte Carlo simulations yields the following projections: Median Price Peak : $200,000. Average Price Peak : $230,000, accounting for statistical variability. Implications for Investors Crosby underscores the inherent uncertainties in any predictive model, emphasizing the importance of adapting to evolving market dynamics. Factors such as institutional adoption, macroeconomic trends, and unforeseen events could significantly influence Bitcoin’s trajectory. Nonetheless, this analysis provides a rigorous, data-driven framework to inform investment strategies during the current bull cycle. Key Insights Projected Peak Date : October 19, 2025. Forecasted Price Range : A median of $200,000, with potential peaks averaging $230,000. Analytical Tools : Pi Cycle Top Indicator and Monte Carlo Simulations, powered by Bitcoin Magazine Pro data.

Surrounded by top crypto executives at the Davos event, Kganyago reportedly compared the idea of holding bitcoin in reserves to stockpiling beef or apples. Naturally, his comments started debate during a panel filled with big names like Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, who couldn’t stop talking about the “Trump effect” on crypto. Bitcoin hit an all-time high near $110,000 following Trump’s election. “The Trump effect cannot be denied here. To have the leader of the largest GDP country in the world come out undeniably and say that he wants to be the first crypto president… This is unprecedented,” Brian said. Global crypto regulations at risk because of Trump Kganyago, meanwhile, said: “I have a significant problem with a lobby that says governments should hold this asset or that asset. There is a history to gold. There was once a gold standard… If we now say ok, bitcoins. What about platinum? What about coal? Why don’t we hold strategic beef reserves, or mutton reserves, or apple reserves? Why Bitcoin? There’s nothing special about it.” Oof! The South African banker didn’t stop there. He called out the $119 million spent by crypto elites like Brian himself and Winklevoss twins on lobbying pro-crypto U.S. congressional candidates. Reportedly, he believes that this kind of influence will lead to a global “regulatory capture,” where rules are shaped by profits instead of fairness. Brian was not having it. He defended the lobbying efforts as part of a functioning democracy. “This is democracy working,” he said, insisting that crypto advocates are simply engaging with policymakers like any other industry. Hint, hint: Wall Street since its creation. Trump’s memecoin makes thing worse To make matters worse, just two days before his inauguration, president Trump announced the launch of his very own memecoin in a shocking plot twist. According to its website, 80% of the memecoin’s total supply is owned by Trump’s firm, raising ethical questions from Kganyago. Nic Carter, founding partner at Castle Island Ventures and a Trump supporter, told Politico that: “They’re plumbing new depths of idiocy with the memecoin launch,” he said, calling the move “absolutely preposterous.” The fear is simple: if investors lose big on the coin, it could tarnish both Trump’s reputation and the entire crypto industry. Democrats have already started. Rep. Sean Casten, a proud crypto hater, has accused Trump of just trying to enrich himself at the expense of his supporters. “He continues to make clear he will not let detriments to his supporters or ethics stand in the way of enriching himself,” Casten said. Despite the backlash, Trump’s sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, have launched a family crypto venture, called World Liberty Financial. And lawmakers are busy forming new subcommittees and working groups focused on digital assets, working to pass legislation that protects crypto firms from enforcement actions seen under the previous administration. Brian believes this could boost innovation, attract traditional investors and make America the crypto capital of the world, but as South Africa’s Kganyago warned, the question remains: at what cost?

The campaign will feature 150 minutes of LED ads across the 2025 season, with an estimated 110 million impressions in the UK alone. These figures exclude BBC-broadcasted matches, which typically see even higher viewership, as well as international audiences. Rugby League fans often align with the profile of potential crypto investors — they are typically well-off, brand-conscious, and community-oriented. In the UK, Sky Sports remains the primary broadcaster for the Super League and has increased its live game coverage to 170 matches for the 2025 season. The BBC adds to this with 15 live matches a year, plus highlights and regional coverage, increasing its reach in the UK. Internationally, the Super League’s reach continues to grow. For the 2024 season, broadcasting agreements were announced in key regions such as Australia, Canada, Asia, and Africa. Channels like Fox Sports, NITV, Rogers Media, Premier Sports Asia, and ESPN Africa are helping expand the league’s global footprint. Floki’s campaign will appear in approximately 50 matches throughout the Super League season, starting with major fixtures like Wigan Warriors vs. Leigh Leopards on February 13 and concluding with marquee games such as Wigan Warriors vs. Warrington Wolves in Las Vegas on March 1. Domestic TV audiences for Super League games can reach up to 600,000 viewers per match. An Untapped Space Unlike other sports saturated with crypto sponsorships, Rugby League offers a relatively untapped space, allowing Floki to stand out and forge stronger connections with fans. This lack of competition in the crypto advertising space provides Floki with the opportunity to create impactful brand associations. With the Super League’s growing global reach and dedicated fanbase, this campaign positions Floki to increase its visibility and strengthen its presence in both the sports and crypto sectors. About Floki Floki is the people’s cryptocurrency and utility token of the Floki Ecosystem. Focused on utility, community, philanthropy, and strategic marketing, Floki is working toward becoming the world’s most recognized and used cryptocurrency.

SEC Acting Chairman Mark T. Uyeda announced the initiative today and appointed Commissioner Hester Peirce to lead the task force. Senior Advisor to the Deputy Chairman Richard Gabbert and Senior Policy Advisor Taylor Asher will serve as the task force’s Chief of Staff and Chief Policy Advisor, respectively. The group will include experts from across the SEC’s divisions and offices and will collaborate with stakeholders in the public and private sectors. Related News: MicroStrategy Announces New Push to Buy Even More Bitcoin The SEC’s approach to crypto regulation has been criticized for relying heavily on enforcement actions, often leaving market participants unclear about compliance requirements. Uyeda acknowledged this challenge, saying: “To date, the SEC has regulated crypto reactively, often using new and untested legal interpretations. The result has been confusion that has stifled innovation and created an environment conducive to fraud. The SEC can do better.” The task force aims to: • Define clear regulatory boundaries for crypto assets. • Develop practical means of accounting for crypto assets. • Create sensible reporting frameworks. • Ensure judicious use of application resources. The task force will work within the framework set forth by Congress and provide technical assistance as regulatory changes are considered. It will also coordinate efforts with other federal agencies, such as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), as well as state and international regulators. *This is not investment advice.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, Grewal accuses the FDIC of being deceitful and refusing to hand over vital records pertaining to how the federal agency moved to prevent banks from offering crypto-related services. Coinbase has been using the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to uncover instances of the FDIC asking banks to freeze crypto services, known as “pause letters,” but Grewal says they are not fully complying. Coinbase-hired law firm History Associates has now filed a motion asking the federal court to intervene. Says Grewal, “A picture of deceit, obfuscation, and bad faith is coming into focus at FDIC. [This month] we’re reporting to the federal court that the agency once again stonewalled legitimate requests for information in our case and that we’re moving to amend our FOIA complaint to address their violations of law. When we filed our original request, we asked for all pause letters that were identified by the Office of Inspector General. Without telling us or the court, FDIC limited their search for pause letters to only those ‘contained’ in the report – so other pause letters may exist. When we asked them to fix their supposed ‘reasonable interpretation’ and stop playing word games, they told us it would take at least a year. Meanwhile, whistleblower reports of widespread misconduct at FDIC are growing louder and louder, with allegations of improperly labeling documents, refusing to search certain databases, and even spending tax-payer resources researching me. We asked FDIC about this, [but] they did not respond.” Grewal vows not to let up on the pursuit of the information. “I will not presume to speak for the Court or Congress. But if FDIC thinks they can win in a staring contest against Coinbase or the industry, they clearly underestimate us and our commitment to the law. We’re not going anywhere. And our lawyers aren’t going anywhere.” Last month, Grewal said the information they received so far has confirmed the notion that the US government was attempting to undermine the digital asset industry. “The letters that show Operation Chokepoint 2.0 wasn’t just some crypto conspiracy theory. FDIC is still hiding behind way overbroad redactions. And they still haven’t produced more than a fraction of them.” One example included in the documents reveals FDIC assistant regional director Joseph Meade asked an unnamed bank in Dallas, Texas, to pause its crypto activities in 2022 because the FDIC “has not determined what, if any, regulatory filings will be necessary for a bank to engage in this type of activity.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Top crypto coins including Shiba Inu (SHIB), Cardano (ADA), and AI dark horse IntelMarkets (INTL), are all displaying strong potential to generate six-figure profits for investors. However, experts believe only one of these three contending tokens would bring that much returns to investors this year. Keep reading to find out! Analysts Bullish On Shiba Inu's 2025 Price Growth In 2025, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has transformed beyond being a mere meme coin. The doggo-themed token is now expanding its dominance in the crypto market with Shibarium— its layer 2 blockchain. In spite of its high volatility, Shiba Inu has risen 126% YTD, remaining a favorite among traders. During the past year Shiba inu (SHIB) witnessed significant adoption from its price uptrends which were influenced by its token burns. Market experts, including The Moon Show, are bullish on Shiba Inu’s future. They speculate that Shiba Inu may likely witness a surge to $1 this 2025, rewarding investors with massive returns. However, this potential price growth depends on Shiba Inu's ability to deliver utility beyond its meme origins, by keeping up with upgrades and token burns. Cardano Price Set For Potential Rally Amid ADA Wallet Upgrade Cardano (ADA) is one innovative blockchain that is known for its academic accuracy and peer reviewed protocols. Remarkably, its Proof of Stake mechanism coupled with recent upgrades like Hydra and Mithryil enhances efficiency and scalability. This blockchain success has been driving adoption for ADA, and boosting Cardano price rallies since the Q4 of 2024. The Cardano price witnessed a substantial increase in the last 7 days, with ADA trading above its 50-day EMA at $1.02. This rise came amid the collaboration between Yoroi, ADA's non-custodial wallet, and renowned fintech service, Banxa. The collaboration is aimed at offering streamlined ADA purchases using cash, with added fiat to crypto banking features. Experts Highlight IntelMarkets (INTL) As The Altcoin For Six Figures Returns While the collaboration would fuel a Cardano price pump, analysts say it might not be enough to bring investors returns up to six figures. Nevertheless, they advise investors not to fret, highlighting an altcoin that has potential for such price gains. This token is none other than INTL, a fast-rising presale token about to launch. The reason behind their projection stems from INTL’s deflationary mechanism, excellent tokenomics, token burning strategy, strong community backing, as well as its solid utility on advanced AI trading platform IntelMarkets. Moreover, IntelMarkets is making a huge wave in the cryptomarket with its combination of AI with blockchain technology, poised at offering AI-driven tools and innovative DeFi solutions to users. Both institutional and average investors are jumping on INTL’s ongoing presale. This is because beyond tokenization benefits like governance and voting rights and high inter-stage returns, the token has a greater growth potential. According to experts, INTL would bring investors unprecedented returns at its official launch this 2025. This makes it the best choice for investors looking for lucrative crypto investments.

Leading the pack are Shiba Inu (SHIB), Cardano (ADA), and the promising AI-driven newcomer, IntelMarkets (INTL), all showing significant potential to yield six-figure earnings for investors. Yet, experts suggest that among these three contenders, only one is likely to deliver such substantial returns this year. Read on to see which it might be! Analysts Predict Strong Price Increase for Shiba Inu in 2025 By 2025, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has evolved beyond its origins as a meme coin. The canine-themed token is broadening its influence in the crypto sector with Shibarium, its layer 2 blockchain. Despite its notorious volatility, Shiba Inu has surged 126% year-to-date, maintaining its popularity among traders. Over the past year, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has experienced notable adoption, fueled by its price upswings and token burns. Industry experts, including those from The Moon Show, have a positive outlook on Shiba Inu's future. They predict that Shiba Inu could potentially soar to $1 in 2025, offering investors substantial returns. However, this anticipated price increase hinges on Shiba Inu's capacity to provide value beyond its meme roots, with ongoing upgrades and token burns. Cardano's Price Poised for a Surge with ADA Wallet Enhancement Cardano (ADA) is a pioneering blockchain known for its rigorous academic standards and peer-reviewed protocols. Its Proof of Stake system, along with recent upgrades like Hydra and Mithril, enhances its efficiency and scalability. This success has been propelling ADA's adoption, driving Cardano price hikes since the fourth quarter of 2024. Recently, Cardano's price saw a significant jump, with ADA trading above its 50-day EMA at $1.02. This uptick came in the wake of a partnership between Yoroi, ADA's non-custodial wallet, and the acclaimed fintech service, Banxa. Their collaboration aims to simplify ADA purchases with cash and incorporate fiat-to-crypto banking features. IntelMarkets (INTL): The Altcoin Experts Believe Could Deliver Six-Figure Returns Though the partnership may boost Cardano's price, analysts suggest it might not suffice to provide investors with six-figure returns. However, they recommend investors not to worry, highlighting an altcoin that shows promise for such gains. This token is INTL, an up-and-coming presale token nearing its launch. Their optimism is based on INTL's deflationary approach, robust tokenomics, strategic token burns, strong community support, and its practical utility on the advanced AI trading platform IntelMarkets. Furthermore, IntelMarkets is making a significant impact in the crypto market by integrating AI with blockchain technology, set to offer AI-powered tools and pioneering DeFi solutions to users. Both institutional and everyday investors are eagerly participating in INTL’s ongoing presale. This interest is driven by the token's benefits beyond just tokenization, like governance and voting rights, and the potential for high inter-stage returns. According to specialists, INTL is expected to deliver remarkable returns upon its official launch in 2025, making it an appealing option for those seeking profitable crypto ventures.

Currently priced at $0.00525 during its presale and having raised over $11.6 million, this innovative blockchain project is being added to portfolios by traders who believe it could be one of 2025’s standout performers. Here’s why Lightchain AI is being kept under wraps by those in the know. Revolutionary Approach to Blockchain At its core, Lightchain AI is designed to tackle inefficiencies that plague traditional blockchain networks. From high fees to slow transaction speeds, many existing platforms struggle to scale efficiently. Lightchain AI addresses these challenges with a highly scalable infrastructure that supports seamless integration for decentralized applications (dApps). What sets Lightchain AI apart is its focus on privacy-centric solutions. By incorporating advanced cryptographic techniques, it ensures secure transactions and data privacy, making it a top choice for industries requiring confidentiality, such as finance and healthcare. Unlike many new projects that rely on hype, Lightchain AI offers tangible solutions, setting the stage for widespread adoption across various industries. Why the Secrecy? Traders’ Strategic Advantage The crypto market thrives on early access, and Lightchain AI’s low presale price makes it an attractive prospect for high returns. Many traders prefer to keep promising projects like Lightchain AI under the radar to avoid inflating the price before securing significant positions. By quietly accumulating Lightchain AI tokens , these traders are positioning themselves for substantial gains as the project gains traction post-launch. With its innovative technology and strong market interest, Lightchain AI could become a top performer, making early adopters significant profits. Decentralized Governance as a Catalyst Lightchain AI sets itself apart with a community-driven governance model that prioritizes inclusivity. Unlike Solana, which leans heavily on developer-focused tools, Lightchain AI empowers its token holders to play an active role in platform decision-making. Through its decentralized framework, token holders can vote on key matters such as network updates, partnerships, and the platform's overall direction. The use of quadratic voting ensures fairness by amplifying the voices of smaller stakeholders while discouraging centralized control. Additionally, initiatives like developer grants and public-funded AI projects are directly supported through governance mechanisms, fostering innovation and collaboration. This unique approach ensures that Lightchain AI evolves in line with the collective goals of its community, offering a more inclusive alternative to Solana’s centralized strategy. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

39265158,https://blockworks.co/news/ethereum-foundation-governance-debate,1737482400,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/blockworks.png,Ethereum leadership and scaling debates heat up,https://blockworks.co/news/ethereum-foundation-governance-debate,"This is a segment from the 0xResearch newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . Overshadowed by this weekend’s Trump meme mania , the ongoing debates surrounding Ethereum’s future have reached fever pitch. The public discussion highlights divides between parts of the community and the Ethereum Foundation (EF). Debates touch on governance, the network’s scalability roadmap and long-term vision. One key area of debate is the governance of the EF . Critics argue that the EF’s internal structure may not be suitable for the current era. Despite its mission to decentralize, the foundation’s current centralized decision-making invites critiques of its responsiveness to competitive threats and evolving narratives. Ironically, much of the strident criticism against current executive director Aya Miyaguchi stems from a mistranslation of comments she made in a Japanese interview, which has caused considerable misunderstanding and misrepresentation of her views. Vitalik Buterin himself and other community members have called attention to the issue, emphasizing the distinction between the original Japanese article and the version promulgated on Crypto Twitter — which wrongly claimed Miyaguchi said “competing and winning” are values antithetical to Ethereum culture. (They are not.) The mistranslation is so blatant, it’s hard to imagine it wasn’t intentional. These errors in translation have fueled online bullying, which has continued despite the clarification. Some commentary has grown toxic enough to spook core devs, with pseudonymous Prysm developer Potuz commenting on the broader sentiment: “Reading twitter these last few days has made me feel that either I should just log off and keep coding or leave the space altogether.” How best to articulate Ethereum’s core mission is another sore spot. On one side, those who emphasize Ethereum as a settlement layer argue that a strong monetary premium is essential for network security. On the other side, voices like Martin Koeppelmann advocate for positioning Ethereum as a “world computer,” with a focus on transaction capacity and total fees as the main indicators of success. Such voices view ETH as “money” secondarily. Ethereum’s scalability plan via rollups continues to be questioned. We’re seeing a fresh batch of calls for more ambitious strategies to scale Ethereum mainnet — this time from within the EF itself. “If Ethereum wants to win, we need to be ambitious,” Dankrad Feist wrote Monday on X. Achieving bandwidth goals by 2026 is crucial, he argued. “We need to get to our current target of one megabyte per second in 1–2 years rather than 5, and then KEEP GOING.” That the status quo won’t cut it seems to be the emerging consensus.

I’m not here to say “I told you so.” In my Take from October 4, I did write that Donald Trump does not give a damn about Bitcoin, and in my Take from November 5 I wrote he just wants in on the crypto scam. But I didn’t mention Ross Ulbricht in either of these, largely because even I expected Trump to at least follow through on his promise to free Ross. It’s an easy promise to keep, without any real downside for Trump; after more than ten years in prison Ulbricht deserves to be free. I didn’t really expect Trump to free Ross on day one of his presidency, however. Inauguration day is quite a busy day for a new president, I’m sure. Having said that, it is what Trump himself said he would do. Of course Trump also said that he would have resolved the war in Ukraine by now — apparently they’re still fighting . Trump is a bullshitter . He will just say whatever he wants or whatever people want to hear, with no regard for the truth. He may in fact well have the most recorded lies out of any human being in history: Fact checkers from The Washington Post have for example counted over 30,000 false or misleading claims during his first term as president alone. Still, it is also true that Trump had a busy day yesterday. He signed 26 executive orders (a record amount for a first day president), and pardoned over 1500 of his supporters; those who stormed the US Capitol Building on January 6th four years ago. Yes, that means the QAnon Shaman walks free before Ross Ulbricht (H/T Trey Walsh )… but let’s just hope that Elon Musk is proven right in the next few days, and Ross will be freed too .

The Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency featured the Shiba Inu mascot of the popular Ethereum-based meme coin Dogecoin ( DOGE ) on its newly launched government website . Billionaire entrepreneur and X owner Elon Musk heads the unofficial initiative, which is focused on cutting government spending. With only 18 words on the platform and a Dogecoin poster, likely inspired by Musk’s well-known affection for the meme coin, crypto users speculated on the meaning of the unexpected addition. You might also like: MicroStrategy Bitcoin stake up to 461k with new $1.1b purchase Following the news, DOGE gained over 4% in the past 24 hours. However, the coin’s rally was likely part of a broader market upswing, as nearly every cryptocurrency in the top 10 by market cap (excluding stablecoins) turned green in the past hour. Meanwhile, the Department of Government Efficiency has had a rocky start. Vivek Ramaswamy, the organization’s co-leader and a Bitcoin ( BTC ) advocate, announced his departure from the department just one day after Trump’s inauguration. Sources suggest that the former presidential candidate may shift his focus to running for Ohio governor. If true, Ohio could soon be led by a pro-Bitcoin official.

While SHIB’s future remains uncertain, investors are shifting their focus to more promising projects like XRP and Lightchain AI . Lightchain AI , in particular, has captured attention with its innovative blockchain-AI integration and an impressive $11.7 million raised in its presale. But how do these tokens stack up when it comes to long-term growth potential? Shiba Inu (SHIB) - Will It Bounce Back or Decline? Shiba Inu (SHIB) has experienced a 13% price increase since the start of 2025, aligning with the broader cryptocurrency market trend. However, on-chain data indicates a decrease in the average holding time of transacted coins, suggesting rising selling pressure. This trend is supported by the In/Out of Money Around Price (IOMAP) metric, which shows significant resistance between $0.000024 and $0.000027. Technical indicators, such as the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), have turned negative, indicating bearish momentum. If SHIB's price falls below the $0.000024 support level, it could decline toward $0.000022, with the potential to drop below $0.000020 if selling pressure intensifies. Conversely, breaking above $0.000026 could invalidate this bearish outlook. XRP - Stability Amid Regulatory Challenges XRP, the digital asset tied to Ripple Labs, continues to prove its resilience despite facing significant regulatory hurdles. In August 2024, Ripple was ordered to pay a reduced $125 million penalty for the improper sale of XRP tokens—a major win compared to the SEC's original $2 billion demand. But Ripple isn’t just playing defense. By December 2024, it scored a big victory with final approval from the New York Department of Financial Services for its stablecoin, RLUSD. This move could boost XRP's utility and market appeal, positioning Ripple for growth despite the challenges ahead. However, the regulatory saga isn’t over. The SEC’s decision to appeal the July 2023 ruling—declaring XRP sold on public exchanges was not a security—reintroduces uncertainty to the crypto giant's future. As of January 18, 2025, XRP trades at $3.14, down a slight 0.05422% from the previous close, with an intraday high of $3.34 and a low of $3.14. This price stability in the face of legal battles highlights one key takeaway - investors still believe in XRP's potential as a major player in the evolving crypto landscape. Lightchain AI Trailblazer in Blockchain Innovation Lightchain AI is redefining the blockchain landscape by focusing on artificial intelligence and decentralized solutions. A standout feature of the platform is its commitment to open-source innovation , encouraging developers worldwide to contribute to its ecosystem. This collaborative approach ensures continuous improvement and adaptability, making it a highly dynamic project.

With SHIB’s future in question, investors are turning their attention to potentially more lucrative opportunities like XRP and Lightchain AI . Lightchain AI has particularly stood out with its cutting-edge integration of blockchain and AI, raising an impressive $11.7 million during its presale phase. But how do these tokens compare in terms of long-term potential? Shiba Inu (SHIB) - Rebound or Further Decline? Since the start of 2025, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen a 13% rise in value, reflecting the overall trend in the cryptocurrency sector. However, data reveals a shortening of the average holding period for transacted coins, pointing to increased selling pressure. The In/Out of Money Around Price (IOMAP) metric supports this, indicating notable resistance in the $0.000024 to $0.000027 range. Technical indicators like the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) have turned negative, suggesting a bearish trend. Should SHIB's price break below the $0.000024 support level, it might slide to $0.000022, with the possibility of dropping under $0.000020 if selling pressure mounts. Conversely, surpassing $0.000026 could challenge this bearish scenario. XRP - Holding Strong Amid Legal Battles Despite significant regulatory challenges, XRP, associated with Ripple Labs, continues to demonstrate its robustness. In August 2024, a court required Ripple to pay a reduced $125 million penalty related to XRP sales, a substantial victory compared to the SEC's initial $2 billion request. Ripple is not just on the defensive. By December 2024, it achieved a major win by securing final approval from the New York Department of Financial Services for its stablecoin, RLUSD. This development could enhance XRP's functionality and attractiveness in the market, setting the stage for growth despite ongoing challenges. However, the regulatory saga continues as the SEC's decision to appeal the July 2023 ruling—which stated XRP sold on public exchanges was not a security—adds a layer of uncertainty to Ripple's future. As of January 18, 2025, XRP's price stands at $3.14, reflecting a slight 0.05422% decrease from the previous closing, with an intraday range between $3.34 and $3.14. This stability amidst legal issues underscores a crucial point: investors maintain confidence in XRP's role as a significant entity in the evolving crypto world. Lightchain AI: Leading the Way in Blockchain and AI Lightchain AI is making waves by combining blockchain technology with artificial intelligence and decentralized solutions. A key aspect of the platform is its dedication to open-source innovation , which welcomes global developers to enhance its ecosystem.

Bonk ( BONK ) rose by 6.5%, making it one of the best-performing Solana ( SOL ) meme coins. The token has climbed about 26% in the past seven days. This rebound came after Rex Shares, an asset management firm with over $8 billion in assets under management, filed an ETF application. The company also applied for other crypto ETFs, including those tied to Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana, Ripple ( XRP ), and Dogecoin. Analysts believe that the Paul Atkins -led Securities and Exchange Commission will be more open to approving spot crypto ETFs. Gary Gensler, Atkins’ predecessor, had focused mainly on Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. It remains unclear, however, whether the SEC will approve funds for meme coins like Bonk. Crypto ETFs have gained significant traction among institutional investors. Bitcoin ETFs have attracted over $35 billion in inflows, while Ethereum funds have pulled in over $2.66 billion. However, most institutions are expected to avoid allocating significant funds to meme coins like Bonk. Launched in 2022, Bonk has grown into one of the largest meme coins, boasting a market cap of over $2.3 billion. Still, it faces increasing competition from other Solana-based meme coins like Fartcoin, Dogwifhat, and Gigachad. You might also like: BONK price falls over 7% after burning 1.69 trillion tokens-what’s going on? Bonk price analysis: can it 10x from here? BONK price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that Bonk’s price peaked at $0.00006 in December before dropping sharply to $0.00002490, forming a double-bottom pattern. A double-bottom is a widely recognized bullish reversal indicator. Bonk has also created a falling wedge chart pattern, another popular bullish reversal setup. The coin has moved above its 50-day and 100-day moving averages and is gradually forming a bullish engulfing candlestick pattern. As a result, the coin is likely to experience a bullish breakout, pointing to further gains. The next level to watch is its 2024 high of $0.000060, which represents a potential 77% upside from the current price. For Bonk’s price to 10x from here, it would need to reach $0.00033, which is approximately 900% above its current level. While such a move is theoretically possible, achieving this target is likely to take several years.

The decision highlights the company’s focus on diversifying its financial holdings by incorporating blockchain-based opportunities, such as Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ), according to a company release. CEO Jay Madhu emphasized Bitcoin’s reliability as a store of value, pointing to its increasing adoption and price stability. “Our Board of Directors believes that Bitcoin, in particular, has demonstrated its reliability as a store of value amid rising global adoption, supported by significant price appreciation and growing investor confidence,” said Madhu. This move aligns with Oxbridge’s broader blockchain initiatives, led by its Web3 -focused subsidiary, SurancePlus Inc. SurancePlus is working to transform access to reinsurance investments through tokenization and decentralization. As part of these efforts, SurancePlus plans to launch two new tokens tied to upcoming reinsurance contracts: one targeting a 20% return and another high-yield option aimed at a 42% return. Both tokens will be backed by reinsurance contracts facilitated through Oxbridge’s sidecar vehicle, Oxbridge Re NS.

In their announcement on Jan. 21, the TON Foundation and Telegram revealed that the TON blockchain will now exclusively support Telegram’s mini apps. As part of this growing ecosystem, popular game projects are launching on the Toncoin ( TON )-powered blockchain. Tap-to-earn games like Hamster Kombat and Notcoin, which gained signficant traction on Telegram in 2024, are among the highlights. What does this mean? With this expanded collaboration, TON has become the blockchain infrastructure for Telegram mini apps. Apps currently not using TON must transition to the network by February 21, 2025. Projects opting to migrate will benefit from technical support, streamlined user onboarding, and marketing assistance. The TON Foundation has also introduced grants of up to $50,000 in ad credits to support project migration efforts. This collaboration is expected to drive fresh adoption of TON across Telegram’s vast user base of 950 million monthly active users. To facilitate this, TON Connect will become the exclusive wallet for mini apps, except in cases involving bridging. You might also like: Telegram-linked TON eyeing U.S. expansion The Open Network initially started as Telegram Open Network in 2017, with Telegram raising $1.7 billion to develop a blockchain-based decentralized platform. However, following regulatory challenges with the SEC, Telegram abandoned the project in 2020. In 2021, a community of developers revived the initiative, launching the TON blockchain mainnet. By 2023, Telegram and the TON Foundation partnered to support the network’s growth, with Telegram enabling Toncoin payments. The partnership marks the beginning of TON’s next phase of growth, TON Foundation president Manuel Stotz said in a statement. “After laying foundational groundwork over the last years, TON is now ready for explosive growth in 2025. The re-energized, deepened, and exclusive partnership with Telegram is an important step in our roadmap,”Stotz noted Growth initiatives include leveraging the TON blockchain for asset tokenization, such as emojis and stickers. Telegram also plans to introduce tokenized gifts on the blockchain through NFTs.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Shiba Inu and Pepe Coin recover, but Rollblock shines after raising $8.9M in its presale. Table of Contents Rollblock presale moves closer to $9 million SHIB whale activities drive it up PEPE attracts massive investments to rediscover form Conclusion No matter where the market turns, Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe Coin (P E PE) remain top targets for meme coin investors. Both coins have been moving upward recently after the price recovery across the broader crypto market. The SHIB price has seen an improvement to an 18% decline in the past month. PEPE’s monthly decline has also reduced to around 21%. However, experts are tipping Rollblock, a new altcoin, as the best crypto to buy this period. After raising $8.9 million in its presale, they are convinced RBLK will make light work of SHIB’s and PEPE’s gains in the coming months. Let’s find out why. Rollblock presale moves closer to $9 million While there are doubts about the potential for SHIB and PEPE to be 20x or more, Rollblock already set the pace for massive gains during its presale. The Rollblock presale has crossed $8.9 million and $9 million is now within reach. Investors are bullish on RBLK due to the project pulling innovative features into the iGaming industry. The Rollblock Casino is transforming online gambling by building its systems on blockchain technology, eliminating online gaming issues like lack of transparency and unfair house advantage. Backed by blockchain, its entire gaming system can be audited by anyone, so players and investors can confirm revenues, return-to-player (RTP) rates, and winnings. Moreover, Rollblock adds an extra layer of excitement to its ecosystem with decentralized finance (DeFi) investment opportunities for passive investors. These include a Rollblock staking program with up to 30% annual percentage yield (APY). Plus, there’s a revenue-sharing system that returns a percentage of the casino’s weekly profits to Rollblock token holders. SHIB whale activities drive it up The SHIB price has been down for a good part of the month, falling by about 20%. However, there’s been a rediscovery in the past week. After increased whale activities, the SHIB price has slightly backed up from a low point of $0.000018 to $0.000022 within the past month. There’s also been a surge in the SHIB trading volume within the same period caused by a positive in-flow of investments within the SHIB ecosystem. Despite the increase in SHIB price and investor interest, the meme coin is yet to experience any significant breakout suggesting it can 20x its gains in the coming months. PEPE attracts massive investments to rediscover form Like SHIB, PEPE has also been on a journey to rediscovery over the past few days. The PEPE price may be down by over 20% in the past month and lost its previous gains, but the recent increase suggests a change in investor sentiment. Consequently, the PEPE price has moved from a low price of $0.000014 to $0.000019 within the past month. This suggests a massive whale accumulation that may continually drive up the meme coin’s price. However, it’s unlikely that PEPE will have a 20x surge under its belt in the coming months. Conclusion Rollblock’s exciting features and highly rewarding initiatives have boosted its presence in the GambleFi market. The altcoin is already doing great numbers and is tipped as the best crypto to buy thanks to its potential pumps during and after the initial coin offering (ICO). Interested investors can buy in now at a low price of $0.045 to take advantage of the project’s potential. For more information, visit the Rollblock presale website and join the online community.

Circle, the provider of crypto’s second-largest stablecoin ( USDC ), has acquired Hashnote, the company behind the $1.3 billion on-chain money market USYC. This expansion into tokenized products will integrate Hashnote’s U.S. Yield Coin with USDC, addressing “an enormous and immediate opportunity to bring yield-bearing collateral into crypto market structure,” Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire said in a statement. Hashnote, which launched in February 2023, was financed by a $5 million investment from Cumberland Labs, a crypto venture startup backed by institutional trading firm DRW. As more and more institutions get involved in the digital asset market, we are taking what are common practices in traditional finance and importing those onchain, but with the incredible super powers of global, real-time settlement, programmability and composability. Indeed, one of the holy grails of capital markets is the ability to move between cash and collateral instantly. Jeremy Allaire, Circle CEO You might also like: News Circle CEO pushes Trump to scrap SEC rule hindering banks from holding crypto Circle has also partnered with crypto market maker Cumberland, an offshoot of DRW, to enhance liquidity and operations for USDC and USYC, aiming to attract more institutional participants in the digital asset space. Additionally, Circle plans to issue its USDC stablecoin on Canton, a decentralized network designed to settle private transactions. Allaire stated that USYC’s presence on Canton will enable “24/7/365 convertibility between collateral and cash for use in TradFi markets on-chain.” The $3.5 billion tokenization market continues to gain attention from crypto users, institutions, and regulators. Tokenization leverages blockchain technology to mint real-world assets as digital tokens, enabling traders to access these products on-chain. According to Fortune, the global tokenization market could jump to a $13 billion ecosystem by 2032.

However, the price declined sharply after hitting its latest milestone as selling pressure yanked BTC to an intraday low of $100,173 during the ongoing session. US To Hit Debt Ceiling. Will Bitcoin Soar Or Suffer? The US is expected to hit its $36 trillion debt ceiling on Tuesday, effectively barring it from borrowing from the public to fund operations. While opinion is divided on its impact, analysts suggest it could be a positive development for risk assets and Bitcoin (BTC) . Outgoing Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in an official announcement, “The debt limit does not authorize new spending, but it creates a risk that the federal government might not be able to finance its existing legal obligations that Congresses and Presidents of both parties have made in the past.” Yellen suggested the Treasury would take extraordinary measures to prevent a government shutdown, buying time until at least March 14. One measure to mitigate the crisis could be running down the Treasury General Account (TGA), the government’s operating account at the Fed, which is used to collect taxes, customs duties, proceeds from the sale of securities, and public debt receipts. The government previously used the TGA to meet expenses in 2023, which had a positive impact on risk assets like BTC . Is MicroStrategy Planning Another Bitcoin (BTC) Purchase? MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor hinted at more moves in the market following Donald Trump’s inauguration, posting a cryptic statement and an image of the company’s portfolio tracker. Historically, such statements are followed by new BTC acquisitions by MicroStrategy. The firm’s BTC holdings are valued at a staggering $47 billion. MicroStrategy shares have seen a substantial increase over the past six months. The firm’s strategic investment in BTC has complemented its impressive performance. MicroStrategy currently holds around 450,000 BTC . Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) surged to a new all-time high Monday leading up to Donald Trump’s inauguration. However, it rapidly declined after hitting $109,350 as selling pressure drove the price lower. BTC has been bullish since last week after recovering from Monday’s intraday low of $89,397. The price recovered as buyers bought the dip, allowing it to reclaim $90,000. BTC ultimately settled at $94,492 before registering a substantial jump of 2.19% on Tuesday to move past the 20-day SMA and settle at $96,566. Bullish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as BTC crossed the 50-day SMA and $100,000 to settle at $100,050. However, it lost momentum on Thursday as sellers drove the price to an intraday low of $97,094. BTC recovered from this level to settle at $99,798, registering only a marginal decline. Source: TradingView Bullish sentiment returned on Friday as BTC rose nearly 4% to reclaim $100,000 and settle at $103,732. However, momentum waned on Saturday, allowing sellers to take control. As a result, BTC registered a marginal decline and settled at $103,579. The price experienced substantial volatility on Sunday, rising to an intraday high of $106,552 before losing momentum, allowing sellers to take control. As a result, BTC dropped just over 2% to end the weekend at $101,434. BTC surged to a new all-time high on Monday as it went past $105,000 to reach $109,350. However, bulls lost momentum after reaching this level as BTC quickly plummeted to $102,408, registering an increase of nearly 1%. Sellers attempted to drive BTC below $100,000 during the ongoing session. As a result, BTC dropped to an intraday low of $100,173. However, it has recovered since and is up 0.50%, trading around $102,977. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The first-mover advantage to take — don’t wait until the crowd rushes in. Dogecoin Dogecoin (DOGE) has increased by 10.85% over the past week. In the past month, it rose by 17.13%, and over six months, it climbed 184.84%. Currently trading between $0.30 and $0.43, DOGE shows a steady upward trend. The nearest resistance level is at $0.49. If DOGE breaks this point, it might reach the second resistance at $0.62, marking a significant rise from its current price. On the downside, the nearest support is at $0.24. A drop below this could see the price falling to the next support at $0.1163. Technical indicators offer a mixed outlook. The 10-day simple moving average is $0.37, slightly below the 100-day average of $0.39. The Relative Strength Index is 47.28, suggesting the coin is neither overbought nor oversold. The MACD level is marginally negative at -0.0021, indicating a slight bearish momentum. Based on these factors, DOGE’s price might stabilize before making a decisive move. Pepe Pepe (PEPE) has experienced significant price changes recently. In the past week, its price decreased by 8.03%. Over the last month, it fell by 7.63%. Despite these declines, over the past six months, the price has risen by 30.28%. The current price ranges from $0.0000138007 to $0.0000196567. The 10-day simple moving average is $0.0000165657, while the 100-day average stands at $0.0000182279. The current price is below the 100-day average, which may indicate a bearish trend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 44.72, suggesting the coin is neither overbought nor oversold. The MACD level is negative at -0.0000001966, pointing to potential downward momentum. These indicators hint that the price might continue to face pressure in the near term. The nearest resistance level is at $0.0000232693. To reach this point from the current price, the coin would need to rise by about 39%. The nearest support level is at $0.0000115573, which is roughly 31% below the current price. If the price moves upwards, breaking the resistance could signal further growth. If it falls to the support level, it might stabilize there. The second resistance and support levels are at $0.0000291253 and $0.0000057013, respectively, indicating the potential range the price could move in the future. Bonk Bonk (BONK) has experienced mixed performance recently. In the past week, its price increased by 21.51%, showing strong short-term momentum. Over the last month, the price remained almost flat with a slight decrease of 0.08%. Looking back six months, BONK’s price rose by 18.35%, indicating moderate long-term growth. Currently trading between $0.00002455 and $0.00004014, BONK is approaching its nearest resistance level at $0.00004781. If it breaks above this point, it could climb to the next resistance at $0.00006340, which would be an increase of over 50% from current prices. On the downside, the nearest support level is at $0.00001663. A drop to this level would mean a decline of about 30% from the current price range. Technical indicators offer mixed signals. The 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages are close at $0.00003268 and $0.00003206, suggesting a stable trend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 51.75, indicating the coin is neither overbought nor oversold. The stochastic oscillator is high at 75.90, which might signal a potential price decrease. However, the positive MACD level of 4.976e-8 points to bullish momentum. Based on these factors, BONK could either rise if it breaks resistance or fall if downward pressure prevails. Floki Inu FLOKI (FLOKI) has been on a downward trend over the past six months. In the last week, its price dropped by 8.99%. Over the past month, it decreased by 16.32%. Looking at the six-month period, the price has fallen by 20.07%. Currently, the price ranges between $0.00012700 and $0.00017672. Technical indicators show mixed signals. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 44.68, indicating neutral momentum. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $0.00014922, which is below the 100-day average of $0.00016739. This suggests short-term weakness. The MACD level is negative at -0.000002427, pointing to bearish sentiment. The Stochastic oscillator is at 59.46, neither in overbought nor oversold territory. The nearest resistance level is $0.00020887. If the price rises to this point, it would be an increase of about 39% from the current level. On the downside, the closest support is at $0.00010943, which is roughly 27% below the current price. Breaking above the second resistance at $0.00025859 could signal significant growth, amounting to a 72% increase. Conversely, dropping to the second support at $0.00005971 would mean a substantial decline of around 60%. These levels are key areas to watch for potential price movements.

Alphractal’s analysis points to increasing selling pressure in the market, but claims that buying pressure is strong enough to potentially push Bitcoin’s price higher. However, the analytics firm compared the performance of low-cap tokens with high-cap tokens in the cryptocurrency market. According to the analytics firm, high-cap altcoins tend to move away from their 50-day or 200-day moving averages more. Although crypto users prefer smaller and newer assets for further upside, Alphractal argues that the data points elsewhere.

Large community: Large-scale projects are supported by well-established investors and supporters. High liquidity: Thanks to high liquidity, volatility decreases, trading becomes easier and a safer environment is created for traders. Solid projects: Typically have more solid developers and clear goals. While Alphractal analysts ultimately acknowledge that smaller altcoins can offer the opportunity for high returns, they believe that a balanced portfolio of large-cap cryptocurrencies with sufficient liquidity and strong fundamentals can yield better results in the long run. According to the analysts, portfolio diversification can provide the upside of both sides. *This is not investment advice.

Initially capped at 200 million coins, the supply will expand to 1 billion over the next three years. The coin’s website disclaimer notes that $TRUMP is not an investment or linked to any political campaign. The coin saw a massive trading volume of $36.15 billion in 24 hours. Meanwhile, Melania Trump introduced her own cryptocurrency, $MELANIA, on Sunday, also built on the Solana blockchain, with Trump retweeting her announcement. As the cryptocurrency world watches the rise of $TRUMP and $MELANIA meme coins, a new contender is making waves in the market: $PEPETO. This frog-inspired token, dubbed “The God of Frogs,” is positioning itself as the next big opportunity for crypto investors. With a presale already surpassing $3.7 million and innovative features like high staking rewards and cross-chain technology, $PEPETO is poised to challenge its political-themed rivals and redefine the meme coin space. The $TRUMP & $MELANIA Phenomenon In a dramatic move ahead of his inauguration, President-elect Donald Trump launched the $TRUMP token, quickly amassing a market cap of over $9 billion. Early investors made millions, with one whale turning $12 million into $23.8 million within hours. $MELANIA, launched by the First Lady-to-be, followed suit, gaining traction thanks to its association with the Trump brand. However, both tokens have faced criticism for their lack of utility and concerns over market manipulation. With 80% of $TRUMP tokens controlled by Trump-affiliated organizations, skeptics question its long-term viability. $PEPETO: The Utility-Driven Meme Coin Revolution While $TRUMP and $MELANIA bask in their initial hype, $PEPETO is quietly building an ecosystem designed for sustainability and growth. Here’s why analysts and whales are turning their attention to this rising star: Staking Rewards: Offering an impressive 387% annual return, $PEPETO provides investors with a lucrative passive income opportunity. Cross-Chain Bridge: Pepeto’s cutting-edge technology allows seamless transfers between major blockchains, reducing transaction times from 15 minutes to 30 seconds. PepetoSwap Exchange: This zero-fee platform is set to revolutionize meme coin trading by addressing high fees and liquidity fragmentation. Community-Driven Governance: $PEPETO empowers investors with decision-making authority through its DAO model, fostering trust and transparency. Affordable Entry Point: At just $0.000000105 per token in its presale phase, $PEPETO offers an attractive entry for seasoned and new investors.

Investors Are Flocking To This XRP Rival Instead,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/ripple-price-prediction-can-xrp-hit-50-investors-are-flocking-to-this-xrp-rival-instead,"Ripple’s XRP has demonstrated resilience over the past few days as it approaches the possibility of reversing its recent correction. The token has recovered well from mounting selling pressure experienced in the past week and is currently hovering above the $3 level. Following its successful recovery, investors have rekindled confidence in the asset’s upward trajectory, offering additional support for the bullish reversal. While Ripple (XRP) showcases great long-term promise, Remittix (RTX) is the one to watch in 2025. Its creative crypto-to-fiat conversion platform is about to reinvent cross-border payments as we know it. This DeFi coin has already raised over $4 million in ICO revenue, highlighting its growing demand. Therefore, it can potentially surge by as much as 10x this quarter. XRP Price Prediction: Can It Reach $5 Before February XRP price has been holding gains above its 50-day and 100-day EMAs, solidifying its strong position in the bullish trend. It has also hovered above the $2.65 level, which was resistance-turned-support and could serve as a strong base for future price increases. Its relative strength index is moving upwards toward 70, indicating more room for growth, but the overbought zone is still accessible. Notably, the price of XRP will likely encounter resistance at the $3.35 region. A successful close above this level could lead to a retest of recent highs around the $3.50 level. This scenario would validate the broader market's bullish trends, which could attract more investors. If the XRP token fails to maintain its upward trajectory , a slip toward the $3 and $2.80 levels could occur. The altcoin's ability to bounce back from corrections is a massive selling point as market sentiments remain positive. The $3.35 resistance level becomes critical to determining the token’s next big move. However, XRP's price performance over the last day suggests it is in a strong position to attain further growth. Its recent over 30% spike highlights massive bullish momentum. XRP's capacity to hold onto its support and confront the resistance level will determine whether this rally develops into a legitimate extension of its upward trajectory. Remittix (RTX) Offers Revolutionary Payment Solution Ripple (XRP) might be the top gainer among altcoins, but Remittix’s RTX token is about to transform cross-border payments. Dubbed the future of financial empowerment with its crypto-to-fiat transaction network, Remittix has bridged the gap between TradFi and DeFi. For context, Remittix is built on a blockchain-based system that enables instant transaction settlements with zero intermediaries. It lets users send funds directly from their crypto wallet to a recipient’s bank account. There are no extra charges outside the platform's flat fee―meaning what users send is what the recipient will receive. Moreover, the process makes it possible for recipients to receive their money in the preferred fiat currency without ever knowing that it originated as a cryptocurrency transaction, making it more convenient and easier to use. All transactions on Remittix are stored in a public ledger, ensuring traceability and transparency. Remittix Pay API has empowered businesses to adopt crypto payments and settle transactions in fiat to any approved bank account worldwide. This functionality allows merchants to handle their financials and accept over 30 fiat and 50 crypto pairs. Notably, Remittix has been audited by reputable blockchain firms BlockSAFU and SolidProof, assuring users of its reliability as a secure PayFi solution. Priced at just $0.0228, RTX has sold over 220 million tokens and raised over $4 million, a remarkable testament to its growing demand. With a unique blend of blockchain efficiency with real-world utility, market participants expect Remittix to be 50x in the next few months. As such, it could become a prominent participant in the financial space, offering significant profit potential for early backers. Which Token Could Soar Higher In Q1: XRP or RTX XRP price could remain volatile in the short term due to resistance at the $3.35 level. Meanwhile, Remittix presale continues gaining momentum as more investors flock in after experiencing another price increase and unveiling 30% deposit bonuses.

Investors Are Turning to This XRP Competitor,https://bitzo.com/2025/01/ripple-price-prediction-will-xrp-reach-50-investors-are-turning-to-this-xrp-competitor,"Ripple’s XRP has shown impressive resilience over recent days, nearing the possibility of reversing its latest downturn. The token has bounced back from the increased selling pressure of the previous week and is now maintaining a position above the $3 mark. This recovery has reignited investor confidence in the asset's potential upward movement, providing further support for a bullish reversal. While Ripple (XRP) presents strong long-term potential, Remittix (RTX) is the one to keep an eye on for 2025. Its innovative crypto-to-fiat conversion platform is set to transform cross-border payments fundamentally. This DeFi coin has already generated over $4 million through its ICO, indicating its rising demand. Consequently, it might increase by up to 10x this quarter. XRP Price Outlook: Can It Hit $5 Before February? XRP has been maintaining its gains above the 50-day and 100-day EMAs, reinforcing its strong position within the bullish trend. The token has also remained above the $2.65 mark, which has shifted from a resistance level to a support, potentially serving as a solid foundation for future price hikes. With its relative strength index climbing towards 70, there is room for growth, although it remains close to the overbought territory. Importantly, XRP is expected to face resistance around the $3.35 area. If XRP successfully closes above this point, it might retest the recent peaks near the $3.50 mark. This could confirm the overall bullish trends in the market, drawing in more investors. However, if the XRP token fails to sustain its upward momentum , it could slide back towards the $3 and $2.80 levels. The token's ability to recover from corrections is a significant selling point as market sentiment remains optimistic. The $3.35 resistance level is crucial for determining XRP's next significant move. However, XRP's recent performance suggests it is well-positioned for further growth. Its recent surge of over 30% underlines substantial bullish momentum. Whether XRP can hold its support and overcome the resistance level will determine if this rally evolves into a genuine continuation of its upward path. Remittix (RTX) Pioneers a New Payment Approach Although Ripple (XRP) is leading among altcoins, Remittix’s RTX token is set to revolutionize cross-border payments. Promoted as the future of financial empowerment through its crypto-to-fiat transaction network, Remittix closes the gap between traditional and decentralized finance. Built on a blockchain system, Remittix facilitates instant transaction settlements without any intermediaries, allowing users to transfer funds directly from their crypto wallets to recipients' bank accounts. With no additional fees beyond the platform's flat rate, what users send is exactly what recipients receive. Additionally, recipients can collect their funds in the preferred fiat currency without knowing the transaction originated in cryptocurrency, making it more user-friendly. Every transaction on Remittix is recorded on a public ledger, ensuring transparency and traceability. The Remittix Pay API enables businesses to adopt crypto payments and settle transactions in fiat to any approved bank account worldwide. This capability allows merchants to manage their finances and accept over 30 fiat and 50 crypto pairs. Remittix has been audited by respected blockchain firms BlockSAFU and SolidProof, providing users with confidence in its security as a PayFi solution. Priced at just $0.0228, RTX has sold over 220 million tokens and raised more than $4 million, showcasing its increasing demand. By combining blockchain efficiency with practical utility, market participants anticipate Remittix could grow 50x in the upcoming months. Consequently, it may become a key player in the financial sector, offering significant profit opportunities for early investors. Which Token Could Skyrocket in Q1: XRP or RTX? XRP's price might remain volatile in the near term due to the resistance at $3.35. Meanwhile, the Remittix presale is gaining traction as more investors join following another price rise and the announcement of 30% deposit bonuses. As a result, Remittix might offer superior returns in Q1.

Its latest plunge coincides with the overall market decline following Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20. What Might Ignite a Rally? Shiba Inu (SHIB) experienced a significant pump in mid-January, reaching a local peak of around $0.00002485 (per CoinMarketCap’s data). Since then, though, it has been on a downfall, currently trading at roughly $0.000021. SHIB Price, Source: CMC Its underperformance coincides with the broader decline of the cryptocurrency market , which occurred shortly after Donald Trump’s inauguration. While some industry participants expected him to mention the digital asset industry in his speech, the Republican did not say a single word on the topic . This might explain why numerous tokens (including SHIB) are in the red today (January 21). Nonetheless , some essential factors signal that the popular meme coin could experience a new bull run soon. One of those is the burning mechanism, which aims to reduce SHIB’s circulating supply and potentially make it more valuable through scarcity. Over the past 24 hours, the burn rate has exploded by 500%, resulting in approximately 2.8 million tokes sent to a null address. Next on the list is the uptrend of TREAT. The Shiba Inu-related coin, which is designed to enhance utility and engagement across the network’s projects and serve as a reward token within the ecosystem, officially saw the light of day on January 14. While TREAT has been underperforming in the past week, its price soared by over 50% in the last 24 hours, rising to as high as $0.013. It retraced to the current $0.0082 in the following hours but remains in green territory. Being closely connected to Shiba Inu, the potential further advancement of TREAT may positively affect the second-biggest meme coin. Third, we will focus on SHIB’s exchange netflow , which has been negative for the past four days. This development signals a shift from centralized exchanges toward self-custody methods, which could be considered bullish since it reduces the immediate selling pressure. Bonus: DOGE’s Influence It is worth mentioning that SHIB’s potential short-term rally could also be propelled by Dogecoin’s price performance. DOGE is the undisputed leader in the meme coin niche, and its rivals sometimes mimic its price swings. Most recently, its valuation briefly exploded by double digits after the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) featured the meme coin’s logo on its official website. It will be interesting to see whether the asset will thrive under the new US presidency and how it will affect the rest of the memes.

As Ethereum loses market cap and mindshare to competitors, the foundation has been beset by scandal. Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum's co-founder and chief figurehead, has laid out a new plan to right the ship. ""We are indeed currently in the process of large changes to EF leadership structure, which has been ongoing for close to a year,"" Buterin said in an X post . ""Some of this has already been executed on and made public, and some is still in progress."" In his X post outlining the changes, Buterin listed a series of goals, including improving the ""technical expertise within EF leadership"" and improving ""two-way communications and ties between EF leadership and the ecosystem actors"" that it supports. According to Buterin, the changes won't be designed to centralize, corporatize or politicize the foundation. The organization won't suddenly ""[s]tart aggressively lobbying regulators and powerful political figures,"" he said, nor would it ""[b]ecome an arena for vested interests [...] or even more of a 'main character' within Ethereum."" The shake-up comes as Ethereum's reputation among builders has soured in recent months. Members of the broader crypto community are flocking to fast and cheap competitors like Solana, which has been quicker to accommodate the recent memecoin fervor. Some say Ethereum has lagged because it lacks an organizing vision — something the foundation, while not ""in charge"" of Ethereum, might have helped remedy. Over the past 12 months, the foundation has been mired in controversy. It has weathered accusations of being ineffectual, yet also too powerful. Conflict-of-interest scandals haven't helped, either: Payments from private companies to foundation employees recently sparked wide backlash and forced the organization to update its policies. Some have blamed Aya Miyaguchi, the foundation's executive director since 2018, for the foundation's woes. Amid a pressure campaign for Miyaguchi's removal, Buterin has stepped in as the Ethereum Foundation's sole decision-maker. ""The person deciding the new EF leadership team is me,"" he stated on X. ""One of the goals of the ongoing reform is to give the EF a 'proper board', but until that happens it's me."" Miyaguchi, however, has not been ousted from the foundation. Buterin lambasted some of her critics on X, accusing them of using her as a ""scapegoat."" In multiple tweets, Buterin highlighted certain particularly inflammatory social media comments — including death threats and explicit calls for more bullying of Miyaguchi — and called them ""pure evil."" ""If you 'keep the pressure on', then you are creating an environment that is actively toxic to top talent,"" Buterin wrote. ""Some of Ethereum's best devs have been messaging me recently, expressing their disgust with the social media environment that people like you are creating. YOU ARE MAKING MY JOB HARDER.""",Tech|Ethereum|Ethereum Foundation|Vitalik Buterin,EN,0,0,ETH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|SOL,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-21 19:33:34

CA Aishwary Gupta, Global Head of Payments at Polygon Labs revealed the launch of native wallet, powered by Polygon Labs PoS Blockchain network, on Jio Sphere. Jio Sphere, the first Indian web browser developed by Jio Platforms, will have this Polygon integrated wallet where Jio Coins will reside. Though the partnership between the JPL and Polygon was announced last week, it has been revealed that the deliberations and discussions were going on for the past one and half years. Polygon has been closely working with Reliance on finding ways to develop and enable some of the Web3 products into Jio’s ecosystems. How will users earn Jio Coins As of Tuesday, Jio Sphere users have begun to notice Jio Coins on their smartphones. The support of Polygon protocol will ensure smooth and efficient transactions for the users. The token built on top of Ethereum layer 2, listed on Polygon Labs, can be earned by users based on their surfing activities on Jio Sphere. After earning these Web3 tokens, users will receive their tokens on Jio Sphere. What are the potential uses of Jio Coins Though as of now, Jio Coins are non-transferable and non-redeemable, experts suggest that Reliance can use them to create a close-loop economy. Jio Coins’ exact value is still unclear. With the Reliance conglomerate having its mega presence in telecom, energy and details sectors, Jio Coins are suggested to be used for making Jio mobile recharges, payments at Reliance gas stations or for any purchases within the Jio network. Few have also called Jio Token as the replication of Basic Attention Token (BAT) which is used as a reward by the privacy-focused Brave browser. Speculations are up that JioTokens can be used by the conglomerate for incentivising user engagement – to make it an innovative advertisement model in the Indian markets. Watershed moment for Indian Blockchain Industry Considering the fact that the Indian regulatory environment for Blockchain and crypto industry is delicate, the growth prospects of JioCoins remain under shadows. After the WazirX Scam, the Indian government has imposed a 30% tax on gains from virtual digital assets with 1% TDS (Tax Deduction at Source) – highlighting the challenging environment for the development of the Blockchain environment in India. Nonetheless, this partnership of Jio Platforms with Polygon can be deemed as a watershed moment in the development of Indian Blockchain Industry. Though launched in the challenging environment, the prospects opened up by the entry of Reliance’s Jio Platforms in the crypto space will make Web3 space more accessible and available for Indians, especially for its 450+ million users.

Rollblock seeks to tap into this enormous market through blockchain technology. By introducing unprecedented transparency, the project aims to eliminate fraud and scams. Analysts suggest this innovation could allow Rollblock to surpass Shiba Inu and Avalanche by 2025. Rollblock Secures $9M Following Its Disruption of Traditional Gambling Rollblock’s GambleFi protocol offers over 7,000 games, sports betting, and live dealer options from upwards of 10 iGaming providers, all fully on-chain. Each game result—win or lose—is recorded on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring it remains untampered. This positions Rollblock as one of the most secure and transparent online casinos available. To further build player confidence, the platform’s smart contracts have undergone a SolidProof audit, confirming no backdoors or hidden features could compromise players. Additionally, all gaming and betting services are licensed by the Anjouan e-gaming authority. Both players and investors are responding positively to this groundbreaking approach. In December alone, Rollblock attracted over $1.75 million in bets and experienced a 600% surge in deposits and signups. The presale of RBLK is also setting records, having amassed nearly $9 million from over 40,000 early backers. Analysts are optimistic that RBLK might outperform Avalanche and Shiba Inu. This potential is largely attributed to Rollblock’s revenue-sharing model, which allocates up to 30% of its revenue to repurchase Rollblock from the open market. Of these tokens, 60% are burned while the rest are distributed as staking rewards, a strategy that has already delivered a 330% return for early investors. Can Avalanche Reach the $100 Mark? Avalanche once peaked at $65 in 2024 but later dropped below $20 before breaking out of its descending channel. This breakout drove Avalanche up to $55 in early December. However, it has since pulled back to $33, marking a 23% dip in the past week alone. Despite the downturn, Avalanche is now showing signs of a rebound. The token climbed to $41 after gaining 3.33%. Nevertheless, the 20 EMA and 50 EMA remain above the current price, indicating persistent bearish pressure for Avalanche. Resistance is anticipated at the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level of $37.65, with support potentially at $32.62 if the bearish trend continues. Falling below $30 might lead to further declines, while overcoming resistance could set the stage for a push towards $50. Shiba Inu Aims for a Top 10 Spot This Cycle Shiba Inu has climbed 7.2% in the last 24 hours. Both whale and retail investor activity have bolstered Shiba Inu’s resilience in this bullish cycle. Despite the positive outlook, technical indicators for Shiba Inu provide mixed signals. While the exponential moving average and simple moving average indicate potential upward movement, there are still bearish risks if Shiba Inu falls below critical support levels. Currently, Shiba Inu is down 74% from its all-time high. Its recovery hinges on maintaining key support zones and leveraging the growing hype within its ecosystem. Analysts remain hopeful about the memecoin’s potential for gains as it rides the wave of positive crypto sentiment and sustained investor interest. Could Rollblock Be the Next 100x Opportunity? Experts forecast that if Rollblock continues to achieve significant milestones in revenue and user growth, RBLK could emerge as the next 100x opportunity. The token has already outpaced Shiba Inu and Avalanche, delivering a 330% return in its initial presale phases. Now, Rollblock just needs to secure listings on 2-3 major exchanges to reach the $1 target. Explore the Thrilling Prospects of the Rollblock (RBLK) Presale Today!

Website Using Dogecoin Logo As Avatar,https://dailyhodl.com/2025/01/21/us-government-launches-official-d-o-g-e-website-using-dogecoin-logo-as-avatar/,"The logo of the top memecoin Dogecoin ( DOGE ) is now the face of an official US government website. The official website of the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.), a newly created department aimed at reducing unnecessary public costs, boasts the face of Kabuso , the deceased Shiba Inu who inspired Dogecoin. The D.O.G.E. will reportedly be headed by tech billionaire and Trump supporter Elon Musk, who has also been one of Dogecoin’s biggest backers. The department was originally co-chaired by Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy but Musk reportedly ousted Ramaswamy from the agency. Dogecoin has seen very little price movement off the news. DOGE is worth $0.38 at time of writing and is up 3.3% in the last 24 hours. Many crypto advocates have shown support for the proposed department. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong recently called the new department a “once in a lifetime opportunity” to “cut the size of government back to health.” Said Armstrong, “To future-proof this, we may need a constitutional amendment capping total government expenditure (at say 10%), or a way to align incentives… You’d ideally have a way to temporarily dial up burn (say in wartime), but still have the right incentives to not let spending get totally out of control longer term. An example would be a US sovereign wealth fund, where every citizen gets a share (maybe people can buy more if they want), and any budget surplus pays a dividend. Every citizen then has skin in the game. Maybe Congress gets a slightly larger stake.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The company said it plans to start allocating its excess reserve to BTC, a decision approved by its Board of Directors. The Critical Metal Corps Bitcoin Strategy According to the firm’s announcement , it may have access to a $500 million capital pool. This capital will come as part of the convertible note financing led by JBA Asset Management. The company said this funding is subject to the conditions contained in the transaction document. Breaking down the $500 million capital pool, the mining firm said it will first allocate $100 million to buy Bitcoin. The company said this first tranche was offered with a 100% warrant coverage. Critical Metal Corps said it can access the remaining $400 million at buyers’ discretion with a 50% warrant coverage. Per the funding conditions, the firm said the convertible notes are secured by the cash raised and the underlying BTC acquired. While it is yet to unveil a strategic Bitcoin purchase, it said such a move would hinge on its cash flow requirements. Ultimately, Critical Metal Corps said it may modify some of the strategy’s conditions as it deems appropriate. Diverse Companies Embracing BTC Critical Metal Corps is the first in its business line to invest heavily in Bitcoin. According to its CEO, Tony Sage, this move aligns with President Donald Trump’s strategic Bitcoin reserve plans. Companies in other industries are also adopting the premier cryptocurrency. Earlier today, Coingape reported that MicroStrategy acquired 11,000 BTC for $1.1 billion. MicroStrategy has increased its total Bitcoin stash to 461,000 units as a business intelligence and software firm. Besides Critical Metal Corps and MicroStrategy, energy management firm KULR Technologies has a robust Bitcoin portfolio. Earlier this year, KLUR bought $21 million BTC , achieving a more than 93% yield in its portfolio. Nation-State Adoption is Growing The potential of BTC is spreading beyond private and public companies to nations and states. Like the United States’ plans for a strategic Bitcoin Reserve under President Trump, countries like Hong Kong, Switzerland, and Germany are also mulling these plans. To join the trend, many American states have started introducing legislation to support BTC adoption. Per an earlier report, Massachusetts introduced a reserve bill , coming off as one of the latest states to do so. The price of BTC is recording a rebound, following the massive price slump from the start of the week.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Central District of California says Adam Iza, the founder of the crypto trading platform Zort, also known as “The Godfather,” is expected to enter a guilty plea for crimes related to extorting money from victims in Los Angeles. Iza, who has been in federal custody since September 2024, is charged with conspiracy against rights, wire fraud and tax evasion. Also agreeing to plead guilty is Iza’s alleged accomplice Eric Saavedra, an LASD deputy and a former federal task force officer. Saavedra intends to plead guilty to charges of conspiracy against rights and subscribing to a false tax return. The two are expected to officially enter guilty pleas in an LA courthouse “in the coming days.” Iza faces up to 35 years in federal prison, while Saavedra faces up to 13 years. Says Tyler Hatcher, special agent in charge for the IRS Criminal Investigation’s Los Angeles Field Office. “Mr. Iza’s and Mr. Saavedra’s relationship was little more than a thuggish partnership between a thief and a crooked cop. The public should be able to trust members of law enforcement, but Mr. Saavedra violated his oath for a payday. Mr. Iza stole from anyone he could and found a big payday by ripping off Meta so that he could afford to pay for Mr. Saavedra’s corrupt protection and assistance.” According to the press release, Iza avoided $6.78 million in federal taxes in 2021 and Saavedra received about $373,146 in unreported income in the same year. In one instance, Iza and Saavedra targeted a person Iza thought had a laptop computer with more than $100 million in cryptocurrency on it, according to federal prosecutors. “After securing the illegal warrant, Saavedra tracked down the victim and provided the victim’s address to Iza. In March 2022, Iza caused three armed individuals to try to force entry into the victim’s home to steal the laptop. The individuals fled after the victim fired a gunshot in their direction.” In other instances, “two LASD deputies held a victim at gunpoint inside Iza’s residence, after which Iza caused $25,000 to be transferred from the victim’s bank account to his own, and an October 2021 event in which Iza himself held a victim at gunpoint, causing that victim to transfer $127,000 to Iza.” Iza also admitted “to stealing more than $37 million by fraudulently gaining access to Meta Platforms Inc. business manager accounts and their associated lines of credit from 2020 to 2022.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland today, Moynihan said the sector is ready to integrate digital currencies into transaction systems. “If the regulations come into play and make this a real thing that you can actually do business with, you’re going to see the banking system come in hard on the transactional side of this,” Moynihan told CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin in an interview. Moynihan compared the use of cryptocurrencies to existing payment methods such as Visa, Mastercard, debit cards and Apple Pay, suggesting that if regulatory clarity is achieved, cryptocurrencies could become another option in the payments ecosystem. Related News: MicroStrategy Announces New Push to Buy Even More Bitcoin The banking sector’s cautious stance on retail crypto transactions contrasts with its involvement in institutional trading and asset management, particularly Bitcoin ETFs. Prominent industry leaders including JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon have previously criticized Bitcoin, labeling it a tool for criminals and scammers. Despite the skepticism surrounding cryptocurrencies, Moynihan noted Bank of America’s investment in blockchain technology. “We already have hundreds of patents on blockchain, we know how to get into this space,” he said. Moynihan avoided discussing cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin as an investment or store of value, stating that such issues were “really a separate question.” *This is not investment advice.

In a press release, the agency says pro-crypto Commissioner Hester Peirce will lead the agency-wide effort. The move is a clear contrast to the SEC’s stance under the Biden administration, which maintained that the Securities Act of 1933 is enough to protect investors in the emerging industry. Today, the SEC under acting Chairman Mark T. Uyeda has a very different message. “To date, the SEC has relied primarily on enforcement actions to regulate crypto retroactively and reactively, often adopting novel and untested legal interpretations along the way. Clarity regarding who must register, and practical solutions for those seeking to register, have been elusive. The result has been confusion about what is legal, which creates an environment hostile to innovation and conducive to fraud. The SEC can do better. The Task Force’s focus will be to help the Commission draw clear regulatory lines, provide realistic paths to registration, craft sensible disclosure frameworks, and deploy enforcement resources judiciously.” Commissioner Peirce says the agency will work with Congress and industry leaders to support the industry while protecting investors. “This undertaking will take time, patience, and much hard work. It will succeed only if the Task Force has input from a wide range of investors, industry participants, academics, and other interested parties. We look forward to working hand-in-hand with the public to foster a regulatory environment that protects investors, facilitates capital formation, fosters market integrity, and supports innovation.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

With this achievement, Bitcoin remains the market leader in the cryptocurrency innovation process, generating substantial interest from both ordinary consumers and large enterprises. Bitcoin’s price is at $108,090, slightly up by 3.58% from the previous trading day, and it reached its intraday high at $102,114. as Ripple (XRP) whales are seen buying this viral $0.14 altcoin. BTC News: Macroeconomic Winds Propel Bitcoin’s Price Forward BTC news is filled with the latest Bitcoin ATH rally, with macroeconomic factors at the helm of this push. Coupled with the latest core inflation numbers out of the US, which were lower than expected with rates hinting that the Fed will cut interest rates soon. Such monetary easing invariably creates a shift toward other assets such as cryptocurrency which is an inflation hedge. Moreover, BTC news praises the Trump administration’s policies, such as forming a national Bitcoin reserve and making the US as a hub for cryptocurrencies has also contributed positively towards the market sentiment in traditional trading. BTC news is filled with states like California and Wyoming pushing for a strategic reserve. This has provided a basis for Bitcoin’s price as an economic indicator to rally as sentiments about regulations turn optimistic. Ripple (XRP) Rides the Wave With Whales at the Helm XRP from Ripple is also hitting the shelves and is currently trading at $3.30, boasting 7.86% percent within the last one-day trading session. Recent successful legal cases and increasing optimism associated with the future increased transparency of legislation under the new government have boosted this rally. Also, in BTC news, there has been a discussion of the potential effect that an XRP ETF could have on Ripple and Bitcoin prices. As Pro-Shares plans a new XRP ETF under the new SEC, many Ripple investors are optimistic about the regulatory environment. With Bitcoin’s price surge, Ripple whales have been accumulating more XRP and at the same time investing in other promising altcoins such as DTX Exchange (DTX). Practices of this sort suggest further integration of fiat digital currencies such as XRP with novel borderline ventures that hold the potentiality to generate considerably high yields. DTX Exchange Gains Momentum as the Next Big Altcoin A new altcoin that trades at $0.14, DTX Exchange , is already enjoying tremendous popularity among investors who search for the next moonshot. It has an innovative trading model that enriches the concept of financial instruments with DeFi elements located at its core. This is why through features of extended assets support, tokenized ETFs, high-leverage options DTX aims at becoming a disruptive player on the blockchain market. Presale numbers show that the DTX token has already mobilized significant amounts of money from small and large investors, including institutions. With the seventh presale stage reaching $12 million, there are only 15% remaining tokens at a price of $0.14. It is expected that DTX Exchange will achieve a skyrocketing trend when the coin gets listed on some of the top cryptocurrency exchanges this year, making it worthy of consideration in 2025. A New Era for Diversified Crypto Investments Bitcoin (BTC), Ripple (XRP), and DTX Exchange (DTX) demonstrate significant potential, proving the constant growth of the cryptocurrency market. BTC news is optimistic as Bitcoin prices rise above $109,000; XRP’s outstanding performance contradicts regulators’ crackdown on its operations. At the same time, the DTX Exchange market is proof that the market demands more solutions that connect legacy finance to the decentralized finance world. These trends make it clear why it is crucial for investors to keep themselves updated and well-diversified so that they are in a position to take advantage of the incredibly long list of possibilities that exist in the crypto sphere.

Such monetary easing typically encourages a shift towards other assets like cryptocurrency, often viewed as a hedge against inflation. Additionally, BTC news is abuzz with praise for policies from the Trump administration, including the development of a national Bitcoin reserve and positioning the US as a crypto hub, which have bolstered market sentiment in traditional finance circles.

Ripple (XRP) Surges with Whale Investment Ripple's XRP is also gaining momentum, currently trading at $3.30 and showing a 7.86% increase in the last 24 hours. Positive outcomes in recent legal battles and growing optimism regarding more transparent legislation under the new administration have fueled this surge. Within BTC news, discussions of the potential impact of an XRP ETF on Ripple and Bitcoin prices are ongoing. Pro-Shares is planning to introduce a new XRP ETF under the new SEC, creating optimism among Ripple investors about the regulatory landscape. With Bitcoin's ascent, Ripple whales have been acquiring more XRP and also investing in promising altcoins like DTX Exchange (DTX).

Its cutting-edge trading model integrates DeFi elements into financial instruments, offering extensive asset support, tokenized ETFs, and high-leverage options, positioning DTX as a potential game-changer in the blockchain industry. Presale statistics reveal that the DTX token has already attracted substantial investment from both small and large investors, including institutions. With the seventh presale stage hitting $12 million, only 15% of tokens remain at $0.14 each.

Advancing into a New Era of Crypto Diversification Bitcoin (BTC), Ripple (XRP), and DTX Exchange (DTX) are showcasing their growth potential, underscoring the ongoing expansion of the cryptocurrency market. BTC news is optimistic as Bitcoin soars past $109,000; XRP's impressive performance defies regulatory challenges.

The news appears to have jolted World ( WLD ), formerly Worldcoin , token holders, with the cryptocurrency jumping from lows of $1.90 to an intraday high of $2.30. This rally briefly pushed WLD to the top of the rankings for biggest gainers among the top 200 coins by market cap. However, the token quickly pared some of these gains and was trading around $2.12 at the time of writing.

The MACD is slightly negative, hinting at consolidation before a possible rally. Short-term averages align closely with the current price, indicating a stable trend. Recent performance shows a solid increase, with nearly a 10% rise in a week. The 6-month surge of almost 59% hints at continued bullish momentum. Bitcoin enthusiasts anticipate significant upward movement! Solana gears up for potential price breakout Solana ‘s price shows dynamic movement within a range of $182 to $308. The current outlook is promising, with an impressive 1-week rise of over 30%. The RSI of under 50 suggests potential room for more upward movement. If Solana breaks the $365 resistance, it could accelerate toward the next target at $491. However, should the price hit the support level near $113, further drops could be expected. With its MACD slightly negative and steady stochastic values, Solana has the potential to see a notable rebound. If the market sentiment turns bullish, Solana’s price could experience a surge of over 60% from its current trajectory.

Today, January 22, 2024, the TRUMP meme coin is poised for significant upside momentum due to the formation of bullish price action on the hourly time frame. TRUMP Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to CoinPedia’s technical analysis, TRUMP appears bullish, having broken out of a small consolidation formed near a resistance level of $40. In addition to this, the meme coin has also broken out of a trend it has been facing since January 19, 2024. Source: Trading View Following this breakout, the sentiment is poised to shift from a downtrend to an uptrend. Based on recent price action and historical price momentum, if the TRUMP meme coin closes an hourly candle above the $45 level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 40% to reach the $63 level in the coming days. On the positive side, with TRUMP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 53, the meme coin indicates potential upside momentum and suggests an ideal buying opportunity. $269 Million of TRUMP Outflow and Current Price Momentum At press time, the meme coin is trading near $42 and has experienced a price surge of over 2.6% in the past 24 hours. However, during the same period, historical price momentum shows that trader and investor participation declined, leading to a 50% drop in trading volume. Despite lower participation, some investors and whales have been accumulating TRUMP meme coins, as the token is currently down by nearly 47% from its all-time high. Additionally, the tokens are backed by United States President Donald Trump. Additionally, data from the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass’s spot inflow/outflow metrics revealed that exchanges have experienced an outflow of a significant $268.8 million worth of TRUMP.

As the broader crypto market shows signs of strength, Ethereum’s underperformance has sparked fears that this cycle may not deliver the returns many expected from the leading altcoin. Sentiment in the market is shifting, with some questioning whether Ethereum can reclaim its former dominance amid fierce competition from emerging projects. Related Reading: Dogecoin Trades Within Multi-Year Ascending Channel – Expert Sets $15 Price Target However, a closer look at key metrics offers a more optimistic perspective. According to the MVRV Pricing Bands chart, Ethereum is still far from its previous all-time high (ATH). This metric, which evaluates the market value relative to realized value, suggests that ETH has significant room to grow in the coming months. While the current price action may seem discouraging to some, historical data indicates that Ethereum often lags in the early stages of a bull market before catching up with explosive moves. For long-term investors, this could represent an opportunity rather than a setback, as Ethereum’s fundamentals remain strong and its ecosystem continues to expand. As the market anticipates the next phase of growth, all eyes are on Ethereum to see if it can reclaim its leadership role and deliver on its potential. Ethereum Preparing To Surprise The Market Ethereum has faced significant challenges over the past month, remaining in a downtrend since mid-December. The cryptocurrency has dropped as much as 29% in less than 30 days, testing the patience of investors as the broader market shows strength while ETH struggles to gain momentum. Trading below key supply levels, Ethereum’s performance has raised concerns about its ability to keep up with the overall crypto rally. Despite the bleak sentiment, some analysts see Ethereum’s current situation as an opportunity rather than a setback. Top analyst Carl Runefelt recently shared insights on X, pointing to the MVRV Pricing Bands chart as a key indicator of Ethereum’s potential. According to Runefelt, ETH is far from its all-time high (ATH), suggesting significant room for growth. He confidently stated that a $7,000 price target for Ethereum is only a matter of time, given its long-term fundamentals and historical market cycles. Runefelt also highlighted Ethereum’s readiness to change the bearish sentiment surrounding it. As the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Ethereum’s extensive ecosystem and institutional adoption remain strong drivers for future growth. Related Reading: Solana Turns Key Level Into Support – Analyst Expects ‘Violent Moves Before Next Leg Up’ For investors with a long-term outlook, Ethereum’s current underperformance could represent a strategic entry point. With sentiment poised to shift and key metrics signaling room for growth, ETH has the potential to recover and reclaim its position as a market leader. ETH Price Testing Key Demand Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $3,302 following days of heightened volatility and sustained selling pressure. Despite the challenging market conditions, ETH has demonstrated resilience by holding above a key demand zone near the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $3,127. This critical level has acted as a strong support, signaling that buyers remain active even amid market uncertainty. For Ethereum to reclaim bullish momentum, the price needs to break above the $3,520 resistance level with conviction. This move would not only reinforce confidence among investors but also pave the way for further upside. Holding above $3,520 is essential for confirming a shift in market sentiment and establishing a foundation for a sustained rally. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reclaims Crucial Liquidity Level – No Resistance Left Below ATH As ETH navigates these pivotal levels, traders are closely monitoring its ability to maintain support and generate upward momentum. A successful push above $3,520 could trigger increased buying activity, potentially setting the stage for Ethereum to resume its uptrend. However, failure to clear this resistance could lead to continued consolidation, delaying a potential recovery. For now, all eyes remain on Ethereum as it tests key technical levels in a bid to regain its position as a top-performing asset in the crypto market.

This forward-thinking strategy reaffirms Aave’s position as a pivotal figure in tackling major DeFi challenges. With these upgrades on track for completion by mid-2025, Aave’s price is seeing significant momentum. Enhancing its growth narrative, Aave has evolved into Avara following its rebrand and the acquisition of the Family crypto wallet, broadening its influence in the Web3 ecosystem.

As Aave continues to optimize its operations on platforms like Polygon, it showcases a proactive stance in securely scaling throughout 2025.

According to the announcement, this will take effect from February 28, 2025. His resignation comes at a tough time for the cryptocurrency mining firm, which is facing large financial losses and pressure to become profitable. Argo Choose CFO to Temporarily Serve as CEO The company aimed to take advantage of the increasing demand for blockchain and crypto-mining solutions under Thomas’s leadership. However, recent reports show that the company did not meet the expected returns, especially in the third quarter of 2024. Argo Blockchain reported a net loss of $6.3 million in its Q3 financial report, raising concerns about its long-term future. The company faced challenges from fluctuating cryptocurrency prices, high operating costs, and growing competition in the mining sector. These difficulties have pushed Argo Blockchain to look for ways to stabilize and become profitable again. With Thomas leaving, Jim MacCallum, the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), will temporarily take over as CEO. Intriguingly, MacCallum has been with the company since its early days and has a lot of experience in handling finances and operations. In his new role, he will manage the day-to-day operations while the company looks for a permanent CEO. Argo Blockchain Faced Several Lawsuits In 2023, a joint class action lawsuit was filed against Argo Blockchain by its investors who purchased the Company’s American Depository Shares (ADSs). The embattled cryptocurrency mining platform was accused of making false and misleading statements during its initial public offering (IPO). Instead of listing the risks involved in investing in its venture, the crypto miner avoided information that could help investors make decisions. At that time, Argo Blockchain was at risk of spiking electricity bills, network difficulties, etc, and all this information was omitted during the IPO. Ultimately, Argo was not as sustainable as it was portrayed during that time . Argo and the Emphasis on Expansion Argo blockchain comes off as one of the dominant Bitcoin mining firms in the United Kingdom. However, the company has pushed for markets in new jurisdictions. The company built a mining facility in West Texas, capturing the North American market. Meanwhile, the company’s expansion drives extend beyond the mining operations and into the firm’s investor base. Argo Blockchain conducted a secondary listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, trading under the ‘ARBK’ ticker symbol.

Expert Predict Its Not ADA,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/ath-countdown-which-altcoin-will-follow-xrp-to-hit-new-highs-in-january-expert-predict-its-not-ada,"With 2025 starting to show its first major bull run for cryptos, investors are looking for high-return options with the highest returns. Major names like Cardano (ADA) and Ripple (XRP) are emerging as top investment options. XRP’s price was troubled during the recent consolidation phase as investors waited for further clarity over its regulatory issues with the SEC. Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA) has also suffered from negative news around its platform and internal conflict all through December, which affected its price performance. Now as the market surge has started mid-January, XRP price has shot up into double-digit growth, outperforming Cardano (ADA) by over double. This is proving experts right that the next Ripple in crypto is going to be the DTX Exchange (DTX) with its technical strengths and user-oriented product offering. It has shown an impressive presale performance, drawing comparisons with XRP’s price gains. XRP Price Gains 45% In Weekly Charts XRP price is rallying, and investors are going wild as the price surge continues and a new all-time high price is reached after almost seven years. Ripple has shot up in value from around $2.29 last week to over $3.33 in the past week alone. In other words, an increase of over 45% in just a few days. Source: CoinMarketCap Crypto analysts are back to new predictions as their old ones are proven right,. They’ve set the new benchmark for XRP price at $5, and predict that the next big thing in crypto after Ripple is going to be DTX Exchange. Cardano (ADA) Price Gains 6% In Daily Trading Cardano (ADA) and Ripple have both been in the news post-election as the Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson shared news and the administration’s perspective on crypto. However, despite its strong ecosystem, high growth potential, and strong utilities Cardano (ADA) has not been able to match the upside shown by XRP price so far. Source: CoinMarketCap The Cardano (ADA) price rose 20% in weekly charts, compared to the XRP price’s phenomenal 45% gains. In daily charts, ADA rose 4% while the XRP price gain was 19%. This is why most market experts are citing DTX Exchange as the next viral sensation once it launches and not Cardano. DTX Exchange: Robo-Trading With 1000x Leverage DTX Exchange is a novel trading platform that is set to change the crypto trading industry with its top-class features. It runs on the proprietary layer-1 VulcanX blockchain. This chain delivers rapid processing of 200,000 Transactions Per Second (TPS) and ensures that all trades are completed in 0.04 milliseconds. Another outstanding feature that gives DTX Exchange an edge over Cardano (ADA) and Ripple is its multi-asset support. Traders can pick assets ranging from equities to commodities and cryptocurrencies. This diversity makes DTX a haven for multi-asset traders. The exchange also offers up to 1,000X leverage to traders. This high leverage, combined with a range of assets, makes trading profitable, especially when copy trading or using robo-traders. DTX Exchange (DTX) also has a non-custodial wallet that increases its security and reliability. With this wallet, users can use their funds while keeping them protected from cyber attacks. Conclusion There is no doubt that both Cardano (ADA) and Ripple have been among the most prominent players in crypto for years. But seeing the transformative features and possible ETF trading features, DTX Exchange can take over the market soon. That’s why the DTX presale is perfectly timed for traders who are interested in getting in early on this game-changing platform. The recent surge in investor interest in DTX can be gauged by the $11.5 million already raised by the token in the presale rounds. Currently, it is priced at just $0.14 in the seventh round and will increase to $0.16 when the next round starts.

Big names like Cardano (ADA) and Ripple (XRP) are emerging as prime choices for investment. XRP's price faced challenges during the recent consolidation phase while investors awaited more clarity on its regulatory issues with the SEC. At the same time, Cardano (ADA) was hit with negative news about its platform and internal disputes throughout December, impacting its price performance. Now, as the market rally gains momentum in mid-January, XRP's price has soared with double-digit growth, outpacing Cardano (ADA) by more than twice. Experts are backing their predictions that the next big player in crypto could be DTX Exchange (DTX) due to its technical prowess and user-focused offerings. Its impressive presale performance has drawn parallels with XRP’s price surge. XRP Sees a 45% Increase in Weekly Charts XRP's value is on the rise, exciting investors as it continues to climb and reaches a new all-time high for the first time in nearly seven years. Ripple's price shot up from about $2.29 last week to over $3.33 in just a week, marking a more than 45% increase in a matter of days. Source: CoinMarketCap Crypto analysts are revisiting their forecasts as past predictions come true. They've set a new target for XRP at $5, and forecast that DTX Exchange could be the next major player following Ripple. Cardano (ADA) Sees 6% Increase in Daily Trading Both Cardano (ADA) and Ripple have been in the spotlight following the election, with Cardano’s founder Charles Hoskinson discussing news and the administration’s stance on crypto. However, despite its robust ecosystem, significant growth potential, and strong utilities, Cardano (ADA) has yet to match the upward momentum demonstrated by XRP. Source: CoinMarketCap In the weekly charts, Cardano (ADA) saw a 20% rise, which pales in comparison to XRP’s impressive 45% increase. On the daily charts, ADA experienced a 4% gain, while XRP climbed 19%. This has led many market experts to suggest that DTX Exchange, not Cardano, will be the next big hit once it launches. DTX Exchange: Robo-Trading with Massive Leverage DTX Exchange is set to revolutionize the crypto trading landscape with its premium features. Built on the proprietary layer-1 VulcanX blockchain, it offers rapid processing of 200,000 Transactions Per Second (TPS), completing trades in just 0.04 milliseconds. A standout feature of DTX Exchange is its support for multiple assets, distinguishing it from Cardano (ADA) and Ripple. Traders can choose from a variety of assets, including equities, commodities, and cryptocurrencies, making it an ideal platform for multi-asset traders. The exchange also offers up to 1,000X leverage, enhancing trading profitability, especially when using strategies like copy trading or robo-traders. DTX Exchange (DTX) also features a non-custodial wallet, bolstering its security and reliability, allowing users to access their funds securely and protect them from cyber threats. Conclusion While Cardano (ADA) and Ripple have long been influential players in the crypto world, the innovative features and potential ETF trading options offered by DTX Exchange might soon capture the market. The DTX presale presents a timely opportunity for traders eager to engage with this groundbreaking platform early on. Investor interest in DTX is evident from the $11.5 million already secured during its presale rounds.

Events included the Crypto Ball, a dinner hosted by the Vice President, and gatherings at the Capitol. Sharing his enthusiasm on social media, Garlinghouse remarked on the growing momentum for leveraging blockchain technology for economic innovation in the United States and globally. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse Advocates for Blockchain In a recent post shared on X , Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse reflected on his participation in multiple inauguration events. He attended the Crypto Ball, a Vice President-hosted dinner, and a Capitol gathering, emphasizing his optimism about the role of blockchain in driving economic growth. Garlinghouse shared a picture with Vice President JD Vance, celebrating the collaborative efforts of the blockchain and political sectors during the festivities. His presence at these high-profile events showcased Ripple’s continued commitment to advancing blockchain adoption in the United States. Ripple CEO comments come days after the XRP company CLO Stuart Alderoty celebrated Gary Gensler’s departure as SEC Chair, marking a shift in regulatory enforcement. Ripple CLO mocked Gensler’s exit, suggesting his relevance to the crypto industry would fade. Growing Support for Blockchain Innovation During his social media post, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse stressed the potential of blockchain technology to address global challenges. He highlighted its rising acceptance in the U.S., signaling a new era of economic innovation. Brad stated, “There’s palpable excitement for all the good that’s possible leveraging crypto and blockchain in the US and globally.” More so, Ripple CEO remarked that these discussions pave the way for an inclusive financial ecosystem, aligning with Ripple’s vision for cross-border payments. XRP Lawsuit Status Meanwhile, Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) remains a key topic. The SEC continues to appeal the 2023 ruling that XRP sales to retail investors did not constitute securities. However, with Gary Gensler out as SEC Chair and a new administration taking charge, legal experts believe the case may be resolved. Reports suggest that the current SEC leadership could choose to drop the appeal, given the court’s earlier ruling favoring Ripple. This development could bring clarity to XRP’s regulatory status and support broader crypto adoption. Moreover, most recently, Securities Lawyer Marc Fagel has speculated that the Ripple vs SEC case may see a delay extending up to 10 months. He suggested that the outcome depends on decisions from the new SEC Chair, Paul Atkins, who could settle the case sooner if he drops the ongoing appeal. Despite the legal challenges, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s active participation in inauguration events signals confidence in blockchain.

Data on the decentralized betting platform Polymarket shows Ulbricht has a 93% chance of leaving prison within the next few weeks. How Ulbricht Ended Up in Jail The surge in the odds of Trump pardoning Ulbricht came shortly after the American Billionaire Elon Musk commented on an X post about placing the Silk Road founder’s pardon at the top of the president’s executive order stack. “Ross will be freed too,” Musk stated, implying that Ulbricht would likely be pardoned sooner than later. In 2013, U.S. authorities arrested Ulbricht on several charges, including running Silk Road, which facilitated sex trafficking and the sale of illegal drugs using bitcoin (BTC), money laundering, drug trafficking, and computer hacking. Activities on Silk Road led to the platform processing more than $1 billion in transactions. After a two-year legal battle, a U.S. federal court sentenced Ulbricht to two life terms plus 40 years without the possibility of parole. The sentencing sparked controversy in the crypto industry, with many arguing that it was excessively harsh, while others insist that the activities on Silk Road merit the level of punishment given to Ulbricht. As of 2025, Ulbricht had spent more than a decade in prison, with authorities seizing over $1 billion in BTC from Silk Road’s treasury. The crypto community and over 250 organizations have advocated for Ulbricht’s release. During his campaign, President Donald Trump also promised to pardon the Silk Road founder once he assumed office. Trump’s Promises About a month to the end of his former tenure as the U.S. president, Trump reportedly considered pardoning Ulbricht. This was in 2020, and the Silk Road creator had spent about seven years behind bars. Unfortunately, Trump skipped Ulbricht while issuing pardons to other convicts, including his former campaign advisor Steve Bannon and ex-Ripple board member Ken Kurson. Since the beginning of 2024, Trump has shown support for Ulbricht, making several vows to save the convict and commute his sentence as soon as he takes office. With the president being inaugurated less than 24 hours before this report, how quickly Ulbricht will be pardoned remains to be seen.
