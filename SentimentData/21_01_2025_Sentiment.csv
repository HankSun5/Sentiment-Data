The crypto has seen a 9.14% rise over the past week and a remarkable 52.42% increase over the past 6 months. Current movements suggest BTC could climb further, potentially testing the resistance level at $116,283. With a Relative Strength Index at 58.67, Bitcoin is on the verge of entering an overbought zone, indicating continued interest from buyers. The 10-day Simple Moving Average shows more strength than the 100-day average, reinforcing this bullish outlook. Should the momentum continue, Bitcoin might even aim for the next resistance at $133,437, a potential upside of over 20%.

Donald Trump’s DOGE Under Scrutiny From Law firm According to a January 20 report from The Washington Post , National Security Counselors has filed a lawsuit based upon accusations that DOGE violates federal transparency requirements. A lawsuit was filed against Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy’s new nongovernmental entity as soon as Donald Trump was officially president. https://t.co/1ZQnybii3H — The Washington Post (@washingtonpost) January 20, 2025 Documents obtained by The Washington Post reveal that the so-called “public interest law firm” alleges that DOGE fails to follow long-standing executive branch hiring and disclosure practices. National Security Counselors claim that DOGE fits the categorization of a federal advisory committee, an entity that has specific standards of governance including filing a charter of governance which DOGE has allegedly yet to do. Despite these allegations, Trump remains confident in the project and its leadership. Trump announced the project in November 2024. He tapped both Musk and former Republican Party candidate Vivek Ramaswamy to lead the initiative, which focuses heavily on reducing governmental “red tape” and excessive spending. You might also like Donald Trump Taps Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy to Oversee Department of Government Efficiency “Together, these two wonderful Americans will pave the way for my Administration to dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal agencies,” Trump said in part in a November 2024 statement. However, reports emerged over the weekend that Ramaswamy may look to depart the newfound advisory committee in light of tensions within DOGE itself, though he has yet to publicly comment on the allegations. Ramaswamy is reportedly planning to announce his campaign for Ohio governor as soon as the end of the month. Elon Musk Continues DOGE Work Amid Ramaswamy Rift Reports Ramaswamy’s DOGE departure and the panel’s lawsuit come at a critical point for Trump, who has already invoked several executive orders upon taking office, one of which designated digital assets as a “national priority.” President Trump, who played a role in launching his family’s crypto platform World Liberty Financial last year, has long promised to implement crypto-friendly regulations upon his return to the White House. “We will have regulations,” Trump stated at the Bitcoin 2024 Conference this past summer, adding, “but from now on, the rules will be written by the people who love your industry, not hate your industry. Trump has also tapped former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins to lead the federal regulator following years of stringent crypto enforcement by now-resigned SEC chair Gary Gensler. With Trump now officially back in the White House, it seems as though a crypto regulatory framework is closer to happening than ever before.

Table of Contents The Dogecoin success story WallitIQ: The Ethereum token to transform crypto investments Conclusion During the 2021 bull run, a famous analyst turned a strategic Dogecoin (DOGE) investment into a $30 million profit, earning worldwide acclaim. This crypto visionary has identified a new opportunity in WallitIQ (WLTQ), suggesting the Ethereum token poised for a 34,550% rally with its $0.0420 presale. The Dogecoin success story Dogecoin started as a meme token but soon became a market phenomenon. In 2021, DOGE skyrocketed from under $0.01 to its all-time high of $0.74, influenced by community enthusiasm and endorsements from high-profile figures like Elon Musk. Currently trading at $0.3591, the Dogecoin price shows potential for a rebound, with analysts predicting a climb to $1. However, the days of astronomical returns seem gone. Recognizing this, the famous analyst has shifted focus to WallitIQ, which promises greater upside. You might also like: Crypto expert advises buying WallitIQ at $0.04 before it’s too late WallitIQ: The Ethereum token to transform crypto investments WallitIQ has succeeded from its first presale stage to the current phase. Starting at $0.0171, the token’s price has surged to $0.0420, reflecting a 71.43% increase, with the price set to jump to $0.0620 in the fourth stage. With over $7 million generated in revenue and $5 million more expected to be raised in its current presale stage, the Ethereum token has become a favorite among investors. One of the key drivers behind WallitIQ’s success is its recently announced MVP build of a crypto wallet management mobile app. Designed to simplify wallet and transaction management, the app offers wallet management tools for ETH and USDT wallets. It also generates QR codes for easy payment receipt so users can test the Scan and Pay QR feature. The platform’s crypto wallet management mobile app is integrated with CoinGecko’s API. The API captures all price data including the opening, closing, highest, and lowest prices of all crypto tickers. Thus, users will always have an all-around view of their assets’ market performance. The app also features candlestick charts for all tickers. Users can view these by tapping on any ticker, and the chart will pop up. With interactive controls and an adjustable timeframe, users and traders can apply data-driven strategies for success. In addition to its SolidProof audit , these features make WallitIQ a potential solution for modern crypto investors, driving confidence. Experts predict WLTQ’s price could climb to $12 post-launch, representing a 34,550% increase. As such, the WallitIQ presale offers an opportunity to potentially secure gains comparable to Dogecoin’s. Conclusion The story of the famous analyst turning Dogecoin into a $30 million success is a testament to the power of early investments in promising projects. With a 34,550% rally predicted for WallitIQ, this Ethereum token could represent the next chapter in crypto success stories.

Per Hanguk Kyungjae , the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), has processed the application of the cryptoasset brokerage platform company Happy Block. VASP License Approval: Opening the Door to Corporate BTC Buying? The approval comes hot on the heels of the FIU’s decision to grant a VASP license to another brokerage – named Waybridge – in late December last year. A South Korean crypto exchange customer trades Bitcoin. (Source: YTN Science Today/YouTube/Screenshot) The FIU operates under the auspices of the country’s top regulator, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) . The unit is the only body in the country with the power to grant companies virtual asset service provider (VASP) licenses. Until the past few weeks, only a handful of crypto exchanges have managed to secure VASP permits. Since Seoul started policing the crypto industry in earnest in 2018, all crypto brokerages have had to shut up shop. However, the FSC appears ready to soften its famously hardline stance on crypto regulation in 2025. The investigators appear to have hit a wall in questioning President Yoon Suk Yeol. https://t.co/j31H8HQEZu #YoonSukYeol #SouhtKorea #Investigation — The Korea Herald 코리아헤럴드 (@TheKoreaHerald) January 20, 2025 Regulator Speaks of ‘Gradual’ Reform The FSC has refused to commit itself to crypto deregulation. But it has suggested it could “review” its policy on allowing companies to buy BTC and other cryptoassets with their balance sheets. The Happy Block approval appears to be a step in this direction. The firm is “a digital assets brokerage company” that launched in May 2022. It calls itself a “digital securities company” and has reportedly been “preparing virtual asset brokerage services for corporations.” Its high-profile backers include SK Securities, and it also has partnership deals with overseas players like Fireblocks and Kaico. The firm is also developing a platform for “institutional investors,” with integrated management, custody, and personal crypto wallet services. It was just minutes after a South Korean court issued a fresh warrant to detain President Yoon Suk Yeol when a group of his supporters turned violent and started storming the courthouse https://t.co/QggOVHyvM7 — Bloomberg Politics (@bpolitics) January 20, 2025 Companies Keen on Crypto The company also plans to provide over-the-counter (OTC) brokerage services for crypto orders and “bulk transactions for institutions.” A wide range of South Korean companies are thought to be keen to buy BTC and other tokens. However, they are currently unable to do so, as FSC guidelines to banks effectively prohibit financial institutions from letting corporate customers open crypto exchange-linked accounts. This is because financial regulators have ruled that virtual assets “are not financial investment products under the terms of the Capital Market Act.” However, the same media outlet wrote that the FSC has “been moving to ease regulations related to virtual assets, albeit slowly, this year.” The FSC has stated that it will be “gradual” with the process. Industry insiders think that public bodies will first be granted the right to sell crypto donations before other firms get the green light. An unnamed South Korean financial investment industry insider told the media outlet: “Currently, even in the US, traditional securities firms do not handle receiving orders for cryptoassets managed by asset management companies.” Financial group chiefs stress Korea's robust fundamentals to offshore investors https://t.co/9yHPJEybTP — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) January 19, 2025 Bitcoin ETF Approval Next? The same insider added that the move could also eventually see the FSC open the door to Bitcoin spot ETF approval. The source said: “If domestic virtual asset ETFs are introduced, there will naturally be a need for bodies who can execute institutional investor orders. Crypto brokerage companies have been preparing for that very role. I believe the FSC approved the [VASP application] because it deemed it necessary [for Bitcoin ETF approval].” However, the FSC has made cagey statements on calls to approve Bitcoin spot ETFs. Earlier this year, the FSC Director Kwon Dae-young said that Bitcoin ETF approval would be going “a step too far.” Gangnam, in Seoul, South Korea. The district is home to most of the nation’s biggest crypto companies. (Source: Gdog (CC BY-SA 3.0]) But Kwon conceded that the government was “fully aware of the changes [in crypto regulation] that are taking place globally.” Meanwhile, Happy Block CEO Kim Gyu-yoon said that the firm was “planning to pursue business in line with the policy direction of financial regulators.” Kim promised to “respond to major issues such as investor protection , anti-money laundering, and taxation issues.” The CEO also mentioned the need to “carry out business in accordance” with regulators’ “schedule for introducing spot ETFs.” The company’s wait for VASP approval has been a long one. Around a year and five months have passed since Happy Block first submitted its application to the FIU.

At the time of writing, the ETH/BTC trading pair stands at 0.031, marking a four-year low for the ratio. ETH/BTC Continues To Decline As Trump Focuses On Bitcoin Over the past year, Bitcoin has appreciated by an impressive 158%, surging from approximately $41,000 on January 21, 2024, to $107,608 at the time of writing. The cryptocurrency has consistently reached new all-time highs (ATH) throughout the year. In contrast, Ethereum has delivered a modest return of approximately 35% over the same period and remains 32% below its November 2021 ATH of $4,878. Related Reading: Will Ethereum Bounce Back? Crypto Analysts Discuss Potential Price Recovery According to the weekly chart below from TradingView, the ETH/BTC trading pair — also referred to as the ETH/BTC ratio within the crypto industry — has reached a fresh four-year low. This decline has raised concerns about the likelihood of an Ethereum-led altcoin season. Currently trading at 0.031, the ETH/BTC ratio has erased all gains accumulated since March 2021. The pair peaked at 0.087 in December 2021, during the height of that year’s altcoin season. Since then, however, Ethereum, the second-largest digital asset by market capitalization, has experienced a steady decline against Bitcoin. In May 2024, the ratio fell below 0.054, a critical support level that had previously held firm in June 2022. Several factors have contributed to Ethereum’s underperformance, including Trump’s perceived preference for Bitcoin and the rising competition from rival smart-contract platforms like Solana (SOL). Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum has struggled with adoption. Corporations worldwide are increasingly incorporating Bitcoin into their balance sheets, reinforcing BTC’s status as a premier digital asset. Additionally, speculation about the creation of a US strategic Bitcoin reserve has further bolstered the narrative around Bitcoin’s limited supply, driving its price higher. Conversely, Ethereum’s relatively high issuance rate has cast doubt on its “ultrasound money” narrative. Ethereum’s 2024 performance has also eroded confidence among some of its largest holders. Notably, an ETH whale recently sold 10,070 ETH at a $1 million loss, signaling waning investor trust. Will 2025 Change Ethereum’s Fortunes? While 2024 was a challenging year for Ethereum in terms of price performance, crypto analysts remain optimistic about the asset’s prospects in 2025. For example, a report by Steno Research predicts that Ethereum could surge to as high as $8,000 this year. Related Reading: Ethereum Poised For A Bullish Q1 2025? Here’s What Experts Say Similarly, crypto analyst Daan forecasts that the ETH/BTC trading pair could rise above 0.04 during Q1 2025. In December 2024, Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experienced renewed interest from institutional investors, fueling hopes for significant capital inflows into the smart-contract platform. That said, Ethereum must first overcome strong resistance at the $4,000 price level. At press time, ETH trades at $3,368, down 1.3% in the past 24 hours.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Crypto experts select Rollblock as the next potential altcoin star after Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Table of Contents Meme coin favorites still going strong Rollblock steals the show Conclusion Many crypto fans have watched the rise of Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) with great excitement over the past few years. Both tokens grabbed headlines by turning simple memes into global phenomena, driving their market caps to impressive heights. Today, a fresh contender named Rollblock (RBLK) is stepping into the spotlight, drawing attention as a possible multi-billion dollar gem. Enthusiasts searching for the best crypto presales are starting to notice how Rollblock could fuse real online gaming with rewarding tokenomics. Some analysts highlight the project’s focus on transparency and weekly revenue sharing, seeing it as a sign that Rollblock could transform digital gambling. Fans of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu remain curious about whether this newcomer can truly match — or even exceed — meme coin hype. It helps that RBLK stands on solid fundamentals, unlike coins that rely only on internet buzz. Meme coin favorites still going strong Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have both claimed major market positions. With DOGE having a market cap around $53 billion and SHIB at $12 billion, these playful cryptos have proven to be more than a fad. Interestingly, analysts often check the Dogecoin price for signs of renewed surges. Shiba Inu also draws constant attention as the next loved meme coin. However, meme coins face challenges in proving their real-world usefulness. While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu remain symbols of community power, some investors are shifting toward tokens with clear benefits. This movement could give Rollblock and RBLK the opening they need to thrive.

By offering up to 30% of its casino profits to RBLK holders through regular buybacks and burns, Rollblock will create a deflationary effect that can boost token value. Additionally, stakers can earn extra rewards simply by holding their coins. Rollblock is also forging a clear path with licensing, security audits, and advanced features like AI-based betting tools. The focus on fairness and real earnings could make Rollblock a top choice for those who want more than quick speculative profits. With a steady plan to lock team tokens for 24 months, the developers show they are in it for the long haul. Rollblock aims to appeal to everyday users who like online gaming but crave something that offers lasting value. Conclusion In a market that values both fun and utility, Rollblock has a strong chance to capture attention and deliver real results. Thanks to its detailed strategy that rewards token holders, protects user funds, and releases exciting gaming features, RBLK might become the next multi-billion dollar star.

The trader, identified by the Solana address 4zo6…zHF2, exchanged 800,000 USD Coin (USDC) on Jan. 20 and converted it into 16.45 million USDC in just 12 hours, achieving nearly 2000% gains. Another trader reportedly turned $560,000 into $11.5 million by investing in MELANIA, while a third pocketed $47.5 million in profits. These massive gains came as MELANIA’s price soared by 25,600% within 12 hours of its launch across various crypto exchanges. Melania Trump’s verified X account announced the token, which quickly gained traction with around 500,000 holders, according to DEX Screener. The token has also become the 10th most traded cryptocurrency by volume. MELANIA’s meteoric rise coincided with the buzz surrounding Donald Trump’s second-term inauguration and the debut of his own memecoin, Official TRUMP ($TRUMP). The TRUMP token, released shortly before MELANIA, climbed into the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap, reaching a fully diluted value of approximately $50 billion. Concerns About MELANIA’s Transparency Despite its rapid success, MELANIA has faced criticism regarding its token distribution and project transparency. Blockchain analytics platform Bubblemaps revealed that nearly 90% of MELANIA’s supply is controlled by a single wallet, raising doubts about the fairness of its distribution. Additionally, the token’s website, launched a day before its debut, has been criticized for weak cybersecurity and subpar development. Coinbase executive Conor Grogan commented that MELANIA appeared less professionally managed than the TRUMP token, likening it to a project run by “college kids.” While doubts remain about MELANIA’s transparency and execution, its unprecedented gains have fueled excitement and speculation in the crypto space.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,USDC|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-20 23:52:00

Meanwhile, the SUI coin price continues to show volatility, as cryptocurrency analysts monitor its potential to rebound. At BlockDAG, the recruitment of Marius Bock, previously a major figure at Cardano, introduces new leadership and strategic insights to the initiative. BlockDAG (BDAG) has achieved notable progress, and with Bock’s deep experience, it is well-positioned for further achievements. The BDAG coin, now in its presale phase with over $182 million collected, is currently among the top trending crypto assets. Trump’s Policy Expectations Propel Toncoin’s Expansion in the U.S. Market The TON Foundation, linked with Telegram Messenger LLP, is actively pursuing Toncoin (TON) expansion in the United States, encouraged by projected favorable regulatory changes under the new Trump leadership. The foundation’s recent onboarding of Manuel Stotz, an experienced founder of Kingsway Capital Partners Ltd., signifies a major move in strengthening its position in the U.S. As the foundation intensifies its efforts, Toncoin (TON) has captured significant market attention, with its value reflecting growing interest. This strategy highlights the foundation’s readiness to capitalize on expected regulatory developments. Varied Indicators for SUI Coin Price This Week The SUI coin price has experienced fluctuating performance this week, mirroring both prospects and obstacles in the current marketplace. After climbing 10% to $4.76 following Bitcoin’s support at $92,000, the SUI coin price then fell by 4.3%, underscoring its dependency on Bitcoin’s trends. Technical analysts emphasize the significance of the Yearly Open as a pivotal support and the possibilities for further stabilization near Fibonacci retracement levels. With Bitcoin challenging major resistance points, the SUI coin price is under scrutiny for potential upward movements, as the market anticipates a broader bullish trend from leading digital currencies. BlockDAG Accelerates with New Leadership from Former Cardano Executive Marius Bock has joined BlockDAG as Lead Project Manager, bringing extensive expertise from over 25 years in blockchain and fintech. His leadership at Cardano, where he directed the development of cryptocurrency wallet technologies, highlights his proficiency in managing advanced projects. During his tenure at Visa, he led mobile money initiatives across various nations, proving his ability to oversee expansive projects successfully. These experiences demonstrate his skill in delivering significant outcomes within diverse industries and technologies. With Marius at the helm, BlockDAG is poised to fully utilize its capabilities. His experience in leading large teams and implementing scalable projects is set to enhance the network’s structure, paving the way for a robust ecosystem conducive to decentralized applications. Marius’s efforts to upgrade the network’s functions will ensure BlockDAG remains a preferred platform for developers and users alike, promoting wider acceptance and steady growth. His strategic leadership is anticipated to significantly boost the reliability and market competitiveness of the BlockDAG ecosystem. BlockDAG has already marked significant achievements, with its BDAG coin presale garnering over $182 million and selling 17.9 billion coins, experiencing a remarkable price increase of 2380%, from $0.001 to $0.0248 across 27 batches. As the mainnet launch draws near later this year, the chance to buy BDAG at presale prices is diminishing quickly. As BlockDAG continues to reach new heights, it solidifies its status as a top trending crypto, drawing increasing interest from traders keen on joining its swift growth. Market Developments to Watch As Toncoin’s (TON) expansion progresses in the U.S., the scenario looks promising due to anticipated supportive regulations with the Trump administration. The SUI coin price also seems promising, attracting market attention due to its potential for recovery. Yet, the spotlight is on BlockDAG, particularly with Marius Bock’s impactful entry. His leadership, combined with the team’s strategic plans, propels BlockDAG towards further growth. Now in the 27th batch of a highly successful presale, the BDAG coin has raised over $182 million, showing immense potential for growth. With a solid groundwork laid, it has become a top trending crypto , making this an opportune moment to engage before its value soars.

Cardano Enhances Governance & Solana Rolls Out a Memecoin,https://thecoinrise.com/investors-rave-over-web3bay-blockchain-transforms-e-commerce-cardano-enhances-governance-solana-rolls-out-a-memecoin/,"The cryptocurrency landscape is busy as Cardano rolls out its latest governance features and Solana’s meme coin, TRUMP, amplifies its market presence. Meanwhile, Web3Bay (3BAY) has captured the imagination and excitement of investors by uniquely merging blockchain technology with e-commerce. This integration promises to revolutionize the shopping experience, offering secure, transparent transactions and significant perks for token holders. Priced attractively at just $0.0045626 in its ongoing fourth presale stage, Web3Bay has already raised $830,000 and sold 220 million tokens, signaling strong market confidence and setting up early investors for an impressive potential ROI of 6,430%. Cardano Advances: Enhancing Security & Engagement Cardano has seen noteworthy price volatility, reaching highs of $1.16 and lows of $1.054, with a recent trading price of $1.061. The implementation of the Chang hard fork marks a significant milestone in Cardano’s development towards decentralized governance, enhancing user engagement in decision-making processes. These enhancements are designed to solidify Cardano’s position in the crypto market by promoting a more democratic governance model and potentially fostering new collaborations and partnerships. This focus on decentralized governance is expected to enhance the platform’s resilience against security threats and increase its appeal to a broader base of developers. Additionally, Cardano’s commitment to regular updates and community involvement positions it as a leader in sustainable and scalable blockchain solutions. Solana’s Market Surge: The Impact of TRUMP Memecoin Solana’s recent trading figures are impressive, with a current price of $240.47, having achieved highs of $243.26 and lows of $216.47. The launch of the TRUMP meme coin has not only increased Solana’s market cap to nearly $9 billion but also significantly enhanced its visibility in the crypto space. This surge in attention could be further bolstered by favorable regulatory developments expected with the new pro-crypto administration, potentially leading to the approval of cryptocurrency ETFs that could attract more institutional investors to Solana. The platform’s high throughput and low transaction costs make it an ideal choice for developers looking to build scalable applications, contributing to its rapid growth in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. As Solana continues to develop and integrate new features, it is poised to become a major player in the blockchain ecosystem, competing directly with more established platforms. Secure, Scalable, & Affordable: Web3Bay’s Tech Sets New Standards During the dynamic shifts in the cryptocurrency sector, Web3Bay stands out by effectively merging blockchain technology with e-commerce. This strategic integration not only streamlines transactions but also fortifies security, setting a new benchmark for online retail. The platform’s advanced design supports scalable growth through the use of smart contracts and decentralized protocols, enhancing transactional efficiency and reliability. Web3Bay’s current presale, now in its fourth stage, has successfully raised $830,000 and sold 220 million tokens, demonstrating robust investor confidence and market potential. Priced at just $0.0045626 per token, Web3Bay is making a compelling case as an affordable yet promising investment opportunity in the digital marketplace. Web3Bay’s blockchain framework provides a secure and transparent environment where users can enjoy benefits such as 5% discounts on purchases and governance rights, which enhance user engagement and loyalty. By adopting innovative technologies like NFTs and offering tokenized rewards, Web3Bay is not just revolutionizing the e-commerce landscape but is also setting the stage for a new era of digital commerce that prioritizes consumer empowerment and security. As the platform continues to expand its offerings and user base, the demand for 3BAY tokens is expected to rise, potentially leading to significant gains for early investors. These presale achievements and the strategic advantages offered by Web3Bay highlight its potential to reshape and dominate the e-commerce sector through blockchain innovation. Wrapping Up While projects like Cardano and Solana continue to draw attention with their respective innovations and speculative appeal, Web3Bay focuses on delivering long-term value through a utility-driven approach. By eliminating common e-commerce challenges such as high transaction fees and centralization, Web3Bay not only enhances the shopping experience but also paves the way for the future of decentralized retail. With $830,000 already raised and innovative features like NFT integration and staking on the horizon, Web3Bay is not just another crypto token; it’s at the forefront of transforming how we think about buying and selling in the digital world. For investors seeking a blend of innovation, scalability, and solid returns, Web3Bay offers a compelling option, marking it as a leader in the next evolution of e-commerce.

XRP price surges 42% in a week XRP has grabbed headlines over the past seven days after becoming the best-performing altcoin in the top 10. On January 9, the XRP price was hovering around $2.32. After holding this level for days, the XRP price spiked sharply on January 14 due to increasing demand from traders. This demand came as the SEC neared the January 15 deadline to file its appeals brief in its case against Ripple Labs and its executives. As a result of increased trading activity, the XRP price reclaimed the $3 level, which was last seen in 2018. The XRP price went as high as $3.36 on January 16 before stabilizing around $3.32.

However, analysts believe this altcoin might soon reverse course and retest key support levels. Meanwhile, RCO Finance (RCOF), a new DeFi altcoin, has quickly gained popularity after securing over $11.19 million in funding during its presale. Which altcoin is poised to generate the highest returns between Dogecoin (DOGE) and RCO Finance (RCOF)? Read on to find out! Dogecoin Price Climbs 15% In A Week: What’s Next? Dogecoin has recorded notable gains over the past week. On January 9, the Dogecoin price was hovering around $0.3312. The Dogecoin price traded around this range for days before gaining momentum on January 15. This spike came after data from TradingView revealed that whales accumulated 470 million DOGE in 48 hours. This whale activity attracted hordes of traders, and the Dogecoin price soared as high as $0.3866 on January 16 before stabilizing at around $0.3841. This price means Dogecoin has gained 15% over the past week. However, analysts expect the Dogecoin price to correct downward and retest the $0.3500 support level as the buzz about the recent whale activity wanes. This explains why investors are shifting to RCO Finance (RCOF).

RCOF has captured investor attention because it has showcased impressive growth during its ongoing presale. As of January 16, RCOF had secured over $11.19 million in funding. Amazingly, RCOF has managed to raise these funds despite being in Stage 4 of its presale. RCOF’s price during this stage is $0.0778. This price is set to jump to $0.2142 when RCOF enters the Bonus Round, with more growth coming as this AI altcoin approaches its listing price of $0.4-$0.6.

Significant events are generating headlines for two of the biggest participants in the cryptocurrency space: Ethereum and Solana. The true action, however, is elsewhere: the smart investors are taking notice of Remittix (RTX) , a low-cap gem with the potential for phenomenal growth. Ethereum Upgrade Fuels Market Optimism The cryptocurrency economy has long relied on Ethereum and 2025 is expected to be another significant year. Significant improvements to the ecosystem are anticipated with the March Pectra Ethereum upgrade. From improved wallet functionality and account abstraction to advancements in zero knowledge cryptography, Pectra is poised to elevate Ethereum’s user experience, privacy and scalability. Core developers have already begun rolling out the Sepolia and Holesky features on Ethereum’s testnets. If everything goes as planned, the Ethereum upgrade might encourage additional users to sign up, further solidifying Ethereum's position as the industry leader in DeFi. Strong institutional interest is demonstrated by the net inflow of $166.6 million into Ethereum ETFs, which coincides with the technical improvements. Ethereum is battling resistance close to $3,400, displaying an inverted head and shoulders pattern that suggests bullish momentum. According to analysts, ETH may repeat its all time high of $4,868 following a breakout and if it maintains above significant resistance levels, it may even hit $6,000 in the future. However, in order to continue its bullish claim, the altcoin need to hold onto support close to $2,817. Solana Rides Meme Coin Hype The Solana network has performed exceptionally well, as seen by its price increase of nearly 32% to $253.22 in the last week. The surge is as a result of increased Solana network activity brought on by the introduction of a Trump meme coin that has taken liquidity away from other markets. This change has temporarily disrupted operations and because of the large volume of transactions, Binance recently paused SOL withdrawals, leaving customers anxious for regular operations to resume. The Solana network’s strong ecosystem and capacity to draw in liquidity make it a strong contender in the Layer-1 blockchain market despite this setback. Investors are making a bag from Solana's price momentum as it continues to surge. However, experienced traders are searching for more stable options, like Remittix because the meme coin hype rarely lasts. Why Remittix Could Be the Breakout Star of 2025 An increasing number of whales are turning their attention to Remittix (RTX) , a cutting edge payment network that combines blockchain technology with fiat transactions, even if Ethereum and Solana continue to dominate headlines. By allowing users to send bitcoin and have receivers receive fiat money straight into their bank accounts, Remittix provides a smooth cross border payment option. Remittix has raised over $3.7 million with a price of just $0.0221 during its presale phase, garnering recognition for its innovative strategy. The platform offers unmatched flexibility and financial inclusion by supporting more than 40 cryptocurrencies and 40 fiat currencies. Customers can avoid dealing with the hidden fees and bad exchange rates that are frequently connected to conventional banks and payment systems thanks to the platform’s clear flat fee model. What sets Remittix apart is its potential to disrupt the $183 trillion global payments industry. By combining blockchain technology with local payment networks, Remittix enables faster, cheaper and more secure transactions. Its API solutions, such as “Remittix Pay,” empower businesses and freelancers to accept crypto payments while settling in fiat, minimizing exposure to market volatility. Investors are particularly excited about the long term potential of RTX. With forecasts of a 25x multiplier during the presale and 1,500% gains after launch, Remittix is poised for exponential growth. Its smart contract has passed a full audit and plans to lock liquidity and team tokens for three years ensure transparency and stability. Conclusion Ethereum and Solana remain giants in the cryptocurrency market, with their respective developments promising substantial returns for investors. However, the real opportunity may lie in emerging projects like Remittix. Combining the best of traditional finance and blockchain technology, Remittix is redefining cross border payments and positioning itself as a leader in the PayFi space.

Major developments are capturing attention for two of the main players in the crypto world: Ethereum and Solana. Yet, the real action is happening elsewhere as savvy investors turn their gaze to Remittix (RTX) , a low-cap asset with the potential for remarkable growth. Ethereum's Upgrade Sparks Optimism Ethereum has been a cornerstone of the crypto economy, and 2025 is shaping up to be another pivotal year. The upcoming March Pectra upgrade promises significant enhancements to the Ethereum ecosystem. With features like improved wallet capabilities, account abstraction, and advances in zero-knowledge cryptography, Pectra aims to boost Ethereum's user experience, privacy, and scalability. Core developers have already started implementing Sepolia and Holesky on Ethereum testnets. If successful, the upgrade could attract more users, reinforcing Ethereum's role as a leader in decentralized finance. The $166.6 million net inflow into Ethereum ETFs, coupled with these technical upgrades, reflects strong institutional interest. Currently, Ethereum is facing resistance around $3,400, showing an inverted head and shoulders pattern that hints at bullish momentum. Analysts suggest that ETH could retest its previous peak of $4,868 after a breakout, and if it stays above key resistance levels, it might even reach $6,000. However, to sustain its upward trajectory, the altcoin needs to maintain support around $2,817. Solana Leverages Meme Coin Buzz Solana has been on a roll, with its price jumping nearly 32% to $253.22 over the past week. This surge is due to heightened activity on the Solana network, spurred by the launch of a Trump meme coin that has diverted liquidity from other markets. This shift has temporarily disrupted operations, and due to the high transaction volume, Binance recently paused SOL withdrawals, causing users to eagerly await the return to normal operations. Despite this hiccup, Solana's robust ecosystem and ability to attract liquidity make it a formidable competitor in the Layer-1 blockchain market. Investors are capitalizing on Solana's price momentum, but seasoned traders are also eyeing more stable options like Remittix, as the meme coin excitement is often short-lived. The Potential for Remittix to Shine in 2025 An increasing number of whales are shifting their focus to Remittix (RTX) , an innovative payment network that merges blockchain tech with fiat transactions, even though Ethereum and Solana continue to dominate the headlines. Remittix offers a seamless cross-border payment solution by allowing users to send bitcoin while recipients receive fiat directly into their bank accounts. During its presale phase, Remittix has already attracted over $3.7 million, priced at just $0.0221, thanks to its groundbreaking approach. Supporting more than 40 cryptocurrencies and 40 fiat currencies, the platform provides unmatched flexibility and financial inclusion.

Lord Barron Trump (BARTRUMP), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because BARTRUMP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Lord Barron Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Lord Barron Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Lord Barron Trump launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Lord Barron Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Lord Barron Trump by entering its contract address – D1na43rvB8ANQYK5KNJuYNK9RrAPaz9zevLGzw8DyZae – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like BARTRUMP. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|DOGE|SOL|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-21 00:06:00

But as is often the case in crypto, things haven't gone as planned for Dogecoin and the asset has been plummeting over the past 24 hours. On the sidelines, a rival altcoin at $0.0221 is emerging, that may soon eclipse Dogecoin. Remittix(RTX) is a revolutionary PayFi solution currently seeing major attention in its presale with its practical fixes for cross-border payment problems. Unlike Dogecoin (DOGE), Remittix is built around real-world practicality, and is taking the market by storm, with $3.85 million raised to date. So will Dogecoin (DOGE) bounce back from the brink, and how will Remittixfare this year? Dogecoin Sees Worrying 24 Hour Dip Dogecoin (DOGE) has wobbled its way through January, with some sporadic and short growth spurts throughout, most often preceding small dips. The weekly net gain for Dogecoin (DOGE) is now sitting at 15.38% but the asset has seen a rough 24 hours, dropping by 4.56%. Dogecoin is now trading at $0.3938 and its $7.26 billion 24 hour trading volume suggests many holders are selling off while others may be buying the dip. Much like other meme coins in the space, Dogecoin’s trajectory looks very uncertain as we settle into 2025. Remittix (RTX) Raises the Bar for Global Payments Remittix (RTX) combines the best features of blockchain and traditional banking to offer seamless crypto-to-fiat transactions. It facilitates the conversion of over 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat currencies and enables users to send funds to any global bank account with ease. Unlike traditional systems that often impose hidden fees, Remittix operates with a transparent flat-rate pricing model, ensuring recipients receive exactly what was sent. Unlike legacy systems, Remittix (RTX) eliminates hidden fees with its flat-rate pricing model. This model ensures that what users send is exactly what recipients receive, making it a more affordable and transparent solution than traditional banking options. Its instant transaction settlements are another key draw, offering users and businesses a reliable way to move funds across the globe. The Remittix Pay API is a major selling point for businesses, simplifying crypto payment acceptance and fiat settlement, allowing merchants to work effectively within the digital economy. Companies can even set up merchant accounts to manage conversions in over 30 fiat currencies and 50+ cryptocurrency pairs, offering optimal flexibility so that businesses can manage their finances in a way that works for them. Remittix’s vision extends beyond remittances, as it looks to bridge the gap between blockchain and real-world financial applications. The modular nature of the PayFi protocol means that it can integrate easily with different financial systems, which will allow it to scale in the future. Remittix Soars Past $3.75 Million Raised In Presale $RTX tokens are currently up for grabs in the presale for just $0.0221. The presale continues to build momentum, having raised more than $3.85 million from investors who see its massive potential to disrupt the $190 trillion global banking industry. Projections point to a800% price jump by the close of the presale and a possible 5,000% rally post-launch, making it one of the most promising opportunities in PayFi for 2025.

However, as often happens in the crypto world, Dogecoin's journey has been rocky, and the asset has been on a downward trend over the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, an emerging competitor altcoin, priced at $0.0221, is gaining traction and might soon surpass Dogecoin. Remittix(RTX) is an innovative PayFi solution that is attracting considerable attention during its presale due to its practical solutions for international payment challenges. Unlike Dogecoin (DOGE), Remittix is grounded in real-world utility and is capturing market interest, having already raised $3.85 million. Can Dogecoin (DOGE) recover from its current slump, and what does the future hold for Remittix this year? Dogecoin Faces a Concerning 24-Hour Decline Dogecoin (DOGE) has had a turbulent start to January, with intermittent bursts of growth often followed by small declines. Currently, Dogecoin (DOGE) boasts a weekly net gain of 15.38%, but it has experienced a challenging 24-hour period, with a drop of 4.56%. The cryptocurrency is now valued at $0.3938, and its trading volume over the past 24 hours has reached $7.26 billion, indicating a mix of holders selling and others taking advantage of the dip. Much like other meme coins in the cryptocurrency realm, Dogecoin's future trajectory remains highly uncertain as we progress into 2025. Remittix (RTX) Sets New Standards for International Transactions Remittix (RTX) blends the best of blockchain technology with traditional banking to facilitate smooth crypto-to-fiat exchanges.

However, in just a few days, the coin is already attracting legal and tax scrutiny. Fintax has highlighted three serious concerns about the launch of TRUMP. Critical among them is whether TRUMP qualifies as a security under US regulations. The US Security and Exchange Commission states that digital assets supplied through initial coin offerings (ICO) are qualified as securities as long as they meet the Howey Test Criteria. ICOs always make money by issuing crypto and pledging future returns. TRUMP has been launched publicly, but the team indicated on the TRUMP website that the coin isn’t a security. Besides, it has not alleged any future profits, making it difficult to call the meme coin a security. The SEC has not pronounced itself on the meme coin, but if TRUMP begins to act like a security, it will be under the SEC’s scrutiny and regulations. TRUMP is facing tax scrutiny, with the team holding up to 80% of the coin According to the IRS , profits from crypto investments are subject to capital tax. Trump’s team holds 80% of the meme coin supply, which will be unlocked periodically over the next three years. There is a dilemma on whether the unlocking event is taxable. US tax laws direct that capital gain tax takes effect when assets are sold or traded. Therefore, unlocking TRUMP won’t be taxable unless they are sold or used in transactions. The moment TRUMP is traded or exchanged into other assets, it will definitely attract capital gains based on the market price. Also, figuring out the cornerstone of TRUMP cost is a challenge. The US laws ensure that capital gains tax is pegged to the price at which you bought the asset. TRUMP has had wild price swings, making it impossible to establish the cost basis. If the team behind TRUMP sells the cryptos in sets, the capital gains will be calculated based on the timing and market prices of the batches. This makes it difficult to file taxes if proper sales records are not kept well. TRUMP could breach the law if used for political donations The meme coin is considered a potential controversy when it comes to political donations. The US law on Transparency and limits of political donations is very strict. If TRUMP is used to generate political funds, it could easily go past the set limits and break the law. Although there is no evidence of the coin being used for political donation, the idea of a politician launching a meme coin could have serious repercussions on the political donation systems.

Unlike other meme coins, however, the income from the sale of the coin will be used to pay off the U.S. national debt. Cuban laid out his plans on X, saying that the meme coin would work similarly to the $TRUMP token, with only 20% of it being available for trading and the release schedule being identical to the $TRUMP coin. Cuban stated, “If meme coins are the way, maybe I’ll issue one. With a twist. Same terms as $TRUMP. 20% float. Same release schedule. One difference: All the revenue from the sale of the coins goes to the U.S. Treasury.” He stated that the initiative is to leverage meme coin speculation to solve the U.S debt. Cuban added, “If you want to gamble, gamble. But at least use it to make a dent in the U.S. debt.” Cuban also confirmed the project’s transparency, as the Treasury’s wallet address will be shared, where the funds can be tracked. Cuban questions TRUMP coin’s impact on crypto industry In another post on X, Cuban Brought attention to the TRUMP coin, stating that its poor start will only make it difficult for the digital asset market to gain credibility. He cited concerns about the future of TRUMP and opined that the coin could jeopardize the ongoing process of regulating digital assets properly. Cuban referred to the growing pressure among American legislators to define new cryptocurrency rules. He also mentioned the FIT21 Act, which can help determine the legal status of digital assets. However, Cuban said that the launch of TRUMP is bad for the industry because it encourages investors to purchase tokens without fully understanding what they are purchasing. Cuban said, “Gary Gensler has got to be laughing his ass off,” referring to the SEC’s former chair. The creation of TRUMP and MELANIA tokens by the U.S. President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump just days prior to the president’s inauguration has raised conflict of interest issues. Although Trump has declared that his children will manage his assets after his inauguration, the creation of these tokens raises new ethical questions. The firms that created TRUMP and MELANIA said that these are not investments or securities but only an “expression of support.” These tokens come after other products with the Trump brand on them such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), sneakers, and even a Bible.

With a revolutionary approach to real estate tokenization, PCHAIN is transforming the $600 trillion property investment market. This innovation has fueled a surge in investor confidence, driving its market performance to unprecedented heights. Top traders and market analysts predict an unprecedented 55,000% upside for PCHAIN , eclipsing the XRP and Cardano price actions. The platform’s ability to bridge the gap between real estate and digital assets has positioned it as a formidable contender in the crypto market. Unlike traditional crypto assets like XRP and Cardano , which primarily serve as mediums of exchange or smart contract platforms, PropiChain introduces tangible asset backing through real estate. As adoption grows and its ecosystem expands, many experts believe PCHAIN’s current trajectory could lead to one of the most significant parabolic rallies in crypto history, outpacing even some of the industry’s biggest names like XRP and Cardano. The Rise of PropiChain PropiChain’s rise has been nothing short of spectacular. Unlike many speculative crypto assets, this project offers a tangible use case by integrating blockchain with real estate, a multi-trillion-dollar industry ripe for disruption. Through tokenized property ownership, PCHAIN allows investors to buy, sell, and trade fractional shares of real estate assets, eliminating traditional barriers such as high entry costs, legal complexities, and geographical restrictions. This unique value proposition has resonated with both retail and institutional investors. Over the past few months, trading volume for the token presale has skyrocketed, surpassing well-established projects like XRP and Cardano. The increased activity has also led to a rapid rise in demand for PCHAIN, further solidifying its position as a top-performing crypto asset ahead of XRP and Cardano. Why Traders Are Betting on PCHAIN’s 55,000% Upside The prediction of a parabolic 55,000% increase in PropiChain’s value is based on several compelling factors: Mass Adoption in Real Estate Inefficiencies, including slow transactions, high fees, and opaque ownership structures, have long plagued the real estate industry. PropiChain’s smart contract-enabled transactions provide a more efficient and secure way to buy and sell properties, increasing adoption rates among investors and real estate firms. Institutional Interest and Partnerships Major real estate companies and financial institutions have started exploring partnerships with PropiChain. These collaborations are expected to drive significant capital into the ecosystem, increasing the utility and demand for PCHAIN. Additionally, with the RWA tokenization projected to rise to $16 trillion , PCHAIN is positioned as a potential game-changer in the market. As an RWA altcoin, the token bridges the gap between the real estate market and the blockchain. A Shift in Investor Sentiment With crypto assets like XRP and Cardano readily impacted by market volatility, investors are looking for real-world utility projects rather than speculative assets. PCHAIN’s integration with real estate positions it as a high-value, low-risk investment compared to other volatile altcoins. Comparing PCHAIN to XRP and Cardano While XRP and Cardano have been dominant forces in the crypto space, emerging projects like PCHAIN are poised to take center stage with a staggering 55,000% growth potential. Despite its utility in cross-border payments, XRP has struggled due to regulatory challenges, including its ongoing legal battle with the SEC. Cardano, on the other hand, has been criticized for its slow development and limited adoption of smart contract capabilities. In contrast, PropiChain is swiftly executing its roadmap and achieving multiple new milestones. The project’s clear use case, strong adoption rates, and exponential growth potential give it an edge over already established projects like XRP and ADA. PropiChain: A New Frontier in the Real Estate Market PropiChain is transforming the real estate industry by using cutting-edge technology to redefine property transactions. The platform revolutionizes how real estate is bought, sold, and invested worldwide through four groundbreaking innovations. Immersive Virtual Property Exploration The platform harnesses Metaverse technology to revolutionize property scouting for investors and buyers. By offering highly interactive 3D virtual tours, the platform enables remote property scouting, breaking down geographical barriers and making real estate investments more accessible than ever before. This approach also facilitates greater transparency and seamless communication between buyers and sellers. It eliminates logistical hurdles common in traditional real estate dealings. Investors can assess properties in real time without physical site visits, reducing costs and time. Smart Contracts for Secure and Automated Transactions PCHAIN employs blockchain-powered smart contracts that automate crucial real estate processes. These self-executing digital agreements manage lease contracts, ownership transfers, and rental payments, reducing reliance on intermediaries such as brokers and agents. AI-Powered Investment PCHAIN integrates artificial intelligence to refine real estate investment strategies. The platform’s AI-driven virtual assistants and chatbots offer 24/7 support, assisting investors in navigating the market with ease. Additionally, the AI system evaluates market trends, forecasts property value shifts, and provides data-backed recommendations. This empowers investors with valuable insights to enhance profitability while mitigating risks. Real Estate Tokenization for Greater Investment Access Through the tokenization of Real-World Assets (RWA), PropiChain converts physical properties into digital assets. This enables fractional ownership of high-value real estate, enhancing liquidity in the market, democratizing investment opportunities, and broadening participation among global investors. Conclusion PCHAIN’s rapid rise past XRP and ADA shows the growing demand for blockchain projects with real-world utility. With a potential 55,000% market upside, traders and investors are joining the ongoing presale. According to top market analysts, your modest $1000 investment in the presale could yield over $384,570 ROI in Q1 2025. The first presale raised over $1.3 million, and the ongoing second presale has crossed the $940,000 mark. After this presale, the token price will rise by over 109%. Join the presale now to enjoy massive gains and a low entry price. PCHAIN is listed on CoinMarketCap , increasing the token’s availability and accessibility to potential investors. BlockAudit, a top blockchain security company, audited the smart contract and found no loophole or vulnerability.

At the same time, Shiba Inu whale activity has exploded by an incredible 830%, fueling speculation about its potential influence on SHIB’s pricing path. Amid this market buzz, BlockDAG (BDAG) is in the spotlight with its ambitious plan to secure listings on 10 tier-two and tier-three CEXs. This strategic move is poised to drastically enhance liquidity and adoption, with market analysts setting their sights on a possible $20 target for BDAG in the near future, as these listings elevate its market footprint and secure its position as a top trending crypto. Avalanche’s Bullish Sentiment Hits New Highs with 7% Price Surge The Avalanche (AVAX) bullish sentiment is reaching new heights as the cryptocurrency sees a 7.2% daily spike in price, reaching $35.90. This rally follows its bounce back from the 200-day EMA and the lower boundary of a falling wedge pattern, igniting optimism across the market. Moreover, Avalanche is making waves with robust social engagement, emerging as a frontrunner among Real World Asset (RWA) projects with 8.1k posts and 1.9M interactions. Rising Open Interest and trading volumes are signaling intense investor interest, raising the stakes for a possible breakout toward $40, with longer-term targets potentially soaring to $50 or beyond. Shiba Inu Whale Activity Skyrockets 830% in Just One Day Shiba Inu whale activity has skyrocketed by an astonishing 830%, driven by a significant uptick in both inflows and outflows from heavyweight wallets. On-chain data shows over 1.06 trillion SHIB tokens were moved by large holders, marking a 475% increase in just 24 hours. Despite this, the net inflows remained robust at 1.44 trillion SHIB, indicating heavy trading among major players. This surge in Shiba Inu’s whale activity raises the question: is this indicative of selling pressure or a strategic shuffle? As many of these transactions involve exchanges, this heightened activity could critically shape SHIB’s price direction in the days ahead. Why 10 CEX Listings Might Rocket BlockDAG to a $20 Valuation BlockDAG is setting up for a major breakthrough by aiming to list its BDAG token on 10 pivotal tier-two and tier-three centralized exchanges (CEX). This ambitious move is designed to boost the token’s visibility and liquidity, opening it to fresh markets and wider audiences. Expanding access through these listings is expected to draw both retail and institutional interest, sparking increased activity within the ecosystem. As BDAG becomes more accessible, surging demand is likely to drive notable price growth and cement its market stance. Equipped with DAG-based ledger technology, BlockDAG is ready for the expected uptick in adoption following the listings. The network’s capability for high-speed transactions and low fees ensures it can manage the influx of new users and increased trade volumes effectively. The scalability of BlockDAG’s framework is ideally matched with the upcoming liquidity and exposure from these listings, guaranteeing the network can accommodate rising demand without a hitch. BlockDAG’s forthcoming exchange debuts could ignite a significant price rally, building on BDAG’s already remarkable presale achievements. Currently priced at $0.0248 in its 27th presale batch, BDAG has surged 2380% from its initial offering price of $0.001. The network’s total presale revenue has already topped $182 million with over 17.9 billion coins sold. Market watchers now believe BDAG could reach a $20 valuation by 2027, propelled by the increased demand and liquidity following the listings. Missing out on this presale phase means snagging BDAG at elevated prices later, as its debut on 10 exchanges will undoubtedly position BlockDAG as a top trending crypto powerhouse. Which Crypto Will Trend Next? As AVAX’s bullish sentiment strengthens, its recent price rally underscores solid investor confidence and hints at further upside. Shiba Inu’s whale activity, marked by an impressive 830% increase, continues to captivate attention, leaving traders keen to witness its impact on SHIB’s future market value. Yet, all eyes are on BlockDAG, set to become a top trending crypto with its bold strategy to list on 10 CEXs. This audacious move is expected to ramp up liquidity, spur adoption, and potentially push BDAG toward the anticipated $20 mark. With BDAG’s presale price standing at a mere $0.0248 in batch 27, seizing this crypto presale moment is an exhilarating prospect not to be overlooked.

This development came as the DOGE price crashed violently after climbing to as high as $0.43 on Sunday. Dogecoin Traders Lose Over $60 Million In 24 Hours Coinglass data shows that Dogecoin traders have lost over $65 million in the last 24 hours. Traders who went long on DOGE suffered the most, with $54.81 million in long positions liquidated during this period. Short traders accounted for the remaining loss, with $7.90 in short positions liquidated. Related Reading: Dogecoin ‘Power Of 3’ Pattern Enters Distribution Phase: Massive Bull Run Incoming? These short liquidations likely occurred earlier on Sunday, when the Dogecoin price reclaimed the $0.40 support level and rebounded to as high as $0.43. However, the price action took a drastic turn later in the day, crashing from the intra-day high of around $0.43 to as low as $0.35, leading to the flush in long positions. Dogecoin traders weren’t the only ones who suffered significant losses. Other crypto traders lost substantial sums as the crypto market witnessed its largest liquidation event this year, with over $1 billion liquidated in the last 24 hours, according to Coinglass data. Long traders took the most hit, with $903.59 million in long positions liquidated. Meanwhile, $260 million in short positions were liquidated. These liquidations occurred as the Bitcoin price dropped from as high as $106,000 to $100,000, dragging other coins, including Dogecoin, along with it. This price drop across the board occurred mainly due to the US First Lady Melania Trump’s launch of her meme coin, ‘MELANIA,’ which drained liquidity from other coins in the market. Dogecoin traders were also bound to take a significant hit considering DOGE’s strong price correlation with BTC. As such, a Dogecoin price crash was inevitable as the flagship crypto nosedived to as low as $100,000. The Cycle Is Not Over Crypto analyst Kevin Capital provided optimism for Dogecoin traders, stating that the cycle is not over. The analyst also reminded those upset at Donald Trump and his team about the ‘TRUMP’ and ‘MELANIA’ meme coins that Dogecoin could easily have remained at $0.11 if the incoming president had not won the elections instead of Kamala Harris. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts When Dogecoin Price Will Hit $3 This Cycle As such, he urged Dogecoin investors and traders to be grateful for how far DOGE has come since November 5th, 2024, when Trump won the elections. Indeed, Trump’s victory was the primary catalyst for Dogecoin’s gains last year. The foremost meme coin had maintained a tepid price action for most of last year until Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E), coined from DOGE, looked likely to come to life as Trump led the polls. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.36, down over 8% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Pseudonymous analyst Rekt Capital tells his 531,500 followers on the social media platform X that the altcoin market is at a stage where it is being overlooked by most traders. But the trader notes that the prevailing bearish sentiment is setting the stage for altcoins to ignite upside bursts, leaving many traders on the sidelines. “February has been a strong month for altcoins in both 2023 and 2024. Could altcoins enjoy a strong February for the third year in a row? If so, then altcoins should be close to their ‘Lowest Hype’ areas before preceding upside over the coming weeks.” Source: Rekt Capital/X Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that altcoins are presenting prime entry opportunities for investors before alts top out in April. Looking at Solana, the trader believes that SOL is in the process of flipping a strong resistance level into support after closing the previous trading week at around $252. “Solana has managed to not only reclaim its re-accumulation range but also break out from it. On the cusp of fully confirming a breakout from its re-accumulation range. Just needs a weekly close above $250 followed by a possible post-breakout retest.” Source: Rekt Capital/X At time of writing, SOL is trading for $260, above the trader’s weekly resistance level.

Technical analysis from Ali Martinez suggests a potential bullish breakout as the cryptocurrency forms a falling wedge pattern, indicating possible price recovery after consolidation. TRUMP Meme Coin Forms Bullish Pattern Amid $54 Breakout Crypto analyst Ali Martinez observed a falling wedge pattern forming on lower timeframes for the TRUMP meme coin. This technical pattern is often regarded as a bullish reversal signal, with diminishing selling pressure and a likelihood of a breakout. Martinez forecasts that after a consolidation phase near the wedge’s apex, the new meme coin could rebound toward $54, reflecting an upward momentum. Following the meme coin launch , the TRUMP token experienced intense market activity, reaching a 24-hour high of $60. By the day’s end, it had declined to $40.25, reflecting a sharp drop in value. This 11% price drop, was accompanied by $31.82 billion in trading volume, suggesting heightened trader interest despite the downturn. Falling Wedge Signals Potential Reversal The falling wedge pattern observed in the TRUMP meme coin signals a reduction in selling pressure, indicating a forthcoming bullish move. This consolidation phase is crucial in determining the token’s next direction. The token’s market capitalization currently stands at $8.05 billion, with a circulating supply of 200 million tokens. The high trading activity and reduced selling pressure add to the potential reversal. Source: X However, despite the bullish prediction, the meme coin price saw its value drop sharply to $35.87, a 27.33% decline in 24 hours. Meme Coin Launch Raises Concerns The TRUMP meme coin, launched during inauguration festivities, has sparked regulatory and ethical concerns. Four-fifths of the token supply is reportedly controlled by affiliated entities, raising questions about market manipulation. Critics argue that such high ownership concentration could influence the token’s price movements and long-term stability. More so, a recent CNBC report revealed how the inauguration weekend made the first family billions of dollars richer. The TRUMP meme coin, launched Friday night, soared to a $14 billion market cap. $MELANIA, launched Sunday, reached $2 billion in value. World Liberty Financial, endorsed by the family, raised over $300 million through token sales, further boosting their net worth. Additionally, while the token’s launch gained attention, some analysts caution against speculative investments in meme coins due to their volatility. Mark Cuban contributed to the building concerns, stating that the meme coin poses regulatory and ethical challenges, particularly with President Donald Trump serving as both issuer and investor. He highlighted the conflict of interest this creates, warning it could confuse regulators and undermine investor confidence. Cuban further criticized the lack of safeguards for investors and argued that such projects risk damaging the crypto industry’s efforts Despite the excitement around the TRUMP meme coin, President Donald Trump did not mention cryptocurrencies in his inauguration speech.

Queen Melania Trump (MELQUE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MELQUE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Queen Melania Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Queen Melania Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Queen Melania Trump launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Queen Melania Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Queen Melania Trump by entering its contract address – FLQiU6SnMoM6HKN5cQqk32Cx9CY7StiBZuVyXRQ4fxCa – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MELQUE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|DOGE|SOL|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-21 01:23:00

The entrepreneur has left the position at DOGE to run for governor of Ohio. According to a person close to Ramaswamy, who was granted anonymity to speak freely, the politician will launch a campaign for governor early next week. Multiple sources confirmed to CBS News that the entrepreneur’s exit was due to his “lack of participation in the heavy lifting” at DOGE. Ramaswamy leaves DOGE amid frictions between him and staff 🚨BREAKING: Vivek Ramaswamy Out At DOGE Sources say he 'didn't do the heavy lifting, created friction with others, and wore out his welcome.' He sounds like the typical H-1B after all! 🤣 pic.twitter.com/uKNedQkoED — Sam Parker 🇺🇸🧯 (@BasedSamParker) January 19, 2025 After Trump’s inauguration today, DOGE is one of the projects he is pushing for in his second term. The 47th U.S. president had planned for the project to reduce government spending by up to $2 trillion by July 4, 2026. Ramaswamy was tasked with leading Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency alongside tech entrepreneur Elon Musk. Jennifer Jacobs reported earlier today, before Trump’s inauguration, that a source confirmed there had been friction between “rank and file” DOGE staff and Ramaswamy. A source familiar with the matter also told Jacobs that Ramaswamy had been subtly encouraged to exit as co-lead at DOGE. “It became increasingly clear over the last week that pursuing the governor’s race and running DOGE was not compatible. He’s leaving on good terms with Trump, Elon and the team.” -An anonymous source familiar with the matter spoke to NBC News. To date, DOGE has been secretive and has conducted most of its operations over Signal, the encrypted messaging app, and inside SpaceX’s Washington offices. A person familiar with the DOGE matter revealed that multiple executive orders related to its purview were expected in the first week of the Trump administration. He also said that the executive orders will include one that deals with government contracts and one that assigns how the DOGE workforce is embedded throughout the government. Trump also maintained that DOGE would not be a fully-fledged federal agency. The president said that despite the project’s name, it would only provide advice and guidance from outside the government. Politico first reported on January 19 that Ramaswamy could step down from DOGE before launching a bid for governor. The report also highlighted that a person familiar with the transition confirmed that Ramaswamy had informed members of the transition that he planned to run for governor. This morning, the biotech entrepreneur posted a photo of himself with Musk on X, captioned “A new dawn.” Ramaswamy seeks to run for governor of Ohio The politician challenged Trump for the Republican presidential nomination last year, but he became an ally and endorsed Trump after ending his bid in January. Ramaswamy revealed that he put his Ohio political ambitions on hold to help lead the DOGE project with Elon. Ramaswamy changed his plans on Friday after Gov. Mike DeWine appointed Lt. Gov. Jon Husted, another Republican eyeing the governorship, to the Senate seat. The biotech entrepreneur was eyeing the senate seat recently vacated by Vice President-elect JD Vance. Ramaswamy plans to vie for the governor seat with Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and state Treasurer Robert Sprague. Yost’s team revealed that Ohio AG had recruited Justin Clark, a veteran of Trump’s campaigns in his first administration, to be the general consultant for his soon-to-launch bid for governor. A Yost’s spokesperson and senior adviser also acknowledged that Justin was nationally recognized for winning some of the most hotly contested bids for governor. Yost also wrote on Friday night that as Ohio’s next governor, he will work with President Trump to advance his America First Agenda. Sprague also filed paperwork on Friday with the Ohio Secretary of State, which revealed his plans to seek governorship. Sprague posted that he would keep fighting to reform a broken system and “make Ohio the Midwest’s economic powerhouse.” He plans to seek the governorship. He posted that he will keep fighting to reform a broken system As Ramaswamy eyes for the governor seat, he has written two books exploring American politics, including “Woke, Inc.: Inside Corporate America’s Social Justice Scam” and “Nation of Victims: Identity Politics, the Death of Merit, and the Path Back to Excellence.” From Zero to Web3 Pro: Your 90-Day Career Launch Plan",News|DOGE,EN,0,0,DOGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-21 02:00:04

Stellar’s (XLM) price trajectory has also captivated market watchers, with a bullish weekly chart and critical Fibonacci levels signaling a promising long-term growth horizon in the crypto market. Amidst these developments, BlockDAG (BDAG) has brought on board ex-Cardano leader Marius Bock, whose profound blockchain innovation expertise is set to elevate its strategic ambitions. As the BlockDAG community braces for the eagerly awaited Mainnet launch under Bock’s stewardship, and with BDAG’s presale revenue skyrocketing past $182M, market spectators are buzzing about its potential ascent to $1 this year, positioning it as the contender for best crypto in 2025. 2024: A Landmark Year for TRON Network Revenue The year 2024 has marked a transformative period for TRON, showcasing significant growth in its ecosystem, particularly in transaction volumes and financial metrics. The TRON Network’s revenue soared by 119%, reaching an impressive $2.12 billion annually, driven by an expanding user base and broader global integration. The network’s total transfer volume has surged past $16 trillion, underscoring its robust capacity for extensive cross-border transactions. Enhancements in TRON Network’s financial stature were further supported by an increase in the USDT supply on the platform, which escalated from $48 billion to $62 billion. Moreover, the network’s decentralized exchange, SunSwap, was instrumental in the launch of 94,000 new meme coins, cementing its status as a powerhouse in blockchain economics and transactional prowess. Stellar’s Price Momentum Bolstered by Bullish Weekly Indicators The Stellar (XLM) price is gaining impressive momentum, as indicated by its weekly chart which portrays a bullish stance. While day-to-day price movements may seem volatile, a panoramic view through the longer timeframe illustrates a definitive cup-and-handle reversal pattern. Stabilizing around its 25% Fibonacci level at $0.375, XLM consistently demonstrates adherence to these technical benchmarks. Instead of focusing on short-lived forecasts, analysts are pointing towards the weekly chart where the support near $0.16 is deemed crucial for sustaining its bullish trajectory. From Presale to $1: BlockDAG’s Mainnet Launch Under Ex-Cardano Leader’s Vision The induction of Marius Bock, a seasoned leader formerly with Cardano, heralds a pivotal evolution for BlockDAG. Bock’s extensive background in fintech and blockchain, which includes significant roles at Visa’s Fundamo, IBM, and Cardano, infuses unparalleled expertise into BlockDAG’s leadership. His prior accomplishments at Cardano, particularly in infrastructure enhancement, highlight his prowess in pioneering innovative solutions. Under his guidance, BlockDAG is poised to confront blockchain scalability challenges robustly and carve a formidable niche in the sector. BlockDAG’s architecture, which integrates UTXO and EVM compatibility, already sets it apart as a distinctive entity within the blockchain arena. With Bock at the helm, the network is anticipated to achieve heightened levels of efficiency, facilitating swifter transactions and reduced fees. Bock’s leadership will also steer BlockDAG’s much-anticipated 2025 Mainnet launch, alongside a team composed of tech luminaries, PhD holders, and Harvard alumni. This landmark launch is expected to fully harness BlockDAG’s capabilities, drawing developers and enterprises keen to tap into its scalable solutions for DeFi and smart contracts. The BDAG coin has already achieved significant milestones during its crypto presale, amassing over $182 million and witnessing a value surge of 2380%—from an initial price of $0.001 to $0.0248 in batch 27. Analysts now forecast that BDAG could achieve the $1 mark in 2025, spurred by the transformative impact of its Mainnet launch and the anticipated wave of adoption. With the remaining presale batches dwindling and demand escalating, seizing BDAG at its present price offers a fleeting opportunity to buy in what could be the best crypto of 2025. Forecasting the Best Crypto of 2025 TRON’s soaring network revenue continues to underline its dominance, with extraordinary growth in transaction volume and ecosystem expansion witnessed in 2024. Conversely, Stellar’s price ascent is supported by a bullish long-term chart and its synchronization with pivotal Fibonacci levels. Yet, all eyes are on BlockDAG, where Marius Bock’s strategic leadership is setting the stage for a transformative era. His oversight is expected to amplify the impact of BlockDAG’s Mainnet launch, further solidifying its status as the potential best crypto of 2025 . With BDAG’s trajectory towards $1 looking increasingly feasible this year, the window to acquire BDAG at just $0.0248 per coin is quickly closing, making now a critical moment to act.

Insights on Dogecoin Whales & Filecoin Price Dynamics,https://thecoinrise.com/web3bay-the-decentralized-amazon-killer-takes-on-e-commerce-giants-insights-on-dogecoin-whales-filecoin-price-dynamics/,"The cryptocurrency space continues to evolve, with Dogecoin signaling potential growth and Filecoin gaining momentum from a recent exchange listing. However, it’s Web3Bay’s decentralized marketplace that’s stealing the spotlight. Positioned as an “Amazon killer,” Web3Bay is on a mission to transform global e-commerce by addressing long-standing inefficiencies and empowering users worldwide. With $830,000 raised in its fourth presale stage and over 220 million tokens sold at $0.004562625 each, Web3Bay offers a staggering 6,430% ROI to early adopters. Unlike Dogecoin’s meme-driven appeal or Filecoin’s niche focus on decentralized storage, Web3Bay delivers real-world utility through its borderless marketplace and low transaction fees. Can Dogecoin Repeat Its 2021 Bull Run? Dogecoin is seeing strong accumulation from large investors, with whales purchasing approximately 550 million DOGE tokens. This activity reflects growing confidence in the asset and signals a potential price surge. Analysts believe this could push Dogecoin closer to the $1 mark in the near future. The four-hour chart also shows a double-bottom pattern, a bullish indicator often linked to upcoming price increases. Together with the uptick in whale activity, this pattern suggests that Dogecoin could see significant upward movement soon. Market sentiment remains positive, with experts comparing the current scenario to Dogecoin’s bull run in 2021. If similar trends continue, the cryptocurrency could experience substantial growth in the coming months. Filecoin at $5.42: Strong Market Interest Despite Dip On January 18, 2025, Filecoin (FIL) was priced at $5.42, showing a slight 0.07% dip from its previous close. The intraday range spanned from $5.34 to $5.93. Recently, Filecoin’s price surged by 12% following its listing on Bithumb, a major South Korean crypto exchange. This listing doubled Filecoin’s trading volumes, highlighting the growing interest in decentralized storage solutions. Despite the minor pullback, analysts remain optimistic about Filecoin’s long-term prospects. Its consistent market performance and increasing adoption reinforce its position as a leading decentralized storage platform. Why Web3Bay Could Be the Biggest Threat to Traditional E-Commerce Web3Bay (3BAY) is set to challenge traditional e-commerce platforms with its decentralized approach. By eliminating high fees and limited payment methods, it empowers users to trade globally without restrictions. This innovative model positions Web3Bay as the next big thing in online retail, giving merchants and buyers equal opportunities to thrive. In its fourth presale stage, Web3Bay has already raised over $830,000 and sold more than 220 million tokens at $0.004562625 each. The platform’s final launch price of $0.1959 offers early investors a massive 6,430% ROI, making it one of the most lucrative opportunities in the crypto market today. Web3Bay introduces decentralized governance, allowing token holders to influence key decisions and shape the platform’s future. Its plans for NFT marketplaces and cross-chain compatibility further enhance its value, making it a comprehensive solution for global commerce. Small and medium-sized businesses can leverage Web3Bay’s borderless marketplace to connect with international audiences seamlessly. Its low transaction costs and secure infrastructure ensure fair and transparent trading, giving it a competitive edge over established giants like Amazon. By combining blockchain capabilities with practical e-commerce solutions, Web3Bay is positioned as a leader in reshaping how the world shops. Investors who act now have the chance to be part of this transformative movement while securing significant returns. A Quick Recap While Dogecoin rides the wave of whale-driven optimism and Filecoin gains traction in decentralized storage, neither matches Web3Bay’s broad impact. By introducing a decentralized marketplace with low fees and borderless transactions, Web3Bay is setting a new standard for global trade. With a projected launch price of $0.1959, Web3Bay offers unmatched ROI potential alongside real-world utility. Investors looking for scalability, innovation, and high returns will find Web3Bay to be the top choice.

XRP Whales Have Made A High Number Of Transactions To Binance Recently As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Qucktake post, the XRP Whale to Exchange Transactions metric has spiked for the cryptocurrency exchange Binance recently. Related Reading: Crypto Liquidations Cross $300 Million As Bitcoin Reclaims $102,000 The “Whale to Exchange Transactions” here is an on-chain metric that keeps track of the total number of transfers that are taking place from whale entities to wallets associated with a given centralized exchange. Whales refer to the largest of investors on the network, who can hold some degree of influence in the market thanks to their huge holdings. As such, this cohort can be worth keeping an eye on. One way to monitor their movements is through the Whale to Exchange Transactions. When the value of this metric is high, it means the whales are making a high number of moves to the platform. As one of the main reasons why investors use exchanges is for selling-related purposes, this kind of trend can be a sign that the large holders are looking to sell. On the other hand, the indicator being low can imply this group isn’t interested in trading away the cryptocurrency as it’s not making too many exchange-related transfers. Now, here is the chart shared by the quant that shows the trend in the 7-day simple moving average (SMA) of the XRP Whale to Exchange Transactions for Binance over the past couple of years: As is visible in the above graph, the 7-day SMA XRP Whale to Exchange Transactions for Binance registered an extremely large value just before the latest price rally beyond the $3.3 mark. Related Reading: XRP Surges Past $3.2 As Whale Activity Spikes 81% The timing would imply that these humongous investors may have been anticipating the run, so they made the transfers in order to appropriately reposition themselves. So far, XRP has managed to hold around its highs, meaning that the whales may not have yet pulled the trigger on their selling. It only remains to be seen, though, how long these investors would keep sitting on their profits, especially if the cryptocurrency continues its recent trend of sideways movement. XRP Price XRP has been one of the best performers among the top coins by market cap during the past week, with its price noting a surge of more than 38%. While the run started off strong, it has seen a cooldown in the last few days as the asset has seen overall flat consolidation.

Elon and Trump Bromance (ELONTRUB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONTRUB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon and Trump Bromance can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon and Trump Bromance could become the next viral memecoin. Elon and Trump Bromance launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon and Trump Bromance on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon and Trump Bromance by entering its contract address – 9ukUgm9iuVKXKkWVNnmtXgS5eMtxeiqbUThdJtLzaHXp – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONTRUB.

Pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton, known for his involvement in high-profile cryptocurrency cases, shared his views on the controversy surrounding the listing of TRUMP coin by prominent exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken. John Deaton Defends TRUMP Coin Exchange Listings Pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton has decided to address the criticism aimed at the exchanges for listing the TRUMP meme coin. Some people in the industry have criticized the inclusion of the token on exchanges such as Coinbase and Kraken based on ethical and legal considerations. However, Deaton further said that if he was still practicing as a lawyer, he would have recommended the token to be listed in these exchanges. John Deaton stated that the enforcement approach used by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could be a concern if a token linked to a former U.S. president was being traded. He said, “How could the SEC, in good faith, continue prosecuting Coinbase and Kraken for selling crypto tokens when they sell a crypto token issued by the President of the United States?” TRUMP Coin’s Market Volatility and Public Reaction Since the time that the TRUMP meme coin was launched on the market it has been quite volatile. Pump and dump schemes have also been noted, where the token was first traded up, but then faced competition from other meme coins including MELANIA. Crypto analyst, Ali Martinez noticed a falling wedge on the lower time frame chart of the coin, indicating that there might be a TRUMP Coin price bounce back from the current consolidation phase. The listing of TRUMP coin has also attracted controversy among the cryptocurrency community and in financial circles. Shark Tank investor Mark Cuban , who was less than impressed by the token, described it as “stupid and embarrassing” nonetheless, he conceded that it demonstrated a change in the US’s fintech stance towards allowing more innovation. Cuban also shared that he wants to establish his meme coin, and all the income generated from it will go to the U.S. Treasury to help pay off the national debt. John Deaton Calls for Transparency and Charitable Use of Profits Pro-XRP attorney John Deaton also gave unsolicited advice to Donald Trump and his advisors on the profits from the TRUMP coin. He proposed that any excess revenue should be spent on the American citizens who have been impacted by disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires. “This would prove the potential of blockchain technology as positive while putting America first and ensuring that President Trump’s administration leaves a mark,” Deaton said. He noted that such an initiative can help to demonstrate how the concept of cryptocurrency can be harnessed in the solving of social problems. John Deaton also added that Trump has become a billionaire on paper and therefore, has other options open to him after the presidency. He noted that redirecting the profits of the token could be a brilliant chance for the US president to use blockchain for the benefit of the society. Growing Scrutiny of Meme Coins in the Crypto Industry The listing of TRUMP coin comes at a time when meme coins are drawing both interest and skepticism in the crypto space. While the coin has achieved high trading volumes on platforms like Binance and Robinhood, its long-term viability remains uncertain. Critics argue that such tokens could harm the reputation of the cryptocurrency industry, while supporters see them as a way to expand innovation. Coinbase categorized the TRUMP coin as an “Experimental” asset, warning users about its volatility and risks. Kraken also faced backlash for its decision to list the token, though both exchanges have maintained that their platforms aim to provide access to diverse digital assets.

Crypto analysts speculate that if Ripple (XRP) continues its bullish streak, it could see a surge to $5. However, amidst this development, the market experts identified an under-the-radar AI altcoin, WallitIQ (WLTQ) , whose ongoing presale has grabbed the attention of whales in the crypto community. Let’s see why. XRP Price Eyes New ATH According to crypto market experts, Ripple (XRP) could be gearing to form a new all-time high as XRP price breaks past the $2.68 resistance wall. Ripple (XRP) also saw an increase that took its market cap to over $160 billion, making it the third-largest cryptocurrency in the market. Interestingly, Ripple (XRP) achieved this feat in just a few days, suggesting that the XRP price launched a massive bullish attack and traders shifted attention to the altcoin. Several crypto analysts have also pinned the bullish momentum surrounding the XRP price on the resignation of the US Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair Gary Gensler, which will take effect on January 20, 2025. Ripple (XRP), which has been at loggerheads with the US SEC under Gensler’s administration, believes it will see a favorable resolution from Gensler’s replacement, Paul Atkins, who is pro-crypto. Thus, crypto market experts speculate that the XRP price will surge to the $3.5 level in the coming weeks if Ripple (XRP) bulls can retain control over the bears. However, the XRP price is expected to see some consolidation and brief pullbacks before seeing a vertical explosion to $3.5 or even the $5 mark. Meanwhile, according to CoinGecko , the XRP price has surged to $2.81, just 17% below its all-time high of $3.40. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Attracts Whale In Its Ongoing presale As XRP price prepares to rise to a new all-time high, crypto market experts are also optimistic that WallitIQ (WLTQ) will see a parabolic surge in its ongoing presale. Crypto investors, including whales, have shifted investments into this presale to purchase the platform’s AI altcoin WLTQ, currently offered at $0.0420. However, crypto market experts are confident that the AI altcoin will soon explode in value to the $5 mark, giving all early investors tremendous profit on their purchase. Thus, millions in the crypto community hurry alongside the whales to bag this AI altcoin in large quantities before it skyrockets in value. Aside from the potential massive surge to the $5 mark, whales are attracted to the AI-powered crypto wallet on the WallitIQ (WLTQ) ecosystem. Unlike traditional wallets, the crypto wallet combines decentralization and machine learning algorithms to reshape the crypto wallet sector. The whales are no doubt impressed with the wallet’s sleek features, which include Scan and Pay QR, AI-powered predictive analytics , and a multilingual AI chatbot that provides 24/7 assistance when using the wallet. Recently, WallitIQ (WLTQ) announced the MVP launch of its crypto wallet management mobile app , which will allow users to test out the sleek features on the platform. However, since only token holders can take advantage of this opportunity, the whales, along with other investors, see yet another reason to bag the AI altcoin. WLTQ, the platform’s AI altcoin, powers the network and serves the purpose of utility and governance , allowing all users who hold the AI altcoin to participate in making decisions regarding updates and changes on the network. Furthermore, investors can gain added perks like access to premium features and exclusive content by holding the AI altcoin. Conclusion While the XRP price looks prime for a massive surge to a new all-time high, Ripple (XRP) is still at risk of major pullbacks if the bears manage to snatch control from the bulls. However, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has gripped whales with FOMO as they hurry to buy its AI altcoin in presale, positioning them for massive yield when the token surges above the $5 level. The whales are confident in shifting investments into WallitIQ (WLTQ), as top blockchain expert SolidProof has thoroughly audited the platform’s smart contract , and the AI altcoin completed a listing on Coinmarketcap. So there is no time to waste; buy WallitIQ (WLTQ) today!

BTFD Coin’s Presale Is the Wealth-Building Opportunity You Can’t Miss,https://thecoinrise.com/regret-skipping-neiro-btfd-coins-presale-is-the-wealth-building-opportunity-you-cant-miss/,"Meme coins have become more than just a trend—they’ve grown into a cultural and financial phenomenon. From Shiba Inu to Dogecoin, these tokens have proven that community-driven projects can generate both hype and real profits. But let’s face it: we’ve all experienced the pain of missing out on a hot ICO, watching as others made life-changing gains. Take Neiro, for instance. Inspired by the newly adopted Shiba Inu dog from the same family as the legendary Kabosu, Neiro has captured the hearts of meme coin enthusiasts. But if you missed its early days, don’t worry—there’s a new opportunity waiting for you with BTFD Coin , a project that combines exciting features, strong community backing, and jaw-dropping presale performance. BTFD Coin: The Bulls Squad and Referral Program Changing the Game Missed chances can sting, but BTFD Coin is here to turn things around. With a presale tally of over $5.3 million and a community of more than 8,700 holders, this token is making waves for all the right reasons. Now in Stage 13, with over 65 billion coins sold and the price at just $0.000142, this stage is 97% complete. Time’s ticking to join the ride before the price jumps to $0.0006 at the presale’s end. One standout feature of BTFD Coin is its Referral Program , a game-changer for anyone looking to maximize their investment. Here’s how it works: when you share your referral code and someone uses it to buy $50 or more in BTFD tokens, they’ll receive 10% extra tokens. Meanwhile, you’ll earn 10% of the raise amount if you make it to the leaderboard’s top 20. For example, referring $5,000 in purchases could net you $500 in additional tokens, all while building the Bulls Squad community. And let’s not forget the potential returns. Imagine investing $5,000 today. You’d secure 35.21 million tokens. At the presale end price of $0.0006, your holdings would balloon to $21,126. But analysts predict a moonshot to $0.006 post-listing, turning your investment into $211,260. Beyond the referral rewards, BTFD Coin offers an engaging Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, live since January 1, 2025. Coupled with its 90% APY staking rewards, BTFD isn’t just a meme coin—it’s an ecosystem designed to reward its holders. BTFD Coin’s impressive presale performance, lucrative Referral Program, and potential for massive ROI make it one of the top new meme coins to join for short term gains and long-term success. How to Buy BTFD Coins: Ready to get started? Set up your MetaMask or Trust Wallet, load it with BNB, ETH, or USDT, and head to the presale page . Claim your tokens and start stacking rewards today. Neiro: A Tribute to a Meme Icon Neiro is more than just a token; it’s a heartfelt homage to the newly adopted Shiba Inu dog from the same family as Kabosu, the face of the Doge meme. This Ethereum-based token is entirely owned and managed by its community, embodying the spirit of love and camaraderie. Launched with a mission to unite dog lovers and crypto enthusiasts, Neiro has quickly become a favorite among meme coin fans. Its grassroots approach and dedication to its community have fueled its success, proving that meme coins can be both fun and impactful. As Neiro continues to grow, it serves as a reminder of the power of community-driven projects. Its story resonates with both newcomers and seasoned investors, making it a compelling addition to the meme coin world. Neiro’s heartfelt mission, strong community backing, and ties to the legendary Doge family earn it a spot among the top new meme coins to join for short term growth and long-term potential. Conclusion: Don’t Miss Your Second Chance Missed opportunities don’t have to define your crypto journey. While Neiro’s early days might be behind us, BTFD Coin offers an incredible chance to join a thriving community with massive growth potential. With Stage 13 nearly sold out and a price set to jump, now’s the time to act on one of the top new meme coins to join for short term. Don’t wait on the sidelines while others run with the Bulls Squad. Join the BTFD Coin presale today, and turn this missed ICO into your biggest win yet.

ETH is consolidating above $3,120 and facing many hurdles. Ethereum failed to gain pace for a close above $3,450 and corrected gains. The price is trading below $3,300 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a short-term contracting triangle forming with resistance at $3,370 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it clears the $3,325 resistance level. Ethereum Price Stuck In A Range Ethereum price started a decent upward move above the $3,300 level but upsides were limited compared to Bitcoin . ETH failed to gain pace for a close above $3,450 and corrected gains. There was a move below the $3,320 and $3,300 support levels. A low was formed at $3,203 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor increase above the $3,240 level. The price tested the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $3,444 swing high to the $3,203 low. Ethereum price is now trading below $3,300 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $3,260 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,320 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $3,444 swing high to the $3,203 low. The main resistance is now forming near $3,350. There is also a short-term contracting triangle forming with resistance at $3,370 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. A clear move above the $3,370 resistance might send the price toward the $3,450 resistance. An upside break above the $3,450 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,500 resistance zone or even $3,550 in the near term. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,325 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,200 level. The first major support sits near the $3,150. A clear move below the $3,150 support might push the price toward the $3,120 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,050 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,000. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 zone.

Elon shared last year that the department’s goals include cutting three-quarters of federal jobs and eliminating entire agencies, going for at least $2 trillion annually. But Trump’s executive order has been met with immediate lawsuits and fierce criticism from watchdogs, unions, and public interest groups all together. Progress pic.twitter.com/iNAgAtPPCV — Department of Government Efficiency (@DOGE) January 21, 2025 Keep in mind that technically, D.O.G.E holds no official power to enforce its recommendations. “To restore competence and effectiveness to our federal government, my administration will establish the brand-new Department of Government Efficiency,” Trump declared during his speech after the swearing-in. D.O.G.E faces legal firestorm Among the first to file a lawsuit was National Security Counselors, a legal advocacy group. They claim the committee violates the Federal Advisory Committee Act of 1972, which requires advisory groups to operate transparently. The lawsuits also accuse D.O.G.E of having an unclear legal structure, with Public Citizen, another watchdog, demanding more details about how the group will actually function. The lawsuits named many defendants, including Elon himself and the White House’s Office of Management and Budget. They argue that the initiative’s lack of proper oversight could lead to chaos within federal operations. But history tells us that this isn’t the first time committees like D.O.G.E have been created. In 1982, President Ronald Reagan formed a similar group to streamline federal spending. Though that effort did end up producing a delayed report with recommendations that were largely ignored. Elon Musk speaking ahead of President Donald Trump: “It is thanks to you that the future of civilization is assured. We're going to have safe cities — finally — secure borders, sensible spending. Basic stuff. And we're going to take DOGE to Mars!” pic.twitter.com/jO7NRSzcAP — America (@america) January 20, 2025 Originally co-chaired by biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, D.O.G.E now has Elon as its sole leader. Hours after Trump signed the executive order, Vivek announced his departure on X, saying he wanted to pursue political ambitions in Ohio, specifically as the state’s governor. “Vivek Ramaswamy played a critical role in helping us create D.O.G.E,” said Anna Kelly, Trump’s spokesperson. She added, “He intends to run for elected office soon, which requires him to remain outside of D.O.G.E based on the structure we announced today.” Vivek, for his part, said in a post on Jan. 20 that: “It was my honor to help support the creation of DOGE. I’m confident that Elon & team will succeed in streamlining government. I’ll have more to say very soon about my future plans in Ohio. Most importantly, we’re all-in to help President Trump make America great again!” The Reuters report says that Elon’s initial focus for D.O.G.E will be on assessing which federal agencies are ripe for downsizing or elimination. Agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Department of Education are reportedly under review. A new dawn. 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/a3Vthjth69 — Vivek Ramaswamy (@VivekGRamaswamy) January 20, 2025 Tariff threats add to the drama Meanwhile, Trump has also ramped up his trade policies after taking office, issuing warnings to Canada and Mexico about potential tariffs. Speaking to reporters on Monday, the 45th and 47th president of the United States said his administration was considering 25% levies on goods from both nations, citing border control failures and fentanyl trafficking as key reasons. “We’re thinking in terms of 25% levies on Mexico and Canada because they’re allowing a vast number of people over the border,” Trump said. He added that the tariffs could take effect as early as February 1. The tariffs are part of the president’s plan to overhaul trade systems and protect American jobs. Analysts predict these measures could severely affect Canada’s economy, which trades over $500 billion annually with the U.S. Trump has also reiterated the idea of stricter tariffs on China, using TikTok as a leverage point. The president said he believes the tariffs could force TikTok’s parent company to sell its U.S. operations to an American firm. Trump’s return to the White House has electrified crypto markets.

Amid this landscape, the BNB and SUI coins are particularly noteworthy due to their dramatic price fluctuations and the broader implications for traders and investors. Meanwhile, Web3Bay is becoming the next 10x crypto, carving out a niche in the e-commerce sector by seamlessly blending traditional financial mechanisms with innovative blockchain technology, setting a new standard for online commerce. This integration represents a significant shift towards more decentralized and user-empowered shopping experiences. BNB Price Action: Navigating a Volatile Landscape The BNB token has recently encountered robust resistance levels, manifesting bearish trends that have influenced its market behavior significantly. Observers have noted a downturn, with the price dropping to $676.54, a 2.38% decrease, amid escalating selling pressures. This downturn is closely monitored as BNB approaches the critical support zone around $609.6. The negative funding rates on exchanges, indicating a bearish sentiment among traders, further compound the complexities of BNB’s future price movements. The mixed signals from the market suggest a cautious approach, as BNB might face further challenges unless it can effectively navigate these technical barriers. SUI Coin Trends: Potential Amidst Uncertainty Similarly, the SUI coin has been on a rollercoaster, displaying potential for substantial growth mixed with significant risks. Price predictions for SUI vary, with potential highs reaching up to $9.92, contingent on overcoming the resistance near $5.40. However, the volatile nature of the market and intense competition pose substantial challenges to its ascent. Additionally, looming regulatory changes could impact the adoption rates and overall valuation of SUI, prompting investors to maintain a vigilant stance on this emerging cryptocurrency. Revolutionizing Retail: Web3Bay’s Innovative Model Amidst the backdrop of fluctuating cryptocurrencies, Web3Bay is pioneering the fusion of Web2 and Web3 realms in e-commerce, becoming the next 10x crypto. This crypto is quickly becoming the market’s new sensation as shown in its rapid presale growth of over $830K within weeks. By melding conventional payment methods such as PayPal with cutting-edge blockchain payment options, Web3Bay offers a comprehensive and user-friendly shopping experience. This integration is not just about convenience but also about savings and investment growth; shoppers utilizing the 3BAY token enjoy a 5% discount on their purchases, enhancing the appeal of Web3 technologies in everyday commerce. The 3BAY token, central to the Web3Bay ecosystem, not only facilitates transactions but also serves as an investment vehicle with substantial growth potential. Currently, in its fourth presale stage, the token price is $0.004562, with projections pointing to a significant return on investment as the platform gains traction and the token appreciates in value. Looking Ahead: Web3Bay’s model exemplifies how Web3 can transform e-commerce, offering a secure, transparent, and efficient system that benefits both crypto-savvy users and those new to digital currencies. As the platform continues to grow, 3BAY tokens are voted as the next 10x crypto, further solidifying its position in the market. Meanwhile, the BNB and SUI coins continue to navigate the challenging waters of the crypto market.

Adding more credibility to this fact, a CryptoQuant analyst known as Gaah recently highlighted a notable trend: a large volume of Bitcoin—roughly 1 million BTC—has been withdrawn from crypto exchanges over the past three years. This trend reflects not only the increasing recognition of Bitcoin as a financial asset but also a notable shift in investor behavior. It also suggests a changing dynamic in how market participants view and use the asset in recent years. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reclaims Crucial Liquidity Level – No Resistance Left Below ATH What It Means For The BTC Market Gaah’s analysis points to a clear trend: approximately one million BTC have been withdrawn from exchanges over the past three years. This pattern reflects a growing preference among investors to hold Bitcoin off-exchange, a strategy that often signals long-term confidence in the asset’s value. Gaah wrote: This trend reflects both the growing global adoption of the asset as a store of value and a strategy against market volatility, using the asset itself as a margin in hedge operations. Gaah also highlighted that the trend first gained attention in November 2022, when significant outflows coincided with a period of market weakness. Investors appeared to be accumulating Bitcoin in anticipation of a notable recovery. 1 million Bitcoin withdrawn from exchanges in the last 3 years “The withdrawal of BTC from exchanges reduces liquidity and, consequently, selling pressure, which can support the price in short-term realizations.” – By @gaah_im Read more 👇https://t.co/sZHbF3r36m pic.twitter.com/DfFm4YtGWj — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) January 20, 2025 Now, two years later, a similar wave of withdrawals is occurring, but this time against the backdrop of Bitcoin trading near historic highs. Gaah noted: This contrast between accumulation during a bearish period and withdrawal after strong rises reveals the different market dynamics impacted by changes in behavior since the market matured. It is worth noting that by reducing liquidity on exchanges, these withdrawals can also decrease selling pressure, providing support for Bitcoin’s price during market corrections. However, the analyst mentioned: With fewer BTC available for trading, the market is preparing for new, more volatile price movements. Bitcoin Market Performance Meanwhile, BTC has so far been on a rollercoaster ride since the year began. After initially beginning the year with an increase, BTC was quick to face correction which left investors in despair. Related Reading: Why Bitcoin’s Ongoing Recovery Could Be Just the Beginning Of a Larger Rally However, as of today, the asset is now back in a bullish action. In the early hours of Monday, Bitcoin saw a notable surge renewing its all-time high after a breach above $109,000. This has caused the asset’s weekly performance to enter a double-digit gain. However, at the time of writing, there has been a slight retracement with BTC now trading at $104,782, marking a 0.1% decrease in the past day.

As of noon Hong Kong Time, BTC call options, which offer a bullish exposure in the leading cryptocurrency, traded pricier than ETH calls across time frames, according to risk reversals tracked by Amberdata. Risk reversal measures the difference between implied volatility for calls relative to puts, with positive values signaling a bullish sentiment. BTC's risk reversals show short-term and near-term calls trading at a four to five volatility points premium to puts. Meanwhile, ETH calls trade at a relatively lesser volatility premium to puts. In other words, the ether-bitcoin ratio is seen extending the downtrend. The ratio hit a three-year low of 0.03 early this week. The bias favoring BTC is particularly striking given that Trump did not mention the strategic bitcoin reserve on Monday, despite prior rumors suggesting he would. At the same time, a report showing GOP congressional priorities didn't include mentions of bitcoin or crypto. Traders on the decentralized betting platform Polymarket now see a 38% chance of Trump announcing a strategic BTC reserve in his first 100 days of presidency.

Lord Barron Trump (BARTRUMP), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because BARTRUMP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Lord Barron Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Lord Barron Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Lord Barron Trump launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Lord Barron Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Lord Barron Trump by entering its contract address – D1na43rvB8ANQYK5KNJuYNK9RrAPaz9zevLGzw8DyZae – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like BARTRUMP. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|DOGE|SOL|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-21 04:12:00

He signed an executive order allowing the popular video app to continue to run in the U.S. for 75 more days. According to Financial Times , hours after being sworn in on Monday, Trump pushed back a deadline requiring ByteDance, the Chinese parent company of TikTok, to divest its stake in the US or face being banned from the country. “If TikTok keeps operating past that deadline, the U.S. should get half of it,” Trump said. He also warned that he could impose tariffs on China if it refused a deal, calling such a rejection a “hostile act.” Trump awaits China’s agreement, or else he’d put 100% tariffs Trump wasn’t ruling out extreme measures and said tariffs could rise to 100%. But in the end, he says Beijing would agree or “we’d put tariffs on China,” he said as he signed the order in the Oval Office. “I’m not saying I would.” he said, “but you certainly could do that. ” The executive order states that the additional 75 days would give his administration additional time to determine TikTok’s future. That also reassures companies like Apple, Google, and cloud provider Oracle, which distribute or host TikTok, that they’re not going to bear the brunt of any punishment in the interim. Under current laws, these service providers could have been fined up to $5,000 per user. The Supreme Court upheld the ban, sending TikTok offline briefly at midnight Sunday. Yet hours later, service was back up after the company said Trump had given enough assurances that service providers wouldn’t be penalized. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew had been working behind the scenes to keep the app running, especially after Trump hinted during his campaign that he wanted to “save” it. Over the weekend, Chew even publicly praised Trump with tech giants Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg at Trump’s inauguration on Monday. Some U.S. lawmakers and security officials are worried that China’s government could use TikTok to spy on Americans or tweak the platform’s algorithm to manipulate TikTok users. Beijing has no influence over the app, as per TikTok claims. China, for its part, has made it clear it doesn’t want a forced sale. Moreover, ByteDance has said TikTok can’t be sold within the given timeframe anyway. TikTok would remain in the U.S, possibly under Elon Musk Despite the challenges, Trump insisted that if TikTok remains in the U.S. past the deadline, “half of its value” should go to the country. “If I don’t do the deal, it’s worthless. If I do it, maybe it’s worth a trillion dollars,” says Trump. Chinese officials are considering using Musk, who has close ties to Trump, as a broker for the app’s U.S. operations. Musk himself weighed in on Sunday, complaining about an imbalance. The video-making app is allowed in the U.S., but platform X is banned in China. “Something needs to change,” he said. Musk made an exception here. He rarely speaks out on issues sensitive to Beijing, as Tesla relies so much on China for both manufacturing and sales. Trump’s threat of tariffs over a TikTok deal has yet to receive an official response from China. But on Monday, its foreign ministry said that any decision about the app’s ownership should be based on “market principles” and left up to the companies involved.

Rising asset prices have elevated total assets under management (AuM) to an unprecedented $171 billion. ETP trading volumes across the globe also remained substantial at $21 billion, equating to 34% of trusted exchange bitcoin trading volumes. Trump Euphoria Inflows According to the latest edition of CoinShares’ Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report , Bitcoin recorded $1.9 billion in inflows last week. The latest figure pushed its year-to-date (YTD) inflows to $2.7 billion. Interestingly, despite the recent price increases, there were small outflows of $0.5 million from short positions, which contrasts with the typical inflows observed during periods of positive price momentum. Ethereum experienced inflows of $246 million, reversing its year-to-date outflows, though it remains the weakest performer in terms of flows this year. Still, these figures overshadow Solana’s modest $2.5 million in inflows. XRP added $31 million in inflows last week, bringing its total since mid-November 2024 to an extraordinary $484 million. Chainlink reported $2.8 million in inflows, followed by multi-asset products with $2.7 million and Stellar with $2.1 million. Meanwhile, Litecoin and Cardano each saw modest inflows of $0.5 million during the same period. The United States led the way with $2 billion in inflows over the past week, while Switzerland and Canada also saw significant activity, with $89 million and $13.4 million, respectively. Australia and Brazil contributed $5.3 million and $4.2 million in inflows, while Hong Kong recorded a modest $0.5 million. Sweden and Germany, on the other hand, experienced outflows of $14.5 million and $2.4 million respectively. Bitcoin Hits New Peak Ahead of Donald Trump’s inauguration as the 47th President of the United States, Bitcoin has surpassed $109,000, sparking expert forecasts of continued growth. According to CryptoQuant’s recent analysis , for instance, Bitcoin prices could reach $145,000 to $249,000 in 2025, driven by institutional capital flows, supportive US monetary policies, and historical cyclical trends. The incoming US administration’s pro-crypto stance, including crypto-friendly regulators and potential executive actions, is expected to boost demand. On top of that, projected interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve may further enhance the appeal of risk assets like Bitcoin. Historical patterns indicate that 2025, the final year of Bitcoin’s 4-year cycle, typically sees significant price gains. The on-chain analytic platform projects $520 billion in new capital inflows during this period, measured using realized capitalization. It is also important to note that institutional investors, including custodial services and ETFs holding 100 to 1,000 BTC, have already increased their holdings by $127 billion in 2024. Moreover, past cycles witnessed inflows surge from $86 billion in 2015-2018 to $440 billion by early 2025.

While Bitcoin (BTC) price maintained a hold above the $102K level, top meme coins such as Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Official Trump (TRUMP) have traded in the red territory. Notably, the global cryptocurrency market cap jumped nearly 1% over the past day to reach $3.52 trillion. Further, the global trading volume dropped 7.5% to $318.11 billion. Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) showcased a sideways trading session intraday. Besides, XRP hovered in the green territory. Here’s a brief overview of some of the top cryptocurrencies by market cap and their price action on January 21. Crypto Market Today: BTC Resilient Post-Trump’s Inauguration, Meme Coins Dip Despite the pro-crypto Republican U.S. president’s recent failure to mention crypto as a top priority, BTC has showcased potential by avoiding further dips. CoinGape reported that Trump’s Administration has failed to mention cryptocurrency as a top priority in a recent document sent to Republican lawmakers. This saga has raised severe uncertainties, contrary to the 47th president’s pro-crypto promises made last year. However, alongside BTC, ETH, XRP, and SOL have also showcased resiliency, avoiding major price dips. Besides, the meme crypto market has seen notable drops, with the TRUMP token leading the fall. So, let’s gauge in on the crypto prices today. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Today BTC price showcased a 1% increase in value at the time of reporting and is currently sitting at $102,725. The coin’s intraday low and high were $100,103.96 and $109,114.88, respectively. Notably, the intraday price chart shows a highly volatile movement, sparking contrary speculations as Trump takes office and the market eagerly awaits gains. Besides, a recent BTC price analysis by CoinGape reveals that expectations of new all-time highs are forming around the $120K and $130K levels amid broader developments. Ethereum (ETH) Price Today Further, ETH price slipped marginally by 0.3% over the past day and is currently trading at $3,257. Its intraday low and high were $3,202.49 and $3,444.28, respectively. Notably, a recent Ethereum price analysis by CoinGape revealed that the coin could suddenly skyrocket to $7,000. This bullish anticipation comes against the backdrop of rising whale accumulations and strong bullish technical patterns. XRP Price Today XRP price chart for today underscored a marginal 0.4% uptick at press time, reaching $3.11. The Ripple-backed crypto’s 24-hour low and high were $3.05 and $3.35, respectively. Intriguingly, renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez posted on X , revealing that XRP has broken out of a bullish flag. This hints at a $4.40 price target looming for the asset. Solana (SOL) Price Today SOL price slipped 1% over the past day and is currently sitting at $238. The coin’s intraday low and high were $232.40 and $272.15, respectively. Intriguingly, cryptocurrency expert “Ash Crypto” has recently posted on X , revealing that multiple users are unable to withdraw SOL from Coinbase amid the crypto’s rising popularity post-Trump’s inauguration. Meme Crypto Market Today Dogecoin price cracked 4% intraday and is currently trading at $0.3475. Notably, the meme coin’s slumping price action falls in line with the recent Elon Musk DOGE lawsuit that raised uncertainty among investors.

The price is attempting to break above its all-time high territory and while there was an attempt to do so a few days ago, it was not a sustained breakout. However, XRP is gaining attention, with upcoming developments like its ETF and potential IPO. The project is also expanding into memes and AI, and has formed partnerships with Cardano and Hedera. XRP is expected to continue to perform well and is expected to keep growing, making it an attractive option for investors. It is important to monitor the key $3 level for XRP. If the price dips below this level, it could indicate a shift in market sentiment. Micro structures are fragile and can change quickly, but the last support zone between $2.52 and $2.94 has shown strong reactions. After the triangle pattern completed, the price tested this support area, and the bullish outlook remains intact as long as XRP stays above $2.52. Long-Term Price Targets The outlook remains bullish , with key long-term targets on the chart at $4.19 and $5. These levels are achievable, and further price growth is possible. However, the exact movement will depend on the development of micro structures, which are to be monitored regularly on smaller time frames. Two Potential Scenarios Two primary scenarios are in play for XRP. The first is that the price is already in the fifth wave, the final leg of the current cycle, in line with Bitcoin’s movement. This fifth wave could extend, with targets between $6.61 and $9.81. These targets, though ambitious, are still within reason if the market continues upward.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|ALTCOIN|MARKET|ADA,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-21 04:59:29

The LBP sale is scheduled to start on Jan. 21, 2025, at 06:00 AM CET and will run until Jan. 23, 2025, at 05:59 AM CET. The ANLOG token will be available at a price determined by a transparent, community-driven discovery process, and all tokens that are bought during the sale will be fully unlocked at the Analog Token Generation Event (TGE). This will grant immediate access to contributors. (Source: Fjord Foundry ) Why Fjord Foundry? Analog decided to partner with Fjord Foundry because of its unique LBP infrastructure that guarantees fair pricing and equal access to participants. So far, this mechanism attracted a lot of traction as a trusted token sale model in the blockchain ecosystem due to the fact that it offers transparency in price determination and eliminates concerns about centralized allocation or unfair advantages. By taking advantage of Fjord Foundry’s infrastructure, the ANLOG sale will make it possible for contributors to influence the token's price based on their demand and valuation of Analog’s interoperable protocol. Fjord Foundry’s proven track record of hosting successful LBPs made the platform especially attractive to help with Analog’s mission of encouraging an open and equitable ecosystem. (Source: Fjord Foundry ) Additionally, Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools achieved widespread adoption as a preferred method for token sales because of their community-focused distribution processes. Unlike traditional sales, LBPs allow for guaranteed allocation and dynamic price setting, which creates a much more inclusive experience for everyone involved. ANLOG and Analog’s Timechain Solution The ANLOG token is at the core of Analog’s Timechain solution, which is a groundbreaking innovation that makes seamless cross-chain data and transaction flow a reality. Analog’s progress already attracted a growing community of developers and validators, and the LBP will be an new and exciting pathway for people to participate in Analog’s vision of a scalable, interconnected Web3. Overall, by integrating with Fjord Foundry’s LBP model, Analog wants to ensure that contributors dynamically decide ANLOG’s value while still supporting the project’s decentralized and interoperable ecosystem.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,TOKEN SALE|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|MINING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-21 05:00:28

The price could start another increase if it clears the $0.3650 and $0.3680 resistance levels. Dogecoin Price Dips To Support Dogecoin price started a fresh decline from the $0.4050 resistance zone, unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum . DOGE dipped below the $0.400 and $0.380 support levels. It even spiked below $0.350.

The next major resistance is near the $0.3750 level. A close above the $0.3750 resistance might send the price toward the $0.3860 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.40 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.420. Another Decline In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.3750 level, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.340 level. The next major support is near the $0.3380 level. The main support sits at $0.3250. If there is a downside break below the $0.3250 support, the price could decline further.

Queen Melania Trump (MELQUE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MELQUE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Queen Melania Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Queen Melania Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Queen Melania Trump launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Queen Melania Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Queen Melania Trump by entering its contract address – FLQiU6SnMoM6HKN5cQqk32Cx9CY7StiBZuVyXRQ4fxCa – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MELQUE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|DOGE|SOL|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-21 05:20:00

President Donald Trump has appointed Uyeda, a current SEC commissioner and Bitcoin supporter, as the acting chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) just hours after his inauguration. This appointment will last until Paul Atkins, Trump’s nominee for permanent SEC chairman, is confirmed by the Senate. Mark Uyeda has been a strong advocate for relaxing regulatory measures on the crypto industry. Alongside fellow commissioner Hester Pierce, he has criticized the SEC’s aggressive stance on crypto, including its controversial accounting rules. Uyeda’s appointment signals a potential shift in the SEC’s approach to digital assets. In addition, Trump has appointed Caroline Pham as the acting chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), replacing outgoing chair Rostin Behnam. While the SEC now has a Republican majority, the CFTC still has a split leadership between the two parties. This shake-up comes after the resignation of Gary Gensler, who stepped down from his position as SEC chairman on January 20th. Gensler had been a key figure in the crypto industry’s regulatory battles, facing criticism for his tough stance on digital assets. He had also been involved in blocking the establishment of spot crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs), although recent court rulings pushed the SEC to allow them. His departure opens the door for a new direction at the SEC, particularly in relation to the growing crypto market. Uyeda is expected to lead changes in cryptocurrency policy and reverse some of Gensler’s decisions.

Furthermore, the crypto community has also taken note that the President did not mention crypto when he swore in yesterday, leaving both the attendees and the crypto community confused.

While El Salvador added 12 Bitcoin to its reserves amidst record-high prices, the market as a whole saw significant liquidations totaling $1.28 billion, driven by sharp declines in major altcoins like Solana and Cardano. Bitcoin displayed relative stability, though its recent surge to a fresh all-time high has fueled discussions about its role as a strategic asset, including speculation over a potential US Bitcoin reserve. El Salvador Defies IMF Agreement, Bolsters Bitcoin Reserves Amid Historic Price Surge El Salvador, the first nation to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, continues its bold cryptocurrency strategy, purchasing 12 additional Bitcoin over the past two days, according to announcements from the country’s National Bitcoin Office. The acquisition comes shortly after the government struck a $1.4 billion deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which required scaling back some of its Bitcoin-related initiatives. On Jan. 19, the National Bitcoin Office revealed it had added 11 Bitcoin worth over $1 million to its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Another Bitcoin was purchased on Jan. 20 for $106,000. These acquisitions bring the nation’s total Bitcoin holdings to 6,044 BTC, valued at approximately $610 million at Bitcoin’s current trading price of $101,000, per data from CoinGecko. Notably, this purchase defies El Salvador’s agreement with the IMF, which had stipulated measures to limit certain Bitcoin policies, including unwinding government involvement in the Chivo wallet and making Bitcoin acceptance by private enterprises voluntary. The IMF deal, which provides critical financial support to the Central American nation, was seen as a pragmatic compromise to stabilize its economy. However, the latest acquisitions suggest that President Nayib Bukele remains committed to his vision of Bitcoin as a cornerstone of El Salvador’s financial future. El Salvador’s renewed Bitcoin buying spree coincides with a historic surge in Bitcoin prices. On Jan. 20, the cryptocurrency hit an all-time high of $109,000, surpassing its previous peak of $108,000 set in December 2024. This price rally, which saw Bitcoin briefly touch record levels, occurred just hours before Donald Trump’s inauguration as the 47th President of the United States. The sharp increase in Bitcoin’s value has significantly boosted El Salvador’s portfolio. As of Jan. 20, the nation’s Bitcoin holdings were up by $179 million, based on the Nayib Bukele portfolio tracker . This profit shows the speculative success of Bukele’s high-stakes gamble on cryptocurrency, even as critics point to the challenges faced by Salvadorans in adopting Bitcoin for everyday use. While Bitcoin’s price rally and El Salvador’s growing reserves paint a picture of financial optimism, public sentiment within the country tells a different story. A recent survey conducted in October 2024 revealed that 92% of Salvadorans do not use Bitcoin for transactions, up from 88% in a 2023 survey. Despite government efforts to promote Bitcoin adoption through initiatives like the Chivo wallet and the Bitcoin law passed in September 2021, the majority of Salvadorans remain skeptical of cryptocurrency as a practical payment method. The government has faced international scrutiny and domestic criticism for its aggressive Bitcoin policies, with many arguing that the funds could be better allocated toward pressing economic and social needs. Nonetheless, Bukele and his administration have remained steadfast, framing Bitcoin as a tool for financial independence and long-term economic growth. A Global Trend of Bitcoin Accumulation El Salvador’s Bitcoin strategy aligns with a growing trend among nations to accumulate the cryptocurrency as a strategic asset. Bhutan, for instance, has been quietly mining Bitcoin for years and reportedly holds approximately $780 million in digital assets, according to blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence. These moves reflect a broader recognition of Bitcoin’s potential as a hedge against inflation and geopolitical risks. El Salvador’s latest Bitcoin purchases signal that President Bukele remains undeterred by international pressure or public skepticism. The country’s $1.4 billion agreement with the IMF may temper the scale of its Bitcoin initiatives, but the administration’s actions suggest that cryptocurrency will remain central to its economic strategy. As Bitcoin’s price continues to break records, El Salvador stands as a case study for the integration of digital assets into national financial systems. Whether this gamble will yield sustainable economic benefits or exacerbate existing challenges remains a point of contention. For now, El Salvador’s bold experiment in cryptocurrency continues to capture global attention and spark debates about the future of money in the digital age. Cryptocurrency Market Faces Turbulent 24 Hours as Altcoins Plunge and Liquidations Soar The cryptocurrency market endured a volatile day yesterday, with significant declines across major altcoins and over $1.28 billion in liquidations. Traders were confronted with heightened market turbulence as Bitcoin displayed relative stability compared to other assets such as Solana and Cardano, which suffered substantial losses. According to Coinglass data , over 386,000 traders were liquidated, signaling a dramatic shift in sentiment. The total liquidations amounted to approximately $1.28 billion, with $816 million stemming from long positions and $307 million from shorts. This imbalance reflects the rapid price movements and adjustments in trader sentiment as market dynamics shifted away from recent bullish momentum. Bitcoin, which recently touched a record high of $109,000 on Sunday, experienced a modest decline of 2.2% to trade at $103,500. Despite the slight drop, Bitcoin’s performance remained relatively resilient compared to the broader market’s struggles. Major altcoins bore the brunt of the sell-off as risk aversion among traders increased, with many reallocating capital to stablecoins. Solana, a prominent Ethereum competitor, saw its price plunge by over 9%, while Cardano experienced a 5% decline. The broader altcoin market mirrored these losses, reflecting the heightened uncertainty and cautious sentiment among investors. Market analysts have warned of continued volatility in the days to come. Lukman Otunuga, Senior Market Analyst at FXTM, emphasized the impact of macroeconomic factors, stating, “Bitcoin’s sensitivity to US economic data and Fed rate expectations means traders should brace for heightened volatility in the near term.” Meanwhile, QCP Capital analysts noted a mix of optimism and caution. “While funding rates on derivatives platforms like Deribit remain elevated, suggesting underlying bullish sentiment, the market appears to be consolidating after its recent rally,” the firm observed. Speculation Over a US Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Adding to the market’s intrigue is speculation about a potential US Bitcoin Strategic Reserve (SBR). The concept has gained traction amid discussions about Bitcoin’s role as a strategic asset akin to gold. According to Polymarket , the probability of President Trump signing an executive order to establish an SBR within his first 100 days in office currently stands at 38%. If implemented, the SBR would involve the US government acquiring and holding Bitcoin as part of its national reserves. However, the policy faces significant hurdles, including regulatory alignment and collaboration with the Federal Reserve. Bitget CEO Gracy Chen highlighted the challenges of such a move, stating, “Establishing a Bitcoin strategic reserve within the first 100 days remains largely speculative. Implementing such a disruptive policy requires thorough planning, regulatory support, and alignment with the Federal Reserve’s framework.” As the market reacts to the recent turbulence, traders are closely watching Bitcoin’s ability to maintain its relative stability. Analysts suggest the cryptocurrency’s consolidation phase could provide a foundation for its next major move, though external factors such as macroeconomic data and regulatory developments will likely play a significant role in shaping its trajectory. The heightened volatility brings attention to the evolving nature of the cryptocurrency market, where rapid price swings and speculative narratives continue to drive both opportunities and risks. With Bitcoin’s role as a strategic asset under increasing discussion, the market’s next phase could have profound implications for the broader financial ecosystem.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-21 05:30:00

However, some analyst shared their bullish predictions as Bitcoin (BTC) hit its latest all-time high (ATH) of $109,000. Related Reading: $24 XRP Prediction: Bitcoin Maxi Calls It Risky But Possible Bitcoin Hits New ATH On Inauguration Day Last week, Bitcoin surged past the $100,000 barrier for the first time in over ten days amid the bullish expectations of January 20. The flagship crypto continued consolidating above this key level over the weekend, fueled by US President Donald Trump’s latest crypto moves. On Friday, the incoming US President surprised the crypto industry by launching his official TRUMP memecoin. The token saw a massive surge, hitting a $75 all-time high (ATH) and a market capitalization of $15 billion but facing significant backlash from the crypto community. As the token eclipsed the market, Bitcoin turned the key $102,000 resistance level as a support zone, propelling the price to a one-month high of $106,000. However, the market saw a 6% correction on Sunday afternoon after the then-incoming First Lady launched her memecoin, MELANIA. BTC dropped below the $100,000 mark before quickly recovering, closing the week near the recently reclaimed level. Ahead of Trump’s inauguration, Bitcoin’s price jumped 8.5% to its new all-time high of $109,588. Daan Crypto Trades noted BTC’s good start to the week after it “opened up with a small CME gap today but closed that straight away and went straight to new all-time highs,” adding that it will be an interesting week. Daan also signaled that today would likely be a “very volatile day in both directions” for the market but advised investors to “focus on what you expect for Q1 and not the next day.” BTC Price To Continue Soaring? Crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa suggested that BTC’s price could see short-term volatility depending on Trump’s comments during his Inauguration speech. “If a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is announced, I think BTC puts in a god candle, and everything sends,” he stated, adding that a lack of mention could start a momentary pullback. Despite the potential short-term shakeouts, some analysts highlighted that Bitcoin is entering a new price discovery phase. Rekt Capital stated, “History suggests this first Price Discovery Correction is now over.” According to the analyst, the December retrace was part of BTC’s “post-halving Parabolic Upside Phase.” Bitcoin enters a parabolic period that lasts around 300 days, each cycle after every Halving event, with the first price correction historically beginning between Weeks 6 and 8 of each parabolic phase. Related Reading: Solana Bulls Counter Bearish Pressure To Keep Price Above $240 After the recent price action, the analyst announced the second Price Discovery Uptrend lies ahead. He explained that “Bitcoin is now trying to breakout from its $101k-$106k range Daily Close above the $106k Range High resistance followed by a post-breakout retest would confirm the breakout and bring Bitcoin one step closer to additional Price Discovery.” Analyst Crypto Jelle highlighted BTC’s multi-year cup and handle pattern, which “looks like Bitcoin wants to get it over with.” The analyst suggested that the flagship crypto won’t “be waiting much longer,” adding that the long-term target remains $140,000. As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $104,564, a 1% drop in the daily timeframe.

In his first few hours of office, Trump has already signed other non-crypto executive orders, leaving the Bitcoin community waiting for any new pro-crypto directives. Trump signs multiple executive orders leaving out crypto Moments after being sworn in, Donald Trump signed multiple executive orders. As promised, he pardoned roughly 1500 convicted persons or those criminally charged in the January 6 Capitol attack and even started his immigration enforcement. Additionally, he repealed some of Biden’s presidential actions and dropped regulatory burdens on the oil and natural gas industry, which he argues will help to quell consumer inflation. Trump even paused Congress’ TikTok ban for another 75 days and withdrew the US from the Paris climate accords. However, Trump has yet to issue any pro-crypto policy directives. Trump and Melania launched their crypto tokens before the inauguration ceremony, which some investors interpreted as signals that Trump would support the crypto industry. They anticipated that he would cater to the industry’s needs and sign pro-crypto executive orders as he promised. The failure to give any directives so far, amid a slew of other orders, has crypto leads concerned. The top cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, even dropped by 1% to $101,300 as of 9:46 a.m. Tuesday in Singapore. At the time of writing, the price of Bitcoin had slightly picked up, trading at $102,196, representing a 0.30% dip in the last 24 hours. Other assets, including Ether and Solana, also tanked slightly. Ether is down to $3,243, a 1% loss in the last 24 hours. Trump’s official token is also trading down at only $32.75 , a 39.22% slump in 24 hours despite hitting past the $70 mark on Sunday. Trump and Melania’s tokens have evoked mixed reactions from the crypto community Trump was reportedly considering an executive order to make digital assets a “national priority.” Even before his inauguration, those close to him had hinted that industry leads should expect at least one crypto executive order for the first 100 days of his administration. During his campaign, Trump supported the establishment of a national Bitcoin reserve and even claimed he would make the US the crypto capital of the world, raising traders’ expectations. So far, the Trump and Melania tokens have drawn both criticism and support, with some seeing Trump and his family doing more harm to crypto’s reputation. Meme coins are still considered risky and joke-filled to many, so launching two meme tokens puts Trump in a light where he’s not taking digital assets seriously. However, some, like Ben El-Baz, managing director of HashKey Global, believe Trump’s family token releases emphasize his commitment to the crypto industry. Gautam Chhugani of Bernstein also expects that a meme coin based on Trump’s brand and politics could potentially last longer, arguing that these new tokens mark a “new crypto regulatory era.” From Zero to Web3 Pro: Your 90-Day Career Launch Plan",Bitcoin News & Insights|Bitcoin|BTC,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|ASIA|BUSINESS|COMMODITY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-21 05:39:18

These bull waves are happening thanks to Solana’s recent upgrades and whale backing, and it pushed investors to speculate whether we could see SOL at $900 any time soon. At the same time, projects like PlutoChain ($PLUTO) might provide a valuable solution to Bitcoin’s network constraints, with its own L2 technology that could improve scalability and expand its functionality. Now, let’s dive into this. Solana’s Rapid Growth: Speed, DeFi Adoption, and the Path to $900 As of January 19, 2025, Solana (SOL) is trading at $271.45 , reflecting a 15.16% increase from the previous close. The intraday high reached $262.80, while the low was $217.70. This surge positions SOL as a strong contender in the cryptocurrency market, driven by its high transaction speeds and expanding adoption in decentralized finance (DeFi). Notably, the approval of Ethereum ETFs has fueled speculation that a Solana ETF could be on the horizon, potentially creating a major surge in SOL’s price. Solana has recently broken above the 200-day moving average, indicating a bullish trend. Key support levels are identified at $235 and $222, with resistance levels at $280 and $302. A successful retest of the $280 level as new support could bring further profits. Rose Premium Signals posted on X that Solana has broken out of its consolidation phase and is experiencing strong bullish momentum. The price is now testing previous resistance, which has flipped to act as support, setting the stage for a potential rally. The first price target is $320.85, followed by $403.57, with Fibonacci levels confirming the bullish outlook. Solana’s robust performance and technical indicators suggest a positive outlook, with potential for continued growth in the cryptocurrency market. However, a $900 mark seems to be out of reach, at least for now. Could PlutoChain Revolutionize Bitcoin’s Blockchain with Smart Contracts and Expanded Features? PlutoChain ($PLUTO) is introducing a Layer-2 solution that could potentially elevate Bitcoin’s capabilities by adding support for smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Bitcoin has long been limited by its 10-minute block time, which makes it inefficient for handling more advanced applications. This has placed it at a disadvantage compared to faster blockchains like Ethereum and Solana, which have become the go-to options for complex applications. However, PlutoChain could significantly improve that by providing block time of just 2 seconds on its own L2 chain. This could allow developers to tap into Bitcoin’s strong, secure network while building dApps without compromising on speed. With PlutoChain’s testnet already processing over 43,200 transactions daily, the project is showing promising signs of scalability and readiness for a larger rollout. One standout feature of PlutoChain is its community governance model, which gives users the ability to influence protocol updates. This ensures that the network remains decentralized and stays true to the needs of its user base. Additionally, PlutoChain has passed audits by respected firms like SolidProof , QuillAudits , and Assure DeFi , further enhancing its reputation in the crypto community. Another exciting aspect of PlutoChain is its compatibility with Ethereum’s Virtual Machine (EVM) , potentially merging Bitcoin’s unparalleled security with Ethereum’s flexibility. This may open up a wide range of potential applications, including decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and even artificial intelligence (AI). Final Thoughts While Solana’s rapid growth and rising adoption position it for significant price gains, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) could present a unique opportunity to address Bitcoin’s network limitations. With its revolutionary Layer-2 solution, PlutoChain could enhance Bitcoin’s scalability and functionality, allowing it to support smart contracts and decentralized applications. As PlutoChain continues to develop and scale, it could unlock new possibilities, potentially making it a project to watch closely in the evolving blockchain landscape. The future looks promising for both networks, but PlutoChain’s technology could be a game-changer. ————- Remember, this article is not financial or trading advice.

He expects Trump to issue executive orders soon, allowing banks to trade and hold cryptocurrencies and offer crypto investments to wealthy clients. Trump, who has called himself a “crypto president,” is expected to push for fewer regulations and faster adoption of digital assets. SAB 121: A Barrier to Crypto Integration Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Allaire highlighted this potential shift, which could address longstanding barriers banks face in crypto adoption. A major challenge lies in the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121 , which prevents banks from keeping crypto on their books. Allaire criticized this rule, calling it “punitive,” as it hinders financial institutions from including cryptocurrencies in their portfolios. Although Congress once attempted to repeal SAB 121, President Joe Biden vetoed the effort, stating it was necessary to protect consumers. However, crypto advocates, including Allaire, see the regulation as a barrier to technological progress rather than a safeguard.

Solana Witnesses Increased Price Surge 2025 started on the bright side for Solana as SOL recorded a new all-time high of $294.33 on the 19th of January. Solana’s price increase is due to the positive sentiments surrounding the TRUMP and MELANIA meme coin, which have boosted trading activities lately. SOL trades at about $254.51, soaring over 45.25% within the past 7 days, indicating the token’s bullish movement. However, due to the launching of TRUMP and MELANIA on the Solana network, the influx of new investors has caused temporary congestion. This congestion has led to traders complaining of transaction failures during peak trading periods. That’s why SOL investors have turned to $RBLK for a smooth and profitable trading experience. XRP Reaches New All-Time High Ripple is facing another massive rally due to the high anticipation surrounding Donald Trump’s entrance into the White House. Following the hype surrounding the launch of the Official Trump meme coin, XRP surged to an all-time high of about $3.4, a record 40% surge this week. Additionally, the long-standing case between Ripple and the SEC has been called for dismissal by John Deaton in a post on X standing on the possibility of the Trump administration passing pro-crypto laws. XRP trades at about $3.16, surging over 28.1% within the last seven days due to the overall market surge. However, investors have switched sides, focusing on $RBLK’s potential for 100x gains post-launch.

From regulatory reforms to the launch of official Trump-branded tokens, his administration is making bold moves that are set to impact Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and beyond. Crypto influencer VirtualBacon highlighted these developments in his detailed X thread shedding light on what lies ahead for the market. Trump Went All In On Crypto, What Comes Next? Craziest weekend in crypto history? Trump's Official Trump Coin hit 100x in 1 day, and Bitcoin soared to an all-time high during his inauguration. Here’s how Trump’s pro-crypto policies could reshape the market — VirtualBacon (@VirtualBacon0x) January 20, 2025 The Trump Coin Frenzy Over the weekend with the launch of two Trump-backed tokens buzzed the entire crypto space: Trump Coin (TRUMP) and Melania Coin (MELANIA). Both coins, built on Solana, took the market by storm. Trump Coin reached an $8 billion market cap within a day, with a $42 billion fully diluted valuation (FDV), while Melania Coin hit a $1 billion market cap and $5 billion FDV. These coins have ignited a wave of retail adoption unseen since Dogecoin’s 2021 frenzy. However, U.S. regulations prevent further official Trump-branded tokens, making these two unique opportunities. In the meanwhile Trumps Solana, ETH and Memecoin craze can be a threat to XRP and Bitcoin in the near future. Pro-Crypto Policies on the Horizon Trump signed 80+ executive orders on his very first day however there are rumors that he will sign over 200 executive orders, many of which could favor the crypto sector. Key initiatives may include regulatory clarity for DeFi and ETFs, support for blockchain innovation, and even recognizing Bitcoin as a Strategic Reserve Asset. While large-scale Bitcoin purchases by the government seem unlikely due to budget constraints, leveraging the 200,000 BTC already held by the U.S. government could set a precedent for other nations. SEC Shake-Up Brings Optimism Moving on, the SEC’s leadership is undergoing a major transformation, with Paul Atkins replacing Gary Gensler. Expected changes include the withdrawal of Rule 3b-6, allowing U.S. users access to DeFi platforms like Uniswap, and the end of Operation Choke Point, which has hindered crypto companies’ banking relationships. These shifts, along with progress on the Fit for the 21st Century Act, could create a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment. Ethereum and Solana Shine Ethereum and Solana stand out as winners under Trump’s pro-crypto stance. VirtualBacon pointed to Ethereum’s strong ETF inflows, staking ecosystem, and seasonal performance. Solana, hosting the Trump and Melania Coins, is seeing record decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes. Macro Factors Fuel Bitcoin’s Bull Run Bitcoin is primed for a significant rally, with macroeconomic factors aligning in its favor. A potential Fed pivot to quantitative easing (QE) after the Jan. 29 and Mar. 18 FOMC meetings could inject liquidity into the market. Plus, a weaker U.S. dollar under Trump’s administration could further boost Bitcoin’s appeal. VirtualBacon advises holding Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana in the short term while monitoring tax reforms, ETF developments, and macroeconomic indicators for long-term strategies. With Trump’s pro-crypto stance reshaping the crypto market, the next bull market could be just beginning.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|SOL|ETH|ZRX,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-21 05:46:10

Transaction history suggests that Dogecoin and Cardano are gaining traction, with Rollblock (RBLK) quickly building momentum as its presale soars. Here’s why analysts are predicting huge 50x rallies in 2025. Rollblock (RBLK) Brings Innovation In Spades To GambleFi Niche Rollblock ( RBLK ) is a world apart from the usual casino platform, as it seeks to bring a new level of transparency to this 500 billion industry. Rollblock has seen a flurry of new gamers sign up for its blockchain-backed betting platform recently, recording a massive 600% surge in new registrations in December alone . Bets are fully verifiable on the Ethereum blockchain, meaning no bet fixing can occur. Rollblock recently launched its popular sports betting platform to enable bets on thousands of live international events including golf, soccer, and NBA. This, along with Rollblock’s 7000+ casino games, has seen a whopping $1.75 million in wagered bets last month, which could well double in January. Momentum is red hot, and the RBLK token is destined to ride high as a giant of the play-to-earn niche. It has a deflationary supply as each week up to 30% of Rollblock’s profits are used to purchase RBLK on exchanges before sending 60% to a burner address to reduce the supply. 40% end up back in the community through a generous staking rewards scheme. As demand for RBLK heats up this year, its price is likely to explode upward from its current presale price floor of $0.046. Dogecoin (DOGE) To A Dollar Looks Like A Lock Dogecoin has fallen by 5% today amid heightened market volatility. The Dogecoin token price hit $0.36 during Trump’s inauguration speech, as it emerged that Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is already facing a lawsuit for violating the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Musk will no doubt be on the offensive and Dogecoin is set to be thrust back into the spotlight once again in the coming days. Many Dogecoin holders are holding tight and waiting for the price to hit $1. This is now only a 3x away and Dogecoin could easily reach this target during the next season of meme mania. Cardano (ADA) Whales Take Profits After Rally Cardano has rallied enormously in recent weeks, gaining 14% in the last month of trading to hit $1.04. Cardano’s market cap has now reached 36 billion, as it has emerged that whales have been taking profits recently after the recent run-up. Realized profits of Cardano traders grew to a weekly high of $73 million on January 15, following Cardano’s rally to $1.15. Whale netflows on the Cardano chain have declined as the top 0.1% of Cardano holders have locked in some profits at these levels. This is bullish as it means that the coast is now clear for Cardano to continue its golden run towards all-time highs. Cardano could easily reach $3 in Q1 given recent momentum. Whales Continue To Flock To Rollblock Whales have been rotating away from large-cap projects such as Dogecoin and Cardano, to build a position in the hugely promising Rollblock (RBLK) startup. Investors have been using this knowledge to copy-trade and make an allocation while the Rollblock price remains so low at $0.046. Stage 9 tokens are more than 70% sold out already as a result and the price is likely to explode northwards this year. Discover the Exciting Opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) Presale Today!

Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who’s been closely associated with the Trump team has confirmed the decision on the same. “Ross will be freed too,” said Musk in a response to a post on a social media platform. Silk Road Founder Ross Ulbricht To Be Out of Prison Soon Silk Road’s Ross Ulbricht has yet to receive an official communication from Donald Trump for lifting his prison sentence. Back during his presidential campaign last year, Trump stated: “If you vote for me, on day one, I will commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht”. As Trump signed several executive orders at the Oval Office after the inauguration ceremony, everyone is waiting for Trump to pardon Ulbricht after 11 years in prison. Trump’s close associate and tech billionaire Elon Musk has confirmed the Silk Road founder’s release. Ross will be freed too — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 21, 2025 Angela McArdle, chair of the Libertarian National Committee (LNC), announced that Ross Ulbricht is likely to receive a presidential pardon within the next 24 to 48 hours. In a message on the X platform, McArdle wrote : “Pres. Trump’s staff just confirmed to me Ross’s pardon will be issued late tonight or tomorrow morning”. Elon Musk also confirmed the same in a recent X post response, which has further fueled market optimism. Notably, as per Ross Ulbricht’s post on X last May 2024, Trump will “commute” the sentence for the Silk Road founder. This means that the severity of the punishment or the prison term would be reduced. Thus, it will be interesting to see whether Trump takes a step further to pardon the sentence, meaning complete forgiveness. No Crypto Executive Order On Day 1? While the broader crypto industry had high hopes from President Donald Trump of having a crypto executive order on the first day, there’s no such development so far. There have been mixed reactions to this development. Anonymous crypto handle that goes by the name “Flood” noted: “NO ROSS PARDON, NO LEGALIZATION OF PERPETUAL SWAPS AND NO CRYPTO EXECUTIVE ORDER HAVE WE BEEN BAMBOOZLED BY THE TRUMP CRIME FAMILY?”. However, other experts have asked the industry to maintain patience for the same. Sharing his thoughts on the same, popular crypto analyst Miles Deutscher highlighted positive developments surrounding Ross Ulbricht’s pardon and said: “Tbh, it was unlikely Trump was going to mention crypto in his speech anyway. What matters is what happens over the coming days. There are already reports of pardoning Ross Ulbricht + and an executive order to allow banks to more easily hold digital assets. Patience”. TRUMP Meme Coin Tanks 40% Following the January 20 inauguration, the Official Trump (TRUMP) meme coin has collapsed 40% dropping to $32 as of press time. Similarly, the Official Melania Meme (MELANIA) is down by 60%, a day after its launch. The launch of meme coins by the Trump family has received severe criticism from several experts, including some from the crypto industry. Billionaire investor Mark Cuban has voiced criticism of the TRUMP meme coin, labeling it overly speculative. Cuban expressed concerns about the token’s potential to harm cryptocurrency credibility and exacerbate regulatory challenges for the broader market The post Silk Road’s Ross Ulbricht To Be Free, Confirms Elon Musk appeared first on CoinGape .",24/7 Cryptocurrency News|Donald Trump|Elon Musk News|ross ulbricht|Silk road,EN,0,0,MARKET|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinGape', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coingape,2025-01-21 06:01:45

It offers local companies the ability to use their AI chips for “inference” tasks. To “train” LLMs, major AI companies in China depend on GPUs developed by Nvidia. The company stands at 3.4 trillion and is seen as an essential part of improving AI technology. According to a Financial Times report , Huawei is promoting its new Ascend AI processors for Chinese groups that are considering “inference” as an option. Inference is the function that LLMs use to create prompt responses. The senior AI researcher of inference acceleration for Huawei’s Zurich lab, Georgios Zacharopoulos, says, “Training is important, but it only occurs a few times.” He said the company will serve more customers by focusing on inference. Huawei is seen as a strong competitor for Nvidia in China Nvidia’s prominent rival in the local market is using AI models trained on Nvidia’s products on the Ascend chips. According to employees and customers, Huawei’s direction has fewer technical challenges and can generate high profits. The company has also provided a tool to fill the gap between the different software used by Nvidia GPUs and Ascend. The Chinese government is also fully supporting Huawei’s promotions. Officials are asking local tech companies to use Huawei AI chips instead of Nvidia. One source associated with Nvidia’s operations in China said that the company is also seen internally as the country’s most serious rival since its chip design is more “advanced.” Unlike US tech giants OpenAI and Google, Chinese companies face the challenge of accessing the best-quality GPUs. Due to US limitations on exports, Nvidia only provides China with lower-quality H20 chips. Nonetheless, these chips remain in high demand in China, and they are still better than the ones manufactured locally.

Bitcoin Sheds 5% After Trump Inauguration After surging to a new record high of $108,786 on Monday morning, Bitcoin lost 5% of its value to trade at $103,279 as of press time. President Trump’s Official TRUMP also succumbed to selling pressure, plunging over 43% over the last 24 hours to change hands at $38.60. In his inauguration speech, Trump trumpeted his support for innovation, though he didn’t specifically make mention of crypto. “There’s no nation like our nation,” Trump declared. “Americans are explorers, builders, innovators, entrepreneurs, and pioneers. The spirit of the frontier is written into our hearts.” Many crypto observers had expected the new president to address crypto in some form, including discussing the establishment of the highly-awaited national Bitcoin strategic reserve. Others speculated that he might mention the $TRUMP and $MELANIA meme coins that launched over the weekend and sparked a speculative frenzy. However, he did not mention these newly launched meme coins either. Trump’s Plans For Bitcoin While the previous Biden administration lodged unrelenting attacks on the nascent crypto industry over the last four years, Trump has vowed to nurture the crypto industry, appoint pro-crypto regulators, and allow entrepreneurs to launch products without fear of lawsuits. Previously skeptical, Trump has repeatedly voiced support for Bitcoin as a strategic asset, outlining plans for the creation of a U.S. BTC reserve to boost economic stability. It was revealed last week that Trump is reportedly poised to issue executive orders that encompass abolishing the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s controversial accounting guidance. The new administration is also planning to issue an executive order to set digital assets as a “ national priority .” Overall, traders are hoping that a slew of Trump-issued crypto executive orders in the coming days will embolden the bulls and reverse the current bearish price movement.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|TRADING|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-21 06:10:35

Cardano also shows resilience and is holding its ground at the $1 price level despite experiencing a massive sell-off on Sunday. While these top altcoins recover analysts are making optimistic projections for Rollblock’s new GambleFi project, which has recently received a CoinMarketCap listing. Predictions about RBLK hitting the $2 mark after its official launch are already taking over the market, making investors jump ship to this DeFi utility altcoin before the limited presale tokens run out. Rollblock (RBLK) Could Jump to $2 After CoinMarketCap Listing Rollblock’s explosive GambleFi project is emerging as one of the top utility tokens of 2025 with its massive adoption rate. After the recent CoinMarketCap listing, Rollblock has gained thousands of new investors because of the optimistic community sentiment. As Rollblock continues to shine as a low-cap DeFi token, analysts expect to see the price reach as high as $2 once RBLK is released on the open market. Market experts are attributing Rollblock’s rapid growth to the revolutionary iGambling platform that offers on-chain gaming opportunities. Users can play 7,000+ casino games which include classics like roulette and slots and newer Web3-powered titles like Darts and Keno. Rollblock has also released an exclusive sports betting feature to expand the GambleFi ecosystem, allowing users to place bets on top international sports leagues using their cryptocurrency. All in-game payouts on Rollblock are made using the native RBLK token which powers the entire ecosystem. Token holders also receive exclusive benefits like cashback rewards, rakebacks, and a portion of Rollblock’s weekly revenue. Every week, Rollblock invests up to 30% of its casino returns into open market buybacks of RBLK. While 60% of these tokens are burned to put deflationary pressure on the price, the remaining 40% are distributed to current RBLK holders as staking rewards. This passive income opportunity is already attracting thousands of investors to Rollblock’s GambleFi project who can earn big through the platform’s provably fair gaming odds. Every bet is encrypted on Ethereum, making it impossible to alter or change bets once they are placed. RBLK tokens are currently selling for only $0.046, making Rollblock an attractive buying opportunity for savvy traders who want to diversify their portfolios with a low-cap DeFi altcoin. Analysts are already projecting up to 880% pre-launch returns for RBLK holders, making now the ideal time to invest before the price skyrockets to a new peak during the next presale stage. Solana (SOL) Generates $35 Million in Fees During TRUMP Frenzy President-elect Donald Trump’s official token was released on Solana’s blockchain on Saturday, resulting in a massive spike in Solana’s trading volume. Between Saturday and Sunday, Solana generated more than $35 million in fees. Despite being a low-cost blockchain, Solana generated at least $14 million in revenue over the weekend because of the TRUMP frenzy. Thanks to the high demand, Solana jumped to a new all-time high price level above $270. After a minor pullback of 6.6%, Solana is currently trading for $256.44. Despite the price correction, Solana is still trading above all of its Exponential Moving Averages on the SOL/USDT daily chart which confirms the ongoing upward momentum. If Solana buyers continue dominating the market, Solana could test a new high at the $275 level in the next few weeks. Cardano (ADA) Reclaims $1 Price Level After Massive Sell-Off on Sunday Cardano faced an unexpected 11.45% decline in value on Sunday, the largest single-day percentage loss since early January. The sudden dip was triggered by a sell-off as Cardano was previously facing significant resistance at the $1 level. Despite the pullback, Cardano has managed to prove its resilience by reclaiming the $1 position. Cardano is currently trading for $1.07 after an intraday decrease of 0.23%. Cardano’s trading volume is still up by 34.65% in the last 24 hours which suggests increased market participation. Cardano is also trading above all of its Exponential Moving Averages on the daily chart which confirms bullish dominance in the market. Since Cardano’s RSI suggests room for more growth, Cardano’s price could test the R2 resistance at $1.54 soon. Can RBLK Record a Bigger Rally Than SOL and ADA in Q1? Solana and Cardano are experiencing significant price fluctuations this week, making them risky investment opportunities. Meanwhile, Rollblock has gained the trust of thousands of early investors by delivering up to 360% return on investment. Given Rollblock’s recent CoinMarketCap listing, RBLK is likely to experience a bigger rally than both SOL and ADA during Q1 of 2025.

The president is also yet to commute Ross Ulbricht’s Silk Road prison sentence. The president did not mention repealing Biden’s EO 14067, which was the executive order on digital assets that enabled Chokepoint 2.0. Biden and a group of U.S. regulators initiated the Operation Choke Point 2.0 program to restrict the crypto industry’s access to the banking system. Trump fails to repeal Biden’s 14067 executive order Trump’s repeal of Biden EO’s did not include 14067 which was the executive order on digital assets that enabled Chokepoint 2.0 So career officials at regulatory offices still currently have broad over reach powers against entities dealing with crypto…. — Adam Cochran (adamscochran.eth) (@adamscochran) January 21, 2025 Donald Trump was inaugurated yesterday as the 47th president of the United States, and the world was waiting for him to deliver his promises on his first day in office. The crypto community was waiting for Trump to revoke Biden’s 14067 executive order as promised, but it did not happen. “As president, I will immediately shut down Operation Choke Point 2.0. They want to choke you out of business; we’re not going to let that happen.” ~ Donald Trump , U.S. President, at the 2024 Bitcoin conference. Executive order 14067 , titled “Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets,” was signed on March 9, 2022. Crypto businesses that had long been overshadowed by the executive order, as well as observers aware of its unfair targeting of the industry, were shocked that Trump did not mention it yesterday. Adam Cochran, a financial expert, posted that Trump’s repeal of Biden EO’s did not include 14067. Cochran believes that career officials at regulatory offices still had broad overreach powers against entities dealing with crypto. The finance guru expressed his distress after Trump repealed 78 EOs, but “couldn’t even get the digital assets one.” Cochran also said he was displeased that Trump had time to remove parts of the inflation reduction act, but none of the crypto day one promises. One user argued that Trump had just gotten into office and that his recent purchases on crypto still made him bullish. He also revealed that it might be bad for traders in the short term, especially those who banked on Trump to sign the order yesterday. Cochran stated that of all the day one crypto promises, the one that will hurt people the most is the “free Ross” one. Trump told attendees at the 2024 Libertarian National Convention in May last year that he would commute Ross Ulbricht’s sentence once he is in office. Choke Point 2.0 limits the crypto ecosystem Choke Point 2.0 was considered a successor to the original Operation Choke Point, launched under the Obama administration in 2013 and terminated by Trump in 2017. Both initiatives investigated banks and their relationships with certain high-risk industries to combat fraud and money laundering. Biden’s administration had denied the existence of Operation Choke Point 2.0, but critics argued that enforcement actions by several regulators had proven its existing operations. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Federal Deposit and Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) were believed to discourage banks from providing crypto services to crypto firms. The operation became clear after the federal regulators issued a joint statement in January 2023 warning banks about crypto asset risks. The decision was followed by the collapse of two major players in the crypto banking industry, Silvergate Bank and Signature Bank. Signature Bank also experienced a bank run following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). Regulators took over the bank even though it was still financially healthy at the time. One of Signature Bank’s board members argued that its downfall was a clear message from regulators saying they wanted to discourage banks from dealing with the crypto sector. Recently, several members from the crypto community have revealed that Operation Choke Point 2.0 was not just a theory. Paul Grewal, Coinbase Chief Legal Officer, disclosed in December that the company received “pause letters” through Freedom of Information Act requests. Grewal confirmed that the letters showed the FDC actively urged banks to halt or avoid crypto-related activities in 2022.

New Executive Orders Could Reshape Crypto appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Shortly after assuming the chair of the President of the United States of America, Republican leader Donald Trump, known for his pro-crypto stance, has cancelled several controversial actions taken by his predecessor, Joe Biden. Importantly, he has revoked the executive order aimed at creating a framework for AI regulation in the US, indirectly proclaiming his stance on the Web3, AI, Blockchain and Crypto sector. Meanwhile, experts like Eleanor Terrett, opine that Trump would take more aggressive actions necessary to support the futuristic sector. Let’s explore. Join! Trump’s Executive Orders: What’s Expected? Most exports, including Terrett, are confident that Trump would release an executive order announcing the creation of a cryptocurrency advisory council. Sources aware of the development suggest that the EO would create an ideal forum to bring together policymakers and business leaders. Establishing such a forum is necessary to develop feasible policies for the growth of the cryptocurrency sector, crypto enthusiasts think. CBDC Ban Speculation Terrett reveals that Trump may also issue an executive order banning the creation of a Central Bank Digital Currency. NEW: In addition to signing an executive order establishing a crypto council, #crypto policy leaders are also expecting Trump to sign an EO banning the creation of a CBDC. Unclear when exactly those EOs may be signed. https://t.co/MlpZD9AYcE — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) January 21, 2025 It was in March, 2022, that Joe Biden, the then-US president, signed the Executive Order on Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets, which discussed the possibility for the development of a United States central bank digital currency. Uncertainty Around the Timing Notably, the new administration has not yet announced any aggressive policies favouring the crypto sector, as against the general expectation that Trump would announce some pro-crypto policies within hours of his induction. Though highly optimistic about the probability for the release of some sensational EO supporting the cryptocurrency sector, Terrett admits that it is difficult to predict the exact timing of each pro-crypto EO release.

Nonetheless, an unexpected competitor has surfaced and experts refer to it as the “new XRP.” Remittix (RTX) , a low-cap altcoin, is reinventing cross-border payments and is positioned among the best crypto investment prospects available this year. Could Remittix surpass both Shiba Inu and Chainlink? Read on to find out the reasons behind investors’s close observation of this promising token. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Records a Rollercoaster Ride The Shiba Inu price showed its usual volatility as a memecoin during the past week, rising somewhat noticeably by 4% . Early in the week, traders were inspired by the Shiba Inu price chart showing a trend of higher highs and higher lows. A sharp bearish breakout, however, stopped this positive trend and brought the meme coin down to the $0.000020 level. Notwithstanding this loss, optimistic enthusiasm soon recovered and drove the Shiba Inu price above $0.000022 . This resiliency emphasizes why Shiba Inu (SHIB) stays among the promising altcoins to watch. Although the weekly trend indicated recovery, the preceding month was less fortunate with the Shiba Inu price chart showing a 6% drop. Still, community opinion of Shiba Inu (SHIB) is overwhelmingly positive since holders hope for a retest of its all-time high (ATH) of $0.000088 even though the token is now more than 75% below that top. Citing purchase signs from technical indicators like the MACD and Moving Averages, analysts also maintain an optimistic outlook for Shiba Inu (SHIB). Chainlink (LINK) Builds Bullish Momentum Rising by an amazing 38% , the Chainlink price has shown significant bullish momentum during the past week, confirming its status as among the top altcoins to keep an eye on. Strong market confidence was first inspired by the Chainlink price chart, which first showed a bullish structure of higher highs and higher lows. A sharp bearish breakout, however, sent the altcoin plunging to the $22.5 support zone momentarily. Short-lived, this dip was followed by upward momentum that drove the Chainlink price back into the $26.5 resistance zone. The altcoin’s resilience was clear even if it was rejected at this level; it gained support at $23.7 before rebounding once more to the $26.5 barrier, where it is struggling to break out from. When you zoom out, the monthly trend shows a similarly positive picture; the Chainlink price has increased by more than 9% during the past thirty days. Citing robust buy indications on the Chainlink price chart from important technical indicators such as the MACD, Momentum Oscillator, and Moving Averages, analysts anticipate further rallies. Remittix (RTX) Offers Seamless Cross-Border Payments Remittix is turning out as one of the best crypto investment options of the year as the need for perfect cross-border transactions keeps rising. Using cutting-edge technologies like the Remittix Pay API and Remittix Checkout, this creative platform effortlessly includes cryptocurrencies into worldwide payment systems.

Its attractiveness is improved by this thorough interoperability, which also helps to establish it as a leader in cross-border payment options. Driven by the growing demand for reliable and reasonably priced worldwide payment systems, analysts estimate an exponential increase for the RTX token this year. Hence, RTX is one of the best cryptos to invest in right now regardless of your level of experience with cryptocurrencies. Why Remittix Could Outshine Shiba Inu and Chainlink As Shiba Inu (SHIB) negotiates its memecoin instability and Chainlink (LINK) keeps gaining momentum, Remittix (RTX) presents a ground-floor opportunity that’s impossible to overlook with its creative ideas for flawless cross-border payments and a deflationary RTX token valued at just $0.0228 in presale.

This is a high-risk chart pattern that often leads to more downside. There are signs that the SHIB price has formed a head and shoulders chart pattern, another popular risky sign in the market. Shiba Inu is attempting to cross the key support at $0.00001960, where it has failed to drop below several times this year. The coin has also moved below the bottom of the trading range of Murrey Math Lines tool. Therefore, a drop below the key support at $0.00001958 will point to more downside, potentially to the next level at $0.000012, the ultimate support point. On the positive side, the coin has formed a small triple-bottom chart pattern at $0.000019, which may lead to a breakout if bulls defend that support. Dogecoin price forecast The DOGE price retreated this week after Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency was sued in the US. The plaintiffs argue that the appointment and the creation of the advisory board did not follow the law. The coin has continued to slowly form the bullish pennant chart pattern on the weekly chart. This pattern comprises a long vertical line in November last year, which was the flag pole. The pennant section of the pattern is formed by its ongoing consolidation. During most periods, this pattern is one of the most popular bullish chart patterns in the market. The bullish breakout usually happens when the two triangle lines are nearing their confluence levels. Therefore, the DOGE price is likely to have a strong bullish breakout. The next point to watch is its all-time high of $0.7600, which is about 122% above the current level. Pepe Coin price prediction The daily chart shows that the Pepe Coin price peaked at $0.00002837, giving it a market cap of over $10 billion. It has now dropped sharply and settled at a low of $0.0000135, which coincides with the 200-day moving average. Pepe Coin has formed a falling wedge chart pattern, which is made up of two descending and converging trendlines. The two lines are now nearing their convergence, meaning that a strong bullish breakout could happen soon. If this happens, the next point to watch will be at the all-time high of $0.00002837, which is about 90% above the current level. Dogelon Mars The Dogelon Mars price went parabolic, reaching a high of $0.000000685 on January 19 as most celebrity-themed tokens surged. It then dropped to a low of $0.0000002490 as the momentum ended. The token has crashed below the key support level at $0.00000030, its highest point in November and December last year. It remains above the 50-day moving average and the rising trendline that links the lowest swings since September. Therefore, the coin will likely remain under pressure as traders wait for the upcoming actions by the Donald Trump administration.

39248013,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=122813,1737443074,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,With Pi42 by RootstockCollective,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/with-pi42-by-rootstockcollective/,"In an exclusive interview with BitcoinWorld , we got the chance to speak with Sascha Goetz, Founder of the RootstockCollective What inspired the creation of RootstockCollective, and how does it align with the broader vision of Rootstock? RootstockCollective was established to unlock Bitcoin’s full potential beyond its role as a store of value. By addressing Bitcoin’s untapped liquidity, it ensures fair value capture for builders while rewarding the backers and stakers who support these projects within the Rootstock ecosystem. RootstockCollective’s mission aligns with the larger goal of expanding the Bitcoin ecosystem, fostering innovation, and encouraging more projects to build on Rootstock, thereby broadening the range of Bitcoin-based products available. Since the launch in September 2024, what has been the most surprising outcome or achievement for RootstockCollective? The initial community response to the RootstockCollective exceeded our expectations, with 4.5 million RIF staked in the DAO within 24 hours. More broadly, the RootstockCollective has successfully supported several builder projects in just over three months – a remarkable achievement in such a short timeframe. Take the Asami Club, for instance. This project focuses on social empowerment, offering cross-sponsoring and revenue opportunities via social media. Although their initial project didn’t work out with RootstockLabs, they secured grant funding through the DAO. Today, they actively engage with their community and champion the DAO’s potential, showcasing its value as ambassadors. Another notable project is Memora, a blockchain-based time capsule that integrates smart contracts for significant life events. In a somewhat macabre but practical example, users can set up contracts tied to their passing, enabling the transfer of crypto assets post-mortem. As a winner at the ETH Global Hackathon in Singapore, Memora utilized DAO grants to advance their project. These examples underline how RootstockCollective supports builders not just at the inception of their projects but also as they scale and grow, demonstrating the DAO’s ability to empower innovation within the Rootstock ecosystem. How does the RIF token governance system work in practice, and how do you ensure inclusivity and fairness for participants? Participation within the RootstockCollective is straightforward. One RIF token equals one vote, with a minimum of one token required to participate as a backer. Builders need at least 1,000 RIF to submit a proposal, ensuring serious applications and preventing spam. Transparency is a core principle of the Rootstock Collective, allowing anyone to track project progress within the DAO. A minimum of 4% community turnout is required for projects to receive funding, ensuring equitable participation. While liquidity differences among backers present challenges, solutions such as a delegate system are being explored to empower those with smaller contributions. The DAO remains committed to inclusivity and fairness, and we are doing all we can behind the scenes to ensure this remains the case. With $10 million in funding secured for the foundation’s treasury, what are your key priorities for allocation? The DAO’s $10 million first-year funding primarily supports builders through Builder Rewards and grants, while rewarding backers through Backer Rewards. Additional initiatives include funding hackathon participants and offering community incentives like airdrops and quest campaigns. On top the DAO treasury receives 19% of all Rootstock transaction fees soon, creating a sustainable funding cycle. Through this approach we aim to foster innovation while rewarding community involvement. What strategies are being used to engage and grow the Rootstock community further? Rootstock’s community comprises both builders and end-users. For builders, Rootstock’s unique status as the only Bitcoin Layer 2 offering Ethereum-like capabilities makes it highly appealing. The platform’s support for hackathons and workshops has attracted global interest, as demonstrated by events like the ETH Global hackathons, where we’ve experienced a huge increase in projects developing on Rootstock throughout the year. For end-users, often Bitcoin investors, there are some unique challenges to community growth. These users prioritize assurances about security audits and governance, seeking confidence that their assets are safe within the Rootstock ecosystem. Additionally, because they are less developer-focused, significant effort is directed toward raising awareness through social media and events. These initiatives are key to lowering Rootstock’s, and crypto’s barrier to entry, fostering inclusivity, and making the ecosystem accessible to newcomers. What initiatives or incentives do you offer to encourage participation and reward active members of the DAO? The CollectiveRewards program, launched in December 2024, addresses Bitcoin’s value capture problem. It works by asking the builders, who are seeking finance through the treasury, to designate a portion of their requested funds from the treasury to be given back to the backers. For example, if a project requests $5,000 in funding and allocates 50% to backers, $2,500 will be distributed among those who staked RIF voted for the project, proportionally split among voters. This approach encourages active engagement within the DAO, while ensuring all successful participants can profit – not just the builders. Looking ahead, we have exciting plans in the pipeline for further incentives, including introducing new roles for active DAO members, gamification elements, and NFT-based rewards. I don’t want to say too much right now however, just know that we are always thinking of ways to incentivize and grow the community within the DAO and plan to add more of these over this new year. As the first Bitcoin DAO to feature a Grants program, what challenges did you face in implementing it? Building the RootstockCollective involved extensive testing to ensure its mechanics were robust and effective. While balancing funding and participation equality remains a challenge, the DAO’s iterative development process allows us to address and refine based on community feedback. We’ve done this already, with the initial community feedback at launch leading to updates like the CollectiveRewards program. These improvements are all steps toward aligning the DAO with its long-term vision. We’re incredibly proud of how the DAO has evolved since launch. Already, we’ve hit double digits for positive proposals and grants handed out, and we’ve had a lot of requests from builders who want to submit proposals through the DAO. Depending on how voting goes for them, those numbers will only increase. As that happens, we’ll continue to improve and update the RootstockCollective ensuring it becomes even more effective and user-friendly. RootstockCollective staked $550,000 within the first 24 hours and has now reached $800,000. What drove this rapid adoption, and what’s next for encouraging further staking? Rootstock has been a trusted name for over seven years as the longest-standing Bitcoin Layer 2, which meant we already had quite a well-established community when we announced the DAO. This existing trust and enthusiasm played a significant role in giving RootstockCollective the strong start it enjoyed, with many users eager to dive in from the beginning. To ensure the RootstockCollective grows, we’ve been quite vocal in our messaging through social media and Telegram, getting across what the collective can offer to users who are active within the Rootstock community. Right now, the DAO is in its infancy but activity is high. Now, it’s essential we maintain this level of activity to ensure the long-term success of the project. What unique contributions do you see RootstockCollective making to the future of blockchain technology? The RootstockCollective is seeing many talented builders who are putting forth innovative project ideas for dApps. I’m sure as we keep going forward, many of these projects will become more disruptive to the usual order of things and may help advance blockchain technology as a whole. When that happens, the RootstockCollective will be there to support them. The most interesting area where the DAO may contribute to the future of blockchain technology is in the decentralization and governance process. Decentralization is a founding principle of Bitcoin and a core part of the blockchain. We are seeing many dApps appear on other chains that are taking a centralized approach, but with the RootstockCollective we are pushing for all projects to follow the decentralized bathway, growing the ecosystem and encouraging innovation. What were the most significant challenges in launching RootstockCollective, and how were they addressed? Projects like this take time and financial investment. At the start, it was a little difficult to completely visualize how we could put our theory into practice. We had to set-up the framework for the program: its structure, how it will look and the mechanics behind the scenes. Moreover,we needed that market validation from the community, which is hard to get until the project launches. We had to perform rigorous tests and market research to make sure all its features were things the community actually wanted. In many ways, our initial launch last September felt like a pilot. It wasn’t until we gathered feedback from the community – learning what worked as intended and what needed adjustment – that we could refine the DAO to better align with our vision. This milestone was reached with the launch of the CollectiveRewards programme in December, marking a significant step forward in the RootstockCollective’s evolution. What advice would you give to others building DAOs on Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions? Successful DAOs require a clear mission that is aligned with the Bitcoin community’s ethos. Transparency and community trust are crucial, as is ensuring the project genuinely embodies DAO principles. Sustaining a DAO demands long-term commitment, continuous updates, and active community engagement. RootstockCollective exemplifies how a DAO can thrive as a community-driven project, fostering innovation and collaboration within the Bitcoin ecosystem.

Will Bitcoin Soar or Suffer?,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/01/21/u-s-to-hit-debt-ceiling-on-tuesday-will-bitcoin-soar-or-suffer,"Some issues never truly go away, and the U.S. debt ceiling, which limits the maximum amount the government can borrow, is one of them. It's back in the spotlight, but past experience suggests it could be positive for bitcoin (BTC) and risk assets in general. The U.S. will hit its roughly $36 trillion debt limit on Tuesday, meaning it cannot borrow more from the public to fund its operations. ""The debt limit does not authorize new spending, but it creates a risk that the federal government might not be able to finance its existing legal obligations that Congresses and Presidents of both parties have made in the past,"" outgoing Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in an official announcement on Friday. The very thought of the world's largest economy unable to borrow more might scare investors, but note that a default and government shutdown won't happen immediately. Yellen has said that the Treasury will implement ""extraordinary measures"" from Tuesday, buying time at least till March 14. One potential measure could be running down the Treasury General Account (TGA), the government's operating account at the Fed used to collect taxes, customs duties, proceeds from the sale of securities, and public debt receipts while facilitating government payments. The previous debt ceiling episode of early 2023 , which involved using TGA to meet expenses, positively impacted risk assets, including bitcoin. That's because when the government spends the TGA balance, the cash goes to bank accounts of various entities, like contractors, employers and others, at commercial banks. That boosts the amount of reserves held by commercial banks. With more reserves, they have a better capacity to lend money, potentially increasing lending or investment in the broader economy and financial markets. As of Monday, the balance of the Treasury General Account was $677 billion. The chart illustrates Bitcoin's price alongside changes in the Treasury General Account (TGA) balance over the past five years. Notably, drawdowns in the TGA have frequently coincided with bitcoin bull runs, suggesting the inverse correlation between the two.",Markets|Bitcoin|Debt ceiling|Markets,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-21 07:12:05

The move sets the stage for a push toward $4.40, based on Fibonacci extension levels. XRP Price Eyes $4.40 According to the two‐hour Binance chart provided, XRP initially rallied from roughly $2.3374 on January 13 to a local high of $3.3509 by January 17, marking a swift rise that established the so‐called flagpole. After reaching this local high at $3.3509, the price shifted into a consolidation phase, moving within a downward‐sloping channel from January 17 through January 19 and briefly dipping below the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level at $3.1021 before rebounding. The breakout above the channel’s upper boundary, which transpired around $3.20 on January 20, is seen as a classic confirmation of a bull flag. A bull flag pattern comprises two key segments: the rapid, nearly vertical ascent (flagpole) and the subsequent, more gradual consolidation (flag). When an asset’s price closes decisively above the upper trendline of the flag, traders generally interpret it as a signal that the prior uptrend is likely to resume. Related Reading: XRP Whale Binance Deposits Skyrocket: Key Holders Preparing For Profit-Taking? In this specific setup, the distance of the flagpole is measured from the swing low at $2.3374 to the swing high at $3.3509, which yields a gain of about $1.01. Analysts then add that distance to the breakout level near $3.20 to approximate a price target in the $4.20 region. Martinez’s chart, however, also includes Fibonacci extensions that provide more granular potential targets, anchored at 0% ($2.3374) and 1 ($3.3509). These extensions appear at 1.272 ($3.6958), 1.414 ($3.8889), 1.618 ($4.1863), and 1.786 ($4.4475). The analyst cites $4.40 as the primary bullish objective, aligning closely with the 1.786 extension level. Related Reading: XRP Breaks Out Of Bullish Flag Pattern – $4 Target In Sight As per Martinez’s chart, XRP traded near $3.29, hovering just below the local high at $3.3509. If the cryptocurrency can hold above the breakout zone and ultimately surpass $3.3509, the chart’s technicals suggest a potential climb toward successive extension levels in the high $3 range and ultimately toward $4.40. The significance of the $4.40 target lies in its convergence of Fibonacci analysis with the classic bull flag projected move, giving traders a clear upside marker to watch for continued momentum. While short‐term fluctuations are always possible in volatile crypto markets, the breakout from the flag consolidation has offered a notably bullish signal, contingent on XRP’s ability to maintain support around $3.20 and build enough volume to breach the $3.3509 threshold. Notably, XRP couldn’t defend the breakout. At press time, XRP fell back into the channel and traded at $3.06. Thus, XRP bulls need to step up one more time to revalidate the scenario.

Within hours of its release, $TRUMP skyrocketed into the top 20 cryptos by market cap, peaking at an astonishing $72 per token with a market cap of $14 billion. Early buyers have already seen triple-digit gains, sparking widespread FOMO among crypto enthusiasts. Just two days later, Melania Trump added fuel to the fire by announcing her own $MELANIA token . The excitement around her coin caused a 40% dip in $TRUMP as traders scrambled to invest in the new token. Despite the price correction, $TRUMP remains strong at $57.8, boasting a $111.3 billion market cap, while $MELANIA trades at $10.89 with a market cap of $1.76 billion. This Trump family meme coin blitz comes as David Sacks, Trump’s crypto czar, declares a new age of U.S. crypto innovation. With the promise of a crypto-friendly administration and skyrocketing interest in meme tokens, traders are rushing to seize these early opportunities. As we are witnessing a rising interest in the overall meme coin space, other more established meme coins are bound to take the slice of the community interest pie in the long run.

However, as more tokens are staked, the APY will decrease, making early presale participation even more valuable. Final Opportunity to Join the Flockerz Presale With only 2 days remaining, the presale offers a final chance to secure $FLOCK tokens at early-stage prices before they debut on exchanges. Early adopters also gain the added benefit of staking rewards and exclusive access to Flocktopia, positioning them for significant returns. The successful presale performance has gauged the interest of crypto analysts such as ClayBro, a prominent YouTuber with over 135K subscribers. In his recent YouTube video , ClayBro shared his bullish outlook on $FLOCK. The YouTuber actually points out that the launch of the $TRUMP token may create a positive impact on the overall crypto space, with more investors willing to diversify their portfolios. The recent success of tokens like Pepe Unchained ($PEPU) and Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) is a sign of the demand shifting towards new projects. Flockerz Token Could See Massive Gains Because Of Trump’s New Crypto! He mentions that after $FLOCK officially launches on exchanges in under a week, the token could see exponential growth. However, it is important to note that new meme tokens attract high levels of volatility, making them very high-risk investments. Those interested in purchasing $FLOCK can do so through the Flockerz website, where tokens are compatible with $ETH, $USDT, and $BNB. Alternatively, tokens can be purchased directly through the Best Wallet app – available on both Google Play and the Apple App Store . Flockerz has built a robust community, boasting over 31,000 followers on X and 6,300 Telegram members, further solidifying its credibility. For those who missed the explosive launch of $TRUMP and $MELANIA, Flockerz presents an interesting option as it combines fun with real-world utility.",Uncategorized,EN,0,0,MARKET|BUSINESS|TRADING|BNB|ETH,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-21 07:15:44

This absence has seen crypto options signaling losses for the Ether-Bitcoin Ratio, while bitcoin price saw a slight price drop. Trump Speech Skips Crypto During his inauguration , Trump spoke about bringing the country together and solving economic and border issues. However, there was no mention of cryptocurrencies or blockchain technology. This disappointed many in the crypto world who were hoping for clearer policies or even support for digital currencies. Earlier rumors that Trump might announce a strategic bitcoin reserve or pro-crypto policies turned out to be untrue. Even the GOP’s public priorities do not include cryptocurrencies, leaving the digital space in a state of confusion. Before Trump’s speech, the crypto market responded positively to the expectation that he would mention crypto, which caused Bitcoin’s price to reach an all-time high of $109,000 . However, things took a quick turn when Trump didn’t bring up crypto or digital assets further. This led to a sharp decline in crypto prices. Bitcoin Stands Strong, While ETH Struggles Perhaps data from Amberdata shed more light on the situation. It showed that Bitcoin call options, which reflect bullish sentiment, were trading at much higher prices than Ethereum call options. This indicates that investors were placing more trust in Bitcoin’s future. Risk reversals, a measure of the difference between bullish and bearish options, also revealed that Bitcoin held a 4-5 point premium over Ethereum, highlighting stronger confidence in Bitcoin compared to Ethereum. Additionally, the Ether-Bitcoin ratio, which compares the two assets’ values, dropped to a three-year low of 0.03 this week. This further confirms that Bitcoin is currently dominating the market. What’s Next for Crypto? Trump’s lack of attention to cryptocurrencies has left many wondering about his administration’s plans. With no clear direction or policies, the crypto community is left waiting. For now, Bitcoin remains the top choice for investors, while Ethereum struggles to keep up.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|ETH|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-21 07:15:51

Official memecoins of U.S. President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania are down as much as 60% in the past 24 hours amid heavy profit-taking after Monday’s inauguration. Futures tracking the two tokens have fared similarly bad for traders — with liquidation losses at nearly $70 million for those betting on higher prices. These are not thinly-traded tokens where prices are easy to shift, either. Data shows TRUMP amassed over $19 billion in volumes over a 24-hour period, while MELANIA saw $4.5 billion exchange hands. Major tokens, such as Tron's TRX and Cardano’s ADA did under $4 billion in volumes in the same period, indicative of the high interest in the Trump family-themed tokens. Overall buying volumes are stalling in line with prices on trading application Moonshot, which was among the first to offer TRUMP to retail traders. A Dune dashboard created by @Seoulcalibur.eth shows volumes have dropped from an average above $6 million on Jan.18 to Jan.19, to just over $1 million in the past 24 hours. Crypto markets expected Trump to mention the asset class in his inaugural speech — such as plans of a promised strategic bitcoin reserve — but the lack of relevant words saw BTC fall from a Monday high above $109,000 to just over $101,000 in Asian morning hours Monday. Traders remain optimistic about a pro-crypto policy in the near term, however, with a focus on Solana’s SOL tokens. “Launching $TRUMP on SOL proves to be a significant endorsement of the chain, making it plausible that the SOL ETF could gain approval much earlier than expected,” Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a Tuesday broadcast. “With increased media exposure from similar launches, retail inflows will likely come streaming in.” “The launch of Trump's memecoin appeals not only to the retail memecoin moonshot masses, but also to major institutions as it solidifies the president's pro-crypto stance. Institutional investors are on the edge of their seats, awaiting concrete pro-crypto policies that could significantly influence the future of the economy,” the firm added.",Markets,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|SOL|ADA|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-21 07:19:15

This comes after the Donald Trump inauguration ceremony, an event that was expected to boost the confidence of crypto investors. Values of all major meme coins are down, especially Solana tokens including MELANIA. Crypto Whales Dump TRUMP Meme Coin A total of two transactions have surfaced, showing transactions of either sale or transfer of TRUMP tokens. They are collectively worth $74.22 million and have happened right after the US Presidential Inauguration, where Donald Trump took oath for the second time. The first transaction, as reported by Lookonchain through an X post , highlighted that a wallet named Ansem sold 194,799 TRUMP tokens worth approximately $6.83 million. Source: Lookonchain, X Ansem had spent 9.38 million USDC to buy these tokens at $48.14. The wallet has sold them at 35.04 thereby, losing around $2.55 million. Another transaction, as reported by Whale Alert, highlighted that an unknown wallet transferred 1,621,351 TRUMP meme coins worth almost $67,392,467 to another unknown wallet. This has sparked speculation that more sell-offs could be on the way as the value of the TRUMP token continues to plunge sharply. Source: Whale Alert Simultaneously, the speculation further soared as the TRUMP meme coin noted a decline of over 40% in the last 24 hours. Notably, the meme coin has been on the investors’ radar lately, with Coinbase announcing support for TRUMP under the experimental category. Solana Meme Coins Plunge All major Solana meme tokens have plunged in the last 24 hours. This includes the likes of BONK and WIF, with both down by 1.7% and 5.4%, listed at $0.00002911 and $1.37, respectively. MELANIA is also down by 62.7%, exchanging hands at $4.13, followed by MEW which has lost 7.1% of its value during the same time window. A decline in values across the Solana meme coin segment comes amid reports that Cuba may have sparked a pump-and-dump scheme . Investor scrutiny began when Cuba rug-pulled $158 million in 24 hours, during which it also recorded a market cap of $30 million. Nevertheless, Coingecko is showing signals to buy the dips in BONK and WIF, with investors expected to adopt the same approach for TRUMP meme coins as well. Sentiments Across Meme Coin Segment All the major meme coins are down despite TRUMP gaining over 440% since its launch. CoinMarketCap shows that the value of DOGE, the leading meme coin in terms of market cap, has lost 6.62% over the past day and is now listed at $0.3409. Notably, the decline in DOGE price is accompanied by a fall of around 9% in SHIB price. The inauguration ceremony of Donald Trump as the 47th US President has concluded, and he has expressed his resolve to sign major executive orders including the one related to cryptocurrencies. It now remains to be seen how long the ongoing sentiments last for the TRUMP meme coin and others on the list.

Despite the letdown, BTC closed the day on a positive note on Monday with a near-1% gain. However, Bitcoin price today is down No data found for bitcoin on 37 minutes ago%, while investors wonder if this descent could trigger another crash that pushes BTC under $100K. Will Bitcoin Crash Under $100K Again? Yes, Bitcoin price could crash under $100K if Donald Trump, the 47th president of the United States, or his administration does not make any crypto-related announcements. At least, this is the sentiment of the crypt markets. When Trump ended the ceremony without any crypto-related announcements, the recently launched meme coin TRUMP dropped 40% in the next eight hours. Bitcoin also dropped nearly 7% in roughly 8 hours, causing a broader crypto market correction. Key Crypto Announcements to Expect From US President Donald Trump Here are two key announcements that crypto markets can expect today, on January 21. The highly anticipated pardon of Silk Road’s Ross Ulbricht . Setting up a strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Instead of these announcements, the crypto market received notifications of crypto purchases made by Trump’s World Liberty Financial. The company acquired the following crypto tokens: $47 million worth of Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) $47 million of Ethereum $4.7 million worth of Aave (AAVE) $4.7 million worth of TRON (TRX) $4.7 million worth of Chainlink (LINK) MicroStrategy Might Steal Headlines With its Bitcoin Purchase Plan Regardless of what happens, investors need to note that long-term investors are waiting for Bitcoin to drop under $100K to buy BTC at a discount. Saylor’s MicroStrategy could make headlines again as it plans to increase authorized shares to support its Bitcoin purchasing strategy. The key focus of this vote will include the approval of increasing authorized Class A common stock to facilitate the purchase of BTC. MicroStrategy plans to increase the Class A common stock from 330 million to 10.3 billion and to increase authorized preferred shares from 5 million to 1 billion. Moreover, MicroStartegy’s Michael Saylor posted the portfolio tracker graph again, hinting at another purchase. Typically, these charts precede MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin purchase announcements.

As a result, BTC price today trades at No data found for bitcoin on 37 minutes ago after dropping No data found for bitcoin on 37 minutes ago% in the past 24 hours. Despite this minor retracement, BTC is up 0.53% this week and is still above the $100K psychological support level. *bitcoin price updated as of No data found for bitcoin on 37 minutes ago Bitcoin Technical Analysis The four-hour chart shows Bitcoin prize is bouncing off the value area high of $100,614. Roughly 68% of the volume was traded between the $93,181 and $100,614 range in the past two months. As long as this level holds above the upper limit of this range, investors can expect the bullish outlook to continue. Additionally, the market structure is also bullish on the mid-t0-higher time frame, indicating that the trend still favors buyers. Hence, a bounce off the $100K support level should catalyze a price rally to the current ATH of $109,237. Beyond this, if the buying pressure remains strong, the next key level to book profit include the 161.8% Fibonacci extension at $12,362. BTC/USDT 4-hour chart All in all, the outlook for BTC remains massively bullish, with Bitcoin price prediction forecasting a new ATH if the $100K support level holds. Any dips below $100K will likely be short-lived and could trigger a massive buying spree, pushing the crypto above this critical level. With the first pro-crypto president, the crypto market will likely kickstart a long bull run where Bitcoin and altcoin reach new highs.

Crypto venture capitalist Will Clemente commented , “What’s more likely is that they haven’t prioritized infrastructure build-out for Solana, maybe in part because they’re not incentivized to do so with a competing on-chain platform (Base).” Others shared screenshots of waiting times of hours for pending transactions, with one user asking, “Where are my coins?” before claiming to be down nearly $1,000, “patiently waiting for my Solana,” adding, “Literally never using your platform again. Moving to Gemini.” On Jan. 21, Coinbase announced support for the recently launched Official Trump ( TRUMP ) meme coin on the Solana network as a SPL token. Coinbase will add support for Official Trump (TRUMP) on the Solana network (SPL token). Do not send this asset over other networks or your funds may be lost. Transfers for this asset are available on @Coinbase & @CoinbaseExch in the regions where trading is supported. — Coinbase Assets ️ (@CoinbaseAssets) January 20, 2025 It is not the first time Coinbase has failed under heavy demand, and the exchange is known for going offline or having ‘technical issues’ when markets are at peak volatility. The Solana network has also had more than its fair share of outages over the past few years. SOL Price Slumps The rush to remove Solana and cash out has been exacerbated by the token tanking by around 13% over the past few hours. SOL prices hit an intraday high of $272 on Monday but dumped to $234 during the Tuesday morning Asian trading session. Additionally, the asset is also down almost 20% from its all-time high of $293 on Jan. 19. Solana-based and other meme coins are also getting mauled today. TRUMP has tanked more than 20%, while MELANIA has slumped around 50% over the past 24 hours. Other memes, such as Fartcoin, Dogwifhat, Mog Coin, and Freysa AI, are also deep in the red.

What could this mean for the crypto market? On Jan 19, the number of global weekly searches for “How to buy crypto” on Google have hit the 100 mark, leaping four times compared to last week’s number and is projected to go even higher as the week unfolds. The next day, Donald Trump was officially sworn in as President of the United States of America. His presidential term is poised to be much more crypto-friendly compared to the previous Biden administration. Many leaders of leading crypto firms have voiced their confidence in Trump’s administration and its potential to usher in an era of regulations that will benefit the crypto market. The number of “How to buy crypto” searches surpassed the search engine’s previously recorded all-time high, which was 38 during the week of Dec. 1 until Dec. 7, 2024.

A boost in “How to buy crypto” searches on a global scale could indicate that more people, specifically first-time buyers, are interested in delving into the crypto market. These people may have never purchased crypto before and could be interested now due to recent events, such as Trump’s pro-crypto presidency or the price of Bitcoin spiking. At this point, the two events have been inexplicably intertwined, as the previous Bitcoin rally that sparked its $100,000 surge was also prompted by Donald Trump’s win in the U.S. presidential election. Aside from America, countries like the United Arab Emirates, Singapore, Hong Kong, Thailand and more have expressed outward interest in expanding themselves into digital asset hubs so that they can keep up with the rapid growth of the crypto industry worldwide.

During his presidential campaign last year in May, Trump made a similar promise to the industry and now is the time to walk the talk. Besides, demand for Trump to sign an executive order for a strategic Bitcoin reserve is growing. Donald Trump to Sign Executive Order Banning US CBDC Digital Dollar? Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terret has reported that President Donald Trump is anticipated to sign two significant executive orders related to cryptocurrency. One order is expected to establish a dedicated crypto council, while the other would ban the creation of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). As per reports, the Crypto Council will be meeting this Thursday where the crypto industry can expect some big decisions coming. Terret mentioned that details regarding the executive orders remain unclear, however, the potential actions have sparked widespread interest and speculation within the crypto community. In his support for Bitcoin last year, Donald Trump also stated that he would never allow the creation of a US CBDC. On the other hand, there’s been a strong push for building a strategic Bitcoin reserve. On several occasions, the President has said that Bitcoin as a reserve asset will help to reduce the humongous $36 trillion US National Debt as of date. What to Expect in the Trump Era? While many from the crypto industry expected Donald Trump to issue crypto executive orders on Day 1, this hasn’t materialized so far. The industry is curious to know whether Trump would keep his promises for the crypto industry and walk the talk. Here are a few market expectations in the first 100 days at the office. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Instead of US CBDC Having a strategic Bitcoin reserve has been among the top priority for the industry with Donald Trump himself praising the asset class. Top industry leaders like Michael Saylors and crypto exchange Coinbase have extended support for the same. Now, the industry is waiting for an executive order for the same, with Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis being an ardent proponent of it. Other leaders have also opposed the idea of having a US CBDC or a USA coin for that sake. Don’t get distracted by shiny objects. Strategic. Bitcoin. Reserve. Washington is a swampy place. Decentralize the savings. #BitcoinAct pic.twitter.com/M3sMhRxewT — Cynthia Lummis (@CynthiaMLummis) January 20, 2025 White House Crypto Council The Trump administration is likely to establish a presidential crypto council comprising approximately 20 key figures from the cryptocurrency industry. The council, expected to include prominent CEOs and founders, will provide policy guidance. Besides, it will advise on digital asset issues, and help shape the administration’s approach to crypto regulation during Trump’s era. For a crypto-friendly regulatory environment, Trump has already appointed David Sacks as the White House’s crypto czar. Reports also suggest that Trump will allow US Banks to offer crypto trading services along with the SEC leadership repealing the controversial Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121) rule. Pardon Silk Road Founder Ross Ulbricht During the Presidential campaign last year in May, Donald Trump stated that he would commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht, the founder of Silk Road, on his first day in office. Although there’s no word from the Trump team regarding this, insiders say that Trump will pardon Ulbricht’s sentence within the first 24-48 hours.

A Polymarket contract asking who Trump will pardon in his first 100 days in office shot up to 99% after posts on X from Elon Musk, and Angela McArdle, chair of the Libertarian National Committee, said that a pardon for Ulbricht was in the works. Trump first promised to pardon Ulbricht during a campaign stop at the Libertarian National Convention last May. “If you vote for me, on Day 1, I will commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht to a sentence of time served,” Trump said during a speech last year. “He’s already served 11 years, we’re gonna get him home.” Ulbricht was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole in 2015 for his role in the operation of the Silk Road marketplace, which pioneered the use of the dark web. Supporters of Ulbricht say that his sentence was disproportionately long for the crime. Elsewhere on the Polymarket pardon list is Roger Ver, an early bitcoin investor and bitcoin cash (BCH) advocate, who was indicted for tax fraud last April , and the market is giving a 32% chance of a pardon taking place in the first 100 days. Despite crypto playing a prominent part of Trump's campaign, Polymarket bettors are only giving a 43% of a crypto executive order , regarding the use, trading, or legal status of digital assets, happening in the first week.",Policy,EN,0,0,BCH|REGULATION|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-21 07:43:52

Did Bitcoin (BTC) Reserve Plans Fail? Arthur Hayes Reveals the Truth!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/trump-disappointed-did-bitcoin-btc-reserve-plans-fail-arthur-hayes-reveals-the-truth/,"The day that has been awaited since November came yesterday and Donald Trump was sworn in and officially took office as President of the United States. While the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency world was closely following Trump's inauguration ceremony, Trump did not mention BTC and crypto at all in his first speech. This situation brought a decline to the market and question marks began to arise about the Bitcoin reserve. At this point, Arthur Hayes, who draws attention with his analysis, said that he is skeptical that Trump will create a Bitcoin reserve. Former BitMEX CEO and Maelstrom CIO Arthur Hayes predicted that President Donald Trump would not prioritize creating a Bitcoin reserve, citing other pressing financial priorities such as healthcare and defense. Hayes said Trump would put the Bitcoin reserve on the back burner due to the limited time frame before the midterm elections and competing budget demands. Hayes also noted that Trump has plenty of other things to devote his time and money to, saying: “I don't think Trump is going to try to create a Bitcoin reserve right now. Are you going to borrow money to buy Bitcoin? Or are you going to borrow money to provide healthcare for the elderly who voted you in? Or are you going to build more bombs to make the defense lobby love you? “There are many different things you can spend your money on. I don't think Trump is going to spend it on Bitcoin. As important as Bitcoin is to his brothers, there are many other interested parties who want borrowed money in their pockets.” Finally, Hayes acknowledged that the optimism in the crypto community regarding the Bitcoin reserve is overwhelming, saying, “I hope I'm wrong.” *This is not investment advice.

However, the opposite scenario is also common, making the crypto market famous for its volatility. Recently, a crypto trader, regarded as a whale due to its long holding, faced continuous market volatility and lost millionaire status in just 16 hours. How? Let’s discuss. Crypto Trader Loses Millionaire States to Memecoin Volatility After a slump, the crypto market began recovering, sending many new milestones. The expectations are even higher for the next four years, as Donald Trump is now the 47 U.S. president. More importantly, Trump launched his official memecoin. In this period of bullishness, crypto became the victim of volatility. Here, a series of trades turn the trader’s millionaire status. All this happened within 16 hours when the crypto trader known for its bets was left with misfortunes. This trader has invested heavily in Barron but gained losses only, so it sold all at the bottom. The trader spent nearly a million dollars on three trending Meme Coins to recover the losses. However, he is now left with just $40k, becoming the prime example of FOMO and misjudgments. Barron, TRUMP & Fartcoin Meme Coins Drowned The Trader More According to the PostedGo X post , a crypto whale invested in three popular meme coins, but every investment was lost. This began with TRUMP, Donald Trump’s official meme coin . It is a new market sensation with high volatility, resulting in frequent drops. The crypto trader lost to the same. After this, the trader opted for another meme cryptocurrency, Elon Hitler (Etler), which also failed. Despite having the name Elon, this meme coin had no connection to Elon Musk , but there is speculation about him launching one someday. The investor’s Etler loss pushed him to Fartcoin, which had a history of gains. However, to the investor’s bad luck, this failed again, leaving him with just $40,697 out of his $1M investment. What’s The Lesson For You? Meme coins built their image in 2024, when many, like PEPE and others, offered heavy returns. However, these returns are built on community hype and viral marketing, which does not last long, resulting in losses for late investors. The same happened with the aforementioned crypto trader, who invested when the hype declined. However, another bigger mistake was selling these coins even at a loss rather than waiting for recovery. This is why the investor lost $60k, as the person moved to the next trade, hoping to settle the loss. The crypto trading industry is a challenging sport, where various miscellaneous events affect crypto prices, so investment with proper research, risk management, and much more is needed to stay profitable in the market.

On Tuesday, the lead developer drew attention to the dog-themed meme coin on X, sharing Mark’s post highlighting why it is among one of the most prominent players across the meme crypto sector. As a result, crypto traders and investors are again bullish on one of the leading dog-themed meme coins in terms of market cap. Shiba Inu Lead Reacts On Marc Cuban’s SHIB Comment In an X post dated January 21, Mark spotlights why meme coins like SHIB and Dogecoin have worked. Particularly in the wake of the community’s long-term prospects and a sustainable way that benefits holders long term, the American billionaire lauds the Shytoshi Kusama-backed crypto project. Notably, Mark stated, “It’s why Doge, Shibu Inu and only a few others have worked. It’s about the community long term.” Further, replying to this post, Shiba Inu lead Shytoshi Kusama stated, “Oh and it’s SHIBA INU.” Kusama again posted on X , adding, “Why not align with us here at Shib,” calling out Mark. “Take a 10 minute call and see that it’s not just community but real technology that keeps us going,” he further added. Cuban Calls Out On New Meme Coins Meanwhile, it’s noteworthy that these comments on meme coins come against the backdrop of broader discussions revolving around the newly launched TRUMP token. CoinGape reported that Mark Cuban slammed TRUMP coin ‘s dynamics, undermining its credibility. Further, Cuban said in another post, “If meme coins are the way, maybe I’ll issue one. With a twist. Same terms as TRUMP.” This statement has further set off market discussions as the so-called twist will be that all revenue from sales of the token will go to the U.S. Treasury, per Cuban. Nevertheless, the saga has altogether garnered significant attention toward the Shiba Inu coin. SHIB Price Takes Heat However, despite the recent comment from the Shiba Inu lead, the leading meme coin’s price dipped today. At the time of reporting, SHIB price was down 6% intraday and is sitting at $0.00001979. The coin’s 24-hour low and high were $0.00001968 and $0.00002194, respectively. Despite Mark Cuban’s appraisal, the meme coin waned against the backdrop of the broader sector’s movement. Nevertheless, market participants continue to eye Shiba Inu optimistically against the backdrop of broader developments. CoinGape reported that lead developer Shyotshi Kusama claimed a “big week ahead” for the token’s community. This statement has sparked speculations of looming advancements for the meme token. Also, a SHIB price analysis by CoinGape revealed that the token could be hitting a new ATH, driven by soaring market optimism amid Donald Trump’s inauguration. Crypto market participants continue to monitor the meme coin for further price action shifts.

For instance, BlockDAG(BDAG) passed its $100m presale threshold for the first time in months, and POPCAT fell 7.5%. Speaking of POPCAT, POPCAT is gearing up for a big party. But it is PEPETO that’s really taking the limelight with its revolutionary tokenomics. Looking at its community backing and project roadmap, Pepeto is positioning itself as an icon in the memecoin space, while POPCAT continues to reign supreme in meme chatter. We want to discuss Popcat’s dip and rally, and how it relates to Pepeto’s success. Read on! PEPETO: Outpacing Rivals With Innovation Pepeto (PEPETO) is quickly becoming one of the main contenders in the memecoin market. The current presale, now at over $3.8 million, underscores its increasing popularity among retail investors and whales. In contrast to other memecoins that are largely hype-driven, Pepeto brings practicable value through its ecosystem. At the moment, pepeto’s price stands at $0.000000105 per token. A New Year’s Message from the God of Frogs As the New Year begins, the God of Frogs, Pepeto Himself, shares a message of triumph and faith for the loyal Pepeto Army: The Plan Unfolds: The roadmap progresses flawlessly, as foretold. Every milestone has been achieved, and the… pic.twitter.com/zCmy1bTRQY — Pepeto (@Pepetocoin) January 1, 2025 Further, pepetoSwap, the decentralized exchange, makes trading tokens easy with staking rewards of up to 385%. Pepeto’s future announcement – PepetoBridge, a cross-chain interoperability solution – reinforces Pepeto’s status as an innovative initiative. There is also the planned launch of an NFT marketplace which will allow users to mint and trade virtual collectibles. Pepeto’s meteoric rise has drawn interest as well because of its showmanship. Since January 2025, the token price has been climbing steadily due to its demand and unique selling proposition. Investors believe it will grow 50x, making it one of the year’s best buys. POPCAT’s Call-To-Arms POPCAT is planning a major rally thanks to the support of its devoted fans. Recently, a $2M whale purchase came through for the project. Despite its deflationary tokenomics and viral appeal, POPCAT continues to attract short-term returns investors. Developers are also experimenting with gamified products and partnerships to drive usage so the token can remain relevant. Why PEPETO Is Gaining Ground POPCAT is all about memes, but PEPETO merges jokes with practical applications. Pepeto’s democratic governance system, administered through the Pepeto DAO, keeps the project attuned to its investors. Staking incentives and a decentralized marketplace have made it a useful tool both for people in crypto novices and whales. With the memecoin market volatility, Pepeto is proving that memecoins aren’t only entertaining but can be valuable.

Ramaswamy’s decision to exit DOGE was announced hours after President Donald Trump officially began his second term in office, leaving Elon Musk as the sole leader of the cost-cutting advisory group. In a Jan. 21 X post , the 39-year-old entrepreneur said he was honored to support the creation of DOGE, expressing confidence in Musk and the team’s ability to “succeed in streamlining government.” Without elaborating on his future plans, Ramaswamy said he would have “more to say very soon” about his future plans, particularly in Ohio, while reaffirming his commitment to helping President Trump “make America great again.” According to people familiar with the matter, Ramaswamy, who is an Ohio native, is preparing to announce his candidacy for Ohio governor, with reports indicating he sees this as the next step in his political career. If elected, he would succeed Governor Mike DeWine, whose second and final term is set to end in January 2027 due to term limits. The Ohio gubernatorial election is scheduled for November 2026. Anna Kelly, an official from DOGE, confirmed Ramaswamy’s plans to “run for elected office” in comments to the Associated Press. According to Kelly, this required him to step away from the organization due to its “structure,” which prohibits active members from pursuing political campaigns. The development follows reports of growing tensions between Ramaswamy and Musk, with sources citing an X post by Ramaswamy in December criticizing American culture as a tipping point for the Tesla CEO.

Insiders described the situation as a culmination of “burned bridges” within Trump’s circle, hastening his departure from the advisory group. Amid this backdrop, DOGE has come under fire for revising the ambitious budget-cutting goals it set at its inception. Initially touted as a game-changing advisory group capable of slashing $2 trillion from the federal budget, the organization has faced skepticism after Musk suggested a more modest $1 trillion target as a realistic outcome. As previously reported by crypto.news, critics, including tech journalist Kara Swisher, have cited DOGE’s lack of real authority to enforce budget cuts as a key limitation, questioning its ability to achieve meaningful results.

Thousands Of Investors Race To Remittix ICO,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/solana-price-prediction-can-sol-hit-400-before-february-thousands-of-investors-race-to-remittix-ico/,"Solana has turned red, hovering near the $260 level after hitting a new all-time high of $295.83 the previous day. Per Artemis data , SOL’s DEX trading volume also hit a new high of $27 billion, bolstered by the rise of TRUMP and MELANIA meme coins in the Solana Blockchain. The technical perspective and on-chain metrics suggest a continuation of the rally as its Total Value Locked (TVL) and fees generated hit record levels. At the same time, Remittix (RTX) presale momentum has caught the eyes of investors, thanks to its practical application in a highly lucrative sector. Combining blockchain efficiency and real-world utility, Remittix is poised to capture significant market share and become a top investment opportunity like Solana. Let’s uncover why these tokens are among the top investment choices in 2025. SOL Price Eyes $400 Milestone Before February The Solana price broke above its descending trendline on January 17 and rallied by over 34% to hit a new all-time high of $295.83 on January 19. However, the rally pulled back sharply to retest its daily support of $230. This region aligns with the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of $168.88 low and high of $295.83, making it a critical reversal zone. The SOL coin has now rebounded near the $260 level. If the token continues with the upward momentum, it could extend its rally to retest its all-time high of $295.83. A successful close above this level could trigger more rallies towards the psychological level at $300. Any additional bullish momentum could push the price of Solana towards the $350 and $400 levels. Its RSI has been hovering around 69, highlighting bullish momentum. In any case, traders have remained cautious as the SOL token has entered overbought levels. The chances of a pullback could increase. Another probable scenario could be its RSI remaining above overbought levels and the SOL token continuing to rally. Recently, Solana TVL spiked from $10.11 billion to $14.24 billion in January, its highest level since its launch. This reflects growing activity and interest within the Solana ecosystem. Moreover, it generated $34.27 million in fees on January 20, a new all-time high daily, further boosting the bullish outlook. Overall, SOL crypto’s strong market performance has placed it among the top cryptocurrencies to watch in this cycle. Why Remittix (RTX) Is Among Top Investments in 2025 Remittix (RTX) is changing cross-border transactions as we know it. It deftly combines blockchain technology with traditional banking, allowing users to easily convert over 40 cryptos into fiat and deposit the money to any bank account worldwide. Unlike standard systems that charge hidden fees and lag, Remittix offers fast 24-hour transfers with an easy flat fee model. This straightforward approach appeals to individuals and businesses seeking predictable international transaction costs. Notably, BlockSAFU and SolidProof have verified Remittix’s advanced security protocols and smart contracts to ensure further transparency and build trust in the ecosystem. The project has empowered companies to adopt crypto payments through the Remittix Pay API. With this, merchants can accept crypto payments and receive settlements in their bank accounts. It supports more than 40 fiat currencies and over 50 crypto pairs. This flexibility has given businesses an edge in working efficiently across multiple markets. What is even more interesting is its focus on financial inclusivity. Remittix aims to assist the underbanked and unbanked by eliminating dependency on traditional banking infrastructure and offering access to global financial services. Its standout low-cost structure and 24/7 availability have enabled the platform to eliminate financial barriers. Notably, $RTX token holders can earn staking rewards of up to 8% APY for standard investors and up to 18% APY for Tier-3 premium members. The rewarding structure fosters loyalty and promotes long-term engagement. So far, Remittix is selling for only $0.0228, marking an over 50% leap from its starting price of $0.015. Meanwhile, it has raised over $4 million as investors continue being bullish about it. SOL Vs RTX: Which Token Could Offer Higher Short-Term Gains Solana and Remittix have shown strong investor confidence in the past few weeks. The SOL technical perspective and on-chain metrics suggest continuing the current rally. With a smaller market capitalization and higher growth potential, Remittix’s price seems ready to jump at the presale. With an expected 800% growth during presale and over 5,000% post-launch, Remittix could offer greater returns in the short term.

39249539,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=316667,1737446648,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/dailyhodl.png,"Here’s What Gives TRUMP Memecoin Its Value, According to CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju",https://dailyhodl.com/2025/01/21/heres-what-gives-trump-memecoin-its-value-according-to-cryptoquant-ceo-ki-young-ju/,"The chief executive of the digital asset analytics firm CryptoQuant is outlining what gives President Donald Trump’s newly launched memecoin value. The Official Trump ( TRUMP ) memecoin launched on Friday and rapidly surged in price to become a top-30 crypto asset by market cap. The asset is trading at $40.47 at time of writing and is down nearly 40% in the past 24 hours but up more than 518% since Friday. It already has a market cap of more than $8.1 billion. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju says retail traders think that financial markets are all about following trends and “chasing memes.” “What gives Trump’s meme coin its value? Unlike traditional securities, which pool investments for productive activities, celebrity meme coins don’t directly create value. Instead, Trump is likely to use his coin holders as a powerful community base for collective action. If you’re thinking about investing in Trump Coin, the key question is how much influence his community will gain during his presidency. The coin’s value depends entirely on what Trump does. With his fervent fan base, it’s unlikely Trump’s meme coin will ever go to zero – unless he deliberately pulls the rug.” Young Ju says a memecoin’s value depends on whether its associated community acts in ways that benefit society. “A community with goodwill could turn a meme coin into a valuable asset. But on the flip side, it would be terrifying if a cult or terrorist group used a meme coin to build a massive following.” The CryptoQuant executive also predicts that more memecoins will be launched under Trump’s administration. “The Trump administration has embraced free markets instead of regulated markets, and over the next four years, we’re likely to see all kinds of experiments with meme-driven communities in the crypto space. This wave is unstoppable – at least until 2028.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

It’s now time for savvy investors to search for altcoins that are set to deliver explosive gains. As we anticipate the next bull wave, choosing the right tokens could lead to life-changing returns. Among numerous assets, experts have picked Shiba Inu (SHIB), Ripple (XRP), and DTX Exchange (DTX) as standout contenders this January. They believe these altcoins hold immense potential and can offer massive investment returns. Today’s article considers their fundamentals and growing utility, which make these altcoins the top picks. Ripple (XRP) Is Poised For Massive Gains in 2025 Ripple is a top coin that could deliver nice returns soon. For the first time since 2018, the XRP price reached $3.40. Patient investors have enjoyed over 600% gains since its breakout in November 2024. Interestingly, there’s growing speculation about the XRP spot ETF, which could increase investor interest. Despite ongoing regulatory hurdles, Ripple’s past legal victories have reinforced investor confidence. This is evident in over 100,000 users holding at least $100k worth of XRP tokens. In the past week alone, XRP gained over 26% , driven by large-scale investor activity. While top technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index suggest overbought conditions, experts are optimistic that Ripple will deliver more gains soon. This makes it a top asset to watch out for this month. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Might Breakout in January 2025 Another altcoin this January 2025 is Shiba Inu. This asset finds itself at a critical junction as bulls and bears affect its price. Interestingly, on-chain data reveals changes in investor behavior, which signals a potential shift in the token’s price growth. Reports noted that large wallets holding over 77 trillion SHIB are redistributing their tokens in preparation for the next market cycle. Also, smaller wallets containing 1-10 billion SHIB are increasing. This proves that SHIB continues to attract newer investors. However, recent price action may paint a challenging situation. SHIB dropped about 5% in the past week to $0.000022, and technical indicators hint at potential downside risks. Still, savvy investors believe this price could be a potential buy zone before it rebounds soon. DTX Exchange (DTX) Reshapes The Trading Market with its Hybrid Approach Lastly, we have DTX Exchange , a viral altcoin set to transform the online trading space with its hybrid approach. It seamlessly combines the strengths of centralized and decentralized exchanges on a secure platform. Thus, it offers access to hundreds of financial assets — from stocks and forex to cryptos and ETFs. This makes DTX Exchange the first crypto-native platform to deliver comprehensive asset management in a single hub. Additionally, the VulcanX blockchain powers DTX Exchange. It delivers ultra-fast speeds and reliable functionality. Its testnet data reveals that this chain could process over 200,000 transactions per second (TPS) and execute trades in just 0.04 seconds. This speed, coupled with the platform’s 1,000x leverage, allows traders to turn modest investments into higher liquidity. Furthermore, DTX Exchange prioritizes security and user control by offering non-custodial storage and wallet-based trading. These features ensure users retain full ownership of their assets. Unlike traditional exchanges, DTX Exchange creates a transparent and safe trading environment that inspires trust and confidence. For investors, DTX’s current seventh presale round could be a sweet spot to enter. The DTX token, priced at just $0.14, gives users a chance to secure substantial returns before its official listing on crypto exchanges. With this unique blend of performance and versatility, analysts hail DTX as the best altcoin to invest in right now. Wrapping Up Ripple (XRP), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and DTX Exchange (DTX) present incredible opportunities for investors looking to unlock life-changing gains. While SHIB and XRP show strong potential for recovery, DTX Exchange stands out as a frontrunner, thanks to its vast asset offerings, lightning-fast transaction speeds, and innovative Phoenix Wallet. The DTX token is currently in its presale stage and is already seeing massive demand. For traders eager to ride the next big wave, this is the right moment to secure significant returns.

39252038,https://timestabloid.com/?p=55107,1737450063,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Breaking: SEC Gets New Boss. New Hope For Ripple and XRP,https://timestabloid.com/breaking-sec-gets-new-boss/,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) are undergoing significant leadership transitions, potentially signaling a shift in regulatory strategies for the cryptocurrency industry. These changes come amidst growing calls for clearer rules and a more collaborative approach to addressing the unique challenges posed by digital assets. Mark Uyeda Named Acting SEC Chairman Republican Commissioner Mark Uyeda has been appointed acting chairman of the SEC, following the end of Gary Gensler’s term. Uyeda steps into this role as the agency faces criticism for its aggressive enforcement actions under Gensler’s leadership. Known for his vocal opposition to the SEC’s “regulation through enforcement” approach, Uyeda has described it as a “disaster” for the cryptocurrency sector. While Uyeda assumes the interim role, Paul Atkins, CEO of Patomak Global Partners, remains the nominee to replace Gensler. Atkins, a former SEC commissioner with a history of supporting market-friendly regulations, awaits Senate confirmation. Uyeda was previously seen as a strong contender for the permanent chairmanship, raising speculation about the direction the SEC might take during his tenure as acting chair. CFTC Leadership: Caroline Pham Takes the Helm In a parallel development, Commissioner Caroline Pham has been selected to serve as the acting chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) , according to Bloomberg. Pham is well-regarded for her forward-thinking stance on cryptocurrency regulation, particularly her advocacy for “regulatory sandboxes.” These frameworks allow emerging crypto firms to test their products and services under limited regulatory oversight, fostering innovation while ensuring consumer protection. Pham has consistently pushed for clear policies to guide the rapidly evolving crypto industry, emphasizing the need for tailored approaches that address its complexities. Her appointment aligns with the CFTC’s historical emphasis on fostering innovation while maintaining robust oversight. Candidates for Permanent Leadership Roles Both agencies are on track to select permanent chairs, and the choices could shape the future of cryptocurrency regulation in the U.S. At the SEC, Paul Atkins awaits confirmation, while Pham is a leading contender for the CFTC top job. Another frontrunner at the CFTC is Brian Quintenz, the current head of crypto policy at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. Quintenz, a former CFTC commissioner, has long advocated for regulatory frameworks that accommodate innovation without stifling growth. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A Potential Shift in Regulatory Strategy The leadership transitions come at a critical time for the cryptocurrency industry, which has struggled under the weight of unclear and often punitive regulatory actions. The SEC, under Gensler , adopted a hardline approach, pursuing numerous enforcement actions against crypto companies for alleged violations. However, recent reports suggest that a Republican-led SEC may consider freezing or dropping non-fraud cases, signaling a possible pivot toward a more measured strategy. Similarly, Pham’s leadership at the CFTC could bring a collaborative and innovation-friendly approach to regulation. Her emphasis on sandboxes and transparent policies reflects a broader recognition of balancing oversight with the potential benefits of blockchain technology and digital assets. Implications for Ripple and Crypto Industry The dual leadership transitions at the SEC and CFTC have raised hopes for a more constructive regulatory environment. With Uyeda and Pham at the helm, the focus may shift toward fostering innovation while addressing legitimate issues concerning fraud and investor protection. In December, Uyeda suggested that the SEC might ease its enforcement actions in non-fraud cases while providing greater regulatory clarity for digital asset firms. His remarks were promising signals to the crypto industry, especially for Ripple and XRP, which have endured years of legal battle with the regulatory agency. With Uyeda now at the helm of affairs, an end to Ripple case is highly anticipated. As the agencies navigate these transitions, the industry will watch closely to see how interim leaders shape policy and influence the broader regulatory landscape. Whether these changes represent a temporary shift or the beginning of a long-term transformation depends on the individuals selected for permanent leadership roles. For now, the appointments of Uyeda and Pham provide a glimpse of potential progress in bridging the gap between regulators and the crypto industry.

Which One Of These Will Make The Highest Returns For Investors And Why",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/pepe-shiba-inu-or-remittix-in-2025-which-one-of-these-will-make-the-highest-returns-for-investors-and-why/,"The crypto market is full of new opportunities, especially with the ongoing bull run set for another massive pump. Analysts have chosen PEPE, Shiba Inu and fast rising Remittix ($RTX) as the best altcoins that could offer the highest returns for investors. With innovative blockchain powered solutions for cross-border payments, a new rival, Remittix (RTX) is gently transforming the financial scene. Many analysts consider it the best crypto to buy now for huge gains. . Top Altcoins Prediction: PEPE Is Poised For Explosive Growth In April to May 2023, PEPE surged, reaching a market cap of $1.6 billion, creating millionaires from early investors. This fueled interest in memecoins, sparking significant price movements in the market. Like the other best cheap cryptocurrencies, Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, PEPE captured attention with its no tax policy and straightforward approach. The roadmap outlines three phases aimed at increasing visibility and listings on major exchanges, with a focus on Twitter trends and a so-called “meme takeover.” The long-term potential remains a point of interest for enthusiasts. As a result, many investors consider PEPE to be one of top altcoins to buy now. Analysts See Huge Returns On Shiba Inu (SHIB) SHIB closed the year with a solid 104% year on year price rise in 2024 after massive upside surges. Beginning 2024 at roughly $0.000010, the meme coin crossed $0.00002 by December. Past performances of Shiba Inu’s SHIB reveal an intriguing narrative. Except for 2022, when it lost 75.8%, most years have ended well with upside trends. While this upward trend may not be flawless, it demonstrates the Shiba Inu token’s ability to recover and expand, even following an 80% correction. The Shiba Inu’s SHIB’s staying above $0.00002 at the end of every year suggests this becoming the new baseline for the cryptocurrency value. According to analysts’ prediction, Shiba Inu will rank among the top altcoins during the 2025 bull run. Remittix Set For a Massive Surge From their 2017 worth of roughly $150 trillion to $250 trillion by 2027, cross-border payments under creative swap-in exchange are estimated to have grown significantly. By fusing the strength of blockchain technology with conventional banking systems, Remittix is gaining market share in this enormous industry and developing a smooth and effective solution for international transactions. Remittix allows customers to exchange more than 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat money swiftly. Then, these monies may be sent straight to any bank account worldwide. Remittix stands out for its simplicity. Recipients receive a usual bank transfer, unaware that it began as a cryptocurrency payment. Thanks to its innovative features, users can handle their funds with total autonomy and flexibility. The platform targets prominent rivals such as Coinbase, Wise and Stripe. However, unlike these traditional competitors, Remittix has the unique capability of sending money via cryptocurrency, converting it and depositing it immediately into a bank account. Businesses may now accept cryptocurrency payments from clients and process fiat transactions to a specified bank account thanks to Remittix’s Pay API. Companies may also set up merchant accounts, which give them complete control over how they pay out their cryptocurrency and provide them access to more than 50 cryptocurrency pairings and more than 30 fiat currencies. Remittix (RTX) is seeing a sharp increase in investor interest. The enthusiasm is evident with tokens priced at only $0.0228 and over $4 million raised in the $RTX presale. Experts in the market predict a stunning 5,000% increase after launch and an 800% jump before the conclusion of the presale. With Remittix at the forefront, now is the perfect time to explore the possibilities of cross-border payments.

The Trump family contributed to the developments as they officially joined the meme tokens space on Monday. However, the new themed tokens have slumped over the past day, losing up to 65% of their value. Such trends have attracted discussions of utility over hype, and iDEGEN appears as the option as it combines virility and unique use cases. iDEGEN is an AI-centered crypto project that went viral over the past weeks due to its inimitability. It has witnessed massive commitment from savvy investors, with IDGN ICO raising nearly $17.5 million (so far). Let’s assess why iDEGEN might be perfect for individuals searching for lucrative long-term gems. Trump family tokens slump TRUMP (Official Trump) dominated crypto trends on Monday following explosive surges to ATHs above $70. While many expected the alt to hit $100 amidst the inauguration , massive bearishness emerged hours before the ceremony. TRUMP began plummeting after Trump’s wife launched her MELANIA meme token . The former trades at $36.80 after dropping nearly 40% of its value within the past day. MELANIA joined the bloodbath, sliding from yesterday’s peak above $13 to $4.08 at press time. Chart by Coinmarketcap The altcoin remains poised for extended losses or consolidation unless massive catalysts emerge. However, prevailing trends suggest faded interest in the latest PolitiFi coins. The crypto community has criticized the president’s family after the ‘rug pulls.” While analysts believe the inauguration doesn’t determine cryptos’ future , whales have reduced their meme exposure after the ceremony. On-chain analytics platforms have highlighted two large-scale investors and their TRUMP transactions. Whale Alert shows one investor moved TRUMP worth over $67.39 million (1.621,351 tokens). Whale Alert @whale_alert · Follow 🚨 🚨 🚨 1,621,351 #TRUMP (67,392,467 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to unknown wallet whale-alert.io/transaction/so… 12:35 am · 21 Jan 2025 318 Reply Copy link Read 28 replies The transfer happened after the president’s speech, signaling an imminent dump. Also, another player sold TRUMP coins worth about $6.83 million, 194,799 assets after Trump’s oath. Notably, the investor lost $2.55M after the transaction. The prevailing bearish wave could intensify large-scale selloffs, triggering more crashes for Trump-linked memes. iDEGEN: The unstoppable meme coin While new themed tokens fail to keep pace, iDEGEN continues to flex its muscles. The project uses AI to learn from Crypto Twitter and post on X every hour. However, its wild comments on the social site—ranging from philosophy to conspiracies— have resulted in bans as well. Meanwhile, that didn’t stop the IDGN community as investors continued to pour money into the project. X lifted the ban yesterday, which iDEGEN cheered, stating that even massive firms such as BlackRock can’t stop it. The AI experiment seems unavoidable since it’s everywhere. Besides the hype, IDGN’s roadmap highlights notable volatility, cementing the project’s long-term presence in the crypto world. Source – iDEGEN IDGN trades at $0.038 and early adopters have netted over 10,900% in profits. With its current momentum, iDEGEN looks to revolutionize the meme crypto world after its exchange debut on 27 February. You can visit IDGN’s official website for more details.

While the timing and magnitude of this move raised eyebrows, it also highlighted WLFI’s strategy to solidify its presence in the digital asset market. The acquisition, which included Ether, Wrapped Bitcoin, and other tokens, signals WLFI’s ambition to leverage crypto as a cornerstone of its financial model amidst shifting global financial dynamics.

The decision to expand its crypto portfolio aligns with WLFI’s broader financial strategy. By investing in high-liquidity assets like Ether and Bitcoin, alongside niche tokens, WLFI is positioning itself as a significant player in the DeFi landscape. This diversification also serves as a hedge against market volatility, offering stability to its $300 million treasury, which has been bolstered by successful token sales. Token sales driving financial momentum Since October 2024, WLFI has sold 20% of its token supply, raising $300 million through pre-sales. A new tranche of tokens, representing an additional 5% of the supply, was made available immediately after Trump’s inauguration. These token sales highlight the increasing appetite for decentralised financial projects, particularly those associated with high-profile figures like Trump. A significant endorsement came from Tron DAO, led by founder Justin Sun, which increased its investment in WLFI to $75 million. Sun, who joined WLFI as an advisor in November, described the partnership as a “transformative step” for both projects. H.E.

Head to BTFD for Maximum Gains,https://thecoinrise.com/top-meme-coin-presales-to-buy-today-regret-missing-out-on-bome-head-to-btfd-for-maximum-gains/,"Meme coins have taken the crypto world by storm, evolving from fun internet experiments into serious investment opportunities. Over the years, we’ve seen coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu turn casual investors into overnight success stories. Now, the next wave of meme coins is here, and two presales are making big headlines— BTFD Coin (BTFD) and Book of Meme (BOME). These coins are attracting attention not just for their meme-worthy branding but also for their innovative features and growth potential. Let’s dive into why these two are the top meme coin presales to buy today and how they compare. If you’re eyeing BOME but worried about missing out, let’s put that fear to rest. While BOME has potential, BTFD Coin’s explosive presale performance and innovative features give it the edge. With a robust ecosystem, staking rewards, and its referral program, BTFD is positioning itself as the meme coin to beat. BTFD Coin: The Game-Changer in Meme Coins BTFD Coin is making waves as one of the top meme coin presales to buy today , and it’s not hard to see why. The coin’s presale has been a massive success, raisi ng over $5.2 million and selling more than 64 billion coins to 8,400 holders. At its current Stage 13 price of $0.000142, investors have a golden opportunity to get in early before it hits its $0.0006 listing pri ce. One of BTFD’s standout features is its referral program . It’s simple—share your unique link, invite friends to join, and earn rewards when they invest. This program is a win-win, not only growing the community but also putting extra tokens in your wallet. It’s perfect for those who want to make the most of their investment while helping the project thrive. BTFD also brings something fresh to the table with its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game. This isn’t just about earning tokens; it’s about creating an immersive experience where players can have fun and build wealth simultaneously. Add to that the Bulls Squad, a tight-knit community of investors who are actively driving the project forward, and you’ve got a recipe for success. Now, let’s talk numbers. If you invest $7,500 at the current Stage 13 price, you’d snag 52,816,901 BTFD coins. When the price hits $0.0006 after the presale, your investment would balloon to an impressive $31,690. That’s the kind of return that’s hard to i gnore. Analysts are already buzzing about BTFD’s post-launch potential, predicting it could outperform many of its peers once it hits major exchanges. With its innovative features and strong presale momentum, BTFD is shaping up to be one of the most promising meme coins of 2025. Book of Meme: A Fun, Community-Driven Contender Book of Meme (BOME) is another meme coin that’s caught the crypto world’s attention. With its tongue-in-cheek branding and emphasis on community, BOME has built a loyal following. The coin’s developers have leaned into humor and creativity, making it a fun and approachable option for first-time crypto investors. BOME’s ecosystem focuses heavily on storytelling and gamification. The “Book of Meme” concept invites users to participate in a virtual world where they can earn rewards, trade NFTs, and unlock unique content. It’s a playful approach that resonates with younger audiences looking for something different. Crypto analysts predict steady growth for BOME, especially if it continues to engage its community with fresh updates and partnerships. However, compared to BTFD, it lacks some of the robust financial incentives like high staking rewards or a referral program. While BOME is a solid project, it feels more niche, catering to those who prioritize fun over long-term financial returns. Why BTFD Stands Out Among the Top Meme Coin Presales to Buy Today BTFD Coin’s presale is your chance to get in on what could be the next big thing in meme coins. Its explosive start, coupled with its innovative features, makes it a standout option for investors. Whether it’s the high APY on staking, the engaging P2E game, or the rewards-rich referral program, BTFD is ticking all the right boxes. If you’re ready to jump in, here’s how to get started. Visit the official presale page , connect your wallet (MetaMask or Trust Wallet work great), and input the amount you want to invest. Review the discounted price, hit “Buy Now,” and confirm your transaction. That’s it—you’re now part of one of the hottest crypto projects of 2025. Conclusion Based on our research, BTFD Coin and Book of Meme are two of the top meme coin presales to buy today , but BTFD takes the crown. Its explosive presale performance, innovative features, and strong community backing make it the smarter choice for long-term growth. Don’t miss out on this wealth-generation opportunity— join the BTFD Coin presale now and position yourself for potentially life-changing returns. The future of meme coins is here, and BTFD is leading the charge.

The investment manager noted that portfolios with allocations to bitcoin are consistently outperforming those that don't hold the world's largest cryptocurrency. Asset managers need to integrate the digital asset into multi-asset portfolios or ""risk falling behind in a rapidly evolving financial landscape,"" wrote analyst Dovile Silenskyte, adding that bitcoin adoption is expected to grow this year as more clients demand exposure to the asset class. The launch of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. helped take crypto more mainstream in 2024. This momentum is expected to continue this year as the regulatory environment becomes more friendly in the U.S. under President Trump, and as more countries approve exchange-traded products (ETPs) for altcoins such as solana 's SOL and XRP , WisdomTree said. ""This next wave of altcoin ETPs will expand the diversity of crypto investment opportunities and further integrate cryptocurrencies into the global financial system,"" Silenskyte wrote. The Ethereum blockchain's role as the ""backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and Web3 is unmatched,"" the report said, but its scalability issues are still a problem. Still, recent upgrades including Dencun are expected to drive layer-2 adoption on the blockchain, the report noted. Stablecoins are ""becoming indispensable to the global financial system,"" and networks such as Solana are ideal for stablecoin payments and remittances, WisdomTree said. Tokenization , the process of putting the ownership of real world assets on the blockchain, will expand dramatically in 2025, and will transform industries from private equity to venture capital, the report added.

Analysis Company Announces Short-Term Forecast!",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/trump-skipped-bitcoin-price-dropped-what-will-happen-to-bitcoin-price-next-analysis-company-announces-short-term-forecast/,"Donald Trump was sworn into office as President of the United States yesterday. However, Trump's failure to make a statement about cryptocurrencies at the inauguration ceremony and his failure to sign the expected decree on Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies caused sharp declines in the crypto market, especially Bitcoin. While some experts say that uncertainty about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies' decrees is increasing the pressure on prices, Matrixport analysts say that BTC still has significant upside potential in the short term. Cryptocurrency analysis platform Matrixport shared the January 21 chart in its analysis from the X account, saying that Bitcoin has been trading in an increasingly narrowing wedge range since mid-November of last year. Stating that higher-than-expected inflation data and the FED's hawkish stance affected market sentiment, Matrixport analysts said that in the face of these negativities, positive expectations that Trump would launch a potential Bitcoin reserve provided support to the BTC price and prevented a larger pullback. Analysts noted that Bitcoin was consolidating within the wedge range until Trump’s inauguration on January 20, indicating that this was a bullish signal for BTC. Noting that BTC is currently retesting the breakout level that coincides exactly with the upper boundary of the wedge range, Matrixport analysts emphasized that if BTC can maintain this important support level, there is still significant bullish potential in the short term. “Since mid-November, Bitcoin has been trading within a narrowing wedge. On the negative side, they include higher-than-expected inflation and a more hawkish Federal Reserve. On the positive side, optimism around President Trump potentially establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve helped maintain momentum and prevent a deeper decline. The consolidation inside the wedge continued until Trump’s inauguration and served as a catalyst for Bitcoin to make an upward breakout – a bullish signal. “Bitcoin is now retesting the breakout level corresponding to the upper boundary of the wedge. If Bitcoin holds above this key support, the short-term outlook remains very bullish, and the breakout signals renewed upward momentum.” *This is not investment advice.

Official Trump ( TRUMP ), a meme coin launched by President Donald Trump on Solana , has seen a dramatic price drop after Trump’s inauguration. In the past 24 hours, the price has tanked from $74 to just $38, sending some investors into panic mode. While it’s still unclear why the token took such a sharp dive, some link it to unrealized expectations surrounding Trump’s inauguration speech.

CANTO is a utility token linked to a permissionless layer 1 blockchain of the same name . Known for its compatibility with Ethereum Virtual Machine , Canto’s token was launched to be “completely decentralized,” without a core foundation, presale or ventures. Canto leverages Tendermint Consensus and Cosmos Software Development Kit and is secured by its own validators. Canto also uses the Ethermint system to gain EVM compatibility, which enables an EVM execution environment, further facilitating the deployment of Ethereum smart contracts. CANTO is not a governance token, claiming to enable users to engage with its offering for “free.” The Canto DEX itself claims to be ungoverned and cannot implement additional fees or launch new tokens. Therefore, the CANTO crypto is simply used to facilitate liquidity mining and staking on the Canto blockchain. In August last year, Canto reportedly had problems in producing blocks. The network had to stop block production as it was experiencing issues with its consensus mechanism, a process used by the blockchain to validate transactions.

As revealed by Scam Sniffer, the attackers take advantage of common programs which are for instance Homebrew – package manager for macOS which helps the attackers to gain trust from the users and steal wallet data. 1/7 SECURITY ALERT: Another case of malicious software distributed via Google Ads, targeting crypto users through fake Homebrew installers. Attackers are using fake ads to lure victims into downloading malware designed to steal crypto wallet data and drain assets. Here's how… https://t.co/6DEC0XnrjC pic.twitter.com/vfuKCsECo2 — Scam Sniffer | Web3 Anti-Scam (@realScamSniffer) January 20, 2025 How The Attack Works Phishers use identical Google links whereby they design fake Google Ads looking like normal promotion for Homebrew installers. When the user clicks these ads, he is diverted to the fake homepages that are similar to the official Homebrew home page. Once there, users download a malicious program and not the genuine software. Once executed, the malware specifically targets crypto users by Stealing browser data like Cookies, passwords, and extensions, harvesting crypto wallet files from Electrum, Exodus, Atomic Wallet, and Ledger Live, and inducing users to enter their system password. The malware also collects system info, keychain data, and Telegram files. The final aim is to steal victims’ money and transferring to the attacker owned accounts Why These Attacks Are Concerning Google Ads make such scams more legitimate and people are more likely to fall into them than in other scams that do not incorporate Google Ads. Thieves are taking advantage of users’ confidence in the popular social platforms and instruments to distribute their viruses. As these attacks grow more advanced, crypto users must take proactive steps to protect themselves: Avoid clicking on ads: As much as possible, go straight to the specific site rather than being led there by search engine ads. Verify URLs carefully: Be sure that it is the official website you entered and not a fake or look-alike website which could deceive and rip you off.

On January 21, Analog will kick off the launch of its $ANLOG token through a Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP) on Fjord Foundry. The event marks a significant step in Analog’s journey to establish a fully interoperable blockchain ecosystem. Running for 48 hours, the LBP aims to foster community-driven price discovery and equitable token access, reflecting Analog’s commitment to building open and decentralized infrastructure. Tokens purchased via the LBP will be fully unlocked in time for the forthcoming Token Generation Event (TGE). The $ANLOG LBP will be live on Fjord Foundry from January 21, 2025, 06:00 AM CET and run until January 23, 2025, 05:59 AM CET. $ANLOG Equal Access Through LBP LBPs, which have gained traction as a fair token distribution mechanism, utilize a dynamic pricing structure that adjusts based on participant demand. This approach contrasts with traditional token launches, where fixed prices often benefit larger, early participants at the expense of smaller contributors. By leveraging Fjord Foundry’s infrastructure, Analog will ensure that $ANLOG’s distribution is as broad as possible, which is ideal when launching a new token or network. For Analog, the choice to host its $ANLOG sale via an LBP on Fjord Foundry was an obvious one. LBPs are uniquely designed to democratize access to tokens by enabling prices to start high and decrease gradually over time until they stabilize based on market demand. This model ensures that contributors set the token’s valuation, avoiding the speculative surges often associated with conventional launches. Fjord Foundry’s community-focused token sale platform has supported a string of successful projects through its LBP framework. Its infrastructure aligns seamlessly with Analog’s goal of building an ecosystem that prioritizes accessibility and fairness for developers and end-users alike. Having recently closed a $5M seed round, taking its total funding to $21M, Analog is now well on course to achieve its goal of providing the interoperable layer to connect all major blockchains. $ANLOG in Action The $ANLOG token is central to Analog’s Layer 0 protocol that facilitates seamless cross-chain data and transaction flows. Analog’s flagship innovation, Timechain, enables decentralized applications to securely operate across multiple blockchains. This ensures developers are not siloed within a single network but can build solutions that transcend traditional boundaries. $ANLOG acts as the utility token within this ecosystem, empowering developers to interact with Analog’s cross-chain infrastructure. From paying transaction fees to incentivizing validator participation, $ANLOG is a cornerstone of Analog’s drive to create a scalable, interconnected web3 landscape. As Analog’s network grows, so too does the significance of $ANLOG in fostering cross-chain dapps that allow data and assets to flow freely. It can be hard to visualize what amorphous concepts such as interoperability look like in reality, but there’s already a taster of what the Analog community can expect in the form of Zenswap . Developed using Analog’s tech stack, the cross-chain DEX enables assets to be swapped across such chains as TON, Solana, and Bitcoin, using USDC-based routing. Once Analog’s mainnet deploys, it will be joined by a host of other omnichain dapps from over 50 partners that are already under development.

The LBP, lasting 48 hours, encourages community-driven price discovery and equal token access, aligning with Analog’s mission to develop open and decentralized infrastructure. Tokens acquired through the LBP will be fully available for the upcoming Token Generation Event (TGE). The $ANLOG LBP will be accessible on Fjord Foundry from 06:00 AM CET on January 21, 2025, until 05:59 AM CET on January 23, 2025. Ensuring Fairness in $ANLOG Access Through LBP LBPs have become popular for their fair token distribution, utilizing a dynamic pricing mechanism that adjusts according to participant interest. This method contrasts with traditional launches, where fixed prices often favor early large-scale investors over smaller ones. Using Fjord Foundry’s platform, Analog intends to ensure the widest possible distribution of $ANLOG, a crucial feature for launching new tokens or networks. Opting for an LBP on Fjord Foundry for its $ANLOG sale was a clear choice for Analog. LBPs are specifically crafted to democratize token access, starting with high prices that gradually decline until they stabilize based on market demand. This model allows participants to determine the token’s value, avoiding the speculative spikes common in traditional launches. Fjord Foundry’s community-centric token sale platform has successfully supported several projects with its LBP model. This infrastructure aligns perfectly with Analog’s vision of creating an ecosystem that emphasizes accessibility and fairness for both developers and users. With a recent $5M seed round, bringing its total funding to $21M, Analog is on track to provide the interoperable layer connecting all major blockchains. The Role of $ANLOG in Analog's Ecosystem The $ANLOG token is integral to Analog’s Layer 0 protocol, which facilitates smooth cross-chain data and transaction processes.

The company’s CEO confirmed that Rumble has made its first Bitcoin (BTC) purchase and hinted that this will not be the last. Rumble CEO Confirms Bitcoin Purchase In a post shared on X earlier today, Rumble CEO Chris Pavlovski announced that the video streaming platform made its first BTC purchase on January 17. Pavlovski further stated that this purchase “won’t be the last,” suggesting the company may increase its Bitcoin holdings in the coming months. Pavlovski, however, did not disclose the exact amount of BTC purchased. Nonetheless, Rumble’s move underscores the growing trend of corporations adding BTC to their balance sheets. It’s worth noting that Rumble’s CEO first hinted at a corporate crypto purchase in November 2024, when he conducted a poll on X asking users whether Rumble should add BTC to its balance sheet. Over 39,000 people participated in the poll, with an overwhelming majority voting in favor of the move. Renowned Bitcoin advocate and MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor even responded, offering to discuss “why and how” Bitcoin could be a strategic asset for Rumble. Subsequently, in December 2024, Rumble unveiled a Bitcoin treasury strategy as it set aside $20 million to purchase the leading digital asset. At the time, Pavlovski described Bitcoin as a “valuable tool for strategic planning.” Interestingly, Rumble’s stock (RUM) closed 5.31% higher at the end of trading on Friday. Although the stock market is closed today in observance of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, RUM could see further gains when trading resumes tomorrow. BTC Adoption To Grow Exponentially In 2025? Bitcoin saw unprecedented adoption in 2024, with milestones such as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and an increasing number of companies incorporating Bitcoin into their treasury strategies. However, 2025 promises to bring even greater adoption. The election of pro-crypto Republican candidate Donald Trump as US president has fueled speculation about the creation of a US Bitcoin strategic reserve. If implemented , such a reserve could become the most significant catalyst to date for cementing Bitcoin’s status as a reliable and trusted store of value. A recent report by Fidelity Digital Assets outlines rising nation-state and government adoption of BTC as the major factors that may drive the cryptocurrency’s growth in 2025. Similarly, Standard Chartered predicts that BTC can reach as high as $200,000 by the end of 2025, buoyed by favourable crypto regulations under Trump’s presidency. That said, changes in global macroeconomic policies could pose a danger to BTC’s bullish momentum. At press time, BTC trades at $107,608, up 1.6% in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Adoption|Bitcoin treasury strategy|btc|BTCUSDT|corporate adoption|digital asset|MicroStrategy|RUM|Rumble,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-01-21 09:30:54

However, token prices have crashed by 60% in just one day, as traders react to Trump’s omission of crypto from his much-anticipated inaugural speech. Melania Token Price Plunge Before the inauguration, Melania’s MELANIA token reached a market value of $2 billion hitting a high of $11.41 . However, after Trump’s speech, it dropped to just $750 million, now settling at $4.91 reflecting a drop of almost 54%. The price drop fell drastically due to President Donald Trump’s inaugural speech omitted any mention of cryptocurrencies and blockchain. In addition to it, the fall was partly due to traders cashing out on the profit after the initial price surge. Many in the crypto community had high hopes that Trump’s inauguration speech would include mentions of cryptocurrency. Some expected him to announce a Bitcoin reserve or discuss crypto-friendly policies. But when Trump didn’t mention digital assets at all, the market reacted with disappointment, causing both meme coins to plummet. TRUMP Token Even Crashed Similarly, the Trump token saw its market cap fall from $13.72 billion to $8.27 billion while its price currently trades at $40.8 reflecting a drop of 28%. Before this drop, trading activity was very high, with $26.7 billion worth of tokens exchanged in just 24 hours, showing strong interest at the start.

Both these coins achieved massive growth in the initial hours post-launch. It seems that the buzz created by the Trump family-related meme coins has encouraged many to rethink their view of the meme coin sector. The recent announcement by American business leader Mark Cuban, who was once a highly vocal critic of meme coins, regarding his intention to launch a meme coin is the best example. Interestingly, for Cuban, his project is not ordinary, but extraordinary due to its vision. What’s his vision? Can his meme coin overturn the destiny of the US economy? Let’s examine! Mark Cuban’s Meme Coin Proposal In an X post published by Mark Cuban early today, he has expressed his intention to launch a meme coin, emphasising his plan to use the same terms as $TRUMP. This implies that his coin will have a 20% float. Reports suggest that Cuban’s coin will have a release schedule matching the Official Trump token. Meanwhile, what makes the meme coin of Mark Cuban unique is its plan to send all its revenues to the US Treasury. In short, Cuban’s meme coin aims to help reduce the US national debt through a transparent and community-driven approach. In December 2024, the US Government Debt grew from $36087363 Million to $36218605 Million. Cuban’s Assurances: Transparency and Accountability Cuban has assured the public that he will publish the treasury’s wallet address, emphasising his commitment to enabling public tracking. He has also promised to safeguard his meme coin from pump-and-dump schemes and false promises. Meme Coin Investors Concerns and Challenges Many X users, like artchick.eth, have raised concerns about investor risks and distribution hurdles. Cuban has also acknowledged the speculative nature of the meme coin sector, highlighting that the success of a meme coin depends on how quickly its community strength grows. $Trump has seen a massive drop of $31.5% in the last 24 hours, despite the tremendous growth it achieved in the initial hours post-launch. $MELANIA has also experienced a significant fall of -54.9% during the same period. The TRUMP price now stands at $40.03, and the MELANIA price at $4.94. In conclusion, Mark Cuban’s innovative idea combines crypto and public good.

Bitcoin (BTC) hit an all-time high of almost $110K but dropped to $102K after Trump’s inauguration, which lacked crypto mentions. Ripple (XRP) peaked at $3.30 before dipping to $3.08, though analysts remain optimistic about a potential rally. Trump-Themed Memes Went Crazy The past several days have been more than eventful for the cryptocurrency industry, whose global market capitalization briefly surpassed $3.8 trillion on January 20 before plunging to its current $3.65 trillion (per CoinGecko’s data). Perhaps the most apparent reason for the enhanced volatility was the hype surrounding Donald Trump’s official return to the White House as America’s 47th President. Besides taking center stage on the political scene, the Republican also made waves in the crypto sector, launching a meme coin of his own. The token, called Official Trump (TRUMP), saw the light of day on January 18. Shortly after, it experienced a spectacular price increase, and its market capitalization surged past $14.5 billion. As it often happens in the meme coin niche, though, the rally was followed by a painful correction. TRUMP is currently worth approximately $38, representing a nearly 50% decline from its peak. TRUMP Price, Source: CoinGecko Interestingly, the price started retracing minutes after Melania Trump (Donald Trump’s wife) also jumped on the meme coin bandwagon. She introduced Melania Meme (MELANIA), which at one point reached $2 billion in market cap. This rise was likely fueled by Binance, Bybit, and other leading crypto exchanges, which allowed trading services with the asset. Similar to TRUMP, though, MELANIA headed south in the following hours and is currently trading at around $4.50 (a 50% plunge on a 24-hour scale). MELANIA Price, Source: CoinGecko BTC’s New Peak The primary cryptocurrency experienced severe turbulence, too . As CryptoPotato reported , its price skyrocketed to a new all-time high of almost $110,000 on January 20. However, as the day progressed, BTC started losing steam. It tumbled below $102,000 minutes after Donald Trump’s inauguration. The Republican touched upon numerous topics during his speech but did not mention the cryptocurrency industry at all , which might explain why the asset underperformed. In the following hours, BTC reached a local bottom of around $100K before the bulls stepped in and pushed the valuation to the current $102,100.

Its solid performance coincided with the bullish environment in the entire crypto space and the increased whale activity. Nonetheless, the market decline in the past several hours has negatively affected XRP, and as of this writing, it is trading at roughly $3.08.

Pro-crypto Mark Uyeda has been named as the acting SEC Chair until Paul Atkins is confirmed by the Senate. XRP is expected to print massive gains as it is one of the digital assets “made in America.” Ripple may see significant benefits under the pro-crypto administration of Donald Trump and the new U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Former SEC Chair Gary Gensler has been replaced by acting Chairman Mark Uyeda, with Paul Atkins awaiting Senate confirmation as the permanent chair, according to Reuters . The ongoing lawsuit between Ripple and the SEC, involving XRP token sales, could take a favorable turn for cryptocurrencies under this new leadership.

Is this case unique?,https://crypto.news/australian-couple-sold-their-land-in-a-btc-only-sale/,"Two couples of vendors in Ballarat exhibited their 582m² land block for sale, accepting only Bitcoin payments. Why do people sell real estate for crypto, and how does the latter disrupt the real estate market? Table of Contents The land in question Why did they sell it for Bitcoin? Do people often pay for real estate in crypto? Blockchain and the real estate sector The land in question The block at 7 Magpie Street was bought by vendors Melissa Bower and Trudy Purcell in 2021 with plans of renovating and turning this place into “something magnificent.” Ballarat itself is a picturesque place that is not far away from several attractions like Sovereign Hill. However, the property itself needed some tweaking. At the time when the couple bought this land, it was just an old miners’ cottage, a relic of a gold rush-era Ballarat. The metamorphosis of this place into a beautiful spot proved to be a harder task than the couple thought. While Bower, Purcell, and another couple of owners, Sasha Semjonov and Tessa Dunstan, did get the permit for building two townhouses on the vacant land, the economic outlook, including inflation and interests running high, proved these plans to be not suitable. They realized that they shouldn’t spend their money on materials and labor, and instead, they were better off selling t he block. Why did they sell it for Bitcoin? Purcell and Bower provided a simple explanation of why they wanted to sell the land for Bitcoin, not for fiat money. The main reason is to reduce the middleman costs. Instead of losing time and money on estate agents and bank operations, they want a quick and safe transaction that won’t cost much, and Bitcoin is the way to go. The block was sold. According to the vendors, everything took one hour, with no inspection or staging taking place. Bower said that today, social media platforms play a huge role in selling estate and pointed out TikTok as an example. Do people often pay for real estate in crypto? The Ballarat land trade turned heads, but we can’t say that Australians were the only ones to sell the estate for Bitcoin. Another notable case is the $22 million penthouse in Miami sold for cryptocurrency in 2021. At the time, it was considered the biggest real estate deal made via cryptocurrency. Even though Bitcoin is not even a legal tender anywhere but in El Salvador, more and more people around the world use crypto to pay for real estate. If we factor in people who pay in fiat money but use blockchain to keep the real estate records, we will find out even more cases. For instance, the Republic of Georgia uses blockchain to maintain property registers on the national level. Many choose crypto to pay for property because it allows them to save money on intermediaries and lifts the barriers associated with cross-border transactions. Interestingly, some people buy real estate for fiat money, but they accumulate the necessary amounts through investment in crypto. The Fairway study revealed that in the fourth quarter of 2021 nearly 12% of all first-time homebuyers used the money they made via selling their crypto holdings. This shift illustrates how vital cryptocurrency became in the 2020s and how influential it is for the real estate market, even if the deals themselves take place off-chain for fiat money. The other report says that crypto is fueling the 2020s real estate boom in the United States. Not to mention, some people sell their houses to invest in Bitcoin. The crazy fact is that real estate becomes increasingly cheap if we evaluate it in Bitcoin rather than fiat money, as the BTC price has been growing faster than the real estate prices in USD. Real estate investing is a gamble but most people don't want to admit it I don't care how great the location is You buy houses because you expect the price to go up Bitcoin adoption will lead to deflation On a Bitcoin standard, real estate investing makes no sense, no matter… pic.twitter.com/V2NEh6qTFO — Rajat Soni, CFA (@rajatsonifnance) January 11, 2025 Blockchain and the real estate sector Since the release of Ethereum whitepaper, blockchain has become a tool shaping the new reality. Any sector that involves data can benefit from blockchain. What’s more important is that blockchain does not make life easier for only one party involved. The best projects create a win-win balance. Probably, the middlemen are the only category that gets cut off. The real estate market is one of the biggest markets in the world. Not only do we use real estate for life and work, but we also see real estate as an investment. That’s why this sector couldn’t go unnoticed by blockchain entrepreneurs. Moreover, real estate is notorious for savage intermediary fees and cumbersome bureaucracy. Looks like a job for a blockchain dApp! The real estate deals with the ownership rights. Blockchain gives owners an easy tool to trade their estate without having to deal with such traditional entities as banks, agents, and so on. The trade is done through smart contracts embedded in the local legal space to ensure that the ownership will be passed to a buyer as soon as the payment takes place. As smart contracts are automatic, they don’t take agent fees. Blockchain eliminates time-consuming, exhausting paperwork, allowing counterparts to trade property quickly as soon as they agree on the conditions. No bank or other entity can intervene and delay the process. The ownership is verified, and buyers can access all the necessary legal information about the estate they are going to buy. Through the tokenization of real estate, owners may sell fractions of their property in the form of digital tokens. This trend democratizes real estate trading. Read more: Tokenization is the inevitable future of real estate | Opinion Landlords are not left behind as well. There are apps that streamline rent collection and other matters via crypto payments. In general, it’s safe to say that real estate gradually embraces crypto just like the other sectors do. Although some consider crypto price volatility to be a hurdle for the adoption of crypto as real estate money, others seek fortune, hoping the crypto they get in exchange for a house will rise in value in the future.

Once a popular choice among investors, the token’s steep decline followed Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration, which initially raised hopes of a market boost. Whale Activity Shakes Confidence Whale activity has played a major role in the token’s price crash. According to Lookonchain data, two major transactions were recorded, including a sale by a whale named Ansem, who offloaded 194,799 TRUMP tokens worth $6.83 million, incurring a $2.55 million loss.

Solana-based tokens like MELANIA, BONK, and WIF have suffered substantial losses, with MELANIA down 62.7%, BONK losing 1.7%, and WIF dropping 5.4%. Allegations of a pump-and-dump scheme involving Cuba, which reportedly rug-pulled $158 million, have added to investor concerns. Despite the downturn, some analysts see potential buying opportunities. Platforms like Coingecko have flagged BONK and WIF as promising investments, with similar sentiment emerging for TRUMP. However, the token’s future depends heavily on investor confidence and possible executive orders from President Trump, who has hinted at crypto-friendly reforms. In the meanwhile, Coinbase listing of TRUMP has also created a buying opportunity for Trump’s coin. Analysts Warns of Risks I was like…ok…I wouldn’t have done this memecoin…but how could they make the best of this, and mitigate the crash?

Joining the fray, Mark Cuban, a Big Crypto Investor has also critized TRUMP memecoin calling it a self-serving project with no real world use. Mint it, Print it, Sell it Fuck it.

The fee record surpassed previous periods of peak trading activity. Peak trading activity for Official Trump (TRUMP) increased bribes and fees to validators above 100K SOL over two days of active trading. Validators marked a peak both in terms of SOL inflows and a record number of bundles and posting wallets. Peak trading happened on January 20, when validators received more than 87K SOL. The exceptional activity was mostly tied to the TRUMP token rally. The asset took a step back, sliding to $40.12, after peaking above $70. A total of 24.7M bundles were sent out to guarantee transaction success. While base SOL sending fees remained low, interacting with some apps incurred much higher expenses. A total of 1.5M unique tippers paid out the fees, out of a total 4.5M Solana daily active users. Peak tippers underscored the interest in TRUMP and related tokens, for sniping and early swaps on Meteora and Orca. Validators worked overtime to post transactions to the main chain, especially during temporary outages of some Solana services. Helius Labs, Solayer, and JitoSOL, managed to ensure access for experienced traders. However, not all transactions went through, leading to competitive posting and record-high fees. Jito received SOL both as a validator and as a MEV service, rising to about 10% of total fees. Solana itself has not posted a status for being offline or having problem with its consensus. During the early hours of TRUMP and MELANIA launches, transactions were still highly competitive, using bots and sniping techniques. Users that tried to go through Coinbase saw their SOL transactions pending for hours. Solana grows its real economic value The fees and tips on Solana are the chain’s real economic value, showing the real demand of users. Meme token demand, whether for Pump.fun tokens or other launches, reveals the preferences of real users and the chain’s leading application. On Solana, block building does not include sandwich attacks or other forms of sniping, meaning all tip payers are traders interested in the potential of the latest tokens. MEV activity is seen as positive for Solana and one of the big incentives to validators. Solana’s economic value rose as tips were necessary to achieve decentralized swaps for TRUMP and other tokens. | Source: Blockworks The real economic value showed base fees were a negligible source of income, and no voting transactions were handled in the past few days. However, the bulk of activity came from Jito tips and priority fees. Solana’s period of exceptional economic activity also affected stakers and holders, where annualized passive income can rise to 7.14%, while inflation is under 5%. The latest meme trading peak also caused record SOL burns, balancing the slightly higher new issuance and fees. Solana also showed it could handle much higher traffic compared to Ethereum, though still reaching the limit of its services. In the past 24 hours, Solana still produced more than 35M in fees . Meteora also shot forward as the new venue for meme tokens, gaining more than $59M in fees. The entire Solana ecosystem took part in the latest drive to snipe the latest tokens. The MEVX and Trojan bots were among the biggest fee producers, as bot activity reached peak levels. Phantom wallet lined up among the top 10 fee producers, despite a brief overload period. SOL open interest slides after the initial frenzy The peak SOL activity did not result in an immediate rally for SOL. Open interest for SOL slid from over $5.1B down to $3.5B. SOL retreated to $233, after peaking above $270. For now, SOL has slowed down and has not fulfilled the expectations of rising to $300. Even days after the launch of TRUMP, Coinbase users complained of delayed SOL transactions. SOL expects to move to a higher price range, as its activity habitually surpasses that of Ethereum. The ease of launching tokens and the growing liquidity might mean Solana is displacing Ethereum as the hub for token activity.

This commitment comes on the heels of Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin’s recent statement on X, where he emphasized the foundation’s plans to embrace organizational changes . The new direction aims to provide greater support to decentralized application developers while fostering community transparency. The allocated funds will be secured using a three-of-five multisig wallet on Safe, ensuring robust security for the initiative. Hsiao-Wei Wang, a representative of the foundation, shared on January 20 that the wallet had already undergone a successful test transaction via the lending protocol Aave. However, Wang also noted that it may take a few days to fully set up the wallet for its intended operations. Treasury Pressures and Community Criticism This move represents a significant shift for the Ethereum Foundation, as the 50,000 Ether constitutes 18.5% of its current holdings. The foundation’s treasury has seen a considerable decline , dropping by 56% from 617,000 Ether in January 2020 to 269,000 Ether today, as per data from Arkham Intelligence. Despite this, Buterin remains steadfast in prioritizing the network’s long-term growth over immediate financial concerns. However, the announcement has sparked mixed reactions within the Ethereum community. Critics, such as Infinix founder Kain Warwick, have previously accused the Ethereum Foundation of neglecting the DeFi space, while others have raised concerns over the selling pressure created by the foundation to meet its operational costs. To address these concerns, core developer Eric Conner suggested leveraging staking rewards to cover internal budgets and reduce the need for selling Ether. Ethereum Foundation Balancing Vision with Expectations Buterin has clarified that the Ethereum Foundation is not planning an ideological shift or lobbying efforts, emphasizing its commitment to being “credibly neutral.” This approach contrasts with some community sentiments, which blame the foundation’s perceived lack of engagement for Ether’s lagging price performance relative to competitors like Bitcoin and Solana. Nonetheless, the foundation’s decision to allocate substantial resources to DeFi has garnered support from figures like CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, who praised Buterin for prioritizing innovation over profit.

Notably, the crypto exchange on Tuesday revealed that it is adding the TRUMP USD-Margined perpetual contract to its futures copy trading division, alongside new listings for seven other assets. In response, traders and investors remain bullish regarding the future price action of these tokens, primarily as their market exposure increases with new listings on leading cryptocurrency exchanges. Binance Unveils Futures Listing For TRUMP & 7 Other Crypto Assets According to an official Binance announcement dated January 21, the crypto exchange giant is adding 8 USD-Margined perpetual contracts to its futures copy trading division at 08:00 UTC. Notably, per the announcement, the crypto exchange is adding TRUMPUSDT, ARCUSDT, AVAAIUSDT, DEXEUSDT, HIVEUSDT, PROMUSDT, SOLVUSDT, and SONICUSDT perpetual contracts for users, allowing them to copy experienced traders’ portfolios in real-time. As a result, market sentiments surrounding these tokens have turned highly optimistic. The bullish anticipation comes as crypto enthusiasts expect a gush of money inflow into these assets as investors continue to gauge opportunities that maximize gains, as in with Binance copy trading. Also, it’s noteworthy that the same exchange revealed another vital update on the new TRUMP token. Notably, the platform’s spot trading division has commenced trading for the asset pegged to TRY starting on the same date and time. Overall, the enhanced trade offerings continue to project market optimism surrounding the new meme coin on Solana, boosting market visibility. Bithumb Joins The Fray Amid Major Listings Simultaneously, a leading S. Korean cryptocurrency exchange has recently revealed an update on the TRUMP coin, expanding market support for the asset. As per a Bithumb announcement, the crypto exchange is adding the new Solana meme coin to the Won market. This listing has further cemented the broader market’s optimism on the token, coming alongside the abovementioned listings on Binance. Meanwhile, CoinGape reported that even Coinbase expanded support for the TRUMP token. Whilst leading exchanges offer support to the new crypto project, it’s also worth mentioning that Republican Donald Trump concluded his presidential inauguration on Monday. The new meme coin has emerged as the talk of the crypto town, primarily in light of this saga, supported by previous price gains. How Is The Meme Coin Currently Delivering? At the time of reporting, TRUMP price crashed nearly 31% intraday and is trading at $40.31. Its 24-hour low and high were $31.01 and $61.12, respectively. Despite soaring optimism in light of major listings on Binance, Coinbase, and Bithumb, the token’s waning movement has raised severe investor concerns. Nevertheless, CoinGape recently reported that the meme coin is likely gearing up for a rally to $54, as spotlighted by a leading crypto market analyst. Notably, analyst Ali Martinez claims that the technical patterns hint at a bullish breakout looming for the token.

This review highlights the platform’s outstanding achievements in terms of key metrics, wealth-generation capabilities, and ecosystem advancements. Strong Asset Performance Fuels HTX’s Stellar 2024 In 2024, HTX achieved a total trading volume of approximately $2.4 trillion, marking an impressive 100% year-on-year growth. Spot trades of approximately 62% of this volume, reaching$1.5 trillion, increased by 160%, and futures trades reached $900 billion, increased by 70%. Overall, trading volumes climbed steadily throughout the year. In 2024, HTX listed 218 spot assets across trending sectors like DePIN, RWA, meme coins, and SunPump, including 171 exclusive first-to-market launches. For futures trading, more than 80 assets were added to the platform, with nearly 70, or over 90%, experiencing gains exceeding 200%. By the end of 2024, HTX supported over 160 futures trading assets, providing users with a diverse range of trading options. Furthermore, HTX Earn has covered 166 mainstream cryptos with 2,725 listed projects and served more than 500,000 users with managed funds exceeding $1 billion. 2024 also saw explosive user growth. As of the end of 2024, HTX boasted a user base of more than 49 million , with nearly 80 billion visits on its website and app. Notably, the percentage of active users surged significantly, demonstrating HTX’s ability to foster engagement and trust. As a world-leading digital asset trading platform, HTX has consistently attracted users worldwide, further solidifying its prominent position. A Year of Explosive Wealth Growth: One High-Potential Project Each Month HTX’s wealth-generation prowess comes from its diverse asset offerings, rapid new listings, and robust innovation capabilities. HTX DAO’s governance token, $HTX, for example, experienced extraordinary growth, soaring from $0.0000008 in early 2024 to a record high of $0.000003596, representing an increase of 350%. Currently traded at $0.0000023, the token achieved an average gain of nearly threefold. Additionally, $22.47 million worth of $HTX tokens were burned in Q4 2024, bolstering ecosystem stability and further driving $HTX’s market value. HTX also launched memecoins that played a pivotal role in creating wealth opportunities. In 2024, with a keen eye on market developments and a focus on precise asset selection, the platform delivered substantial returns by focusing on trending sectors and emerging ecosystems like memecoins, AI, RWA, and SunPump. Each month, at least one promising token was listed, generating extraordinary gains: January: WIF surged 1,987%, riding the Solana meme trend. February: ONDO, launched as a joint decentralized governance project with Flux Finance, grew 740%. March: BOME climbed 300%, quickly becoming a market favorite. April: ENA, centered on synthetic US dollars, rose 637%. May: MAGA, fueled by Trump-related election buzz, soared 1,995%. June: IO, focusing on decentralized DePIN computation, increased 117%. July: FIGHT gained 152% by leveraging political narratives. August: SUNDOG became a standout in TRON’s SunPump ecosystem, skyrocketing 3,700%. September: NEIROCTO, backed by the Neiro community, exploded by 7,281%. October: FARTCOIN surged an astounding 16,000% by combining the concepts of AI and memecoins. November: PNUT, inspired by Elon Musk’s political themes, rose 733%. December: VIRTUAL made steady gains in the AI and metaverse infrastructure sector, increasing 104%. By consistently uncovering promising assets, HTX has outperformed in wealth creation throughout the year. Its ability to swiftly spot top-tier cryptos has provided users with exceptional returns. Simply by keeping an eye on HTX’s newly listed assets, users can be confident that they won’t miss out on any lucrative opportunities. It’s worth noting that HTX further enriched its offerings with financial derivatives and engaging events, including SmartEarn with 14% APY during the Lunar New Year, Launchpool with multiple rewards for single investments, and Flexible Crypto Loans with dynamic interest rates, to cater to the diverse needs of investors. These initiatives empowered users to achieve higher returns while managing risks effectively, further enhancing their asset growth potential. The Logic Behind HTX’s New Asset Listings: A Focus on Long-Term Ecosystem Growth HTX’s rationale of listing new assets extends beyond merely capitalizing on market trends or popular tokens. It reflects the platform’s strategic vision for emerging sectors. For example, in rapidly evolving fields such as AI, HTX has quickly introduced related assets, demonstrating its focus on technological advancements and its foresight regarding market shifts. This approach not only drives innovation within the industry but also solidifies HTX’s position as a leader in blockchain and related sectors. Additionally, HTX has responded to the needs of its community by continually striving to offer a diverse array of investment options and enrich users’ asset portfolios. Furthermore, through new asset launches, the platform has contributed to a healthier blockchain industry and the flourishing of blockchain ecosystems. It not only provides a platform for innovative projects to thrive but also collaborates with these initiatives to accelerate industry maturity and foster prosperity. Moving forward, HTX will continue to support emerging projects with resources to help them gain more attention and access to growth opportunities. In this way, HTX can revitalize its own ecosystem while offering steadfast support for global blockchain innovation, driving long-term industry progress. Consider the example of the SunPump ecosystem. Recognizing a market recovery in Q3 2024, HTX acted swiftly to support SunPump by being the first to list its eight tokens, including SUNDOG, SUNCAT, SUNWUKONG, FOFAR, TRONBULL, TBULL, MUNCAT, and IVFUN. This early move provided HTX with a significant market advantage. Among these, SUNDOG stood out with an extraordinary 37x increase following its listing, becoming the flagship project within the SunPump ecosystem. HTX’s comprehensive effort provided a powerful boost to SunPump while also affording users lucrative opportunities to share in on-chain rewards. Moreover, Justin Sun, Global Advisor of HTX, has made substantial contributions to the growth of SunPump. He facilitated a reduction in gas fees for trading memecoins on TRON and fostered key ecosystem partnerships, such as a 98% reduction in transaction fees for trading memecoins on TRON through OKX Wallet. These efforts significantly improved the user experience and boosted both user engagement and participation, further invigorating the SunPump ecosystem. Ecosystem development necessitates both strategic insight and long-term planning. As Justin Sun remarked on social media, “In the future, AI will play a crucial role in resource allocation, financial decision-making, and other key areas, enhancing efficiency across industries and driving smarter, more transparent, and fairer business models.” With a deep understanding of the AI ecosystem, HTX recognizes the technology as a pivotal force in driving innovation and solving complex problems. As we move into an era increasingly dominated by AI agents, HTX is proactively embracing this transformation by combining AI technology with blockchain. This integration will facilitate intelligent evolutions within ecosystems, creating greater value for both users and the industry. Leading the Charge: Fast, Accurate Asset Listings for a Win-Win “People’s Exchange” HTX distinguishes itself among major exchanges with its efficiency in asset listings, wealth generation, and community engagement, consistently maintaining a keen awareness of market trends and emerging opportunities. Prior to most competitors, the platform discovered and introduced premium projects like WIF, MYRO, BOME, NEIROCTO, and ACTSOL, witnessing their rise and success alongside community members and enabling users to capture early-stage profits. Notably, WIF and MYRO served as catalysts for the Solana meme bull market. HTX, with its acute market awareness, swiftly identified this trend and launched Solana-based meme assets to empower investors. This early action yielded significant results: for example, WIF surged by 19x following its listing, sparking widespread excitement within the community. According to official announcements and data, BOME, NEIROCTO, WIF, TURBO, and ACTSOL all made their debut on HTX prior to other major exchanges, granting the platform a first-mover advantage. As a result, HTX demonstrated superior opening performance. For instance, BOME opened at 0.0005 USDT on HTX , compared to 0.0073 USDT on Binance (a 14.6x difference). Similarly, WIF opened on HTX at 0.04 USDT, 25x lower than its opening price on Binance. TURBO exhibited an even more striking contrast, with an opening price of 0.0006 USDT on HTX versus 0.03 USDT on Binance (a 50x difference). Thanks to its early listings and more competitive initial pricing, HTX provided users with greater investment potential and enhanced their opportunities for significant returns. Another example of HTX’s asset selection prowess is the early listing of NEIROCTO and ACTSOL. Despite their relatively low initial prices, HTX chose to launch these tokens and maintained close ties with community members, consistently supporting and collaborating with them. As these projects gained market momentum and were listed on Binance, they experienced explosive growth, creating valuable wealth opportunities for HTX users. By listing these tokens at an early stage, HTX allowed users to enter at a lower price. As these tokens garnered wider market recognition, they often attracted increased attention and trading volume, driving their prices up. This strategy underscores HTX’s core strength as a premier platform for quality assets: “Spot Early, List Early.” This provides users with access to high-potential early investment opportunities. For those seeking emerging projects and aiming for high returns, HTX’s first-mover advantage and low initial prices can be the key to unlocking substantial profits. Looking Ahead to 2025: Listening to Users and Creating a New Era of Wealth In 2024, HTX’s asset performance demonstrated the potential of a digital asset platform to generate substantial wealth for its users through innovation and services. From the impressive price surges of newly listed assets to extensive participation in community events, HTX has successfully established itself as a premier platform for wealth creation. User feedback provides the clearest evidence of HTX’s impact on wealth creation. On social media, numerous users have shared their experiences of achieving financial growth by engaging with HTX’s new assets, expressing their appreciation for the platform’s careful asset selection. One user commented, “Despite facing widespread skepticism, HTX has evolved from a small exchange into a top-tier platform that leads the industry. I hope the HTX team continues to uncover more premium projects to reward the community!” As 2025 unfolds, HTX will collaborate with users to embrace the next wave of wealth creation through sharper market insights, refined asset selection, and continuous community development. Initially, HTX will continue to expand its asset categories by incorporating more high-potential cryptos to broaden wealth opportunities for users. The platform will also foster industry growth by actively seeking projects with long-term value for the crypto industry and providing them with more resources for collaborative industry development. More importantly, HTX will remain committed to its community, actively engaging with users, prioritizing their needs, attentively listening to community feedback, opposing conspiracy tokens, and striving to build the platform into the “People’s Exchange.” In 2025, a year brimming with opportunities and challenges, HTX will maintain its focus on trending sectors and emerging assets with a user-centric approach. The platform will work more closely within the broader industry ecosystem, lead the industry through multi-dimensional innovations, and co-create a new chapter of crypto wealth with users worldwide. Let’s anticipate the remarkable legacy of wealth creation that HTX will build in 2025!

Bitcoin and Solana are top picks for this cycle, with Coinbase and Robinhood as key equities benefiting from crypto adoption. The era of tokenized capital is here, and those who position themselves early can benefit greatly from the reshaping of capital markets and capital formation. Since the evening of 17 January 2025, social media has been abuzz with the news of a high-profile memecoin tied to President Donald Trump. The ticker is TRUMP . The token was launched at the time of a “ Crypto Ball ” celebrating the inauguration of President Trump, who is dubbed as “the first crypto president” thanks to his expressed support for the industry on the campaign trail. This is a highly unprecedented move from a former and incoming POTUS. What makes this situation more amusing is that the token launch happened just a few hours after Gary Gensler, officially departed from his position as Chair of the SEC. Gensler has been widely viewed as antagonistic towards crypto over the course of his administration. The criticism on social media amongst crypto circles over this token launch has been quite severe, even as the token price has performed extremely well. TRUMP went up to over a $70 billion fully diluted valuation. Then on 19 January, the MELANIA token was launched (a memecoin of former and incoming First Lady Melania Trump). MELANIA has reached a $11 billion FDV. I believe these actions by an incoming POTUS speaks volumes about the outlook of the crypto industry and the capital markets. This article is about breaking down the implications. Here’s the short version: Trump has legitimized token-based capital formation, possibly opening the floodgates for legitimate small businesses and entrepreneurs. Not only could this be the start of possibly the strongest bull market crypto has ever seen, but it also highlights that the procedure of capital formation is likely changing right before our eyes. This second point is, in my view, far more important than a crypto bull market. Launching a token is objectively a more efficient way of raising capital (as I will show ahead), and this method just received the greenlight from the most powerful politician in the world. If you are involved in capital markets in any way at all, you probably should pay close attention to what is happening. The Historical Challenge of Capital Formation For years, small businesses and entrepreneurs have faced significant barriers to raising capital. Traditional capital markets are riddled with high costs, complex regulations, and bureaucratic gatekeeping, making it highly costly for smaller entities to access funding. Public companies enjoy a lower cost of capital, partly because they have the scale to afford all the regulatory overhead required to become listed in public markets. In contrast, small businesses are often left out, even if they have honest intentions and viable business models. Crypto promised to democratize this process by enabling anyone to launch a token, but that promise has largely fallen short. Unfortunately, the core reason for this was the lack of regulatory clarity. Any honest business or entrepreneur who wanted to use crypto rails for capital formation was taking on a massive risk. As a result, crypto has proliferated with scams and speculative projects. The only real use cases in crypto have been facilitating the speculation of tokens (effectively serving as a casino). This situation has been the norm over the last 6 years. Trump’s Memecoin: Possibly Legitimizing Crypto As A Fundraising Tool Trump’s memecoin is a black swan event which breaks the current pattern. By leveraging his status and influence, Trump has demonstrated that tokens are a legitimate option, and can potentially be used to bypass the high hurdles of traditional capital markets. More importantly, he is signaling with his own action that the U.S. will become much more crypto-friendly. Now, I want to make it clear that this is not any kind of recommendation to buy Trump’s memecoin. What I am highlighting is that if the president can do this just days before taking office, then it literally opens the floodgates for anyone to do it. And perception is rapidly shifting towards the view that crypto is about to undergo a Renaissance moment with American de-regulation and adoption. Trump’s involvement gives credibility and official approval to the concept, signaling to entrepreneurs and small businesses that crypto tokens can be used for real-world applications. For instance: A bakery could launch a token, using profits to buy and burn the token, creating value for token holders via a deflationary token supply. This would be financially equivalent to a stock buyback. A farm could issue a token where staking yields are tied to agricultural profits. This would be financially equivalent to issuing dividends. Tokens can easily be tied to real-world cash flows of real-world business, moving beyond the speculation-driven business models that currently dominate crypto. With Trump paving the way, we could see an influx of businesses and entrepreneurs utilizing token-based models to accelerate the capital formation process. Why Tokens Are More Efficient Tokens offer unparalleled efficiency compared to traditional methods of raising funds. First and foremost, tokens eliminate the need for cumbersome intermediaries like investment banks, underwriters, and extensive legal teams, significantly reducing the cost and complexity of launching a capital asset. Unlike traditional fundraising mechanisms, which often require months of preparation and compliance with layers of regulatory hurdles, tokens can be issued and traded almost instantly, democratizing access to capital markets. Anyone can launch a token by paying less than $5 in blockchain network fees. Additionally, tokens enable better flexibility. They can be programmed with smart contracts to automate processes such as dividend distribution, buybacks, or staking rewards, reducing administrative overhead and enhancing transparency. Token holders can directly and immediately participate in the issuer's success, fostering a stronger alignment of incentives between businesses and their investors. Another advantage is that tokens can be traded 24/7 on globally accessible platforms. This creates better access and price discovery. Moreover, the total supply, all the holders and their respective transactions are all visible at all times on the public blockchain. When you tally it all up, launching a token is a more efficient method of capital formation in every conceivable objective metric of capital formation: Speed of execution Frequency, if there is a need to do it multiple times Cost to launch compared to value received from a launch Transparency of supply, holders, transactions Price discovery Accessibility If honest businesses aren't barred from tapping this avenue, then it absolutely helps them. And so far, honest businesses have been barred from tapping this avenue of capital formation because of regulatory uncertainty and hostility. Trump has arguably single-handedly reversed this dynamic. Now, I do want to make it clear that in order for this market to be fair and efficient, there does have to be trust in any business that is attempting a launch. Even though launching a token is very simple, procuring the documents for potential investors to review is harder. In the case of tokens, there may be less regulatory oversight and this allows people to conduct a capital markets transaction in a more peer-to-peer manner. A business can release the records they have and the plans they have. They can utilize Twitter spaces and social media to speak directly to the public, and interested individuals can invest in the token that was launched, or raise inquiries in the same public forums. In other words, the due diligence and transparency process is transferred from regulatory agencies like the SEC onto market participants. People can approach a token investment based on the risk tolerance they prefer and the due diligence they conduct. Businesses can raise capital in much smaller amounts at much faster speeds, and they need not worry about meeting the high bars set by regulators and regulated exchanges (which also includes very high fees to apply or list their securities). If an entrepreneur is able to quickly procure the things needed to convince his investors, he no longer needs to worry about filling hundreds of pages of forms for regulators and exchanges, and paying massive fees to attorneys in the process. He can simply identify his investor set and launch a token, while upholding his end of the bargain to accrue value to the token once his business starts becoming profitable. To the government, this is also arguably a much more preferable option. Regulatory offices cost a lot of taxpayer money. If people want to launch tokens for their businesses and others want to invest in the token, then it makes sense to just let everyone do what they want to do with their own money and time, save on all the expense of having a lot of regulators, and then come back to collect tax revenue once the ventures have succeeded. By lowering the cost to access capital and by bypassing traditional gatekeepers, crypto can create a freer, more efficient market where honest businesses thrive, and bad actors are increasingly identified and ignored. This shift could mark the beginning of a new chapter for crypto, where the focus moves from speculation to real-world utility. It would also mark the start of a monumental change in how smaller enterprises can access capital markets. Picks for This Cycle As token-based capital formation gains traction, the broader crypto market is likely to experience significant growth. However, not all cryptocurrencies are positioned to benefit equally. I believe Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and Solana (SOL-USD) are the best crypto picks. Coinbase ( COIN ) and Robinhood ( HOOD ) are the equities that can benefit disproportionately from this trend. Bitcoin Bitcoin remains the ultimate decentralized digital commodity. As token-based fundraising grows, BTC’s role as the reserve asset of crypto is likely to strengthen. Institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, and its integration into traditional finance further solidify its position as a must-have asset for long-term investors seeking exposure to crypto. The importance of BTC really cannot be understated. I view it as far bigger than the rest of crypto because it has the potential to become a global monetary asset. The use of BTC as a reserve asset in corporate treasures is also a trend that is continuing. More companies are adding BTC to balance sheets and this trend is very likely to accelerate now that institutional acceptance of BTC via ETFs, options, futures, and FASB accounting treatment of digital assets. So the best way by far to play this crypto cycle is to simply own BTC. Solana Solana is emerging as the chain of choice for token launches, including the TRUMP and MELANIA memecoins. Solana has fast transaction speeds and low fees. Total value locked on the chain has continued to climb and is gaining market share from the other chains. TVL (Defillam) Solana has become a hotbed for memecoin activity, and its infrastructure supports businesses looking to launch tokens efficiently and affordably. These flows accrue value to the SOL token because SOL is used to pay for all blockchain network fees on Solana. Also, in the major token launchpads on Solana, SOL is the asset that is used to trade against the newly launched tokens. In other words, rather than XYZ-USD, the pair will be XYZ-SOL. In contrast, Ethereum (ETH-USD) is somewhat losing ground. Higher gas fees and network congestion make it less appealing for the next wave of token-based capital formation. Ethereum faces the larger question of L2’s becoming cannibalistic to blockspace and therefore not actually accruing value to the ETH token. Without getting into weeds on this, the bottom line is that there is likely more upside in SOL than in ETH. After TRUMP was launched on Solana, ETH actually lost value and the SOL-ETH pair traded much higher and the BTC-ETH pair reached a low that it hadn’t reached in years. It really seems like people are becoming increasingly bearish on ETH and viewing Solana as the chain where things will happen. I expect that SOL will flip ETH in market cap within the next 2 years. Coinbase and Robinhood Both COIN and HOOD are pick and shovels equities plays for crypto adoption. I was quite surprised that Robinhood moved so fast in listing TRUMP. While initial token launches can only be purchased by participating on-chain with a crypto wallet, as the tokens get larger they eventually get listed on crypto exchanges. COIN and HOOD can make a lot of money here. To get the assets to fund a crypto wallet, a user generally needs to buy it from a venue like COIN and HOOD. If a user wants to trade tokens without a crypto wallet, then they can just trade it natively in the Coinbase or Robinhood app. It’s easy to see that these two stocks could benefit from a crypto-friendly U.S. regulatory climate. Risks There is a chance that Trump’s memecoin launch has emboldened scammers without providing confidence to honest businesses. In this case, we could see a proliferation of scams, and this would be bad for the industry. Despite Trump’s high-profile involvement and signaled support, regulatory uncertainty in other jurisdictions remains a possible challenge. Crypto is global, so government crackdowns on token launches could hinder price performance. In the long term, it is safe to say that most other larger developed economies tend to follow the U.S. lead. I think another market risk that needs to be discussed is the risk to public equities. This development is so new and rapidly moving that it is tough to make a decisive call on what will happen. Directionally, I believe it is somewhat bearish for smaller cap stocks in more “innovative” sectors like tech and consumer discretionary. If tokens truly unlock unprecedented capital formation opportunities for smaller businesses, then it would mean that some attention and capital is pulled out of public markets and into crypto. This could be a long-term headwind for small and micro caps. Being publicly traded, these companies cannot move as quickly as to launch their own tokens to benefit from this trend. The best they can feasibly do is to adopt a BTC treasury. The Bottom Line Token-based capital formation is likely coming. By breaking regulatory taboos and legitimizing the use of tokens, Trump has opened the door for businesses to raise capital using far more efficient rails. This shift could catalyze a new wave of crypto adoption, creating opportunities for investors and businesses alike. For those looking to capitalize on this trend, BTC, SOL, COIN, and HOOD stand out to me as top picks, though I think focusing on BTC is the best choice. These assets are poised to lead the way, offering exposure to adoption, de-regulation, and innovation. If the era of tokenized capital is here, then those who position themselves early can stand to benefit greatly from the reshaping of capital markets and capital formation.",BTC-USD|ETH-USD|SOL-USD|IWM|DOGE-USD,EN,0,0,MARKET|SOL|BUSINESS|BTC|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-01-21 10:00:50

Good or Bad for Bitcoin?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/what-does-it-mean-for-donald-trump-and-melania-trump-to-issue-their-own-memecoin-good-or-bad-for-bitcoin/,"Bitcoin (BTC) rose to an all-time high of $109,350.72 earlier today before falling sharply during a volatile trading day coinciding with the inauguration of President Donald Trump. While price action mirrors a classic “buy the rumor, sell the news” scenario, optimism was fueled last week by speculation that Trump could prioritize cryptocurrencies early in his administration. Rumors suggested potential announcements of a crypto advisory council and even the establishment of a U.S. Bitcoin reserve, adding to the bullish sentiment. In addition to the weekend action, Trump launched the “Official Trump” memecoin, which quickly reached a market value of $10 billion, according to CoinGecko. First Lady Melania Trump also launched her own “Melania” memecoin, which reached a trading volume of $7.2 billion the other day. Gracy Chen, CEO of crypto exchange Bitget, said the rally in Bitcoin was driven by policy speculation rather than the launch of memecoins. “Without the launch of Trump family tokens, the price of Bitcoin would have increased more. Instead, capital flowed into new coins, limiting overall growth,” he said.

Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX, suggested that the launch of these tokens signals an open-minded approach to crypto. “Approving memecoins, the wildest crypto assets, is a way for the administration to show how supportive it can be of crypto adoption and position the U.S. as a leader in this space,” Kruger said. Economist and author of the Crypto is Macro Now newsletter Noelle Acheson echoed this view, calling the memecoin launches a “net positive effect” and a sign that Trump supports “new ideas and new markets.” Bitcoin’s rally cooled on Monday, but analysts see more upside potential. Kruger noted that the new high opens the door for a possible extension to $130,000 if the market remains optimistic about crypto-friendly policies. *This is not investment advice.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Binance Coin, Solana, and Rollblock are set to deliver significant returns in January, with Rollblock’s presale raising $9 million and showing 50x potential for 2025. Table of Contents Rollblock takes steps toward gaming dominance in Q1 Binance Coin ready for a four-figure price tag Solana, the chain of choice for President Trump Rollblock delivering on GambleFi promise Binance Coin, Solana, and Rollblock (RBLK) are poised to deliver significant returns in January, as 2025 shapes up to be a fantastic year for altcoins. While experts predict bullish action for Binance Coin and Solana, many believe that Rollblock will outperform the entire market with 50x potential as its highly popular presale offering hits new all-time highs and closes in on $9 million raised. Rollblock takes steps toward gaming dominance in Q1 Rollblock is a new type of GambleFi protocol that leverages the immutable Ethereum blockchain to provide gamers with a verifiable record of all transactions, stamping out any risk of bet fixing. This is a game-changer for an industry that has seen years of criminal activity with no comeback for everyday gamers until now. The Rollblock offering is truly exceptional and consists of over 7,000 casino classics, from poker to roulette, and huge numbers of slot machines. A brand-new sports betting league has also recently been rolled out to huge success and helped to deliver more than $1.75 million in wagered bets last month . Every Rollblock game is powered by the latest AI technology and features immersive live dealer modes that perfectly recreate the buzz of a real-life brick-and-mortar casino. Rollblock is fully crypto-native and accepts deposits in more than 20 different cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Solana, and Tether (USDT). The RBLK token has a deflationary supply thanks to its profit-sharing mechanism, which takes up to 30% of casino profits to buy up RBLK, going on to burn 60% of these tokens to reduce the supply and allocating the remaining 40% to staking rewards. With growing scarcity and a rapidly increasing demand, RBLK is set to reprice to the upside in the coming weeks from its current discount of $0.046. Binance Coin ready for a four-figure price tag Binance Coin is currently pushing up against resistance at $700, as it has rallied by 5.5% in the last seven days to hit $697. Binance Coin has now reached a market cap of $100.3 billion and is sitting at number 6 in the CoinMarketCap crypto top 10. 24-hour trading volume surged by 31% in the last few days as the Binance Coin market saw massive inflows. The inauguration of Donald Trump has led many Binance Coin traders to return to the floor, anticipating a coming Q1 pump as a more dovish administration enters the White House. Trump’s presidency should see US exchanges flourish, which could easily send Binance Coin to $1000 in the coming months. Solana, the chain of choice for President Trump Solana has had an incredibly volatile week, hitting a new all-time high of $293 before crashing back to $232. It has since stabilized at $260 after a record-breaking weekend of volume as the incoming president, Donald Trump, launched his TRUMP meme token on the Solana network. Solana is currently up an astonishing 47% over the last seven days. Solana took in record-breaking transaction fees of over $35 million as Trump’s memecoin surged on Friday night. This boosted Solana’s TVL to more than $12 billion, and despite network congestion, Solana handled the volume well, which stress-tested the Solana chain and will likely see Solana dominate the remainder of this cycle. Rollblock delivering on GambleFi promise Rollblock remains the best risk-to-reward ratio for outsized gains in 2025, as Binance Coin and Solana have already attained market caps of hundreds of billions. Rollblock has the momentum to deliver outstanding gains in 2025, and huge numbers of investors are piling into stage 9 before the inevitable price hike in the days to come.

This resulted in massive volatility and price slumps for the market, with BTC dumping from its latest all-time high to $100,000. The altcoins have suffered even more, especially reps of the ever-volatile meme coin sector. BTC’s Nosedive The weekend turned out to be a lot more eventful than many expected due to the launch of two consecutive meme coins by the now First Family. The primary cryptocurrency managed to defend its position and remained relatively still above $103,000. Moreover, it jumped to over $106,000 on Sunday before it plunged hard on Monday morning to just under $100,000. It managed to bounce off almost immediately and shot up to a new all-time high of just under $110,000. Following these already quite painful moves for some over-leveraged traders, more volatility was expected later during the day as all eyes were on the US presidential ceremony. Once that began, BTC tumbled by five grand within minutes to $102,000. It bounced off during the speech but dropped once again as it ended due to the lack of any mentions of crypto whatsoever. The largest digital asset dropped to $100,000 before it added a few grand and now sits above $102,000. Its market capitalization stands at $2.03 trillion, while its dominance over the alts is still at 55.4%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Alts Bleed Out As it typically happens when BTC heads south in a violent fashion, so do the alts. Ethereum, Binance Coin, Chainlink, and Toncoin are among the least declining assets, with price losses of up to 3-4%. In contrast, XRP is down by 6%, AVAX, XLM, and HBAR by around 8%, while SOL, DOGE, and ADA have plunged by up to 10.5%. The biggest daily losers come from the meme coin space, with FARTCOIN dumping by 28% and TRUMP slumping by 27%. The total crypto market cap is down by over $200 billion since yesterday to $3.670 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.
