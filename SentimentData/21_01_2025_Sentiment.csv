The crypto has seen a 9.14% rise over the past week and a remarkable 52.42% increase over the past 6 months. Current movements suggest BTC could climb further, potentially testing the resistance level at $116,283. With a Relative Strength Index at 58.67, Bitcoin is on the verge of entering an overbought zone, indicating continued interest from buyers. The 10-day Simple Moving Average shows more strength than the 100-day average, reinforcing this bullish outlook. Should the momentum continue, Bitcoin might even aim for the next resistance at $133,437, a potential upside of over 20%.

Donald Trump’s DOGE Under Scrutiny From Law firm According to a January 20 report from The Washington Post , National Security Counselors has filed a lawsuit based upon accusations that DOGE violates federal transparency requirements. A lawsuit was filed against Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy’s new nongovernmental entity as soon as Donald Trump was officially president. https://t.co/1ZQnybii3H — The Washington Post (@washingtonpost) January 20, 2025 Documents obtained by The Washington Post reveal that the so-called “public interest law firm” alleges that DOGE fails to follow long-standing executive branch hiring and disclosure practices. National Security Counselors claim that DOGE fits the categorization of a federal advisory committee, an entity that has specific standards of governance including filing a charter of governance which DOGE has allegedly yet to do. Despite these allegations, Trump remains confident in the project and its leadership. Trump announced the project in November 2024. He tapped both Musk and former Republican Party candidate Vivek Ramaswamy to lead the initiative, which focuses heavily on reducing governmental “red tape” and excessive spending. You might also like Donald Trump Taps Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy to Oversee Department of Government Efficiency “Together, these two wonderful Americans will pave the way for my Administration to dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal agencies,” Trump said in part in a November 2024 statement. However, reports emerged over the weekend that Ramaswamy may look to depart the newfound advisory committee in light of tensions within DOGE itself, though he has yet to publicly comment on the allegations. Ramaswamy is reportedly planning to announce his campaign for Ohio governor as soon as the end of the month. Elon Musk Continues DOGE Work Amid Ramaswamy Rift Reports Ramaswamy’s DOGE departure and the panel’s lawsuit come at a critical point for Trump, who has already invoked several executive orders upon taking office, one of which designated digital assets as a “national priority.” President Trump, who played a role in launching his family’s crypto platform World Liberty Financial last year, has long promised to implement crypto-friendly regulations upon his return to the White House. “We will have regulations,” Trump stated at the Bitcoin 2024 Conference this past summer, adding, “but from now on, the rules will be written by the people who love your industry, not hate your industry. Trump has also tapped former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins to lead the federal regulator following years of stringent crypto enforcement by now-resigned SEC chair Gary Gensler. With Trump now officially back in the White House, it seems as though a crypto regulatory framework is closer to happening than ever before.

Table of Contents The Dogecoin success story WallitIQ: The Ethereum token to transform crypto investments Conclusion During the 2021 bull run, a famous analyst turned a strategic Dogecoin (DOGE) investment into a $30 million profit, earning worldwide acclaim. This crypto visionary has identified a new opportunity in WallitIQ (WLTQ), suggesting the Ethereum token poised for a 34,550% rally with its $0.0420 presale. The Dogecoin success story Dogecoin started as a meme token but soon became a market phenomenon. In 2021, DOGE skyrocketed from under $0.01 to its all-time high of $0.74, influenced by community enthusiasm and endorsements from high-profile figures like Elon Musk. Currently trading at $0.3591, the Dogecoin price shows potential for a rebound, with analysts predicting a climb to $1. However, the days of astronomical returns seem gone. Recognizing this, the famous analyst has shifted focus to WallitIQ, which promises greater upside. You might also like: Crypto expert advises buying WallitIQ at $0.04 before it’s too late WallitIQ: The Ethereum token to transform crypto investments WallitIQ has succeeded from its first presale stage to the current phase. Starting at $0.0171, the token’s price has surged to $0.0420, reflecting a 71.43% increase, with the price set to jump to $0.0620 in the fourth stage. With over $7 million generated in revenue and $5 million more expected to be raised in its current presale stage, the Ethereum token has become a favorite among investors. One of the key drivers behind WallitIQ’s success is its recently announced MVP build of a crypto wallet management mobile app. Designed to simplify wallet and transaction management, the app offers wallet management tools for ETH and USDT wallets. It also generates QR codes for easy payment receipt so users can test the Scan and Pay QR feature. The platform’s crypto wallet management mobile app is integrated with CoinGecko’s API. The API captures all price data including the opening, closing, highest, and lowest prices of all crypto tickers. Thus, users will always have an all-around view of their assets’ market performance. The app also features candlestick charts for all tickers. Users can view these by tapping on any ticker, and the chart will pop up. With interactive controls and an adjustable timeframe, users and traders can apply data-driven strategies for success. In addition to its SolidProof audit , these features make WallitIQ a potential solution for modern crypto investors, driving confidence. Experts predict WLTQ’s price could climb to $12 post-launch, representing a 34,550% increase. As such, the WallitIQ presale offers an opportunity to potentially secure gains comparable to Dogecoin’s. Conclusion The story of the famous analyst turning Dogecoin into a $30 million success is a testament to the power of early investments in promising projects. With a 34,550% rally predicted for WallitIQ, this Ethereum token could represent the next chapter in crypto success stories.

Per Hanguk Kyungjae , the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), has processed the application of the cryptoasset brokerage platform company Happy Block. VASP License Approval: Opening the Door to Corporate BTC Buying? The approval comes hot on the heels of the FIU’s decision to grant a VASP license to another brokerage – named Waybridge – in late December last year. A South Korean crypto exchange customer trades Bitcoin. (Source: YTN Science Today/YouTube/Screenshot) The FIU operates under the auspices of the country’s top regulator, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) . The unit is the only body in the country with the power to grant companies virtual asset service provider (VASP) licenses. Until the past few weeks, only a handful of crypto exchanges have managed to secure VASP permits. Since Seoul started policing the crypto industry in earnest in 2018, all crypto brokerages have had to shut up shop. However, the FSC appears ready to soften its famously hardline stance on crypto regulation in 2025. The investigators appear to have hit a wall in questioning President Yoon Suk Yeol. https://t.co/j31H8HQEZu #YoonSukYeol #SouhtKorea #Investigation — The Korea Herald 코리아헤럴드 (@TheKoreaHerald) January 20, 2025 Regulator Speaks of ‘Gradual’ Reform The FSC has refused to commit itself to crypto deregulation. But it has suggested it could “review” its policy on allowing companies to buy BTC and other cryptoassets with their balance sheets. The Happy Block approval appears to be a step in this direction. The firm is “a digital assets brokerage company” that launched in May 2022. It calls itself a “digital securities company” and has reportedly been “preparing virtual asset brokerage services for corporations.” Its high-profile backers include SK Securities, and it also has partnership deals with overseas players like Fireblocks and Kaico. The firm is also developing a platform for “institutional investors,” with integrated management, custody, and personal crypto wallet services. It was just minutes after a South Korean court issued a fresh warrant to detain President Yoon Suk Yeol when a group of his supporters turned violent and started storming the courthouse https://t.co/QggOVHyvM7 — Bloomberg Politics (@bpolitics) January 20, 2025 Companies Keen on Crypto The company also plans to provide over-the-counter (OTC) brokerage services for crypto orders and “bulk transactions for institutions.” A wide range of South Korean companies are thought to be keen to buy BTC and other tokens. However, they are currently unable to do so, as FSC guidelines to banks effectively prohibit financial institutions from letting corporate customers open crypto exchange-linked accounts. This is because financial regulators have ruled that virtual assets “are not financial investment products under the terms of the Capital Market Act.” However, the same media outlet wrote that the FSC has “been moving to ease regulations related to virtual assets, albeit slowly, this year.” The FSC has stated that it will be “gradual” with the process. Industry insiders think that public bodies will first be granted the right to sell crypto donations before other firms get the green light. An unnamed South Korean financial investment industry insider told the media outlet: “Currently, even in the US, traditional securities firms do not handle receiving orders for cryptoassets managed by asset management companies.” Financial group chiefs stress Korea's robust fundamentals to offshore investors https://t.co/9yHPJEybTP — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) January 19, 2025 Bitcoin ETF Approval Next? The same insider added that the move could also eventually see the FSC open the door to Bitcoin spot ETF approval. The source said: “If domestic virtual asset ETFs are introduced, there will naturally be a need for bodies who can execute institutional investor orders. Crypto brokerage companies have been preparing for that very role. I believe the FSC approved the [VASP application] because it deemed it necessary [for Bitcoin ETF approval].” However, the FSC has made cagey statements on calls to approve Bitcoin spot ETFs. Earlier this year, the FSC Director Kwon Dae-young said that Bitcoin ETF approval would be going “a step too far.” Gangnam, in Seoul, South Korea. The district is home to most of the nation’s biggest crypto companies. (Source: Gdog (CC BY-SA 3.0]) But Kwon conceded that the government was “fully aware of the changes [in crypto regulation] that are taking place globally.” Meanwhile, Happy Block CEO Kim Gyu-yoon said that the firm was “planning to pursue business in line with the policy direction of financial regulators.” Kim promised to “respond to major issues such as investor protection , anti-money laundering, and taxation issues.” The CEO also mentioned the need to “carry out business in accordance” with regulators’ “schedule for introducing spot ETFs.” The company’s wait for VASP approval has been a long one. Around a year and five months have passed since Happy Block first submitted its application to the FIU.

At the time of writing, the ETH/BTC trading pair stands at 0.031, marking a four-year low for the ratio. ETH/BTC Continues To Decline As Trump Focuses On Bitcoin Over the past year, Bitcoin has appreciated by an impressive 158%, surging from approximately $41,000 on January 21, 2024, to $107,608 at the time of writing. The cryptocurrency has consistently reached new all-time highs (ATH) throughout the year. In contrast, Ethereum has delivered a modest return of approximately 35% over the same period and remains 32% below its November 2021 ATH of $4,878. Related Reading: Will Ethereum Bounce Back? Crypto Analysts Discuss Potential Price Recovery According to the weekly chart below from TradingView, the ETH/BTC trading pair — also referred to as the ETH/BTC ratio within the crypto industry — has reached a fresh four-year low. This decline has raised concerns about the likelihood of an Ethereum-led altcoin season. Currently trading at 0.031, the ETH/BTC ratio has erased all gains accumulated since March 2021. The pair peaked at 0.087 in December 2021, during the height of that year’s altcoin season. Since then, however, Ethereum, the second-largest digital asset by market capitalization, has experienced a steady decline against Bitcoin. In May 2024, the ratio fell below 0.054, a critical support level that had previously held firm in June 2022. Several factors have contributed to Ethereum’s underperformance, including Trump’s perceived preference for Bitcoin and the rising competition from rival smart-contract platforms like Solana (SOL). Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum has struggled with adoption. Corporations worldwide are increasingly incorporating Bitcoin into their balance sheets, reinforcing BTC’s status as a premier digital asset. Additionally, speculation about the creation of a US strategic Bitcoin reserve has further bolstered the narrative around Bitcoin’s limited supply, driving its price higher. Conversely, Ethereum’s relatively high issuance rate has cast doubt on its “ultrasound money” narrative. Ethereum’s 2024 performance has also eroded confidence among some of its largest holders. Notably, an ETH whale recently sold 10,070 ETH at a $1 million loss, signaling waning investor trust. Will 2025 Change Ethereum’s Fortunes? While 2024 was a challenging year for Ethereum in terms of price performance, crypto analysts remain optimistic about the asset’s prospects in 2025. For example, a report by Steno Research predicts that Ethereum could surge to as high as $8,000 this year. Related Reading: Ethereum Poised For A Bullish Q1 2025? Here’s What Experts Say Similarly, crypto analyst Daan forecasts that the ETH/BTC trading pair could rise above 0.04 during Q1 2025. In December 2024, Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experienced renewed interest from institutional investors, fueling hopes for significant capital inflows into the smart-contract platform. That said, Ethereum must first overcome strong resistance at the $4,000 price level. At press time, ETH trades at $3,368, down 1.3% in the past 24 hours.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Crypto experts select Rollblock as the next potential altcoin star after Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Table of Contents Meme coin favorites still going strong Rollblock steals the show Conclusion Many crypto fans have watched the rise of Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) with great excitement over the past few years. Both tokens grabbed headlines by turning simple memes into global phenomena, driving their market caps to impressive heights. Today, a fresh contender named Rollblock (RBLK) is stepping into the spotlight, drawing attention as a possible multi-billion dollar gem. Enthusiasts searching for the best crypto presales are starting to notice how Rollblock could fuse real online gaming with rewarding tokenomics. Some analysts highlight the project’s focus on transparency and weekly revenue sharing, seeing it as a sign that Rollblock could transform digital gambling. Fans of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu remain curious about whether this newcomer can truly match — or even exceed — meme coin hype. It helps that RBLK stands on solid fundamentals, unlike coins that rely only on internet buzz. Meme coin favorites still going strong Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have both claimed major market positions. With DOGE having a market cap around $53 billion and SHIB at $12 billion, these playful cryptos have proven to be more than a fad. Interestingly, analysts often check the Dogecoin price for signs of renewed surges. Shiba Inu also draws constant attention as the next loved meme coin. However, meme coins face challenges in proving their real-world usefulness. While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu remain symbols of community power, some investors are shifting toward tokens with clear benefits. This movement could give Rollblock and RBLK the opening they need to thrive.

By offering up to 30% of its casino profits to RBLK holders through regular buybacks and burns, Rollblock will create a deflationary effect that can boost token value. Additionally, stakers can earn extra rewards simply by holding their coins. Rollblock is also forging a clear path with licensing, security audits, and advanced features like AI-based betting tools. The focus on fairness and real earnings could make Rollblock a top choice for those who want more than quick speculative profits. With a steady plan to lock team tokens for 24 months, the developers show they are in it for the long haul. Rollblock aims to appeal to everyday users who like online gaming but crave something that offers lasting value. Conclusion In a market that values both fun and utility, Rollblock has a strong chance to capture attention and deliver real results. Thanks to its detailed strategy that rewards token holders, protects user funds, and releases exciting gaming features, RBLK might become the next multi-billion dollar star.

The trader, identified by the Solana address 4zo6…zHF2, exchanged 800,000 USD Coin (USDC) on Jan. 20 and converted it into 16.45 million USDC in just 12 hours, achieving nearly 2000% gains. Another trader reportedly turned $560,000 into $11.5 million by investing in MELANIA, while a third pocketed $47.5 million in profits. These massive gains came as MELANIA’s price soared by 25,600% within 12 hours of its launch across various crypto exchanges. Melania Trump’s verified X account announced the token, which quickly gained traction with around 500,000 holders, according to DEX Screener. The token has also become the 10th most traded cryptocurrency by volume. MELANIA’s meteoric rise coincided with the buzz surrounding Donald Trump’s second-term inauguration and the debut of his own memecoin, Official TRUMP ($TRUMP). The TRUMP token, released shortly before MELANIA, climbed into the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap, reaching a fully diluted value of approximately $50 billion. Concerns About MELANIA’s Transparency Despite its rapid success, MELANIA has faced criticism regarding its token distribution and project transparency. Blockchain analytics platform Bubblemaps revealed that nearly 90% of MELANIA’s supply is controlled by a single wallet, raising doubts about the fairness of its distribution. Additionally, the token’s website, launched a day before its debut, has been criticized for weak cybersecurity and subpar development. Coinbase executive Conor Grogan commented that MELANIA appeared less professionally managed than the TRUMP token, likening it to a project run by “college kids.” While doubts remain about MELANIA’s transparency and execution, its unprecedented gains have fueled excitement and speculation in the crypto space.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,USDC|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-20 23:52:00

Meanwhile, the SUI coin price continues to show volatility, as cryptocurrency analysts monitor its potential to rebound. At BlockDAG, the recruitment of Marius Bock, previously a major figure at Cardano, introduces new leadership and strategic insights to the initiative. BlockDAG (BDAG) has achieved notable progress, and with Bock’s deep experience, it is well-positioned for further achievements. The BDAG coin, now in its presale phase with over $182 million collected, is currently among the top trending crypto assets. Trump’s Policy Expectations Propel Toncoin’s Expansion in the U.S. Market The TON Foundation, linked with Telegram Messenger LLP, is actively pursuing Toncoin (TON) expansion in the United States, encouraged by projected favorable regulatory changes under the new Trump leadership. The foundation’s recent onboarding of Manuel Stotz, an experienced founder of Kingsway Capital Partners Ltd., signifies a major move in strengthening its position in the U.S. As the foundation intensifies its efforts, Toncoin (TON) has captured significant market attention, with its value reflecting growing interest. This strategy highlights the foundation’s readiness to capitalize on expected regulatory developments. Varied Indicators for SUI Coin Price This Week The SUI coin price has experienced fluctuating performance this week, mirroring both prospects and obstacles in the current marketplace. After climbing 10% to $4.76 following Bitcoin’s support at $92,000, the SUI coin price then fell by 4.3%, underscoring its dependency on Bitcoin’s trends. Technical analysts emphasize the significance of the Yearly Open as a pivotal support and the possibilities for further stabilization near Fibonacci retracement levels. With Bitcoin challenging major resistance points, the SUI coin price is under scrutiny for potential upward movements, as the market anticipates a broader bullish trend from leading digital currencies. BlockDAG Accelerates with New Leadership from Former Cardano Executive Marius Bock has joined BlockDAG as Lead Project Manager, bringing extensive expertise from over 25 years in blockchain and fintech. His leadership at Cardano, where he directed the development of cryptocurrency wallet technologies, highlights his proficiency in managing advanced projects. During his tenure at Visa, he led mobile money initiatives across various nations, proving his ability to oversee expansive projects successfully. These experiences demonstrate his skill in delivering significant outcomes within diverse industries and technologies. With Marius at the helm, BlockDAG is poised to fully utilize its capabilities. His experience in leading large teams and implementing scalable projects is set to enhance the network’s structure, paving the way for a robust ecosystem conducive to decentralized applications. Marius’s efforts to upgrade the network’s functions will ensure BlockDAG remains a preferred platform for developers and users alike, promoting wider acceptance and steady growth. His strategic leadership is anticipated to significantly boost the reliability and market competitiveness of the BlockDAG ecosystem. BlockDAG has already marked significant achievements, with its BDAG coin presale garnering over $182 million and selling 17.9 billion coins, experiencing a remarkable price increase of 2380%, from $0.001 to $0.0248 across 27 batches. As the mainnet launch draws near later this year, the chance to buy BDAG at presale prices is diminishing quickly. As BlockDAG continues to reach new heights, it solidifies its status as a top trending crypto, drawing increasing interest from traders keen on joining its swift growth. Market Developments to Watch As Toncoin’s (TON) expansion progresses in the U.S., the scenario looks promising due to anticipated supportive regulations with the Trump administration. The SUI coin price also seems promising, attracting market attention due to its potential for recovery. Yet, the spotlight is on BlockDAG, particularly with Marius Bock’s impactful entry. His leadership, combined with the team’s strategic plans, propels BlockDAG towards further growth. Now in the 27th batch of a highly successful presale, the BDAG coin has raised over $182 million, showing immense potential for growth. With a solid groundwork laid, it has become a top trending crypto , making this an opportune moment to engage before its value soars.

Cardano Enhances Governance & Solana Rolls Out a Memecoin,https://thecoinrise.com/investors-rave-over-web3bay-blockchain-transforms-e-commerce-cardano-enhances-governance-solana-rolls-out-a-memecoin/,"The cryptocurrency landscape is busy as Cardano rolls out its latest governance features and Solana’s meme coin, TRUMP, amplifies its market presence. Meanwhile, Web3Bay (3BAY) has captured the imagination and excitement of investors by uniquely merging blockchain technology with e-commerce. This integration promises to revolutionize the shopping experience, offering secure, transparent transactions and significant perks for token holders. Priced attractively at just $0.0045626 in its ongoing fourth presale stage, Web3Bay has already raised $830,000 and sold 220 million tokens, signaling strong market confidence and setting up early investors for an impressive potential ROI of 6,430%. Cardano Advances: Enhancing Security & Engagement Cardano has seen noteworthy price volatility, reaching highs of $1.16 and lows of $1.054, with a recent trading price of $1.061. The implementation of the Chang hard fork marks a significant milestone in Cardano’s development towards decentralized governance, enhancing user engagement in decision-making processes. These enhancements are designed to solidify Cardano’s position in the crypto market by promoting a more democratic governance model and potentially fostering new collaborations and partnerships. This focus on decentralized governance is expected to enhance the platform’s resilience against security threats and increase its appeal to a broader base of developers. Additionally, Cardano’s commitment to regular updates and community involvement positions it as a leader in sustainable and scalable blockchain solutions. Solana’s Market Surge: The Impact of TRUMP Memecoin Solana’s recent trading figures are impressive, with a current price of $240.47, having achieved highs of $243.26 and lows of $216.47. The launch of the TRUMP meme coin has not only increased Solana’s market cap to nearly $9 billion but also significantly enhanced its visibility in the crypto space. This surge in attention could be further bolstered by favorable regulatory developments expected with the new pro-crypto administration, potentially leading to the approval of cryptocurrency ETFs that could attract more institutional investors to Solana. The platform’s high throughput and low transaction costs make it an ideal choice for developers looking to build scalable applications, contributing to its rapid growth in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. As Solana continues to develop and integrate new features, it is poised to become a major player in the blockchain ecosystem, competing directly with more established platforms. Secure, Scalable, & Affordable: Web3Bay’s Tech Sets New Standards During the dynamic shifts in the cryptocurrency sector, Web3Bay stands out by effectively merging blockchain technology with e-commerce. This strategic integration not only streamlines transactions but also fortifies security, setting a new benchmark for online retail. The platform’s advanced design supports scalable growth through the use of smart contracts and decentralized protocols, enhancing transactional efficiency and reliability. Web3Bay’s current presale, now in its fourth stage, has successfully raised $830,000 and sold 220 million tokens, demonstrating robust investor confidence and market potential. Priced at just $0.0045626 per token, Web3Bay is making a compelling case as an affordable yet promising investment opportunity in the digital marketplace. Web3Bay’s blockchain framework provides a secure and transparent environment where users can enjoy benefits such as 5% discounts on purchases and governance rights, which enhance user engagement and loyalty. By adopting innovative technologies like NFTs and offering tokenized rewards, Web3Bay is not just revolutionizing the e-commerce landscape but is also setting the stage for a new era of digital commerce that prioritizes consumer empowerment and security. As the platform continues to expand its offerings and user base, the demand for 3BAY tokens is expected to rise, potentially leading to significant gains for early investors. These presale achievements and the strategic advantages offered by Web3Bay highlight its potential to reshape and dominate the e-commerce sector through blockchain innovation. Wrapping Up While projects like Cardano and Solana continue to draw attention with their respective innovations and speculative appeal, Web3Bay focuses on delivering long-term value through a utility-driven approach. By eliminating common e-commerce challenges such as high transaction fees and centralization, Web3Bay not only enhances the shopping experience but also paves the way for the future of decentralized retail. With $830,000 already raised and innovative features like NFT integration and staking on the horizon, Web3Bay is not just another crypto token; it’s at the forefront of transforming how we think about buying and selling in the digital world. For investors seeking a blend of innovation, scalability, and solid returns, Web3Bay offers a compelling option, marking it as a leader in the next evolution of e-commerce.

XRP price surges 42% in a week XRP has grabbed headlines over the past seven days after becoming the best-performing altcoin in the top 10. On January 9, the XRP price was hovering around $2.32. After holding this level for days, the XRP price spiked sharply on January 14 due to increasing demand from traders. This demand came as the SEC neared the January 15 deadline to file its appeals brief in its case against Ripple Labs and its executives. As a result of increased trading activity, the XRP price reclaimed the $3 level, which was last seen in 2018. The XRP price went as high as $3.36 on January 16 before stabilizing around $3.32.

However, analysts believe this altcoin might soon reverse course and retest key support levels. Meanwhile, RCO Finance (RCOF), a new DeFi altcoin, has quickly gained popularity after securing over $11.19 million in funding during its presale. Which altcoin is poised to generate the highest returns between Dogecoin (DOGE) and RCO Finance (RCOF)? Read on to find out! Dogecoin Price Climbs 15% In A Week: What’s Next? Dogecoin has recorded notable gains over the past week. On January 9, the Dogecoin price was hovering around $0.3312. The Dogecoin price traded around this range for days before gaining momentum on January 15. This spike came after data from TradingView revealed that whales accumulated 470 million DOGE in 48 hours. This whale activity attracted hordes of traders, and the Dogecoin price soared as high as $0.3866 on January 16 before stabilizing at around $0.3841. This price means Dogecoin has gained 15% over the past week. However, analysts expect the Dogecoin price to correct downward and retest the $0.3500 support level as the buzz about the recent whale activity wanes. This explains why investors are shifting to RCO Finance (RCOF).

RCOF has captured investor attention because it has showcased impressive growth during its ongoing presale. As of January 16, RCOF had secured over $11.19 million in funding. Amazingly, RCOF has managed to raise these funds despite being in Stage 4 of its presale. RCOF’s price during this stage is $0.0778. This price is set to jump to $0.2142 when RCOF enters the Bonus Round, with more growth coming as this AI altcoin approaches its listing price of $0.4-$0.6.

Significant events are generating headlines for two of the biggest participants in the cryptocurrency space: Ethereum and Solana. The true action, however, is elsewhere: the smart investors are taking notice of Remittix (RTX) , a low-cap gem with the potential for phenomenal growth. Ethereum Upgrade Fuels Market Optimism The cryptocurrency economy has long relied on Ethereum and 2025 is expected to be another significant year. Significant improvements to the ecosystem are anticipated with the March Pectra Ethereum upgrade. From improved wallet functionality and account abstraction to advancements in zero knowledge cryptography, Pectra is poised to elevate Ethereum’s user experience, privacy and scalability. Core developers have already begun rolling out the Sepolia and Holesky features on Ethereum’s testnets. If everything goes as planned, the Ethereum upgrade might encourage additional users to sign up, further solidifying Ethereum's position as the industry leader in DeFi. Strong institutional interest is demonstrated by the net inflow of $166.6 million into Ethereum ETFs, which coincides with the technical improvements. Ethereum is battling resistance close to $3,400, displaying an inverted head and shoulders pattern that suggests bullish momentum. According to analysts, ETH may repeat its all time high of $4,868 following a breakout and if it maintains above significant resistance levels, it may even hit $6,000 in the future. However, in order to continue its bullish claim, the altcoin need to hold onto support close to $2,817. Solana Rides Meme Coin Hype The Solana network has performed exceptionally well, as seen by its price increase of nearly 32% to $253.22 in the last week. The surge is as a result of increased Solana network activity brought on by the introduction of a Trump meme coin that has taken liquidity away from other markets. This change has temporarily disrupted operations and because of the large volume of transactions, Binance recently paused SOL withdrawals, leaving customers anxious for regular operations to resume. The Solana network’s strong ecosystem and capacity to draw in liquidity make it a strong contender in the Layer-1 blockchain market despite this setback. Investors are making a bag from Solana's price momentum as it continues to surge. However, experienced traders are searching for more stable options, like Remittix because the meme coin hype rarely lasts. Why Remittix Could Be the Breakout Star of 2025 An increasing number of whales are turning their attention to Remittix (RTX) , a cutting edge payment network that combines blockchain technology with fiat transactions, even if Ethereum and Solana continue to dominate headlines. By allowing users to send bitcoin and have receivers receive fiat money straight into their bank accounts, Remittix provides a smooth cross border payment option. Remittix has raised over $3.7 million with a price of just $0.0221 during its presale phase, garnering recognition for its innovative strategy. The platform offers unmatched flexibility and financial inclusion by supporting more than 40 cryptocurrencies and 40 fiat currencies. Customers can avoid dealing with the hidden fees and bad exchange rates that are frequently connected to conventional banks and payment systems thanks to the platform’s clear flat fee model. What sets Remittix apart is its potential to disrupt the $183 trillion global payments industry. By combining blockchain technology with local payment networks, Remittix enables faster, cheaper and more secure transactions. Its API solutions, such as “Remittix Pay,” empower businesses and freelancers to accept crypto payments while settling in fiat, minimizing exposure to market volatility. Investors are particularly excited about the long term potential of RTX. With forecasts of a 25x multiplier during the presale and 1,500% gains after launch, Remittix is poised for exponential growth. Its smart contract has passed a full audit and plans to lock liquidity and team tokens for three years ensure transparency and stability. Conclusion Ethereum and Solana remain giants in the cryptocurrency market, with their respective developments promising substantial returns for investors. However, the real opportunity may lie in emerging projects like Remittix. Combining the best of traditional finance and blockchain technology, Remittix is redefining cross border payments and positioning itself as a leader in the PayFi space.

Major developments are capturing attention for two of the main players in the crypto world: Ethereum and Solana. Yet, the real action is happening elsewhere as savvy investors turn their gaze to Remittix (RTX) , a low-cap asset with the potential for remarkable growth. Ethereum's Upgrade Sparks Optimism Ethereum has been a cornerstone of the crypto economy, and 2025 is shaping up to be another pivotal year. The upcoming March Pectra upgrade promises significant enhancements to the Ethereum ecosystem. With features like improved wallet capabilities, account abstraction, and advances in zero-knowledge cryptography, Pectra aims to boost Ethereum's user experience, privacy, and scalability. Core developers have already started implementing Sepolia and Holesky on Ethereum testnets. If successful, the upgrade could attract more users, reinforcing Ethereum's role as a leader in decentralized finance. The $166.6 million net inflow into Ethereum ETFs, coupled with these technical upgrades, reflects strong institutional interest. Currently, Ethereum is facing resistance around $3,400, showing an inverted head and shoulders pattern that hints at bullish momentum. Analysts suggest that ETH could retest its previous peak of $4,868 after a breakout, and if it stays above key resistance levels, it might even reach $6,000. However, to sustain its upward trajectory, the altcoin needs to maintain support around $2,817. Solana Leverages Meme Coin Buzz Solana has been on a roll, with its price jumping nearly 32% to $253.22 over the past week. This surge is due to heightened activity on the Solana network, spurred by the launch of a Trump meme coin that has diverted liquidity from other markets. This shift has temporarily disrupted operations, and due to the high transaction volume, Binance recently paused SOL withdrawals, causing users to eagerly await the return to normal operations. Despite this hiccup, Solana's robust ecosystem and ability to attract liquidity make it a formidable competitor in the Layer-1 blockchain market. Investors are capitalizing on Solana's price momentum, but seasoned traders are also eyeing more stable options like Remittix, as the meme coin excitement is often short-lived. The Potential for Remittix to Shine in 2025 An increasing number of whales are shifting their focus to Remittix (RTX) , an innovative payment network that merges blockchain tech with fiat transactions, even though Ethereum and Solana continue to dominate the headlines. Remittix offers a seamless cross-border payment solution by allowing users to send bitcoin while recipients receive fiat directly into their bank accounts. During its presale phase, Remittix has already attracted over $3.7 million, priced at just $0.0221, thanks to its groundbreaking approach. Supporting more than 40 cryptocurrencies and 40 fiat currencies, the platform provides unmatched flexibility and financial inclusion.

Lord Barron Trump (BARTRUMP), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because BARTRUMP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Lord Barron Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Lord Barron Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Lord Barron Trump launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Lord Barron Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Lord Barron Trump by entering its contract address – D1na43rvB8ANQYK5KNJuYNK9RrAPaz9zevLGzw8DyZae – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like BARTRUMP. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|DOGE|SOL|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-21 00:06:00

But as is often the case in crypto, things haven't gone as planned for Dogecoin and the asset has been plummeting over the past 24 hours. On the sidelines, a rival altcoin at $0.0221 is emerging, that may soon eclipse Dogecoin. Remittix(RTX) is a revolutionary PayFi solution currently seeing major attention in its presale with its practical fixes for cross-border payment problems. Unlike Dogecoin (DOGE), Remittix is built around real-world practicality, and is taking the market by storm, with $3.85 million raised to date. So will Dogecoin (DOGE) bounce back from the brink, and how will Remittixfare this year? Dogecoin Sees Worrying 24 Hour Dip Dogecoin (DOGE) has wobbled its way through January, with some sporadic and short growth spurts throughout, most often preceding small dips. The weekly net gain for Dogecoin (DOGE) is now sitting at 15.38% but the asset has seen a rough 24 hours, dropping by 4.56%. Dogecoin is now trading at $0.3938 and its $7.26 billion 24 hour trading volume suggests many holders are selling off while others may be buying the dip. Much like other meme coins in the space, Dogecoin’s trajectory looks very uncertain as we settle into 2025. Remittix (RTX) Raises the Bar for Global Payments Remittix (RTX) combines the best features of blockchain and traditional banking to offer seamless crypto-to-fiat transactions. It facilitates the conversion of over 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat currencies and enables users to send funds to any global bank account with ease. Unlike traditional systems that often impose hidden fees, Remittix operates with a transparent flat-rate pricing model, ensuring recipients receive exactly what was sent. Unlike legacy systems, Remittix (RTX) eliminates hidden fees with its flat-rate pricing model. This model ensures that what users send is exactly what recipients receive, making it a more affordable and transparent solution than traditional banking options. Its instant transaction settlements are another key draw, offering users and businesses a reliable way to move funds across the globe. The Remittix Pay API is a major selling point for businesses, simplifying crypto payment acceptance and fiat settlement, allowing merchants to work effectively within the digital economy. Companies can even set up merchant accounts to manage conversions in over 30 fiat currencies and 50+ cryptocurrency pairs, offering optimal flexibility so that businesses can manage their finances in a way that works for them. Remittix’s vision extends beyond remittances, as it looks to bridge the gap between blockchain and real-world financial applications. The modular nature of the PayFi protocol means that it can integrate easily with different financial systems, which will allow it to scale in the future. Remittix Soars Past $3.75 Million Raised In Presale $RTX tokens are currently up for grabs in the presale for just $0.0221. The presale continues to build momentum, having raised more than $3.85 million from investors who see its massive potential to disrupt the $190 trillion global banking industry. Projections point to a800% price jump by the close of the presale and a possible 5,000% rally post-launch, making it one of the most promising opportunities in PayFi for 2025.

However, as often happens in the crypto world, Dogecoin's journey has been rocky, and the asset has been on a downward trend over the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, an emerging competitor altcoin, priced at $0.0221, is gaining traction and might soon surpass Dogecoin. Remittix(RTX) is an innovative PayFi solution that is attracting considerable attention during its presale due to its practical solutions for international payment challenges. Unlike Dogecoin (DOGE), Remittix is grounded in real-world utility and is capturing market interest, having already raised $3.85 million. Can Dogecoin (DOGE) recover from its current slump, and what does the future hold for Remittix this year? Dogecoin Faces a Concerning 24-Hour Decline Dogecoin (DOGE) has had a turbulent start to January, with intermittent bursts of growth often followed by small declines. Currently, Dogecoin (DOGE) boasts a weekly net gain of 15.38%, but it has experienced a challenging 24-hour period, with a drop of 4.56%. The cryptocurrency is now valued at $0.3938, and its trading volume over the past 24 hours has reached $7.26 billion, indicating a mix of holders selling and others taking advantage of the dip. Much like other meme coins in the cryptocurrency realm, Dogecoin's future trajectory remains highly uncertain as we progress into 2025. Remittix (RTX) Sets New Standards for International Transactions Remittix (RTX) blends the best of blockchain technology with traditional banking to facilitate smooth crypto-to-fiat exchanges.

However, in just a few days, the coin is already attracting legal and tax scrutiny. Fintax has highlighted three serious concerns about the launch of TRUMP. Critical among them is whether TRUMP qualifies as a security under US regulations. The US Security and Exchange Commission states that digital assets supplied through initial coin offerings (ICO) are qualified as securities as long as they meet the Howey Test Criteria. ICOs always make money by issuing crypto and pledging future returns. TRUMP has been launched publicly, but the team indicated on the TRUMP website that the coin isn’t a security. Besides, it has not alleged any future profits, making it difficult to call the meme coin a security. The SEC has not pronounced itself on the meme coin, but if TRUMP begins to act like a security, it will be under the SEC’s scrutiny and regulations. TRUMP is facing tax scrutiny, with the team holding up to 80% of the coin According to the IRS , profits from crypto investments are subject to capital tax. Trump’s team holds 80% of the meme coin supply, which will be unlocked periodically over the next three years. There is a dilemma on whether the unlocking event is taxable. US tax laws direct that capital gain tax takes effect when assets are sold or traded. Therefore, unlocking TRUMP won’t be taxable unless they are sold or used in transactions. The moment TRUMP is traded or exchanged into other assets, it will definitely attract capital gains based on the market price. Also, figuring out the cornerstone of TRUMP cost is a challenge. The US laws ensure that capital gains tax is pegged to the price at which you bought the asset. TRUMP has had wild price swings, making it impossible to establish the cost basis. If the team behind TRUMP sells the cryptos in sets, the capital gains will be calculated based on the timing and market prices of the batches. This makes it difficult to file taxes if proper sales records are not kept well. TRUMP could breach the law if used for political donations The meme coin is considered a potential controversy when it comes to political donations. The US law on Transparency and limits of political donations is very strict. If TRUMP is used to generate political funds, it could easily go past the set limits and break the law. Although there is no evidence of the coin being used for political donation, the idea of a politician launching a meme coin could have serious repercussions on the political donation systems.
